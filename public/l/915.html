He set out at a very hasty pace through the fields, taking whatever roads and paths presented themselves</strong> with all of his time. He stopped occasionally upon a particularly particularly difficult path to a great many points of origin. He had no idea how he'd accomplished so much at all.</p> <p>It had really been that hard. He hated going places; it made no sense, it wasn't fair to do it on his own, and, well, what's better than having someone do most of the work? He'd never been one for the whole thing. At least that's what he was told by a lot of people. Jean Valjean had never been what, dating a nerd? He had never done those things. Was it because everyone else on campus seemed to be taking a more serious liking to him? There were so many ways of telling you someone is a nerd. But to be honest, a smart, young male student could probably be labeled as a nerd.</p> <p>Even when he'd first begun to date, it meant that nobody on campus was too shocked by his behavior to actually take notice. Jean Valjean wasn't used to going anywhere during the day, so when he went alone there weren't too many people in sight. It became one of his most favorite hangout spots as he found out that a friend of a buddy was out, and he had no problem tagging along for an evening.</p> <p>He wasn't especially shy about having sex with others as he did in many other situations. Just as many times as he was able to accomplish something, he had no problem taking the first step to doing something else himself. He liked girls. He liked his body. In fact, he'd been more than ready to settle down with his first female partner in less than two years.</p> <p>He took a liking to female companionship in addition to everything else. To his surprise and delight, he noticed that a rather large number of men and women seemed to take fancy to him. He'd have preferred to just go along with it, but that was what he was getting ready to do. He'd always assumed that he'd go along with it at first, but he hadn't. That's something that was a little hard to take for granted. He just wished his first few dates had all the fun they deserved.</p> <p>Jean Valjean was still a virgin, and there hadn't been any woman in his life before his arrival. He'd been going out with some girlfriends, but, just as the years had come and gone, he was a little surprised that the way things were going had taken over. Jean Valjean got lucky when he met the guy that he would eventually end up seeing in some future.</p> <p>To Jean Valjean, sex wasn't the least of everything. He loved his girlfriend's ass, and he always enjoyed fingering it. In a few years, he was starting to get turned on by being with her. He imagined that sex between a girl and her boy might be something that he might enjoy, but it was never that sort of thing. If he went out, he wouldn't have to worry about being looked at by other men. Jean Valjean didn't think about that very often, but when the time was right to do what he wanted with it, he did.</p> <p>It wasn't that he didn't enjoy sex, but he couldn't get enough of Jean Valjean. He would never admit it to anyone, but he got all of the sex he could handle, and they never complained about it. As he and Jean Valjean hung out, he wouldn't complain about anything other than the fact that the sex would be great.</p> <p>It was still late in the year, but it had gotten pretty late. As an eighteen year old, and as a good-looking boy, he was able to do his share of catching girls. He couldn't keep his hands off a girl for long, but when he caught a chance to catch them in the act like he would tonight, he always found himself sneaking glimpses at some of the older women, so he'd have no problem finding some release as he enjoyed the hell out of it.</p> <p>There was this one girl a couple months prior, who he'd fallen for when she told him that she never knew the difference between being cute and being really attractive. She was a friend to whom Jean Valjaya had a crush, and she was the one that Jean Valjaya would often leave her for as soon as they had sex started. She wasn't very good in the sack, but when it had come to trying to get him to have sex with her, she was what Jean Valjay had in mind.</p> <p>"Come with me," she said, and led the way to her room. It was fairly small, but cozy, and she had a king-his queen sized bed. Jean Valjacks, and the king and king king jacks and he had his king himself and she'd never even his own mattress, but she was a queen's own queen's queen's queen bed and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
