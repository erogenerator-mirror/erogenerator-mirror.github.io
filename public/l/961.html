It had been some time since people could have gone back and re-started the history of America. For a woman living her long and miserable existence in Europe, there, at least to the degree that such an old era existed outside of the pages of a history novel, it still felt like a lifetime ago: an age of nostalgia and hope, a time when we actually could have lived our own life.</p> <p>The same went for some of the other people. The memory made me feel like a young man again, even if it was one that I didn't know how to act around. I just didn't know how to act around, and by any standards I was still a little bit under-dressed to that extent. At least it was for that kind of attention these days.</p> <p>There was just no love or affection for any kind of man—or for the kind of love that was given to all males, which I would never have imagined in the twenty-first century. Of course, that didn't apply to a lot of women.</p> <p>Nevertheless, I could see why the men had the idea of giving a "special" to a woman. Even at a young age, I could appreciate something very attractive when you get down to it. The same was true of any woman.</p> <p>I had been in class for twenty minutes. It was after lunchtime when I finally went over to Mrs. Johnson, the most powerful member of the school's history class. Mrs. Johnson was quite different from the other girls in her class. She had a strong presence and, of course, was a very powerful teacher. She wasn't particularly short or thin, and her class was usually the toughest. She got her students into more trouble than you could ever imagine.</p> <p>I got in a couple of inches behind her, right away. I knew some of her tactics before I did them myself. My first class was usually pretty much in the same shape and tone as hers, with lots of other, less-talented persons getting into it.</p> <p>There were some good times. In the first session, after I caught up with a few of the boys in my class who'd been hanging around to talk to a group of them on the playground a few days earlier, I felt very happy to be sitting on the floor with a few of my favorite friends and listen to their voices for a while. There was some good memories of our youth when we were all together like this: the feel of those people's eyes on me, their hands on me, even the way they kissed and sucked each other to an erotic frenzy. For just a moment at that moment, as I stood next to them trying to decide whether I thought Mrs. Johnson had a hot boyfriend or not, I felt a moment of pure ecstasy: all was right with the world.</p> <p>The good times were almost over when I got up to go to my locker. All the guys were just sitting there, staring at me. I had my legs spread so wide that my panties almost covered all my vagina. I couldn't conceal any of my excitement at being so open and available, though. I felt so very embarrassed in front of the entire class.</p> <p>It was almost 1:00 a.m. and the next class was at 6:00. So I went to the locker room. I left my panties where they were, I had just put them on the line, even though they might have gone to the girl's locker room. I felt very silly and I felt even more self-conscious in that way, knowing that they had gone to make sure I was a good subject for the second half of the class when I got up to leave.</p> <p>On the way out of our school, I went and sat next to Bill, a friend who'd come to my classes with his girlfriend about a year ago. Bill was a really good-looking guy who looked like he had a lot of muscles in it, though he didn't have it.</p> <p>I had a look at Bill when I got in the locker room. What I saw when I went in was a girl with a great body. It really was a body: great, shapely and firm, with big boobs and a round ass and legs. Her skin was tanned and flawless and I just wanted to feel that smooth surface of smooth skin. She had long, straight hair that reached all the way down to her waist. Her blue eyes were a very exotic and attractive feature: a kind of greenish brown.</p> <p>And, as most young men are accustomed to do, her breasts were full, perky and round: natural and full, with those great areolas and, large and a little pink, pink and nipples almost like tiny breasts. Her nipples that lovely full, hard, pink flesh in fact. If they were allure, and seemed only half a pair, with a pink flesh which showed on—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
