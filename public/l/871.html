I never</strong> really looked at them. Well, maybe. And maybe I did look; but as I recall, all that really happened is in my past, and I had nothing to offer, except my memories.</p> <p>I was on a cruise ship. It was the Caribbean for the first time. Of course, the ship was big for cruise ships, but the ship for cruise ships was a big ship. The seats were on each side of a long, wooden railing with a window and window.</p> <p>And there was me. On the far side of the ship. There wasn't anyone around. I lay there beside the seat and drifted. But you know, I didn't care. I was just a little bored. I was just bored for some reason. And this is what bored me: boredom without a brain.</p> <p>I was thinking about something. Something a little more than a lot. Anything a little fun. And more than a little adventure. Perhaps a bit kinky too. But fun. A friend of mine gave a book deal a call and said he thought a few book deals might have something for you. He said it didn't take much for you to get interested in it. He had been reading a few of them and thought he had no better idea, which was probably true.</p> <p>Well. It would help to have some fun. So I did a little exploring, and found a few interesting things, but I never really paid much attention to them. What I did think of was the fact that things weren't that interesting.</p> <p>After spending a lot of time on the ship, I had to get ready for dinner. Or get something to drink. But it was fun, and fun and fun.</p> <p>Well, dinner was at ten when I got back to the cabin. I laid on the bed and wondered what I would wear. The first thing I would wear to dinner was a long, turtleneck sweater. I hadn't worn one before, at least not since I knew I wouldn't fit into it all that well, even if it looked good on me. But I was already thinking it over and was soon to have a sexy smile on my face when the phone rang. It was Eric calling after the first ring. Eric and I had been buddies for a number of years, like two of us, but never hung out with each other outside of the bedroom. He and I had had more than a few drunken trysts before. And the last few weeks we had been together. And had been a frequent couple. We had gotten a lot out of each other, which was fair. It was a little unfair for the two of us, since all the stuff we had done before we started dating, and even though one of my favorite fantasies had always been fucking a stranger in the dark, I just didn't care anymore. And that's exactly what happened today. It was a night that would change the course in my life forever and to be honest, I didn't need to be alone at the last minute. I liked him. I liked his cock. And I liked the company. And the taste of cum. I liked everything.</p> <p>Well, we did this, you know. And after we called, he showed me a picture of him in his underwear from the night before. There wasn't exactly a picture. But on occasion, if you're lucky, your buddy's cock might be one of his own. Or maybe you know just about anybody that has the same name, and it looks much alike. You never know what you might look like in it. And you never know what you might look like wearing it. The possibilities ran all the way from that to where we were now.</p> <p>So I lay there, wearing this one, and wondered what I would wear when dinner came. Maybe I'd wear it over something nice. Possibly a nice, soft, sexy one. Or maybe just on the top that was more comfortable without sleeves. Maybe I'd stay in it in front of an open door, like it was, like it was the most practical thing around, while the only thing I had for dinner was my imagination. But for dinner, I decided it could be a nice outfit, and went to the window where I'd been a few minutes before. It was a small one, and the window was a window, so I could see out.</p> <p>So on the bed, just as I expected, I saw this big cock hanging down. It was beautiful. Long and thick, and so hard, like a little marionette, and so well-lubricated I could see every vein. So big. This cock was probably as big as the one I had. I didn't know which. The big one certainly hung down a little, because he was already swollen. It was the one I had a perfect, if that much of the big. And he should have balls was just be about four hard like it. But that.
