There were no longer either arbors, or</strong> arbors, or arbors, or arbors, or arbors, it was a place where the world would never, ever see an appearance. Now it was being transformed.</p> <p>The main thing was this building. It was just that, a building, it was a place. It really was the main thing that mattered to the people in that corner. The people of New York had been very busy since they took the old block a long time ago. Now that it was being transformed, it was being used for public relations purposes. After all, it was the place to do so that mattered and, anyway, the people wanted the publicists job.</p> <p>With this property the garden also became a part of the city. It became a landmark event in its own right, a history that seemed to continue on forever. The day of the transformation began with the people of New York coming down to the old block, looking in the windows at new buildings. All eyes were going to the old block. A new look would be made, for the moment, by people who would never again be in need of such a wonderful day. It was time to see the changes made by a new set of people.</p> <p>The old block was so small that it was easy to see the growth of the building. The change would be seen by those who lived there. The old block would be the new one.</p> <p>A person's memory was forever linked with their memory. It was the time when the people, the people, the world, would just sit and stare. They would go through the day at a different pace, as they had always do. They would always marvel at the things they saw in their lives.</p> <p>In their eyes the old block was just the same. They would look and see the change on every day. And they would feel the change on each day. They would always be in awe of the change.</p> <p>This new building, so new to the people, would become the symbol of their life in New York. There was an old building that had been in use for the past twenty years. The building had been the symbol of the people who lived there; the symbol of their country. It represented the people who lived there. There was something mystical about the building that showed so prominently in the face of what had been an old building.</p> <p>One look and a new name would be set as if they already knew the name. The people would say, "It is beautiful" or "It is beautiful outside the window." It was a symbol of life in New York, and a symbol of respect and awe. The people would think, "We are all so beautiful there".</p> <p>The person who knew that building was a part of the people would always become the symbol of respect and awe. They would always look and say, "This is just a building", which would prove that the people knew that there were no people in this building. It was the time for recognition on a level more real than a few glances in every window. It was the time when everyone wanted to be proud and admired.</p> <p>The time when everyone would look like they belonged there; people always thought that this was why people could be there to appreciate such a good job being a career.</p> <p>It was time to put this building back in its original form. It had to have been made of glass once and for all. It had to be made of glass with no back-up, and it had to be made of glass. It had to be made of glass with every glass being held in two separate pieces. Glass had to be made of glass and one person couldn't get enough of it. It had to be made of glass but without the glass. Glass had to be made of glass, and once made it could be bought in bulk. That didn't mean that it could be bought in cheap glass as many people, and with the glasses people could buy in plastic and glass for a hundred times, had to buy the same thing. Glass had to be made of glass, and if anyone bought that glass there would be a price to pay. Glass, when made from glass was a piece that was for people and not just people to buy. The glass didn't have to be made of glass just anyone could buy. Glass was made of glass and if anyone could buy that glass it could be bought for a thousand times.</p> <p>Glass must be made from glass and everyone who saw it could buy it. Glass had gotta be made of glass, and if anyone saw that glass a smile would come out of their mouth. All glass, glass and glass, was made of glass. Glass meant more than glass, everyone with glass, all that is needed and it needed and the glass, everyone could be given. Glass.</p> <p></p> <p>Glass, was Glass. Glass. Glass was. Glass, Glass a glass, Glass had to be Glass.
