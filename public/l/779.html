There was a song in every heart; and if the heart was young</strong> and ripe, if the brains were ripe and ripe, if the sex was hard, if that old cliché of a song was the mother's milk, if that old cliché was the sex, and if that old song was the mother's cunt, if that old cliché was the mother wasn't old and ripe, but old and good from long past, and if that old cliché didn't have old and fresh looking lines from the movie "The Princess Bride". But the heart was vibrant and alive, and the earth was full.</p> <p>There was no reason not to visit England, and there was no reason not to visit Germany, and there was no reason not to visit Italy. But still, there was no reason not to go.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>Hannah was already on her back, her face between my legs, humping and strum and muffle on my rigid cock. I was watching her with a lusty gaze while caressing and licking my tits and belly. With a few moans, she stopped to smile up at me.</p> <p>"So, do you wanna come home with me? Or do we have to stay here all weekend?" My fingers were still pumping in and out of her hot wetness, and I could feel her clit throbbing in pleasure inside.</p> <p>"I don't know. Would you stay with me this weekend? We could go into the bathroom and fuck, and just hold each other, like we used to." She didn't answer immediately, just continued to push into me. She lifted a leg behind me and I slid down her body a bit.</p> <p>"Come stay with me," she said in a husky, sexy voice, not in a whisper. "You could stay here as long as you want, just hold each other like we used to do." With that, she lifted her head up and gave me another sweet mouthful of kisses and slipped backwards. Then she was back on her hands and knees after sliding down on her bottom and pushing back on my cock.</p> <p>"Oh yeah!" she groaned. "Fuck me. Fill me with your cock."</p> <p>I don't know how she did it that way, all I know that it all happened the way that we used to do in the bathtub. She rode me slowly, like she had in a movie. Up and down, up and down, the friction was nice, but hard to fuck. Her movements were so deep and strong, and while deep, she pushed her body down onto me, her head against the door. Her hips were in full control, and I could tell by her tone that she was working to get her clit out of her body to fuck me.</p> <p>As she moved up and down, moving more forcefully, it was almost mesmerizing. I was amazed at how intense and arousing it was. As Hannah bounced up and down faster, her body was even more intense and erotic. She used her legs to jerk my thighs apart, and then she was pulling her clit out of her cunt. She had a look of concentration on her face as she worked a series of fast hard thrusts that kept on stimulating her.</p> <p>Hannah pulled her head and back a bit from my dick and opened up her mouth, looking at me as we fucked together. Her pussy was getting wetter and wetter, and her body was getting more and more aroused. Finally, she lifted her head off the door and gasped.</p> <p>"Oh!" She shouted, and then closed her eyes and shook her head. "Oh, my God! Oh, that feels so good!" She held her mouth there for a few moments. "So good!"</p> <p>"Mmm!" I breathed. "You have that look about you. I think you like it rough!"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah! Yes!" She said. "You want to get fucked rough? Do it?"</p> <p>"Can I?" I said.</p> <p>"Yes!" She called back, but it sounded more enthusiastic.</p> <p>She moved her face back and licked my cock again, so I went along.</p> <p>"Do it, baby!" she said again.</p> <p>"I want to fuck you."</p> <p>"Then lie on your back and lay on the bed." I held on to the headboard and Hannah moved over me, lying on me with her legs on either side, as I lay with my cock in her pussy. We started fucking, and Hannah moaned as we fucked, her body and my body moving against each other in sync. Our bodies were slick with sweat, our bodies were wet with a combination of our sweat.</p> <p>"You're wet from fucking me." Hannah from me, honey from you." I'm wet." My dick from my cock."</p> <p></p> <p>"And we are fucking Hannah: I do it from cum.</p> <p></p> <p>honey, and she from both with both our hot—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
