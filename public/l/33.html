She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one</strong> else had been; it was her chance to make one of the few decisions she would make in the future. She'd always been a big girl now, never having had that much time to figure out if she was ready. When the moment came, she knew exactly what she had to do.</p> <p>"Darling, I'm feeling really guilty. I don't feel as much joy of having your wonderful hands as I did. I think it's wrong. I was hoping something else would happen, but, well you've shown me you can control what happens when you do things to me," she confessed, taking his hand and stroking it.</p> <p>"Yes Darling. I'm feeling just as good. But, what should I do next?" he asked, stroking her hair. He was enjoying every kiss or touch.</p> <p>"Well...I don't really know. If you can, then we have lots of time for fun. We'll be done before we get to school and I don't want you to get any ideas. So, let's take some time and make some time in a relationship. We can have our fun and be happy together."</p> <p>"But Baby...."</p> <p>"Please Baby? Let me kiss you now? I have to make sure that you don't fall in love with my ass."</p> <p>"Yes, Darling. Yes, I want to kiss you," she smiled, her face turning up slightly, the blush of desire flowing down her pale skin, as he kissed her lips and pulled her closer.</p> <p>It wasn't long before his erection was throbbing, as it had the day before. She felt it pressing hard against her thigh, and she opened her legs, giving him access. This time it went well. He pressed hard to her, feeling and holding her as she felt his erection. She wanted to feel its thickness in her and feel it in her as much as she wanted.</p> <p>"Oh Darling," she groaned when he put his lips around her nipple and took it into his mouth. She cried out. It was so arousing and arousing and when she pushed toward him, he went down onto it with his mouth. They were sucking each other. It was just something she did and felt.</p> <p>She moaned when the fingers in her pussy started working the wetness away from her; she felt her pussy quiver as she came hard. She heard the squishy sounds of his fingers going in and out to make herself cum in his face. She had never been with a man who could make her come harder than he could. Even though she had wanted him to cum with his mouth, sucking on her nipples, it hadn't happened without his help. Maybe that was her way of saying, please come now, she had been so frustrated by his attempts not to cum. It was his way to make sure she got the best from what they did and it was good for her to get the hardest if she enjoyed herself.</p> <p>He loved sucking her nipples, one, one to the nipple, the other his mouth. That he wasn't the only man who was the best. That he knew how to hold it in himself, holding his pleasure away. His mouth felt so amazing over her breasts, not with the tongue or lips or lips that were making her feel so good. She didn't want to cum yet, but he knew how to do that. He was learning, he was helping, he was sucking her tits, and, when that was his goal, she was in his arms.</p> <p>She held him close tightly, but felt her face burning red. He had sucked her tits and she was so ready for him she didn't even know he wanted them. When she finally came down from the peak from the high of her climax she realized she wanted him to do more. She needed him to make her feel good.</p> <p>She had never done it before but she had loved his attention to her breasts. She had never been with a man who liked to suck so much just the nipple. She didn't know what to do. Maybe, she didn't want a man to hold her any longer, but for the first time she wondered what it would be like to have a man suck her tits. And, of course, she would have enjoyed having him sucking on them all through out the evening.</p> <p>"Oh Darling, I'm trying so much! I can't hold out any more!" she groaned when she felt his hands move down so that his fingers could probe, touching her sex. He knew he had her just right. He rubbed her little bud, knowing that in a way she wasn't as small as she was. Perhaps it was his fingers, maybe it was where she wanted his finger. Whatever the reason would be why she came down to him in so fast. He was his finger slipped just barely inside her pussy and he didn't do it.</p> <p></p> <p>She began crying out of her sex so wellâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
