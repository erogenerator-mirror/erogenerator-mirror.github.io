It was a nice sickly season just at this time. In commercial phrase, coffins were looking up; and, in the course of</strong> the last few days Oliver had gotten into some serious arguments about what was wrong with him. He wanted to say one thing about it, and then he knew, as soon as he did, and that was about the most important thing that was right between his neck and neck because, if anybody asked him, he was gay and didn't wanna suck dick; then he'd say it. Which he damn sure would have worked out pretty much in his favor. But, the fact is, he didn't have a clue about it yet, so, he hadn't.</p> <p>Because, well, it was a Saturday. It meant, it was time to go to bed. So it was nice to try a little change to the routine, to loosen up for the evening's activities.</p> <p>But, as soon as he got in bed, he got worried. He couldn't keep his dick from being hard. Even he couldn't avoid it. The thing he needed to do was get a move on, a change in my routine to make it easier. He needed to change the way I saw the world and what I felt; to become the person that I think I am.</p> <p>So, he turned off all the lights, made himself comfortable, and got into bed, with his dick fully hard and straight as a rock. His body didn't quiver, nor did he shiver as he stretched out his legs. It didn't look as good as it did last Friday's, though it sure was the best part of the date. Oh, and that's when she gave him her number.</p> <p>Oliver was so happy. He'd been lucky enough last week to get a kiss on each of his cheeks, and he'd never received one yet, so he'd been so happy on his own. His mind was full of a million emotions. But, even if he didn't say it out loud, he realized he didn't have one of those 'I love you, Oliver' expressions. It was like something he was never gonna say out loud, because if his dick didn't have a 'haha' expression, it wouldn't say out loud.</p> <p>So, right before he flipped to sleep, he picked up his phone and dialed the number to her apartment.</p> <p>"Hello?"</p> <p>"Oliver?"</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"Is this Oliver?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Oh, that's so sexy, sweetie. I'm so happy for you, sweetie. I wish you were my girlfriend so I could always call you my little girlfriend. I was kinda worried I'd just be on the other end of this line ringing in the middle of the night. So, sweetie, you have anything you'd like to say?"</p> <p>"I was thinking," he said.</p> <p>"Yes. I was thinking how bad I need a good fucking, that I've already decided that if I let you do me now, I'd agree to suck your dick. So, sweetie, I agree to do you now, but, when you give me that blowjob you promised, I want to suck yours. If, when you're done sucking your boyfriend's dick, you want me to fuck you, you need to come to me. If, when you fuck me, you want to eat my pussy, you come to me. Do you understand?"</p> <p>"I agree to that."</p> <p>"If you say so, Oliver, please fuck me now. When I'm with you, please do me now. And make me come. Please. I need it so badly."</p> <p>"So, where are we?"</p> <p>"Right here. Now, just make yourself come, okay?" Oliver wanted to be able to make her call. "I'll be there in like, five minutes."</p> <p>"Yeah, that'll be great, baby." He couldn't wait.</p> <p>"Great." He couldn't wait either. He thought, if he fucked her, he'd get a blowjob. But, after all the sex last night, he couldn't wait any longer.</p> <p>"Okay, Oliver, I'm about out, so I guess it's time I made myself come."</p> <p>To his surprise, "So, Oliver, are you still on-line?"</p> <p>"No, sweetie. I don't have any porn on my phone yet. It's time for me to upload onto that porn site."</p> <p>"How about, in person, Oliver?"</p> <p>"Yeah." Oliver's heart skipped a beat. "I can do that."</p> <p>"Good, now I want you to get down for me on-line. Okay, Oliver?" - . I want- okay, you put- Okay- Okay! Go." Oliver- Go! Do- Go on- Oh, come to come?" . "Okay, come- coming- there- Okay- Okay.
