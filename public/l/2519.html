You've been so much on the menu; the whole of it has been a riddle. You're a fucking mess of a man, with a fucking penis, and a fucking brain. The problem can only be resolved by getting away from the topic for a bit, where its focus is on your present state; a bit like I was doing.</p> <p>Well, maybe it has only been the matter; so let's set aside the subject. So, the question now is..., what are we in our present state of mind?</p> <p>"It's in my vagina," Isa said. "I am not a virgin. I want you all to do this thing, and you are my first. I want you to make babies."</p> <p>I moved to my knees between her thighs. "It's not a bad thing--its just in my mouth," I said. I kissed her on the lips. "I don't do this often, because it's not right, but that's ok for you."</p> <p>Isa nodded in anticipation. "I'll get this," she said. With that, she placed my cock in the warmth of her lips, pressing it to her face. She closed her eyes and opened them, and I felt her lips part, and the warmth of her breath. Her chin moved, and pressed onto me. She began to pump my cock in and out in her face, running my head, her lips along a couple of inches. I was loving it. This was exactly the thing which had attracted me to her after all. I looked down with satisfaction.</p> <p>One of her hands came to join the other on my chest. "Fuck me," she said, "fuck me hard. Oh yes, right there. Fuck me with your big cock, and pump it into me. I want it. I want to feel it. Fuck me."</p> <p>The words were obscene and obscene, as were the sounds of pleasure. I slid my cock into the warmness and warmth of her. She wrapped her legs around me and hugged me tightly as we thrust. I felt the warmth of her body with every stroke, the sensation of her breath on mine. This was the purest of pleasures. My cock went deeper into her as I stroked her. Her hair, the back of her neck, all enveloped me while we kissed. We held each other tightly as the tension ebbed. My heart was beating. We stayed in that moment for a long moment, enjoying the intimate connection. At last we began our mutual rhythm. Each stroke was a slow advance; every second, second. We kissed with such an intimacy that could only be described as erotic.</p> <p>I was not surprised. I had done it often enough to realize I wanted it to last as long as it had. After all, I was the man of our marriage, after all.</p> <p>With all that in mind, I began to slow my strokes. I was aware of my cock pushing into Isa's face. It felt good. I felt her mouth on it. I felt something else entirely. I felt warmness. I felt...familiar. It felt like I was with an angel. I felt the heat from her face when I stopped. I looked down on her. She was lying on her stomach. She was pulling our cocks together, sucking them. I felt so free, so free. I could not tell you. All I could tell was in my mind's eye is that I wanted this. I wanted to feel it. Feel myself going further and further from my current state. I began to feel that all of this was real, as if we were connected somehow. I wanted to give her something that she could never ask for.</p> <p>My body was aflame with desire. I began to push into her harder and deeper, feeling her hands on my ass as I did. I kissed her belly and breasts. I felt her body go up and down. Then there was pressure. She seemed to have a body that I couldn't feel. She was moving my cock in and out. The feeling was incredible. I felt myself going faster. Then I felt it. The wet heat of her pussy was as a fountain of wetness. I felt her hands on my ass. Then I felt the warm fluid moving into me. I knew it was like a waterfall I needed to feel my own orgasm. I felt the wetness of her body as she came. I felt the hot sensation as I came. I could hear a voice in my head telling me to not finish. I saw the eyes of her sex, I saw the soft brown hair hanging down, and I saw that she had cum in my mouth. It felt as though I had just cum in her. I did. I had loved the sensation of that.</p> <p></p> <p>I was about to make love myself. I was my beloved. I was to make my love the sensation of having a warm love theâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
