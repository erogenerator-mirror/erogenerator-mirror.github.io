What are your plans for today young man?’</p> <p>’My day off is next week and tomorrow is next Thursday and the afternoon I think that my wife would like to accompany her friend for a night or two.</p> <p>Her smile grew from her face, as she said, ‘I'm looking forward to it.’</p> <p>She kissed him and added ‘I'd love to have you for my own.’</p> <p>With that she left for her room. As she undid her blouse she asked if he would like the job of having the sex.</p> <p>Her words had made him hard already. He said he'd be happy to help she remove her clothes.</p> <p>She stepped out of the white gown that came with her and she unbuttoned her pleated pants slowly as she let the trousers slide to the ground. She could feel her pussy moistening with anticipation. She didn't feel too shy about the sex with her husband when she stood before him in just her bra and panties, and as he watched she began to run her hands over her belly and thighs. He leaned over and kissed her as she let her fingers brush the back of her panties and gently caressed her lips. She slid her finger inside herself and began to circle her clitoris, then her nipples. They hardened on their own as he leaned over to her. She knew she would let him do anything he wanted with her, right this moment.</p> <p>He sat down on a sofa in the middle of the room. She stood there with her hands behind her head with a beautiful smile on her face. Her nipples were hard already. Her pubic hair was almost the same as her legs. Her waist was trim in all that it did to her, even though her bottom was still slim. There was something about her body that made her just so irresistible to him.</p> <p>The way she danced, toying with her breasts while he watched was one he wanted to have all over again. She turned slowly and walked towards him. Her hands began to caress her own sides. As she got closer to him she took the rest of her clothes off slowly and sensually in the process. She stood there on the edge of his sofa as he looked at her every move.</p> <p>She looked at him and said ‘do you want to taste me? Here, let me help you.'</p> <p>‘Oh God', was all he could say as she unzipped his trousers and let her hands run over his bulging flesh. He was already hard and she felt her wetness increase as her hands traced his length with long fingers. She looked into his eyes, and she wanted to kiss him, to kiss him so that he could take her to the next level of passion.</p> <p>She slid her hand down over her belly and reached her clitoris with her finger. She was wet from watching herself.</p> <p>She said very quietly, ‘Ohh, I like when you do that, it makes me so wet.’</p> <p>He could only nod in assent because his cock was throbbing almost painfully, at last.</p> <p>She slid him inside her once more. They kissed at the edge of the sofa. She sat down next to him. She reached down and took his hand as they kissed for the first time. She pulled her panties down slowly to her ankles and she moved her legs apart while she reached down and cupped his balls in her hand. They were heavy and round and she played in them with her finger, tracing the shape and texture with her touch. Her husband was feeling rather than seeing her in all her other nude glory, her tits out like a ball and her face between them, and looking at the expression of his face.</p> <p>‘I like when you look at me all the time. You look like you want to do this with me, or even in me right here.’</p> <p>’I don't know if this is wise or good for my marriage’s stability, but it feels so right,’ he replied with a smile.</p> <p>She got up on the end of the sofa where they both sat. Her mouth came down onto his cock where his head disappeared into her mouth. She felt his body stiffen and his cock seemed to be swelling to full hardness within a fraction of the time she was sucking him. His hands went to the back of her head and ran through her soft hair as he began to fuck her mouth. His hands touched her cheek and he kissed her deeply and passionately for the first time as his own mouth devoured hers, one-by-one.</p> <p>‘God’ he thought, I never got any better looking at her than right now, when she was in her own body was fully nude and a man. is so sexy. She was the only seen from his eyes alone and in herself, her own, yet his face as he stared at—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
