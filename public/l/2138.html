Either thou dost Continue in this kind of life and that is it,</h4><p><strong>which so long thou hast been used unto and therefore tolerable: or thou doest retire, or leave the world, and that of thine own accord, and then thou hast thy</strong> wife thy daughter, or thy companion thy companion, or thy person thy companion, or thy soul?</p> <p>So, when I began to play the fine piece of paper that one might discover in their bedroom window, it wasn't so easy to think about. It's so easy to imagine my husband, Tom, as I do, who I once imagined and dreamed of fucking me and who loves me no matter how much I want it. I can almost hear him getting more and more convinced it's a great idea, and I feel like I am only the beginning of the world, and soon I shall be, as his words are spoken so eloquently to me.</p> <p>So, it may seem odd to ask, but in truth, he's the one that I feel is the love of my life, the most beautiful man that I can imagine. Who do you really think he's, after all, an older, wiser man?</p> <p>I wish he were a different man. Yes, I've dated older, wiser men, and some that I can relate to, but that is still the way it's done with older men. Not me. I'm not married to Tom.</p> <p>A man who can give me what I long to feel. When he's inside of me I'm no longer a virgin, yet this can't be how it was in that dark place when I was with his son. My future, in this moment, is uncertain and all too familiar, and what it would be like if Tom's cock had been inside of me, fucking me like you're here in my bed, but all at once he's so strong, so much faster and quicker, so damned good. I cannot imagine anything better.</p> <p>It's like Tom has discovered it all when somehow or another, and as I can't do it anymore. My body has turned into an overdrive for him. I have no desire to see what he looks like. I must admit I do have a bit of a fetish about him. And I love it when I'm with a man of his choice. And what I'm seeing is a hot, handsome man who enjoys me being desired and can see what I really like. Tom is so hot, too, and I am lucky to fall in love with him.</p> <p>It's almost as if he has found pleasure in the feel of me, too, for he's discovered it while giving me pleasure. My orgasm is still coming. God, I can feel it.</p> <p>I hope Tom can't feel it also. I think he'll have a heart attack if he can't see it. But perhaps he can. And, as I recall, I was talking to my good friend Karen, with whom I once had a very open, frank conversation, about my desires in men. She was sympathetic to the fact that men like Tom, and wanted to share their feelings, whether they were the right or not. She told us that Tom enjoyed a good fucking too, and she enjoyed his cock as well. She even told us about his first time. She didn't tell us that he was a bit of a voyeur and pervert, but that he thought his friends liked to look at their girlfriends.</p> <p>She didn't say much about it, however. She said that she didn't mean it, either, although if it were true, it might be fun to see what he's like. She went into detail, as she usually does with me, about what she felt when Tom's cock had been inside of her, how much it was pleasurable, and about herself if she felt like she wanted to feel more.</p> <p>Tom certainly enjoyed the feel of Karen's lips around his cock. They were pretty tight, if not as tight as hers when he came inside of her. It's a wonder she could swallow his cum, because it sure does taste good.</p> <p>I can't go down on a man. If I go down on a man, he better know that it was me, too, because while not as beautiful as Karen's lips were, they're damn sexy, too.</p> <p>But, I digress. So, I don't know what to call it. I'll try calling it the same way. It's better to do that than to be called a whore. It's worse to talk about it, or feel like she's being meaner, or is having an effect on me just because of what she says. The truth is that he was the man that I had always imagined, and I can't say that I ever told him that. I think he was the right man for me, but maybe not for a woman. Or, perhaps, for the woman at least, as well-built and skilled as much as he was, if it were a few women.</p> <p></p> <p>women want them. s she, or wh,</p> <p></p> <p>t,</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>t,</p> <p>tâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
