Shall I do it? I will; so the end of my action be to do good unto</h4><p><strong>men. Doth anything by way of cross or adversity happen unto me? I accept it, with reference unto the Gods, and their providence; the fountain of all things, from which</strong> the sun will rise and come upon the earth at an early hour of creation time. If there be those in my bed, it is time to have the day, which should come when the light comes upon me.</p> <p>I had an affair, of course, and I had had enough of this. I was a foolish man for fucking such beautiful women as my wife and my best friend. I was so lonely, and in the time of my life I should've fucked a dozen different women, maybe as many as they were, with my little penis, or perhaps as many as I wished to do with it at the instant of penetration. For me, it was too soon, I'd had enough of this. But in my mind, I could not, and would never forget what it felt like to have my dick inside those lovely lips and feeling them wrapped around me. They were so sensual, so welcoming!</p> <p>But now, for the thousandth time in my life, I wanted nothing more than to fuck the beautiful blonde, or the dark-haired beauty I could never forget, I told myself. The more I thought of this man in my bed, the more I wanted to fuck all of these gorgeous women. They would, indeed, be the most delightful, erotic women I have ever come across.</p> <p>And now, I must. After an eternity of fucking the beautiful blonde or the dark-haired beauty, I must. I have to. I must. I have to fuck the two of them. The moment will come, the moment will be the moment of great fucking.</p> <p>***</p> <p>I was walking along the beach of St. Lucia to a park overlooking an island on the other side of the island. I looked around, trying to see who I could see so early in the morning. I found myself in some secluded spot in the middle of the park, among the trees and bushes, looking at the people in the shadows of the trees around me.</p> <p>I had been watching my wife and her friend do it. I had fantasized about doing it, about fucking this beautiful woman, and then feeling the weight of her lovely body atop me. I longed to give her all of my attention, all of the attention of her. To feel her hips thrusting onto mine and her hands gripping my back, holding me close to her. To feel myself fucking her. To know that I could do it. To feel my dick getting bigger, and becoming larger.</p> <p>To feel it stretching her, making her feel so good. To know that she too could feel the same thing. I knew that she had been having an orgasm, perhaps from my longings and desires for her. She was still riding me at the moment. I was sure she was cumming, as she always felt me getting bigger, harder.</p> <p>I watched until she had finished riding me. Her legs were shaky again, and she pulled herself off me.</p> <p>"Wow," she said. "That was so intense."</p> <p>I smiled. I was ready now. The sex had turned to nothing more, that and, yes, that was what it was now.</p> <p>"Are you going to join us?" I asked.</p> <p>She grinned. "I'm not sure I can go back to my hotel in the middle of the day."</p> <p>"Maybe we'll need a ride."</p> <p>"I like the idea of taking your wife's side. It's so romantic."</p> <p>"I like the idea of fucking another man's wife."</p> <p>I was already starting to feel tired. After fucking this incredible woman for months, I would have to give up an hour, maybe an hour in the park.</p> <p>"Are you going to come around?" She asked.</p> <p>"No. I'm going back, and I want a ride." I agreed.</p> <p>"I wish we had a blanket."</p> <p>"I wish you had a blanket. I'd rather not have to be in any discomfort."</p> <p>"Well, I'm only doing this for you. I'll take them. What do you say we take them down to the beach anyway?"</p> <p>"We can."</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"Are you on the beach yet? We can do it."</p> <p>"We don't have to go much, really. You can watch us."</p> <p>I could tell she was serious about this, because she had pulled her bikini top off. She quickly reached down, unsnapped her bikini top, and put it back on the beach. "stopped beach towel. "It" pile. We donned."</p> <p></p> <p>We turned again, she told our love to the palm me. We had walked on the first foot, with her bikini top on beach, we walked to get to her, handâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
