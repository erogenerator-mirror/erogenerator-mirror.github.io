[Gwendolen and Cecily are at the window, looking out into the garden.] Gwendolen. The fact that they did not follow us at once into the</strong> garden was a huge clue. The idea of fucking their neighbor at night as soon as we got in the car probably wouldn't have been anything new. The drive didn't really work as planned. When we arrived at the Manor House it was at least a thirty-five minute drive to the house. We would have had a problem if we had gone into the house and left the two women alone, and even if we'd done they weren't going to do anything we didn't want them to. So, once we got inside they'd be too busy fucking their neighbor to even care. That was our plan.</p> <p>Once inside our house, we would go straight to the bedroom where our plan was going.</p> <p>----------</p> <p>As Gwendolen and Cecily went downstairs to take some ice off their drinks, the housekeeper had one of her famous surprises on her conscience.</p> <p>"Hurry up!" she told them. "We still have more of our afternoon's work to do. You boys should come too."</p> <p>With that she and Gwendolen took one more sip of their champagne, all the while exchanging pleasantries and joking and giggling with us.</p> <p>"Well," the woman said, "maybe we should just take our time and finish what we started already."</p> <p>When the maid took the glass of champagne from the woman's hand, she said, "But if we hurry, this is our only moment. First, we can't get to know each other for quite some time." Then she motioned us over with the back of her hand. "Why don't you two go downstairs and give your hair a comb."</p> <p>We didn't take our time, and even though we all had our hair pulled into a very casual approximation of a military military style, we just went downstairs where we would stand in front of the fireplace with Gwendolen.</p> <p>At that point Gwendolen was already behind Cecily, pulling her off of me, and was kissing the neck of her long, dark hair behind her head. It was so nice to feel her hot, naked body against mine and to feel that familiar hardness I had gotten just a short while before.</p> <p>"Gwendolen," Cecily said before kissing my ear. "I have to tell you something. The time is up. There's nothing to hide. And I want something to do to your body that I'll be very jealous of."</p> <p>Cecily's kisses were getting more and more insistent against my ear and neck, and before long she could feel my cock, which stiffened more in response to her hot breath. So, instead of leaving my ear and neck alone, she was kissing it all the way down where it curved towards the end so close to where you couldn't see the sides of the two sets of eyes that were locked on our faces.</p> <p>Cecily pushed my pants and underpants down to my knees, and then she knelt once again to take off my shoes and socks. Cecily's tongue slid down over my bare feet, teasing the underside as she dragged it all around the insides of each of my toes, and as she worked it up to the next toe and repeated this several times, the way my husband never did, he just tickled, and it was enough to send me back to a little daze where only I could come. At that very moment, Cecily's tongue flicked my left foot, and every muscle in my body tensed in the way to push her tongue deeper into me, until she was literally devouring me.</p> <p>Cecily's kisses and licking weren't just licking, and my skin began to heat up even more when she stopped to tease in between my toes where I could still feel it, and then took them in her mouth. It wasn't every day that I got a good licking of my toes and foot. Maybe it was different to have my foot sucked and licked right after you had fucked your wife's pussy, or a different time to have someone have two cunts and get one of them. Either way, the sensation of Cecily's warm mouth on my feet was even better.</p> <p>I had completely lost track of time when I first felt Cecily's hands move up my bare legs. She had been stroking my cock ever since it had been released. Before long, I was lying on the carpet with several of my toes in her warm mouth, when her head went from my left foot to my right. Her hands stayed there, and before long she was going for my balls, which were quite a bit bigger than usual. All those hands felt so good caressing me just when I needed to be touched the most. Her fingers and tongue were working their magic, and kissing each other body's, while they had their fingers and tongues went back and forth between each other's legs.</p> <p>While I held on my left, it I was kneeling, the foot was on my mouthâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
