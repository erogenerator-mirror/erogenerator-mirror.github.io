KISSES FOR BLOWS.</h4><p><strong>When Pierre Gringoire arrived on the Place de Grève, he was paralyzed. He had directed his course across the Pont aux Meuniers, in order to avoid the rabble on the</strong> Place de Plasmier. However, it was impossible. He had been too paralyzed by their demands on him. The only thing that had prepared him to have sex with a woman was a man, a young man. Pierre's mind was in a different place; he was scared - afraid that when he saw his wife, he'd fall hopelessly in love with her. That fear, he realized, was because every girl he'd ever seen had turned him down and had turned him into a closet exhibitionist. He'd been in such a state that his entire life had been an act. But in those last days, he hadn't been able to escape the fear and terror. And by the time he fell in love with his wife, he'd be in love with every one of them in the world. But in that moment, he couldn't resist. Even if he didn't get a woman, after they had sex, he'd give them exactly what they wanted. And if they gave him sex, he wanted to reciprocate what they gave him.</p> <p>Pierre's first lesson was to learn his lesson. He'd read about bondage, and he remembered reading some book that said it was safe to tie oneself up to the ceiling and blindfolded. He knew that he was not ready to go all the way. He looked toward his bed as if he was ready to say something, but a part of him had made a mistake. He had to keep telling himself the lesson. And by this time, he was in a bit of a daze. He couldn't believe how it was for him. He had to teach himself to be completely relaxed. He should tell himself this and never to make mistakes. And that's what he had to do. To teach him the art of BDSM. As he was looking at his bed, the daze seemed to diminish. The room became more and more warm and peaceful.</p> <p>Pierre was startled when an arm reached out and slowly caressed his cock. At first, it felt as if it went through his legs, caressing his balls and his ass, but after a while, it felt more like a hand. He realized that it started to excite him. So it became a handjob. It started to excite him. The hand started to squeeze the underside at the base. It got to the end of his cock and then wrapped around its entire length, leaving just the head in the palm of the hand. It felt like his cock was inside the hand. It felt like his cock had gone through the palm of a hand. And it felt as if it were rubbing against the end of his cock and squeezing it.</p> <p>It made his heart pound. It made him tremble. He could not get enough of his dick being stroked. It was like a long, hot rope of saliva was going down his shaft and into the open cavity in his underpants. It seemed like it wanted to go straight to its owner mouth or to his ass. To get into his mouth, to cum in it. It wasn't moving though. He was scared to think that it might go everywhere. But suddenly, he realized that it could. It just needed to get past all of its restrictions and it could be done. So every time it was touched, its touches became more and more intense. And all the girls around him had been watching. And they had each had a hand on his cock. They had each been stroking it. They had each been tugging it. On purpose, they had wanted to give his cock the most intense sexual stimulation it could ever imagine. They had each had a part of the shaft in their hand and all of it was being manipulated. And it wasn't a finger, it was a hand. The women surrounding him wanted to squeeze and pull it. They wanted to see it get hard. They wanted to see the look on his face. If he would just suck on it a little bit longer, it might go further.</p> <p>The hand stroking his cock seemed like it wanted to just get off his tongue and then it would slowly pull it all the way off. But that felt as if it were a piston, a machine. And it didn't want to stop. It wanted to be stroked ever more forcefully. It wanted to rub at the tip of his cock and then push it to the back of his throat. It wanted to suck on it a little bit longer. Then it would slowly and finally slip it out of his mouth and put it back in. It wanted to kiss him a little bit, to suck on his lips, to kiss, to eat his mouth. It wanted to make love to him.</p> <p>It wanted to fuck. And it wanted to take what had been done to him. It. Pierre felt that it wanted to want.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>His cock, it was a girl's prick-was, it, it was,it couldn't, wasn't, not. Yes it, was, it—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
