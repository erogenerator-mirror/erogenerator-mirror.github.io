Tell me, O Muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after he had sacked</strong> that stupid thing, what has become the world's greatest fuck. The man has no clue who's really fucking him on the first ring finger he uses to write and in his mind has no idea where he has gotten a hard on. But in his mind is is that man. And that bastard was born on the first ring finger! And that was why he was born on the first ring finger, because that's what the great man is! That man is the son he's just discovered who has got him so hard, as far as he knows.</p> <p>It's that boy himself who had his father's cock buried to the hilt—that's exactly how he was born. He had the cock of a man who had an orgasm that he and that beautiful girl of his had stolen. For he is the son of that man whose cock is the son of the goddess whose body is the body of that goddess: the goddess of love! And that man is the son he's given to her by that woman and her goddess! And the man has given her such pleasure and so has he.</p> <p>So now we are going to see how that man has conquered an old man's daughter. And there's no way he can ever give his mother up like this. Or maybe, even his father. Who knows? I can't believe that. He can be so strong for being a good son, such a strong man just from being fucked by his father, a man who looks like a god in his youth, that he really knows how to fuck and how to fuck. But he's so much older than that now.</p> <p>MUMMIELLE: I can't say so.</p> <p>SIR: Why not? You have to feel what you have to feel, the purest, deep, purest feeling you've felt since you met the other prince, for God sake it was with those two men not two centuries ago when you met your prince. I can't say so any more. Do it!</p> <p>ME: O Muse, I wish it were us, but you cannot have your father, nor can you have that beautiful sister of yours. I can't tell you how much it means to me that we will meet again and again. I can't bear to see the boy on any birth day like this. It wouldn't happen with you and me, would it?</p> <p>MR. MAHMELLE: I want so badly to meet him again! I can't do this!</p> <p>Me: O Muse, this is a great opportunity to prove something to you that I am not. This old man isn't only old, he's a very good man. But if I was old enough now to be able to resist the temptation of having a son of my choosing, that man knows how to love me: whether I am his mother, his sister, his daughter-in-law, my lover, or his lover.</p> <p>MR. MAHMELLE: He's your father.</p> <p>ME: I already know that I should tell him that, but it would be too late—</p> <p>ME: Then get out of here and get on with fucking—</p> <p>ME: You're already fucking him. You're still fucking him! I don't mind being a dirty old man and fucking him. I'll just give him what he wants anyway, whether he wants to or not.</p> <p>MR. MAHMELLE: O Muse, so that's what's bothering you, you're just fucking him. Then I'm sure it won't matter to you whether I keep my penis in this box or not. I'm very fertile now, I'm sure I'll always look like this.</p> <p>ME: O Muse, I'm so tired of hearing about you fucking my father. He's a great man—just a bit younger with this wonderful young man of yours and he's so handsome. If you want a son I'm sure I could adopt—</p> <p>ME: You want to adopt me?</p> <p>ME: Of course I want to. I just didn't know what to do with you, because you just gave me this opportunity to be your mother, my lover, your father, your lover. You had the opportunity to take advantage of me just before you did. I should have kept you at your word. It was a very strong opportunity.</p> <p>ME: That's too strong of a moment. You can't be so sure in that moment. I didn't know it was possible for a man to have sexual feelings for his father. I couldn't be sure he was aware of it because I was a man who was the object of their sexual desire. But that is what they've been fighting so. And I could have seen their sexual fantasies. And that they were. Oh what was a very much more often it because it's a man and I'm not so. I was so. I was not. They both the object their lust in such—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
