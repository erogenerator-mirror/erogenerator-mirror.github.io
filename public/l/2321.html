M. Barrie </h3><h4>Chapter 9 THE NEVER BIRD</h4><p><strong>The last sound Peter heard before he was quite alone were the mermaids retiring one by one to their bedchambers under the sea. He was too far away to hear</strong> them.</p> <p>His bed was already creaking with activity and Peter was glad his bedroom was in there. Just looking out at the sea made him wish he could have taken his clothes off in the ocean right then.</p> <p>He loved fucking. It was so sexy and exciting. His cock was getting stiffer with each stroke.</p> <p>It was time for him to stop worrying about sex, get dressed, take off his clothes so they could fuck in the ocean.</p> <p>"Here I am thinking of going out in the ocean," Peter said. "You know, like this one," he laughed aloud.</p> <p>Peter pulled on his clothes. He was glad to be naked after the afternoon's sexual escapades. He was sure she would be as naked as he was.</p> <p>His eyes wandered over the sea. He was pretty sure his cock was getting hard right now. He couldn't do anything to stop that feeling.</p> <p>He took his shirt over his head. He could feel something soft rubbing against his abs.</p> <p>His cock was throbbing.</p> <p>He took off his shirt. His cock was throbbing too. And he couldn't stop staring at his hard cock.</p> <p>It seemed so naughty to have this guy ogling his cock while he stared at the sea.</p> <p>"Here, I'll take care of this before we change our minds," Peter said in a soft, matter of fact voice of his own.</p> <p>He walked over to his bed chamber door.</p> <p>"We can do something, like go get some condoms," Peter said, smiling. He took off his socks and got into bed. His cock was throbbing too hard to do much. But that was going to change soon. So he put on condom and climbed on his nightstand. He took the condom and put it on his hard cock.</p> <p>His cock was pointing right at the ocean. It seemed so sexy that he started moving his hard cock up and down the ocean. He wanted to fuck like this. He loved the feeling of his hard cock sliding between the warm sand and the sea.</p> <p>"That thing will keep your cock hard for more than a few minutes."</p> <p>"Maybe, maybe not," he said. He wanted to tease his cock with the feel of it rubbing against his face again and again. It would help his cock stay hard this time. He loved feeling his hot, hard cock pressing into his eyes. It had felt like a great sexual experience.</p> <p>But then the feeling came back, in time with the waves. His cock stayed hard! It felt sexy and hot so far this time.</p> <p>"That is nice," Peter said in one word. His tone turned to a seductive tone. "You feel sexy when you're hard inside me."</p> <p>"I liked that. I loved how excited I was." Just his way of saying, a sex act. That got him going so much he didn't realize how much.</p> <p>He continued to moan as he moved his cock up and down. He felt an incredible feeling of warmth and wet feel. It felt so great. This was the best feeling of his life. He was glad he had done that, after so many years of having no sexual experience to compare to.</p> <p>Peter tried to make his cum as long as it took to cum because he wanted to go slow with his cock in the ocean before he ejaculated but he couldn't stop until he came.</p> <p>This time, he went slow. He felt so much pleasure as he let his hot cum spurted onto his face. He wanted to cum again. And then again. There would have to be more cum in his pants, in the sea, in the ocean and all over his stomach.</p> <p>"Keep doing that for me, Peter," Peter said, still panting. "Keep sucking cock."</p> <p>"Can I fuck you?" he asked.</p> <p>"You can, yes. But you can't cum in my mouth or on my breasts."</p> <p>"Oh, alright... I'll try."</p> <p>Peter's fingers caressed his soft cock. His cum-covered fingers touched his dick, his balls, his legs. It felt erotic. He couldn't believe how it felt to be fucked before he came, before he could control his cock like he hoped he could control himself.</p> <p>"Come on. Go lay down."</p> <p>Peter lay down on all fours. He could feel the ocean around his wet cock as it slid back and forth and out of the ocean. It felt good for him to lay on his stomach, especially after all the excitement of the day.</p> <p>But as he felt himself getting harder all over, it was getting difficult to lie there without any longer.</p> <p></p> <p>"Come on, Peter."</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>You take me... I... take... me. Me... Me.</p> <p>... Me."You.
