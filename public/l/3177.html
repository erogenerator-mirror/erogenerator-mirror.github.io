M. Montgomery </h3><h4>CHAPTER XXXVII. The Reaper Whose Name Is Death</h4><p><strong>MATTHEW—Matthew—what is the matter? Matthew, are you sick?” It was Marilla who spoke, alarm in every jerky word. Anne came through the hall, her hands full of white narcissus,—it was</strong> all the way between, the way to heaven or hell. She said it the best way to get a black cock up her white pussy.</p> <p>We had a great time, but we have to go now, Anne says in a voice that could have used some more color. When I hear you say goodbye to her I want you to be there for me, Matt says, he and Marilla will go home in a hurry. I’m not going. I'll take the bus to the airport, Matthew, they both have to go back to their own house to be a couple. We’ll tell Marilla tomorrow and see. The good news is it doesn’t matter to me that they’ve got an appointment to meet to do sex or anything, that I’m a black cock slut to fuck, and Matt is a black cock stud, and you know it, I swear, Marilla he is a black cock stud, and you’re a white-cocks stud. That is why I don’t care I’m a fucking slut. What about you, Matthew?”</p> <p>Anne is smiling.”Yes, I don’t care, I’m going. I can’t believe how much this turns me on just to talk about it. I can’t stand to see you here when I get back from France. When the doorbell rings, get on the bed, and get the black boy to fuck you.”</p> <p>That is how they were to arrange our time for the next morning, Marilla says while kissing Anne on the mouth.</p> <p>"Yes, Matt. We can talk this afternoon," Marilla said, "because we like to be able to talk in a private setting."</p> <p>"Yes," he replied, "we know."</p> <p>"You and I will see just one more time. Is that OK? Oh, yes, there are more photos, and I’m sure you’ll like them, too."</p> <p>He took a couple more photos.”And the sex will be all right?"</p> <p>"Sure, Matt, if that’s what you think. We’ll see. I don’t care. But that is the next step. I’m sure Marilla. Come on."</p> <p>Matt and Anne had made love and fucked as many times as Marilla told them it would take to make this trip. Matt was very eager and took the photo’s a lot, but the other thing he took was Marilla’s black cock. When he was done with it he looked at the photo as a special thank you for it. He thought to himself: You’re such a lucky guy. Oh, and I brought a photo of his cock. It was a picture of Marilla in a bathtub and having a bath and then she went to work with it with lukewarm water. And she told him it will do for that occasion.</p> <p>Then Anne took the photo and they had sex again. They were both so much in love with one another. The next day they went to their friends at a beach resort in the Mediterranean and spent the day fucking and sucking each other, in a sexual haze.</p> <p>And Matt was in love with his favorite blonde in Spain—Marilla. But they didn’t make love. They were both fucking and sucking each other in a sexual haze. It was the most wonderful sex, they realized as Matt and Anne fucked and sucked each other. Matt went home that day thinking of his favorite blonde. Marilla went back to her parents and Matt got a message.</p> <p>“Dear Mr. Anderson. I had such a great time getting your photo. I’m going to get you your copy of the book to see for the birthday party next week. It’s a very special present for me. I’m going to pick up these pictures for my birthday. I’ll be back in town this week to go shopping and get some things. And if I get a gift for this evening I may get a special present or two. I’m sure in my mind it makes up for all that. And I can’t wait. And Matt, I love you both so much. Can we get together sooner?”—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
