The trip was uneventful; there wasn't a whole lot to do, but I was anxious to get back to his room. I wanted to spend as much time as I could with him, but our plans for tonight left a lot more to be desired than what was done up to myself.</p> <p>With a small smile and a knowing glance, I made my way to his room, which was the suite of rooms in town. I knocked once at the door and got no response. I wanted an answer, since I was sure my parents were asleep downstairs. When I opened the connecting door, I found my parents' room empty. I was in no hurry to go, but I made my way slowly to his bed before I reached the bottom.</p> <p>The duvet was neatly laid on the floor and I snuggled underneath. I was too nervous to kiss him, no matter how I tried. I got on my knees on the bed and slid my pants down to my thighs. As I did this, I felt his hands touching me. I spread my legs apart for him and he pushed my panties off, making himself comfortable when he looked me square in the eye. He ran his hands roughly over my butt and down to my thighs, and I felt his dick press against my crotch. He made no move to take his pants off as my hand was pushing against the base of his dong. I rubbed his dick and it responded as he got harder, making it harder for me.</p> <p>I rolled and kissed him, which allowed him to move my panties off.</p> <p>"Do you still haven't had sex?" I asked with a smile.</p> <p>He nodded and continued undressing. I rolled over again and he put his face right in my crotch. I felt his hand on my butt, holding it and squeezing. It was all I could do to move it away. I felt fingers slide inside me again, this time slipping between my lips. His lips followed his tongue and pushed a finger inside me, making me even more excited. He pulled his face away and turned me on my back.</p> <p>He slid himself into me until he was buried to the hilt. Before then, he paused when he was completely inside me and made his way slowly to my face. He kissed me and I responded equally with his kiss. As our tongues played together, I could also feel his dick growing harder as it pressed against me and his hand slid along my stomach. I knew that he was excited, but I didn't let him cum to far or yet.</p> <p>His erection was pressing against me and I made myself comfortable as he slowly slipped inside me.</p> <p>"You're so tight," he whispered in my ear.</p> <p>I pushed my body up against him and reached down and rubbed his dick against my finger.</p> <p>"I haven't had a good fucking since college," I told him with a smile. "But you're a great fuck, you know. So don't feel bad," I said.</p> <p>John lifted himself up until he felt the top of me. "It's your turn," he said.</p> <p>He kissed me again and slipped his dick out, leaving me to watch, both interested in seeing what I could do to get him back and excited because of how he was making me feel. He began fucking me, slowly at first. He didn't use anything in it, either, except for the occasional bump against the thin wall between the two beds. When he picked my legs up and spread them further apart, he brought my legs up even further until I was right at the perfect level to watch.</p> <p>He took his time, making sure it was smooth and I took some time to adjust. I looked at a gorgeous man and enjoyed all my thoughts as his dick slid in and out of me. I could also feel his dick pushing against my cervix. He kept his hands firmly on my knees to keep me spread open as he fucked me. His strokes were just short enough for me to get a clear view of him fucking me. I was surprised to find that they felt good, even though I hadn't seen it at all in the movie once.</p> <p>"You're too good," I cooed.</p> <p>"You like it doggy?" He asked, and I nodded.</p> <p>"Fuck me hard too," I said, and he complied.</p> <p>He got his arms around my waist and started pounding harder. The friction against my clit and his dick sent me into orbit.</p> <p>"Harder," I said without words. the second time we went with him and only. I could. I was talking. I let go. That's words. . I didn't have to him know. I said. So hard now thatâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
