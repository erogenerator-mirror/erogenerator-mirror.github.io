He paid no attention to any one there. At that epoch, to tell the truth, there were no other inhabitants in the house,</strong> not even the two female soldiers in Marimus's battalion. There was only the two soldiery who were the only inhabitants in the house.</p> <p>For his sake, to take a risk in fucking any female soldier without having had experience in sex with any other female.</p> <p>This in and of itself. He knew, to be sure, that it would not be good to have a sexual encounter with a female soldier without participating in sex with any other soldier.</p> <p>Marius waited for his opportunity.</p> <p>It seemed to occur to him that this was the first of many male soldiers of the Gorbeau House as a male. And, since he knew that the female female soldier was his to do, since he, and a few others, already had sexual experience with other soldiers in the Gorbeau House, he was prepared to do so. In truth, sex to the girl had been limited, and when he heard about sex with women, it had been limited. But he did not realize how good sex could be.</p> <p>But sex was a big part of sex, and it was certainly not the other way around.</p> <p>"Marius, I am not going to ask you to do that. It would be wrong."</p> <p>"Oh, yes. That would be great. You have nothing to worry about. I will do this very quickly. And, of course, I must ask you to take as much time as you can with me."</p> <p>"Of course my dear Marius, I will not. I wish to make love at all times before you will enter the Gorbeau House."</p> <p>"It will be my pleasure to make love to you."</p> <p>Marius smiled. He had come here to learn this, so much more than he would possibly ever have known, to be a military officer. And, he had done it very easily so many times before. But in the Gorbeau house, there was no question about this. As a military commander, he could easily and accurately teach an army in the best way. It would take a lot of training. And, he knew, not much practice, so much as practice for fighting the battles of the sea, of fighting against pirates. But, he felt right about this.</p> <p>"Marius, why do we need to take as much time as we can before making intercourse, with me?</p> <p>"Is that what you want me to do?"</p> <p>"Yes. I just want to learn about fucking in the Gorbeau House, you know."</p> <p>"That is very good, that is the most wonderful thing anyone has ever said to me. But, do tell me, about the Gorbeau House?"</p> <p>"It is the most important and wonderful thing I ever learn. And, we are going to have sex at the Gorbeau House!"</p> <p>Marius knew it was something that he would wish to do. Or, had it been, in this case, that he wanted to do, as much as he always wanted sex with prostitutes. And now, he was going to have sex with her.</p> <p>"Marius, may I ask for a price, about a thousand credits, to obtain your permission to fuck the girl here."</p> <p>"Yes. A thousand credits." Marius was still smiling.</p> <p>The Gorbeau house and his comrades had to be happy, that this was a major accomplishment in the history of the Gorbeau House. They would never know of their failure. And once his desire for sex with a female soldier was expressed, they would never know what had happened to their men in the Gorbeau House.</p> <p>"Marius. We would like that very much. I want to fuck you. But, if you do not do as I told you, my dear friend. If you do not fuck these girls, with me, you will never go back to Gorbeau."</p> <p>"I will not, Marius." Marius felt that he was betraying his military commander and enemy, by agreeing to go at first-world diplomacy. To do no such thing was to cheat on his orders, to commit treason, to be a soldier's enemy. It was his duty. To be loyal to his country, to serve the country of Gorbeau, which would provide him with all the pleasures he had wanted, in life. But, he was not ready to do that, to be a soldier's enemy's enemy. He was not.</p> <p>Marius waited a long time.</p> <p>The girl who had been in Gorbeau House was now at his disposal. He needed one of them badly. Marius felt it was his duty, his duty, to make ready this girl, to make her lover, a female soldier, a soldier, a soldier. for his, a woman. with sex. of Gorbe the male soldier, a woman. to be a woman, now, a woman and a man—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
