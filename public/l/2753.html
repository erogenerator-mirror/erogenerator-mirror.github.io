He could be executed. His hands began to beat a tattoo upon her ass.</p> <p>"No! Don't be too serious! I'll beat you as hard as you beat me! There's no way you're going to beat me," she said in a voice that brooked no defiance. "That's what I said."</p> <p>There were not very many women standing on the porch of his house. All of them were wearing long sleeves and looking at him in contempt. Even though she was a stranger to him, she was the most dangerous of the bunch in his mind. There were a million other girls in that house with him. He knew that there might be an accident. But he couldn't be sure. There was a reason why such an unlikely occurrence was the case.</p> <p>There was nothing to be done. He walked away from her. He reached for the door handle of the porch. He heard footsteps. Just the sound of feet on the porch, and he realized that a party would break out. But he did not dare go to the nearest house. It might break out for what he assumed was a very public instance of sex. The sounds of hands slapping flesh might be heard as well, yet also they could be imagined caressing bodies.</p> <p>"I'm going to go now. I'll be back as soon as possible." Harme, with her hands cuffed behind her back, exited her house. He could hear the sound of her keys crunching in some papers. He would have seen her walking to her car. He was gone when she returned home. He sat in his car for a long time. The minutes ticked by; it seemed as if never-ending.</p> <p>"Harley. You don't even know when your next class is until it's over," she said. "What's wrong with you?"</p> <p>Harley didn't know how to answer that one. He knew his first time was over. He was afraid that someone was going to come into his experience at the hands of a stranger. Then it was her turn. He had to decide how to deal with that.</p> <p>"What was it like? At what cost? Was it an orgasm?" he asked.</p> <p>"Did it hurt?"</p> <p>"When I was younger."</p> <p>"It's not like I've never had it."</p> <p>"Yeah, right," she said. "What are you talking about?"</p> <p>How stupid of Harme. She was not supposed to be able to have orgasms at all. She had not even graduated from high school. It was only a matter of a few months ago. Now, after she finished at graduate school, she had been forced to do so many things. That was just her nature. Why would she want him any ways? The question of consequences was foremost in her brain. She would probably be on the brink of death if he did not rescue her soonâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
