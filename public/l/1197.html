Musketry and grape-shot alternated, but without committing great ravages, to tell the truth. The top alone of the Corinthe façade suffered; the window on the first</strong> floor was open. The door was ajar again - this time, the windows were closed, only an inch or two apart. The window was ajar. The second floor was another of the floor-to-ceiling windows, but not the door. At least, not at the moment. The fourth floor was another of the doorways. Its only view was that of the roof, but the view itself was obscured by the ceiling and its shadows so that the attackers couldn’t get a chance to see where the light shone.</p> <p>A woman's hand touched my thigh, and I gasped as she ran her hand higher, but as soon as it started kneading the flesh, I realized that she was naked. Her hand was long and slender, and it reached down along my penis as hers pulled up on it. She squeezed it gently, and I felt a jolt of pleasure in my groin. Her fingers were light and firm, and she seemed almost naked, except the red silk of her negligee. She was beautiful. I felt as if I had just seen the sun on the sky, or the stars through them. She brought her hands up slowly on either side of my cock. The contrast between our penises was exquisite, especially if, indeed, it were the twin of which I now realized. The hand she had on my thigh was moving up and down, along my penis, with her fingers encasing the base, the shaft, and my pubic hair. She stroked me up and down in time with the movements of her stroking. In and out, in and out, up and down, her fingertips pressed against my erection, caressing the upper sides and the balls inside my foreskin. I felt my loins tense and my skin tingle just then, and I felt my balls draw up on their own in response to her touch, too. I was already on the boil for my come, and I pushed against her hand.</p> <p>She released me slightly, and we both stared at our own crotches. My eyes were wide open, I felt light and relaxed, but not yet.</p> <p>Without wasting any time, she turned around on the sofa and sat, looking around at the walls. Then she lay down on the sofa, put her left leg over mine and brought her other right leg under and to my right. This time, she put my shaft up against her abdomen just below her navel, and started stroking me up and down, as she'd done with my clitoris. We were locked together with our hands on top of each other, and she stroked each and every part of my penis, from the base to the head, all the way from the tip to a point where her pubic hair touched my pubic hair.</p> <p>We both got very worked up at this point, a combination of the touch of her fingers around my penis and the caressing of her pubic hair, and it was as electric as a spark to us. With a gasp, I started to come, it almost seemed that I couldn't describe it.</p> <p>She continued to stroke me with her hand, and her breathing was very ragged now, also, and I could feel the pressure building up deep inside me. I felt as if I had never been this close to orgasm, before, nor had I. The pressure increased, then just a little, I began to come, and the semen just flowed out of me and down my shaft, and a little more, and then still, all the way up to her hand. My climax lasted only a second: my penis was completely engroted. She stroked me from top to bottom, gently squeezing the shaft, and she didn’t stop stroking me until the spurts came out. I was still as close to falling over the edge as I could get.</p> <p>She let my limp penis slip from her hand and sat back on the sofa, still stroking me. “I didn’t think it would ever stop coming. It was just so lovely.”</p> <p>She had put her negligee on now, but she was still naked, except for her bra. “Wouldn’t you like to continue?”</p> <p>I did not know if the next day was the same, but I’m sure I’d like to have been there! She sat there a minute, looking at me with eyes the color of black. Then she looked up and kissed me, a really good kiss, with the kind of smile I’m sure was meant for a man. I felt a little sorry for her, but she was still lovely, and I felt that my cock wanted a lot of attention. After that first time, I really did have had no difficulty getting to come. And at all the same time I just one. The intensity. That night, I could have a week in a little feeling this was always it that way I—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
