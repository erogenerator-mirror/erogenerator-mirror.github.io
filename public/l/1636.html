I had a long day tomorrow and I was exhausted; but I also didn't want to say much anymore.</p> <p>It took almost two hours before I heard the door open outside. After a few long seconds of darkness, I saw him, a naked man, standing at my bedroom door. "You're late," he said, and he looked back at me as I lay there. He gave me an odd look and left, closing the door after him.</p> <p>About two minutes later I heard the doorbell rang again. Then another man walked in and sat on my bed.</p> <p>I felt my legs go almost completely numb by then.</p> <p>The man on my bed looked at me and said "Your mother is here to see you."</p> <p>For a moment (and a few seconds) I thought I really wanted this to end; but before I could think of anything else I felt his fingers on my thigh. I saw him look at me with confusion.</p> <p>"Can I see you?" He said again. "Please let me see you."</p> <p>"Just a minute," I said, and I pulled up my nightie, pulled down my panties and rolled away from him. I stood, naked except for my bra and panties, and he smiled as he stared at me. "Do you want me to go?" I asked, and he nodded. I saw his cock harden and I pulled down my nightie and watched it rise. I was wet; my body was hungry for what he wanted.</p> <p>I saw his cock pulse, saw the foreskin stretch as it began to turn purple; saw him shudder as his orgasm ran through him.</p> <p>"Oh, my God," I said to myself. He made me come in the same minute.</p> <p>He was tall. He was in his 50s. He had dark hair, and his face was dark.</p> <p>We hugged. We kissed. We embraced and kissed some more; my breasts pressed against him and I pulled him to me. I felt his big erection poking me. When we stopped kissing I felt his hand on my other thigh. He pulled up my nightie to his neck and rubbed all over my tummy and my thighs; and finally cupped my sex and my breasts, and gently squeezed while he pushed the inside of my thigh open.</p> <p>We rolled to the center of the bed; this time not on my bed anymore. He laid beside me, his penis erect and I rubbed his cock to a good rhythm. As the pleasure of his cock rubbed me more and more, it was now more and more urgent so that I pressed him and urged him; wanting this to last forever.</p> <p>He came once, and after that was a dream that lasted until dark-blue sky began to seep into our faces, and we fell asleep—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
