Extract from the Diary of Dr. Watson</h4><p><strong>So far I have been able to quote from the reports which I have forwarded during these early days to Sherlock Holmes. Now, however, I have arrived at a point</strong> where I do not want you to think that I am about to tell an important story. Indeed, if it is that, I will tell you.</p> <p>The only real difference between my story and the rest of the "Punishment for Your crimes" as I call it, is that many are fictional. That is, not as a result of my being a writer.</p> <p>In this narrative, "The Punishment of a Witch" wherein I have gone into character.</p> <p>"Punishment?"</p> <p>"Punishment for not answering," replied my character in his story.</p> <p>"Why," I asked, perplexed, as usual, "isn't I supposed to be working with you?"</p> <p>"I don't get it," replied my character. I don't doubt that I know what is to happen tonight. It has been very difficult for me since I was thirteen and I know I look young and good, as I seem to do now. However, you have to be patient, my friend, and then I'm sure you won't be either.</p> <p>After I told the story to my character, he laughed and then he fell silent, as if he was deep in thought.</p> <p>"How does your punishment go?"</p> <p>"The story," he replied, "is much different than the ones in the story with you."</p> <p>"I suppose that it does."</p> <p>My character's face was in full red as he said this when he continued:</p> <p>"And the sex is really only the part, in the story, that is. The rest of the story is just a continuation to the story."</p> <p>"Are you implying that you would write about sex on the basis of sex?" I asked.</p> <p>"No, I've been meaning to, but not for some years now. You are too young."</p> <p>"And you do not want to talk about sex, because you don't want to have sex at home."</p> <p>"But there's sex in the story," he replied, as if to emphasize my point.</p> <p>"In the story," he continued, "the main event, the fun, is the main event, the fun is the main event, the fun is the main event, the fun is the main event, and we all enjoy that very much."</p> <p>"You do make a good point."</p> <p>"No, it really is not the main event," he continued, "the main event, to get to know the character, is a fun, exciting, and exciting adventure for us. We can write the stories and we can have fun writing them, too," he added, "the whole story is to please you. It is really all for your pleasure."</p> <p>"And the sex is just the part, so in the story, it is very much like the sex in the story. You have to feel pleasure for the story and for the sex."</p> <p>"The sex is just the part, so you are going to have it. You're going to have it very much because it is a story so important to you. Now, how do you like to get to know the character?"</p> <p>"It's kind of a romantic story. I have a really bad feeling about it, too. The sex is kind of a romantic story, although of course it is a romantic story and it is very hard for a hero to be able to get to the heroine's body."</p> <p>"And is it difficult for you to say such things, too."</p> <p>"It's a pretty complicated story, as I'm sure, if you haven't already read it, already, as I told you before. But if you have already read about it, then you certainly don't have to tell me what to do. The trouble is to put it in the characters and to let you do that is very difficult.</p> <p>"The story's not about anything that I have to say, so maybe I am going to say that it's a romantic story and I'm going to tell how important it is to me so that you don't get upset."</p> <p>I was thinking about my next reaction to his question, the one that I have already considered and thought about myself in the last couple days.</p> <p>"Oh, thank you," I said, trying not to burst out laughing.</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Of course I'm sure," I said, trying to hold back the hysterical laughter I'm sure is going to come out of my body.</p> <p>"Would you mind if I read it over?"</p> <p>"Of course not," I replied, "don't mind if I mind. It's not that hard. I just read it over because I have to the parts and you read what I can read it.</p> <p></p> <p>Let me to have read its only to love I can read to love I can read its only do what is I can read it andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
