She declared, and with her hand on the back of the couch, she rose to her knees, ready for the first round of blissful thrusts she had to deliver as soon as the head would fall into the depths of her womb. Her hand wrapped around her husband's cock, and she drove herself to paradise.</p> <p>Within just a few heartbeats, an overwhelming chorus of joys and euphoric feelings that were quickly rising in her consciousness and on her soul, had swept her up in a magical wave of euphoric bliss that was completely overwhelmed. She knew that her body was on its way to be completely satisfied, and that she was going to savor the pleasure for the rest of her day. Her body was the center of her universe, and she was ready to use it.</p> <p>Within seconds, a new wave of contentment swept through her. Every sense in her body was in tune with her sexual feelings. Her mind was floating. Everything in her mind had become focused. She knew what she wanted, and she knew that she was ready for it.</p> <p>Her body shook violently as the ecstatic sensations hit her. Without a conscious will, any sense on her part was lost. Her body's responses had been overridden, and her mind was made aware as if it was alive. She could simply go on without thinking at all.</p> <p>With a loud cry of pleasure, she fell into this blissful state of bliss. She felt that if anything had happened the moment just prior, it would be better for her, because her emotions would be stronger, because her own desires would be stronger, and because her husband would be pleased because he wasn't fucked, and was filled by pleasure.</p> <p>"I know! I know! I know!" She thought briefly, her eyes brimming with joy, and the joy of being satisfied, not having to worry about whether anyone was fucking her. "You're going to make mommy cum, aren't you honey?"</p> <p>Her eyes were wide. No longer had her body been held in an eternal, blissless embrace. There was no mistaking his love for her, and she was his proud daughter. "Oh, honey," she whimpered. "Oh, yes! Yes, that's sooo good!"</p> <p>She knew when it came, and that moment was that one. Her body was on top of hers, on the bed, a hundred feet off the ground, and she was riding her husband's cock. The world around her disappeared, and there was nothing else within her world except her feeling. Nothing else existed except her feeling for the feel of being thoroughly fucked and taking pleasure.</p> <p>It was nothing other than, "This is going to be an amazing day!"</p> <p>Her body was completely consumed by pleasure, with everything she could think of to feel better even if it wasn't her husband's cock that was fucking her. Her body was on fire, and without thinking, she felt like she was in tune with it. She rode her husband's cock, and she wanted more. She wanted it to be better, and she wanted it harder, and she needed him to do more for her.</p> <p>"Yes! Fuck me! Fuck me!" She was screaming out loud. "Oh, please! Please just fuck me! Fuck me!" She begged, as she rode her husband with her pussy. "Yes! I'll make you cum!" She screamed, begging for more. "Yes! Take it! Do it now!" She yelled, feeling a burning in her belly.</p> <p>When her body finally fell into the most blissful state, she felt like she was floating, and she knew that she was flying, and that her happiness could only come to her from fucking. After a lifetime of the perfect union that only a man could truly possess, it was time for reality, and the time to be with her.</p> <p>"Oh!" She gasped. "This is amazing!" She looked around in wonder at the sky and saw no other way. They were in her world, and they were real. She thought about the fact that they were all her own, not just some big fake imaginary guy, who could fuck her. She was on the point that they could actually do her, and she thought about being the one, not the person.</p> <p>It was the way it was when a man had just fucked her. If she were wearing one of those black stretch pants, it was that she could wear a g-in at a man's place. And they could fuck her, and fuck. On the whole thing. She was a perfect. They could do to her whole. She could do to her. As she. She could do she. She felt it could do she.
