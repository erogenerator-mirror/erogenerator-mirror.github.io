An angry countenance is much against nature, and it is oftentimes</h4><p><strong>the proper countenance of them that are at the point of death. But were it so, that all anger and passion were so thoroughly quenched in thee, that it were</strong> with unadulterated joy, that they should go to naught to waste? The real meaning of a good fuck is by having a good climax.</p> <p>This is certainly true even at these moments, but so often in my day of mourning; in my soul and in my spirit. The best fuck is when thy love is full and in its core, and only to have that love filled to the brim is the greatest pleasure in both your soul, and in your loins. And this love, is to be expressed and taken by one who, when taken by the other, will always know to give him the best.</p> <p>This particular moment in my life, was when I first met the true love of my life, and he whom I love now in the very first place.</p> <p>It was on the last day of mourning when I had my first orgasm.</p> <p>I looked at the wall clock that the clock said that it was time for me to get ready to leave and go away; to go anywhere with a beautiful man who, when he found me, was so special, then I'd have a nice farewell before I went home to my husband.</p> <p>And, it had been five weeks since our meeting on the very next day. And, it was still seven days until our next one.</p> <p>There had not been any actual fucking that we have ever had in my life, until this day. I was alone with a handsome man with whom I loved more than life itself. And, what had we been doing, as I was in the presence of him, until now?</p> <p>I had spent my time with her at a fancy chateau. She had the most beautiful lingerie which she wore in every imaginable way. She liked to wear the very low cut bra which left her boobs uncovered. And, in just this one bra, her nipples were standing at more than half an inch, and she was wearing a long white silk dress, the one that she slept in at the house before I left for the office, with the most lovely of panties which gave me so much satisfaction.</p> <p>When I first told her I wished to join her at the chateau, the chateau she was to have, she was so pleased to hear my request, and the night we were together, we had slept together. After our first coupling, I had asked her to bring herself to an orgasm, but she still got nervous about that, and not so much about the others to come, not really because I had promised, but rather because I didn't know what else to expect during our time together.</p> <p>The evening of our first visit to the Chateau, which had been on that first Saturday on our last day in the world, I had told her I felt a slight ache of sorrow that she didn't know what would happen, but she took my word for it, and that it would be just right for us to join it. And then, I had kissed her, and we had had our first sexual experience; a sexual experience; which, in the name of the Lord and Savior, it has not been, and she had no regrets of leaving me, after her love for me was gone.</p> <p>I told her that my love for her was so strong, I thought that I would be able to do it, which was the truth, and in spite of that, there was a part of me which thought it was as well, at least to a casual level, and so she had asked me where we had been, and the answer, of course, was not that I had wanted to come back, for that was not what her love for me was. I have told her she didn't do it; she didn't want me to see her like that.</p> <p>However, she had kissed me, had kissed my vagina, and had let me finger her. We had fucked, and had felt a lot of pleasure, and yet, it was still the beginning of the relationship.</p> <p>Well, that was the beginning. There was one more thing that I still hadn't told you. The love she had for me, that I had never known was there, in the beginning of our relationship (because, I think, she never loved me, as much as she loved me, at this point) was just as strong as the affection I had always had for her. She liked to give herself to me freely, when she felt I was giving back.</p> <p>We had spent a wonderful time together, and after that, there was another occasion, when I had been in a bit of a hurry; I had told her I wasn't too tired, and I wanted to have another go. But she hadn't understood what I meant. So I told her of the reason; that I couldn't go; that I was too weak. The Lord. I had been too weak. So I was I. That evening. So there was nothing to love it, inâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
