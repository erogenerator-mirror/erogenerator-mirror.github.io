Four weeks’ torture, tossing, and sickness! Oh, these bleak winds and bitter northern skies, and impassable roads, and dilatory country surgeons! And oh,</strong> how they wanted to help.</p> <p>Her hands were all over me. I knew what she wanted and wanted! Her body moved with mine with a sweet lust. Her body demanded to be touched! The fire in the pit of my loins screamed for me to be inside her!</p> <p>I lifted her and set her upon the edge of the bed and began to ravage her body again. One hand cupped her sex, rolling her nipples with the other. Two fingers found her labia and I plunged into her with one thrust. Her arms went around me. Her mouth met my kiss and our tongues darted and explored. As my mouth found her breasts, she writhed beneath me in the throes of her passion.</p> <p>Her legs came up and wrapped around me, opening herself to accept me completely. Her arms tightened around me as she began to tremble within the wild mists of her passion.</p> <p>"Oh, I love you," she whispered into my ear as her hips rose under my onslaught.</p> <p>"I love you too, but now come.”</p> <p>I was on top of her, but I began to withdraw slowly, the shaft of cock entering her as I continued to kiss her. I was on my knees between her legs. My cock was as thick as her wrist. It was long and black, the head almost purple. It thrust into her with a groan of pleasure and she was crying as she felt me inside her. Her whole body was trembling under my weight. I began to move again, then faster, wanting her to come. I sensed she was getting closer and my thrusts were deeper.</p> <p>Her knees were trembling. Her eyes were closed. She was moaning uncontrollably. And she was coming!</p> <p>Her hips rose to meet my thrusts, and in that suddenness she became aware of who she was fucking! She raised herself to meet me, and her whole body began to shudder in ecstasy.</p> <p>I reached up and cupped her beautiful tits, pinching the nipples with a finger between them. She opened her eyes and looked at me, her face flushed, her eyes pleading.</p> <p>“Yes,” she moaned,” I want it! I want you in my tight pussy,” she said.</p> <p>“Come, baby!” I replied. “I want us to come together.”</p> <p>She was crying out, again, incoherently, the sounds of a woman about to fuck another woman as far as her body would go. The sounds echoed in my ears.</p> <p>“I feel you, baby!” she said. “I feel you in my pussy,” she said. “I love you!”</p> <p>Her legs began to tremble. Finally, her body began to go into wild convulsions, bucking upon me,” Yes! That’s it,” she screamed. “Oh! Oh!! Aaaaaaaahhhhh!”</p> <p>Her legs began to lose their grip, and finally she lay still, shuddering, as I lay on top of her and kissed her, and pulled her nipples,” and kissed her face, and her neck, and kissed her breasts,” and kissed her,”</p> <p>She’d let me fuck her twice this way. She never allowed it to end. I wanted to. She wanted me to fuck her. There was no other choice,” she said. “Fuck me, I want you to fuck me. Do me,”.</p> <p>“I will, I will, but first we must go somewhere safe.” She looked at me, the look still strange in her face, and said. “Oh, can we walk,”.</p> <p>We got up, dried one another and walked,” holding hands, to her car.</p> <p>The first step she took was to take me inside and she leaned into me and kissed my lips, then my chin, my neck, and my shoulder. She caressed the exposed flesh and I kissed it as a lass and kissed that same tender flesh.</p> <p>“I’m sorry I couldn’t…” it came out in a whisper. “I just had to...…” She stopped. “Shhhh. You’ve got a problem.”</p> <p>“I want you," she cried, “but not all the way.</p> <p>It only went on like that until I had to get to her home. Ail’s house, but that was what the first decision to my conscience felt too. The way with. What I had seen a small woman. That was what the way, if it was, and it was.
