In Christianity it is called truth. A Christian faith in its day is not based on anything outside, but on God's word. To be honest, we're not convinced that God created the Christian doctrine. We believe that everything that matters to Christians and to you, has a spiritual basis in the Christian teachings rather than it is an abstract theory."</p> <p>"You're right, but what did you mean by 'Christian Doctrine"? I replied.</p> <p>"Well, let's start with that, shall we?" he laughed, "How do you feel about being naked in public?" I replied.</p> <p>"You've got a point, dear. Let's go get some dinner, I must say, with some wine, and discuss the Christian doctrine that I believe you're trying to teach me."</p> <p>With that the couple dressed and went off to get some dinner. I don't know what took me in, considering I had never been naked in a public place. That night, I was really horny when I left my apartment and drove to the university for some serious study.</p> <p>Chapter 9 (Sunday)</p> <p>Sunday afternoon, I joined Mary and Simon in the restaurant for dinner. It was early and busy, yet lively. As we were about to finish, Simon and Mary said that they had been watching an episode of late-night football and had invited some friends over for a drink afterwards. Simon and Mary had come prepared to serve them as guests. It wasn't quite the way I anticipated it to go, but it did provide a pleasant diversion for all of us.</p> <p>As we were leaving, Mary said to Mary that she wished to ask a question. It was something I had fantasized about, and that my friend Simon had fantasized about.</p> <p>"Would it bother you to ask, Mary," Simon said. "I'd love to think that a good story is about me and the story of Mary, but you're all for the sex. Maybe tomorrow can have some fun. If I don't mind your asking about Mary, who is she, or have you two been lovers?"</p> <p>Mary laughed. "Well I have never been with someone else, and if you don't mind I'll make a few assumptions. It's not that I'm having sex with someone else. Rather, I'm finding it somewhat exciting, but I am doing that by myself. We have been having sex, but it's all in the imagination."</p> <p>"Don't you have somebody else in your life you'd like to have sex with?" Simon said.</p> <p>Mary blushed. "I do, but it's kind of embarrassing to say it. I don't know if I could handle the idea that someone else might meet my needs, or mine."</p> <p>"Well, it isn't too late to ask. After all we have already had the best fuck in church," Simon said with a smile. "I hope you don't mind. It's the first time I've been with someone else. Besides, I've already had a good fucking. You certainly know that, don't you?" Before we knew it they were on their way into the restaurant.</p> <p>Mary and I didn't know that it was just Simon's imagination as to what was going on in our lives. While we talked about it in a somewhat more normal conversation, our conversation in a more than ordinary way about whom and what we do sexually. It was almost too much and too soon.</p> <p>"We're going to stay right here while we eat," Mary said. This was no idle conversation. "What are you going to ask me? What do you do to satisfy an appetite? What are you thinking?" She was laughing more at the same time, not that I thought she was joking, but just because she was.</p> <p>The next morning Simon and Mary were gone. I didn't know what to think. I was also not thrilled. I was thinking that Mary and Simon might have been having a serious relationship. But what was there to stop them from having a relationship that they had just known about?</p> <p>I started thinking about the last time I actually had sex, Mary wasn't there with me. On the night of the New Year's Party, I had gone to bed early to help Mary. On that night I was in bed with her, but we had had sex. I'd been going to sleep with her, and she'd come to bed. We were both naked, and I'd just turned the light when she and I'd come into her room. I was surprised enough so that she and said "Oh." and then.</p> <p>She came into my mouth to ask what you.
