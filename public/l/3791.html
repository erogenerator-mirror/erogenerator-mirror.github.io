Considerable freedom was allowed me, as Sola had informed me that so long as I did not attempt to leave the city I</strong> might have to stay for three or four hours to work.</p> <p>At least she and her sisters left town a week in advance.</p> <p>And that was where my dreams about to be turned away.</p> <p>I thought about how it would feel to have Sola's tongue and hands caressing my dick to heaven, how it would feel like her lips, mouth and pussy sucking it from every part of my body. It would also feel like having my dick slowly going back up in between her lips, then sliding into her warm, wet cunt.</p> <p>Well this is definitely not the place to do it, yet.</p> <p>The first chance of us had arrived was early the following morning. It would be hard not to have gone. For my part I could be on my back, her on top, fucking her pussy with my cock. For me, she would ride my dick, I would take her ass. There were a few times when I just sat up to find her straddling my dick until I went off. This was no exception.</p> <p>I'd heard of girls like her, but in normal conversation I had assumed that she would be a natural blonde; or at worst a brunette with a smallish potbelly. Or a blonde on black, or an Asian with blonde hair and skin tones that would be quite interesting to me in the next two months.</p> <p>But Sola was different. I'm not so sure she was a normal blonde. Maybe she wanted to be a blonde, that's why she had been all right since she and her sisters had arrived back home.</p> <p>It had been three whole days since I had seen her. I tried not to think about it.</p> <p>And the dream had ended.</p> <p>On a warm night during the winter, I awoke to my bedroom door closing as my father, mother and father slept at home.</p> <p>In my sleep, however...</p> <p>I had awoken some hours earlier to see my mother sitting at a small table in our shared dining room, with an absolutely radiant smile and a cheerful wave to her sister, who was standing behind her. For about half an hour I stared at the two in surprise and confusion.</p> <p>I was not very hungry or thirsty, but something about them seemed different. For a moment I realized that Sola must have just fallen asleep at the table, perhaps her father must be out of town for the day.</p> <p>I wanted to speak to her, to tell her everything, whatever happened, but somehow I refrained until her sister was once again sitting at her father's side.</p> <p>"Is Mother home?" I asked.</p> <p>Her mouth was slightly open, but no words emerged. Then she frowned, "I'm not really hungry."</p> <p>"Please say you're hungry."</p> <p>"I could always eat you..." She muttered, then blushed. Then she looked at both of us with a smile, "But I've got a special treat for you though."</p> <p>She leaned over and kissed me. I could feel my cock stirring beneath my sheets. I didn't know if I would be able to take much more of this before I had to go home to the mountains again.</p> <p>Her tongue pressed into my mouth, I held her body tight against mine, she smelled of soap and soap and her skin was surprisingly soft. I moaned as I felt her nipples brush against the side of my chest, against my cock. Her mouth parted, her breath hot and sensual against my open mouth. I didn't want to make her uncomfortable...</p> <p>"Oh yes!" She gasped, breaking the kiss just long enough for me to catch my breath. She smiled brightly at me as she continued to kiss me.</p> <p>Then she had her hand on my chest, rubbing my nipples, stroking them. She kissed me with fire.</p> <p>My dick responded. I felt a slight throb under my covers.</p> <p>I opened my eyes, catching a glimpse of her eyes as she looked into mine.</p> <p>I moved my hand to her thigh, up and down. To make a point I pulled up her nightshirt to my nose, to breathe in the musky scent of her skin and shampoo. My eyes moved down her body as she did the same to me. I saw her nipples poking out through her nightshirt against my touch.</p> <p>"Please," she whispered as my hand slid from her face, down her chest to her stomach, past her bellybutton and onto her mound, caressing her lips softly.</p> <p>She moaned as my fingers grazed over her slit.</p> <p>I pushed and parted her lips, letting my fingers slide inside, feeling her heat and her wetness. Slowly I slid them into her pussy, moving deeper and as she opened up and my fingers. Her slit. "v-m as if..."</p> <p></p> <p>She gasped, then she had a moment. I pushed my hard, in me moreâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
