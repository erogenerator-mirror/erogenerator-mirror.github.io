They are God's greatest lieutenants, because none of which have the power to make a man happy by fucking men.</p> <p>When men think you're fucking a woman, they don't believe they're fucking a woman. Men of our age have been making the world a brighter place, as have our fathers, who used to take the world into their hands like they were doing in our world. Those who've been doing that, and who are being fucked, will never be found again.</p> <p>It is not like that for men of our age. As an example, I know, from the stories, how, and who of our world, I've been fucking women. I am one of seven, and I'm not one of four men. It's easy to say it, too. We only fuck women if one of us is fucking a woman, or, if the other's woman is fucking us.</p> <p>We have two genders. Women are all for fucking other boys. She men's women are all for fucking a woman, if we'd like. We are all of the sex gods. Men of God are God's gods. Men of earth are God's gods too. The only thing God needs right now to be fucking him is a man.</p> <p>Men are for fucking other men's wives. Now that's not so easy. Women are for fucking with each other, only for sex. Women are for fucking men if we'd like.</p> <p>We must never be in the same room, fucking other men, unless we're in one of the men's rooms. If we are in one, it's just sex. Men are for fucking other men. Only women can fuck men with whom we don't know. Only men can fuck with each other, while they're not in the same room, either.</p> <p>Since you are a man, your name is Adam. Your story is Adam. Your story that is Adam, is Adam, Adam, Adam. Do you like it? Want to try it? Want to hear it? Want us to do it? Do you want to fuck someone else? Have your fucking stories come true? Want us to fuck you? Have our stories come true? You'll love my story, too. The way Adam said that to you, he's just using an old Greek word. I'm trying to be an example.</p> <p>My name is Amy, from England. I've got my own name, Amy, Amy, who I am, Amy, where I'm from in England. I'll write my own story here. But what a name to say of an English name! We are all born to the same name, because that's who we are. How many of you out there, just a handful of women out there that want a piece of Adam, who hasn't even fucked you yet?</p> <p>So, it's a story of where someone is, who we'd all like to fuck, and we'd all want to do it. If you'd like, you can have our names, if you'd like, if we'd like, if we'd want to have your names, and if we'd like, if we'd like, if we'd be of any age to have your names, and if we don't like it, you can sue me. My name doesn't mean anything anyway, as that is, the word on our faces.</p> <p>I've tried. I've tried but never succeeded. My name doesn't mean anything. Never. Adam wasn't Adam. He was Adam when he said I was Adam. I am the name that you used to ask me to stop fucking other men, when the only way I could stop fucking other men was saying Adam wasn't Adam.</p> <p>Adam isn't Adam now, when I'm Adam. I'm the name that you called back to me on our first tryst. Adam was Adam. I'd been Adam for several years. I don't know how many times Adam's fucked other women. There are too many of them, though, and they don't count. We have only just begun to fuck.</p> <p>I haven't even fucked Adam, yet. I've been inseminated by two other men, and there haven't been a single man's cock in my pussy. That's the thing. I didn't want to tell you that. I wanted to say that I had made an effort to fuck other men. I didn't want to tell you that. I was doing all of men, and having never again. I was. I was. I and then and I am now and now and I always. I'm now and I'm Adam. I'm Adam.<|><||> <|”—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
