I'm going to cum in my own hands again. Now get up and take off your clothes, and I'll cum inside you too; but I might be on top of you at the time, so you don't get an unwanted ejaculation as well. I'm getting you there.</p> <p>When you're naked, turn around and we could be intimate, which could be very stimulating. And then get my ass into you, right now!</p> <p>You want to suck my dick, so how may I?</p> <p>Good heavens! My God, you are the greatest ever! And the closest thing to heaven. Can't you wait until we go back to your place to consummate our love?</p> <p>No, I wait.</p> <p>Now get on your knees again.</p> <p>Your hands are trembling. I want to go faster, but I want you to wait until I cum in your mouth, so we can both cum at the same time. You'll never get me to cum in your mouth again, but you can wait. Now turn around like you will before I cum in your mouth.</p> <p>I could see the fear in your eyes. I can't hold back on that!</p> <p>Oh my God, that is so hot! I just wish you would just swallow me, before I cum in your mouth!</p> <p>I can wait, as long as you want. And when I'm ready, just lie down on the floor and spread your legs, so that I can enter you without any trouble.</p> <p>If it's not you, I've got a rubber in the duffle bag. Bring that inside the bag and put it there on your bed. I've got a condom ready to put on me too.</p> <p>I'm putting down the condom. I think we can do this at least, when you're ready.</p> <p>I'm going to use the lube on the condom, for my dick. I'm not going to wear a condom. I hope you'll still be wearing one when you go back to your house, because you'll be on our honeymoon together. It's going to be so exciting.</p> <p>When we're done, you can tell me all about your wonderful time together again. How it's your first experience, so you'll know the most wonderful sex life you've ever been on in your life.</p> <p>I think I can do that, at least until you need to tell me just how wonderful your love was. I was so anxious to tell you that I'm still saving that for another time, and probably several years. That is until someone else asks me to tell you how wonderful our time was in the park one day.</p> <p>I'm going to tell you just how exciting that first time was, and how I didn't think the passion of our sex life would be like this. I won't ever use the condom again. I'm pretty sure that I won't ever have to wear them.</p> <p>Now put your hand between your legs and masturbate. I know you want to do that, just as much as I do. I'm going to take my hand away and play with your nipple and your vulva.</p> <p>Okay.</p> <p>I'm going to insert the dildo, so that it will stay within your innermost being without any pain. You'll find it is smaller than your old one, or better, but it should still get in and out of you.</p> <p>It does get in and out, though, right before I come. When you're ready, get down on the bed, but do not touch your clitoris.</p> <p>I'm going to insert the dildo until I feel I've brought you to orgasm. Then I'm going to start it all over again.</p> <p>Do you want to tell me, what happened that first time?</p> <p>We were together for so long until you had to leave. You never saw my face. I guess you can tell by how excited you are when you feel your clitoris being rubbed at the base of the plastic cock. What you feel at that moment is intense pleasure.</p> <p>I'm going to remove the dildo and I want to feel my vagina close to you. I want to feel everything about the sensation that we have together.</p> <p>I've always wondered if I really wanted to do this; but I decided against it. I'm not a virgin, and I'm no expert at that.</p> <p>Now, we can use both our hands to explore the depths of your body where you feel the sensation first. You are an excellent lover and I'm getting your motor running again.</p> <p>Let me be your lover; please.</p> <p>Now tell me just wait until I'm inside you.</p> <p>I'm going to come.</p> <p>I'm going inside you and</p> <p>I'm your</p> <p>I'm going andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
