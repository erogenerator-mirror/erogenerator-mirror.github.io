JAMES HARTHOUSE</h4><p><strong>The Gradgrind party wanted assistance in cutting the throats of the Graces. They went about recruiting; and where could they enlist recruits more hopefully, than among the fine gentlemen who,</strong> a mere eighteen, now, had volunteered to be made their teachers? And why would they need to help?</p> <p>"Gentlemen," the headmaster of the Graces of The Academy of Magical Research, was standing in a line at the front of the line of teachers and students; and on the front of the line of a few other teachers and classmates, to the middle. "It is time for our first class, Miss Anderson."</p> <p>Two thousand and fifty students turned in to the lectern and began their lecture. The headmaster of the Academy, Mr. Vickers, would be presenting his first lecture in just less than two weeks; the first of his five years combined. Mr. Vickers was the Headmaster of the Academy, a school known for its diversity; and Mr. Vickers, a school who often looked at his classmates with disdain; made up of a dozen different races, all from different backgrounds; including, in his view, the very people of the English Academy.</p> <p>Professor Vickers had a sense of entitlement and power in his school, his own way of controlling the students and teaching them better than he had himself in this school. His school was now holding seven of its thousand, seven hundred twenty seven students, and it was time for his first lecture, the first of his five years combined.</p> <p>"Miss Anderson, it is about time for a real lesson."</p> <p>The Headmaster had no sooner stopped speaking, the class began to chant:</p> <p>'Oh, please, oh please, please...'</p> <p>He hated the idea of it. A lot. The students at the Academy knew better; who knows what happened to them, in the next school year. But none of that mattered in that moment. Mr. Vickers had been there for four years, and yet, every other day of each, he thought he'd be here, teaching, teaching and teaching, until his students started to come in to class, or to his office, or to home; and that thought made him smile. No, not smile.</p> <p>The Headmaster stood beside Mr. Vickers, who was seated in a chair, watching the class.</p> <p>He wasn't at all surprised when the Headmaster of the Academy, Mr. John Vickers, turned to face him. He'd often been the source of his students' fantasies. Mr. Vickers was always thinking about making love to a woman. Not a sexual relationship; just a sort of foreplay. And when he had gone home, Mr. Vickers often wondered what it would be like to make love to Mrs. Anderson. The Headmaster always knew that Mr. Vickers' fantasy was also real. So when the school's headmaster turned and smiled at him, and he was staring at him, Mr. Vickers wondered if he was imagining all that pleasure.</p> <p>The Headmaster was almost always the very next step to teaching. It was why he had gone to the Academy when he was the Headmaster's oldest son. This was because he was now just sixteen, and his life would take an eternity before being finished.</p> <p>The school secretary, Ms. Anderson, always got in trouble whenever she came to Mr. Vickers' office on a lazy Friday; and when Mrs. Vickers came to Mr. Vickers, as soon as they were alone, she would ask if anything was wrong. She would ask if Dr. Williams had forgotten about the Headmaster.</p> <p>When Mrs. Vickers was in Dr. Williams' office all the time, she would ask, "Could I help you with something?"</p> <p>Mr. Vickers would smile. He loved it when she showed him exactly what was on her mind. She said, "Are you feeling well?"</p> <p>The Headmaster felt his eyebrows rise. "Yes, yes, I just need to get a breath."</p> <p>The Headmaster, who was, of course, a very handsome man, always enjoyed smiling at Mr. Vickers. It was part of his job to impress the Headmaster. He didn't like to think about doing something wrong.</p> <p>Mr. Vickers smiled and said, "All for the teachers." He knew that when he was in Mr. Vickers' office, he would always get a kiss in return. He saw it as an endearment.</p> <p>So it would always be a thrill for Mr. Vickers to think how easy it would be for Mr. Vickers to walk into his office and sit on the armchair, with Mr. Vickers right there next to him. Then they would often kiss. And when he was in Mr. Vickers' office, especially when students were in attendance in Mr. Vickers' office, in Mr.</p> <p>But that night the Headmaster Vickers knew of course was a special to Mr. Vickers.</p> <p>And although it did Mr. the school was very special to him... when heâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
