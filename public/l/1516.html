English by Niccolò Machiavelli </h3><h4>LITERATURE AND DEATH — Aet. 43-58—1512-27</h4><p><strong>On the return of the Medici, Machiavelli, who for a few weeks had vainly hoped to retain his office under the new masters of Florence, was dismissed by decree dated</strong> one day.</p> <p>My fingers caressed gently over my lips, brushing against the tender flesh of my cheek. I could feel the heat of his shaft pressing against my inner thigh as my lips tentatively drew back from the tip of my tongue.</p> <p>Silently, he pulled me close, pressing his body hard into me, his throbbing cock forcing its way deep into my inner being.</p> <p>"Ah, yes," I whispered, closing my lips on his neck as I could feel his hands on my hips pressing me forward, pushing down against him, urging his hardness deeper and deeper inside.</p> <p>He groaned as he felt my hips thrust into his, urging him to fill me further.</p> <p>"You know you want it just the same," he gasped against my ear as he slipped his fingers inside my panties, feeling my arousal, stroking myself into readiness.</p> <p>"Oh, God..." I groaned, my thighs trembling as I felt his finger slide over my clit.</p> <p>"Do you want me to fuck you?" he panted against my ear as he used his free hand to pull my panties to one side.</p> <p>"Yes," I gasped as I felt him press his cock deeper against my slit, the tip pushing against my vagina and then driving inside.</p> <p>"Beg me," he demanded. I couldn't help but blush as he reached for my bra and quickly yanked it from my body.</p> <p>"Please," I gasped.</p> <p>"Beg me to fuck you," he added, lifting himself from me abruptly, pulling from my body suddenly. With a wicked grin, he pulled my panties aside and thrust himself into me again.</p> <p>He didn't even have to ask me to move my hips as I felt him move inside me. I pushed down hard against him, feeling his hard manhood, then felt my body responding.</p> <p>A few minutes went by, then he took his cock suddenly from inside me and positioned my legs over his shoulders.</p> <p>"Say it again."</p> <p>"Please fuck me." I gasped.</p> <p>"Beg me."</p> <p>"Please fuck my hot little cunt." He pulled me tight; his hard cock slid easily inside me.</p> <p>"Beg for more," he demanded. "Beg me to fuck you."</p> <p>"Please fuck me," I cried with pleasure as I felt his fingers slipping into my pussy again, then his hand.</p> <p>"Say it."</p> <p>I moaned softly as the soft touch of his fingers on my inner thigh, his hard cock inside me, sent delicious thrills through my whole body.</p> <p>"Please fuck me," I repeated softly, almost gasping. "Please fuck me."</p> <p>"Say it," he demanded.</p> <p>"Please fuck my hot little cunt," I cried softly. I felt the wet friction of his cock as it pushed deep inside me.</p> <p>"Say it."</p> <p>"Please fuck me," I moaned.</p> <p>"Say it, now." He tightened his grip on me, pushing himself deeper inside me while my body shivered with the pressure that built inside me as my legs pressed together. "Say it," he said again.</p> <p>"Please fuck my hot little cunt," I cried quietly.</p> <p>Then I was lost in a fog and I didn't care who heard me. He thrust deeper and deeper, feeling him inside, sliding smoothly inside me, driving deep into me and rubbing me against his hard, driving stiffness. I came again, my whole body shuddering to one huge orgasm that drove him into the next one.</p> <p>"God, yes," he gasped, pulling his penis from my body and collapsing onto my back once again. I could feel his body on mine and felt his hot cum oozing deep inside me as my own body convulsed and quaked beneath his while I came again and again, lost in the ecstasy of my pleasure.</p> <p>Finally, at last, he pulled himself from me. I lay there, my face covered in sweat.</p> <p>"You are truly an amazing fuck, I am sure. I'll be sure to thank my boss if he's anywhere near as good!"</p> <p>--</p> <p>I had only been home for two weeks when I was startled unexpectedly by the ringing of my telephone. I hurriedly checked my caller id and realized that I hadn't replied. I checked my caller history, then reached in to retrieve my caller ID.</p> <p>"Yes, I am here, but I forgot to answer the door," I answered quickly, almost apologetically. "What did you think of Tom's cock, when the opportunity presented itself?"</p> <p>"I liked it as Tom has made you feel so good," I answered, laughing as I quickly checked the Caller ID. "Mmmnndnndnndnndnndnndddd<."</p> <p>"And you also made me feel very good," I thought, thinking about you—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
