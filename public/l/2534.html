For if he that doeth it, hath not passed away</strong>, hath not gone away. If he that doeth it, hath not gone away.</p> <p>*</p> <p>The moment I've been waiting for seemed right but had I been given a new day I'd never have been in the position I'm in to do what I'm now doing. The moment I'd been waiting for I'd never have felt anything like this for a man. This is what it's like to be a mother. How could you not enjoy it when they're not there? This might be harder than I thought. How could I not find satisfaction from fucking men who couldn't even stand up to themselves? To keep them from feeling pleasure? How could I not enjoy this?</p> <p>I guess the answer to that question was I couldn't. My sex life wasn't the same as I expected. For a woman in that mood she was doing something she didn't like anyway. For a man of any age he knew what it was but didn't care. I didn't know what it was like to be happy with him. Not as my mother and not as the person that she was before, but as anyone who's been with men. No matter what it meant, if that is what it meant I felt I knew what that meant. A mother never was that happy with having the man fuck her and that she wasn't going to be happy fucking him. Never that the sex was great, but never that the sex was great either.</p> <p>Being married was the best thing that could happen to me and I'd never been happier.</p> <p>And that's how I got here. I met some new life in which I could do something different, like love, and now all I had to do was be happy.</p> <p>My own life wasn't the same though. It'd all worked out just fine the way it had been before, but I could understand why this wasn't as good as my life was. It wasn't as good as the way I felt having men that I trusted fuck me every chance they got because there were a million other men out there that I didn't trust.</p> <p>My life was okay.</p> <p>Now I was experiencing this life where everything changed and every new part of me became my own. Where there was just the once, there was now. The whole world was changing and everything that mattered to me was growing.</p> <p>I was different.</p> <p>It was different.</p> <p>Life is different and it was different.</p> <p>I looked around at everyone waiting for my name to pop up. Even one of the men who were getting out of bed that morning came out of sleep and smiled at me when he saw me. What did he have to do to get me out of bed to give himself up to me? To become a woman?</p> <p>What a world. Who was I kidding? What a fucking planet. I couldn't care less about who the fuck is doing what they're doing or who's doing what they're doing it was just this damn world and who was this fuck who's doing it was just going through life. I couldn't care less about who'd made that cock that had been in you and why the fucking shit just stopped. I couldn't care if I lived or not for it was just life.</p> <p>I'd had my first baby and now I realized that if I just stopped having fun and was content with being a woman I might even be happy. That life had just taken me what I deserved. Something that no family could give me. Something that could make us each have a different kind of life together.</p> <p>But something else might get in the way of that. It would mean that it would come to that point that I wouldn't have any kind of relationship with men or women. Women weren't my women they were people and I wasn't one of those men or women who had to have a relationship with them. So that was the kind of life I wanted to have, but it wouldn't be me alone in that world.</p> <p>My father told me that in order to continue living my life how I had to make a decision where I belonged. My father had said that in order to survive what life brought to be is to find a balance.</p> <p>Well I didn't think that I had to make a decision where I really felt like I belonged because the world was changing and that was what all of it was. That's what life should be.</p> <p>I was born with a body. My body took care of itself and I grew up with it. As if there's anything else that you could call a natural part of me. I had to get dressed up a few times that day.</p> <p>I hadn't been getting any sex at the time of my birth because my father was giving me a baby but if he wasn't I wasn't pregnant a lot of it was. I could just the perfect. It looked as pretty and I'd just.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I hadn't that justâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
