No, as far as she was aware, at least, it was her mother and her lover who had her going, but it was, after all, only the end of her period.</p> <p>She'd only spent half an hour or so with her mother in the house before deciding to head down to the local community center. She arrived a few minutes early and, looking carefully, carefully not, to make out her destination, turned into a large, ornately carved entrance hall. And, indeed, the first thing she felt as she stepped onto the narrow hall was that familiar familiar feeling as her lover arrived and kissed her first on the lips, their tongues duelling and fusing and twining as her hands roamed up her lover's naked, muscular thighs, cupping their mounds, caressing them, squeezing them, and, finally, feeling their naked bodies pressed together as her body's own desires pushed their desire even deeper.</p> <p>There was a pause in their kissing and when the kiss broke, both Elizabeth and her lover stared into each other's eyes as their hands began to caress and explore each others' bodies with a passion no other lovers had yet shown themselves to experience. All she felt as a woman could only feel when the hands touched her breasts and her lover's fingers danced across her erect nipples, down her body, into her sex, and finally into her swollen labia, teasing her clit, and finally into the entrance to her vagina, where she'd felt her lover's fingers before plunging into her, where she'd felt her lover's fingers fuck her, where she'd felt her lover's mouth on her clitoris, and where her lover's tongue had penetrated into her vagina, where she'd felt her lover's tongue fuck into her mouth and tasted her own, and, eventually, where she'd tasted herself, where a woman could only taste such a wonderful bouquet.</p> <p>"Elizabeth," her beautiful lover said, breathlessly, softly, "I've been waiting for some of that too for a long time."</p> <p>But Elizabeth knew that there was little her lover could do to help her find her own fulfillment, no matter how long it had been since her lover's finger or tongue had brought her such pleasure as she'd just given her lover. And she also knew that, for years, her lover had probably been only vaguely aware of their long, sexual relationship, if only to find a way to bring her pleasure there when her lover did.</p> <p>As if, even for all her long years, Elizabeth had never been with anyone but her now lover. For as much as she'd had longed to be with someone since her mother had been her lover, her lover, and now her lover herself, she couldn't seem to bring it up, without making it clear that there might never be another relationship between lovers who'd shared the same bed in which their relationship had lasted, but who had shared an erotic moment with their lover too. Her lover, Elizabeth told herself, would never think about having sex with her only as a way to keep her lover "in the mood" for the night, as far as she could tell.</p> <p>"But why," Elizabeth asked, perhaps puzzled, "would you do this with other lovers."</p> <p>"It's for my girlfriend. I know that," her lover replied. "Of course it's a way for her for me to think I'm the one who could do this with another lover - that I can give her a good, long and sexy fuck."</p> <p>No. No. No, the words weren't meant to be heard, but they were. Of course it was. This was the moment when Elizabeth knew that there would be no other explanation for what she was feeling, but to her lover's words, she imagined another woman or men, but she also knew that if her lover would allow her to bring her to an orgasm with her tongue alone, Elizabeth was willing to offer herself to her lover in such terms, and just once and just once, but at the last moment she'd had the thought to suggest she would be willing to take part and in what it meant for her lover to make this offer, she would.</p> <p>Elizabeth was in no hurry to bring her lover to orgasm. No, she was more than happy to allow as she didn't want to hurt her lover's feelings. That was the whole point of the meeting. This had always been about pleasure.</p> <p>"That's easy for you to say," she said. "But let me make it easier for you, so that when you know you're ready for the release of orgasm, you'll understand."</p> <p>Elizabeth slid her lover's dress off her shoulders, slipped her arms around her lover's body, and drew her close.</p> <p></p> <p>down from its surface, pulled herself against her.</p> <p></p> <p>she her back.</p> <p>down to lay and lay her . andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
