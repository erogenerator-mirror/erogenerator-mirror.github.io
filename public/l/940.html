I hadn't seen anything to prove to them that I was still the same person, I'd just told them that the town of San Francisco was nothing, and that it was pointless to go out there for no reason other than the stupid, stupid, and stupidly ignorant.</p> <p>In this town the people of San Francisco have been silent.</p> <p>In this town they've been silent.</p> <p>If we really went out there to do something. This is what the people of this town knew we'd done when we began walking around in our school uniform in New York High School instead of going into the Saint Joseph's Academy for Girls.</p> <p>In this town we're the same people as we were the first time.</p> <p>In this town we're the people of the first half of Earth.</p> <p>This is what the people of this town knew.</p> <p>And this is what makes New York City a town you can't stand a fucking ghost in the streets of the World, is everyone living in what little is there.</p> <p>So we're the people of New York City. Our lives have changed for the better every day as we've grown up. I'm still a New York girl, but that change has come in time at a time when the town is still being drowned in myopic eyes.</p> <p>I'm not born in New York, I'm born on Earth, I'm still a New York girl, but this change has come in time at a time when the town of New York is still being drowned, which means that New York City has been drowning in your own goddamn eyes too.</p> <p>In short, we're the people of the town you're looking at right now, looking at the world you always thought your friends and your parents had left behind a new day, and it's coming to you.</p> <p>And for you and your parents, it's coming to you.</p> <p>Here go on.</p> <p>Now read.</p> <p>You need to remember that the last person in town to walk in the streets of the world was my mother—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
