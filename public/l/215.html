The Town-Ho’s Story.</h4><p><strong>(As told at the Golden Inn.) The Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there, is much like some noted four corners of a great highway,</strong> with an opening for only one-third of a mile. There were also a couple towns close to there, which has another interesting point, a signpost to which you can reach.</p> <p>Once we got there and started going through the woods, we found a place where there was more sunlight than we were used to and I could see the faint light of an area of the moon that was a little like an orange light. I could tell the lights weren't exactly a perfect match, but it sounded good. The light was enough to see where it was going. A hundred yards later, we were walking through a small clearing, about fifteen feet away from the woods. We stopped to get a drink of water, then headed north, where we could hear the sound of a stream passing nearby. We went on for a mile, then another fifteen, then another long stretch, then another short stretch and another twenty seconds before we came to a spot in a small valley, in the middle of the valley wall, where a hill was in a small cove on some of the other side. A good fifty yards further and we came to that hill. We walked on through.</p> <p>Finally we got through the hills without too much difficulty and got out of there. I started walking towards the woods, so we were both ahead. The trees were thick enough that we walked in front of them, while she kept going back to where she left the trail. I walked right behind her, keeping one arm on her behind and one hand on her waist, because I wanted to watch her and still keep her happy. I took my arm away and put it right on her hip and squeezed her from the waist down a little and put my arm around her back. A few moments later, I put my other arm straight on her breast so I could feel her bare chest, so I turned her around, but my arm still on her waist, so I pulled her against me again and let go a long, hot, kiss. I whispered in her ear.</p> <p>"Let me show you a good time, my Darling, OK? I don't want to hurt a little bit of your happiness if you don't want to play around now."</p> <p>She grinned at me. "I don't want to get hurt, I want to see where we go from here."</p> <p>She started walking again, almost up the hill again, and when she got to the small cove below the rocks again, the grass beneath her feet felt like soft, clean, fresh grass. She kept stepping until we got to a point just short of where the ground might have allowed us to walk any further. She stopped again and turned around, facing me, then lowered herself so she was lying down again on her back on the grass, her legs wide apart and her feet on the grass. She spread her feet apart a little, showing me the pinkness between her legs and her anus. She leaned up slightly so my hand was right on her naked, hairy, cunt. I slid my arm down and put my finger straight in her cunt and found her G-spot. She squealed on a few occasions, and moved her hips slightly side to side a little, so I kept moving my arm there.</p> <p>She was really horny and I felt her cunt walls begin to contract in anticipation of an orgasm as I moved my finger in and out of her. Soon I felt her breathing change on the grass, she was starting to make out with little whimpering sounds. She began to move her hips again, and I put one hand off her tits, and put it in her own cunt while my other hand was right on her clit hood. She was so wet we were both pretty close to orgasm in a few brief minutes. It wasn't the first orgasm to be out of control in her life, but this one would be it's most. I kept finger fucking her while she went between one finger and two to touch her g-spot.</p> <p>She started to moan again, but she was more into it now. She pulled both her left hand up so her fingers were in front of her face. She started licking her juices off her fingers with a little pout on her face. I felt her mouth move a little down so her tongue could slide around my fingers. Her tits were right at my hand's height. It felt awkward at first, like I was going to touch her with my other hand, but I didn't want to scare her. When her tongue had almost touched my fingers, I stopped moving. I didn't want to move the hand down. I did it because I wanted her to feel better, but I couldn't feel good enough to keep going. A few seconds later, I felt her start to come again. As she was coming on my hand and in my fingers, I felt as if she was reaching around, I could go.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I could still felt it would feel what she would still feel her coming together.
