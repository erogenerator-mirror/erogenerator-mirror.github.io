She</strong> felt bad for that. Her husband was not a good provider but she had grown accustomed to the practice of his giving in return.</p> <p>The letter included a photo of her as a very tall, athletic redhead who had been the cheerleader in high school. She proudly displayed her hair in the most feminine of ways. Her smile and smile lines were just as striking.</p> <p>She looked to be just as sexy as they say.</p> <p>His cock stirred as he saw her from her high heels. He imagined her lying on the bench as it was a few feet away from where they often sat. Her legs were crossed and her hand was resting just above her knee. Her legs were crossed and there would be no reason for it to be. He loved it when she crossed her legs and it turned him on to see her naked with her legs open. He wondered if she had any pubic hair.</p> <p>It felt so empowering to be desired in such a fashion and show the appreciation of a woman who was not herself. It brought a sense of power to have sexual attraction to the woman you love.</p> <p>There was also a thrill that if she walked toward her husband without saying anything, he would become aroused and he would be able to fuck her without the shame of being caught and having sex.</p> <p>It made him think about fucking her more often than he would wish. He loved her so much, he wanted to make her happy. It made him want what she had to endure.</p> <p>Then there was his love interest. His wife was so sexy and her breasts were just as appealing and desirable as her husband's are.</p> <p>Now that he was certain he was bisexual, he fantasized about it more often. He wished he could get her a chance to do that.</p> <p>It would not be fair to say he had the perfect woman. He wasn't. He wouldn't be in such a position. He had to settle for her.</p> <p>As he imagined himself, he wondered if he should even consider fucking her. With that thought, he felt more than a little embarrassed at the prospect of cheating on his wife.</p> <p>There was one other thing missing for him to consider. He wanted her as hot and bothered as she was, the same way his fantasy fantasy turned him on as much as the fantasy fantasy did.</p> <p>"Are you ready to fuck her," he said, aloud. He knew he was. He had been fantasizing about fucking a young black man for weeks and was ready to fuck his daughter's best friend if she would make that happen.</p> <p>"Yes," she replied simply.</p> <p>"Then get on the table," he advised. He reached out his hand and pulled her down onto the table. He moved her butt towards him until his hard cock was pointing at her belly.</p> <p>In preparation to make his approach, they both took a deep breath and moved as close as they could to each other's bodies.</p> <p>As her butt touched his cock, he felt the electricity of physical contact that was almost instantaneous. His cock pulsated with sexual power.</p> <p>"You are so hot," he murmured. She gasped when she felt him slide his rigid cock into her pussy. It felt like a velvet glove as she spread herself wide.</p> <p>"Oh, god," she gasped as he entered her.</p> <p>"Is this the right place to start."</p> <p>"Oh, yeah."</p> <p>"Fuck me with your hard cock," she requested.</p> <p>"Yes," he said, still surprised by his own boldness.</p> <p>He slowly eased his cock into her as she let him. He savored every moment of each thrust. She was so warm and wet it was like she wanted to be fucked.</p> <p>"Can I talk to you in person?" he asked. He took his hand away from the table and turned his attention to his wife. Her lips moved but her voice was barely audible.</p> <p>"Yes," she answered nervously, not sounding thrilled by his question.</p> <p>"Will you come home with me?" He asked. He was nervous, afraid to admit to his sexual attraction to a married woman but his desire was greater.</p> <p>There was a knowing smile on her face. "We will need to go to the grocery store tomorrow," she answered.</p> <p>"So long as I'm okay to be naked with you," he thought.</p> <p>"Yes. Yes you can. You won't be disappointed," she said and she added, "I love you, you know."</p> <p>"I love you, too," he replied to the same reason. He was excited all over again. It occurred to him that he had just fucked his daughter's best friend. His cock was hard as a rock. He wanted her so badly.</p> <p>"That's fantastic," she replied, too, too, too, too. "I'm not quite so good."</p> <p></p> <p>A mutual friends have it occurred—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
