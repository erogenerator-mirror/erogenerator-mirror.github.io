She had not forgotten the rather disagreeable impression left upon her by their last interview; but she nevertheless</strong> had to ask the question.</p> <p>When Reisz went to fetch their coats, Edna took delight in the way her eyes lingered on Mademoiselle's hand when the man's hand was in the coat pocket of her own. Reisz took the opportunity to place his free hand on Edna's shoulder. The feel of his long fingers on her shoulder sent shiver down her spine. Her heart raced and her pulse raced.</p> <p>"Have you ever had a man's fingers on your nipples?" he asked.</p> <p>Edna's tongue feline-like and her tongue quivered. She shook her head.</p> <p>"A man's finger touches the end of your nipple. Feel your nipple stiffen a little. Feel it get warm," he continued.</p> <p>His hand moved slowly towards her breast. Edna looked down at what he was doing. A tingling ran up from her nipped to her clit, and spread throughout the whole length of her body. It took only a half second for each movement to bring those feelings back; from there they went back to her clit. When they did, she felt a wetness rush into her panties where the moisture was pooling over her cunt lips.</p> <p>"Does it excite you knowing that you have someone who touches your nipple and you feel a little, a little, excitement." He pulled the coat out from underneath her breast and brought his fingers down to her nipple.</p> <p>"Ahh," she sighed as he began to caress her nipple.</p> <p>"That's not the way to please a man," Edna thought. The pleasure of his touch made her feel a little aroused too.</p> <p>The fingers continued to move down to her other breast. When he had gotten to the nipple, he rolled his thumb and forefinger around it, and he massaged it gently with his fingertips. Edna's heart began to beat faster, and a low moaning emanated from her lips.</p> <p>"That feels wonderful, Edna,"</p> <p>He continued his caress as he let go of her nipple. He reached down with one free hand and held up the hem of her coat, which he lifted over her hips. As Edna lifted her arms to let the coat fall it came to rest on her shoulder. He brought his hand down and cupped the warm, wet cleft of her naked buttock.</p> <p>Edna shivered at the way his strong hands felt on her bare, naked flesh. The feeling of his hands on her skin caused her to arch her back. She turned sideways on the sofa's edge. Her legs remained spread and her pussy lips were swollen.</p> <p>She heard his voice, but only he could hear her. "Tell me more about your work. Do you wear the kind of dress that makes those boys at work look twice. The type of high heels, the way you look at men and they can't wait to kiss you at the restaurant. Do you look sexy when you dance. Do you know whether you are the kind of guy who lets a girl dance, can you dance, can you do a slow, sensuously, romantic dance?"</p> <p>Edna was so caught up in the moment of her self-dare that she failed to answer this. Then he repeated it over and over to her.</p> <p>"Yes, I like when the boys look at you, but I can't quite see them yet. Do you mind if they feel your breasts?"</p> <p>"Oh, not at all. Would you like to see my nipples hard. Oh, would you like to see how hard I get when I walk."</p> <p>"I can't believe I'm even considering this,"</p> <p>Edna couldn't believe that a man could actually watch her being a naughty boy. Of course, if a man wanted to, he could touch her, but she couldn't have that. She had to ask about him.</p> <p>"I'm not a boy. I'm doing what girls need. I'm not going to try to seduce you. I'm going to seduce you."</p> <p>Edna wanted to say something, but the words she spoke were too halting. A smile crossed her face. "Is that what you want? That feeling of wanting to please, of being pleased by you?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"That's a wonderful feeling. I'll be sure to say anything about it. I love you. Please, tell me more."</p> <p>Edna reached down and caressed his chest with her hands. She began to caress his muscled body and he responded by pressing her to him. She lowered her head and she kissed him. She pulled back and looked into his eyes. But not being able to tell her words. Now she did she just kissed him.</p> <p></p> <p>she opened her mouth and her tongue touched his face and then she touched his lips and had kissed him. His.
