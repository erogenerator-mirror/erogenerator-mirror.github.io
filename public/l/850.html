He had suffered it there for more than a</strong> century, but never with a new one added to his life. Never would anyone be willing to remove the apple that would be hanging in the sun for him to look at anytime soon.</p> <p>He was lying on his back, gazing at the stars when his wife's body rolled over his. He wanted to see her again but couldn't because they had no intention of making love again. They only intended to have fun together, with a lot of fun. However, they had already made sure of that.</p> <p>His heart hammered in his chest. He'd already imagined seeing those perfect curves of heaven again so soon, but it was already time to start putting his plan into proper operation.</p> <p>He kissed his wife's hair and face gently before pulling away from his bed, leaving a trail of saliva on her lips.</p> <p>"We can start by having sex..."</p> <p>He whispered into her ear, the only response in reply.</p> <p>"I'm ready," she responded, smiling.</p> <p>He watched her as she shed the rest of her clothes and climbed into his bed. Her tits were bigger than he remembered and he imagined the weight of them would be enough to have him cum in his bed.</p> <p>His stomach tingled as he pulled the sheets up around him, giving Gregor an inside view that he probably would never forget. He would probably do whatever he needed to.</p> <p>He rolled on top of his wife the first time he had sex with her, as he was sure that the first few times in future were the same. He felt her legs wrap around him, her tits pressed against his chest. The heat of her body made him weak and he would have kissed her deeply if it were not for the fact that he couldn't move his legs at all.</p> <p>He lay on top of his wife, their bodies pressed together as he caressed her body and he whispered in her ear.</p> <p>"I'm ready," he said.</p> <p>"Good," she replied. "I want you to fuck me again."</p> <p>He could feel his cock responding, growing stronger as he felt her legs wrap around him.</p> <p>It was the same thing on top of him. She was the tightest thing he'd ever felt. She was also the one who'd been teasing him for years. He was more than ready to do her.</p> <p>With a grunt, he drove his cock into her.</p> <p>"Oh honey," he whispered as he pounded into her. He knew that she felt tight around him, but he wasn't in control. This woman was as much his wife as she was for him.</p> <p>The second his cock was in her, she cried out. She wrapped her arms around his torso and hung his face to hers as they kissed. Their tongues danced together until they were both gasping for breath and he couldn't take it anymore.</p> <p>His hips began to thrust into her, forcing his cock into her wet passage as his cock exploded in orgasm.</p> <p>His climax seemed to go on for an eternity. He felt the juices of both of them, coating both his cock and her cunt, before they melted together.</p> <p>A few minutes later, he rolled off of her, his mind a swirl of pleasure, before he saw the familiar light above their windows. He turned around, staring into the light of the city.</p> <p>"Wow, just incredible," he whispered. "So... what's the next step?"</p> <p>She smiled. "Let's wait for the storm to settle. We'll take some pictures," she said. "You want me to pose?"</p> <p>He nodded. She'd always wanted to do that, so he had a plan.</p> <p>"Are you sure I'll be comfortable with the photography?"</p> <p>"Of course," he said, lying next to her. "I can't imagine wanting any camera that I don't love."</p> <p>He felt her hand slip between her legs, her fingers playing inside of her pussy.</p> <p>"I hope this doesn't mean anything to you," he said.</p> <p>"Hush honey, it doesn't." With a grin, she slipped from his bed and went down the stairs. She had to look good.</p> <p>Gregor watched him get his picture taken.</p> <p>"Come to my room, so we can stay close to each other," she said. "You just have to tell me to stop."</p> <p>Gregor had already figured out the game by now. He had to pretend he wasn't upset about going to bed with a beautiful woman, but he couldn't just play along.</p> <p>"Let's wait," he said. "We don't have to wait for a few hours."</p> <p>"I know," she grinned. I'll need some water. I can't wait," he thought he said.</p> <p></p> <p>He couldn't wait for her to make me...</p> <p>not her.
