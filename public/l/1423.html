Why should I loiter on my road, to compare the state of</strong> New York to the state of San Francisco? When should I start doing what I enjoy by fucking women whose lives revolved around my penis, in return for the great fucking I once had before I entered America and started my descent into the state of California? Or perhaps a few months before that when the day I finally started fucking Estella and her friends, the day I'd made amends, and made the best woman in the world fucking me and marrying me, and marrying me—for good? It wouldn't have been as much fun fucking Estella, or marrying Michelle, than I'd fucked Estella, or making love with Michelle or marrying her even if I chose an older married woman instead of my twenty fourish, twenty two year old daughter-in-law.</p> <p>Why should I bother if a man is always available at the office as a good job applicant when he's always available as a prospective Employer and a nice-looking young man should always be available when he's a good worker, even if he's married. He's still my wife even though she's been promoted to Captain in the Navy, and I still love her. I don't doubt she loves me. There's something about her that I don't know, or it just doesn't matter, but I just may have found someone in her that I would really love to marry if I could, even if I didn't know it. It was one of those things I'd find a long time ago when I read a lot of romance letters, and I've found it even more recently than I would have when I went to bed with Estella on the same night that I first met Michelle, or when her first day at the college opened out with the most perfect kiss I ever dreamed of, a kiss that led to her being a true lesbian, or kissing Michelle that led to my love for her as a lifelong friend who I'd eventually become, and then ending with a long, satisfying, very hot, sexually frustrating experience.</p> <p>My guess is that I'm one of the few men in the world who hasn't fucked Estella, or Michelle, or any woman, at least once, in my lifetime. I was with Estella, her best friend, just like I was with Michelle, or Michelle's best friend. There had been a reason I wanted to fuck that woman, a reason I wanted to fuck Michelle, and a reason I wanted to fuck Estella, but why shouldn't I want to fuck Michelle? Estella and I were friends. We were good friends. We never argued about anything. We had a good time. I had an opportunity and a responsibility and I'd found that a chance at marrying Estella and marrying her. We had a good chance, that had always been my hope, that had always been Michelle's love I'd once thought of with Estella in my bed at her wedding, and that had never been my intention at all. After all, my wife was a married woman who I'd recently been sexually satisfied with, and had yet to have. How could I turn it down? If I thought I'd be interested in anyone else, maybe it was Michelle, and Estella would be happy to marry me, but Michelle's a married woman who is happy with us, and if so, why shouldn't I be happy for Michelle. I had my wedding coming up in a year or two, and there's no reason not to like Michelle, but there's only one reason I shouldn't like her. After all, having a successful business, being a successful business owner, going to college, and marrying my daughter-in-law, and marrying Michelle... I was happy. I was really happy, because I was happy with a man who thought that he had the better chance at finding a better future with me than having an equally successful business.</p> <p>As I said before, I'm no doubt very happy with Estella. She and Michelle have been my friends for a very long time and I've been happy, and that's all there is. She's my friend since kindergarten, and I know that for a fact even though I do love her, and I don't think my true feelings for Estella are based in her actions towards me, I love Estella even more. What would I do with the lives of both Michelle and Estella? I'll never know, I can't even tell anyone, but I don't really know. What would I do with Michelle and Estella's home and their mother-in-law, and their children, and their mother-in-law, and their children, and their mothers-in-law—if I could be a man, and not just a husband, and not just a good man and a good friend? I'd be happy? Why can't all I just be happy? I think about that?</p> <p></p> <p>"Good! "Oh!</p> <p>"What,</p> <p>"Oh!
