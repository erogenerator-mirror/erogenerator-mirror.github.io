I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of</strong> the window. There was no one around here so I went down the stairs into the lobby where I found an old janitor's closet. He was just sitting in that corner holding two of some kind of tool. He looked up at me and smirked at me and then I saw it was the guy who was wearing the pants to work. I was a lucky guy he had it.</p> <p>I walked up to the man and introduced myself. We talked for about 3 hours, and then decided to head on to the bathroom. We turned on the radio, and found the same one we were going to play. It was a compilation of songs Of A Man Who Likes to Cum and some pretty basic stuff on the radio.</p> <p>We sat on the bathroom sink and began kissing. We would break our kiss briefly and then we would start kissing anew. Soon we were making out again, our tongues and lips entwined. I felt my cock get harder and my pussy become more moist.</p> <p>We started kissing like wild animals. I sucked on his sweet tasting lips, running my tongue up and down them. Finally, I started sucking on his full upper lip, biting it lightly. Then, I started licking his whole bottom lip before I opened his mouth and placed my tongue inside. It seemed odd but I did it. I licked around for a bit.</p> <p>When I pulled my tongue out of his mouth and looked down, he was smiling. He was a sweetheart, a great kisser. He started rubbing my hard cock against his leg.</p> <p>"Oh you've grown a little, haven't you buddy?" He asked.</p> <p>Before I had a chance to answer, suddenly we were on the sinks toilet, and he started kissing the whole of my upper lip. I was very aroused. I was getting really excited watching him kiss me as we were making out again. He pulled me down to him and kissed me again, his tongue dancing against mine.</p> <p>I felt so hot all over, I wanted him badly. I pulled his zipper down and freed his massive cock. It was sticking out at nearly 6 inches. I couldn't wait any longer and immediately took it into my hungry mouth. It felt amazing, I could feel my tongue sliding up and down it every time. Soon I had it deep in my throat. It was warm and soft, almost as if it were a toy that I would play with everyday. My head began bobbing up and down slowly at first but soon my movements became quicker. I felt my balls being massaged, my whole body began shaking. After about 10 minutes of sucking him I felt him tighten up. He filled my mouth with his huge load of hot cum. I swallowed what I could but some of it spilled out the corners my mouth and trickled down my arm.</p> <p>As he let out an audible moan we were kissing some more. I pulled back slightly to look at him, I was covered with a few drops of cum but he wasn't satisfied yet.</p> <p>"You don't have to swallow it all," he said looking down.</p> <p>He got behind me and spread my legs. I felt his hands roaming all over my body from my shoulders to my cock. I felt his fingers running through my moist pubic hair. I felt his fingers brushing my thighs as he stood up slowly and pushed my legs apart. His cock rested between my thighs, his balls on my ass.</p> <p>I felt so vulnerable and so incredibly turned on, and he wanted to fuck me. It was very dark in the bathroom but even though it was very hot, I felt so hot and horny. We stood up, I looked around as I felt his soft dick sticking out from between my thighs, my dick rock hard in my pants.</p> <p>"Your pussy is wet," he said taking a step forward.</p> <p>I couldn't believe I actually had made a move. I thought he was going to take me right there. I felt him get the soap and the shower was right next to us. I felt his hands rubbing up and down my ass crack, making me feel really naughty. He even used the soap to lather up his dick, making me feel good too. I was completely horny, there was no turning back for me.</p> <p>"Turn around!" he said as he continued to rub his dick up and down my backside until I was completely turned around. "Do you want this cock inside you?"</p> <p>"Oh yes," I replied taking my hands and spreading my butt cheeks.</p> <p>"That's right, let me put that big thing in you," he said as he aimed his cock at the tip against my pussy.</p> <p></p> <p>"This is gonna feel amazing," I thought I said.</p> <p>" I thought he pushed forward, you just let go," I looked down on my head and put my backside. I pushed back.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>" I pushed—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
