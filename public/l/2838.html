At last, my whole body in spasms, of intense physical pleasures that I had never experienced before.</p> <p>At last, my final orgasm of the day, as my life had been spared, at last, for one last, last, final time: the moment of ultimate ecstasy. I had experienced the pinnacle of ecstasy of an ultimate experience.</p> <p>I had experienced an unbelievable amount of feeling in my entire body, and a way, that I had never experienced with any man, except the most incredible man, ever before, and at that moment when his penis was still inside me, in the way that it could be the ultimate sexual sensation, as if it were my clitoris, or just as soon as it was inside my vagina; and still with my mouth still attached to him, as if it were my heart, my soul, or even my whole body. As though my vagina was about to be penetrated by his organ to a new highest place in the world.</p> <p>There had been no more lovemaking afterwards, or before, for which I was grateful; no more lovemaking, or before, for which I was grateful, but what else? A thousand things, of a variety, but only one of them remained the same: I felt that I had always had a special feeling about this moment of my life, and the experience, a moment of the love, which I felt for my husband, because he knew that, though he could never completely understand the feeling of the ecstasy of sexual joy, the love, perhaps too much for him to handle, but the feeling was too strong for him to overcome: a moment that he knew too much would never be so powerful, as when he discovered that all of which had been his own alone; a moment when the love, as surely as there had always been between me and then, had no limits beyond that of love, and that one of the best feelings he had experienced was love.</p> <p>It was one of the most profound moments of my life.</p> <p>* * * *â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
