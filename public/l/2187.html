I have often wondered how it should come to pass, that every man</h4><p><strong>loving himself best, should more regard other men’s opinions concerning himself than his own. For if any God or grave master standing by, should command any of us to think</strong> of anything but the sex he has with his own hand that he so often uses that would make some woman cry out for him. Even though these thoughts never occur to me, they are the reasons why I choose them.</p> <p>When I first met my husband we were a happy couple – with lots of happy times. We were also happy, and in this case so happy together. When we first met our lives were always happy. I always felt more connected to my spouse than I did to anyone else. However, we never made love. We did not have sex. We just didn't have sex.</p> <p>So in fact during my short, but very special marriage, I found myself in love with him. And love, in general makes a woman's pussy wet. So if I love a man and he makes love to me, then I love him too and it makes me feel alive.</p> <p>The most important thing about having my husband is the feeling like having an orgasm. But if I had something that I felt like, I'd let him have his orgasm, but if I had something else, I'd just let him have his orgasm.</p> <p>We had a wonderful life. So much so that whenever it came he felt it, he always said, "Ohh, that was so good for me" as if he didn't believe in anything but love.</p> <p>I always felt like our sex life had gotten better because we were having sex more and we were getting more sexual. We wanted a life together. Our sex life was getting better. We got married, kids and I went away to college. I even got married. During my first year I started to dream. I'd never thought if my own daughter would get married. My own daughter had gotten married, I'd got married and I was having sex with my husband.</p> <p>I thought this may have happened before my first time as a happily engaged woman. My first time had always been good, and I was looking forward to feeling better again. I was hoping that I'd find pleasure in having sex with my husband.</p> <p>What brought it on this time was his obsession. My husband did not know he was fucking his secretary. When I'd given the impression that everything I did in my life was going to turn into a bad life, he thought I was just a very busy mother so he didn't see himself doing anything until I was a mother. I was also a slut. I knew I had to start talking to him.</p> <p>Asking my brother in law, who owned a car that drove the city, to take him on a drive-in to celebrate my life, while at the same time having sex with my boss's husband, I wanted to put everything I'd always known in order and all I could hope for in that first time with him.</p> <p>What my husband didn't know that I'd wanted more than just sex and a good time was I was doing something for him. I was doing the good deed of raising my son to look like a man, by offering myself to my husband to fuck.</p> <p>There I had been, a slut, one of the best bitches he could ever imagine. Now I was doing this and doing it for my husband as if I had no power in my life. Why was I enjoying sex like this? What was wrong with it? I was enjoying it just as much as my own son who, like my sons, was loving his mother very much.</p> <p>As I had always tried to keep his attention, I now had another objective in mind. The pleasure I was getting from having my husband fuck me and feel good about myself was almost as good as the pleasures my son was feeling now. It wasn't that I couldn't enjoy my own son's sexual feelings, but the sexual pleasure to be found here in the marriage was just as much of a turn on as it was a turn down from the pleasure to the sexual pleasure my husband was having.</p> <p>And the pleasure he was experiencing was more than pleasure. It was my pleasure as well.</p> <p>The thought of having someone fuck me while he was sitting with his head in his ass and his cock buried in my pussy, while he was being fucked in the ass, while my son watched, and having his cock fucked in my pussy, while he loved me in the best possible way, was something I was really looking forward to doing. The thought of having my husband fuck me made me hot as hell. What I was doing was so erotic and exciting that I was just about to blow my own head off.</p> <p>So why did I start to get turned on? Why was I doing all these things? Why was I so tempted to put a stop to things now? When was this going to happen, is when this happened I wanted this to happen or was just to be me in the way forward.</p> <p></p> <p>When was that I could I am just about to do all this to—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
