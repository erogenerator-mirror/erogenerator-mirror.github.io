Now, instead of going to the beach on the beach where I could see the stars and hear the breeze blowing up the trees and birds in the nearby bushes; I was making do with the sea.</p> <p>For two years now, I've been enjoying the sea. It's been relaxing, it's a lovely place when people are working and when I'm looking for something fun. Even out of the world; I've found this sea to be a little too relaxing to keep up with; though at times I've even made long dives in it.</p> <p>I'd just started thinking about it when I suddenly felt the tide washing over and my eyes rolled up. Suddenly I was naked, and I was on the shore. In a blink, my head was clear and I was back on my hands and knees, but not on my shoulders, instead, I was squatting over a huge, dark man.</p> <p>I glanced down, and his penis was already hard. There was a look of surprise on my face, as I felt my legs suddenly part as if of they might be of water.</p> <p>I looked up at him quickly and gasped. His big face was almost a mask of surprise, and the expression on his face was enough to shock me. We stared at each other for a moment, then he looked down at me and spoke slowly.</p> <p>It suddenly hit me that there could be no other way for me to feel this as if there could be no other way to feel this. I wasn't in love with the man; it was just a job that my parents had done. It came from an old movie, which I could remember and see and never forget: 'The Great Ingrid Bergman is a good actress, and her character is one of the most memorable ones I have seen.'</p> <p>It had been my father.</p> <p>And I was a married woman, not just a housewife, an independent woman, which was my life.</p> <p>But the man was a man of large, dark, brown eyes, dark hair in his face, and an ass that was big; so great that he could lift women easily if he wished. He didn't look a hundred and fifty years old, but he didn't look a day over forty-five, and while he didn't appear as though he were the young man from the movies, he could easily be the older man, and he would be the young man of his choice at any given time. Or he could have said, "There's plenty of room for a dozen," but he couldn't; his hips were small, and his cock was long and hard.</p> <p>Even though I was still a married woman; my heart swelled at my first thought that I would feel pleasure in any sort of physical contact with this man's body. I could only hope that he'd love me.</p> <p>I felt my body shaking as a huge wave of excitement burst through me. I closed my eyes, threw my head back, and screamed. The man could have knocked me over with a fist and I wouldn't have been able to have screamed out. The feeling that started in my nipples and raced in the rest of my abdomen was a powerful, sexual feeling that started in my toes, and it spread up and deep into my body.</p> <p>Somehow, my body was so weak, that I couldn't move. Not even as a child, since I hadn't had anything to eat; only a couple of cans in the freezer. I hadn't eaten much, and in fact I had no idea why; I felt like eating, not just walking through the house, which I'd do whenever I was alone, and even though I did enjoy it, most of the time, I felt like eating alone, even though the thought of my own mother ate at me, too.</p> <p>My fingers were at first on my breasts, then I found the nipple underneath, and pulled on it softly. The wave I was feeling was still strong even as I had an enormous wave of emotion in my chest, and I'd rather that the waves of a strong orgasmic feeling in my stomach and legs than having my daughter's mother feel pleasure in her touch.</p> <p>Finally, it was over, and I was lying still on the shore of the sea, while I gazed at the man's perfect body lying on top of me. His cock was standing out straight, not even reaching for me at first, and I could not see it because of the moonlight, though I had to blink to see that.</p> <p>With a gasp of fear, I opened my eyes, and looked down at his cock. My breath caught the huge rod between my breasts and I could only inches away from my face. I could see it.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>A big beautiful—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
