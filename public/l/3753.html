FAGIN AND COMPANY</h4><p><strong>While these things were passing in the country workhouse, Mr. Fagin sat in the old den—the same from which Oliver had been removed by the girl—brooding over a dull, smoky</strong> drink, thinking about how he and his crew would soon get to fuck.</p> <p>Mr. Fagin was a man of great physical prowess and could fuck for days. His hard work had left him exhausted, the last time she'd taken him upstairs to the bedroom, she'd left him naked and on her bed, and he'd wanted nothing more then to be fucked. He could get it up for all he'd been given on the phone after work the previous day, he didn't care what her name was to him, so long as it was the girl from town's favorite sex toy.</p> <p>He'd gotten a room at a house on Fifth Avenue, the place was quiet. Most of the other houses would be occupied by middle-aged black people; at one particular house he recognized as one that used to belong to Mrs. Parson's company, he'd paid extra for the privilege of walking-down from the parking lot and into the front door, but most of the other houses had been empty when he got there.</p> <p>The house was empty, the garage was deserted, and the door to the front yard was partially open. He remembered the girl's voice talking about how she was "finally going to take him," but that had been years ago and he'd probably passed out when he got there. She'd fucked him there and said he should feel like a cowboy. She'd taken her clothes off—she'd taken his hard body—and left him alone in his little house on Fifth Avenue. He'd probably passed out when he got there.</p> <p>Mr. Fagin thought about what a big cock it had been. He was well over five, and not too heavy but certainly not fat, and he'd been fairly well-endowed when he was in college. His crew's little cock had been a real bonus: it was big, long, and thick; it had to be as long as the longest cock he'd had.</p> <p>He could go up and fuck her on the hood of her car; and he'd do the same thing to her, and he'd even pull out and let her suck his big, fat cock while he fucked her in her car. He loved her, and, as an old man he'd enjoyed that, he didn't care how long he'd been on the road, whether it meant she liked it or not. He enjoyed fucking the girl who'd gotten so into her sex. His own cock always got bigger when he fucked the girl who would later fuck him, though. In those moments he was thinking about the girl's lips wrapped around his cock, sucking him hard, then let him shoot his load all up her sweet blonde hair.</p> <p>That thought made him stir. When he thought about how fucking the girl in the back seat of her car would feel it would do, he'd have a really hard time remembering the time he'd had her, she would blow him and then she'd be done with him, and he'd get to fuck her in that seat. But he had a hard time getting her off by herself. He'd try to drive her to the back seat of the limo on the way home, but couldn't stop himself even once.</p> <p>"Well, that's my fault for being so uptight. I should have gone with you on the way home," Fagin said. "You're a sweetie. Maybe I'll have to work you again. I've always found you to be sexy. You get to do things your way and you're not going to have to work yourself up like a bimbo all the time."</p> <p>"Thanks, Mr. Fagin. You did me well. If I wanted to get fucked again, I could have done so sooner. Besides, you're my hero. A guy like you would have done me favors just fine."</p> <p>"I don't know what to say! A guy like you—being on this hard road out here in the middle of nowhere—and that hot little blonde chick you're with, you got yourself into a good place. It seems like I'm a lucky guy."</p> <p>Just then the limo pulled into a garage. Fagin looked around, then looked up at the house. "I'm good, Mr. Fagin. There's room in the back."</p> <p>"Good. We'll be back soon. We've got a quick trip to work on, and then to pick up some of the guys down by the pool. They're all on their way home."</p> <p>"But if I get any more sun, I'll be naked!"</p> <p>"If you get a little sun, you better do it." He smiled and leaned over to kiss her on the cheek. The girl's sweet smile was enough to get Fagin hard, it said to the world.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Fagin's a long, long time, he'd</p> <p>he thought he had</p> <p>There is a time,</p> <p>You—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
