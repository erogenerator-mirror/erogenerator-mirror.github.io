Capitall, is the Infliction of Death; and that either simply, or with torment. Lesse than Capitall, are Stripes, Wounds, Chains,</strong> Nails, Or Tattoos. And that in these cases, is also the Drowsiness. It is a lot of times when you ask someone to do something that you can't stand, and they are very well informed. Even when you are fucking an infertile, you can easily tell that they have a big cock. (I say, "and" when you ask another to do something it is a good assumption. If your lover is a big cock you are more apt to know this, and not take it on a sexual high.) And, there are only a few others out there who can do that, as long as they are a good lover. The problem is, most of the ones you do fuck are just that!</p> <p>The first of these, was the night I was fucking a friend of mine in the parking lot. I got home to find a bottle of white wine, two glasses, and a bottle of wine, all lying on the couch. I knew it would be difficult for me because I was totally in love with my wife; and, as you know, there is a lot of emotional stuff involved in sex. So, I grabbed a couple of bottles, and turned the lights down. I sat down on the couch and opened a bottle.</p> <p>At this point you want to know, is this really true? No! This is not the first time she would cheat on me. The last time she had me in the presence of another, she told me that she had a boyfriend. It's an affair, isn't it? Well, this relationship is not a sexual affair. It is a relationship that she will not, and will not, tell her lover that she is an unfaithful woman. Not that I was complaining, I was only jealous that she was cheating! Well, she cheated, and we live on a side street, where it doesn't matter what name you put in it after she fucks someone that she was sleeping with, and I do love her and it's ok with me! It's not like I gave it a name anymore either. Just like it wasn't mine.</p> <p>Anyway, while we were drinking this wine it happened. One of the friends from high school would get home from school around noon, and she was pissed, so I had to get back to the house after I went to work the next day. At the time, I can remember thinking, I wonder what my wife would think of this. Did I know what my wife was thinking about it? I also thought that I might be able to guess. I don't know. But, there was a certain level of excitement that I felt the whole evening. And, I guess, there's a part of her that loves being in love with me all along. So, with those thoughts I made my way downstairs to the kitchen where I was pouring another one while the two women were having coffee and discussing how they would handle it. I put the wine down, leaned back, and started to watch the people that are going to be fucking each other later on. I could see the expressions of a couple's faces as they watched me. The looks of pure lust in their eyes were intense.</p> <p>I knew I was being watched; I knew she knew I was watching. I saw her fingers go into her mouth as she started to unbutton her blouse, then she reached behind her back and unzip her skirt as it fell to the floor. I was sitting there watching the last few minutes as her skirt fell back over her hips as her black satin thong dropped to her feet. She has very full, round ass cheeks that are completely tan and very firm. I could see her dark red pubic hair beginning to darken as her thong got tossed aside as she started to slide the matching black thong off her lovely legs.</p> <p>Her bare ass was perfect for me; I had made sure of that when the night before. Her black high heels, which she was now sitting on, made her legs look longer than they should. It was nice to note that the shoes were also black; I would have bet that her feet were as black as her skin color.</p> <p>I knew that watching her was turning my wife on; I could see the moisture starting to seep through her thong as I watched. This was turning my wife on; I could see how aroused she was getting, and also how aroused she was getting by the anticipation of what was going to happen.</p> <p>She reached back for the zipper of her skirt, unzipped it, removed it over her hip and took it off. I noticed that she had pulled her panties down to her ankles now, and had stepped them off herself. I noticed that her feet were not as tan as much as they appeared. I remembered from before, but longer and very tan with tan to cover her ankles, with tan toes which sheer toes; these nails.</p> <p></p> <p>feet.
