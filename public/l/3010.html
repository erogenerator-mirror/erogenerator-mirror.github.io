"Whosoever speaketh a word against the Sonne</strong>, shall be punished, Matthew 23.18. "So for the righteous heart, it beeth right in God is thy hand that is to cast thee not unto His Name, John.</p> <p>Now he was to fuck the sonne by the hand. To fuck and suck and lick. And to feel the love of god, and to fuck his wife, that are the things she's loved best, that he's given, which would bring him peace between thee'nd. And, she could do no wrong with him, and he would not. She can't. She couldn't do nothing wrong. But if she'd done anything wrong, then he would be in for it. To him. To his wife, the Holy Mother of his son, and God who would deliver him to a world of eternal love and forgiveness, or a world of eternal sin.</p> <p>He kissed his wife's neck, his mouth, all over the sensitive flesh of her neck, and she gasped at first:</p> <p>"Oh my God! That felt so good. Take me, my husband. Take me, Matthew 23.9. And then take his tongue. Yes, that is what God has done!"</p> <p>He kissed her again, and this time he let her mouth do its work, and he entered her, gently, gently, to have some control left over the lust and longing that had developed. She was so warm, so wet, so accommodating, he slipped himself into the embrace with her as deeply as he could, and she moaned:</p> <p>"Oh, God! Ohhhhh, Matthew!" and he did, too, kissing her lips and tongue and face and neck as deeply as he could. When he came, she sighed, and he came too, both of them moaning in contentment.</p> <p>The moment passed, and they lay there, naked, breathing in each other's faces, just one-inch apart, just touching. They smiled; neither of them had ever known the love they had for each other so dearly, nor the joy they had given, neither had ever known it so much as they now felt for each other, that they would always have that love, but that it could never be the same for the whole of the world.</p> <p>"It wasn't too long ago that we became lovers," he said, smiling.</p> <p>"That was a long time ago." She smiled. "And you."</p> <p>"No, I meant it at the time. That's why you'd never do it again with me, but why, when we've never made love? Didn't you know that you were doing us a terrible injustice at the time?"</p> <p>"No, not exactly. The world was different. The world was different. But I was still the only one who knew. You, the woman who you wanted me to be, the woman from whom I would live forever. And that was, I know, the truth. But I just never thought it could be true."</p> <p>"I didn't know how things were with you. And I didn't think that you'd ever make love to me with your mouth."</p> <p>"It's true, of course." She looked down into his eyes. But she didn't know what to say.</p> <p>"How often did we go to bed in sin?"</p> <p>"As often as you needed more than one minute, in fact."</p> <p>He smiled as if it really was only a thought. She was looking up at him the same way that she'd been looking up at him the first time they met. She felt his cock starting to twitch.</p> <p>"I've missed being with you."</p> <p>"Me too," he said. "It's been too long."</p> <p>But she just couldn't bring herself to kiss him goodbye. She was too embarrassed about just breaking it off, and she just couldn't. She'd just had too much to drink, but she couldn't stop herself from kissing him. She couldn't bring herself to break off and make love again.</p> <p>"It's no trouble to be with a decent man," he said. "A good husband does a lot better than the one who gets to bed with the woman he loves."</p> <p>"No. It's no trouble at all." She hugged him.</p> <p>"Oh, you're a man!" he said, smiling. "I've missed being with you."</p> <p>"Me too!" she said again. He reached down between them to slide his fingers lightly between her labia:</p> <p>"You're very wet, yourself, darling! I love it when you're so wet."</p> <p>"I'm still a virgin!" she said. "I don't want to wait, Matthew, do you know, for you always...for always."</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"Always." And of course she said so, of course.
