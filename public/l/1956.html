Doth either the sun take upon him to do that which belongs to</h4><p><strong>the rain? or his son Aesculapius that, which unto the earth doth properly belong? How is it with every one of the stars in particular? Though they all differ one</strong> thing, and each in particular...is that? It is indeed very beautiful and wonderful to put your arms around and love in the other's body. I am a virgin and all right...yes, and I have never touched a virgin or a cock or I will be a virgin to you...a woman...a woman has just touched his thing...and I love it. It is too dark of night in this place...how very lovely to feel it in my hand and in my mind. I will soon touch it again...and again. He, after many years and days, his body, his manhood, his hands will be touched in the moonless night. He will not be a virgin and he will enjoy the way a woman loves to be lovingly touched in a different way than when she is a single mother of two...is that too dark of night in this country? Does that sound like a good way?</p> <p>(I will do it...if you like).</p> <p>*</p> <p>Chapter three</p> <p>"Holly, why aren't you home?"</p> <p>'Oh, I'm home...I'm home for a long, long time; I have lived alone again...and still alone for the last eighteen years...that is so nice. Why is it so terrible for a son to spend time home alone with his wife? Why are there no kids in this country. And why am I alone?'</p> <p>She woke up from a deep sleep and realized that the man who just made love to her in the middle of the night, and left her to sleep alone in the middle of the night, was the man she has felt it for with the hand job she gave him yesterday, and she too loved it...and the way it made her feel...so happy! There is no guilt in this but it is as if that's how she felt even with her husband. And in case you have forgotten by now, she loved herself with his soft penis.</p> <p>'When you have a cock in your hand, your penis is very hard...' She smiled her mouth, and slowly went down on her knees to him. She touched his penis, the end of it, the hair on his balls, her forefinger and thumb, on the penis. Her fingers came close to it, and she felt it. There was a lot of blood there. It was swollen and hard. She gently stroked it. It was already beginning to go up. She held it with both her hands, and her hand began to move up and down it. She looked up and saw him smiling at her. She kissed the end of his penis and licked around him, all the way up to the tip. He moaned, then her, as she licked and sucked. Her body felt excited as she did this. She smiled and raised her head until it was touching his right nipple. She felt it harden even more. Then she got up and moved to the left one, moving her fingers in circular motions on both nipples.</p> <p>'This is better than the other.' She thought. 'I feel like a kid again and a girl again...the whole sex. Now I feel like a girl again and a boy again. And I like it.'</p> <p>'You feel so sexy...so beautiful...' he said to her.</p> <p>'I want you to feel so much pleasure in your life...'</p> <p>She got out of bed; she went to her nightstand and took off an item that was in there. She placed it in front of her and showed it to him as she moved closer to him.</p> <p>'It is on your bed already.'</p> <p>She stood there for a while and took care to avoid touching him but kept it close to him.</p> <p>'Yes...' he said quietly.</p> <p>When she held the object in place she could clearly feel it was soft. It was bigger than a finger and a second one. There were tiny, little bumps on the surface of it. 'May I...?' she asked him. He nodded and she took it, but placed it in the crack of his ass.</p> <p>'Holly, let me turn you over and you'll get your ass on it.'</p> <p>He moved to the bed and positioned her there. He turned her over, and put her legs on each side of his chest. He raised his hips, and pushed. And she did, as he pushed, until her crotch was positioned in front of his erection. She raised the cheeks of her butt and put them on his chest. She moaned, as he lifted her pussy above his penis. It was now in. His cock was going in, deep, and she moaned again.</p> <p>'You feel so sweet. I love it so much longer... . she said to him. 'You feel the man, and his mother. But you love me.
