"So," he smiled, "is there any thing the army wants, besides ourselves, that we can bring together without a single-minded goal?"</p> <p>"Well," she smiled. "We've been talking for two and a half weeks about making this world the best it can ever be."</p> <p>"That depends on how we accomplish that," he grinned.</p> <p>"Yes, that's what I'm afraid we had to decide to do," she answered.</p> <p>***</p> <p>"How about a nice, big, big night?" she smiled as they entered their bedroom, and the mood in the room changed dramatically.</p> <p>"I have a bigger one," he smiled. "And the more I do, the better, too."</p> <p>"I've a really big-time, big-time, commitment that you couldn't come up with," she laughed.</p> <p>They kissed again for long moments until Beren was beginning to feel dizzy.</p> <p>"That was something you should have done before now, after your first time," she murmured as his cock began its long trip into her belly.</p> <p>***</p> <p>An hour later, Beren's balls were as sore as ever as he slid into Cheri's sloppy cunt with ease, then they slowly worked themselves out of her arms and onto her sides until he found her breast, sucking and teasing the nipple. She moaned and held her fingers to his mouth as he did so.</p> <p>She began rocking her hips against him almost immediately, just as he intended the next time. They moaned into each other's mouths. They came together almost simultaneously. They sighed their passion into each other's bodies for a while before he rose and drew himself from the bed.</p> <p>"God," he said, "I need to find a place for us, where we can be together again, and again. And, with your body, to tell the truth, I need to give you as much pleasure as you were giving me the last time." He was still fully clothed however when Cheri sat up fully on all fours and took his cock in her hand as he got off the bed. Beren began to follow her onto the bed, but she had other ideas.</p> <p>She sat up and pulled him up on her with one strong, fast move. Their lips met and she closed her eyes and leaned back to give him the freedom to do anything he wanted with her. He started kissing his way down her body, making his way down past the dark mounds of hair that surrounded her pussy, which was dripping with her juices when he kissed them.</p> <p>He looked up at her and smiled. "I want to do this every time," she told him as he lowered himself onto her, kissing her just as he'd kissed her mouth, then her breasts, and finally her belly.</p> <p>When he got to her pussy, he found that she was already sopping wet already, so he dove right in there. He licked her from her clit down into her hole and then up to her clit, while one of her hands went down to his hair, holding him in place. Beren took a moment or so longer before going in to Cheri's rosebud. She was waiting for him, and soon he got what he was looking for. Slowly, he pushed his tongue into her and began licking the outer ring of her ass.</p> <p>He didn't have all of it in him to go in there, though. He wanted to be inside her after all the preparation. He could actually feel her shuddering as he felt her juices gushing onto his tongue and tongue. He felt her fingers in him, too. They had made themselves bigger before they were ready to use the toilet. They were more than one person.</p> <p>It didn't matter; Beren was there, too. And it was going to be so, so good once again. Soon, he would be able to feel her pussy as it was, her ass, her stomach, both of them.</p> <p>After awhile, he stopped briefly to get a fresh condom from the night stand, and then he brought Cheri to her knees and mounted her from behind. Her eyes grew big as he pressed the head of his cock into her back passage.</p> <p>"We've made love before, and we just have to know how it feels to be in love," Beren said as she watched him fuck her.</p> <p>She reached back and pulled on his hand, but then the hand was gone, replaced by hers in his own. She guided the head into her hole and he worked it in and it as deeply as she wanted. His cock was going in on another tunnel as well as they were. Now, he had always.</p> <p></p> <p>"You... I was going in deeper, he did all the other, I've in, I have the other than, like the other, I—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
