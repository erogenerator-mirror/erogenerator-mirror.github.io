He was endeavouring to</strong> get it to be clear, to find the source of the sound that was the source of the nightmarish noises of the nightlife of the world.</p> <p>He opened the door and gazed out from his dark bedroom window. He could make out the figure moving through the streets in the street, walking towards him like a bat-wing in a dike. She was tall at five foot nine inches and was with perfect form: large breasts that were full and firm, firm yet curved and graceful in their youth, while her ass was small yet still feminine. His eyes ran all over those round, firm mams and he had to control himself to keep from cuming in his shorts during the whole trip.</p> <p>She looked over at him as he approached.</p> <p>"Excuse me, the man you sent to me is not that great but..."</p> <p>She stopped as if her head had been dislocated and turned and looked at him.</p> <p>"It was for you, the man I'm looking for. We shall have fun together, yes?" she smiled up at him.</p> <p>"Of course."</p> <p>He approached her and she pushed him backward to the bed and then lay down on her back.</p> <p>"Now come and lick me, my lover."</p> <p>It took the next ten minutes for Scrooge to get his tongue back on her pussy, which he tasted again, again, again. He could even detect that her juices had been licked up, that she too had been very wet and he couldn't resist reaching out with his tongue to taste.</p> <p>Her taste was different from his own but more pleasant to see. He found that he enjoyed it, that he tasted it. His mouth started to go to work on her more than a little. His hands explored her body but found a pair of tits that stood high and firm. He found her nipples, which were already a bit pink and stood out. He moved in closer, he kissed her lips very gently. He could smell her body and it was delightful.</p> <p>As he found her tongue to be an avid mouth to start with, he started to make love to her with his mouth. At the same time he found that she had also found his body and was now taking his hard cock in hand, making it rock hard. Her eyes showed her pleasure to him but also a nervousness of the moment.</p> <p>When her wet pussy was on his mouth and tongue, he felt her warm hands, her fingers caressing his scrotum as his cock was being licked. Then they were moving lower... a finger on either side of his shaft, and her mouth moved down, slowly as he had her clitoris, but gradually as her clit came into contact... as she had always done whenever he kissed her, in order to bring her pleasure. Scrooge was surprised how aroused he became by the experience of seeing a woman suck his hard cock and make him cum even though it was only in his dream. However, what he really wanted, all the time was to find the source of the noise of the night-time night-light and the smell of her vagina, so he let his tongue explore her lower regions until his tongue brought her towards a complete orgasm and then she sucked him so that he came into her warm, wet mouth.</p> <p>When he returned from this, however, his penis grew again. His fingers found his lips and, opening his mouth to let the precum escape from his body, he tasted it as he continued to lick her pussy.</p> <p>The feel of his tongue licking her lips and her clitoris had made Scrooge want more of her. He began to fuck her with his tongue and now could taste the cum rising up from her pussy and his face as it glinted in the light. His whole body was alive with pleasure, it would be impossible for him to describe how wonderful it felt.</p> <p>He found his self going up into her face to give her the pleasure of his mouth and her tongue. It was heaven! His cock jumped when he was about to make love to her mouth again. It was so hard and hard and he wondered if she could take it up into her mouth because of its height. She was so happy from the feeling of his tongue in her mouth and now from the feel of his lips and his fingers on her clitoris.</p> <p>The time was right, it was the right time to make love. He slowly pushed himself up into her and felt her legs and shoulders. It had been too long since his last climax before he remembered to bring himself a cock with which to play the part of the man who was entering her vagina. Scrooge moved his face to hers and they kissed as his cock moved in and out of her vagina, filling her. As she felt herself coming again. She did too, she felt both his hands all that she had left. She had to move to find her face, to kiss and the woman who was theâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
