If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must have carried me here. I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but</strong> failed. Too many times I woke to see my sleeping beauty beside me. My beautiful and strong love and gentle, and most unanticipated as of today. I was going to do everything in My power to please her. If only I didn't have to make love to her right next to me, I would. I would love to fall in love with her.</p> <p>I don't know how we got married, but somehow we found out that we loved each other. It was an odd day as I had the wedding in September of 2005. I don't remember. The most normal, but not unusual one at that time in my life. After a month of marriage, we decided our lives were not right anymore. We had begun living our happy, blissful, and loving lives with no worries. Life in our own home had been boring as a result of too many long, boring days where we couldn't even have sex. Our sex life was only marginally pleasurable because it was always only my first time of getting fucked. We were in love when it came to our bed.</p> <p>I remember that as well. I couldn't wait until she decided to open her legs, so I could fuck her. I remember her wanting to watch me fuck her. I've never done that, but we have both had our share of experiences recently. Her body is beautiful. If you know your way around her body, you'll do whatever I tell you. She is a lucky girl, I can assure you. She will make you happy when you fuck her first. And, if it not done right, she will make you happy. As a married man, I don't like having sex with a married woman. I don't like women treating me like a man. But, I can't deny what I have. It's so damn sexy and sexy when a woman fucks someone with a strap-on dildo, and I like it that way.</p> <p>Our first time, I remember everything, but as I reminisce I remember her asking, "May I make love with a strap-on dildo"? She didn't answer, but I did. I think she was asking me to put a cock in her mouth, so that she may suck on my aching cock in front of all of us that night. If we were alone in our bed, I don't remember what she would do, but I do know my ass needed a hard cock, and she did. I remember the look on her face when I started pounding her pussy. I felt like such a pervert.</p> <p>I do remember the fear that she would just leave me alone if I didn't start fucking her before we fell asleep, and if that happened, I can't imagine what she would have done if we were alone that night.</p> <p>But, I remember that I was never really sorry that she wanted it. She did love it. I mean really loved it.</p> <p>Our first time was a couple weeks ago. We were taking a vacation just to watch the sunsets. I had been in town and I had brought her up to go to the beach. We were in bed together with her lying in the middle of bed, staring at the sky. We watched for a few minutes on the beach, just talking about mundane things while she touched herself. For once, she wanted to know if I would eat her pussy. It was my first time doing that. I didn't know it was going to happen, but I started asking her about it too.</p> <p>She asked me when I started. At first I was embarrassed because I had never done it, but then I realized how much I loved it. I really loved her pussy. What she tasted and smelled was what I loved. It was all I would ever know. I had never tasted another woman's sweet pussy before, but I had loved the feel of her skin on my tongue and mouth, and I loved the taste of me cum when my cock exploded. As if it had been a lifetime since she asked me that question. I had never tasted a woman's pussy before, at least not like this.</p> <p>It was too much for me while watching her. I never felt like this before.</p> <p>But, I know that I would not do it just because she wants me to. I would ask her what she wanted, and I would do it anyway. So, I came out from under her clothes in the middle of the night after a couple of bottles of wine. I don't know how I would look to her. I think she wants me to look at her like that when we're alone. I know. If I could not do that to her just then be like that.</p> <p></p> <p>I looked at her and asked her about me to look at her to get hard. She said as I should.</p> <p></p> <p>As I looked at her Look at her Look at me to look at her.
