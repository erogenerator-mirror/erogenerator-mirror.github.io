The storm-tossed sea of European history had subsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm. But the mysterious forces that move humanity (mysterious because</strong> in centuries past, our minds were on the verge of total destruction had finally reached to the surface). In those days, we all had our lives, and this time we had the most incredible adventure yet.</p> <p>I stood at the far end of a long, sandy beach that was now hidden from the sun and had already disappeared to sea. I was surrounded by a group of four men dressed in swimsuits. Three of them went down the beach to surf. One was the head man, one of two of the other two going down. One of the younger men came back to join them. I noticed one of the men was my husband. The men were both wearing bikinis. There was nothing unusual about wearing bikinis. The other three guys were all wearing swimsuits. The younger one looked to be in his early twenties, a bit of a hunk he'd apparently inherited from his mother. He was wearing a tight swimsuit that showed more flesh than any male model I'd seen. The outline of his erection made me salivate.</p> <p>I knew we'd be busy until tomorrow morning. But I didn't care either. I could do this. Or not. I was doing something I'd wanted to do since high-school. And I'd wanted to do it for years now. I loved sucking guys off. I especially loved watching guys cum, especially on their chests. It was erotic. Really it was very erotic.</p> <p>I knew then that I was doomed. I'd been sucking cock since I was in high school. I'd sucked cock for a very long time. And now that I'd sucked three guys I couldn't keep my eyes off the bulges in their swimsuits. The bulges weren't really that big but they were so firm. They looked so sexy they made me hot. But now I had to get off from that beautiful cock so I could get my rocks off. I wanted to feel it move inside me.</p> <p>In my mind I had brought up the idea of feeling a cock move inside me. So when the man's cock moved against my cheek and I opened my mouth I could just feel something like a hard rod pressing against my lips. I let him hold my head and slid forward so my mouth was only just inside the tip of his erection.</p> <p>We had talked about this earlier on but I have a vague recollection that I didn't really know him. The man was definitely into the idea of having his cock inside me, though it may seem that way to you, but that's not what this story was about. I mean, what we were doing really was nothing more than having two strangers fuck our brains out. It was like a long story that we were just supposed to be making out to be teenagers. We'd already cum a couple of times. We were a couple. We were friends. But that was no longer the case.</p> <p>The cock was still inside my mouth, the tip of it barely reaching down my throat. I couldn't even wrap my lips fully around it. If I tried I wouldn't be able to move enough, even if the cock was so big I couldn't breathe. I could only feel it slowly but steadily moving in and out of my mouth.</p> <p>My eyes were closing and my mind was in that perfect zone of calm, peaceful bliss. I could feel the cock against the back of my throat. It was throbbing, moving.</p> <p>The two guys were still watching, one of them holding his cock while the other moved his hand between his legs. He kept getting closer to his climax. I heard the other one groan but did nothing to intervene. Instead I just held my mouth against the base, as far as it would go but not far enough to get a good grip on his hard cock.</p> <p>Now it began . . . Oh, shit!</p> <p>The man behind my husband groaned and came all over me. His cock was still half-erect inside my mouth and my lips were stretched so wide it hurt. The two other men had moved apart and I knew they had watched me with a couple of hands on their erect cocks. I was shaking like an earthquake. I needed to get off from the thought of my best friend getting off inside me, and not from looking at two men jerking off together.</p> <p>When it was over the man on top of me lay still and the cock stayed inside me. I had felt his cock jump. I didn't know how to feel. I was suddenly very aware of the hot, slick, silky-smooth cock inside.</p> <p>I felt I could just barely feel the other penis pressing against my lips. I felt the other penis press against my throat. I felt warm penis inside me. I could feel his bare dick, so warm, but so, so, so, so, so, nothing. The feeling—</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>What can I am there, inside me.</p> <p>I feel me—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
