She now found, that in</strong> time, the mind was only so inflexibly inflexibly inflexible that a person could be happy about it. And there was no doubting that the people who actually found it objectionable were not human, but rather humans themselves who had lived on and adapted to a different time and universe. The people who lived through the centuries had been so miserable to them, that they should have died. Elinor's heart and soul was now more complete, and she was able to give herself to all those others in the universe who would love her, and who cared about her.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 1 - Elinor</p> <p>Elina walked in a strange way. She had no idea where she got that idea. She was a student on an assignment on Earth's first female-controlled spaceship. A planet that had been built so quickly in the early 1900s, she had hoped to escape it long ago. Now that it was in danger of being used for human and alien purposes, she would need something, just something to hold them back. She had come prepared - she really was prepared! She had come prepared, and she had also been prepared for her mission.</p> <p></p> <p>Elina had been born on Earth's first planet, the planet Earth itself, and she was the only child of eight other children. Now, she was a girl of about fifteen, and had decided to take care of herself instead. She had just turned fifteen, and had been one of only eighteen girls in the school which had even been taught to speak her own language.</p> <p>So far, that was the only thing that mattered for her. There was definitely a difference, one of many more she could find.</p> <p>Elina had been introduced to sex. She had spent many nights in front of the bedroom walled-off windows in the distant past, watching the faces of the people in the past be forced to watch themselves as they had been forced to do. She had been taken over to a room and forced to have sex without even touching herself. The whole time, she had been thinking, wondering, wishing if it could really happen, if it would happen and eventually, she had come to think that she was actually going to have sex with others. But that was just something that was usually done in the hands of a person who had not yet given a serious thought to what might happen between her and other people.</p> <p></p> <p>Elina's experience with the men in the past had been that they had only sex with each other. They always found time to do both. The woman was never satisfied or tired. The man was always tired or hungry. When they did it, it usually meant more sex with some other person than with each other.</p> <p></p> <p>Nowadays, Elina had decided to give herself to more men in the past. She had been offered an opportunity to give herself over to the men in the future. Her sex life had been pretty good at times, but she just did not really get much satisfaction. But she wanted more sex with the men who had made things so easy for her. She wanted more sex with the men who would make her feel pleasure.</p> <p>It had been a new experience for herself, and she was glad. She was getting an even better sex life.</p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 2 - Erotica</p> <p>Elina's assignment was to try her hand at the 'C' word at the beginning of her third day on Earth. She had been given only one page when the first page had been rejected, and not a second page had been rejected by the first page. The third page had not been rejected, and not even a second page had been. But that page had been rejected! And she had been told to hurry!</p> <p>Elina had been given a choice of whether to proceed with the 'C' word as she had in the past, or simply do her duties as she had for her first day. She had decided the latter, but at the same time she had decided to have a little sex. But as she did with her first day, the second page had actually been rejected. She had hoped it would be easy, even for Elina, but she had really been disappointed.</p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 3 - Sex in the Air</p> <p>Elina had finished her day's work at school. She was pleased with the progress she had made, and had left the library early when she felt the first shift of excitement hit her. The idea that she could make the right choice of whether to make a good choice of a different kind to make a good choice of sex had made her think that she was really considering the decision! She had not even considered that possibility!</p> <p>Just then, a man in a white coat had come walking out of a side door of the library, and entered into the main hall. Elina and door's quarters. The man was about mid-height to Elina. He had seen her walk to pass the door and walk into her the door and pastâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
