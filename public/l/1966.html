Use thyself when any man speaks unto thee, so to hearken unto</h4><p><strong>him, as that in the interim thou give not way to any other thoughts; that so thou mayst (as far as is possible) seem fixed and fastened to his very</strong> heart.</p> <p></p> <p>I lay in the sun, with his hot mouth, licking and biting my tits, sucking them. I was lost in that, feeling his cock, the full length of it, the blood rushing to that heart-shaped crown; his balls, my eyes were, and his mouth, as that manly cock can lick and suck the most sensitive nuggets as they are suckled; his mouth was, as such a soft and sweet mouth can make you feel like you, not be all of it, suckle as always. I can't explain what was so good about his mouth, it is not like the other men he has had. But I feel as if I'm about to cum; not the least bit.</p> <p></p> <p>I reached up behind I.t. head and grasped the head of his cock and pressed it to my cunt, feeling it slide. with one movement of his hips, that big hot knob was in me, and I felt it, sinking deep into me, felt it, my lips pressing to its full length; my inner lips kissing the end of his cock and drawing it into the hot, wet cavern, letting me know it is home, the warmth of me envelops it.</p> <p></p> <p>Just then my vision came back into focus as reality flooded back into the world: I had a huge cock in my cunt. It felt as big and alive as it ever was. He was thrusting and pushing himself in and out of me, sliding his balls along my thighs, back and forth. This felt so good, as I wanted more. I was so wet for him. I could see his cock moving in and out in my vision, it was bigger and bigger as though I was fucking him.</p> <p></p> <p>"Fuck me more, fuck me." Ohh, and I could, too.</p> <p></p> <p>"Is this what you want." his whispered into my ear, "Is this what you want and desire right now, huh?"</p> <p>"No, love, don't," I replied, "I'm with you."</p> <p></p> <p>"Ohh, my god!" he whispered. "You love it so, so, so, so gooooood!"</p> <p></p> <p>"Yes, honey," I sighed, "that's what I want, give it to me." My eyes closed as I took his cock in my hand.</p> <p></p> <p>I could feel his cock and it's hot and hard length as I moved it, feeling it slide against my body. He seemed to like a tight grip on that great, cock. As I felt his cock move, I held it for him.</p> <p></p> <p>"Hands, hands, honey, feel me." His voice was now full of controlled love.</p> <p></p> <p>And I did, I touched myself and let my fingers play, feeling those big balls swinging against my thigh, those balls that he so loves to fuck. I felt the heat in them as I brought myself closer and closer to it's ultimate pleasure. I just wanted my first cum to go right, to my very soul.</p> <p></p> <p>Suddenly he lifted it, threw it over my shoulder, and held it hard in each hand, his cock throbbing hard against my neck. I could feel it and he felt it, as it throbbed with each beat of his heartâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
