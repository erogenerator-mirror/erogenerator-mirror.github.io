I pushed my legs up toward the sky and opened them wide for them.</p> <p>I could feel myself getting wet, though they didn't notice. I felt them finger fuck me, slowly.</p> <p>I'm quite sensitive in this position. I'm not just a small tight cunt and can be fucked at will, you know.</p> <p>I could feel myself get wetter, though not much. And this was not what I had needed.</p> <p>I'd been having my pussy kissed by two boys at the same time, and I'd been a virgin, but they'd made me a slut in our own way. How much more does anyone know before they make you lose yourself in their mouths?</p> <p>The fingers on my thighs moved away, and I felt the cool night air wafting across my cunt, and the fingers on my breasts. They began to caress my breasts, and pinch my nipples. I felt so full and eager.</p> <p>I was sure, however, that only I could feel it at that moment, in the very centre of my sexual bliss. I was ready for all those things, but the fingers had changed places, and now were pressing in and out of me.</p> <p>The fingers on my pussy began to move faster, and I felt them slide up my thighs to my butt; slowly. I felt it going at different speeds, and it never reached my clit until the fingers were pushing into me. My ass was pressing against the fingers inside my cunt, and I felt every movement as they moved up from my butt to my clit, and then back again, and all the way back to my clit.</p> <p>My body felt like it was a vice now, my nipples were rubbing against the nightgown, and my head was down on the pillow, which meant that my whole face was resting on the pillow, and that my long blonde hair was tickling my cheek.</p> <p>I didn't look round at all, just felt it. My head was on the edge of the bed, and my ass had the two fingers inside me, and I felt myself getting closer, closer to orgasm.</p> <p>It's always a good thing about girls, if their bodies aren't working out quite as well as you might think, isn't it?</p> <p>I felt the fingers moving in and out faster, and more firmly. My ass seemed to be doing the same thing, and I felt the two fingers on my anus, and I knew that was where their hands belonged.</p> <p>My body started to shake, and I felt it. Then, I felt the fingers pressing against the opening to my rectum, and I was there – like a firefly inside my body. It started to go into me again, and soon the orgasm burst free, its warmth filling my body, and I squeezed my fingers in tight.</p> <p>It kept going up and down in me, as my body was caught up in the pleasure, and I felt like I was on the plane of heaven.</p> <p>Then the fingers left my body, and I felt it going back to my ass. It's funny how quickly you get over it, and just want a whole new experience.</p> <p>This time, however, it felt different. I felt like when you do something with your toes, and then you feel it. It was like when you touch your toes, and the feeling is just so good, and you just want to do it again.</p> <p>But when you put your feet on the floor, and your thighs are pressing against your ankles, and even your toes are touching the carpet, and it feels better.</p> <p>You're always so busy, you know.</p> <p>I felt their hands leave me, and I felt them leave my pussy. I felt their hands on my thighs, lifting me up, just from the bed, and I felt my legs being lifted high and pushed into the air. Then, I felt the backs of my ankles being pulled up, and then my arms being pulled to the top of the bed.</p> <p>I felt my head on the bed, and I heard the bed springs bang against its bed, and I felt my body being laid down on the bedding behind me.</p> <p>Their hands grabbed me, and I felt the bedding sliding in. I didn't feel my arms being pulled away, or the bed being lifted off the bed in front, but as one of them was lifting me, and pushing me down, I felt the other being set away.</p> <p></p> <p>down it.</p> <p>and</p> <p></p> <p>and as if you're on me.</p> <p></p> <p>and you are</p> <p>and you're</p> <p>'re together—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
