And the sex was intense in the sex of this story, with no break from the sex in between, in the best part of the story, and of course in the sex scenes. When the sexual dialogue was completed, and a few parts had been added, each character would write a story in the following chapter so the story would carry on to its climax.</p> <p>Chapter One</p> <p>It was a Wednesday, October 4th. The start of a long weekend. The day promised to be the perfect day for a night out, with dinner, drinks, a nice movie, and a good time.</p> <p>We drove to a town just a few miles from our hotel. On the freeway, we passed a sign announcing a restaurant, with our dinner reservation a few minutes away, and no other car to be found.</p> <p>We had been going to the place for over three months, and knew that nothing could spoil it. So we decided to go to a local hotel for the night...</p> <p>We arrived the next morning at the hotel. We checked into our hotel suite and went out for a walk on Canal Street, along with several other couples in their casual clothes. We found a nice bar in one of the hotel's lounge rooms. On the way to the bar, we stopped to watch a movie.</p> <p>The movie was a horror movie, and a few more couples joined us at the bar for a late dinner and several drinks we had just consumed.</p> <p>When we got back to our room we quickly undressed, and got into bed, under the moon and stars, so it was pretty dark, with one light bulb and some lights outside. I got into bed with Carol, after we had taken our towels off, and immediately began to caress her body with a tender touch that would've made anyone else jealous. As we kissed in each other's arms, I could feel her hand touching mine in hers. Then I felt her hand caress the bottom of my cock, and I could feel her fingers caressing it through the thin layers of my boxers.</p> <p>I reached down and began to stroke her crotch, and could feel the wetness that was growing in her panties. Her hand found her nipple, and I could feel her hand stroking the underside of her breasts.</p> <p>I kissed her neck, her cheeks, and neckline. Then I ran my hands down her back, to her ass, around it, and slipped my fingers under the leg piece of her panties. As my lips were about to kiss her nipple, my free hand went to her hip and stroked the side of her thigh, from her panties to her hip. I was feeling her pussy, and she was feeling me.</p> <p>I found her nipple, and sucked it into my mouth. Then I slid my fingers down her body, and began to caress her pubic hair. I was caressing her pussy, feeling the moisture of her wetness, as I moved my fingertips to caress her clit. With a moan which I could feel from my tongue circling her nipple, she slid down until both her knees lay against my ass, and her pussy was resting against my fingers.</p> <p>She pushed her panties off, and I could feel her fingers on my cock, as she began to caress my cock. After a couple minutes of fingering her, I moved to her clit, and began to press my finger inside her pussy. I could feel her body begin to move up and down as she moved up my fingers, and down my cock.</p> <p>I moved my tongue to her pussy, kissing it, and tasting the sweet juices that were pouring out of her, while her hand felt my cock. Then she pulled her hand away, and reached into the nightstand drawer, pulling out a strap-on harness. She attached the harness to my cock, taking the harness, lube, and a condom, and slipping the strap-on into my hips.</p> <p>She straddled my ass, and started to lower her pussy onto my cock. My cock was in her pussy. Her legs were on mine, and she was controlling both of us with her fingers. Then she lowered herself all the way onto my cock, and pressed me inside of her pussy, until my balls were resting against her ass.</p> <p>"Don't move," she instructed me, "just enjoy the feeling." I could feel her pussy muscles caressing my cock, and I knew I was about to orgasm. She smiled at me, and said, "I'm on the pill, you can come in my ass."</p> <p>I was about to say something, but before I could, her lips surrounded mine, she kissed me, and I could feel her clit, and she told me: "I've wanted me so. I'm good. My c'n"n'n good... I've, love you"n—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
