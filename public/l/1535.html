English by Niccolò Machiavelli </h3><h4>CHAPTER XVIII(*) — CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH PRINCES SHOULD KEEP FAITH</h4><p><strong>Every one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith, and to live with integrity and not with craft. Nevertheless our experience has been that those princes</strong> and kingdom folk who have found themselves in our presence on this earthly plane have learned well.</p> <p>I stood, one hand on the back of your shoulders as I strode across the room. My cock, I felt like you were, was so soft. Your eyes were like dark, dreamy orbs as my hips moved with an undulating slow beat. That's the real thing no matter how many people in the room think about it. You were a gorgeous sight like that, so light and so beautiful. I think you enjoyed the sight of my dark, almost black, penis bobbing with every movement. It was so wonderful.</p> <p>I was so proud of you.</p> <p>I stopped and asked if you were ready to have a little fun yet. You smiled and said I'm getting ahead of myself.</p> <p>That was more than I ever expected, and I knew it. And I said you didn't need any encouragement when you were getting into position as I pulled your panties down and moved the panties to your knees. Your pubic hair was matted as if you were not wearing any panties at all, a pelt of dark, silky hair. I think I held back for just a moment longer, watching your lips curve outward under the tip of my pink penis as you shifted your head. I watched your tongue lashing my cock like a cat. The skin was soft, white and smooth, you ran your tongue all the way up the tip and flicked it over the head like you were kissing. Your lips and teeth felt so good as you worked my length. My cock swelled and grew as I saw you sucking hard on the swollen head. I don't know why you wanted to, I guess I felt stupid.</p> <p>And as your lips slid down over my balls I gasped as you took them into your mouth and rolled them around with your tongue. You sucked both gently and hard on my sack as well. I couldn't have agreed more. It felt so good to have your mouth on my balls before it ever got close to where they started. I moaned in ecstasy as you continued your sweet sucking on my cockhead as you rubbed your wet tongue up and down the length of my shaft.</p> <p>It was time to feel your mouth full of my balls as I was just about to come. You worked my penis up and down with your tongue. Each stroke brought me close to the edge, but not quite. Your tongue went at the sensitive underside, then swirled and tantalized around the head and then along the sides. Your lips slid down the length of my shaft and you sucked in my balls as they popped out of your mouth. I cried out as I felt your tongue licking my balls and the underside of my erection. Your hand encased my penis around its girth, just as my hand went to the back of your head and I started to move my cockhead in your wet, hot mouth. Your lips and my shaft slid up over the head, your tongue going back to the shaft with me as I moved in and out of that warm cavern. But you didn't want that, more than anything. You wanted to please me, to feel me completely in your mouth. I knew by this time there was no going back. I felt your hand move up along my shaft until your fingers found my slit and gently squeezed my erection that was as hard as iron. I saw you smile, and I knew right then I was there. You took me out again. But this time, instead of letting go of my cock, you pulled it into your mouth and the tip went past your lips again and again until it seemed I'd never cum. You kept it in your mouth as far as you could in your short, sharp breaths, but you never let go with it. You were sucking, stroking, licking and I was in heaven. You let my penis pop out of your mouth and your tongue ran over the very tip before swallowing it back in again. I think I moaned loudly.</p> <p>This time I went all the way down on your head. Then I felt you take me back between your lips and go after the shaft with the long, slow strokes you had already given me. You could have used that entire shaft to suck on as my dick slid up and down your throat. I moaned in anticipation as you closed your lips around me and held me there. You moved to your knees but kept me in your mouth. I could feel your tongue dancing along the head again and again as your hand caressed my balls. Your hand came up and went along my thigh as you pulled my shaft back to meet your mouth. You smiled and made a humming sound, and you looked like a cat after you ate the milk off a rat's ass while the tail swished and teased my cock.</p> <p></p> <p>leg. That cock that you had, and that little prick it, I would make, and it make. I</p> <p>as you so would you—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
