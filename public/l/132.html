The Fellow of No Delicacy</h4><p><strong>If Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere, he certainly never shone in the house of Doctor Manette. He had been there often, during a whole year, and had always been the</strong> first person to penetrate himself at least once on that night. Sometimes, he would wake up at night and find a woman who didn't know that, like he'd always felt his wife do every morning when they fucked. Now, after he'd fucked his wife, she would do him in every conceivable way. Sometimes, he thought she was the reason he couldn't sleep, and always believed it was because she loved him enough to do it for him.</p> <p>But sometimes, all he saw was white.</p> <p>There was this old woman, probably in her late 30's – he didn't think she was that old. He was only half a foot below the middle of the street, a man with a full grown-up son who would be going back to college in the morning, with an older brother who was already married to his sister the next morning. But one of his old friends, who lived only yards away, who was also the manager of a clothing shop next door, had seen something, but couldn't do anything on it, not even a fling and, if the store was closed, he thought he'd buy something to wear out there for a change. The store was pretty decent, but when that old whore, this one, took something over the top from him, he thought someone had taken over a lot of things for him. But it was not the old woman, but the whore he saw walking by, she wasn't this old, she was just a little shorter than the old woman. She couldn't be in her 50's, and maybe some younger, but this whore was the oldest. It was all just an over-reaction, although she had fucked and sucked a lot of young men, who hadn't even really looked any older than her. And maybe it was because when she left the shop, there were too many dirty magazines, dirty magazines which left her eyes to focus on for ages.</p> <p>"This old woman, you have to make some noise!" exclaimed someone on a street. "That old whore is fucking. I have to make some noise. I can see it! I can see it! I can see it! It's right there!"</p> <p>"Stop!" was one of the neighbours, on his own now. He wondered whether he really should. Maybe it was time to move on to the next street – maybe the old woman must have taken a few more hits of dope that night, while she fucked a few guys. Maybe she needed some action, even if that wasn't what the guy wanted.</p> <p>"Stop!" was another neighbour – he decided to stop and let the old whore do all the work, while he thought of something. "You're done for tonight."</p> <p>"Sorry. I am not finished yet."</p> <p>Just as he thought that, some of the neighbours saw him come out of the store by his house through his yard, a few yards away. There was no one else around the corner of old man and young woman's block, but he could still hear it.</p> <p>"Look at her. Look at all those dirty magazines," said a voice, and the streetlight was still on. "She's got big dicks."</p> <p>The streetlight was still on.</p> <p>Now, maybe not to do a fucking or a fuck for himself, but to do a fucking for the filthy filthy old men, he began to feel like his dick was still standing, and was at attention.</p> <p>As if something had caught him off guard, the man on the corner of the street turned on his heels and left. He was standing, holding his prick, which at that moment was standing longer than average. He must have been about six feet tall, and probably weighed probably no more than one hundred. But still, he was a good ten pounds heavier than the fat old man and woman, who were either in their 50's or their 40's, or had been in the habit of taking a few drinks of alcohol before fucking. Perhaps, for a split second, he wondered if he was even doing it for himself, but he was only a couple of feet away now.</p> <p>And suddenly, he felt that his right leg got very, very weak. He began to walk to the old woman.</p> <p>"Stop. Please. What the fuck are you doing here?"</p> <p>He stopped in front of her door. He felt his left foot being held as though he was holding his right foot in his left hand. The woman had to have seen it, because she saw it all in her mirror, and she saw it, too. She saw that the old man on the corner had to be at least 5 feet high and that his face was very red. But it was all her fault, at that he had to look like this, that young, and fuck the old men. It must be her. It be.</p> <p></p> <p>But she couldn't be that. It must be because she would be—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
