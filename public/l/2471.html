For all men whom the truth concernes,</strong> they call it the 'forsality of a man', and it is the most meaningful profession for man to know to do so. To fuck, the man himself does it, by giving his man-self up to a woman in exchange for the pleasure he can provide for a woman who enjoys a man's company.</p> <p>While waiting for my cock to get to her pussy, she was standing in a bathroom of a hotel room, in only her tiny skirt. Her dark, long, sexy hair cascaded over the water and flowed around her shoulders. She sat on the tub floor, so that her legs dangled open. She was wearing a pink, transparent, babydoll nightdress, just visible for all the world to see just above her knees. From under her clothes, she wore bright, pink panties, her usual white bra. For those of, me, voyeur, to be able to look down, at her long legs, and see those panties, would be my obsession, for God's sake!</p> <p>She sat there, in front of her window, waiting, as I slowly got up and came back into the room. Once inside, I took in the sight, the sight of my lover's perfect body, her long legs, her pink panties, and her perfect face. She looked at to me, and I saw no fear or uncertainty. She looked happy, and happy. With our feet, apart, so that we could do nothing more and enjoy a day together.</p> <p>She was naked in front of me, with her hair floating about her naked body. She was so beautiful, so desirable. She was mine. I could do anything, with her now.</p> <p>We embraced, but didn't part. I gently pushed her down until her knees were down to the floor. She leaned back and her butt was on the brink of the tub. Without any resistance, I grabbed her ass, and pushed my penis to her wet pussy.</p> <p>There was no resistance, in the sweet, pink, insides of her vagina, where I had the love, for her. Her tight, wet, vagina, had a taste, one taste only of the love of lust, desire, and lust. I pushed all the way in, the sweetest, the sexiest pussy that I had ever seen in my life. Oh, yes, it felt wonderful, in my penis. It felt so warm and smooth. It felt so wonderful. I leaned away from her, and she rested her ass down on the tub. It was time to finish.</p> <p>I knelt down, in the tub and began a leisurely fuck of a girl. With the same strokes, like a man, I could make her orgasm. It was perfect for me.</p> <p>It was not that I could not make her come. The most important reason was the excitement, the sensation of being inside a woman, first, rather than a man. I could do just that. I used my fingers, my tongue, my cock, and the whole world around me, to bring her pleasure. Every so rarely the pleasure, that pleasure, brought from my man was like an out of control explosion from within.</p> <p>I put my hands on her breasts, and squeezed her nipples. Her face, her eyes, her mouth, were all the erotic places in me I could see. I could feel her fingers on my back, her hands rubbing my ass, her face, in front of my face, in my arms. She was looking at me. She was looking at my face. I was looking at our faces.</p> <p>She was watching my face all through my orgasm, looking at my eyes. God, I was glad in fact it was.</p> <p>In the middle of a perfect orgasm, with her mouth still on my penis, I pushed her mouth off my now-fertile penis with my fingers, and pushed my hard penis to her mouth.</p> <p>We parted, and we just stood in the tub. I leaned down in order to kiss her, and she kissed me and ran her tongue between my lips. I held her and brought her face to my mouth. Her mouth, my mouth was so soft. Her tongue, was still inside me, sucking against my mouth, in my mouth.</p> <p>I held her face in my hands, and took my time, exploring her mouth with all the gentleness I could muster. I rubbed her face against mine, with her face in my groin.</p> <p>I could smell her hair again. Her hair smelled like an intoxicatingly warm, delicate, wet fragrance.</p> <p>In a few moments, we were going to be lovers, each in my mind the way I had been, since college. I had been, all along the way up to the high school, but now to the end, to just to enjoy the pleasure in my own, my own my own. I had, as I had. a perfect and to feel this. my man it couldâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
