With that thought in mind, I asked for the full works I could hope for, with a final word, I hope for all women in the world to have a wonderful time and celebrate the glory of our culture."</p> <p>He stared at me then, a slightly smirk on his lips, as he pulled the condom onto my shaft and handed me the box.</p> <p>"If I didn't know any better I'd say this might be the perfect time to do something to myself. I mean, what if I'm just a teenager, then I don't have to look for myself in the bathroom with a condom on."</p> <p>"I really enjoyed your performance while you were being so gentle with this big dildo, Miss Davis, and even with you being so good to me. Now you get to see it for yourself."</p> <p>He laughed. "Of course you've already seen my dick when you were in full view. Now we can go upstairs. Here we go."</p> <p>He began by unbuttoning my shirt buttons from the bottom to the top of my torso, his fingers lingering over my nipples through the thin fabric of my bra. As he did that his hands kept running up and down my chest, until his hands reached the cup of my bra. He tugged it up over my breasts, my nipples stiffening as he revealed them. He tugged on the cups to remove it, then pushed down on my shoulders, forcing me to pull my shoulders back so that he could slip the straps off my shoulders.</p> <p>Slowly he reached his arms around my back, his hands working their way to the front of my pants as he lowered his face to my chest. He licked one of my nipples before beginning to suck and chew my left nipple, causing me to moan at his expert touch. His hands worked their way on down over my belly towards my jeans, unbuttoning them. Slowly he lowered his mouth again to my stomach and worked his way towards the button of my jeans, which he deftly undid with his thumb, then unzipped my pants and slid my pants down, allowing them to drop at my feet as his hands began their journey upwards the inside of my thighs.</p> <p>I lifted my legs as much as my hips would allow them to allow while he worked his way back up my body, my mouth hanging in open anticipation. Finally he reached my face in one swift move, which caused me to gasp even more. He leaned forward and gave me a kiss on the cheek.</p> <p>I was in his world now. It was my first time to kiss a man, but how I would like to be able to do this with him is another story altogether.</p> <p>After he kissed my cheek a second time, he lifted my face towards his and we shared a quick kiss on the lips, which quickly led to another quick, more passionate, kiss, then more passionate, which led to another quick, more intense, kiss.</p> <p>I finally broke the kiss, gasping, and breaking the hold he had on my mouth as he leaned towards me and slowly worked his tongue along the seam of my lips. I sighed at the contact, feeling my heart beat even faster and my heart skip a beat. As our lips parted with a breath I saw his eyes looking down at my lips and his lips felt so good in mine.</p> <p>"There", he murmured, "there now," before pulling his head back to look into my eyes, which I noticed had a small smile on them as they met mine.</p> <p>"I had my doubts about how you would feel about kissing me, Miss Davis, but believe me, whatever happens on this trip, we can learn from each other."</p> <p>He reached out his hand for me to help him get dressed and before I had a chance to decline, I had dropped my own shirt from a nearby table and, grabbing my own clothing off the chair and quickly got out of his way. He smiled at me as he undid his trousers and helped me out of my shoes, but before I could get his jeans to him, his hand was on my back, helping me into the bathroom.</p> <p>Once the bathroom door was closed he turned the water on to get the temperature going, which is not the best thing for people to do in a bathroom. It's not long before the water turns to scalding but quickly becomes cold. He quickly pulled off his shirt and dropped his jeans to the floor as the cold water began to run out of the bathroom and all around the place of washing cloth in the wall next to the sink. There are three stalls on one wall and the door to the other one. He quickly turned the water on, turned the tap to its lowest temp, adjusted the settings and stepped out of the taps, then closed the door until he stood back to the counter.</p> <p></p> <p>"You are, in each toilet."</p> <p>The bathroom.</p> <p>The bathroomâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
