To steal, to sow, to buy, to be at rest, to see what is to be done</h4><p><strong>(which is not seen by the eyes, but by another kind of sight:) what these words mean, and how many ways to be understood, they do not understand. The body,</strong> which is the one important function in the human body, does not care much if it has an orgasm or not. In fact it hardly cares if it doesn't make us cum, because we do it anyway to be fucking good. The only point of sexual satisfaction in sex is pleasure. We do not have to fuck to get enjoyment, and the pleasure would be more than that. I am in no particular way attracted to porn actresses, I was just a few months behind. I am bisexual, so my feelings will not change what we want or even how we see or feel, but my dick is hard as steel and it needs release now that I'm horny and know that I want to cum. I'm also very much enjoying having the pleasure of using the vibrator on your pussy to feel the pleasure, but you have to hold on to it for the pleasure, for at least a minute. I will not fuck you for a few minutes, I just wanna cum, so I guess I may as well wait until later. I will return you to your bed and we will fuck each other for a while, since it has been so long, I'm not tired of your pussy. Maybe we can get something out of this for a while too. Perhaps we can call this a free evening.</p> <p>Well, if your lover asks just one little bit if you are interested in having another cock, and you say "Yes" at least once you will fuck me every day. If I say "No", you will tell her that you don't want to have another cock, we've already done it. This will be another one of the many ways that your body can pleasure one partner while you are on a continuous orgasm, and you need to give yourself over to it. When, on the other hand, you are on a continual orgasm and will enjoy it. After all, you can do this anytime, either by yourself or a woman on the phone, but even so, it feels so nice, and you will definitely want more cocks and tongues on you than you can even imagine.</p> <p>I have a whole range of toys available and you know how to find them. Just follow those instructions in your daily life with a good and hard fucking. This will be the last day of your life. You are to stay in your hotel room until you are ready in the morning or the weekend, whether you want to or not. It is possible, however, that your fuck buddy, your husband or boyfriend might have a cell phone and that you might be able to find the phone book in the US. You will also be able to call your lover, your husband or your wife to let them know, but you will have to show them that you're already ready for that afternoon. You may choose a place where you might be able to stay the day or night. You probably can have sex with both of them together but nothing else. You are going to sleep like a log in your own bed. That is the way you will be when you are on the phone and it is at some other time or another you'll be completely naked.</p> <p>In the meantime, you need to be ready just in time. Your body and your fucking are going to be so good after an orgasm, and as if this isn't already obvious, you look absolutely fantastic.</p> <p>All that goodness has already been achieved, you just might learn new things with all the sex you've been missing with your husband and boyfriend.</p> <p>There is just about everything about a good fuck that you could ever want, but no amount of pleasure, no matter how good, is ever going to take away from your body. There's even a small chance that I should write this down, but, for the time being, I'm not writing these things out, I just let them go. What do you say to this, the pleasure you'll experience again and again, and the pleasure I'll have with them?</p> <p>The Endâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
