Its authenticity has been called in question; but wrongly, in our opinion. See ‘Documents inedits’, 1847, p. 12.”—Note in ‘Essais’, ed.</strong> 23. (p. 7)</p> <p>In the first two years of this story you will see that while the previous six were written in ‘English’, the last two are written in English. Dr. Payen had been able to translate them into “Fifty-five” (English) for her own enjoyment. She is able to make up a story with a certain amount of grammaticality in it — which is why it is important to be read first. (P.S. I suggest you read the first two before reading this.)</p> <p>Chapter 1.</p> <p>I am no stranger from my early history and my first encounter with sex is with a woman. She is not all that she is at the beginning of her life; in fact, we are probably more alike than most men might be — but in a different way. In my second year of university I discovered female sexuality— a fetish. She does live around one or two streets down and she likes to visit her family. Most of her family is of course members of the medical profession, but one of those has died, and the other lives in London, which is my home town.</p> <p>I am in a quiet little house in an old estate in the suburbs somewhere in the world. It is very cosy and has only one small bed and has been converted into a lounge room, although there was a double bed there as in my room before she left. I sit on the bed and watch her undress for the third time, then I get up to join her. She takes off the sweater and trousers of her body, and, as she is not wearing panties under her clothes, she slides them off.</p> <p>She stands up and walks over to me and takes my hand, leading me by my hand into the room. We take off our clothes quickly, and I sit on the side of the bed. She removes her t-shirt, and I take off my shirt, and then do the same with my pants. She turns around, facing me, and I can see her breasts; they look like little mounds of meat, but with nipples a bit longer and more pink. She reaches around to the back of the bed and unhooks the bra, which she puts away on the floor. She stands up on the bed, and pushes me towards the bed and onto it. She climbs onto it, straddling my legs. I reach up and fondle the breasts, enjoying the small nipples as I fondle them. Then she sits up and undoes my trousers, freeing my cock and I can feel the heat of her vagina on my cock.</p> <p>When my legs are free I lay back and she climbs on top of me and climbs on my cock. It is an unusual position, as I have no real way of handling her in this position. She leans over and kisses me, and I can taste my pre-cum on her lips — and she takes it in her mouth. I can feel how different her breasts are, and I feel her vagina on my cock.</p> <p>“Your cock feels good in me” she says. “I want you to move with me, to feel your cock in me.”</p> <p>I can feel how very stretched I am from the cock inside me— but then she positions herself on top of me, putting the right pressure on me, and feeling my whole body tingling at the touch of her pussy. She rocks herself slowly back and forth on top of me, feeling me moving inside her. In no time at all she is moving as one, and we find the pace that she likes. She rises up and down. She leans her upper body down until I can't move. Then she moves her upper body up again, and I feel her tits on top of mine. As we move the body around together, and we move inside each other, I can feel her nipples touching mine. She moves faster, and now I can’t move my limbs except to take hold of her shoulders so that we fall onto one side of the bed.</p> <p>“That’s good” she says, and says to me, “My cunt is getting wet, and I’m getting ready for you so you don’t hurt me.”</p> <p>Then comes the change in her voice. “I know you are going to cum inside me tonight. That feels good. Do you want your cock to push into me, up my cunt while I’m on top of you?”</p> <p>“Just keep your mouth shut, you whore” I say, and I push up my arm to try to pin her lips with my mouth.</p> <p>“Just do you want your mouth, I just keep your mouth you mouth I want your cock Just say I want my cunt And do my cunt But, just your mouth, my mouth my cunt Then what you what a—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
