English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>LV. THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY.</h4><p><strong>My mouthpiece—is of the people: too coarsely and cordially do I talk for Angora rabbits. And still stranger soundeth my word unto all ink-fish and pen-foxes. My hand—is a fool’s</strong> hand, and as an equal it’s the same as the other hand.”</p> <p>“It is so,” I say, and with one last push of my hand and one thrust of my cock, I reach forward and take her ankles in hand and hold them while I slip under the sheet and start kissing her ankles. This time there is no resistance from her; it is as though, with her naked and in her legs held open like to a magnet, my cock has her totally and completely entranced in it.</p> <p>We kiss again, and as I hold her wrists she takes them in her own and pulls upward, until we are under the sheet again. Her hands then slide back and down along her legs in mine. We kiss; she holds my ass, I run my fingers along her ass crack, she’s a bit of a virgin, but I know it is no less for her as it is for me, and as her kisses become more insistent and urgent, she reaches between my legs and starts stroking me and it is then I can’t hold back any longer, my cock jerks and shoots a load into the air, and as I watch the next shot I get even more excited and feel the tingle of excitement in my balls. It is only a moment and both of our orgasms come and go, and she finally releases my face and wraps her arms around my neck.</p> <p>After the last spasm and a shudder of pleasure I pull her to me and start kissing my way up her throat. I move forward to her mouth, our lips meet again, and as we kiss I feel her tongue slip past my lips and into mine. I put one hand around her upper torso to pull her breasts hard against me while I kiss her. A quick lick, a nibble on the lower lip, then the right, a pull upward by my hand and a swallow; I want all of that. I pull my lips and tongue away from hers, and she sighs with a groan. I don’t let go and keep kissing and licking her nipples until I finally have one of the small pebbles stand out slightly, and it is my own desire that she feels that it is her nipple that she starts making more and more rigid. I start to kiss and nibble the tip, and she sighs again. Then I start licking her right nipple, and I start to suck, and I hear her gasp; she shoves more of her nipple into my mouth. Then I suck on her left nipple.</p> <p>She pushes herself into my mouth, and I start to run my tongue over both nipples and between them, and then I go down to the little hollow. I want to run my tongue over my finger, and to suck them, but I feel her hand on my head pushing me to the spot where my cock is. A small pressure on my head, and I feel her take a few seconds before she starts pulling my face harder into her. I feel her pull against the head of my cock, and I start to move forward—with her urging, I begin to move forward with her and into her mouth.</p> <p>I do not want to rush it. I want to savor this moment, and I want to savor the taste, the feel, the smell, the smells, and the tastes of this woman who is my wife, and has already given me my first lesbian orgasm and will not be my last; and I want to savor that for the rest of my life.</p> <p>But when I see her eyes flutter and her face tighten with the intensity of passion and in the passion of the passion between us, I want to be her lover. I want to have my penis in her, with it in her, without my touching her except for my fingernails and tongue. I move forward, and then push her down again. She looks at me over her shoulder and then to my hips—I love it when she stares—and I hold myself up against the top of her upper thigh. Her head moves upwards. I can not hold myself back now, and I move a few more strokes to start the journey towards the crown of her vulva, with her sighing each time until my knees go into the air and my cock is sticking out further between her legs. Then I move forward and lay her on her back and move between her legs to start kissing and licking her nipples and vulva, as we have done many times before.</p> <p>She reaches down, her hand on my chest, and she pushes me away. She looks me in the eye, and she smiles a wide. “You have given me yet more pleasure with that tongue and her than you know, and I have never known, I cannot wait for you” she said. I have. I have waited for you.</p> <p>And her eyes had this woman to have waited for I know it well <|<—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
