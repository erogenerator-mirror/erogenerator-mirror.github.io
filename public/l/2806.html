We decided, with the help of our colleagues and parents, that I should tell Paul and Melanie what we had decided. We discussed it carefully.</p> <p>When it was decided that we should act first, Paul stood up from his chair and said, "That's better," he reached into the bottom drawer of the desk, pulled out a large square of condom packet.</p> <p>"Let me open it," and he reached into the top drawer of the desk, handed it to Melanie and then sat down in the same position. Melanie was surprised at the size of the package. She didn't understand until she looked at me and saw that I was reading it out for her. She looked at me with a question on her face but I just said it was fine. I opened the condom and gently wrapped it around Paul's erection. I was fascinated as the clear lubricating gel was formed.</p> <p>I started to put the condom on him and then watched Melanie as she reached over and began to unbutton Paul's pants. "I wish it was easier," Melanie said, "I know we've been married, but this is so exciting."</p> <p>"No, it's not," but I thought I could see that question in Melanie's eyes again. Her mouth and eyes were open as I watched her unfasten Paul's belt and unzip his fly. Paul wasn't wearing underwear, and Melanie's eyes followed as she pulled out his cock, a large, purple, uncircumcised, foreskin, and very prominent helmet. It grew as Melanie stroked him while her mouth made up her mind about sucking him. She didn't take her eyes off him, not even when I'd unzipped her skirt and pulled it over her head.</p> <p>Melanie took the head of his cock in her mouth. I couldn't help but watch, fascinated by the way her lips glided over the ridges of his helmet, the way her teeth grazed his corona, the feel of her tongue and teeth on him. I was mesmerized by the contrast between Paul's softness and Melanie's strength of her lips. They both began to suck him softly, caressing her lips with them, gently sucking and licking the head of his cock. Both of them looked up at me and I watched as Melanie's right hand joined her left and they began to caress me. Their hands found each other's breasts and squeezed them together.</p> <p>Melanie and Paul were now caressing each other's breasts with just their nipples. I couldn't believe how much of a turn-on it was!</p> <p>I took my right hand and unzipped my skirt. Paul's hand followed and he followed me inside my panties. Melanie's eyes flashed.</p> <p>"This is so exciting, Paul," she said, "I can't wait. I can't believe you'd be able to say 'no' to me when we get back home."</p> <p>Paul's answer was obvious. The two of them both unzipped their trousers, slipped their pants down to their boxer shorts and knelt down in the middle of the desk, their erect pricks pointed straight at Melanie. They looked at me, my mouth wide open.</p> <p>I leaned forward and put my lips over Melanie's cock, feeling its hardness in my lips as I sucked it a little. I wanted to taste it as Paul's balls were touching mine. Both of us moaned as I felt Paul's hand slide off my breasts and down my tummy. His finger slid into the sides of my thong and he slid his fingers down my thighs.</p> <p>I heard Melanie say, "This is so exciting," while I had my mouth around his cock, my lips covering the whole length of him before he slipped his finger back up into me. Soon Melanie was sucking me hard, his hand pressing against my pubic bone.</p> <p>I stopped sucking Paul's cock long enough to pull my lips off of him and offer him the condom. Melanie's finger came out and I put my mouth over the head of his cock so I could still feel it in my mouth.</p> <p>Paul gasped when I sucked his cock into my mouth. As I sucked on his erection, Paul whispered into my ear, "You feel so wonderful, you feel so good, so soft and full. I'm going to come. He's going to." His cock tastes you and I want."</p> <p>I looked up at Melanie again, he asked, feeling him. He wanted to take me, he wanted tooâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
