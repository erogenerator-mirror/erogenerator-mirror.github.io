English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>XIII. CHASTITY.</h4><p><strong>I love the forest. It is bad to live in cities: there, there are too many of the lustful. Is it not better to fall into the hands of a</strong> predator rather than to be able to just take a leaf from it? Does it not feel better to be in a forest instead? Are you as a person instead of just the sex? What should I do?</p> <p>My favourite sex novel is The Naked Man from the 1960's from the '70s, it's about a man who has a penis but is just a thing that a woman feels too uncomfortable to have a penis for herself. She thinks, she likes his penis - it's so large that it can't possibly stretch her vagina. And her husband doesn't stretch her; they just can't.</p> <p>She thinks that she can't be a girl anymore, because that's something someone who looks like a girl would do. Yet she doesn't feel the same way about what she's feeling for him... and also not as strongly for a man, she doesn't feel that he's a sex organ.</p> <p>I mean, there's something of that with her. Is that how lovemaking is supposed to be, or are there things like how it should be when a guy fucks a girl?</p> <p>It's not because sex is wrong. It's not because a man has to be a man to do it: sex is more about having fun and, as a girl, it's better if you do it right. You do it right, and it's better for both the girl and the guy. For girls it's better and for boys it's a good thing to give them a good time and to think about what's best for them.</p> <p>If a guy's penis is so big that it hurts, do you want to do a girl first? Or do you want to fuck someone with a penis instead of just giving them pleasure?</p> <p>Do you want it? Or do you want to have sex with someone while kissing another girl?</p> <p>Then just wait for the right moment:</p> <p>"Ooh," she moans as he slips into her, and then it's only sex itself, for her first time, because she doesn't expect him. She closes her eyes and thinks about her boyfriend.</p> <p>This is when he comes in, because she feels how big and hard he is, and she does what she can to keep him going. She closes her eyes, and opens them when he slips out, then she opens them again when she starts fucking him.</p> <p>This is when she remembers her boyfriend's name: Tom.</p> <p>They are both naked and still enjoying themselves. In the dark she can't make out his face: his eyes are closed, his nose is pressed into his hand. She can't tell him what she's feeling: how excited she is. Is he feeling good? Or how excited he is?</p> <p>She's thinking of his penis while she's fucking him: the way her vagina clenches and releases, and if he's looking at her face, or it's his eyes. Maybe he's got a good memory, he's just staring at her.</p> <p>The way her eyes are still closed, how her mouth is open and her lips are spread and the way her clitoris is pressing against her vulva and the way she's holding her hand against his penis - it's the same thing. It's the same thing.</p> <p>There's one more time before he gets off: just hold him, so he can put himself in her as she loves him doing it.</p> <p>Sometimes they'll be in a garden and a waterfall: his penis is pressed against her vagina. Sometimes they'll be walking, and he can't keep his hands off her breasts (sometimes she bends down to pick a flower). Sometimes they'll be looking at one of her magazines: a dapper woman with a good figure, but a big cock too, waiting for something. If he can keep his penis inside her, it doesn't hurt, it's easy, and she can make it as he can. Sometimes he can go to work without her, and he can't keep an eye on her while he does.</p> <p>When she's sucking him or when he's inside her, she can also tell him what she can feel, what she really feels.</p> <p>"Ooh..." she moans. "Fuck me good." And when he's inside she looks down: he's still pumping his erection, hard, even though he's no longer inside her.</p> <p>Do you feel the way that a young man feels when a guy his age enters his woman? It's just his penis: it's no substitute for what you might already feel.</p> <p>"God, do it inside me," she murmurs. "Fuck me."</p> <p>His hand is still pressed against her breasts, so she likes the feel of him in her hands there and it feels warm. He's not as if it's like it's touching her breast with her body, and it's pressing, like her vagina that it's rubbing it's holding her vagina.
