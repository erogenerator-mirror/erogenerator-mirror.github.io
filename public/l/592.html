There were still people in it, perhaps a fiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained, but it was empty. It was empty in the sense</strong> that the air had just turned dry since, it seemed.</p> <p>As it usually did, there was a period of time. People would leave, it couldn't be that busy. People left for work, they left work because everyone just got bored. The usual stuff people did on this place, a TV. People left for dinner or coffee or drink. People left for a movie or television show. It was a busy time.</p> <p>They left in the middle of the night, in their own little world.</p> <p>Sometimes, there were other people nearby. You would hear people snickering at one another, whispering in each other's ears. Sometimes, a young man would walk over there and ask her for a dance, her reply could only be, "Please, I beg you."</p> <p>At least that made a difference in this world you see outside of the usual porn shops and porn movies you don't see everyday, unless it's a family that you live with, alone in a hotel room with another man and a woman. That could happen once or twice in a year. No one had the chance.</p> <p>And that's how it had been back in the old world as well. Back when it was just you and your buddies, there was a time when everyone was a little different, especially if you didn't know people like them. Back then, you hadn't seen anyone, except that woman a lot more. Back then, everyone was just there. Everyone was safe.</p> <p>And you knew. There was a time when there was an empty space between us. Like your life was gone if you didn't know a certain person back then. The time was always changing.</p> <p>You wouldn't know much about this world at the time, other people's lives, but you would know what they did every day that you were back in that world. You could even hear them from across the place. The air was still thick. There were no clouds. Everyone could have been anywhere.</p> <p>But back then, in the old world, you couldn't just be there to take out the trash. You knew how to walk away without looking. In that world, you used to have your car parked near the car park for parking. You didn't see them walking around, but if you had, your whole world didn't know. When you got there, they would just pick up their stuff and get outside.</p> <p>Back then, you could have gotten away without a second look. Back then, you just knew.</p> <p>I think that was why I made all the choices in the past. I just figured it was important for a young man to know that in a sexual context, sex is sex. A good man shouldn't have to look down on a woman or a woman's body when he does that.</p> <p>Now, I know why some of the young men that I had met could go to porn shops, sometimes. Why I wasn't surprised when I'd walk through a window and there would be the woman waiting for him and another man that wasn't really there.</p> <p>No-one knew me. No-one cared if the women there might be, or even if the man in question was gay, or even if he had a girlfriend, or if he did that kind of thing.</p> <p>Back then, if it was something that everyone wanted, something that anyone else wanted, then there was no shame or fear.</p> <p>Back then, those feelings were all gone. There was that part of this place where they could just watch the movie with their friends, forget what they were supposed to be doing.</p> <p>Back then, you weren't worried about anything. At least not until a month later, right before the next decade, when the people in the world who had lived in this place were all going through a period of sadness or boredom.</p> <p>Back then, you used to walk past the men's room of the hotel, even though it was empty. Back then, the men would wait right there for you to come in.</p> <p>When you got your chance, you would see a dozen or so young men in the men's room of the hotel. You'd see their bodies and their faces. You'd see the old woman hanging off of them, naked. You'd see the man that you'd talked to before, maybe his boss in the porno store.</p> <p>As a young man, you'd seen all the men on that site. Even though you didn't know them that well, at least you knew them that well and what they did with their bodies.</p> <p>You didn't know that men and women had sex, how they ate it, which women did it and all the women. You had even seen the pornos, though you had seen a few that women. You didn't know that porno. But as well. They knew everything that, like to be done that you know. So that you too was the things were made you had to know.
