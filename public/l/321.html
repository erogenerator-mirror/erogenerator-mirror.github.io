SEWARD’S PHONOGRAPH DIARY, SPOKEN BY VAN HELSING</h4><p><strong>THIS to Jonathan Harker. You are to stay with your dear Madam Mina. We shall go to make our search—if I can call it so, for it is not search</strong> of a dead person."</p> <p>He walked into the office. As a man in his fifties and twice a decade, Jonathan Harker worked for the government. He was the Director of Special Forces, the guy who got a medal for bravery during the Vietnam War. He was a good man. He was good in bed. He was good in the ass and he was a great lover, both men and women. They were his best and for that I should be grateful</p> <p>I got on all fours and my ass was as sexy as it could be. As it did on the day of the battle—when I got home, of course. It was an ass which would keep me happy and it had always reminded me of my ex-boyfriend, George Clooney in the first place. There was something about him that made it more special. He had always been such a cool, witty, outgoing, funny man. I felt that we were meant to be. It gave me a sense of power. The world had changed and we were still the same.</p> <p>While I was on my hands and knees, humping my ass up at him, like a slut, my body shook with the orgasm that ripped through me that was so intense a memory that I never wanted to get out of it, because I hated feeling that way; a man felt like a woman, a strong-bodied woman who could do anything she wanted and I'm a woman who could do anything she wanted and I'm a woman who loved my body, and I love fucking so much. I was his love, and I always will be.</p> <p>I got dressed and came out of our room as he was getting dressed after dinner as I walked out of the same room. He wore a dress suit, which looked nice on him--a perfect gentleman. We ate a nice dinner in his private dining room, after which my mouth dried up. I had a lot of fun and I was glad to have a good time. I still felt pretty bad for it.</p> <p>I did feel bad that we couldn't find out about my past anyhow, though. All the way home, we were both naked in his bed, but the feeling of him underneath me wasn't lost on me and it was enough to make me feel good.</p> <p>We made love that night. His cock was the hardest I had ever been laid. When he came, well, that was more like the first time, but it got better. When he finished, we kissed. I tasted sex on his breath in the kiss, and it was nice to have him kiss me afterward.</p> <p>But I can't get it out of my mind. The thing that I really like about it is what a cock felt like when it was pumping into my asshole, and what it felt like when the hard cock had filled me up in the right places. He fucked me like that all the time from then on. If I ever wanted more sex, I'd have to say a few words like 'Faster!'</p> <p>Jonathan didn't mind how my ass got fucked. He would take control of any part of it and whenever he was fucking me there was always someone else present. He wasn't a big fan of assplay with my girlfriends, except the hot wife he used to seduce. So he wasn't concerned with getting his jollies from having his cock in that beautiful ass, which belonged to a hot-looking woman whom he'd already conquered with no hesitation.</p> <p>He also couldn't fuck my pussy in it. Not that it didn't seem as good as it did but he'd always tried to get the better of me. In his bed, he'd had sex with me, but only twice in the entire time we were married, and that seemed to be the end of it for the most part of the time.</p> <p>I was lucky to have him. I still wasn't so sure how, but I'd been fucked and it felt really good, so great, so sexy—especially after fucking my best friend for the first time.</p> <p>Now that was a first for me. And what else? I mean, I'd never really done it and I certainly hadn't tried to fake it, let alone do it and get pregnant without even trying.</p> <p>As Jonathan's cock fucked my ass, I kept thinking about him and the hot women we'd have sex with and who'd be at our disposal. What woman would do the things that I had been told I would never do? That one woman who had told me to fuck a black man? That was another woman who I thought was a friend? Why was every man—even with the black one, no doubt. Who would know that it would want a white pussy as well? Oh, I thought. Who'd want to put my black pussy, to get my own it for me a pussy? What other guy to go into my mouth. What my ass. I was what a whore—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
