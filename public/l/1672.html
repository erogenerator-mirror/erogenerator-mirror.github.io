And indeed, even though the occasion was not yet over, it was nevertheless a very, very special occasion for her.</p> <p>They had arranged for her to entertain the host of the party - her husband Edna. After he made a few remarks about how special an evening was, her husband had come inside, and given his friend, Billie, a hand job. Billie had watched her as she walked through the door of the guest room, and had licked and sucked her way up to Edna where Billie was now sitting. Edna had knelt down in front of Billie, and had undressed her naked. Edna had knelt in front of her, and had licked and sucked Billie's pussy until Billie had writhed and cried out. Billie had then licked and sucked her clean, and then had licked and sucked her husband Edna once more, who had been fucking her husband in front of Edna's own parents.</p> <p>The hosts and staff had had a delightful time, and the guests were all present. They had had a fine time, a very happy time indeed. There would be no further interruptions, for what was to come the next night was the culmination of an evening that she had dreamed she would have with Edna, and the event which preceded it had not happened. It was a very, very special evening indeed, and Edna had been especially delighted that she would be invited to it.</p> <p>It was her husband, Billie, who had been fucking her. Edna had licked and sucked Billie's pussy for all she was worth. And it had been an evening that had been very special indeed!</p> <p>The guests had all been very friendly, indeed. One of the male hosts of the party, Billie, had even kissed her. All three had gone to the main party room and had had a lovely, romantic evening all the way there. They had both enjoyed their evening together. They had made wonderful friends.</p> <p>Even though Edna had been so nice to them - at times, Billie was more than charmingly kind and sweet - she had not always appreciated their friendship, or was always happy, at least in public - that she would be invited to a guest party and have the pleasure of being the object of their affection. That is until Edna had kissed her, and told her how attractive they both were.</p> <p>What Billie had not noticed, on her way to the main party room, was that the next evening the guests of the hosts went to bed. A few of the other guests had also gone to bed at that time. Her and Edna had enjoyed a very wonderful time together and had even had several kisses. Of course it was all very private.</p> <p>It had been about midnight, well before midnight when a very happy Edna entered the room of the hostel and looked for her. She was wearing a very lovely red gown whose bodice ended just above her belly button. Billie had thought she had heard the music, for she had not the ability to recognize the voices of Edna and Billie. She had also seen them in the mirror. But she had not been able to see them because she was blindfolded.</p> <p>Edna had felt Billie's hand on her bare skin and then, while her other hand had been busy, her hands were caressing Billie's ass and pussy and her mouth was kissing the nipple of one of Billie's breasts. After a few moments, Edna had felt Billie's hands caressing her butt hole and finger-fucking her vagina. She had also found Edna's fingers and tongue, but she did not know for how long she had enjoyed all she had. She had also had to move quickly because the next day, when it ended, a large party would be having a huge party, and she was supposed to be out of the group that would take the evening off.</p> <p>Edna had felt Billie's hand caressing her face and she had felt her lips kissing her hand, when, in a moment of passion, she had kissed Edna. What she had not counted on was the kiss. It left her breathless and wanting to return the kiss, and she knew that Billie also had felt it.</p> <p>Billie had felt the warmth of Edna's fingers in her pussy, and she had felt her own mouth kissing her fingers as she had kissed Edna. It had felt good, and indeed it had ended as she had kissed Edna for a wonderful time, for once her heart was going a little too fast for her comfort.</p> <p>To Billie's surprise, as it was, that her friend had been the evening, Billie had never had felt the first Edna's kiss without having the touch of another woman's hand on her face and the first a kiss.
