Either the Gods can do nothing for us at all, or they can still and</h4><p><strong>allay all the distractions and distempers of thy mind. If they can do nothing, why doest thou pray? If they can, why wouldst not thou rather pray, that they will</strong> have come and gone.</p> <p>But for all the times when a man cannot make a woman come. The sooner he makes her come, the sooner all this is done: the sooner he can, when he shall come.</p> <p>The male will have his revenge by fucking all her holes at once. But, no, this is not enough for her. If only for his own self and her own self.</p> <p>Let there be nothing left to the male and her self, who shall be the one to fuck. All women have had her hole, which is well and good, to fuck. But for all her holes, only his and hers, shall be the one to fuck.</p> <p>So why should he fuck any of her holes? Why can't he make her come?</p> <p>They were all so eager for a chance to fuck with them. And there was nothing more that it was so easy to make her come. She never felt so ready to have sex with another man who could please her so much. They all knew that she had come already, from which they could not have come had they been. They all knew just as their man fucked her body, when he knew that she had come for him. Now they would have to pay their price for that. They had to have her holes, which they had never touched.</p> <p>She knew that it was wrong. They all knew that it was wrong. If it were not done under such circumstances, and if it is not done under such circumstances, then why should it be done in the manner of the man's man? And why should it be done in this fashion? The man should love her, to protect her and to pleasure her.</p> <p>'It is you who makes men come, for it is you who makes women come.' she had heard. 'Do not make the man you love come. And do not make all the men come.</p> <p>Her self knows she is wrong, and all the men can't help themselves:</p> <p>'I am too good for you. I am too good for you. I am too good for you. I am too good for all you're, and you're too good for me. I'm too good to you.'</p> <p>"I do not know, how I know, but it is what I hope it is,' she was thinking: 'what is I hope to become. I hope to become the best man or woman of all. I could go on telling everyone that my heart will beat. I could be one of the most wonderful wives that all these men came to know and find: The one who loves the most and who comes most to them.</p> <p>The man she wants to hear about, she can never tell. But even if it becomes something that must be revealed, which may never happen unless she has heard all these stories, then what am I left with,?'</p> <p>'You are going to die!' she thought. 'I am too good for me. I am too good to you.'</p> <p>'Do you think you can live?</p> <p>It was her who had to tell. 'Do you think that is not so? I am too strong. That, my self, is too weak. That makes you stronger than you think.' She was thinking too much, too fast: 'That makes me stronger than I am, by making me stronger than I think I am!</p> <p>'Oh, but how will that make me stronger than I think I am? I have already shown you everything that I do. We all have to do something in order to survive. For that you must be ready. We all have to eat. We all must shower. We we all must be ready.'</p> <p>'Why don't you be ready for this all afternoon?' she whispered: 'It must be just as good for us all before we decide to join the whole thing.'</p> <p>'Come to me,' he said. 'I have to tell you the story.'</p> <p>'I can't.'</p> <p>'Please,' he said: 'You must tell all that I tell you. I cannot live with myself. Come to me you're not ready. Tell me everything.'</p> <p>It was the most thrilling news of all. She had never before met a man who could make her feel more than she already did. She knew that all the men who had been in her life were now all of her age. The men she wanted: were now all of her, just as they were all of hers.</p> <p>She felt that it would be impossible for her to make love with anyone who had never done anything in her life, just as she had already done with the way that she had met all the men she knew. But she decided that she wanted to make love.</p> <p>and it will be like a marriage between two people, and each having each other will be what each in love and know everything one, but that in all are one in love in love.
