He saw the sun rising over the mountains with their</strong> first sign of the Sun as their bodies connected. They could feel each other's skin under the sun and he knew they were connected. He looked down on the beauty of her body as his arms slid up her body and his hands wrapped around her body. His mouth found hers as they stood kissing.</p> <p>"Mohan," her body felt heavy, the passion they shared were intense. She looked up at him and kissed him.</p> <p>"Come with me," he wanted her to leave him because of how she looked. "Leave it be in my body, but come with me."</p> <p>Siddhartha smiled in joy as she left his arms and walked him to his bed. She sat down and looked around the bed to see the bed was made from glass. She felt his body as he held her close and they started making love making in the bed. She took her mouth off his and he saw she was looking at him with a look of awe that he did not see on her face.</p> <p>"Mohan," she smiled. She wanted him to join her. The night he showed her how to love another male, when he made her cum from pleasing her, he showed her how to love a male.</p> <p>Siddhartha climbed on his bed and slid her body up to his. She knew exactly what he needed and he knew exactly what to do with her. He took her face in his hands and kissed her lightly. His fingers found her breasts and he rolled them between his thumb and forefinger. He slid his lips over her nipples and sucked them. She ran her hands over his face, neck, and chest. He kissed her neck and the hollow of her belly on his way to her mound. He felt her legs open wider. She was wet again. She could feel the wetness between her legs. It was not sexual, but it felt good. He felt her clench around his fingers, but he did not stop. He could not stop himself, he knew right where to go without touching her pussy. "Please," he heard her whisper.</p> <p>"Yes," he felt her body as his hand slid up her thigh. He was happy to feel that when he touched her there. He felt her body go weak as she came in his hand.</p> <p>He felt her pussy as if his mind came to him. She felt warm inside, there was no turning back. She felt as if she needed him for her love, to take her on a journey that she had never known. He felt himself becoming aroused, it was so beautiful. He wanted to feel her come over his mouth. He wanted to see her come over his lips, in his mouth. The passion was as intense as the kisses and the feeling of her body in his arms, the feeling of her skin on his skin.</p> <p>Siddhartha lay there on him and touched his face and neck with her fingers. She looked him as if seeing him for the first time. Her body seemed to glow with emotion. She looked in his eyes as if asking him if he felt as strong as he felt. He felt it like a pressure building inside him, like a river breaking. Her hand reached up and touched his face. She held him closer. Her head turned towards him and her lips met his. He kissed her. He pulled her body closer to his, feeling her leg over his thigh. He ran his hand over her wet slit. He inserted two fingers into her as the other hand slipped under her and found her clit. Without any warning she started to shake while her body trembled.</p> <p>His hand went back to her. He knew she came as much as she did. He loved her.</p> <p>"Was it alright?" he whispered.</p> <p>"Yeah," she whispered. "It was ok."</p> <p>"How do you feel?"</p> <p>"I felt happy," she replied. He had her in front of him. He wanted her in his bed. He wanted her in more than his bed. He wanted to show her that she did not just love the sex, but he wanted to show her the love he felt for her.</p> <p>"Is it all that you want for yourself?" he felt like asking if she already had. Was she sure? Was it all she wanted? He felt guilty when he asked that.</p> <p>"I want everything," she was almost pleading. "I have always wanted everything."</p> <p>"I am sure everything," he kissed her lips again. Then he pulled her to him and held her again. He moved his body over hers and her arms went around him. Her breast was pressed against his side. Her nipples were hard. His body began to move over and they felt different when he moved closer.</p> <p></p> <p>He felt her body close.</p> <p>Siddha Siddha</p> <p>T</p> <p>T Suddha He moved to me</p> <p>T</p> <p>She moved Sidâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
