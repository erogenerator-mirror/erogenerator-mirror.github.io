He had not even so much</strong> as touched a girl's dress in many months, and was still not ready to have a first time experience of making love to a girl. However, he already had a few more hours before he would have a girl in his bed, so he just knew they had to be his first time.</p> <p>After he left the country in search for one girl he would truly make a difference in his life. He only hoped that she wasn't her. He would take them as his first girl. For the moment, he would just have to leave her. But for the moment, he could always go to her, and make love to her and make her love him.</p> <p>He walked through the streets of Lillocktown, leaving behind him his briefcase. Then he looked around. People are just as busy as he is, and they were happy to greet each other as if no one else existed. He just waited for the next day, he thought. After several more minutes there was a knock at the door, then it opened.</p> <p>She walked in, wearing a long white bathrobe. She looked so sexy, standing there with her hair in her palm. She looked as if she really was a young beauty, standing here in front of a mirror with nothing on except her bathrobe. It made her look so beautiful, and as if she had just grown into that body as much as he's.</p> <p>"It's always hard walking with your bathrobe wet and drying in the warm sunlight." She said, as she started moving in the bathrobe towards him. "You're such a gentleman. So polite and sweet."</p> <p>She walked slowly towards him. Then she pulled the bathrobe slowly off her body. He took a step closer to her. She grabbed his hands, pulling his face close to hers.</p> <p>"Have you ever had an experience like this before?" she asked him.</p> <p>"No." He replied. "First time I've been with the fairer sex? Ohhhhhhhhh."</p> <p>"How was it? It was amazing. You're so big, but so gentle. And it feels so good for you to be gentle with you." She replied.</p> <p>"It's definitely a first time for me. But, it was nice."</p> <p>She smiled, reaching for his hand, pulling it toward her. For the first time in his whole lifetime, he felt that way for his first time. But first time should never be. The best thing was, he realized, to love and cherish him, and make him who he truly am. There were lots of girls, but there wasn't anyone like his beautiful angel.</p> <p>"I love you." She said, before kissing him.</p> <p>As she kissed him, his hands moved to her bare shoulders and began rubbing them, feeling so soft and strong. She made a bit of an impression from there, kissing him and licking his earlobe. As she kissed him her hands began exploring his back and his butt with very soft touches and gentle caresses.</p> <p>Slowly, she removed the bathrobe, leaving her naked body on the bathrobe while he stripped himself. He loved her naked body as much as he loved her. If she would only let him feel her, he would make love to her again, but since they've never done something like this before, he would love to explore her body and make love to her again.</p> <p>"Are you going to do it with me first?" she asked him as she started licking his exposed penis while he masturbated. "That feels so good."</p> <p>"Oh, yeah." He groaned as he leaned over her shoulder and started licking her breast and his fingers exploring her pussy, as if he didn't already do any more than that.</p> <p>She was loving it, as she sucked on his penis while he worked on her pussy. He could feel she was ready to cum as he began fingering her ass while licking her. And, he was happy to be the first to ever put in her ass. So, before she climaxed with him already in her ass, he quickly climbed up from the bathrobe and guided his penis into the center of her vagina, spreading her lips wide open before entering her slowly, all the way to the hilt.</p> <p>She wrapped her arms around his neck while holding him in her vagina. He was on his knees, as he started to move his hips in sync with hers, so they could both get completely engaged in their union. They were one big happy, loving woman. Both experiencing their love for one another.</p> <p></p> <p>"I love me, I love, I love"</p> <p></p> <p>"Make love me I shall always love"</p> <p></p> <p>" love I love we can always</p> <p></p> <p>love</p> <p>" love me, we love</p> <p>love, always love I love</p> <p></p> <p>Love weâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
