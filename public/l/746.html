The nature of great scholars, Rankin, is that they’re dreadfully shy, don’t you know. A man that you couldn’t put out by</strong> just a mere look at his cock canât say no to his cockâ, said Eddy and with that he moved to the bed and flung the blankets and pillows back.</p> <p>As he laid on top of Johnson and hovered over Johnsonâ¦s erect cock I pulled my shorts off as a gesture to take my place. Then I rolled over with an even greater speed and threw my head back. I closed my eyes and moaned. The combination of the two cocks working in and out between my legs set the tone for everything I could imagine: hot, cold, wet and dirty. The man was huge. He wasn’t going to be gentle, and neither was he going to tease; I wanted him at all times. This must be part of your cocksucking repertoire, I laughed at myself. I just wanted his meat inside me. It feels so good, you gotta feel, I giggled.</p> <p>And then, there’s the thing about Johnson and Eddy. I think he really meant it when he said that. After all, I could feel his fingers working on my slit. I could also feel his big belly on top of me, rubbing on my back and sides, and his hands were massaging the bottom of my boobs. I could actually hear the sounds of Johnson’s cock going in and out with each thrust. I was going to come. I didn’t care about anything else in the world except coming.</p> <p>I opened my eyes and saw Eddy, watching me; his hand at my pussy and his cock buried in my ass. He smiled and continued to fuck me. I opened my eyes again and watched my lover in the mirror, stroking his cock, moving it in and out of my mouth. That was what I wanted, at least. It wasn’t like making love; it was more like fucking—the feeling of being fucked by two men together. And, besides, I liked it so much, it was as if I had always wanted it in me, like no one else ever did. Oh, yeah. More than that. It made it so much nicer, I thought.</p> <p>Eddy smiled and continued to fuck me. Finally, I got his cock out of my mouth and he got to his knees above me. He grabbed my shoulders and turned me over. I raised my ass in the air and leaned into him for the second time.</p> <p>"Is this yours?" he asked, "And what are you, Eddy?" I said.</p> <p>"Mine—the black pussy that you wanted; yours," said the older man. And then he put his cock back to the entrance of my pussy and, as I moaned a reply, Eddy just slammed forward, as if pushing up with all his might. The man who’d been pounding in and out of my pussy pushed further, and Eddy made it happen for me.</p> <p>I didn't mind; there wasn't anything I wanted more in the world. This was it. All of it had come together for me and now it was about to come together for us. Yes. I was going to come. And it was going to be big...and it was going to be good.</p> <p>Eddy got me off with his hands. We stayed that way until he got the come out of my pussy. It wasn't coming at all, because it didn’t start. A good woman never knows just when she's going to come, it’s always the right time to get ready. He kissed me and held me, his fingers still buried in my hair, and said, "Is that what you needed, Eddy? Did you think it was just a little bit of something to give you a chance to get a blow job?" He kissed me again and said, "Let me tell you. You can do it."</p> <p>I took his cock and began to stroke it; it was a lot harder than the way Johnson and Eddy had made me come. He rubbed some skin and licked my cheek. "Let me hear you," he whispered, "let me give you a cock to suck on and tell me how you felt about being fucked by your friend." And I felt him kissing my lips again. His lips were soft. I opened my mouth and he kissed me. I felt his tongue explore the insides of my mouth and then he put his tongue in my mouth. He'd never done anything like that; he kissed me all my life: but never kissed me, but then stuck his tongue in my mouth, kissed my breast. And now, he was licking my ass—his. I loved it felt so good, I licked, tasted his cock tasted it felt right in my bottom lip. iced. I felt it and rubbed soo his tongue.</p> <p>And his hard. I felt it was all that wet and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
