If this neither be my wicked act, nor an act anyways depending</h4><p><strong>from any wickedness of mine, and that by it the public is not hurt; what doth it concern me? And wherein can the public be hurt? For thou must not</strong> hide in the darkness of hell. and for the souls of the world is the most sacred act of a woman’s soul.</p> <p>And when we were naked in the bed of a lover, when we were in her embrace, when we did it that way, because we were in the dark of her imagination, and because God’s love was holy and adoring, we were the perfect lovers and in love, in love, and yet as he did make beautiful love to me, and as he did her to me, we were not perfect; we were meant to be made to be.</p> <p>In the dark of her imagination, how did they make love, and how do they use such good magic? How does my darling daughter know how good a lover she is with that wonderful loving of hers!</p> <p>I don’t know how I must feel this day. This one afternoon, with the knowledge that we had been caught in her fantasies, for she told me she had dreamed of letting me make love to her, and to have me in her bed, and that she wanted it again. She was lying down on her side of the bed, with me between the soft mounds that formed the back of her pillow. With my hands, my fingers, all of her, I made sure every nook and crevice and crevice was wet with me and what I was doing. I made sure that my cock was hard and throbbing, and I made sure that my lips were on hers, kissing, and licking every part of her, just as always. The taste of her mouth must have been great. She tasted like strawberries, and her own sex, and was her body mine. Then I moved her arms down to my chest as I wanted them to be behind her knees, and I covered her, as I wanted to be covered, as she wanted be; and, without taking my lips from hers, I moved my tongue into her mouth, and slowly pulled my tongue from her mouth to start kissing. Then while we were kissing, I rolled her over on to her back. My kisses continued on her breasts and tummy, just as she liked them done to hers, and I wanted to tell her that it was the best thing that I had ever done to her.</p> <p>Then she pulled my head to her breasts, pulling me on her, as our kiss continued to intensify. While I felt her breathing deep and fast, I could feel that her breasts were rising and falling from her chest against me. I sucked first one breast then the other, trying to get as much of her breast into my mouth as I could. I continued to suckle each breast, in turn, for I knew that the feeling would drive her wild, as she would get wilder before I did. Her breathing started to get faster. The wetness of her pussy was getting steadily wetter. I knew that I was not touching her pussy; I was just kissing her body.</p> <p>We must have been in a state of bliss, for by now we were both breathless. We were both aware of one another’s naked bodies as well as our surroundings. The kisses continued on to her lips and down her chin. Then we kissed again. I knew that we would be lost in the sensations of that first kiss, but for what? for what? Because I wanted to feel her tongue licking my lips and my teeth.</p> <p>We kissed on to her breasts again, kissing as if our mouths were meant to be together. I knew that my tongue would be working its way from her breasts to her nipples, to her tummy, to her belly button, and her pubic mound.</p> <p>Our kissing continued as I felt her softness against my face and between my lips. I took her nipple into my mouth and sucked it until she moaned and cried out, as if she was in a dream-like state of bliss. Then I took her nipple and sucked it till she cried out one more time. I thought that if I had ever been that close to a climax, it was with her, but I certainly did not want to let her come down.</p> <p>So I kissed her again, while I still suckled her nipples. I could feel her breathing again, and could see that she was as wet as she would get. Then, I took her nipple into my mouth. At first it hurt a bit. But, after we had kissed, we stopped to make up our minds just how much we were enjoying this time together.</p> <p>After a moment or two of that, she took my face in hers and pulled me on top of her, and kissed me again.</p> <p>I can tell that she had a feeling of happiness that was very different from the feeling of dread during our first kisses. And I think that I must have had a feeling of sadness, just as strong as hers and her.</p> <p>Then I felt that we were all of our naked bodies were united. She spread out beside me and mine. in the kisses were touching and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
