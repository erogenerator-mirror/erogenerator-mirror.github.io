"Make it a good, beautiful orgasm. We'll know it when we get here."</p> <p>"Good God! That's a long one!"</p> <p>"The fuck you say!"</p> <p>"Be thankful that you're standing in all the glory of the universe."</p> <p>"I'm glad that you gave me those orgasms. I feel so fucking good. Just like you did with David at the park."</p> <p>"You know, you gave me more orgasms than I wanted to know how I felt. You sure felt good. I know because of that fucking you gave me."</p> <p>My husband, David, has told me many times that he thought that I was going to get pregnant. David has no doubt that I am on the pill. He doesn't even know that I knew that I was on the pill until right before he proposed to me five months ago. Maybe he thinks that if it had been a perfectly normal time for me to have sex with him, instead of the one he had in his mind, that I should probably have taken the risk to go through this one experience before I had a better chance to go on with David. I was glad that he had waited as long as he had to.</p> <p>"Don't hold back," he told me. "Please, baby, don't hold back until we can have these two, to give us all those orgasms of our lives."</p> <p>"Thank God," I said.</p> <p>While fucking me, David took off his clothes and sat in the big bed next to me. I saw that he was about 35 years younger than I was. He still had that nice build and a nicely trimmed beard and mustache, but he had gotten it a little more grey. When the first erection of his new sexual partner approached as he lay next to me on the big bed, he looked like a guy that had been in a daze for a very long time. And he had an impressive cock too. We were both well over forty when we joined the couple that was already making love to each other. I had my first erection in the same bed, and it wasn't all at once, but when I felt David's cock enter my wet vagina, I started to cum. David's cock, as I remember him doing, brought me to a climax of my own, and I felt him ejaculate more ejaculate than mine. After we had finished fucking, I lay beside David and we fell asleep.</p> <p>The next day, Wednesday afternoon, he went swimming again, and I watched through the window as he walked around the pool, with his cock in hand, and swam at an easy pace across the pool. My pussy was already starting to feel wet and I didn't know if it would be enough to get him hard. With his cock in hand, David reached around behind him and started stroking his own cock. I watched him for awhile, and then he lay on his back on the side of the pool. I took him into my mouth, and he didn't last long. Having him in the middle of sucking my pussy and his hand on his cock really got to me. David came and came and cummed, but he didn't even seem to want to pull out of the pool. Finally, he made me orgasm with him, but I didn't really care. His cum tasted pretty good, though.</p> <p>When Saturday came and it was dark, David picked me up and took me to the park. I was wearing my bikini, which only came a bit higher than the sunbathers that David had chosen to be nude all the time. There were people all afternoon, even the mothers, watching the two of us as we sat on the beach and played games with the children. I got quite the crowd, though.</p> <p>When, just before lunch, I saw David sitting at one of the table, eating, and I walked toward him with David's semen all over my hand. It made me feel pretty hot and bothered and jealous. I kept my skirt on, but kept seeing his cock.</p> <p>When we got back to his house, we fucked him a couple, we got in a threes the third. We made love before we went to work. We went from first. After work and as partners as partners.
