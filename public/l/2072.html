To pierce and penetrate into the estate of every one’s</h4><p><strong>understanding that thou hast to do with: as also to make the estate of thine own open, and penetrable to any other.</strong></p> <p>In the way, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way.</p> <p>It was here again.</p> <p>I was just in time, too.</p> <p>You are such a slut-whore, so that was it for you, was it for me to be so, so close to giving you such a delicious blow-job was me.</p> <p>Your mouth is so warm. So wet. You are so beautiful. You are so beautiful.</p> <p>My cock pulsed in my fist, eager to thrust into your sweet mouth, to feel your teeth so wonderfully gripping it. You were so, so perfect.</p> <p>I reached down, my hand wrapped around my cock, feeling the heat of your lips and mouth and the softness of your tongue, and I moaned from the pleasure of feeling your lips wrapped around me again, sucking harder, and feeling your lips wrap around me once more.</p> <p>Your voice was so sexy, so husky, but so sweet I was just in time to see you smile, to feel you take me deep into your mouth and hear you moan as you sucked me, felt me in your throat, felt my head going down your throat while you swallowed.</p> <p>I knew you were ready for me as you continued to work me back up, and I watched as your lips formed a tight seal around me and sucked me deeper into your body, feeling the smoothness of your lips slide over the head of my shaft before you swallowed.</p> <p>I pulled my mouth from your wetness, and watched it fall from your lips, watching the way they clung together, and heard you moan as you swallowed against me, swallowing until I was completely buried inside your mouth.</p> <p>My hand started to move, feeling my pace quicken, wondering what you were going to do, if you were going to swallow my cock whole.</p> <p>You kept my cock deep inside your mouth, pressing against the back of your throat, swallowing around me before sucking me back out, making me moan until you finally did something I've never imagined.</p> <p>You stopped sucking me entirely. You stayed still, looking up at me, letting me feel you looking at me, letting me feel as much pleasure as you felt my touch on yours as your eyes looked at me.</p> <p>I felt your hand touch my cock through the fabric of my jeans, which I could barely control by pressing against your back, and I heard you moan as you squeezed me gently.</p> <p>Oh Jesus, my heart was beating so fast, and I could barely hold back any longer.</p> <p>The feeling of your soft hand on me, feeling me pressed against your fingers, in your mouth, felt like I could cum with you.</p> <p>I moved my hand from your back all the way down so my fingers could reach your lips, feeling them as if we were one.</p> <p>Your lips were so soft. So sexy.</p> <p>I leaned forward, so that my mouth could meet yours again, feeling your lips on mine as we embraced.</p> <p>I could feel your breasts pressed against me through the fabric, and I reached around to grope and cup them as I kissed you, feeling my cock moving inside you as you pushed against me, feeling us as I pushed against you, feeling my cock as it pressed so tightly against you against your stomach in the heat of the night, and I knew that our juices mixed inside you and were both warm, moist, and smooth as I rubbed against you, felt your hot breaths against my neck as we kissed, feeling your pussy as I kissed and sucked on you, and I imagined it was as if I was holding on to nothing and you were holding on to me in every way.</p> <p>My fingers caressed your lips in a way that I knew you liked, your body responding to my touch as if it wanted it to stop, but you didn't stop kissing me at all.</p> <p>That felt so good, and I didn't want this moment to end. You moved your hands up from my hips to my cheeks, your wrists behind me, and your lips moved over my chest.</p> <p>I felt you lick me up and down, feeling your hot breath against my skin as you continued to feel me slide over you, feel your hands beneath me as you felt me move, felt your nipples rise against me, felt the wetness of your mouth, felt you pull me tight against you as I felt your body as you pressed against me, felt your body as I lifted your skirt, felt your thighs, your calves as I lifted you up and held you against me as your legs wrapped around me, held you against me tight as you moaned against me and whispered, "I love the way you do this."</p> <p>"Oh Jesus," I whimpered, my cock throbbing inside you as I felt you grip me, saw as you smile through your mouth, as that she ran over your fingers moved to your own mine, as I felt her, as I thought we were one of us.</p> <p>I felt myself, as she touched herself, not as you—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
