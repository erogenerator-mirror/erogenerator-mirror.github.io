So it was time to fuck her.</p> <p>Sir Walter, a well preserved man who lived only in his own flat, was on all-fours, his trousers pulled down to his knees as he stood and his prick at the ready, to the delight of the female guests of his home. It would only be difficult to be as hard. It is quite possible to be stiff when you are very stiff but, as Sir Walter got naked and, like the male of the species, he got his prick ready.</p> <p>It was time. Very soon he was erect and he sat on the settee; there was a mirror to the side and the Baroneties were all coming towards the door!</p> <p>Sir Walter had got over his embarrassment during the time that the Baroneties had been watching him, that embarrassment had diminished, and was replaced by great desire to fuck his own neighbour, and this was that! There was a man there, a man who he knew was looking at him, a woman who had her head cocked back and was moaning and, in his opinion, looking at his prick as it went in and out as he fucked himself vigorously on the settee. Now the Baroneties were standing too. And, Sir Walter was going to get his prick in them!</p> <p>He had his prick in one hand and he started to jerk himself off as he bent down, took hold of his own prick and started to pump it into himself, the male of the species could understand the need, perhaps his excitement, and thus the pleasure, the desire, the desire is a woman needs for her husband's cock.</p> <p>And of course the woman was there, standing behind him, and all the attention of the women's eyes! The sight of the other cock being serviced sent Sir Walter out of control and the Baroneties began to groan and pump their cocks! Sir Walter was now fucking himself in his wife's cunt, his own member going into a state of hardness and almost ready to burst.</p> <p>Then he heard himself cry out:</p> <p>'Oh God!'</p> <p>He felt the power of his orgasm, felt the energy and the violence of his ejaculation as it erupted into his wife's cunt. His prick jerked furiously at the other end of the other settee and his sperm flew down his prick, over his balls, over his hand and the chair that he was on. Then the Baroneties were walking into the room, their wives all looking like, and it was now clear that, despite the apparent state of their cocks, they were all ready for their evening! And to make matters worse the Baroneties, who had seen his climax as he came up to the settee, came to the side; there was a smile from the women; an acknowledgement from Sir Walter that it had all been his idea!</p> <p>'Well then, as you can see my prick is still going!' He shouted!</p> <p>The women were still looking, he could plainly see the shape of their cocks in their skirts as, after what the Baroneties had witnessed, they were beginning to have difficulty concealing their arousal, still being erect and standing proud as their cocks. Their skirts were now around their waists, so that they could see each other's private parts.</p> <p>'Well, shall we go on a toast then?' He looked down at their skirts which were round their waists. 'I believe we will start that way!'</p> <p>'Very well then, gentlemen, as you can see I am, myself a very private person, as is the Baroneties.'</p> <p>'Oh, I don't believe that. I didn't think so.'</p> <p>'Well, gentlemen, I think we are all ready to start that way! The best thing about being a man is that your cocks are always hard enough that you don't need to hold them! You can still enjoy sex, but it just takes a bit of getting used to. If you could manage to keep a couple of stiff pricks in your trousers you can, of course, still enjoy it without having to go with the rest of the guys! Now, gentlemen, I think that we should get it off the settee so that the boys will be able to go somewhere else and then we can go to the kitchen for something to eat and, to be honest, we might just join in the fun! We'll be able to all feel the sexual pleasure that is given by our cocks, gentlemen!'</p> <p></p> <p>'We'll have tea, or rather, together on our hands!' said Sir Walter, and 'ours.' said, said 'ourâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
