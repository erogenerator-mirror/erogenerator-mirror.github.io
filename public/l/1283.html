The Fifth of September</h4><p><strong>The extension provided for by the agent of Thomson & French, at the moment when Morrel expected it least, was to the poor shipowner so decided a stroke of good</strong> fortune to use a propol that had been hidden in the back yard. It had been a very difficult day for the shipowner. At first he had thought it a propol when he had been trying to protect an old ship, but as one day he had learned that it wasn't much. At night he sometimes had a little trouble sleeping and when he got up it was almost always a dream. Even though he never made himself come, although he tried. So Morrel had found it quite easy to make up for lost sleep. It was his favorite activity of late.</p> <p>Sometimes during nights of troubled thoughts, he couldn't stop thinking about his own mother, a beautiful, naked woman. And he usually did his worst even though his thoughts tended to turn to sexual dreams for a very short time. But now he was coming back with an idea. Maybe in the time when Morrel was most busy she could go to her room, remove her habit and maybe then he could make himself come over to his bed. The idea was quite scary. Of course he didn't know then but he knew by the time she went to her own room. Maybe if they had both decided to stay in their rooms she could be a secret. He remembered how she kept her secret that way. He remembered how sexy she was. But now he was coming back to realize.</p> <p>After the stroke of good fortunes he should have gone to the sea, but a lot of sailors are too polite, but Morrel wasn't one of them. Even the captain and crew were a little too polite, and she shouldn't have been doing this. Especially when she was wearing something that was scandalous. He should have just gone to the ship. But for the Captain and the crew he didn't have to go to the sea. Morrel knew how to get them to go to the sea, or leave it up to him. She didn't know he wouldn't. But they did. And she was the captain's willing slut. That was how she found it fun to talk dirty to someone and use her tongue on another. Morrel made sure they were at the sea soon after learning how to speak French. She felt so dirty, her voice sounded like dirty. She also got the guys to talk dirty sometimes while they used their tongues. That's what really turned them on, telling others what a dirty sluts she was and how good they made her feel.</p> <p>Morrel always took a special interest in the sailors. Not only was she a great slut, she always wanted to be seen as something other man than the sailor, because she seemed to know how to please any man. She had to have a huge set of tits, but she could also take care of that. And once in a while she would have her husband and son to talk to about it. One of those times he had had his wife and her husband. Morrel wondered to herself how easy it would be to get the two of them to tell the sailor what they wanted to say. Morrel knew if both of them talked it up they would have fun. Maybe it was because there were sailors that used to love the idea of sharing her with men. But most sailors never could be so open. Or so naïve.</p> <p>But when Morrel was still a very young man her favorite thing was to get her husband to put his cock in such a way to try to talk her up. Of course that was not quite how it started, but it gave her a certain thrill, even if it never happened before. And she had never done it before anyway. Maybe that was normal in a girl that was as horny about sex as she was. There was always something so wrong with all the sailors. But there was certainly something wrong with the idea even though Morrel had never done it. Of course she wouldn't just blow any sailors. She wouldn't just tease them and show them off to their friends, to anyone who had a hard cock, to any sailors, and to anyone who made a sailor jealous. She would make them feel wanted, wanted even. But she would never do anything to her husband with it.</p> <p>Of course she would never do anything with the Captain or any sailors. But Morrel wondered sometimes why a sailor would want to talk to his wife in such a way. She would never want to do anything with him that way, and then she had to get to it. She always wanted the best for him. She was a sweet, beautiful, desirable young woman. But she probably was a little more of course than some sailors were. When it came to sex it was never the easy thing. Morrel often fantasized about being the Captain's personal slut. Morrel wondered how it would feel in her to have a sailor at least a couple of sailors to have her, like to have one man that she and one of them, to have sex. Morrel was a lot or the love to all.
