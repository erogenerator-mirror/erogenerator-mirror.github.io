We blame the church when she is saturated with intrigues, we despise the spiritual which is harsh toward the temporal; but we everywhere honor the thoughtful</strong> individual which has given life to both.</p> <p>Time to fuck.</p> <p>And so the fucking happened after we were released from prison. That, my fellow inmates, should have been clear. They are my personal fucking slaves. The time of the year was in December last year and it was my last two months in prison for good, in the year before that was the holidays. It was my last month to die on the inside. But the fucking is not the fucking. The fucking is the fucking.</p> <p>"You look so sexy," the man said as he sat beside me.</p> <p>"What happened here?" I asked.</p> <p>"You were in prison for twelve months. The prison is not a free society. It is a prison with no morals. I guess I'll never go back," he said.</p> <p>"What happened to you?"</p> <p>"They put me in charge of these prisons. I don't own anything here. This prison is my own cell. I'm a slave. I'm free. I am all your fucking choice."</p> <p>There was something in his voice, too, but only slightly, like a growl from deep in his throat. I felt something of that to him and it scared me to the bone. I was afraid for the safety of our young people. If I went back inside the prison after our first year, it should have been one of the more secure ones in the world.</p> <p>He was right. The prison was an institution of torture and I was about to walk a line at the hands of three men. They were big and handsome, white and black, with waddling feet and wiry, muscular backs and arms. It was all I could do to keep quiet and fight the urge to run after them, knowing I had to do as they said and to do it as quickly as I could.</p> <p>I did not know how they were going to handle me. What if I was caught? They would lock me up for life and I would walk the line somewhere else because what I wanted was to be free. Why? Because I already wanted, for once in my life, but I was never going to be free. It would never happen again. I could give myself to them without ever giving up. They did that to me at the first time.</p> <p>"They said you had the body in there," the man continued.</p> <p>I looked down to see the man of the small group had a tent tent in his face, which caused my heart to palpitate. The only reason I was in this prison was to get back in my own. I was trapped in the darkness which could only be my own. I was not a slave, and the freedom had failed. Now I was going to die. I was getting worse and I couldn't stop the tide of death from taking me over.</p> <p>"Do you know what happens in prison?" I asked him.</p> <p>"What makes you think?" he said angrily. "That it would never happen again? That you're not going to die? The other inmates, they would die and they wouldn't. It's that they would die from it."</p> <p>"It's horrible to have to go behind your back. I could do anything."</p> <p>"I would never go behind behind my back just for that," he said. "I can do that."</p> <p>"You're not going to die. Maybe you can get out of it, but if you keep going by me, you'll never be free. We'll get rid of you eventually, but for now you must stay here, alone."</p> <p>"Why would I leave," I asked again.</p> <p>"They don't know what we are. We're different. You are new to prison, from the people you came to see. You are new to them, but they may take you in and make you their sex slave. You may be free, you may make this man your slave, but you must not. You must stay here, for one final thing. Do you understand?"</p> <p>"Yes," I replied. "Whatever happens, whatever happens, I will never leave this prison."</p> <p>"Do you realize how lucky we are," he said. There was a hint of anger in his voice. I looked down again when I realized he was asking me if I knew or understood how they were going to dispose of me.</p> <p>"You can't be sure you know what to do with this man." I tried to put it out of my mind the way I had just said it. For a moment he looked as if he was going to hit me once again.</p> <p>"He wants me to be his sex slave for a month," the man said sharply. "Do you." and a moment we saw the look of determination return to him as though. "this man again. the man again and all changed. I thought. You need for him out.
