To be able to go a thousand miles he must imagine that something good awaits him at the end</strong> of the passage. He knew there were other reasons he could do so. There isn't really, but there are and he was going to make sure they weren't. It was a very important goal to be, a goal, because it was the goal of any kind of good that he might be able to achieve.</p> <p>It didn't help that once he was inside her ass she stopped protesting long enough to push him backwards, so he got a hand on the cheek of her ass. "That is better. It'll help me get more into you."</p> <p>"Fuck, I feel like that was just another thing to do on my lunch date today. Your ass feels good."</p> <p>His cock began to rise to attention as she spread her cheeks and rubbed the underside of the head along the back of her anus.</p> <p>"It does?"</p> <p>Her eyebrows knitted with the sudden realization that only the head of his prick might enter her. "It certainly does, now I'll need a big hole that accepts me. I don't know where he was supposed to be but he did."</p> <p>The thought sent a wicked thrill through him and he pulled out. He didn't even ask why. They fucked in the moonlight. It was only a few minutes later when his hands grabbed her ass and he filled her back door. It wasn't long after that that she felt him pushing against her hole and she stopped pulling back to feel that head slowly pushing into her ass.</p> <p>She had a tight ring around the base of his prick and he knew it meant he would just stay there.</p> <p>"Please fuck me," she mewed as he pushed into it more, but he continued to hold her tight until just outside her anus he pulled out and slammed back in again.</p> <p>"Oh fuck," she gasped.</p> <p>He pulled back until only the tip of his prick was inside her, then thrust into her again. His body slapped into hers with no effect on her.</p> <p>"What's that?" he groaned.</p> <p>"It's you," she hissed through clenched teeth. She didn't seem happy.</p> <p>Her ass felt better than he could have ever imagined but she was a bit sore. He began to pound her ass again. His hands grasped her waist and he pulled her back. His body pressed into her as he pumped with more vigor than he'd ever done before. Each time the base of his prick plunged into her hole his erection began to pulse inside her ass. His body began to slap against hers in the moonlight and the moonlight began to wash down the back of her legs. The sound the sound made wasn't like a porn flick she made, but she made it sound like it sounded real. The sound of their bodies slapping together and the sound filled the night.</p> <p>"Oh, God, fuck me," she moaned. "Fuck me so good."</p> <p>"Yes," he groaned, feeling her ass tighten around his cock again. A hot stream of his ejaculate shot out onto her back, the rest squirting into her ass. With each ejaculation he felt her ass get even tighter. A few seconds later his prick grew still inside her until it began to soften. It was a moment before he could move again.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, that felt sooooo good," he gasped.</p> <p>"It felt good to me too," she murmered, then added "but what about you?"</p> <p>His dick got a firm twitching as he moved again, but then he was hard again. He could only manage to hold back a few seconds before he ejaculated again.</p> <p>That was about the last thing she said before drifting back to sleep. She looked a little guilty that she had enjoyed it more with him than she had ever done before, but there was only pleasure for them both.</p> <p>"I guess we better get going."</p> <p>He did. "Maybe we should take our clothes off."</p> <p>"Oh, sorry."</p> <p>She pushed herself forward as he rose up for another round of lovemaking. This time they fucked twice as hard as before, but his prick just slid in and out as quickly as it had been before, and when he rolled over after they came the head slipped out of her ass. His body glided along hers as he slid his cock back inside her, but now he pulled back to put it in her mouth, which she eagerly did.</p> <p>"I don't know what you're talking about," he grumbled. "Did you enjoy it?"</p> <p>"No, I liked it," she sighed contentedly. She lay there for several minutes, enjoying the feel of him inside of her, feeling his hand on her breasts, wondering which would get wet with her semen.</p> <p>"God, I'm sorry, I shouldn't usually when I'm wet when you're like to be like this?"</p> <p>"Don't," he'd likeâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
