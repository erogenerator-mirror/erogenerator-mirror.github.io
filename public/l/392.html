It was growing dark and the glow of</strong> distant ships sent from the moon's outer corners. The air itself was soft but the sound of heavy metal drums and drums could be heard on the radio. It was the kind of night your first time, the kind of night where you'd wake up in a hospital bed and someone's voice would say, "I am so glad you're awake, buddy," you'd find someone's voice, then make your way out to your first-person-only sex, that's who you'd leave alone. Then you'd do things you'd want to do first-time, for your next sex, for your next sex, for your next sex, for your next time, for your next sex, because every time was your, and not the last.</p> <p>"Good-night lover," you'd say, to yourself. And what if I were here? What if someone was here with me, with us, with us again? What if I was here with you and I didn't have to tell you. This life could take us back to this Earth, over the next year. After the next year, before your next period, before your next period, before your periods, before your periods, before your periods, before your period, before your periods, before your periods, before your periods, before your periods. Just imagine if I were there with you, if I were here with you, before your next period, before your next period, before your monthly periods, before your periods, before your monthly periods, before your monthly periods. Just imagine if I was there with you, before your first, and last, sex? Just imagine if I was here, before your first, and last, sex.</p> <p>"Good-night lover, I'm right there somewhere, lying next to you." She was smiling, her eyes had turned to me. "Good-night lover."</p> <p>I woke up early. As I lay there next to her with my lips covering her nose, I started to get hard again, even though she still wasn't awake but I didn't care. If I thought I could get hard again, even in an attempt to sleep but this time something was wrong, I'd be in a hospital bed with a nurse. She was waiting for me, smiling, her eyes open like the moon in the sky.</p> <p>"Good-night lover," I whispered. I took her face in my hands. I kissed a line down her cheek to her chin. "Good-night lover." I whispered again, and again, and her face softened into smile. "Good-night lover." She was still smiling. And I felt her smile. And for the next couple of hours I kissed, touched and caressed her until I couldn't help myself. My hands were all over her, feeling, feeling, squeezing. She took charge when I touched her, when my fingers slid down and over her breast, and when hers were on my cock again. When her legs opened and I was inside of her, I was in full-blown heaven. I never felt so alive and in control without my penis inside of her. It was like being in a trance, letting our thoughts and memories do all the work. And now I was free, being able to feel her breath, smell her body, and feel the heat of her body. She was warm, and her skin was soft to the touch. So, I had to take everything in. I had to take everything out. I had to take control. I had to take her.</p> <p>Chapter 2</p> <p>It was the first time I'd ever had intercourse in my life in a hospital or in a hospital operating room; and, it was the first time for some of those things we did before we got married. It was the first time I've ever thought about how good sex should be - and it was the first time that had come together to have sex. I loved having sex. I couldn't get enough of sex; I just couldn't get enough. We were the first couple in years, the first couple in my life as a couple, I knew I'd married a woman of my desires but I didn't care, I wanted sex and it was sex. I wanted her like I always wanted her and I guess I was the right choice in that respect and I wanted to bring her back to that life.</p> <p>Maybe she felt the same way. Because there were only two things, and that's because it was the second thing.</p> <p>As I walked towards her, I didn't wait for her to rise up to greet me; I just stood there looking down at her. She was watching me and smiling. I was surprised at her reaction to my appearance. She was the one of beauty and I'd expected from her, she was that of what I was a beautiful. She was something to me. Maybe I'd become the beauty I looked like the other. I was she'd be, like she should be. I was.
