Of Sextus, mildness and the pattern of a family governed with</h4><p><strong>paternal affection; and a purpose to live according to nature: to be grave without affectation: to observe carefully the several dispositions of my friends, not to be offended with idiots,</strong> so they should come along, so that I can enjoy each person. Not so to waste my time on stupid crap. It's not like I'm an idiot.</p> <p>I got up, and got out of bed, and went about my morning routine. I'm such a lazy thing. This morning I was going to do the daily wash and I'm really feeling a light jog in the shower. I had a feeling about today that it was going to be great.</p> <p>I came down to the kitchen to grab my breakfast plate, because I was famished. I found my breakfast: eggs, sausage, hash browns, sausage, and hash browns with sausage. It was pretty good. I wanted to eat so much. I made the breakfast and put my plate on the table: I then took out the eggs and sausage and started eating; that was it; and then I ate.</p> <p>I finished my breakfast, went into the living room to collect my books, and then out the door. I went to the library and collected my books and then the textbooks: I did the math homework on the last one. I collected my textbooks and went home.</p> <p>When I got back to my room I was glad my books hadn't spilled out on the floor; I had never felt a kind of happiness at my class. I sat on my bed, not bothering to get my book bag. I didn't want to be anywhere else. This is the second day of school. It was very late and for some reason I felt really tired. I felt the sun was high, the wind was brisk and the sky was cool. A light breeze was blowing lightly across me, and the sound of rain coming was strong in the background. Of course I didn't get a chance to take any sleep because my mind was playing tricks on me. If I kept on thinking such naughty thoughts I could get into some trouble.</p> <p>I went to the bathroom at that time and cleaned up. I threw open the door, and then started walking inside the bathroom. What happened to me the other day? It was such an embarrassing thought. I was thinking so naughty thoughts, like to have sex with my girlfriend. It was such an awkward and embarrassing and shameful thought. Did I do that to myself when I was young, to have an orgasm while thinking that I can't have, and then make it more embarrassing.</p> <p>The next day, I couldn't go to class. I went to the library and I collected my books; I went to the living room and collected my books. As I was getting back to my room from the library my mind started wandering. Just thinking about her and her naked body, her wet pussy, even her ass, and then all of those little things.</p> <p>I went over to my bed. I sat in the middle of it and slowly started moving my thoughts. I couldn't leave this feeling; my mind is in such a fog. I didn't want to disturb her. I just wanted to enjoy her body.</p> <p>After I had my first night of sleep I was lying on my back. I didn't want to go to sleep. I put my hand on it and played with it, it felt really nice. I was thinking to myself:</p> <p>"Why is my hand on my nightie? If I don't get my mind off of it she won't be able to come."</p> <p>After a moment of my dream where I was playing with her nipples I was unable to concentrate on anything but her body, and just thought to myself:</p> <p>"Is that it? Is that what is bothering me?"</p> <p>Then I got up to go to the bathroom. I closed the door and took off my clothes. I was thinking again. What did I think? Why did it felt so good to have her body that way? I felt her naked body in my hand, on the bed and on her breasts and on her stomach where she was naked and on her knees, her legs on the bed with legs apart, and I could see how wet she was, how she was wet between her legs. I couldn't bear to look where my dick was. I had a sudden urge to look between her legs, where my dick was and who it might be.</p> <p>I just had to look. I wanted to see it, to see how wet and the wet pussy was, to see how it might feel to have sex with this beautiful pussy. And I wanted to touch it, to feel it.</p> <p>I was so nervous. I was thinking of having sex with her, my dear, I am so sorry. I felt so ashamed. Did she say yes?</p> <p>The thought made me feel weak. My heart was beating a mile a mile a minute. I was thinking. the same thing. I am thinking. I am thinking. I am thinking that I am thinking. I am thinking about to feel this moment in her legs are wet, not the wet. "in.
