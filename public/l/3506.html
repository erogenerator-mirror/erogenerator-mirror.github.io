And just as all the others, I think it is very well known around the world that the villain of all the villains of ours are men who are not good for anything but the most pleasurable sexual pleasure. In his book Shakespeare (and of all the other writers too) says in his words exactly what kinds of people do what we do and what we are. That's just how I feel whenever a particularly wicked or wicked villain shows me his lusty mind.</p> <p>"And we shouldn't be doing this," he said. "I'm not that kind of guy. He's right, isn't he?"</p> <p>"I don't know, really," replied Sylvia from her chair. "I mean, I know that he might be a really good looking guy, but I don't know what kind of a person I am, you know? I'm not sure why the kind of things he thinks about those girls, you know. I know that because I have seen his profile in one of those stories I've read. I know that he's a writer, and he can probably write a story for a whole page and still be the most popular author that the world has ever seen. I just don't know exactly how it's meant that you and the boys should be doing this, either!"</p> <p>"No!" asserted the villain. "We're supposed to do this and not get into trouble. All this talk and you don't even have sex with a girl!"</p> <p>Well! I suppose I should do that for them! What harm could possibly come from letting someone else think that I'm a better-looking, more intellectual, more beautiful than a mere girl? Still, as they say, "just try and think of something you know" and all that, I should just be thinking of something I know better!</p> <p>"Hey, look," he began, "I'm not that kind of guy. I'm sure you don't believe me. But you're right, don't you? I was really surprised to meet you. And don't worry, it works! Besides, you don't really want to mess anything up between us!" And his whole face smiled and his eyes widened a bit at that remark. "What's it going to be, then?" he asked.</p> <p>Well, I thought. Should I tell him already or wait and see what else he has in store? What does he think I am? I hope he'll believe me.</p> <p>"Here's what I would like," decided Sylvia. "I would like you give me an orgasm that way, but not only that! I want you to make me come like some sort of sexual being! I would like you to make me come in every way possible, including a lot of other things, such as having it in my pussy! I want to be able to hold onto your hard cock and just feel it for the ages!"</p> <p>And now that was the kind of thing that would be most effective. I thought about how it felt when you are a woman in a room full of men and their throbbing tools spurting their ejaculations all over your stomach! I thought about the way they ejaculated into your tits! I thought about how nice it would feel to have them fill my mouth! I thought about what it would feel like to have my lips wrapped around each one of those hard cocks, of having them slide inside my eager mouth and back out again! I thought of how it would feel to have my lips pressed around a hard cock or, as I say, some other hard one!</p> <p>To answer his question, I thought about a few other things like that. For example, I thought about what it would feel like to have the hard hot rod inside my pussy with some other dick. I thought about what it would feel like to be a real girl; to lick and suck on a cock that you could see through your skirt! I thought about how to please a hard rod with my lips and tongue while I would also be sucking on a nice pair of cock-sauces.</p> <p>All of his stuff came in a couple of different ways, as I said. For instance, at first we'd try our hand at blowjobs and how I would like to blow him, and then, if that was all right with you, just relax the lips and tongue as much as you can. And I found my mouth also got a lot more than a lot of it; for him that's another story! He loves the way it feels when he's touching his lips or a girl against their breasts that he's just gently sliding around a nice cock. He loves their boobs, too, really! So, too, too. Does a bit more than a bit of a bit of it too, I bet, does—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
