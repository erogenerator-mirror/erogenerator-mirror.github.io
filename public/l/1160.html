He felt hands begin to lift his shirt upward and his thoughts disappeared as his shirt was slowly stripped away. Now lying on the concrete street they seemed to dance, and there was an intensity to their movement that caused both them and each other to want to stay where they were. He slid his shirt off, revealing his torso, and then he felt hands pull his shorts and underwear off, freeing him.</p> <p>His hands flew to explore the man’s body, feeling the muscles and smoothness of his chest and stomach as he gently caressed and fondled his man. He kissed his way up along the man as he knelt before the kneeling man, his face between the man’s legs, feeling the heat of desire spread through him.</p> <p>His hands were trembling. Gavroche felt his own heat building, and he knew he must resist it if he were to remain standing here, letting the whole city watch a man masturbate under his roof as he’d described in the book.</p> <p>Gavroche’s voice came up from outside, “My name is Gavroche, and I’m not here for what you are doing.”</p> <p>The man let out a sound somewhere between a grunt and a gasp, “Yes…yes…I know,” he said through clenched teeth.</p> <p>“I know,” Gavroche replied, giving up the restlessness that he felt in being in the moment.</p> <p>His fingers spread open his labia as he felt his head lift towards the man’s cock, which was fully erect against his skin. His fingers moved over the shaft and he heard the man let out a gasp. Before he could ask a question or stop him, the man took his cock in his mouth, while his hands grabbed his shoulders and pulled him down forcefully. Gavroche felt his knees weaken as his man’s mouth took in his most sensitive spot, making him moan. His fingers ran down the front of his body, caressing the skin just below his nipples. He could take every moment until his orgasm. He needed to come inside this man. He needed to have the attention.</p> <p>Gavroche’s fingers tightened as he heard the moans that escaped his mouth, and he brought his eyes upwards to the man’s eyes. He looked up into his eyes, still taking his mouth for several minutes, until he met the man and broke the connection.</p> <p>“Why…why could I ever want more?” he heard himself say.</p> <p>The man looked down at his man, seeing that there were tears in his eyes. He saw some pain in the man’s, but he didn’t let the tears go. He saw the man’s eyes, the eyes lost in passion. Gavroche felt his heart burst and he could’ve cared less if he hadn’t.</p> <p>“It’s not your fault,” he said, pulling away from the man, “It’s not the fault of the people of this world. This is just...” Gavroche couldn’t finish the sentence because he couldn’t help himself anymore. He wanted to be with this man. He wanted to be with this man again. Gavroche had been through this much before. After all, he’d always loved this man. There was some reason he couldn’t go back now.</p> <p>“Don’t be upset if I just said,” the man said, “I am not here for you, Gavroche. I am simply interested in having a regular lover. My name is Sveta.”</p> <p>Gavroche felt a rush go through him, as both his body and his mind reacted to his words. The words left him, in a torrent that had washed through the men’s bodies. Suddenly, the man pulled his dick from the man’s mouth with a soft “Oooh” and turned toward the man.</p> <p>Gasping for the breath, Gavroche stared at Sveta in shock. He stared as well as he could. He had never expected him to be able to be with a person. He looked at first he wanted to say something, look. He could tell to what he wanted to be desired to know. It was what was not feel like that it like he”—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
