No man can hinder thee to live as thy nature doth require. Nothing</h4><p><strong>can happen unto thee, but what the common good of nature doth require.</strong> She did all she could with her eyes, not really wanting to bother anyone but just to enjoy the feelings that they were evoking in her body.</p> <p>Oh yes, she was going to fuck... she had said a million little naughty ones already. There were certainly a lot of reasons why she didn't like to fuck. First, she enjoyed feeling desired in a man, and even loved to think she was able to do that. But when it came to real-life sex, she'd just got into the habit of trying to get fucked. So there you have it.</p> <p>But there were a couple of real-life problems. First, she was still young. Second, she didn't remember any of this. And third ...</p> <p>She hated when he was the only decent thing that popped into her head ... and she always did anyway.</p> <p>Well, it wasn't just the fact that he had the kind of body that made women melt. His cock was perfect, she could tell and it was just like always. But it was never good to compare any one particular dick to every one else.</p> <p>She knew there was another category of people and not in every position and that's why she was here with a dick that wasn't as good as yours, but she had never gone to all that trouble to try it out and she wasn't going to waste any more time.</p> <p>She liked him already. The fact that he could do whatever he wanted with her made her insides turn that way ... for what she was worth.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Derek</p> <p>He was standing at the entrance to the gym when she walked in. She stopped right before they were about to go in, took his hand, and they kissed. Her eyes still closed, he pressed her against the wall and she wrapped her arms around his neck. They didn't say a word. They just did the things they did. She felt him, smelled him, tasted him. His kisses were passionate on her neck, he licked and nibbled in the hollow of her ear, and she did whatever he told her to do. She never stopped him.</p> <p>His hand started pulling down her sweater, slowly and almost painfully.</p> <p>She sighed a breathless gasp as the first push of his finger inside her bra caught her breath. Her hands came up to kiss him on the mouth, but still she couldn't stop him. He pulled away.</p> <p>But then she saw a grin in his eyes again. She did her best to meet his gaze as he leaned down to kiss her again.</p> <p>"Why, aren't you in your room?" She turned her head so that her smile was back and leaned her face in close to his. "Do you need any help?"</p> <p>"I dunno." The smile in his face changed, but she just nodded, smiled again and said, "I'm just getting used to the idea of you naked all the time."</p> <p>"You're right. Now just go grab a couple of shirts and stuff." He laughed at her enthusiasm. "I'll let you get changed. Just hang out until I get rid of you."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Derek</p> <p>She turned back to him with a half-opened eye and said, "That one's great," before kissing him once again. His hand caressed her arm. Then she let go.</p> <p>"I've only got about 30 seconds to spare before we have to get naked."</p> <p>"You better get undressed," she teased him.</p> <p>He laughed.</p> <p>"You said that for your friend, remember?"</p> <p>She nodded. Her friend was right. She would be naked right now and Derek would be naked. He'd have no problem. She made a silly face at herself before adding, "Come on." She led him past his room to his bed which is right over on the other side, almost directly away. She paused a moment before continuing: "I want you to watch me while I undress."</p> <p>"Oh, are you sure that's what you want?"</p> <p>"I'm not giving you permission to say anything. Don't be embarrassed, but you're naked anyway."</p> <p>"Yes ... yeah just like I told you," he smiled.</p> <p>She put off the last bit of her clothes. She could feel his eyes on her as she stepped up the stairs to the bedroom and turned to look at him. He was admiring her, she was really good looking. Her legs were beautifully toned and her breasts were even bigger than they had been. They were full, perky, and high. Her nipples were hard as diamonds, and her breasts were full and round, full in proportionally proportioned. Her stomach was flat and her breasts seemed to be her most of them and her. Her hips were big and rounded. Her hands moved to the buttons ... her waist that way down her wayâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
