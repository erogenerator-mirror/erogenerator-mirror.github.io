Was I really thinking to give up my principles of church preaching?</p> <p>And as my eyes turned up the light in the church and saw the young couple standing in the aisle looking on, I knew something was terribly wrong. I could tell the person was very much older than me, and it seemed so wrong it might as well be illegal in Christening. And I'm pretty sure that was why I hadn't decided how to respond.</p> <p>I had to think.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>Christina was very young when I had first met Christina McEwan. The girl was beautiful in a most wholesome kind of way—young girl—but she was also the antithesis of Christina Christeson—the girl who had once been Christina. That's the look on Christina's face. When our eyes met, I saw the young devil in her eyes. And when our mouths came together in a way that only teenage boys can do, I felt her kiss me and it was so lovely, and it was so hot and fierce and erotic. For an instant, you would swear that Christina knew I was Christina on some level. Then, the light bulb went on in my brain. After I had made this connection about a half dozen times during my Christening classes, all that information came flooding back. I had already found someone.</p> <p>Christina was the sweetest girl on god's green earth. My first impression on Christina had actually been right—not because she was pretty, not because she had a nice body, not because she had a very nice body—not because she had breasts which weren't terribly big and not terribly saggy—just nice. And she was smart as a whip of the belt, and she was very smart. She could use her smart mouth to keep herself from getting hurt by bullying in the classroom, but she couldn't be so nice at all for a virgin. That was Christina.</p> <p>The sex together was something Christina had told me I should never experience with anyone else. Hell, I knew I shouldn't have gotten involved with Christina. But it was hard on everyone that I knew. I wasn't an intellectual—I wasn't interested, but I was a horny, young, horny guy who was horny, so that I really didn't matter in the end of life, not to me. Or more accurately, the moment I realized that I was horny. Well, that was okay with me because I was, and I liked horny guys—a lot. They could satisfy all the urges that women could go for, but even if they could't satisfy any of them, it was a good enough reason to have sexy guys around. And some other hot guys, too.</p> <p>So I did this by looking at each of the young guys in awe because neither of them had ever taken interest in my sexual interests in the way that I had. It was just the way I was, and my sexuality was in the forefront of life at the moment—the head of my penis jutted toward the ceiling and I tried to think of myself as one hot guy and not trying to fit in a hole in some girl's panties or something. Oh, hell, it seemed ridiculous that I could attract the young studs in the way that they wanted—that their sexual interest and energy was in that direction, but what can I say? I might have attracted a few girls—if I hadn't already. Some of them were so cute and cute and sweet, but some of them weren't. They were just boys that knew what they wanted.</p> <p>I didn't care for what those guys thought of me as. I just wanted to have fun with them, with my cock if I had it, and with Christina so much like me. And I wanted to be with her, too, that way. But I can't say that to the other way round.</p> <p>After my initial attraction was confirmed, by looking at Christina McEwan again, I was ready to be with her. After I came home and found out that Christina was still in the service, that she really did have a boyfriend, and then we became friends, we became boyfriend and girlfriend, if Christina wanted me to have sex with her once in a while, and she wouldn't do that—and she wouldn't do it either. I wasn't going to do that, either—the other way round.</p> <p>There was no sex part of this experience—there wasn't a sex thing in all that, but there was an underlying sexual component. Christina had a boyfriend. It wasn't a sexual thing, mind, for her. We were friends now lovers, and lovers. Or so would not even if and when they were in love to fuck in one another other the other's heart. They were to fuck another.
