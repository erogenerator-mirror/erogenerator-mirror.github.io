If it were thine act and in thine own power, wouldest thou do</h4><p><strong>it? If it were not, whom dost tin accuse? the atoms, or the Gods? For to do either, the part of a mad man. Thou must therefore blame nobody, but</strong> all, for this foolishness.</p> <p>The room was a large, white room dominated by a four-poster bed. Two chairs were arranged against a small round table, filled with a red-and-orange-sized cloth-wrapped table cloth.</p> <p>The other chair was occupied by a very nervous looking and naked male woman! She was kneeling and she had her mouth on the man's cock, sucking what she was not swallowing. She wasn't gagging as she was deep throating the poor little thing, but she certainly was not sucking on his cock as he was deep throating a beautiful woman. She sucked on the tip, then pulled back, letting saliva or precum ooze, before continuing along the other side.</p> <p>As he was watching the woman, the man was busy fucking the woman, watching her mouth and throat move up and down on a large cock. She was looking directly at him, making a show of it, and she was making her hand work faster. The man was taking his time now, making her wait. She wasn't moving her mouth from his cock; she was making slow, sensuous sounds of ecstasy. He was starting to moan like a bull, his hand still clutching at her hair, guiding her face, trying to urge her deeper. The woman was starting to get a mouthful of saliva now, and the man's cock was going to be in her throat in a moment.</p> <p>At the mention of the word throat, the man's cock jumped, making a sucking noise. The woman on his cock wanted to moan, to pull away, to cry. But she wanted him to make the cock sound like an animal, while she was being fucked. The man gave him a nod and the woman started humming her sex song, and the sounds stopped again.</p> <p>The woman was on her back, with her legs spread open on her stomach. Even her hips were raised, as if offering her sex to this man. As she kept moaning and squealing in pleasure, her pussy became open, exposing soft skin. There was enough moisture running down her cheeks to soak her anus, but there was moisture running also on her legs. She was rubbing her pussy in circles on her fingers, trying to get herself aroused.</p> <p>"I'm coming! Please!" she yelled, as the man in front of her brought her up from his cock and pushed her onto her back. As she lay there on the bed, her arms and legs opened, the man got on her. He was at the head of the bed now, getting over her breasts. Her thighs were in the air, spread wide.</p> <p>She didn't know if she was having sex with this man or not. Who was it? she started to ask. The man on her chest smiled at her, "It's you, baby. You are the woman I've been dying to fuck!" he exclaimed, as his cock slipped into her. She was moaning, as the man started fucking her with quick, hard strokes. She started to cry out as his cock drove into her, pushing her to a different world, but she was enjoying the physical sensation of his hardness. He was starting to fuck her faster, so he had to push on her hips to meet him. Her back was arched, as his hands were in her open hair, guiding her head. He pumped her so fast that she felt a sharp stab in the back of her cunt. His cock was driving into her as hard as she was pumping it, her breasts and mouth still sucking and squeezing her own sex organs. She was in a dream state on her back, her pussy on fire, ready to receive this man that she hadn't had for over a decade. She was in a dreamworld, in this strange world that made her feel that she was on the prowl for something even better.</p> <p>At the same time, he was making her feel sexy, and wild. He was looking at her from over her shoulder: she was like a woman he'd seen on film of his age. She was taking on an identity that she had not even been aware of, or was trying to. She was taking on a man who had been an engineer at the Pentagon, and was very rich.</p> <p>With the man's cock still thrusting into her, she was starting to feel an orgasm coming on.</p> <p>She thought to herself, "So I know how these things happen in engineering - what I have to do to get a job..." she murmured to herself.</p> <p>The man started pounding her faster, and she started moaning like an enraged animal in heat. The sweat rolled onto her chest, and the noise of flesh on flesh was making her pussy spasm. She had never felt anything like this before. She wondered what it would feel like to have a man, to have his cock inside her, in her, how it... she couldn't know for one man to own him. As this man.
