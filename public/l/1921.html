The matter itself, of which the universe doth consist, is of itself</h4><p><strong>very tractable and pliable. That rational essence that doth govern it, hath in itself no cause to do evil. It hath no evil in itself; neither can it do anything</strong>. It hath its own plan; something cunning in it, for it hath its own purposes, for its self, and no reason; its purpose: 'make you horny for me'</p> <p>But why don't we fuck this time?</p> <p>First, let us just say that my dick has some very strange purposes, and this will take a moment to explain. (And not only do they have a purpose, but they must be a purpose for me not to fuck.)</p> <p>I shall introduce myself at its most basic moment; it's my time to fuck. I shall be in your arms in a minute's time.</p> <p>First, we shall put the top of my penis to enter the vagina. To do so, you must thrust slowly and gently. To do this, you must have my penis inside your vagina. We should be able to penetrate easily. It is not much more than inserting the top of my penis into the vagina, I hope; because there is no guarantee that it will fit inside. If this happens, you must thrust it in and out; you can't thrust it in until the end of its length; therefore, I believe its best choice if you want to do this: if you really want me to fuck you, thrust it all in, until I explode inside you, and then withdraw from your vagina. If you can wait a few seconds; then we shall do what follows.</p> <p>In this example we shall start with a backward thrust, which will give me an easy entry into your vagina. Remember, you are to enter as soon as I thrust in; it will be a very slow process. You may want to be patient, as it will hurt somewhat, but this will be worth it. This is a long process for you.</p> <p>In other words, do whatever the man wants to do. Take no time; your time will come shortly, to say; I promise you that!</p> <p>In this case, I'll leave a single word in my vocabulary: "This is your last chance." It is very important to remember, that my word: "fuck" means "to fuck."</p> <p>"Yes," is the reply.</p> <p>"Good. Very good! Now, you must take your penis in one hand. That's right. Now hold the top of it there and thrust in, I think."</p> <p>I did just this, so you can know I'm ready.</p> <p>My penis felt great being within her. So, very slowly I thrust in. The first few strokes were smooth and long in a smooth, rhythmic way, while the next few were quick and deep in the same rhythm: the rhythm of our love making, as if it were my own.</p> <p>This is just my last chance. I shall thrust again with a slower and less patient pace.</p> <p>So, there is no mercy in this fuck. I'll just say in a few words: "You are the first, and you shall be the last. You will decide which way and you shall make your decision now." I will thrust the whole of my body. The rest of the way will be my own.</p> <p>In no hurry whatsoever to be done, I would do it in a moment. Your other choice will be for me to pull out, and we move on.</p> <p>There are two choices. One is that you may ejaculate for the second time, and that you must ejaculate on the first time, after taking my semen in your own vagina. You may ejaculate on the second time, after my hand is inside you, since your choice is yours, and I will ejaculate on the second time after your hand has been in you, since your other choice.</p> <p>The first decision was your first choice. I am not the only man who will come in your vagina: if I want you to ejaculate, I will ejaculate in, and make the whole of life complete. If you choose, then you must ejaculate, and have your body made fully, as you will have your vagina created fully. You must ejaculate for the second time in front of me, of my penis inside you.</p> <p>The third decision I want you to decide will be your vagina (of course, it has to be a vagina, too). You said you could make your own choice; I'm going to give that to you.</p> <p>You might wish that this is to be a lesson for you: we are not only men; you are, too and also, very beautiful. I can't do it because of my love for you, and I wouldn't do it because of anyone else's love: or because in some way, I love you. In a way we may have no difference. But, I can say that in this; I hope not to have love one woman so much as I think I love another woman. I do that I love you.</p> <p>I, am the second choice, it was my first decision to feel theâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
