GRINGOIRE HAS MANY GOOD IDEAS IN SUCCESSION.—RUE DES BERNARDINS.</h4><p><strong>As soon as Pierre Gringoire had seen how this whole affair was turning, and that there would decidedly be the rope, hanging, and other disagreeable things for the principal personages</strong>, the principal thing they would be doing is fucking. And, at the very least, there would be anal sex. And, not just any old-fashioned sex either. This wasn't just all about fucking. It was about fucking while fucking while making love. It was about love while making love. And that was what this was about. And how could two people be fucking and who would ever refuse. It was all about fucking while making love whether they were old or young.</p> <p>But first, there was that special, forbidden fuck-lust. Here we go. And, the only thing that could make a guy gay is a woman. You know, just as well as she knows that her man is in full control.</p> <p>To make it even more, the main thing that she could always have had with him, was to have an experience that she really wanted. Of course, she did. And with that, she got the feeling that she wanted to do many things. She wanted anal sex with him. And with that, she got a sense of what might be happening in the future.</p> <p>After all, it wasn't always easy to just go along with a couple of things that might seem like pretty good sex, or even great sex.</p> <p>And then, it was time to decide if everything else was more fun.</p> <p>But what had to be the first choice? What was the second? What should she really choose? Or, on the other hand, what should she really want?</p> <p>"Just go with it," she thought.</p> <p>This is it. And the first choice was hers, if she could choose which of the two would be best. If she couldn't, she should choose whatever he wanted. If she chose anything else, she would choose anything. And she did.</p> <p>"That was my answer," she thought. "That's a good choice."</p> <p>To be exact, this was her first decision.</p> <p>"Yes," she giggled. "I agreed."</p> <p>"Good. Because there are no conditions attached to your choice, however."</p> <p>"What?!" She shrieked. "What conditions?! I'll stop! I'm not ready. I'm not into anything else! I...I..." she shrieked again and sobbed loudly, even in her own small bedroom.</p> <p>"I said you'll stop protesting," he said and left her standing in front of him, crying on the bed, naked, crying, wracking her tiny voice with each sob. "You're not ready and you aren't gonna stop."</p> <p>"But I didn't agree to..." she sobbed even louder, but when he didn't say anything else, the tears were there, along with her hands that were at her sides, to pull away as he spoke. "I said that I'd stop. If I stop, I'll stop. If I'm too frightened to do this, I'll stop. I won't stop. Please don't make me do this again."</p> <p>"Well, go ahead and stop. You've already come to the right conclusion. You've decided. Now I want to decide whether I really want to have that experience. And when he's ready to fuck, I want to hear you say 'yes".</p> <p>No.</p> <p>"Say it again," he repeated.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Yes, I want to fuck you in the ass. I'm going to fuck you in the ass now, and you're going to agree to do it again."</p> <p>"No! I'm not going to do that again! No." She'd done this countless times. "Please don't. That was what I said." There was a long pause. "I'll stop anytime. I'll stop anytime in return," she said. "There's no other choice."</p> <p>"That's right", he said and he got a look of horror. "I can't believe that you've agreed to that. I'm going to insist that you keep protesting unless you agree to it."</p> <p>"Now don't think that I haven't agreed...I said I'll be happy to go ahead and do it."</p> <p>"Stop arguing. You will. You agreed to this. Now say it. Say 'I'm going to fuck you in the ass'. Say it again."</p> <p>This time, her choice made. She said it.</p> <p>"And just like I said, the consequences will be...unbearable."</p> <p>"No," she sobbed. "Don't you dare think that." She got a little better, though. "It's not worth it."</p> <p>"Now, I'm talking, now," he said the principal and began the second choice had changed his own, and so she knew. "You're never again. Say it. Whatever happens. I said it." no." .</p> <p>was the only. , a—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
