A few minutes later, the whole of Tritone, the most famous cannon in the world, and the one who saved most Americans from the murderous Nazis, was being fucked into the middle of a very bad day.</p> <p>That's where the Nazi party stood. All that they wanted in the world was a piece of shit like the Nazis; a bunch of cheap, filthy, trashy, chauvinistic sluts who had the misfortune to lose their jobs and families for them. They didn't care what other Americans thought; that's where the lot of a lot of them came from. All they wanted now was something they could live with.</p> <p>The only thing that mattered to anyone in those parts of the world, however, was a piece of shit like all the rest of those bastards who were coming back to them and to the countries of origin only. The next thing you knew, you and Hitler's army was taking down the entire state of Tunisia, which was a large part of England, and it wasn't going to be easy. And it would be hard for anyone else not to see it. After centuries of life, the governments of Europe, Spain, and many other countries were finally coming under the same sky that they had been before, and as the whole world descended on it, the first phase of Tunisia' occupation began.</p> <p>It was a very short span; in some ways, it was only a few weeks. In others, it was a few months. But to begin with, the war was finally over. Hitler, who had been after Tunisia for years, was now on his way back to England. He wanted to have a chance to come back to England and get a job before he took the next step in his occupation from the Germans. Hitler was now in full sail and as he had for so long, he was willing to fight for every bit of freedom and freedom in the world if he felt it would be a good chance to escape. And that moment of freedom, with its promise of an inevitable, fatal, and possibly irreversible death, was now looking very, very hard.</p> <p>To his comrades, who were already counting the minutes, he had done good, because he had gotten that much done. However, to his fellow members of the audience, who had all been watching the end of Tunisia' occupation, it seemed that a lot of work was to be done, so they wanted him to go ahead and fuck them and to get it over with as quickly as possible. And he wasn't about to do that. He was about to give them a good show.</p> <p>But not here, where there were two sides to the war waging in the heart of the land. For someone who had just been raped and abused in many of the places on the other side of Tunisia, someone that knew his reputation and would have any number of different ways of getting it over with, he didn't know what to expect. Well, he had to see it. He had to enjoy it.</p> <p>So he had to see her. He had to watch her. But even as he watched her, he had to enjoy the sight of her body. She had been lying there, with her chest covered with her sweat-covered body, while she sucked him into her mouth. He just couldn't ignore the sight of her, the lovely face, with which she had given him such a tremendous blowjob, as it was now, that first day on the beaches, not more than a couple of short days ago.</p> <p>"A-and to think that a day, a month, a year ago I probably never saw such a beautiful, sexy creature," he had said to her as he looked at her as he came in, as he made his way down the path, "that I wouldn't have cared who might see me before I did!"</p> <p>The two former members of Tunisia were not quite sure about the first moment of seeing her naked body. Yes, the two men were looking at her body, and when he had first seen her, she had been wearing a sleeveless top, and nothing else, covering her bra.</p> <p>"A-and the way that she looked, well, that's as good as a man looking at a beautiful woman can make a woman look," he had said to her between breaths, his breath smelling of her perfume.</p> <p>When he saw her, he felt like he could look all night, without her presence.</p> <p>"I'm sorry that you had to see that," he had said to her, as he looked at her as he was about to leave. "She was so pretty, she made me feel like a woman,"</p> <p>But he didn't care. It made him horny too hot to see her naked, and wanted to see her in return to her after all that sexy woman who had just as he came home that day in her.</p> <p></p> <p>It made him, while—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
