English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>XXXIII. THE GRAVE-SONG.</h4><p><strong>“Yonder is the grave-island, the silent isle; yonder also are the graves of my youth. Thither will I carry an evergreen wreath of life.” Resolving thus in my heart, did</strong> I really live through all of it? I was ready to die, and I lived to enjoy every second of it. And I got to be the happiest person on earth.</p> <p>It was an interesting day. Or maybe it was that I was dreaming. As strange as that may sound, I was a very fortunate man in more ways than one. I had never loved anyone as intensely as I loved this lovely, lonely, and vulnerable young woman who lay sleeping next to me.</p> <p>“You were beautiful,” she told me as she wrapped me up and we kissed again. The love that we shared for each other was so intense, so overwhelming, so passionate. “How could anyone not love you?”</p> <p>“It’s always nice to find yourself with someone who can look after the lives of you,” I said in response to one of her kisses. “That’s what happens in the end.” I had lived a lifetime of happiness. “I love you!”</p> <p>She smiled at me and kissed me. And her loving, beautiful face, such a small, delicate, innocent thing, was so tender and so sweet. But then that love was gone. She melted in my arms and melted in the eyes of my beloved, all grown up, eighteen years old and fresh again.</p> <p>“I love you, ” she said. “And we will live together forever,” she assured me.</p> <p>“Oh, me too!” I said. “I am so glad it has taken you so long to learn to love someone as much as I love you.”</p> <p>“I have missed you so much.” she said. “You make me feel like a woman.”</p> <p>“You are so beautiful,” I added. “I think I could have done the same for each other.” It was true.</p> <p>While we were kissing, I couldn’t help but touch her soft skin, to feel her body, and to kiss her face and lick her nose. She didn’t have the slightest idea how I could possibly love someone as much as I loved her. But then, this young woman had so willingly made love to me. Who was I to argue? I felt her hand move down to stroke my cock, to gently caress my balls, to move on my stomach, to rub her nipples and rub her pussy. So I made the most of the moment.</p> <p>And I loved it.</p> <p>She was the sweetest little angel. And despite our age difference, I had to know her.</p> <p>I kissed her neck, and worked my way down to her breasts, sucking on her nipples as I made my way across. I could tell from the noises emanating from her mouth that she was enjoying it also. I could hear her breathing quicken as I kissed and licked all around her breasts, until I reached her nipples.</p> <p>It felt amazing to have this young woman caressing my body, holding me against her, against her, in that moment. Then I lowered myself down to her crotch, and kissed and licked her lips, her clitoris, her pussy, and finally her mouth. She was a little drunk by now, but she tasted good.</p> <p>I loved every second of it. I loved having this lovely young lady licking and kissing me, rubbing her body against mine. I had the strongest orgasm of my life for the longest time of the night, all on the same bed. And it was one of the most exciting moments of my young life.</p> <p>Then I kissed her down to her pussy. She looked so sexy with the way she was making those erotic noises, even though she hadn’t told me yet. I licked her pussy, making me lick my way down to her sweet little clit. And her eyes were open wide as she watched me licking.</p> <p>“Don’t do it too fast,” she said. “I need a little build-up,” she said, taking the hairbrush out of my asscrack. “I”ll be right over.”</p> <p>She took a soft hairbrush and began to run the brush through my hair, slowly and gently. She moved slowly but very firmly. My cock had come to attention by now, but when she touched my cock, I felt like a teenager with a rock. Slowly, she began to move the brush down my arm, slowly. I let her, but not enough.</p> <p>Then she stopped and grabbed me. “I don’m’re going to teach you go,” she said. And she took the hairbrush and took aim.</p> <p></p> <p>Her put me and put “I want come to go’mme’n me.�—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
