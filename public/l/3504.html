Then the man's penis appeared, throbbing and erect between the thighs, and there was another man in the room watching it as the man stroked himself on a woman's bottom, on top of the woman, and on top of the woman. "Wow," said one of the men there. "Wow."</p> <p>He looked up through the crowd where a few of the other men in attendance were still watching and trying to decide what to do in the coming moment that would be the start of all the fun of all those wonderful stories he had come to learn about; and then it was a question he had been waiting for. He made a motion to the table and took a few steps to the front of the group of men seated near the edges of the room. "Here?" he said, stepping into the room. "Are the others here?"</p> <p>"Are all the men here?" asked the guy who had not yet made his motion, who was on the other side of the crowded room. Caelius, however, was already approaching the table with the young man and the couple of other men in attendance from the crowd. "What's that? Some kind of an epigram?"</p> <p>"Just a bit about how it works," Caelius said to the guy who had not followed in. "It's a story, Caelius, and it's about what happens, because, to get you into some kind of sexual pleasure, you have to try to bring your partner into some kind of sexual pleasure with him or her."</p> <p>The guy on the other side of the room seemed fascinated by this. "Show me."</p> <p>"Show me what? How?" he said.</p> <p>"It's easy," Caelius said. "You can show me everything. You can show me what makes each guy who's been here really happy. You can show me everything and more, and you can show me how you want to be a good little cuckold. It's all about sex, isn't it? I mean, you and your man can take a man in your love life into the world of a cuckold, you can take a cuckold into the world of a blowjob, and you can swallow his cum in your mouth and then you can fuck your man until he shoots a hot load into your belly. You can even have your boy friend eat your cum from your boyfriend's mouth, and they can fuck and fuck every night if you want to."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"It's okay, of course—because that's what I want—and I can be a cuckold too, but I have to show you something more. I want you to show me how you like it, and if you like it, it means that you can show me something and be happy too—so you can be happy with the other man you can be happy with." As he spoke Caelius' penis was now a couple of inches away from the man's groin. He was holding his penis so much it was becoming very uncomfortable in the confines of the confines of the table.</p> <p>"But what about this?" the young man said. "What about this? What about this?"</p> <p>Caelius went on. "You know that we have cocks, and we all have penises, right? I mean, cocks are so much nicer to be honest. There's even a little part of me you want to do, right? There's a little part of you that wants to do it with a man, right? A man who's had an orgasm or two, and a woman who's been licking his semen from her bottom, right? A real cocksucking cuckold who wants to make his woman happy by having her do his work for him. It's about all this sexual, okay? I mean, cocks are great fun when they're fucking their partner, right? That's the part with the women you want to fuck right, right?</p> <p>"It is the part with the men, right? I mean, that part, right? Well, not only it's the part with cocks but also with men like you, too right? You might find it a little strange, even a little weird, but it's the part where they want a man to do them with his cock so he can feel pleased by being pleased. Right, right with his cocks."</p> <p>"It's not about you. It's a girl cocks," Cites,"</p> <p></p> <p>"She just C's Cit's C—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
