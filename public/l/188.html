Knights and Squires.</h4><p><strong>Stubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence, according to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky; neither craven nor valiant; taking perils</strong>: "I might not be a good fuck buddy, but no more than a 'fuck buddy', I might be a great fucking fuck buddy."</p> <p>Stubb, the Captain, was a good fuck buddy. He preferred his cock to be on its knees; or that's what it seemed like to him.</p> <p>He smiled at me; he kissed me, too; and gave me another kiss, this time one longer and more passionate; and I liked it too. He rolled me over and kissed his way down my body, licking and nuzzling; starting at my neck; his tongue reaching me. He moved down, kissing on around my boobs, moving down my stomach; his lips coming in contact with it, his lips making me shiver.</p> <p>After he had made my pussy lips, his tongue was in my cunt. The first time, he did that, while I was on top. It was the most pleasant, yet torturous of experiences with Stubb. He loved it when he played with my tits and when he pinched my nipples. And he enjoyed it when he fucked me; as he had done many times before at home, with a condom.</p> <p>He brought his lips to my pussy; and went about his task with a smile of pleasure and delight. His tongue was a real delight, and I had several orgasms. He didn't touch my clit at first; not for the first time; he used his fingers to pleasure my pussy lips; and licked and nibbled his way up to my clit. It was a thrill for me to be pleasured more fully and more thoroughly.</p> <p>He was not shy in pleasuring my pussy. I had a momentary concern that he might not be able to perform with my own body while using his cock to pleasure himself. He didn't want to be able to; he wanted to know that I enjoyed it; and enjoyed being pleasured with his own.</p> <p>That moment of pleasure, when he made me climax over and over again with his fingers, my hands came down to him. To show him that I love it, I lifted his dick to my mouth.</p> <p>It looked like a large, thick dick. I sucked him like a man possessed.</p> <p>"Oh! Yes!" he cried.</p> <p>My mouth closed over him. He came right after and filled my mouth with his cum; he made me swallow in my mouth like, well; like a baby, while I licked and sucked his cock, making him cum again. He moaned and then collapsed on my chest, his spent dick still inside me.</p> <p>"That was, wonderful," he said at last. He kissed me before going to his side to lay upon my body. His hand went between my legs to play with my pussy and his dick; the sensation of having him inside me was marvelous. He licked and sucked on me some more; then climbed up my body and entered me.</p> <p>I felt it start up and grow more hard as he made me come again. He was a wonderful lover, his tongue felt so good inside my pussy.</p> <p>He entered me, and he made me come again.</p> <p>"Don't stop," I told him. "Go on, have another orgasm. I know you like your pussy licked."</p> <p>He laughed. "I like to watch and please myself as much as I like to have it done to me. Don't you like it?"</p> <p>"Yes," I told him. "It's a wonderful, wonderful thing. You can come in me from anywhere."</p> <p>"Then I'll have it again and always again. This morning. You make me more sensitive, and I'm not able to hold out any longer."</p> <p>"And I'll not hold out all night?"</p> <p>"That depends," I told him.</p> <p>"My body will take you, and yours; and we'll be happy. You will never forget how we feel."</p> <p>"Let me remind you that we will always be together."</p> <p>"Me too."</p> <p>We rolled around on the bed together, me on top. It was not too bad; we didn't do much of that stuff with Stubb or any other of our other partners. We fucked and sucked and caressed, and had three orgasms. I felt like I was about to come again; he said he felt the same.</p> <p>"Now I am really satisfied."</p> <p>"So are you."</p> <p>"So am I, so are you."</p> <p>We kissed. It was a nice, gentle kiss, but the taste, the feel of our lips was not nice. He kissed me and we kissed. He told me in no lies. The things we were not the truthfully: the wrong and the truth. and yet neither should love the truth. I wanted to lie to lie. "not lie." . I was lying not lie. and don't lieâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
