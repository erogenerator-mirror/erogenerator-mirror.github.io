How know we whether Socrates were so eminent indeed, and of so</h4><p><strong>extraordinary a disposition? For that he died more gloriously, that he disputed with the Sophists more subtilty; that he watched in the frost more assiduously; that being commanded to fetch</strong> the price of the moon made him fuck harder than he would on any other, more or less, and that all the fucking is the moment of ecstasy.</p> <p>But he didn't go there. He lay on his back on the bed; his back was propped up on his elbows and his body pushed down on the bed as if it had been in its own place, his legs stretched up in the air and apart. For once, there were no sounds of sexual need in the room. There were only his breathing and his skin.</p> <p>Then this: the moment he woke, it was more like the time of day, where he was lying in bed. There were no words; no movement. No sound of any kind. And he didn't even want to do it. He felt warm, and the light and shadow of his body against the sheets; the feel of his body rubbing, sliding, the feel of his cock as he touched himself. And all this time, a small part of him had been in the way he had felt when he came home to his new home.</p> <p>When he felt like it, when he was alone and free to see and touch, he had wanted to be with her. He wanted—he craved, wanted to be with her, but, no, that wasn't how it happened. He wanted to make love, and, if there was so much to love, to make love to her. He wanted to come in her body when she was there; he wanted to come in her mouth before she got herself there so she could come and come. And now, what had she done? But what if it was all wrong and—no, no, no, that was all wrong and that she was fucking him and that didn't matter. What if it didn't go in her right? She had said she didn't want to and then she was giving in, and it wasn't so. Now, where had the real her come from?</p> <p>It was too late. The cock inside her had hardened to iron like a hard piece of steel but this was no one being; it was an entity, a spirit, a being made of flesh—it had no meaning but it made no difference. It was his own cock that had touched her and made her writhe, it touched and made her writhe and make her come—and that was all, no matter how different. There was no connection in it; only a sort of shared memory of sensation, as if a lover's body and mind were one; of love and lust and pain and pleasure!</p> <p>It had all been a mistake and no man could have been more wrong. She had let his cock inside and told him to let her cunt fill with his cum; she had made it with love and wanted to carry on. He had let her come with his cock but when she had gone back to her bed he had found himself naked and alone: his cock still hard and in the way, not as hard as earlier but still solid in the way he had been in the bed he had been in when he'd fucked her, her cunt and her mouth. He'd been naked and alone with a cock as big as his own—now it was as hard as his; it was as hard as the cock he had just fucked her with; when it was hard as the cock he'd fucked her with and now it wasn't just as hard as the hard cock that had just fucked her or was it different?</p> <p>There was to be no future this moment. The time had come for a long, long time, the time had been so long and it was there to end with a decision, to end with one love all together. But not today; not today. And if one thought that came from a choice was too important and the other way round and she was gone—that is what this was now, not fucking.</p> <p>She wanted to give him pleasure. She had given him pleasure and now she wanted it again. She wanted to be in the mood to give and to give and to give it, so that he would have to be there. She wanted to suck on him and to make him come in her mouth and make him feel as if she had. Yes, she wanted to taste his cum again and to let him taste of her mouth and her cunt and the sperm she was going to give him. She wanted to give him pleasure—and she wanted to do it. She wanted to do it with a cock.</p> <p>But still, it was too late. She wanted to be taken, she wanted to be made.</p> <p>She wanted to be fucked and she wanted a cock inside her and just as she had been told to do, she wanted to be fucked, and to do it she wanted to be made and so it she could. She wanted to be fucked. Herself. Herself could and no one and made and, her self made for she wanted to be made made herself, for—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
