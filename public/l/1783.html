DEAF.</h4><p><strong>On the following morning, she perceived on awaking, that she had been asleep. This singular thing astonished her. She had been so long unaccustomed to sleep! A joyous ray of</strong> sunshine came to her face. Her heart pounded so loudly and joyously her mind began to wonder. Hadn't she been dreaming before? How big was her cock now she mused as her thoughts began to flash before her imagination! How big is it now she thought to herself. She wondered how big a cock can be as she stared up at it as he walked to her bed and kissed her. She wished he would stick it inside her now! She wanted to cum on her fingers, on his hand, and on her body, as her pussy juices ran from every drop she had created in her.</p> <p>"Do you like that?" she asked, her voice throaty with lust.</p> <p>"Oh yes," he whispered. He stood over her, his naked body hovering over her petite form. She raised her hands up to touch herself, as he leaned on his knees and knelt behind her, his cock bobbing between their legs. His face drew close as a warm breath hit her. His touch on her skin made her quiver, as her hands ran down to rest on his shoulders for balance while the weight of him kept her torso up by his chest. The light brush of his fingertips on her skin made her pussy tingle, as her heart began to race. He kissed her neck, her shoulders, her armpits, and then her perky breasts. He licked her nipples while they hung like little erasers between his dark brown lips, drawing a deep moan from her lips.</p> <p>She felt his cockhead nestling inside her. She lifted her body up to him, as a warm sensation ran along her insides. His cock slid along her vagina lips, as if they were lubricating her juices. She arched her back and held her hands up in front of her chest. He reached his arms under her to hold her breasts, the weight of them causing the nipples to stand out even more. He kneaded her breast and pulled on her nipples.</p> <p>She felt the soft touch of his body as his hands ran down her back, to her ass. He squeezed her cheeks slightly, as he drew her butt higher. She loved feeling a man hold her cheeks apart, as he drew her pussy even closer to his body. His cock slid into her in one long, stroke, filling her with his thickness. She felt as if they were a well oiled machine, pumping both holes with such eagerness she could feel it churning within her. His hips began to piston in and out. She could feel him fill her completely in this fashion, yet she didn't ever want it to stop.</p> <p>She felt so full and alive. The pleasure of having him inside of her, and being fully enveloped by him made her want more and more. It was such a delicious feeling he was experiencing and she could feel her excitement mounting. "I want to feel you cum inside me." She gasped out.</p> <p>He continued to pound into her while her hips rolled with every thrust. He leaned on her stomach to maintain his balance and lifted her breasts into his hands. Their eyes met as they gazed at each other. He took one nipple into his mouth and teased it, while the other hand ran along her body. Her hands moved down to cup her pussy as his fingers explored the folds of her cunt. She felt his fingers entering her, as his fingers circled her clit.</p> <p>She felt his penis inside her, as the skin of it swelled against her pubic bone. His body began to thrust against her again, moving in one long, long stroke, and then reversing. Faster and faster and deeper he plunged his cock into her. Their bodies, as one, slapped down against each other as he withdrew from her to plunge himself back into her as he approached climax.</p> <p>The rhythm of their bodies became even faster and faster as they fucked and she wrapped her legs around him. Sweat was running down his face. Sweat from his chest, as two big hot bodies pumped against each other.</p> <p>His body tensed up and she heard him moan as he felt his own orgasm coming. It was like a tidal wave, as his whole body became rigid as his cock erupted inside her. Thick cum blasted her womb! Cum! She felt his cum shoot out of his cock into her.</p> <p>"Oh yes," she cried aloud. "I love you, I love you, I love you!"</p> <p>They collapsed into each other. Their bodies, still slick with sweat and cum, both of them still breathing hard. His sperm began to leak out of her, down to her asshole. His penis slowly sank as his balls slowly emptied.</p> <p>The weight of him dropped onto her stomach, as the last of their strength left him in the world. They lay there, feeling like one. She felt his chest resting on her, his face. She felt his soft breasts against her, as her body against her chest.
