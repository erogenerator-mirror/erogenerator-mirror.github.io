Prince Andrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it had had in</strong> ages past. After everything, he had been dreaming like a child. Now, he had been a boy. Now, he was a man.</p> <p>‘It’s hard for me to get you out of my mind,' Andrew said to himself, thinking over the past four years since he had become a boy. He had dated many younger girls and was still a virgin. At least, that is, until he had gotten his dick through the door. Only, she had been all the sexual encounters a man could hope for. And she was always as horny as ever. And even though she had been everything some of the guys had ever desired, they had been a mess. He wasn’t even sure what they did for sex, if anything, but he knew it shouldn’t be difficult to satisfy her if she wanted all of it.</p> <p>Allowing himself to slip from the bed, he pulled on his briefs and tucked his cock away before making his way to the bathroom. If she caught him in the act, wouldn’t she kill him? He hoped he would die with pleasure. He had never imagined what it would be like to have a woman to suck him off, especially with an audience right there. Oh, my God, she was going to see him. He couldn’t believe it. She was going to see him, whether she wanted to or not.</p> <p>‘That’s not funny!’ he thought, but then again, he knew it was. He saw so many of her and she so many of his friends in the mirror.</p> <p>The bathroom was empty. He heard a toilet flush and then he turned the shower on. Turning the shower handle to its lowest setting to adjust the temperature, he stepped in the bathroom, his penis fully erect. Andrew had a long dick. His six-inch cock fit quite well in his hand, but not especially well in his tight jeans, so he had not worn a rubber. His boyfriend Andrew had always been a bit of a prude about sex, but that night of passion was the first time he had ever gone for more than one man at a time. So, he was willing to risk a few extra men for the sake of it.</p> <p>Taking his cock in his hand and leaning it against the wall of the shower, he enjoyed the warm water running over his body. He cupped his balls in one hand, squeezing them gently and rubbing the skin of his shaft with his thumb. He imagined how sexy his cock must look to her. It was so big and stiff and hot in his hand. Oh, what he didn’t know was that he didn’t have a condom. In fact, he didn’t even know that he had had the desire to have sex with a woman once before before.</p> <p>Maybe it was that he had fantasized about hooking up with a woman before, or that he wasn’t exactly the guy that she wanted to be with. He didn’t think she would mind if he did some of those things. Probably, nothing they had not done before. If anything, that would be a good sign for her to finally have a cock in her mouth because if anything, she would be all the more talented a cocksucker as he was. Andrew reached up to caress the end of his cock with his fingers while he ran his other hand over his face. So, he continued to run his hand up and down over his shaft, relishing the feeling of a warm shower. He let his cock throb and throb in his hand while he ran his hand over the top of his balls. He wondered if the softness of his skin or if he could stroke himself to a climax. Maybe, he would have to let her suck him off and blow him.</p> <p>His body was reacting so strongly to the shower, the pulsing of the water. If she did suck him off, it would be the most pleasurable thing he did. Maybe she would let him lick her pussy after she was done. And maybe, he would have to let her do that too.</p> <p>He had never imagined it before, but he enjoyed thinking about such things. He had fantasized about the times he had sucked a woman and enjoyed licking her pussy after her lover’s man was done. Of course, he had only been with several women before, and not many others. Perhaps, it was the woman who had so sexually excited him before, but perhaps it wasn’t. Maybe it was the time he spent with his girlfriend, the time he had masturbated to the sex with her, and her. Maybe, maybe she had not only had been a blowjob, in order to him and she had to him. And in her.</p> <p></p> <p>Andrew imagined another thought came with an incestuous thought of all that he looked like a man was a woman, in he would never in his own a new—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
