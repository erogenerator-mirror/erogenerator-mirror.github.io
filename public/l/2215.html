So we fucked, and we fucked hard.</p> <p>When we were fully hard, we cuddled and we fucked each other and we fucked ourselves, and I don't mean we had intercourse, no, our intercourse was with our minds and we got that as our sole purpose, it was to achieve, we saw, our first time together, to bring both our lives to a head and be made love to, to make love to, in every fashion, any form, any position, with that being what our bodies did for them, we fucked each other. It was the most wonderful, all time, most meaningful, most glorious, sexual, sensual, sexual sex, we had known in the past, for many years, that would have changed, or changed so much in the future, and then when all of a sudden my mother got what we wanted, and I, we fucked.</p> <p>I was surprised that my mother was so sexual, she was so fucking hot. I fucked her in a way, I took what I wanted, and I fucked her like that, without the slightest thought, just instinctive lust and love for her, or lust for me, the only thing I had in my heart, which I know she could never have. I didn't care if she was my parents, or was going to my parents when they left, that's just sex, and a woman can only fuck for so long. So I fucked my mother; and I love her, and I fucked her, and she loved it.</p> <p>And I fucked the shit out of her, as it turned out, and my mother loved her, because my father had died of a heart attack and he had passed away, and he had told my mother that she too was loved by her father, so that she could love him, too, whenever he lived. My mother loved her man to death, and she loved what I wanted, and what I was, what we were, not just fucking, but, to make love to my mother, if you will, in the way I just did. I loved how my mother was made love to, and the things that she thought made love to me, and my mother in the ways that made love to me, and, to be able to love. My mother loved everything that we did, everything that she wanted, and loved everything that we did, too.</p> <p>It was like our sexual relationship started, and went on, and on, and on; like we had never been without each other until we both had that first time together. And it was all part of the reason that we did it, even though we had been doing it that way for many years, and yet, it was incest, and yet, I loved it, and she loved it, because I was the only one who loved it, she loved me. I kissed my mother's forehead, for the first time that night, kissing her lips, her neck, and her cleavage, and I made love to her with words, in the way she knew what to do, and to enjoy.</p> <p>And we fucked.</p> <p>"Ooooh, Mom, it's good. It's good," my mother and I said, in a way that never had been said before. It was as though we had not given ourselves in any way as I had in the past; but we had. Our lust for each other started at having sex with ourselves, not with our own mother's, as we had sex with each other in the past, we just, like we had always done before, and fucked.</p> <p>So there we were; my mother and I sucking and kissing each other's tongues, sucking and kissing, licking and tasting our wet bodies and kissing and lapping and fucking every inch of each other's bodies. My mother kissed me and licked my pussy, and then her mother sucked and licked my pussy, and once she had licked my pussy, my mother kissed my pussy, and sucked it. I kissed her face, her mouth, her ears; her eyes, her hair, her hair and kissed her neck when she had my breast in her mouth. And we kissed while kissing, and I licked her breast while our tongues came into and were in and out, over and over, licking, kissing, licking, tonguing, sucking, licking; fucking each other as we loved.</p> <p>And when she came, it was wonderful, and I could feel her pussy clamping down on my tongue; I could feel her muscles squeezing my tongue and, and when she came, and the way of the way that I wanted, I wanted, she wanted, wanted. so wanted and, wanting and her, wanted to lick my tongue licked meâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
