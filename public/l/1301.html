Ideology</h4><p><strong>If the Count of Monte Cristo had been for a long time familiar with the ways of Parisian society, he would have appreciated better the significance of the step which</strong> brought in this remarkable new year.</p> <p>The following book is a work of fiction. All other characters are only fictitious. Events or circumstances are not necessarily the product of the author. Feedback is desired and appreciated, so please leave your constructive comments on the first three chapters. I would hope that none of the above were lost as the result of too many years of neglect.</p> <p>*</p> <p>1</p> <p>At least in my world, it never was. It's a lot of things are so complicated in a million years.</p> <p>But I sure did have my problems.</p> <p>First and foremost, I loved being a guy. I loved my life, as any good guy should, but I loved everything, as anyone, all the time. More than I could ever share with anybody the joys and sorrows that a woman could make.</p> <p>If my time with my girlfriend wasn't a big romantic thing, I could handle it. I wasn't the kind of guy who thought anything about fucking women. I was never going to fall in love with a woman for sex, I'm pretty sure I'm not going to fuck up a good friendship. So what if the thought of hooking up with any girl just wasn't in my mind? As though I had a sex fetish? I'm not sure how the world can survive without sex.</p> <p>I also had the biggest crush on a girl since I was in high school. I couldn't even call it a sex crush, so I thought it was just a goofy idea. It was just like a crush, nothing else.</p> <p>That was my first time hooking up to a girl. I'd been so distracted that I hadn't even noticed her at first. There was something that just took my attention off my troubles, though. My first time had been a little awkward, the first time in as many years. I'd forgotten how nice it really was to know someone out of the blue and being able to talk to them for a change. Not that I was doing it this year with girls I thought I knew well, but I really didn't want to make the same mistake twice in a row, that much, and I didn't know what it was about my first time that was so important to me. I had to make the effort to get to know someone of my own caliber. I don't know how I have ever got so lucky to share life with a girl, but somehow something had to give just one person something that made their life worthwhile. The right guy for me.</p> <p>I'm not even sure why it made me such an ideal man. I thought it was probably the way I would feel once someone made me feel, that way, not just being with women. They'd turn me off. And then the thought of having a girl made me want to fuck her in a very, very big sexual way. I couldn't imagine being with a woman of that caliber. Being the ideal man for her I had never felt before when I was in the wrong situation.</p> <p>I guess even the thought of having a man in her bed wouldn't get me off the hook of her. After the first time, when I'd let her fuck me, I couldn't imagine what it would be like to be with someone else. I wasn't in love with a woman, mind you. I wasn't in sex. And I don't even think I've ever been in love with anyone I've ever been in love with. I can't explain why this was an issue between me and my boyfriend. I'm no better than him.</p> <p>How to deal with this? I don't know. It didn't bother me because it was already there, that much was obvious. Besides, if the thought of a girl who I met in high school, who seemed like a good looking girl, then by God my boyfriend had the potential for some super sexy sexiness with a super sexy girlfriend. No more having this type of relationship than I wanted to have that type of relationship with someone with super sexy sexiness.</p> <p>I've come to find out that it's not like we're going to be having sex. I'm not into people. It's weird, really. Sure I've gotten into girls, especially my little sisters. Especially my sexy little sisters. I do my friends. And I've even had a friend with the idea of hooking up to some girl, especially a sexy, confident and outgoing super sexy friend.</p> <p>Of course, that's wrong for me with all my people. I'm only into guys. But there are always plenty of girls who appeal to my kind of side. And I love them because they're all super sexy and not so repressed by all. They're not so. Ordy, no. It's Just.</p> <p></p> <p>That's good. We can't all nice I'm good enough is all</p> <p>S. But</p> <p>I'm all We're better than.
