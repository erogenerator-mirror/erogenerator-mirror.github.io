Why should it trouble</h4><p><strong>thee? Let him look to it, whose sin it is.</strong> My hands caress my body. I think to myself with every caress.</p> <p>My back, my shoulders, my neck, my stomach. I think to himself. I think to myself. My hands stroke my body, caress my body, touch me, fondle me.</p> <p>My hands caress my sides with care. I think to myself. I think my hands slide over my curves, over my breasts, and then up to stroke my flesh. I think to myself, I think it's hard to remember, but it is. It is hard to focus on my hands, on my body.</p> <p>I think of the feelings that I must be experiencing.</p> <p>I think of the sensations that I must be experiencing. I think about how it must be to feel that way.</p> <p>I think about the desires that must be felt.</p> <p>I think about my legs, my thighs, my calves, and my thighs.</p> <p>I think about the places that all my body parts must be touching and being touched.</p> <p>I think about them being touched and being groped.</p> <p>I think about me being fucked.</p> <p>I think about the places that all my body parts must also be touching and being groped.</p> <p>I think about getting fucked, with my own hands, by someone else.</p> <p>I think about getting fucked again. I think about having sex again.</p> <p>I think about fucking again with a woman, and with our bodies, our bodies touching.</p> <p>I think about fucking again to another man.</p> <p>I think about fucking again and fucking again with two men at once.</p> <p>I think about the people involved, on their knees in the kitchen, fucking and fucking again, with their hands all over each other.</p> <p>I think about making the woman on the table again, before I'm done fucking her, before my hot cock can leave her pussy, before my hot man can fill her with his hot load of my hot man cum.</p> <p>I think of the feelings of seeing our bodies naked and fucking each other, before fucking our bodies, fucking our bodies together.</p> <p>I think about having sex with you, with me, with anyone else.</p> <p>I think about kissing you, your tongue in my mouth, your mouth on my lips, your tongue on my lips, your tongue on my lips.</p> <p>I think about you, lying beside me, kissing me.</p> <p>I think about fucking you with my hands, my cock, in your pussy.</p> <p>I think about fucking you with a strap-on.</p> <p>I think about having sex with you with a strap-on cock.</p> <p>I think about being fucked by you.</p> <p>I think about having sex with you.</p> <p>I think about the feelings that must be felt.</p> <p>I think about fucking you.</p> <p>I think about having sex with you.</p> <p>I think about having sex with you.</p> <p>I think about everything that must be possible to happen with us, now.</p> <p>I think about sex with you.</p> <p>I think about having sex with you, in your hotel room, right now.</p> <p>I think about feeling the way the way you feel about our bodies feeling, when I feel your body, when our bodies are touching each other.</p> <p>I think about having sex with you now.</p> <p>I think about doing this.</p> <p>I think about fucking you, in all your body parts, my legs, my balls, in my ass.</p> <p>I think about fucking you.</p> <p>I think about using you.</p> <p>I think about fucking you.</p> <p>I think about fucking you while having sex with you.</p> <p>I take off my clothes now, and put them in the hamper. Then grab the wet, wet washcloth and wipe the wet place with cold water. Then hold the washcloth over the washcloth, so the washcloth cannot be broken. I put the washcloth over the washcloth, to keep the washcloth from breaking.</p> <p>I stand up on my knees while I'm washing my body. My hands caress my body, and I'm sure that I touch my pussy.
