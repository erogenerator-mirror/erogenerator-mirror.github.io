The only thing missing from the equation is a damn good dick and a few lousy orgasms. That's why I took a shit!</p> <p>It occurred to me that maybe I should have at least taken the dildo out and turned off when I got home. Maybe I could have waited all my days to enjoy it so hard and so long that it felt like I would come on the spot, even if I didn't know the drill yet. A cock in your ass, another in your mouth, a cock in your pussy, or two different dildos all in one single thing seemed the perfect time to find out if you could be truly satisfied.</p> <p>Maybe, once I got home I might even find myself back in a room and just start making love in bed. It might even start out pretty normal, if you're not really into all the kinky stuff at all. Maybe you could pretend to be me on one time, just make up your body that way. And it would be okay, just wait until I got home. As I said, I love the dildo too. The idea of fucking myself with it would be kind of neat, you know? I just might try it!</p> <p>Yeah, I could have at least tried to pretend I wasn't in a relationship that's been going on for years—because hey, if I'm that good, she'd never know about it unless she wanted to bring up the subject again. There was really no point if I was too eager to give in. After all, it's not like I'm a complete stranger. After all, I have no idea what I'm really into or what I'm going to do with my life. That was my whole point to get out.</p> <p>After reading how to take a fake dick in one night, I decided I'd take my time and enjoy myself, to the music of course. Then, after a couple of weeks, and after the fun and games I'm sure I might like to go further, I finally took the dildo out of my ass. And it wasn't the first time I tried it. No, this isn't the first time either. I've been using it, on a couple of occasions. I never thought I'd get to use it again, but somehow I just couldn't take it anymore either. I started using that dildo in my pussy and ass the night before I came home to feel the excitement of having a real one inside me too. Then the thought crossed my mind—how much more of that kind of intensity could a girl get before she would just need some lube and a real one.</p> <p>So, after two weeks of this, I had a pretty decent idea. I had two days of free time, before I had to return to school and I just waited to tell my best friend about a good time we'd had.</p> <p>It started out as pleasant, as we were all friends: we have a pool, you know? So, after a few hours of playing, catching up, catching up with where we are and so on, we went back to our friends' house and had the pool to ourselves. We took long walks around and around the neighborhood and around the country. We had the house to ourselves, of course. We had a nice place and it was not terribly crowded.</p> <p>When we got to the house, we talked for a bit and ended up joining one of the many couples that just had the pool to themselves. We were not all that outgoing—it was a little weird at first to tell each other that we were into all of this social stuff, but then, once we started talking, it felt pretty good—really good. The conversation went like this: "Well, let's go swimming."</p> <p>"No," I told them, "don't swim."</p> <p>They went along with my lie. I was more interested in swimming than swimming. I'm sure you've seen me around a lot, but this part is a lot different. I mean it's a swimming pool, right? Well, yeah, I haven't been swimming in this pool in ages—ever. This is just my first time. I hadn't taken a lot of care of myself in the way I usually do. Oh no, I wasn't looking for a life raft, that's for sure. But now I'm not so sure. I mean, I still haven't made the decision of whether I was in a relationship at all.</p> <p>Well, as I remember it, it was probably a pretty good one too. It may seem obvious in some other place, but I'll tell you, sometimes I feel bad for leaving it to my best friend, because I've never really enjoyed her company. She and it's been hard to stay out to have sex with, ever since we've had such crazy relationship that, you know, and be with a couple of friends, friends that, it was different things for—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
