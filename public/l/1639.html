Their intercourse was painful enough by letter. How much worse, had</strong> their marriage been and the sex had just ended.</p> <p>'I'm sorry, Emma,' Harriet sobbed as she turned and embraced Emma. 'I'm sorry,' she repeated, almost sobbing again as she saw the look of happiness on her friend's face.</p> <p>'There was no problem at the weekend darling,' Harriet replied in sincere hope. 'You were wonderful. You were fantastic.'</p> <p>Emma thought she'd better let a minute go by. Harriet had been acting like a schoolgirl. She was so happy to return the compliment about sex that she felt better about Emma when she saw Harriet.</p> <p>'So I'm your first ever lover?' she asked as a final, soft kiss to her friend's lips.</p> <p>'I wasn't sure you knew what a lover was until that conversation with you. Of course I knew,' Emma told her best friend.</p> <p>Her friend leaned forward. Her lips moved up to Emma's ear. Her hands came forward to cup Emma's breasts. 'My heart is so full of love,' Emma breathed, feeling her nipples rise up against her friend's palms.</p> <p>'I don't know if I'd have dared kiss you like that,' Harriet whispered as her nipples tightened against Emma's skin.</p> <p>'Me neither. I'm pretty much over my limit,' Emma replied as her body responded to her best friend's touch.</p> <p>'There's a whole whole lot I want to do this weekend,' Harriet told her best friend. 'You can come too if you like. If you like,' Emma said as she kissed her best friend's chest one more time before moving downward on the beautiful woman.</p> <p>She slid her tongue down Emma's belly where the blonde hairs were trimmed neatly into the shape of a heart. Her lips felt as though they could suck on any hair she had ever had.</p> <p>A shudder ran through Emma's body at the touch of Claire's tongue. 'Yes!' Emma moaned as Harriet's tongue slid over her navel and then her thigh. Emma felt the wetness of her friend's sex beneath her fingers. It excited her because she wanted to be with Claire. It felt so wonderful. It had been so long since she'd actually allowed herself to enjoy a woman and feel her body so close to the woman she imagined she would love so much.</p> <p>Harriet felt a tremble go through her body as her tongue slid over the soft surface under Emma's navel. Her finger slid inside Emma to feel the softness of her friend's pussy. A shudder went through her friend's body. She felt as though she were in some sort of sexual fog and she couldn't believe that she was enjoying this.</p> <p>Her fingers moved slowly over the soft skin of Emma's thighs. She didn't bother to touch the sensitive skin over the lips between the legs between her friend's thighs. She rubbed her hand over the soft fabric covering Emma's sex. Her fingers parted Emma's pussy hair to reveal Emma's clit.</p> <p>Emma whimpered when her best friend's tongue touched her clit with the tip of her tongue. Her thighs shook when her pussy responded by swelling under her friend's ministrations. She was so excited that it felt as though she might explode. She closed her thighs together around Harriet's hand.</p> <p>'Let me,' she whispered. 'I want to go to bed with you.'</p> <p>'Me too,' Harriet replied. 'Now let me love you with my mouth.'</p> <p>Her legs opened wider. Her heart beat louder as each of the fingers of her friend's hand massaged her sex.</p> <p>Harriet felt Emma's hand on her own cunt. It was warm and wet and she was excited in a way that she hadn't felt in a long time. She was almost as aroused as Emma was.</p> <p>Emma couldn't help but cry out when she slid two fingers inside herself. Her clit screamed with excitement as the feeling of Claire's tongue over her clitoris was so wonderful. She slid her fingers in and out of herself without even thinking.</p> <p>'Oh, my God! I'm going to explode!' she cried out as her clitoris and vaginal walls massaged the fingers of her best friend's mouth. She was a bit embarrassed at the noise she made but she was too turned on to care.</p> <p>'I'm coming, I'm coming!' Emma squealed into her best friend's ear as her orgasm surged through her body.</p> <p>'So soon!' she cried as all of her muscles tensed and her sex seemed to explode in ecstasy. She wanted to lie on top of her friend's naked body but for a moment. just for ever and her orgasm. Her friend's sake. for what could last. as though it should be her body.
