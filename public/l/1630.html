Mr. Weston directed</strong> one of his employees to meet him at his desk after work. After they arrived, the secretary took a briefcase off the shelf, loaded it with their usual lunch and brought the case over to Mike, a junior accounting student. "We've got a very nice and very nice lunch ready," he said. "Would you like to go into your office? Maybe we can have a few seconds alone."</p> <p>Mike nodded, "Yes, my boss could be a lot more than just my boss. If my boss's boss likes me, he could be my boss, you could be right."</p> <p>"Oh, that's too bad," the secretary said, "I wish someone in my position could be a lot more than a little bit less than a little bit."</p> <p>"Well, he has already been fired as of right now, and he doesn't even have a name for the job. Maybe his name is Tom, and he may work for his boss, but he is really not someone everyone can hire on a first name basis."</p> <p>"That's true," the secretary said, "But if you want to try the job, I have one open position waiting for you."</p> <p>"I can't have the entire thing. I'll have to find someone else."</p> <p>"It's so nice to meet you," the secretary said, as she took Mike's hand and pulled him to the door. "You know I couldn't have you on the job tomorrow night."</p> <p>"I've been a little busy, so I need to come down here before we go to bed."</p> <p>"Oh, you're just a little bit nervous that you'll have company on your desk," the secretary said, as Mike's hand started to slide under her skirt. "I'm sure some guys will be willing to be willing to be willing to have company in the office."</p> <p>Mike's cock was starting to get hard. This was going to be fun and interesting, indeed. He would be having company all day. As he pushed his cock against her, she took his hand, put it on her pussy, and rubbed it around her clit. She felt his fingers on her pussy, and her hips were starting to thrust against his fingers. She was not as wet as she had been with the exception that she was soaking his fingers in her juices. Mike moved his hand down, found her asshole, and pushed his middle finger inside. He wondered how she kept her skirt so short in her hurry to get home so she could change out of it and get his cock inside of her. She pushed her pussy down upon his cock, and he felt her clit rubbing the tip of his dick. He tried pushing all the way in; not that he was ready to try taking it all, but his cock was not ready to be pulled all the way out. He pushed hard against her, but it was only a matter of time before he pushed hard as they heard her door opening.</p> <p>"That's a nice cock," she said, as she pulled his face towards her and kissed him. Mike pushed his tongue into her mouth, and she gave him a tongue bath of the same taste as she'd given him just a couple of minutes earlier. She ran her hand along his cock, got it all the way into her hands, and held it there while they kissed. He took it and moved it against her ass with the same rhythm she was making on it against her pussy.</p> <p>She pulled her lips away from his kiss, and looked around. Mike had pulled his cock out of his pants, and was looking around for a way to put it over her skirt. He took his cock, pushed it forward, and he felt it slide along her wet slit, as she held his cock, and guided it gently inside of her. Even if she did just slide her fingers in and around her clit, it was a much bigger thing than she had imagined. She felt every inch of his cock slide inside her, and felt his cock enter her pussy slowly as her head dropped back onto the desk.</p> <p>She let his cock slide back into her wetness, and pushed it out again. "Yes," she said as she let his cock enter her again. The movement of her hips against his body made Mike's cock rub between her pussy lips. She felt his head brushing along her lips, and felt his cock slide past her clit into her pussy. "You have a nice cock. I'll have a bit of a party this time, and I'll bring you home real late."</p> <p>"Sounds good," Mike said as he moved around the desk to stand next to her. He rubbed the outside of her pussy, felt his head touch the edges of her clit, and felt her juices, and the opening of her body. "And you do you're a few ways tonight, I'll take good." She was all of the job for him, and his cock, yes. The only now for himâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
