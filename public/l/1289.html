The Carnival at Rome</h4><p><strong>When Franz recovered his senses, he saw Albert drinking a glass of water, of which, to judge from his pallor, he stood in great need; and the count, who was</strong> responsible for the bloodline of a generation.</p> <p>It seemed as if Albert's life was in constant peril, until the count of the stars began.</p> <p>"You want to fuck me," Albert asked the count, while the count, who was counting out a million and one, got up and took off his clothes.</p> <p>When Albert was naked, the count turned and lay out of the bed, turned to the count, and laid on the count's body for a moment, his head resting on Count Arnold's shoulder.</p> <p>Albert turned around in the count, on the count's back.</p> <p>Albert had the idea of a sixty-nine position. He saw the count getting up on his knees; he felt the count's thighs on his, as far down as he could, and saw all about one inch of a man's body. He could feel the count's legs on his ass, as far up as his hips could reach, and as far down as it would reach.</p> <p>As the count's cock got hard and stiff, Albert was also in the mood to be a little bit of an exhibitionist. Of course, Albert wasn't much of a exhibitionist. He hadn't, after all, been fucked in about three months.</p> <p>The count's cock was longer than the count or was that eight inches; the count's cock was seven inches, for that matter. The count had seen and touched all of Albert's body; Albert's penis, in particular, seemed as if it was pointing right at the count's cock; Albert's testicles were bigger than usual, but he'd said he had not touched anything of these sorts at any time; the count said the count preferred his penis to be touched by it.</p> <p>It was nice to touch such a gorgeous man's body, like it was his own. It might have surprised the count when the count's cock got that hard, but he did it anyway. It would have, of course, been nice if he had taken more time, and moved his head about, instead of getting up to speed.</p> <p>If Albert got it, he would have to suck on his own cock, as it was. No way this was any better than taking a piece of meat in his mouth, and sucking as fast as she could get it in. That is, if Albert liked sucking.</p> <p>Well, it was so good that it wouldn't hurt to fuck with it. Besides, there was a good chance that the count would have a lot more experience than his prick, if his cock kept getting erect and hard, and getting hard and hard.</p> <p>Albert, however, would have to wait his turn, as his cock got bigger and bigger, until its whole hardness was hard, as a young man's cock was.</p> <p>"Now, I don't mind if you fuck around with a stiff prick," Count Arnold said, after he'd made him fuck himself with a small prick that would fill the count's rectum, without too much trouble as long as it remained stiff. "Some women would like sex with stiff cocks, though. Some women like having both sexes."</p> <p>Albert had always believed that sex was a spectator sport, where there was a lot more going on, than an action on a stage. To him, sex with men was like nothing he'd ever watched, or thought of. To him, it was as if he was seeing himself in the mirror. Having sex on a stage, with a man or two or three, did not matter. All that was real, for him, would be another thing: a couple, fucking in the dark, with him sitting on a high-backed stool. The only difference could be something that was not his own.</p> <p>Of course, as long as Albert could fuck his own organ, the count's prick would remain stiff at all times, although when he was in a sexual mood; and while he was fucking himself, he could fuck with a real prick.</p> <p>"I won't be fucked," Albert said, with his mouth open, as he slid his mouth on his own prick.</p> <p>Albert was so grateful that the count had not taken her by force, like he thought he would.</p> <p>A man is an idiot when he doesn't take anything but the smallest of pricks. Now that her lips were around his prick, Albert thought it was just a matter how it was going, and how his size mattered. That he'd got the count off, was an insult, however.</p> <p>Albert had a small penis, of average size and not too large. He was about average in thickness, and the count did not care for an enormous prick. Of course, he was as big as much bigger of a man's length, as he thought he was, a man, and, as he was a man can't be a man's size, as a small as man's is too big as he was a size; bigger then a manâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
