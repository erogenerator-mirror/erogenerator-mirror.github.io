English by Fyodor Dostoyevsky </h3><h4>CHAPTER IV</h4><p><strong>His mother’s letter had been a torture to him, but as regards the chief fact in it, he had felt not one moment’s hesitation, even whilst he was reading the</strong> words she had written, the real pleasure of it was just to have her naked body under the duvet.</p> <p>The real pleasure came when she had told him in a clear and honest matter of fact, what did it matter if she had been a virgin for him if she had been a virgin? Was there anything he could do to ensure that if she had only had been a virgin to him if she had not only had been had by a man? Of course there were still a lot more possibilities, but it wasn’t like she had to have been a virgin in any way! He had enjoyed that, and now that she was a virgin he really got the whole scenario. Her face had been beautiful, her body had been tight and smooth, when she had first told him of the feelings she had experienced during the experience. Her pussy was perfect, her tight clit protruded from her lips, and her lips were moist and beckoning. She told him in fact was a virgin for him if she hadn’t had a boyfriend that he knew what a man wanted, and he had seen the look of a boyish innocence in both her face, her face and the way her mouth and her breasts were looking at him. He couldn’t have helped the way she had looked at his cock, and when she had seen that she hadn’t just seen it! He had felt a bit embarrassed as she hadn’t just seen his cock…not just his body itself but what it did to his life. But here he had looked a different boy, his body was better now, he was a man, he loved his body too, even the feel of an erection! Of course this was a girl not only wanting his body, but also wanting his touch….but then there hadn’t been any actual sex, at least in the sense of any romantic relationship it was more like a man’s penis.</p> <p>The way she looked at his cock while he took her virginity in the first place when he had seen her naked, it made him feel excited, excited at hearing her scream her virginity. If it wasn’t for that, that was the point of their little affair. His mouth on her pussy had been different, a bit firmer, but her pussy didn’t taste so bad, it was still warm and very wet. He had gone back to the letter of her brother as well, when he had looked at his own cock, her pussy had been a different one, but he hadn’t known it would feel as good as it did. He had fucked her twice, both times with just one other person, but both times he had fucked her, they had really taken their time for the sake of fucking. Of course the second fucking had been different. He had kissed her, and even sucked her clit. And again, his own cock had felt different to his own. For sure it felt a bit different to his own penis, and he had felt that it would feel nice to have it inside her. But he was going to make love to his mother while she had taken his virginity…but first he had to go and make love to his mother…and if she was going to be the first to take his cock inside her….</p> <p>He had put down his thoughts and just fucked his mother while he took an erection. It was a strange thing, making out with a girl that he had never really imagined. This was even, though it was quite different, to actually having intercourse with a virgin. He felt like he could have tried something with a virgin before, and when he had tried it with his own girlfriend it had felt nice! But he couldn’t have done it with any girl. He couldn’t even think that what he was trying felt like a real situation. He didn’t mean to want to try that…</p> <p>That was why he had been in his bedroom reading her words, but he didn’t think it mattered to him whether or not she had taken her virginity or not. She wouldn’t have been able to give himself a virgin either, but if the situation had been different then he would have wanted to know that she had taken herself.</p> <p>He had been tempted by imagining just how she would have felt when he was inside her. Would she really be able to give herself to him even before his virginity was taken? The thought had scared him. It had seemed so unreal, if only he could have imagined her giving herself to him in real life…how would she feel if…he had taken her virginity? He had never really believed in the innocence of having intercourse with a girl’s boyfriend as the only when she had given herself to her a lover at first boyfriend. She looked beautiful and only.</p> <p></p> <p>Of course it being a good to thinking about it he had been in her he thought she gave herself. Of feeling the feeling the way he had not her—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
