G. Wells </h3><h4>A Sudden Shock</h4><p><strong>“As I stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man, the full moon, yellow and gibbous, came up out of an overflow of silver light in the north-east.</strong> “There, at last!” I shouted, as if I could be anything else.</p> <p>At the top of the sky above the base of the rock, the moon still stood proud, so bright and bright that it shone as though it were made of glass. I reached out to grab it, and found my hand was immediately grasped by the hard, white, muscular surface of the mountain. My skin was warm and moist, and it felt very good to touch the warmth of those very stones. I had to have more than one mind to do so, but I felt I should have waited. The only thing I wanted from this place was for my cock to go inside of her, which, if I was honest, I could hardly.</p> <p>Her tongue darted out from her mouth to meet those sparkling stone eyes. She didn’t hesitate before moving her mouth down to meet mine. Her hand moved to my dick, which jumped, and began to move up and down its shaft in an up and down motion. I was glad of all this foreplay, but I had a real need to fuck the woman who was now under my touch. I felt her tongue probe gently, and flick my slit, and she pulled back a little.</p> <p>I felt that tongue move on and on, up and down my shaft. It was a wonderful sensation, and I began to rock my hips, trying not to push it in. The rock of the mountain was soft and firm, yielding as I stroked my penis up and down as we kissed. I felt the softness of her hair, and my hands slid from her head down over her shoulders.</p> <p>They stopped on her tits, which heaved slightly from the weight of my hands on them. They were firm and well-sculpted from the effort of my movements and the effort of my dick-penis moving around and around them. My dick felt like it was going to come out of her with each movement of those nipples, so hard and erect in my palms. It felt like her tits were making a firm round jiggle just as much as she was doing! She continued to lick my cock for a moment while she took some more of my cock in her mouth, and started doing similar things in her mouth.</p> <p>I thought I was going to come already if I touched her up there. This was all new to me, with the love and passion that a tongue and lips are capable of. Perhaps now was the best time to bring myself to climax. I was still a little shy about having sex with her while we were fully clothed, and I wanted to make her feel good.</p> <p>I placed my fingertips in her hair, and lifted her head up in order to kiss me there first in her mouth. She was very good at it, and I realized that she’d been practicing for me. This was a moment I wanted to hold on to, and she responded well, too.</p> <p>We kissed for a while. This was new to her. I felt something I hadn’t realized before that the tongue licking my cock was exciting me. I wasn’t sure how to react, but it felt good to have her tongue caressing me, and it was exciting to have such a wonderful girl kissing my cock. Then I could feel her mouth being pressed up against the tip.</p> <p>She was going to give me the fuck of a condom again.</p> <p>The lips went away from my dick and began working back and forth in a circular motion. I couldn’t think of what to do next, so I lifted her head up and put some pressure on the back of her neck, pulling her face toward it. Just as I’d done in the woods back at the base of the mountain, I put a finger across her lips, encouraging her to suck it. It was only for a minute, but it felt like almost ten seconds, and I was ready for this lady to take a cock inside her mouth. I was still a little shy about being naked, and I couldn’t say exactly when I was doing this, but I found my hand slipping down into her hair. She didn’t pull away, and I felt my finger run into her hair as she continued sucking on my dick.</p> <p>My finger went all the way in, my fingernail scraping against the roof of her mouth, and the roof of her mouth. She started to get into the rhythm of the licking, and so did I! I began to move my hips faster with this lady, and she started to suck even more firmly on the tip. This went on for as long as I could stand it, and I could feel my orgasm nearing.</p> <p></p> <p>I had to come, so I just reached down on her tits now. I grabbed both of my hands around the back of her head and helped her, and took one in my fingers slid it forward so—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
