The Hand of God</h4><p><strong>Caderousse continued to call piteously, “Help, reverend sir, help!” “What is the matter?” asked Monte Cristo. “Help,” cried Caderousse; “I am murdered!” “We are here;—take courage.” “Ah, it’s all over!</strong>” they heard, Caderousse shouting. “Help, help;” the crowd cheered, “Help us, help us.”</p> <p>Monte Cristo led them up a narrow wall, beyond a trellis and into an alley at the end of the alley. Caderousse and Monte looked at each other, both wanting to have their revenge. “Help, get off me,” Caderousse shouted. They heard footsteps approaching the crowd, then a man, dressed in gray shirt and pants, approached Monte Cristo, and said:</p> <p>“I’m Cam, by the way;”. Caderousse, feeling slightly out of shape, stepped out on his own, and moved with the crowd until he felt a large body against him.</p> <p>“Cadet! help me, help me!” Caderousse and Monte stood side-by-side, feeling the man’s arms tighten around them as Monte stepped off-balance. They moved in sync with the pounding music, and Caderousse turned his head to say:</p> <p>“Help me;”</p> <p>“Help!” Caderousse followed.

He pulled Monte toward him. “Suck me, Monte. Suck me,” Caderousse commanded, and Monte reached back and put his lips around Monte’s cock, as Monte pulled Cader into him with his hands. His cock filled Caderousse’s mouth and he felt Cam’s throat muscles work it over in a delicious caress, as he held Monte by the waist with his hands and pushed his ass up to meet their thrusting. He felt Caderousse’s cock harden further under him for a moment, then he felt Monte’s cock expand, then, almost without pause, his ejaculate began shooting into Cader’s mouth.</p> <p>“Oh, Cam! Jesus!” Monte gasped, “Your cock is big on me. It really knows how to fuck!”</p> <p>They pulled away from him, and turned toward the crowd, all eyes on them as they took turns blowing each other. The crowd cheered and hollered in surprise, as Monte and Cam continued to fuck Cader—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
