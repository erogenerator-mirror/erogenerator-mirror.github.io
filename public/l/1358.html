The Cemetery of Père-Lachaise</h4><p><strong>M. de Boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking Valentine to her last home on earth. The weather was dull and stormy, a cold wind shook the</strong> ground and it made the funeral car very quiet.</p> <p>There were four of them. All of them were older than her, in their 40's and 40's, each of them had married at the time. One, who had to be Eric's twin brother, was tall, handsome and he too had the best smile ever.</p> <p>Her husband and his wife were both tall and muscular; the younger one had long red hair and had a large, bright smile. Her husband's wife, whom everyone around him considered to be his equal, was the shorter one.</p> <p>They also played on the same music system, played their father's songs on the TV's and listened to their music.</p> <p>They all wore different clothes, some still were from their childhoods, they were dressed very casually, many did not bother to go out shopping.</p> <p>The only exception was the wedding dress made her look like she had taken it off in the mall. The dress didn't come off very well. It didn't stay up very well. It just seemed to be getting shorter as the weather got colder. The same could be said of the wedding dresses.</p> <p>The wedding dress was made all of the time but the only exception was the reception they gave for the family. The wedding was held in the church, in their country with the help of the local church's family.</p> <p>Their marriage was good, the people that got married were nice people, and they all agreed with her decision to marry the man she was going to marry.</p> <p>The ceremony was beautiful, even for an old woman and it took place over Christmas.</p> <p>They had to go to the reception at the same time, so that was also the reason they were married.</p> <p>When their mother came up that night, they each had their usual cocktail and after dinner they sat in the living room and talked together. They started talking about their childhood and their lives, especially the music.</p> <p>"It's so nice coming back. We've all been talking, I'll never forget it," she said. "I'll always remember when the last time we're together is during that Christmas Eve."</p> <p>"Yes, you will," he replied.</p> <p>Eric's sister came over to the table and joined them.</p> <p>"Hi kids, your wedding and all-round mother and son were here," she said cheerfully. "This is my brother and my boyfriend. My father's brother, Eric's father, Eric's brother."</p> <p>"Yes, dear family I understand. We all have our parents, so how should we celebrate now?" he asked.</p> <p>"Why don't we go and enjoy their company tonight?" she said as an afterthought.</p> <p>They left for their new home and the wedding reception took place at the same time. They got to the reception shortly, as it was in the same town the bride was to attend, on December 31.</p> <p>As soon as they were out of earshot they had decided to have a drink after dinner.</p> <p>That's when they heard the noise in the kitchen, which caused them to peek out.</p> <p>They saw the same redhead in the kitchen. Eric's sister, Sarah, saw them, smiled and hugged them. The redhead introduced them to Eric and Sarah said that they're the sisters of his family.</p> <p>They all made their way to their own house at the same time, which had also to the same time as the wedding reception.</p> <p>The bride and groom did their best to make a couple. He had a nice build but had a really cute smile. He really couldn't talk much, especially when he had someone else to talk to.</p> <p>As soon as he entered the bedroom, he asked her to remove her clothes and sit on the edge.</p> <p>"How was your honeymoon honey?" she asked him.</p> <p>"Mmmm, wonderful, a nice, warm honeymoon, we'll be back to normal in the next year," he said as he started to unbutton his suit pants.</p> <p>She unbuttoned the top, letting him see the fullness of her breasts. He moved over her, pressing himself against her belly. She pushed back against him, feeling his cock inside. They kissed again, their tongues dancing together.</p> <p>Sarah got off the bed and got on it facing Eric. He got behind her, his cock against her pussy lips. He grabbed her breasts in his hands and started to squeeze them gently.</p> <p>The kissing stopped for a moment, as they heard a moan coming from Eric's sister. She leaned back and saw the sight of her brother's cock sliding in and and the pussy from behind. She looked at him, at last night after a night of lust. Then, he was looking down his sister and for her brother's cock moving in his own pussy and with one of. As he was to see it.
