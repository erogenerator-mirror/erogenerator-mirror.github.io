But</strong> the subject of Acquired Knowledge is on the right use of Science.</p> <p>And, as to the word, "bondage," which might be just the right word; my brain is saying to be in tune to it. So, the word should be able to be understood. Like:</p> <p>"You love your wife, or don't you?"</p> <p>And, it should be clear in any sentence, it should be clear.</p> <p>And, after hearing this word:</p> <p>"You're making love to her."</p> <p>You should be a good man. It should be obvious.</p> <p>And, it should be clear.</p> <p>"You'll soon get me married. I swear. And, if you're lucky, I'll get you in the wedding."</p> <p>As for my wife, it should be clear. If, and the point is, if the point is that she's happy, we should be all a part of a long and happy marriage.</p> <p>Maybe she'll get pregnant before we're married, maybe she'll have three babies, or, maybe, she'll want something bigger, a bigger penis. Perhaps, she'll want to know what it tastes like, or maybe she'll want to know if it's a special taste of semen, or should it always have a special taste.</p> <p>"I'm not going to make him cum now. There's plenty of time for everything else."</p> <p>As for her favorite thing, the thing that ought to get you to be with her sexually, she ought to always have a condom on. If she's ever in the mood for some oral, she should be ready.</p> <p>"You don't have to take me. I'll take the other way."</p> <p>If she's in the mood for sex too, she should want to have an orgasm before taking him.</p> <p>"I said no."</p> <p>If you'll fuck her while I'm in your sexy wife's sexy pussy--you'd like to do that, right?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>It'd be a miracle what they say.</p> <p>"But it'll be a lot longer, I guarantee you."</p> <p>Would she make it with him after he takes her? Wouldn't he? Wouldn't he?</p> <p>"He'll come in any minute."</p> <p>"He might. I'm sure. He'll come in any minute."</p> <p>When she gets pregnant, we might be in for a good ten years together. And, when they're both on their way to being sexually active together, there'll be a chance to have children.</p> <p>She thinks she'll never make it to having her babies.</p> <p>"It really isn't that important."</p> <p>She thinks it just might be, right?</p> <p>"It's not. I'm sure it's just too soon. I mean...."</p> <p>"We'll see," she'd say if he wouldn't, with a straight face. "You know you'll never love me no matter what. I'm already starting to like you."</p> <p>What about her husband? Will he love her?</p> <p>"I already told him that."</p> <p>You're not going to tell him? You wouldn't do that?</p> <p>"He'll probably like it. He'd probably like the idea, wouldn't he?"</p> <p>You'd think he'd take her husband's virginity, and let her marry him, and leave her a couple of kids.</p> <p>I won't have to. I won't, though. I will have to think about it.</p> <p>*</p> <p>"Hey, Dad, how's the trip going today?"</p> <p>"You know, Mr. S. I haven't been able to think at all, all day."</p> <p>"Well, just go in to the office, I'll be there right after breakfast."</p> <p>I was feeling rather tired after making breakfast and having the thought that it might be nice to have time alone to think about it. "OK, Dad. I'll be there. I'll wait until you're home."</p> <p>"Nonsense. I'll have time to think about it while I'm gone. See you in the morning."</p> <p>I was almost asleep when I heard him say, "OK, Dad. Now that's one thing about the trip--nothing else."</p> <p>I was in the bathroom just as he started the shower. I was washing my hair. I was wearing my bathrobe, and since I had no panties around, my robe was hanging loosely. Just like Mrs. S. she had called it.</p> <p>In the bathroom, she came over to me, reached behind me and unbuttoned my robe. She'd it, and then slid her hand. "I've not been thinking about you as to come in. I don't go to be ready and you in. I think it." and hold you just you in yourâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
