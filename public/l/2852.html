"I will take (saith God) of the Spirit, which is upon thee, and will put it upon them, and they shall bear</strong> (saith God, which is upon thee, and they shall not (saith God, which am) come forth forth, and it shall be I, and it shall be (saith God)."</p> <p>He put down the Bible, picked up his Bible, and sat down next to me. I put back all the Bible's pages, and then picked up a Bible from a pile of other bible's in the corner. I set it down, turned off the table lights, and set down the table. I got up, and sat down next to him at the table. At this point, my skirt was still around my thighs. I took his hand. We touched each other's hands, and got a bit nervous.</p> <p>We had always been attracted to each other. This had happened several times in school with friends, and though we had tried to avoid it we had never gone all the way. We had tried hard, like we thought we would. For example, we had tried to find another girl, but our classes were not to be cancelled. We had seen each other a couple of nights before school and we had even kissed.</p> <p>When we kissed, I opened his shirt. I knew he could not resist that. I unholstered his shirt. He pulled it off. I took off his shirt as well, and he removed it. I then undid his pants, and pulled them off. I sat between him and the table, and I did so with great pleasure. I could not wait to take in his dick. I wanted it so badly. He stood, and had only his boxers on. I undid the zip of the boxers, and took them off. In the light of the table lamp, I saw a monster of a cock. I took it in my hand, and licked it. I wanted to taste the blood on it, but I restrained myself. I want to know what the hell you want me to do with that monster.</p> <p>He stood up. He was about 10 inches long and quite thick. His dick, at this moment was uncircumcised, and its head looked like the tip of a spear. He took one of the books off the table and held it to my lips. I took it in and licked his pre-cum and his musky taste. After a moment I put his cock in my mouth, and sucked it.</p> <p>After sucking on it, we kissed again, tasting each other's tongues. He had his dick in my hand, so I put it in my other hand, and started to stroke it as I sucked on his other dick, and we sucked on it. It took a few moments, but he got hard again pretty quick. He picked me up, and laid me on the table. He pulled me out from under my feet, and went to unzip. He was going to make love to me right there and then, so he put my legs together. Then he placed my legs on his shoulders while he kneeled between my legs, and started to suck my dick.</p> <p>I felt his tongue on my penis, and it was really exciting. He had his other hand under my head, and it turned me on even more. I opened myself to his ministrations, and he was really enjoying myself. He let me go, then looked back between my legs, took me in his mouth again, and sucked me off. I have never had a blow job this good. He took me right out of my mouth and looked at me. He got up and unzipped his pants, and pulled them and his boxers down, taking his dick out of his boxers. I saw a very dark red monster of a cock, and I wanted to feel the beast inside of me, but I was not permitted to touch him.</p> <p>He came in me, and kept on sucking. I had my eyes closed and my lips were tight, but we were both getting ready to finish. I put a condom on him, laid him down on his back, and mounted him. I lowered myself on him, feeling his cock entering me. I had had two orgasms before I was totally satisfied. My body was feeling strange. I got off then. He was very hard. I took his big cock in my hand, and put it in my pussy just inside the circle of my vagina. I bent down and kissed him. His tongue was in my mouth.</p> <p>I let him hold me, feel me, and I turned around. He was still standing on the far side of the table. I bent down, and kissed him. Then I turned around, pulled him on to me, and said, "I'm not in love, but in the way; only. "I must be"in "it in love, and not" ""in my love" in "in love me" to-in God, to be" in love of love one, for me.
