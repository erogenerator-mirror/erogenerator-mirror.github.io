Is this then a thing of that worth, that for it my soul should</h4><p><strong>suffer, and become worse than it was? as either basely dejected, or disordinately affected, or confounded within itself, or terrified? What can there be, that thou shouldest so much esteem?</strong> "I've got to go!" she declared.</p> <p>"But I'm going to make us a table in my room," she reminded me.</p> <p>"I'm going to make a table in your room?"</p> <p>"My room? It'll be a very nice surprise for us both," she insisted.</p> <p>"You'll always have it, baby girl. Oh, I have plans for it," I assured her.</p> <p>She was such a fucking bitch!</p> <p>"That's not good, you hear?" she said.</p> <p>My cock ached in my briefs.</p> <p>"I know," I assured her, "but I promise you'll enjoy it! And you better like it, too, because I don't intend to force you, but I sure don't want you to feel cheated. Promise me."</p> <p>"Okay," she said, her tone unperturbed.</p> <p>I took her in my arms, and kissed her lips. She moaned and turned. She was a sexy, desirable woman. But I'd lost my appetite. We'd always been best friends. Now, I was only afraid of the consequences of my actions, and what she had to endure while I kept my distance. I'd always been sure I could handle this.</p> <p>She sighed and sighed when I pulled her to me. Her lips parted at the mere thought of doing it again. My cock throbbing as my heart was thundering in my ears.</p> <p>"We'll talk about this later," she promised.</p> <p>"Yes," I agreed, "but right now I need to get myself some breakfast," and I kissed her one last time.</p> <p>"Don't you have something more planned?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, baby," she purred, "but right now, I would rather spend the day fucking a stranger than having you fuck me!"</p> <p>"You're right," I agreed, "but I think I have more..."</p> <p>She kissed me again, then got up and walked to the fridge. "Oh, I fixed something big for breakfast," she informed me.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, definitely," I assured her.</p> <p>And I knew just what she intended to fix.</p> <p><8>â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
