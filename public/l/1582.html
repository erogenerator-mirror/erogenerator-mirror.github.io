English by Fyodor Dostoyevsky </h3><h4>CHAPTER III</h4><p><strong>He hurried to Svidrigaïlov’s. What he had to hope from that man he did not know. But that man had some hidden power over him. Having once recognised this, he</strong> had taken this opportunity to prove his skills to the world. With a smile on his chiselled face, he gave this man a big kiss full of passion. After the embrace had ended, he slowly stroked his fingers down the man’s arm, feeling his touch as much as when they were inside his shirt. ’Wow’ he had always loved the feel of the silky material of the man’s shirt against his skin. He felt his dick stirring, and his hands dropped to cup his head, his tongue feeling it as he gently caressed the top of his head. The scent of the man’s cologne made him shudder with desire. His tongue went directly to his ear to ask if he had a special pleasure, before he quickly kissed his neck, moving lower to his collar bone. Then with a sly smile, he licked a line down the line of his left shoulder to his rib cage before continuing past it into his chest.</p> <p>Lying back, he closed his eyes and savouring the sensation that his soft, warm hands brought to the soft skin of his inner thighs. The feeling was exquisite. He had always been a sensitive person, and could not help the sudden urge to kiss him. His dick started to stand at attention. His hands went to work, moving down his abs and to his cock, lightly stroking, making little mouthing sounds.</p> <p>He pulled away from that sexy mouth, and slowly made his way to his dick. He had always felt so hard, his body trembling with anticipation. He quickly put his hand over the man’s dick head, gently stroking as he lowered his head again to suckling on his cock. That felt so good. It wouldn’t take long for him to come. Suddenly, the tip of his pinkie made a loud noise as it slipped inside his mouth. His hands left his dick and came up to circle the cock head as he swirled his tongue around it. That felt so good. His other hand came to gently stroke the shaft as it came out of his mouth. It seemed to be pulsating hard.</p> <p>That guy looked so manly, and his cock pulsated in his hand. His balls were gently bouncing against him as he continued to suck. He felt himself getting harder as he looked up at him, loving the look of pure lust that came over his dark lover.</p> <p>He wanted to make a move on this man, to feel his naked body against him. His eyes never left his lover’s as his lust filled head rose and turned until the tip of his tongue touched his lips. So close, so close.</p> <p>His lips parted and his tongue shot out into his lover’s mouth to taste. He could feel it, the feeling of his tongue tasting his sweet mouth. Kissing him tenderly and loving his response to his tenderness.</p> <p>As his hands cupped his lover’s cock, he slowly lowered his mouth to a hard, full, erect penis. He wrapped both of his hands around its tip, his fingers wrapping around it in a tight grip. He slowly stroked it, making small movements with his fingers, as it grew harder and harder until finally he could take it no further with a loud moan. He started to pull his hand away and smiled down at him as he sucked his bottom lip into his mouth, making little sounds. Then he started stroking faster, feeling the man’s cock pulsing between his fingers, the sound loud in the quiet night.</p> <p>His head lowered back down to kiss and he started to pump his hand hard, pulling the man’s cock out of his mouth to suck on his bottom lip. He heard his lover moan, and then he felt a hand reach around him and cup his balls. He was about to cum before his hand could grasp the cock again and started to rub the underside of his dick as his finger stroked on his bottom lip. His heart beat faster as he felt the man’s thumb brush against the tip of his cock. He had to taste him before he came. Pulling his tongue out of his mouth, he opened his lips and slid it into his mouth, just as his lips closed over the head of the man’s dick.</p> <p>His hot, wet tongue slid all the way down the man’s slick, throbbing cock. He looked up at him as he sucked, savouring the man’s taste, his lips taking the man’s taste, as far down in. both their mouths started to rock hard shafts at the other. their lips together, sliding back then back together before they moved back with a moan to each to make a low groan a groan the other. a lust s lips in a groan—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
