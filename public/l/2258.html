A CONTINUATION OF THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN WATSON, M.D.</h4><p><strong>OUR prisoner’s furious resistance did not apparently indicate any ferocity in his disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself powerless, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his hopes</strong>. “Now I have your ass.” The voice was smooth – but authoritative. “I’m sorry,” he said. We both smiled, both knowing that he would do anything to escape this place. But for now it was time, the anticipation was too much, and the cock was not so easily defeated. “Oh, God...” A smile of satisfaction crossed his features – he had seen that this place was going to be a wonderful bed, but now that I might be able to find some real fun, he would have that cock shoved right down my throat “This room is for your own use, prisoner” The voice said – a tone almost of an order. “No, that won’t do at all,” I said “Not at all? Well, then – this way comes your own satisfaction,” “There is nothing else but to fuck;” he agreed. “Then do it - quickly – and leave me.” His face was serious, and there was no point to argue. I was not going to resist as I lay there, naked, my eyes glued to the thick, thick dark black cock in front of me. “What next – how badly do I want your ass?” There was a pause while he pondered this - my body betraying me. “I want your cock. I want your cock deep inside me.” “You are fucking gorgeous,” he said as he slowly turned and walked into the bedroom as gracefully as if I was a ballerina dancing at a carnival. “Let’s fuck,” he said – he was clearly enjoying our situation as he walked slowly to the bed, his arms going around my body. He lowered me gently to the bed – our naked bodies touching. I had already discarded my clothes when he had come to the bed, the clothes I usually wore to this place. My own cock immediately hardened and made itself apparent, its hardness pointing up against his belly – this man was going to fuck me. I could not believe that he wanted to fuck me - I had come to this place to live so that I might escape. I took the cock in my hand, the rigid hard shaft sliding between my fingers with each step - in and out he slowly fucked himself on, the cock – the cock of the man who had fucked me – with my own cum. I could not believe how good it felt. It had been a long time since a man had made himself feel so good in me - just like this cock. I was about to be raped – again... We kissed with renewed vigour as I felt his lips part, his tongue touch mine, a hand caressing all my skin – exploring all my body, discovering mine. My cock was soon hard - and I was going to give this man what he wanted for life. The kiss got harder and hotter as our cocks rubbed all over each others bodies: I could feel both of us getting so hot that our heads were becoming a little dizzy and my cock was almost painful. His hands were all over my cock and balls - they felt so smooth and so hard. We kissed more furiously for a couple of more minutes – I knew I wouldn’t last long. My balls were going to be pulled off – but I wanted the cock to be completely emptied into me. Then he turned and walked past the bed, his erection pointing straight up. “Don’t you ever give up on you own orgasm, prisoner?” “No,” I agreed. “The real problem is that it is not enough ... I want both of you...” “No, no, that’s not right,” I said. “Not good enough,” he replied.</p> <p>I reached for my clothes but he took them – my clothes on, of course!” I was embarrassed to say that he had just stopped – the shame in it had been real and I think he felt so good touching me. “Do it. Fuck yourself – the same way you fucked me last time,” I said. I kissed him and lay back on the bed. I was not as sure as I could be about this. I felt his finger pushing in from behind to my ass. I said nothing and he kept pressing in – then I felt a finger inside my ass. That finger had not only found my pucker but was caressing my hole – searching out the little nerve-filled places that had me so turned on all this time. I felt his finger inside me – my cock, touching and exploring and prodding and playing with my own finger. His finger felt so different – they were both giving me – to and touching and feeling. each other to—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
