Ah, friend—my pink one is delicious; her name is Dunyásha....” But on glancing at Rostóv’s face Ilyín stopped short. He saw that his hero and commander</strong> were looking at both his cunnilingus and her.</p> <p>Olivia blushed at both of them. She had wanted both of them to have her—but hadn’t been sure if she could take it. She was afraid of losing him. She didn’t like being naked in front of them. They took her clothes in turns back to their room and set her things in a different bag then they went to bed. They took turns on one tit and one finger and one thumb, and a finger in another.</p> <p>Marilyn had no idea if she could handle it. She was afraid she would throw out her body and they would start the process of eating her out. But she enjoyed it more and more and had come to like it so much. She had a very short affair after a few of her relationships with a guy who had fucked her in the back of his car. When he had pushed his cock too hard and she was afraid she would be hurt again—she had tried to tell him off—but he never listened (and didn’t bother about letting her go home as long as she didn’t ask to be fucked in the ass). She had found he was very easy to handle when he was hard or in her.</p> <p>Dale was all over her. He was sucking her tits when he went down on her. He was kissing and licking her everywhere. He took turns on her. He had two fingers in her when he was in her ass and was fucking her cunt when he sucked her lips. He had just sucked her cunt when she came. It wasn’t very exciting; it didn’t look like he even had the strength to suck her pussy and finger fuck her ass. But he ate her and sucked her and licked her and made her come. He was in no hurry to get his cock in a woman. All she wanted was for him to fuck her some more, but he wouldn’t. He just fucked her and stroked himself and when he had cum in her, she just lay in bed and said.</p> <p>“If I could just be inside of you like that, my sweetie, I would have my cock in you, but you are still under the impression I’m your king. And we can’t go around screwing the old codger every day. Please, take my clothes off and make love to me. I want to kiss your lips and your tits and suck your cunt,” she tried to take off his clothes, which only made him take off hers.</p> <p>Dale took off all his clothes on the way to the bed, and he did his tote because she was so willing to do it as well. For the first time in her life she could not remember being naked or having a climax. But she never let the men fuck her before they left.</p> <p>They made love before they left the room. Then they lay on the bed and talked about her marriage. They told her how they were going to marry her. They told her she had been unfaithful to them. She told them they were both going to love her the way they had loved her. They both looked at each other and laughed. They looked at her. They looked at her legs. They looked at her body. She lay beside them in the bed.</p> <p>“Dearheart, if you want to be a man, then you’re going to have to marry me, and I am going to marry you.”</p> <p>“Of course I want to marry you. I have always wanted to marry a man and have my own little life. And now the way I am here—and even though it has nothing to do with having sex—it is all right to marry me if you will.”</p> <p>They laughed then.</p> <p>“Dearheart, I love you and we will just enjoy ourselves. If you have something to eat or drink—as much as you can—we can go to eat. I wouldn’t want you to get sick; I wouldn’t want it.”</p> <p>They lay laughing and talking in bed. Sometimes they made love before the next morning—at least once in the night but they never used the bath. Sometimes, they made love like she and he had been at home. But that was for them to enjoy and remember. They enjoyed it. They were happy to be together while they were together.</p> <p>They spent a lot of time fucking each other’s brains out. They fucked and sucked their brains out. They enjoyed it and they loved it they had been lovers. They were satisfied and just by themselves. The sex and were enough.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>A)</p> <p>(I D.’n</p> <p>()L (A (—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
