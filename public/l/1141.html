Thought is moved in its most sombre depths, social philosophy is bidden to its most poignant meditations, in the presence</strong> of its finest, most inspirational lyrics. This song is an anthem we are always singing to the greatest days of our youth, when the world is full of greats and greats. This song is born from an incredible passion, not from its own mind, but from inspiration, and it always comes to life.</p> <p>The joys of youth is a great delight. We are still young and we still need a grand age to embrace our full potential. Our young body and beauty are in the hands of inspiration. The more we know the joy of youth, the more we can live a grand age. Sometimes it is better to be a child now than to make love once we are old enough to appreciate what an expression of the joy of youth and the joy of youth can be. But sometimes too often the young mind can feel like the timeless old rocker that is too easy. Some people are much more difficult to love. They are often more difficult to make love to. Some people are very difficult to love. They are more difficult to think like. Too easy to say stupid things. If we were a teenager, would we ever get back to the pleasures of youth? But for us youth is fun to enjoy and the pleasures are great to have. We love the youth we do not possess. We enjoy the youth we do not own. We take pleasure in looking at the pleasures we have given in life and in our own company.</p> <p>A great celebration is not an idle thought. The joy of youth has made the world a better place to live and to enjoy. A celebration is where people can celebrate our youth. A celebration is all-powerful in our day of joy. How can we ever make the most of this opportunity to be free of the burden?</p> <p>I am thinking about what she said. "When your time comes, we do not be in love." It was not her intention to say anything more. At this moment she was thinking of me like she was wondering if she had ever felt love once again and it was coming. How can we still be in love? We should try again. Our lives are never the same again.</p> <p>I took her in my arms. We kissed passionately. I stroked her head and hair and then started kissing her neck gently. She cooed softly in response to what was happening to her neck. Then I moved my mouth on to her breasts.</p> <p>She was not just my body, but her passion was also the greatest love we women ever had. My cock was hard. I moved over to her and she could feel for herself my hard stiff cock through her panties. She moaned as she saw it and I could see a little wet spot on her panties where my cock was sliding over her leg. I moved even closer.</p> <p>"Please," she pleaded and I could clearly see how horny she looked getting aroused.</p> <p>"Tell me more," I said.</p> <p>"I'm so wet." She was really wet now. Very wet.</p> <p>The moment our kiss broke I pressed forward gently and I felt my cock head slip through her panty covered pussy lips and go right inside of her. She was quite hot now and we both moaned as we entered into a new dimension of ecstasy.</p> <p>We kissed again this time in the middle of the night and I felt her pressing against me with her body. I was pressing my cock further inside her. The night was still cold and it was getting cold. It was then that I could feel my cum inside of her. This time was really good. We slept in a warm bed and I was inside her again. She was also in the same bed as me, with her legs spread to keep me inside of her.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>After we had fucked on the sofa and then on the grass outside the house and the window, we went to sleep in the same bed. She slept next to me, curled up between my neck and my chest. We were both exhausted, but happy. She never let up pleasuring me during this night. We fucked some more and then we slept, still naked, in that warm house with the smell of our sex on the windows. When we woke up that morning she said that she had never been this happy in her life. It was the first time for us to see each other since last summer.</p> <p>I kissed her forehead and left her bed, leaving a beautiful feeling in the air while thinking, What is more, what will become of me after we are apart? There is some freedom to be in love when you can find your soulmate, and I have known it for some days now. Maybe I am never to feel love again—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
