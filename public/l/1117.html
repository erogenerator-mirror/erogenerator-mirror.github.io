He was already in place, standing there with his back to the wall. He was wearing a pair of light blue boxers and a white shirt. The sleeves from his hands were unbuttoned.</p> <p>As he was about to reach for the door, Javert's arms were around his head and his face was buried in his hands. The look in his eye was the same as those of those he used to do those horrible things to his captives in the old days, when Javert and the other prisoners, from his past, had had their very lives and were finally living it out. His fingers were interlocked with the white shirt, but his hands were on his neck. His fingers seemed to be moving in time with the rhythm of his throat.</p> <p>It was a routine, a process, where Javert could see the white of his shirt and the black of the rest of what he would do when their time together was up. They would be gone. It was only an hour's march, and he would be home and away from the evil, sadistic people, who had all these lives to make, and were ready to destroy the good that had been his.</p> <p>It was also an hour's march, where Javert would have time to enjoy the company of this beautiful young man before he had to be forced to leave.</p> <p>They ran in the opposite direction, and, in his case, Javert had no idea where that's going. But if he was in the right place, the distance was going to be very good.</p> <p>Javert could feel the tears running down his face as he walked, running at his chest. He reached the car a half a street away and slammed it shut. He felt his head being dragged up against the back window.</p> <p>"You were very pretty," Javert said as he leaned against the door and rested his head into his hands.</p> <p>The door was locked. Javert turned his head and looked at the guard who had just pushed the button for the exits, and was about to enter the car.</p> <p>"Can I, can you, do something for me?" Javert spoke with a slight hesitation. He took a deep breath, turned quickly to look out the rear window.</p> <p>"I want to apologize for my rude words. I've been very foolish. Yours looks so much nicer than this."</p> <p>He moved his hands back and forth on his sides, and Javert closed his eyes. He breathed, his head still resting against the metal, and he felt a small, wetness growing between his legs. He smiled slightly, and reached for the door handle. It was locked. Javert reached over and unlocked the door, looked out the window at the black sky. Everything seemed to be calm.</p> <p>At the other end of the car ride, both sides of Javert were looking at each other. He knew that he shouldn't look, but the way they were looking at each other was so perfect together. It was all Javert could do to keep a straight face. The expression of relief and happiness he had known since his capture was more than him and the others had been able to recognize in his face.</p> <p>"It's ok," he said as he leaned closer to Javert.</p> <p>"Thank you," Javert said as he looked into his friends eyes. He felt the tears start to trail down his face as he leaned in again. He put one strong arm on the steering wheel and pulled his head away from Javert to look at the car—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
