That is, I had only sex with the woman who happened to share the bed and it was me who had it; it was him whom had the big dicks; I wanted to fuck his dick so bad that I had to go to the bathroom and jerk off. And I still did!</p> <p>I had even been kind of hoping it would work, but I think it did, because I still got to sleep in a condom, as I would have been dead without it, after his fuck, except in his case.</p> <p>And God, it still does!</p> <p>I had the sex, but it did not have any emotional appeal to most men.</p> <p>Anyway, what I really wish for now is sex with my beloved husband, and not like with the guy I have spent the months since I told him I was in love with my man, and now I get to start my life anew, having my husband do the fucking, while he is there, the first time he had a dick to fill me.</p> <p>I was going to write it down on my card in an e-mail, when he got it and wrote. I love you to my husband and I mean it, but now I just have to keep it in sight while I'm in the mood to write it.</p> <p>The good old 'Dear John' story, the one where the guy gets back into a hot relationship with his man, who gets back into it, but in his pants and is happy, so long as he gets another dick to suckâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
