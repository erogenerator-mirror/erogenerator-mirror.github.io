When any shall either impeach thee with false accusations, or</h4><p><strong>hatefully reproach thee, or shall use any such carriage towards thee, get thee presently to their minds and understandings, and look in them, and behold what manner of men they</strong> are, whether thou be them men, or as thou be in the sight of God, or even God Himself, and what thou hast heard hath told ye well how thou shall see God in Thy eyes, and how thou shall enjoy seeing heaven, and what hath been told you what thou shall now see in thy eyes: the eyes that see heaven, the eyes that see heaven?"</p> <p>"Yes." she said. "And so thee said?" He said.</p> <p>'Thy eyes see heaven'" she said. She said it again, in a voice far, far apart from the voice of man, but clearly audible from her.</p> <p>'Yes, and with all God's wisdom, thou may see thou shalt be blessed by heaven, and shalt be the love of thy God and thy friend, and the God of God!' he said.</p> <p>"And that is how I shall be." She said. "And this is how God shall be!"</p> <p>"Yes." He said. "Yes, this is how God shall be."</p> <p>He lay down beside her, and began kissing her mouth: she responded. She kissed him back. She went to his chest and gently touched his nipples through his clothes. He lay down beside her, and his arm went over her. One hand went to her breasts, cupped them, and pressed them, and played with the nipples.</p> <p>She began to kiss him there. "I do not mind." she said. "In fact, I think I am in favour."</p> <p>He said nothing. He pulled from her and lifted her shirt, then the buttons, and the bra and opened her legs. He was already looking closely at her, and thought he saw the most beautiful pussy, or the most gorgeous cunt he'd seen, but he didn't care. She was completely naked. He pulled her down, and lay on top of her, and kissed her, and she kissed him back. He put his hands on her tits, squeezed and fondled them, and kissed her neck.</p> <p>Soon he was rubbing her pussy. She was soaking wet. She didn't mean to be this way, or even to kiss him, but he kept coming back to her.</p> <p>"Ohhh" she moaned, "ohhhh yes, ohhhh yes." She began to get louder, and he knew she was about to come. She was about to come so hard. She moaned. She moaned, and gasped, and came. There was nothing she could say that she couldn't say to him, she said: 'I wish there was no god in thy eyes, for Thou hast seen thyself, and thee know not who thou wolost is, and who thou art thou: Ah, yes, yes, yes. Fuck, yes, fuck, yes.'</p> <p>He got off of her, and got off the bed. He stood up, and walked toward the front room.</p> <p>"Here is the best part." she said. "We shall wait, but now the real fun begins. Let us wait, before thy eyes! Let us go."</p> <p>(to be continued.)â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
