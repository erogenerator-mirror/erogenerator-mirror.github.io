It was our parents, who were not able to afford to provide the sort of luxuries and amenities of a society like ours to spare. The house was in a mess. Everything in it was ruined and dirty. My father was not the only man in the house, there were several other men, and only a few people. Some were with a man or a man alone. Most were still asleep in various rooms in the house.</p> <p>One man I recognised from my childhood came to my door one night after the two men went to sleep. He went to the bedroom and changed. He was dressed in his pyjamas. It was him that came to my door.</p> <p>I knew it was him, but I did not ask him. 'Wake up honey.' I was still asleep. His hand was on my thigh. It was not the first time I felt it between my legs. But I was still in the nude.</p> <p>His mouth was at my breasts. It felt strange to be awakened by his mouth on my breasts, but in an erotic way.</p> <p>It was not the first time I felt him playing my body.</p> <p>But this time it was different. He was still in his pyjamas and he was moving his body up and down. His penis moved up and down between the lips of my vagina.</p> <p>It felt different than a man's penis. It moved up and down in my vagina.</p> <p>It moved up and down faster. Every so often he stopped to breathe for a few seconds, then the penis moved back down, moving faster again.</p> <p>It was not the first time he had sucked my breasts. He had sucked the others a few times before; but this time, this time they just lay there in pleasure, still breathing.</p> <p>They both looked down at me, then the fingers started to move up and down their dicks. I moved my legs a little. I was very open and I could see how wet their cocks were. I closed my legs and stretched them. They were fully erect in front of my eye.</p> <p>I saw the foreskin moved back. What a sight, a man's penis had pulled out and moved between my legs.</p> <p>The foreskin moved back and forward.</p> <p>He had his hand at the base of his shaft now and pushed his thumb and forefinger at my vagina. They were moving both of them around inside the pink fleshy lips of my vagina now.</p> <p>'Put some jelly on me, you'll make me horny darling.' I was moving down from my bed. I was lying on the carpet, legs wide apart, lying on the bathroom-type toilet.</p> <p>I watched him move his hand to his penis. He started to rub it against my pussy lips. He started by putting his finger on my clitoris. Slowly he started pressing the area of his erection against my vaginal opening. Then with a deep push, he pushed the whole head inside me.</p> <p>He pushed it in a little deeper each time, moving it in and out of my hole and my vagina. Then he came with a sigh and lay it on me.</p> <p>I raised my legs and moved a little. This time he pushed the whole thing inside me. I tried to move my legs. I did not want to wake him up.</p> <p>He started to move it around in my vagina faster. Soon I was enjoying it. I was moaning more and more. Then I pushed his hand away. Instead he moved his penis inside me. He had some other part that he held in his own hands. He moved the whole shaft around some more.</p> <p>I raised my feet. They must have been touching my thighs. They were moving up and down.</p> <p>'You should take off your pyjamas, you will show the man your vagina' I shouted to myself.</p> <p>I slowly raised my body. My legs were still on the floor and I moved them apart, opening myself up.</p> <p>'There there love. Just the head is still inside me. Now go.'</p> <p>I opened myself up.</p> <p>He lifted himself to his knees and pushed the entire penis inside my vagina.</p> <p>'Just fuck the inside, love.' I told him.</p> <p>He started again to move his hips. My legs. . I raised my body upwards, and he kept going, in and he pulled the penis out with his hands. at its movements... which made him.
