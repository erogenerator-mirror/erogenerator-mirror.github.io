He wanted to fuck with the man.</p> <p>This thought brought him to that critical end. The man's word, and his Word, were his only weapons. He knew that he was capable. The man could not fuck with the man.</p> <p>He wanted to fuck.</p> <p>"A-h!" That was enough. The man came into his arms. The man's cock, for all of his strength and lust and desire, entered his consciousness. It was hard. It was so hard. It had grown hard. It had grown so hard, because it was in so much the same state as his organ: hard, but in a decent way. Very nice! He'd like to fuck!</p> <p>But it was not necessary. He knew. He knew that the man was not a man. If he liked fucking, he could use his tool. This man.</p> <p>The big, hard cock was deep in his throat. The man was deep in his throat. The man was sucking on his tool with deep hunger. All of it!</p> <p>There was no doubt in his brain that the man was not a man; rather, it was an appendage, a tool. He was a tool in the face of which the man was being used. The tool being used to fuck the man. Which meant that the penis was not a man. It was not a man, and was not a body. It was a penis.</p> <p>The man was enjoying the feel of the mouth on his throbbing erection.</p> <p>It was not a physical act. More of a sexual act, something like this. It was more of a sexual act. It felt good, really good, to have the mouth on him. It felt dirty to be doing the things that made him feel so turned on by the pleasure of his cock being sucked and fucked, and, when he was fucked, it felt good. It felt good to have his mouth on his cock, for the man to enjoy it all.</p> <p>The man was moaning to the feel of the man's cock in his mouth. He was moaning, too. His body was going in and out. Every stroke was stimulating, stimulating, exciting. He was in heat. He was in lust, which he was feeling all the time. He was in anticipation of being fucked by a man. He was in orgasm.</p> <p>The cock was in him.</p> <p>The man was in a state that would make a man ejaculate his whole load into the penis.</p> <p>It started in his ass.</p> <p>The man's fingers were in his own ass. The fingers were in his ass. It felt good. The finger in his ass was in the anus. The finger was in the anus of a man. It was in the anus of a man.</p> <p>The cock was in his ass.</p> <p>It started slowly. It worked itself into the anus. It worked its way slowly and carefully into and out of the anus. It worked the ass off to the point that it had an unpleasant feeling, but the man was not in pain. He was in full pleasure. The man was fucking the ass of a man in the ass. It, too, was in pleasure.</p> <p>The man's body, which could use it; was in heat. His body was moving in that rhythm. He was fucking the cock in his ass and the body in the ass was going in rhythm and rhythm.</p> <p>That's how the cock would feel in every hole and in every part and a rhythm had been created. The man's ass was giving itself to his cock. His ass was giving itself to his cock. The cock in his ass could feel and experience everything that was in this ass; the feelings of man's hot skin, the heat of his body, the hardness of the man's body; the hardness of the cock. The man could feel everything, except the cock and the cock knew that it was in his ass, and the cock knew that the ass could not fuck itself on it. It could have had an orgasm, it could have had a massive one, but the ass, the asshole, the prostate was being fucked.</p> <p>'Jesus, Jesus,' He said for the man's ass couldn't fuck itself on that cock. His cock was in there with the cock fucking a man's ass. He could have an orgasm, he could have a massive orgasm, but the asshole couldn't fuck itself on the cock. It felt fine!</p> <p>The mouth on the cock was moving with him. It was fucking his ass with the cock. It was fucking the ass of a man to make it fuck itself on the cock. The ass was fucking.</p> <p></p> <p>"The man was in heat in heat.</p> <p>The man fucked in love. the ass in lust. the man loved. the man was in lust.</p> <p>the man lovedâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
