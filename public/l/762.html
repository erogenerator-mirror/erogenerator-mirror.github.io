Rowland left home leaving no address, nor any other indication of what he</strong> had on; she only knew that it was a good thing.</p> <p>Rowland felt his body as though she were dancing, he felt her breath on him, she had him, he could feel the warmth of her skin burning his own as the light of the candles shone on his body. He kissed her, she opened herself to him and he felt himself grow. They made love. He felt his world fade. Her kisses were sweet, he felt her body against his, a soft breath and a soft whimper on his lips as she felt him press against her.</p> <p>He felt her body as if it was burning into his mind and could not say a word. He wondered whether she was imagining it or if she was trying.</p> <p>"No, Rowlyn," he pulled back from her mouth. "I'm sorry." His mind was clouded by despair. How had she felt? He had made love to her, she had liked it.</p> <p>The answer to his question was to make love to her, but what did that mean?</p> <p>He turned her around so that they remained on the spot as he sat on the rug. Once she was standing against the table top, he grabbed her around her waist and lowered her to the floor as he kissed her bellybutton, sucking it into his mouth and kissing its soft flesh while his hands caressed the cheeks of her ass. He kissed around her navel, feeling its softness under his fingers, and down her bellybutton on its way, feeling her skin quiver along his fingers when his fingers parted her tight jeans and his palms cupped her ass as she bent over the table, wanting him. Rowlyn felt dizzy, her heart hammered in her belly as he removed her jeans, exposing her long, thick legs, all the way to her ankle and the high, white legs hanging limp from the side of the table as if they were never going to budge, their only protection at all.</p> <p>Rowlyn felt his fingers spreading her wide and felt his body touch hers as he kissed her deeply. She felt as if she had been dipped into the liquid center of her sex, the warmth of his face caressing her, making her feel at once that she truly belonged to him, that she was the woman he felt a man should love her. She had no idea how good it felt to have him as her master.</p> <p>She felt his manhood press against her sex as he bent her lower by her thighs and his hands continued teasing the skin underneath her, pulling her onto her knees before him, his cock in his hand. He kissed the insides of her thighs as his breath was ragged in her ears as he ran his hands on her ass, squeezing and feeling her round cheeks with trembling fingers. She felt so warm as his body pressed against her and he slid his fingers into her sex, caressing her lips, and slipping them into her body with his thumb as he pressed against her and she felt so soft in his hands.</p> <p>His fingers made her body warm with warmth as he rubbed against them, and Rowlyn felt this warmth spread between her legs, spreading along every inch of her as if she was a living thing.</p> <p>Rowlyn felt him press, her body tensed as he slipped her panties down her legs, the cool air against her naked skin as she took in her scent, the way the soft fabric felt against her skin. She felt her heart quicken as his fingers slipped into her as she turned about and saw his face as he leaned against her knees, kissing her thigh as he knelt so she could feel his tongue lick between her legs as his breath warmed her thighs.</p> <p>She felt as if she was on fire and that feeling only increased as his tongue worked its way gently from her sex to her clitoris. She felt it being licked as she shivered, feeling a trickle of wetness run down her thigh as his mouth enveloped her whole, drinking from her love, tasting her, devouring her, sucking her lips until she felt a sharp pain in her belly. He felt her tremble, feeling those sensations deep inside of her but not letting her touch it as his fingers teased her and brought pleasure to her in a way that she could not imagine.</p> <p>In his world she was only the receptacle of his love and this thought made her orgasm. She felt the wetness inside her, the feeling of his body against hers, as her entire being was wrapped around him, his fingers and his tongue, his hands and his face.</p> <p>"Rowlyn!"</p> <p>Her name was not her name and she could not tell whose voice it was. She felt his hands in her own as they caressed her, the cheeks, and and with his mouth as he kissed her. the length of her lips, his face, as if she moaned. , as her. She felt his weight and to him as he filled in his lips, as her—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
