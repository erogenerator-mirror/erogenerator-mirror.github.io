The Apostles in our Saviours</strong>' birthdays are now a couple, and as a couple we will remain close as close as possible to each other.</p> <p>On this last year and a few days, the Creator gave us those words, "Remember that love will come over you in some manner, that you are the Creator and he is your Savior and You are the Creator. You will love each other and be as your Savior will always be."</p> <p>A few more days passed, and then we had our night together. We ate and went to bed. We fell asleep at the side of the bed.</p> <p>When we woke up, it was about eight. It was getting darker. "Let's take a bath," she said. I thought it was just a good idea since she would have to wash off her robe, and get dressed again in the morning. While I was in the bath, she joined me in the bathroom. We got out of the tub, dried ourselves off, and went into the bedroom.</p> <p>She sat on the bed with her legs spread apart. At first I was just concerned about her looking at me naked, but when I moved closer she reached down and grabbed my dick in the middle. I felt her fingers run under the head and rub it lightly, then she started stroking it. The feeling was wonderful, and she kept stroking me longer and harder. It was hard to believe, but it wasn't a dream at all. I think my climaxes that morning would be enough for a couple, and that night wouldn't even be a dream.</p> <p>I came in her hand, and she held on to me until my prick got hard again. I washed her body, taking my time. I got her robe back on, and we got dressed again. We went downstairs to breakfast. We spent a few minutes making a lot of friends on our way to the buffet to have breakfast. After having the lunch conversation, we got dressed and she took the basket from me.</p> <p>"We'll be back at your place for lunch," she said. "We're having a special picnic today, and I really hope you're hungry again because I've got a surprise for you." We went to the restaurant for two hours and then headed back home. We decided not to go to the park, she promised, but I know she didn't mean it. Instead, we took a walk to the park. There was a tree, where we had been sitting and talking.</p> <p>It was beautiful. It was warm, so we stripped off our clothes, and walked along the tree to find it. We sat around for a while and talked. We stopped and ate lunch, and then I offered her the basket for our picnic.</p> <p>"What am I wearing today?" she asked.</p> <p>"What kind of picnic?" I asked.</p> <p>"Do I need to choose?"</p> <p>"No, I already know what to wear, since you asked." As I spread the blanket out on the ground, she had me take out my cock from my shorts. I looked at it and then over at her. Her nipples were standing straight up, and she was looking at it. It felt wonderful. I moved around to her and we got into a 69 position. I kissed her and she sucked on me for a while. Her pussy was wet and ready for me. I slipped in. We worked together to take all of me. She came quickly. It really did feel very good. She went on her back and I was sucking on her nipples. I got a little later than I wanted to, because that's all I could.</p> <p>We got up and went to bed, but we stayed in for a few hours. We decided that a nice round of orgasms is necessary while we're still naked. And our lovemaking wasn't too bad either, either in the way I was fucking her or in the way I was fucking her when I was ready to burst.</p> <p>We slept late. I had some early classes that week, and we had dinner together before going on the picnic. We had been at it pretty well for the last week, but still, the orgasms were pretty good. We finished our meal, got dressed back at the house and left for the park. We had sex that day again, in our usual way, in her van. She was still naked (but I knew better than to put on lingerie for her). I fucked her several times before we both came again.</p> <p>We went to our favorite picnic. When we got there, we sat down and ate and ate some more. I came again in her vagina and we both had our orgasms. It felt wonderful. We also drank lots of water, which felt very good. We sat close to the woods and talked and talked some more and made love. She asked some of our lives we had seen, and talked to some more of our lives we said too. It had to do things we had.
