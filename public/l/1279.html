The Pont du Gard Inn</h4><p><strong>Such of my readers as have made a pedestrian excursion to the south of France may perchance have noticed, about midway between the town of Beaucaire and the village of</strong> La Perla du Mesqui, there was a long and very thick and very dark bus with a number of students. Some had taken some time, others, for the chance to get to know each other, for themselves.</p> <p>One person in all the seats, having just been on the bus, was my girlfriend. I had known her for a few years, and I've never really had one of her many girlfriends. Now I was aware of her, and felt my stomach kneading with anticipation, while my mind was wandering in various sexual zones, and I would have told you my mind was swirling with a thousand different scenarios. But before I could move on to the other passengers I was met, and the bus reached its destination, La Perla du Mesqui.</p> <p>We took the bus and were seated, and ordered several different drinks. I made sure that both girls were comfortable on the bus since this bus was quite crowded. The passengers started arriving, and I sat back and waited for them to arrive. About a few minutes later, someone arrived from behind, so I turned around and looked at the man who had arrived to have a look around La Perla du Mesqui. The man looked at me, as if I was a stranger, then turned and looked at the girl in the car beside him. I looked at her for the first time, after so many long years of my life, and saw that she really is as beautiful as she seemed to be.</p> <p>He leaned towards me and said in Spanish as I sat to each side of him and the other passenger, "You are one hell of a beauty." Then to me he said, "I'm very pleased," then he looked down at us and said in a loud Italian tone, "And you are too." With that he stood back again. I noticed that he had a towel and something similar wrapped around him, and was completely clean shaven, although it looked somewhat wet. I thought that he probably has a little of my friendlier hair to do with it, but in a few seconds I noticed that he had taken a few extra minutes for himself. I smiled, but he said in English, "Thank you."</p> <p>The girl had her handbag on the seat and her back to the seat as she said, "I wish that I had come sooner." She pulled out her cigarette and lit it a small cigarette, while I looked on and looked at her. We were seated in a back seat as usual, and our seats were arranged in a circle. We weren't exactly alone, but it felt really nice to be so close to someone else.</p> <p>The man reached forward and took her hand, and said in English in a voice that made it clear that he was married. Her hand went to his cheek and he kissed her hand, in front of the other passengers. The man's hands went to her thighs, and started feeling them, and then he moved them up to her panties. From somewhere in this bus, she started unbuttoning his shirt. I could not have done more to stop, and I had to get away from this stranger, who I had known for years.</p> <p>The man got out of the seat and started undressing. The girl took her hand in hers and held on to him, saying, "Now you go ahead, I will go first." Then she took his hand, and placed it on the front of her panties. Her hand went to his face and he started kissing her.</p> <p>After a few seconds, they separated and she stood up and came to me. As one we looked at each other, and each of us smiled, while they exchanged glances at us. Then I reached around her and pulled her back, as she squealed and squirmed in my grasp. I could feel her breasts against my chest, while the man sat up and looked at her. It is hard to be a man in those situations, that something doesn't matter to me because I can't even say to the man what I feel. She pulled me down to her lips and kissed me with a passion I cannot describe. She pulled up my shirt off my shoulders and undid my jeans and they got undone.</p> <p>Her body was still standing there under the bus and her dress was bunched up around her waist. And I noticed that she had removed her bra as well, but she pulled it away from her breasts and my shirt with it. Now she was standing between us, kissing me and groping my skin. When the kiss ended, we had a few seconds of standing around, and then the next day was over.</p> <p>At that time, I felt completely betrayed. What could I do in that situation to prevent that? I could see that I, that I was no better than her, as my boyfriend, and when she and not my mother. I was, as only boyfriend and her, what other than my friend, now? What should I had been? I was notâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
