Out of Antisthenes. ’It is a princely thing to do well, and to be</h4><p><strong>ill-spoken of. It is a shameful thing that the face should be subject unto the mind, to be put into what shape it will, and to be dressed by it</strong>. But even as that may be seen in your face by it, my own will of will be put on you.</p> <p>*</p> <p>The day came. It all began on the morning of the 21st, the day when I had arrived in New York, for I had been looking forward to my appointment. I had been anxious, not because I didn't get a chance to see a lot of my clients at all, but because it was the day after their 21st.</p> <p>I got up early in the morning, taking my usual morning jog. No other work I had to do that day, and I did not want to leave the office. However, that didn't bother me, and with a few last minute breaks, I returned to my bedroom. As I walked into the master bedroom, I noted that the door was closed, and I heard several other people bustling about. The room I was in was a mess. The sheets were completely disheveled, and even though it smelled of bedding, I knew the smell of cum and pussy. I had to go into the bathroom, where the toilet was, flush it out and wash my hands and face before returning to the bedroom.</p> <p>On the pillow in the corner, with my face in the center, was the body of my wife, who was laying on the bed, with her legs spread wide apart, her pussy being stuffed by a black guy. She was sucking a guy's dick. Not a big deal, but it still took about five minutes after he came into her to feel and see how she was doing. On her other side was Joe. He was fucking that girl from behind, with a long, wet, slow, sloppy, rhythmic fuck.</p> <p>I got undressed, and went to wash up, in the corner. I couldn't help but smell the hot wetness between her legs, and to feel the musky smell of her sex. I couldn't help but smell even more of the aroma of her pussy, which was all around me. Then, without even thinking about what I was doing, I began gently feeling for myself, feeling her body with only a touch of the towel. I was really aroused when I felt her breasts, and even when I reached her cunt, it did not enter my mind that she had a cock.</p> <p>When finally I saw it, I took it as far into my mouth as I could. Even that much cock taste was not that much different to the taste that I got from my wife's pussy, and that was all it needed to make me want to fuck her.</p> <p>I was on my back, still lying on top of her, when I felt her hands go around me, gripping my butt cheeks, pulling me deep into her, almost pulling me out before plunging back in. As I felt her body stiffen, and with a loud grunt, I felt her spasm, followed by a gush of her love juice all over my face.</p> <p>I wasn't going to let her stop. I wanted her to get off. So, all I could say was: "I want you to take my ass," as I pulled her over the side of the bed, got on my knees, and thrust my cock up her ass. With that, her body went limp and I was able to pull out of her asshole, with a plop. Without being able to see her, I could only assume she was still cumming. With that much cum in her pussy, I got up and stood, then pushed my cock up between her legs, again.</p> <p>When I started feeling for her cunt, I decided to wait for a second, hoping that she wouldn't cum immediately. But, within five seconds, she had cum. I was about to have it again, again, when I felt a hand reaching down between her legs, and as I looked over, I saw it was her. We both were cumming. My cock didn't go out, and she still had its full length out of her ass, as her pussy continued to spasm.</p> <p>I heard the other two voices saying "fuck, fuck, fuck," and when they saw me looking at her, they stopped in their tracks. We all looked at each other, as we both came to our senses and tried to move.</p> <p>"It was a great job, I'm sure we will be able to do it again sometime, you know, after this morning," Joe said.</p> <p>"Don't think so, Joe. It is my birthday, but I can't have my husband fucking me," I said to myself.</p> <p>I went into her bathroom, and got a towel and some lubricant, and started preparing her vagina, trying to remove the smell of sperm and pussy. Then, after the fingers to remove both our own cum, I went out of hers, and our genitals, and brought out again and both our genitals.</p> <p></p> <p>for the dick and the balls—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
