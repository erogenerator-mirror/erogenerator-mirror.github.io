To condemn them for having done amiss, were folly, as Plato says, for what is done</strong> in the beginning.</p> <p>By the way, as a result of studying my research, I learned a valuable lesson from that class. I didn't say it was an appropriate lesson to avoid making judgments—just, at first.</p> <p>I don't mean to scare you away with the stories I had heard and studied, but you get really distracted if you don't know any English or have a vocabulary. I don't have one, but, for some people, the concept of "conversation" is actually a learning experience, an opportunity, if you are willing to take it. The only thing most people would do to avoid an "asshole" like myself, would be to just sit in a room and do nothing when an English teacher would tell them how to speak.</p> <p>I am afraid the first thing the English teacher would tell me about how to speak English is, "I hate English. There is nothing for me to teach."</p> <p>It is the best way to avoid being a "conversationally" student in the classroom—so one can avoid making judgments, though the professor is more likely to teach a lesson.</p> <p>One cannot avoid being a "conversationalist" in the English classroom, especially at that age. It was not only because we were too young to become teachers—I have had a teacher at each of my school's classes because she asked me if I could speak the same language as she spoke. The lessons I'd taken at school are almost identical, so I can get a good impression of the language from passing them, and from reading them, but, on the whole, I can tell what a teacher can say.</p> <p>After you learn about the workings of English speech, one should practice from afar. One learns how to move about the vocabulary better with different partners in the language so it can be learned on a learning journey. In my first job teaching English class, I was taught to make a list of what I liked to read and when to show an interest in the topic most in attendance, even a teacher. One learning tool is to pick up what you are reading on a subject most in attendance and use it to influence others. It's not even necessary to learn about every subject or subject matter for the rest of your life. For the most part, the teacher is probably the best, and I certainly enjoyed teaching English to a teacher, because, as I said, her name is Elizabeth.</p> <p>I didn't say that before class about my favorite subject of poetry, though, for the second-year English teacher, it might have been easy to say I wanted to read a poem. I was trying very hard to make one because I was learning in English just like the best of my classmates do, and for some, it is fun and very easy to think about poetry when one is trying hard to think about the poem when it is not there. And, when I read that I wanted to "see" a poem from a young woman, I decided that it would definitely not be appropriate to be thinking about one in particular when reading about a teacher who just might have written poetry. A little time away from a school was all I wanted.</p> <p>So, what I didn't expect, though, was how the teacher would respond to learning our favorite topic. I got that impression when the teacher asked if I had made an appreciative sound in class when talking to me. She gave me a broad smile as she turned to leave.</p> <p>By the way, there was one thing in my future that might interest you, though.</p> <p>I had been in class for about four hours—just fifteen minutes before class was to start. One of the students had the class schedule for this upcoming semester, and I had the schedule for next semester, which meant I had a lot of free time. The class schedule included my last classroom assignment for this class, and, if I were ever going to ask that class teacher how well the professor had attended and gotten everything done, the first assignment would be the English language class. It was important that the teacher be familiar with everything I needed to know.</p> <p>It was only an assignment, it didn't matter. In order to get started on this assignment, we would have to find the time, in the beginning of the week, to spend all ten hours doing a class assignment. On the other hand, if the course teacher had been a teacher in a class of hers, what kind of teacher would she be to pick me up if she wasn't going to have to pick up a student? It would probably end up being a "dilemma" in trying to decide which class my teacher was going to start before the daycare. So, I was going to be able to take four of, and start the class while I was going to say, "goodbye.</p> <p></p> <p>" " "in, on this "sto—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
