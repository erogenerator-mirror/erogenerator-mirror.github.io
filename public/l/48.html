His family knew</strong> he was leaving for Europe somewhere. They decided he was too busy to come home. That was their parting speech.</p> <p>"I'm so sorry mom."</p> <p>"Well, it's been nice talking with you Mr. Bennet. You've improved at school really. If that thing you've been doing has been any better. We all have had some great luck these past few years."</p> <p>"Thanks Mom."</p> <p>Mr. Bennet's heart was beating fast. He loved the idea that anyone could tell if they met him. So many girls would fall in love with his big strong handsome body and that was enough to get them into bed. His family made him feel better and not bad. They knew he loved being single, just with the guys. He and his buddies were doing fine. After what they did for him recently, at least he would look good. His friends wanted him to work out regularly.</p> <p>"Well, Mr. Bennet, you've made me so happy."</p> <p>"Really mom. And how's our sex life lately?"</p> <p>"Pretty good, I haven't lasted as long as I used to. I'm still waiting for Daddy."</p> <p>"Well, we'll see about that, won't we."</p> <p>Mr. Bennet thought about his wife. How do I act around other men? How long, how am I prepared to get a guy who will be okay with taking care of that pussy? Maybe we should wait until our anniversary. The sex of his life is always great for me. Mr. Bennet has seen pictures and videos of a guy being fucked by a bunch of boys. And he's always been a horny guy.</p> <p>"Hey, Mr. Bennet, I think we should get back to work. It's Sunday now, after all."</p> <p>"That's right. We're all coming home now. What are we going to do?"</p> <p>"Well. I guess we should go back to my room."</p> <p>"You really want to watch me being fucked by all these boys?"</p> <p>"Uh..uh. That looks more like fun."</p> <p>"Well. I'll bet you guys will want to watch me getting fucked by all these big hunky guys. Would you like to see me getting fucked by all those big studs, while I'm being fucked by all these boys?"</p> <p>"I'm kinda jealous of you my dear."</p> <p>"I bet it would look good to watch you getting fucked by all those men in the back room by all those big studs."</p> <p>I was hoping she would tell him. I've got to talk to her. Maybe I just have to let him know how much they have in common. But I know how she felt. It was her idea to have sex while she was being fucked by those guys. I think I'm starting to understand why she chose to go out with them. I mean, all these guys wanted a piece of her and she was going along with them. She was so sexy and he was so big.</p> <p>So I didn't want my dad to think anymore of me and I wasn't really into any of that. But after hearing her talk about having sex and all the girls I knew she could tell I wasn't going to help. Mom was telling me exactly the same thing now. They were going to be home for Christmas. Dad would be gone until the next week. He would have a few days where they could really be alone.</p> <p>I had to admit that I wasn't too happy about my father leaving. I had my hand on my knee. Just when I was about to tell him that I was in love with him, I felt the weight of his bad attitude. As soon as our family got home, he would tell me everything was fine again and I would just go straight to bed.</p> <p>The next day, the girls got to our school at about eleven. I had to go for an important medical exam, especially with mom in the middle. I decided to take a drive to the doctors' office, but the professor said he hadn't had much of a lecture in front of his patients for some time, so I wasn't that surprised. As I was driving out to the office, I decided to call in sick and told the school principal I would be out.</p> <p>The doctor was a really good doctor. He had some experience too. He said they couldn't quite treat a problem like an erection. I really don't want him to think about that because there was something else in it.</p> <p>"How late are you having this morning, sir?"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah. Well it seems like the day is finally here to begin."</p> <p>"Well it should be soon, if you haven't got to have the money that. The sooner I won't you can have it then."</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>" Wellâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
