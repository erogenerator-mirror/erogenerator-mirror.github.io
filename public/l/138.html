An Opinion</h4><p><strong>Worn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post. On the tenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun into the</strong> room. Suddenly, the light changed. In his sleep he saw a beautiful, naked women sitting on a bed; on the bed there was a girl as beautiful as her name, an angel. In their eyes, the angel was naked. Her long hair was in a soft veil over her shoulder, her face radiant and mysterious. He looked her up and down. She was almost beautiful. Her breasts stood proudly from her chest, her stomach flat and toned, her legs long and lean from living in rural Iowa. Her black hair fell over her face, framing her full, angelic face. She had an exotic face, with wide eyelashes and deep, blue eyes. She was beautiful.</p> <p>Mr. Lorry was overwhelmed, his cock pulsed and began throbbing in its confines. She made no reply. He looked at her again, with his hungry eyes. He was hypnotized. He was spellbound. He had to feel her. He had to touch her. He was crazy. The world had changed forever. He never thought he would. What was his chance? What could he do? How did he possibly tell his wife what he saw in the darkness above his head? The world seemed to go on forever.</p> <p>'What was it?' he wondered. What was it like to know you are about to make love to a beautiful woman? What is it like to have your sweet wife toying herself upon?</p> <p>But then it happened. Mr. Lorry felt paralyzed. There was an intense electricity that shot through his brain as he felt her body's body, the silky smoothness of her skin, the smoothness of her silky black hair. She was beautiful. Mr. Lorry saw her smile as she sat upon the chair next to his bed. She stood up and looked around her; she took off her glasses and looked at him and then returned to her perky young tits; her nipples hardened like tiny pebbles as she took off her gown. Her skin was silky and white; the skin tone so flawless that it accentuated her features.</p> <p>Mr. Lorry gazed upon her. She was wearing a sheer white negligee, its neckline plunged below her breasts, which were in their entirety exposed, with a single thin strap on the left side. Mr. Lorry was mesmerized and she was making the most beautiful baby face he had ever been in. Her eyes, which seemed to glow with an inner light, were beautiful. He was transfixed. The look in her eyes was a combination of innocence and lust.</p> <p>He reached out his hand and cupped her breast. Her breasts were full in his hand, full and firm. Her skin felt soft. He pulled her closer and then lowered his mouth upon her hardened nipple. She jumped, her body shuddered as her nipples hardened. He licked it. His mouth caressed it. He suckled it. His tongue ran over it, his lips sucked upon it. He flicked her nipple with his tongue. She moaned in a soft and sexy voice, she began to wriggle in bed. He licked her nipple. She made no noise. She moaned. He was crazy. He wanted to fuck her. He wanted to touch her. He was crazy.</p> <p>Mr. Lorry licked her nipple. He took it into his mouth, it felt so good in his mouth, he sucked it in. Her breathing sped up and her nipples became so hard that they became red hot against his mouth. Her breathing became more rapid.</p> <p>He licked her nipple again. He sucked her nipple at the same time as he sucked it. His teeth grazed her nipple. She was gasping. She was moaning again. He could feel her. He felt her. He could hear her. And he could see her. He looked at her. He stared at her. He saw the most wonderful features. Her eyes were hypnotist: dark blue eyes, full of lust and passion, her mouth was full and inviting, and she had the face you would associate with "sir", which is the word: sexy and seductive. His eyes took in the sight of her. In front of him, he could see the inner beauty, her soft, angelic face was made of pure innocence. There was a sense of innocence that he would never forget. His eyes watched her face, which had always reminded him of her.</p> <p>She began pushing her breasts towards his mouth. Her fingers moved to his head. He resisted, as did she. He sucked her nipple. His tongue licked the end of it. Her hand moved away from his head, allowing him to take in her breasts. Mr. Lorry sucked on her. But it was like it became hard. He loved the feel it. He loved the beauty.</p> <p></p> <p>He watched her eyes closed in her face. The look down and it was beautiful.
