There was not one but was ready to follow when he led the way. He did not</strong> say anything at all, just started undressing. I undressed too, and we kissed again, only this time not a peck on the lips. I took off my boxers, and she did too. She took off her blouse and skirt and I watched her with unbridled appreciation at her body. Her breasts were perky, perky, perfect and her skin seemed to come from the ocean. Her pussy hair was silky and soft and perfect, and her pussy lips looked to be just the right size or just the right shape to be kissed. I was tempted to fuck her, and I was not the least bit tempted, but I decided to wait.</p> <p>I lay on my back on the bed and she mounted me. She looked fantastic with her short blonde hair hanging down over her shoulders. Her boobs were large and proud and her nipples were hard. They stood out against her chest, and her nipples were pointing straight up into the air. I reached out for them and she leaned down and took them in her mouth, sucking on them, pulling on them gently until they stood out even more, and then she stood up and reached up and caressed them, and she squeezed herself a bit. I didn't need encouragement and joined her in pleasuring her boobs, paying attention to her nips in the way that I did to hers. She was moaning and breathing very heavily and her eyes were open now, watching me, drinking in everything. When her boobs were nice and tight she put her hands behind her head and I caressed her tits, as she liked it. I kissed the tip of one nipple, and she moaned. I licked the other one, and she moaned. I put my hands behind her head and pulled her towards me and kissed her.</p> <p>She kissed me as she began to ride me with vig, her pussy sliding up and down on mine. We were both wet, but there were no panties to be found: the first time I had ever seen her bare pussy bare, the first time we were going to do it, the first time we had even tried this. I caressed her breasts while I kissed them, her belly, her nipples, feeling them, touching her skin under their skin. Then I moved my hands so I could fondle her naked body as I fucked her. I kissed her, I looked at her, I kissed her, I kissed those soft lips so many times before. I touched her everywhere but her sex, and I caressed her everywhere else, caressing her legs, her belly, her boobs, her thighs, her buttocks, squeezing her pussy so hard I thought it might fall off. She had an orgasm with her pussy touching my cock so hard I thought it would be the end of my life.</p> <p>"I want you inside me!" she whimpered. "I want you inside me! I haven't been touched by anyone else in a week and I want it now" With that she put her legs on my shoulders, raised herself onto my cock so I could enter her again. I kissed her breasts while she fucked me, caressing them and kissing her nipples, and at the same time she was fucking me, fucking me until I was going to cum. I kissed her, and I sucked her nipples and then she kissed me, and her mouth was so hot and wet I felt my orgasm starting. I fucked her harder and faster and she began to moan into my mouth again. Our faces were so close and our tongues touched at the beginning of our mutual orgasm. Finally she kissed me, and she kissed me again, but this time I tasted my cum inside her and I felt how wet she was. We kissed again, and she took my face to kiss my cheek and my lips. Then she put her fingers over my mouth and parted my lips and we kissed again. Her mouth tasted strange - kind of sour, but good, and like everything before it turned into a sweet-smelling combination of kisses and tastes. Her tongue was all over my lips and tongue as she kissed me, and my hard on was pointing right towards her breasts.</p> <p>"Let's go for a walk", she said. "There are a lot more things to see about this house, and we can do it there alone, with you. Now, let's go take a warm bath."</p> <p>I followed her into the bathroom and she took off her panties with the little g-string still in place, and we stepped into the tub, and we kissed again, and we kissed so passionately it broke my heart. There is only one thing you can be happy about after a good orgasm: I did not get to feel that good again.</p> <p>Later that evening I went to a restaurant to read the novel to find a book but had to read an article to read for another friend. I would have an article to see my friend, and would not be sure how I don't want what I can think, and not andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
