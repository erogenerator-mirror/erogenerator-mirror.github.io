As I closed my eyes I could still feel the man's cock pressing against me, and the feeling of the pleasure he had given me, although brief.</p> <p>"Thank you, I believe you're quite eager to be married. But I have a few questions," the voice continued, "did you ever come across a man named, or named only by your name?</p> <p>I could feel something else inside of me filling up with passion, and a warm feeling washing over my body. I closed my eyes to let a feeling of joy as the feeling of the excitement he was feeling overwhelmed me.</p> <p>"My name is Ethel," the voice continued.</p> <p>"And I believe you could possibly be my fiancée, or my lover and best friend, no problem. You might even become much closer to me than ever. If so, then you're in for all of what I've come to expect. And, as you've been warned," the voice continued, "I'd give anything to be able to spend my life with you and be able to look into Ethel's eyes whenever you needed a reason to be there at all times.</p> <p>I looked down to the man's cock that was pressed against my body. I opened my eyes and saw that his eyes were closed in thought. I reached out with one of my hand and caressed the man's cheek, his face, his tongue, his cheekbone. I was surprised at the softness of his face.</p> <p>"Wow, young lady, you're certainly beautiful," the voice of the voice said.</p> <p>"Thank you, that's very kind. Oh, and Ethel, that's rather romantic in it's use. If we were married in the traditional sense, I'd give myself totally to you," the voice replied.</p> <p>The man's hands, seemingly involuntarily, reached forward, touching my breasts as he felt me naked under my sweater. His eyes were closed as he touched the softness of my breasts, and a smile came to his lips as they opened up slightly. Then, he reached down and slipped a finger into the waistband of my panties, before lowering it and lifting the garment off my body.</p> <p>It took him a moment, but I did the same, allowing him to see that I was completely naked beneath them, even in the dark as I felt his eyes on my body.</p> <p>"So, how does yours feel?" the voice asked as he stared at my breasts, my face, and my eyes.</p> <p>"It's quite wonderful, very, very enjoyable indeed," I replied as I leaned back in the bed, allowing my arms to rest on the night table.</p> <p>"Would you like to join us? Ethel and I enjoyed having you join us as well. Would you? It would seem only appropriate that you should enjoy joining us as well," Ethel said.</p> <p>The two young men on the upper section of the bed, as they were, were not fully awake, but I felt as if I was, nevertheless, about to do so.</p> <p>My breasts were covered with my sweater, and while my hands were still on the bed, I slowly eased my sweater off my shoulders, exposing my breasts.</p> <p>"Omigod, I'd love to join the three of you, together," Ethel said.</p> <p>"I'm sure Ethel could take me in the morning," Ethel continued.</p> <p>"So, does it excite you to be naked with me?" Ethel asked.</p> <p>"More than I could have imagined, that is," I replied, "if it were not so much the fact that I was getting naked with the two of you that made the most wonderful, if not only mutual, sexual situation for me."</p> <p>"So, Ethel then, Ethel, I also," the man?" the voice continued, "would you and me?"</p> <p>"Would you enjoy having my proposal of us?" one of us with one another proposal," I," and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
