The only explanation that could be provided is that the sky was not a perfect black of color, instead it was a beautiful, sparkling blue.</p> <p>However, to my utter astonishment, it is not all sky blue -- in fact, the light was still the same. The stars glowed in every single feature I could see:</p> <p>1) the blue light was brighter than the sun. 2) the light was longer, because of the temperature of the sun, or because I loved to love the sun, even when the temperature was hot and the day blue was cold. 3) the darkness was longer, because the sun was dark, if you can't see it -- the darker the sun, the lighter the moon. 4) I love to lick and eat you all over, as I do so regularly to please myself with your pleasure, and to make you come. 5) I love to kiss and taste you up close, even when you're cold. 6) I've loved sucking you off from the moment I saw you on the subway at the airport.</p> <p></p> <p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p> <p></p> <p>A short while after my visit, the next morning I awoke with a raging erection waiting for me, and to greet the arrival of my mother.</p> <p>"Good morning, Mom," I greeted my loving mother in greeting.</p> <p>"Hello, Henry," she replied, looking up at me with huge adoring eyes. "What can I do for you this morning?"</p> <p>"I have breakfast in our bedroom, would you like something?"</p> <p>"Not at this time. You can make it yourself," she agreed, pointing towards the bedroom.</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>She smiled at me once again, with such a radiant, joyful smile. She went on to tell me the things that she enjoyed from cooking. (We're all cooks, aren't we!) The fact that this is my last day with her, and as my mother, made me feel comfortable with her.</p> <p>As she spoke her thoughts, I saw that she was wearing her robe. (It's really really cute). She was also nude, as she had been last night.</p> <p>She was lying on a bed in my bedroom, I guessed that she had gotten up early and decided to leave the night before. Her breasts, even though they were not fully developed, had always been a handful. But when I was still a toddler, when I was little, they were larger than I remember. They even looked larger...</p> <p>"Do you have a toothbrush?" I asked, as I was curious to know if she had taken one myself.</p> <p>"Nope, toothbrush never goes near my stuff, and besides, I have to keep it in my purse." She said, giving me a wicked smile.</p> <p>"Oh, my gosh!" I laughed. "Of course I do."</p> <p>She started laughing too. That got me to realize that she did also take a good deal of notice. But then, I should have known. After the initial shock of her mentioning her toothbrush, our night together, and how great we had been in bed. I felt good again. But then, maybe not for long.</p> <p>I went to her room, but she stopped me at the door.</p> <p>"Please, Henry, if you're not hungry, you could fix me a sandwich."</p> <p>She went on to tell me the things she liked, and while I listened to her thoughts, I also wondered what kind of sexual activity she was talking about.</p> <p>"Please, I can't get enough of your father," she said, looking at me with lust. "His penis has never been any bigger than yours."</p> <p>"Oh, he's bigger. And what's so important about it is that it's the perfect size. Why didn't you tell me that?" I asked, feeling a bit sorry for her.</p> <p>"It's what the doctor calls a "rib". It's where it's circumcised so he's as long and thick in circumference as you."</p> <p>I was beginning to look forward to going down on her after breakfast, to see the shape of her pussy. That, and her lips that could engulf my erection.</p> <p>"You're not joking, are you, mom?"</p> <p>"No, not at all." She took off her robe, exposing her completely nude body.</p> <p>We're already naked, but the feeling of her naked flesh on mine was still exhilarating.</p> <p>"Will you eat me again, Mom?"</p> <p>"Do what you want to me, and see what you can do," she said, giving me her legs a sly smile. . . . "but I want to see me.</p> <p>. . just to come with the way before you." . "you. .</p> <p>. â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
