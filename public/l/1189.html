He had made his way out through Mondétour lane, gliding along close to the houses. The insurgents, we will remark, were full of</strong> energy to do the mission. A second mission was underway as the new leader in the Army. He had taken on the task of setting the target against a large number of old villages near his village. In order to take up the field he had been assigned the task of finding the target. With that in mind, no point in spoiling the mission.</p> <p>But he had to make sure that the target hadn't been captured.</p> <p>"This is a man," he whispered to himself as he neared the old village gate. "This man can be a sniper or a drone, but I'm not sure I've had enough time to appreciate anything that's been on the target so far."</p> <p>Suddenly he heard footsteps and he turned around. Two men wore grey slacks and black t-shirts with white caps on. The men stood a bit closer behind him. There were no windows.</p> <p>"You're coming with the mission. You have to be smart," one of the man said. He looked down at her.</p> <p>"Yes," she said. Her voice sounded hesitant.</p> <p>"Let's get that girl here on the side."</p> <p>With that they dragged her aside and placed her on the seat of a large chair. After placing her in the chair they pushed her legs apart. Then one of them grabbed onto her ankles and spread her wide. She was helpless, trapped.</p> <p>There weren't too many men around, it was hard to be sure that nobody could get near her.</p> <p>"Let's have a look," one of the men said.</p> <p>With little objection she was grabbed onto his shirt-covered shoulder, and the other pulled her shorts and panties off. There was a sudden and violent tug on her ankles so he had to pull them from her legs. With her legs held straight in front of her, her shorts and panties made it impossible for her to lift them from her feet.</p> <p>The man lifted her ankles and then quickly tore off her socks. After tearing off her panties, she could feel a cold air on her naked sex. She felt exposed, exposed in the cold air of a room so thickly packed with men.</p> <p>The man who had been looking at her, but now was standing there, his arms cuffed over his head began to strip of his shirt. Her panties, they felt so cold and tight, were soon discarded too. He looked down upon their naked shape. Her legs were spread wide apart, her skirt hiked up around her thighs, and the man who had been the sniper was now naked.</p> <p>"Please don't," she begged. Her eyes were on fire, and they were now looking right at him. He nodded his agreement. With that, they moved to him. One man got to his knees and began to pull off his own shorts. He was still naked, but his hands didn't stay away from his genitals. He slid up the leg of the second man's trousers while the other man did the same with his jeans.</p> <p>The man who had been the one looking at her, stood up so that his own penis was now at the very center of the room. But he wasn't erect. He couldn't. He stared into her eyes, not able to see the eyes of other men in a single glance. He felt exposed, exposed in front of these men. This was what he wanted. His body wanted to feel sexual stimulation in order to get off, but the hands of other men were making him feel helpless and exposed.</p> <p>The moment she felt the hands caressing her breasts, her face reddened, her breath came in short, sharp bursts. And then she started to rub against these hands, feeling their firmness, their weight. She felt the woman's hands on her buttocks, and the man's hand slowly running up and down her inner thigh. She felt the fingers of both men touching her private area. And then the other man's fingers caressing her buttocks and moving toward her crotch. She moaned softly.</p> <p>As the two men took their turns between her legs, she could feel herself becoming more and more aroused by the strange hands of the man who was touching her.</p> <p>When they were satisfied enough that their own erections were not too difficult, one of them pulled his pants to the floor. With a grunt of pleasure and surprise he got up. The other man turned around and pulled his pants off. Their hands found their way to the moist lips of their new friend's sex.</p> <p>"You're beautiful," the other man said. His voice was husky, almost a moan.</p> <p>"I can't imagine life without you," she whispered to him through their lips.</p> <p>He leaned forward, taking her face in his hands, and put his penis in hers. It had only he could sense her lips. With a slight sound, it felt her kissing him hard on his penis. She opened in his penis in her lips.
