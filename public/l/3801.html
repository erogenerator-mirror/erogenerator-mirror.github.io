His wife was still up in the kitchen, probably working on an assignment as my secretary. She had also returned from her trip to a nearby town.</p> <p>Kathevan made himself comfortable and settled down, propped his pillows at his head and relaxed. "I was thinking of fucking you," He whispered.</p> <p>"Of fucking you?" I giggled.</p> <p>"You know what I mean, honey. And you're a goddess. It was really quite fun..."</p> <p>"What? You thought this was a one-off thing, didn't you?"</p> <p>"No, you don't have to say that, honey."</p> <p>I took a deep breath and let it out slowly, and started to speak to him in an urgent voice. "Kath, will you do me the honors?" We had planned this whole night and we had even started talking. We were going to fuck and fuck. My husband was not going to fuck me to make up for the day's torture. I got up on the bed, climbed back on top and straddled him, my pussy fully on top of his dick in a smooth slide. We were fucking. We were fucking hard. We were fucking so fucking good that we had lost our minds. As I rode his dick I kissed him and his lips, his ears, on his chin. We were kissing, and he started to suck on my nipples, and when my lover sucked on my clit she was going to have a hellacious first fuck!</p> <p>Kathevan's cock was fully inside me and rubbing up against Gunes. I moaned and whimpered and I loved it, I loved the feeling of feeling him inside me so hard and so deep. I was so into him, so into fucking him, and so into getting fucked hard. But now I realized that he was going to come and I needed to keep going.</p> <p>"Kath, I love you." He pulled me up off of his dick and I realized with a sudden panic that I was still in a hurry to get him off of me. "I love you too, honey, I love you so much," he said, as he kissed and hugged me, our clothes still tangled.</p> <p>I thought I heard my husband grunt, but I knew it was him. Then the sound of a truck pulling into the driveway turned into the sounds of moaning and me laughing and it all hit me. I heard my husband's voice.</p> <p>"I'm coming, Gunes! Hard! Ah!" My husband shouted and he began fucking into me as he came. His dick was inside me in one smooth motion and the feeling of having him inside my manhood and having him inside me in the ass really gave me what I needed, and what I wanted. I rocked against him as he came and the sight was absolutely beautiful.</p> <p>When he came his cum went shooting up into my ass. My lover still kept fucking me and had his dick inside me so I could feel it against my back wall and in my pussy's warmth. They were in each other's arms.</p> <p>When I finally pulled off of their bodies I was all excited. I looked at them in the moonlight with my face all flushed and smiling and I was still in a rush to get their brains out.</p> <p>"I'll tell you all about it later, but for now let's get dressed."</p> <p>We had a great time dressed, which we both agreed. Then we hugged and kissed one another, and I told Gunes that when this was over I was going to have a go at him.</p> <p>"You didn't say..."</p> <p>"I said. I said I would tell you all about it later. I want you all to enjoy your visit."</p> <p>So we all got ready to go. As we stepped towards the door Kathevan wrapped his arms around me, pulled me close to him, and we kissed.</p> <p>We left the restaurant after an hour and walked to the airport where I saw a limousine waiting outside and, of course, it went to the hotel. Gunes had a room reserved, which he wanted to share with me.</p> <p>I walked back down to the hotel from our room and I found the elevator was a bit off. We had arranged that we would return to the room the night before and had changed the bed and made it a king-size bed. My lover's head was down on my right thigh and the sensation was incredible.</p> <p>Kathevan got off the elevator and I could hear him in the doorway to the room.</p> <p>"Let's sit here and watch a movie," I whispered and took his hand to lead him to the couch where I had left him when I fell to sleep earlier, naked and a long time ago, and then I was back on the floor with my lover. I had felt her tongue inside me and as her in me.
