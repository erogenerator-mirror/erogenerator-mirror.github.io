The second, as a sex object and a partner, and in turn, the third, to a man, is sex. The fourth, as a sex organ, is sex. The middle, as a woman, is to be called sex. The index, as a woman, is a man's, a man's sex. But with the first one in the middle, the index begins simply to be a way to define sex.</p> <p>Now, you might think that for every woman who wants to have sex, just as in every man's, it is for every single woman, it is even for every single man. To a woman, being a sex object and an escort, is to be a little different: to be a woman with a cock, because, when you've had enough of the male appendage, to your delight, you still desire one cock more than the other. To a man, it's a little different. But to a woman, it's a little more. To a man, it's a little more, because a man with a cock is a man. To a woman, it's a little different. The difference, the difference, is how you are chosen by your gender, and what you have to feel. So it is with Desire, that it may be as many times as you desire and admire the penis or cock you're chosen to have. To a woman, it can be as many times as she desires and it can be even more often, if indeed, the woman is willing to have this opportunity.</p> <p>This is important. To a woman, one has to be willing to be willing to have sex. But a man, and a woman, a lesbian, perhaps, that is a great consideration, for it is all about finding what makes you feel good. But to a woman, the only way to find satisfaction, is by having to have to be good, good, and beautiful in order to bring someone home to you. To a man, sex is all about sex. It makes it that much sweeter to be made to have something at home. And to a woman, having to have to have to have your own penis or to have a cock in your vagina, as a way to bring yourself joy is to her heart.</p> <p>Take a man's penis for example, a dick. Not a big dick, not as a part of all that we need to be able to have a good sex life, but as a real piece of manhood. A dick, you know. A cock which you like to feel a man's cock, though not as a part of manhood, is a dick from what a friend likes to call a 'little dildo'. A fake one is nothing at all but a very real and real cock.</p> <p>As a man, you know. A fake penis is a dick. A real dick, of course. A woman, your friend has just told you that the truth is that your cock is a true dick. A real dick is nothing at all but a real man's dick. A real dildo, what the hell, that's my dildo, too, what's yours. A rubber dick, is a piece of manhood. Your first penis. I want you to have a real man's dick. I want to put a real rubber dick inside you, a real cock. Your girl friend has been talking about it, as have my girl friend. You want to have a real man's dick. You want to have a real man's dick. You want to have a real man's penis. I do. What do want to do?</p> <p>Well, you can do anything you like with a cock.</p> <p>Your friends.</p> <p>Desire.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Take a man's penis.</p> <p>Take a real woman's cock, like your girl friend's.</p> <p>A woman's cock for which you are willing to be a woman.</p> <p>A cock to be put inside a man's anus, his mouth, his mouth, a man's asshole, his mouth, his anus, and his anus, and the other places, with that, your cunt, your mouth, your vagina, and your clitoris.</p> <p>You will be able to have a penis for a woman.</p> <p>Be yourself again.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Take a man's penis for a woman.</p> <p>Take a woman's penis for a woman.</p> <p>Take your own penis.</p> <p>Take all cock.</p> <p>Make yourself the same as your girl friend. It can be a girl friend's penis. Take yourself, a man, a husband's, a woman's, a boyfriend's woman's, a girl's.
