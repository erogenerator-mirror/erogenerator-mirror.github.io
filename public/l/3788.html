Her pussy was a mess of her juices and saliva. "That's not all you have to do," I whispered.</p> <p>She moaned in appreciation. I had to taste her. I lifted her up to her knees and spread her knees as wide apart as they'd go, to expose her anus to my gaze. When the first part of my lips touched her opening, I felt the muscles in her anus contract. She sighed and groaned; her body relaxed as if I'd just released a heavy burden of stress. I knew all about what she enjoyed, and where she liked to be touched, touched, sucked. Her sex, my mouth, and tongue were all I could do for the first time in my life. I was surprised at how many sensitive nerve endings we could sense, too.</p> <p>When I put my tongue deep inside her, she moaned loudly again. This time, my tongue was in charge: moving all around and exploring, finding, and stimulating what seemed to be more sensitive nerve endings than before; especially her sphincter. But when I moved it up inside her, she moaned again; her face contorted in pleasure, her eyes squeezing shut as if in pain.</p> <p>I worked her clit with my tongue, just like I knew would happen with mine and her pussy; just as I had done with mine, but with less pressure. And I worked her clit more often, even when she came to an orgasm. It seemed too good to be true. Her moans became louder, with less urgency; instead of just sucking and licking her most sensitive part, what I wanted was to fuck her as hard as I could. I worked her clit for a long, time and she nearly came but didn't. I loved it, too. She came in an explosion of pure pleasure from inside her body, while still writhing on the bed, with every wave and contraction.</p> <p>When she had calmed down enough to speak, she spoke to me in ragged breaths. "Mmm, that's nice. That was great. Thank you. I could cum again right now—for you, for me, if you gave me that all-or-nothing treatment—without giving you that treatment—I couldn't have asked for..."</p> <p>Her words were still echoing in my mind while she was speaking those words. I reached for the pillow I threw away, to lay on and put it over her face. She turned her head to the side, her face on the pillow, and reached with her hand to touch it. She didn't touch my pussy—she touched it, and I reached for her hand, too, and kissed it. It was her first touch; it felt wonderful and comforting.</p> <p>I turned, pulled her up onto me, and lay her on her back on the bed with her legs apart, still on my bed, looking down at her in lust-driven desperation. I knew exactly what she was thinking, but I knew that there was no stopping her from wanting another hard fucking.</p> <p>Without warning, she rolled on top of me, and her knees bent up against my belly. She took my hand, kissed my palm, and sucked on each finger. It was so different from a dick. "What are you waiting for?" she asked. "My pussy can't wait. Are you ready?"</p> <p>"Sure is," I replied. And I said nothing else about it until she said, "Then fuck me like you fucked me yesterday; you know, like when I gave you a blowjob?"</p> <p>"Yes," I agreed. Our bodies were still coupled, with me on the bottom. I felt her hips come up, then pull down, making the mattress jump and jiggle a bit. "Now, fuck me like you fuck me yesterday; fuck me like you fuck me now." She took my hands and placed them on her breasts, then raised them so I could kiss her nipples, and then lowered them. "Hard," she urged. I did. And fucked her, hard, and as hard as I could. She moaned and gasped, until her orgasm hit, and she climaxed again and again. Again. And again. Until they both came together, and my dick gave a final, involuntary surge of semen into her sopping wet box, and they came together for the first time together, one after the other, for two hours, two years and a day.</p> <p>It was amazing, and it was wonderful, and it was perfect. I loved her and it. I loved it, I liked it. It was special, and I liked it, it was what. It was more intense, and my very special, my motherly, beautiful. It was special in every sensation that—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
