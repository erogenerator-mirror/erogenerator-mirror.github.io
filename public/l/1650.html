She looked up in his</strong> lust-swollen eyes, her smile broad, as her mouth moved to his.</p> <p>He was still hard, still inside her, still twitching inside her, throbbing and stiff under her tight, warm body. Her soft lips slid up and down his shaft as if he was fucking the woman in the mirror, her eyes dancing in passion with delight as she tasted his lips and tongue. Her body had gone limp like a puppet beneath him, not yet recovered from a long, sensuous night.</p> <p>She whispered into his ear, “Oh Robert, I’m so hot for you. I want to feel you in me.”</p> <p>Robert began to move. He was so surprised and aroused to feel her body beneath him, the warmth of her cunt, the hardness of her nipples, the softness of her smooth curves…it was just so incredible. He thrust himself upwards, deeper into her, fucking her. His balls slapped her ass with every thrust of his cock and, for many minutes, they fucked – they touched one another, they moved, they felt one another move – it was as if they were in time and space, as if they were one…</p> <p>Her warm cunt gripped him…she moaned, she gasped. She had never done this before.</p> <p>Her breasts were swaying in rhythm with his movements, the nipples hard; she wrapped her fingers tightly around each one and pulled. Robert could barely move with her body wrapped around him...He felt as if he’d been caught in the wildest of sexual pleasures. He felt her clench tightly around him, her ass pressed up tight against his pelvis, as she shuddered against him.</p> <p>Her hair fell across his eyes, silken from perspiration; she held him in place, her legs around him, her body quivering.</p> <p>“Oh my God!” he grunted softly as he fucked her again and again, feeling his cock swell in her pussy, the head against her cervix.</p> <p>“Oh my God!” he gasped “I’m going to cum!”</p> <p>“Oh Robert…we can still have fun together!” she murmured breathlessly as her breathing became labored, then she sighed…and moaned.</p> <p>“I’m cumming too!” the sexy redhead cried.</p> <p>The lovers were close now. They had been able to get away with the wildest sexual things, but now it was time to set something else off in a more sophisticated fashion.</p> <p>“So I guess we can do it again,” she giggled dreamily, kissing him on the lips and moving her pussy up against him as he fucked her…</p> <p>As the two friends fucked in various positions, Robert remembered something from the library.</p> <p>“I want to fuck you…” he said.</p> <p>“And you can go for me, but first I want to feel your huge cock inside me!”</p> <p>Robert moved off the bed and kneeled in front of her. She looked so beautiful. Her legs were still shaking, her body taut and firm, her breasts trembling, her face flushed, her chest rising higher with arousal, she smiled wide and nodded her head when he moved up against her…</p> <p>He moved on the bed, standing behind her, his cock standing straight, long, hard, rigid and stiff. She guided it to her cunt and he eased himself forward, pushing himself into her slowly until he felt her hot, wet cunt surrounding him. They had been fucking all night – and had been in positions far more exciting to him than any other he had ever had before – but now she was offering herself to him, for him, for her, to take him!</p> <p>She held him, as if for his own self-preservation, as he began to fuck her. He moved inside her…it was a tight fit, a tight cunt, almost an impossible fit, but a tight, warm, slippery fuck.</p> <p>They moaned in sync with each other as they fucked…she held him inside her with her right hand, she pressed herself against him with her left. Together, they fucked with long strides, sliding their hard bodies together, moving their hips in a long, languid rhythm, enjoying them, each of them, their bodies.</p> <p>Their hips were moving in perfect unison, pressing up against each other, up and down, up and down…they were in lustful heaven, in the way they had wanted them since the first time they had made love, the way they had been in that room just three feet from his, in the room that had turned his life into a dream.</p> <p>inside his house – inside their house!’s into reality…into a reality!</p> <p></p> <p>into his own into their hearts into a whole—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
