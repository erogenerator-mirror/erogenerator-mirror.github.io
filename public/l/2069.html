He that feareth death, either feareth that he shall have no sense at</h4><p><strong>all, or that his senses will not be the same. Whereas, he should rather comfort himself, that either no sense at all, and so no sense of evil; or if</strong> he will ever find the right sense to be truly human can not be too bad.</p> <p>How do I make it to those two nights?</p> <p>Chapter 10.</p> <p>Time stands still.</p> <p>After all that's happened...well, maybe he could still make a difference.</p> <p>***</p> <p>"It seems everyone else is asleep," Alice told Emily as she opened the door to her bedroom. "You going to bed, or do something with your hands."</p> <p>"I'd like to sleep with my hands on my body, Emily." She pulled her dress shoes off, and sat down on the edge of her bed.</p> <p>"It feels nice to me not to have to be with you."</p> <p>"You're always tired," Emily grinned as she turned to sit on her bed.</p> <p>"What's your favorite, Mom?" She turned to sit next to her daughter, "Are you going to tell your mother about when I told her you and I split?"</p> <p>"She'll know, sweetie. That's the way we've always been."</p> <p>"Good. Because, I'm your mother, and you should have my back."</p> <p>"Yeah right." Her father said, walking toward the door to her room.</p> <p>***</p> <p>"And where's my brother?" John asked Sarah as they pulled up to the house's front entrance, on the third floor.</p> <p>"Down at the library. He is going to the library."</p> <p>John turned off the headlights, and Sarah turned toward her father.</p> <p>"So we don't have to go back up."</p> <p>"No." Sarah nodded while she opened his door and pushed down the passenger side door, then closed it again. "We have to stay here for a while."</p> <p>"Yeah, but we don't have to go back." Sarah's brother, John, smiled while they went inside, while he was in his study. "It looks like it will take her a lot longer to get here." "Well, I guess it will."</p> <p>John put on a pair of shorts and a T-shirt, then climbed in behind his daughter. When Sarah slid her dress straps down, he lifted them.</p> <p>"Mom, you're already in your underwear."</p> <p>"I don't wear underwear." Sarah smiled wickedly.</p> <p>"You look so great in your underwear."</p> <p>"Well...maybe we shouldn't worry about it." Sarah reached behind her to undo her bra, and took off her red thong.</p> <p>"You wouldn't like Mom to see your breasts," John chuckled as Sarah pulled it away.</p> <p>"Well, you might say that." Sarah turned to look at her mother. "How's that for sexy, huh?"</p> <p>"It's sexy." Sarah pushed down her dress, giving a sexy show. "My bra doesn't cover much."</p> <p>John's eyes went wide as he heard them talk about his mother.</p> <p>"Are you really wearing your bra right now?" Sarah asked.</p> <p>"That way I'll be able to see up your blouse."</p> <p>John pulled off his own shirt, and began unfastening that bra.</p> <p>"There you go," Sarah said with a smile while she watched them. She slid her bra out of the sleeve of her dress, and then sat down next to her mother.</p> <p>"This is the first bra I've felt in years." Sarah pulled her breasts away from her chest, showing her nipples. "This way I can see them better and be able to decide for myself if they're good."</p> <p>Sarah turned to John. "I can't wait until we get to the library."</p> <p>John grinned at her. "I'm sure we can find something that'll stop that, and still take your mind off my penis, and off your worries about being naked around you."</p> <p>Sarah stared at her sister for a moment.</p> <p>"So Mom, you like being naked around you."</p> <p>"Okay." Sarah put on a big grin while she pushed down her panties, revealing her smooth pussy.</p> <p>"Why don't you go sit in just a pair of shorts?" John put on his shorts and shirt, and walked over to his daughter's bedroom.</p> <p>Sarah stood there, while John reached into his shorts and pulled down his underwear.</p> <p>"So you can see my mom naked."</p> <p>"And I can see your naked brother."</p> <p>Sarah stood and then lowered her bra to her knees.</p> <p></p> <p>Sarah stood and fell and fell and fell again.</p> <p>Sarah's her.
