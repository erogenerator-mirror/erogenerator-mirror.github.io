But, alas, what we could do is to get a closer look at the object we seek.</p> <p>Perhaps, because, with the greatest lust, the ultimate goal is the pursuit of an orgasm…, our bodies know how a man can’t resist an orgasm. We can all feel it, we can feel us…, our bodies…, and with an even better understanding of what men’s needs and desires are and what the true joys and pleasures of climaxing in others is, we can look at each other in the mirror, and watch each other as we pleasure ourselves. And the more we have these feelings that we do, the better each others bodies will be and the deeper we will need each other in the way that we so carefully seek our pleasure.</p> <p>And, with those thoughts, I knew I could really enjoy the look of complete surrender that is our ultimate pleasure. That was all well and good, but if I enjoyed it as much as women, I’m going to love what women can do to me…</p> <p>So, I slid my hand into my shorts, feeling my cock getting harder and growing thicker…, I took out one of my favourite vibrators, an 8” vibrating dildo, with a small switch. I could feel my heart beating fast, and I started to massage my cock with the dildo. I slowly inserted it deep into my groin, feeling it rubbing me all over…, making me almost dizzy…, but not quite as much as this…, I’ll keep it up…, and so, while I was stroking my cock, my hand was on my chest, and I was feeling my legs tremble, and the dildo in my shorts getting warmer and warmer…, so I decided to go for it, and I pulled out my dildo, and put it inside of my crotch, while turning it on full. I started to stroke it in and out of my crotch, and I was really getting into what I was doing. “So,” I thought, “she has not been this good with women…, and it will be good to let her do a lot of the things she wants,” I thought. Then I remembered that I’d read somewhere, that men make a wonderful pair of lovers for women…, and that all I should enjoy was the woman’s pleasure…,</p> <p>I slowly inserted the dildo deeper into my crotch, feeling it rubbing my belly and my chest…, even though of course it went deep inside my balls. The effect of the dildo on my cock was immediate, I felt the head of my cock start to swell…, and then I heard my mother moaning, “Oh…, I like it…, I like it…, Oh…. I’m about to come…,” and I came, which surprised me a bit…, but I was still trying to control the pleasure and the pulsation of my cock. I knew that, with the right touch, and after the stimulation which I’d just had on my chest, I would have come again, too…, and then, suddenly, my dick exploded, and came on the carpet….,</p> <p>There must have been at least nine minutes of ecstasy until my mother came around. “Oh, John…, have we done it,” I wondered, “have we been to ourselves…, but,”, she said, “It was so very special to see you enjoying yourself with others…"</p> <p>So, to say that I was quite happy would be an understatement…, and I was pleased with how I felt about it.</p> <p>“No," was all I could say, and, with a little bit of regret, asked, “have you done it to yourself…?”</p> <p>“No, it’s no wonder…, it’s so exciting…,” was all I could say.</p> <p>She replied, “I enjoyed it immensely; you can still do it, if you like…, if you like…,” “Not just you…,” I thought, “for me,” was all she said.</p> <p>I told her it was alright, and that I didn’d love to see her, feel and touch her breasts, too. I was so horny…, and touch her, I want…, she was so much. And I was…, oh she wanted I knew—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
