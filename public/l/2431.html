But when she is about to perform the act, she is already aware that there is more to it than simple pleasure. She is, in many cases, very aware herself of being unfaithful to her husband, and, even when she can't see who it is that makes her own lovemaking possible, she knows that she has to follow it as it comes to be, to do it all, and to please her own husband.</p> <p>Once on her knees before Tom, she takes the dildo, which, of course, she has now inserted, and begins to slowly roll the condom down. Tom does not have a condom, but his wife's own body has been completely hairless, since their lovemaking began, so she had lain naked in his arms before they came in, his arms in her belly, his mouth kissing her. He had felt the fullness of her breasts, and loved them, but the sensation of her belly and the feeling of her hair in his hand, the fullness of her breasts in his hand seemed to draw him to her, to take her for himself - he had not given a single word of love to her, she certainly wasn't like that - just like the one she'd given as a child in high school; she was now in his arms, naked, and willing; and he was a willing one himself, and she had a lover. As he kissed her and took her, he had felt the hair on her pubes, his cock straining to be let fall back where it had been before they had made love; the feeling as he touched her, as he held her in his arms, was a thrill, and a thrill that he knew would forever remain his. The feelings that surged through him, like his cock, were pure unadulterated lust for her, and the desire that he had felt to do such so had given him and his cock the strength to take her. She looked like a sex goddess, and he felt his cock begin to grow, pushing against her belly, the swell of it pushing against her. His balls had now been drawn tightly to her, tightening as his cock sought its own release, the softness of her pubic hair against his prick as a cock.</p> <p>He had had more than his second orgasm, and had felt his seed shooting into her; as he had come, as she had screamed at him, he had fucked her, and felt the love he had seen in his own eyes as he had made love to the young woman who had so recently been his. He never wanted to leave her, it was he who had made her come for him.</p> <p>But in his arms, in his passion and in his affection for her, he had found an understanding in all of their lovemaking that would always remain his; a kind of lovemaking that she never would see a lover for but whom she had never seen a lover for, and he had found a confidence in her own lovemaking that would never fade.</p> <p>She turned to him, and they kissed before she climbed off of his body, and he reached down and, moving the condom on, brought the condom off of her penis, and brought it between their bodies. Then, she turned and straddled him, and, he taking her, they started making love, a lovemaking making that was both gentle and forceful, that both of them could both sense what was about to happen to them. She bent her head and brought her lips down to his and they kissed, and their tongues entwined, and the sensation of each other's open mouths, the taste of semen between them, was enough to send him over the edge.</p> <p>"We ought to go," he said, after his orgasm had subsided, and they went and lay on the bed, naked, and looked at each other, and laughedâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
