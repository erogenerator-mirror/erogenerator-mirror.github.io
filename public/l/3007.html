When Adam walked into the bedroom naked and sweaty he turned the music up. As the sound of the Soule made him dizzy and weak, his lust filled eyes opened in awe and fear and lust. He had no idea what was behind the sight. If the soule was evil, he felt the soule deserved to be taken away from the flesh of the flesh.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" asked Adam. "That's impossible, this is madness."</p> <p>"Trust me. I will not harm you." The soule smiled and kissed Adam's chest.</p> <p>It had begun as a game, in the most dangerous way possible. Then she was made to suck his cock. It was a real game. And the truth was that the first course took a whole new form.</p> <p>"This is really difficult," said Adam. It took all his courage to continue, "I am sure I won't hurt you."</p> <p>"Don't be afraid, sweet."</p> <p>The soule climbed onto the bed, and lowered her pussy into a prone position. She slowly lowered herself onto the bed next to Adam, who had been lying on his left side. Her breasts swayed above him, offering an intimate view of her nipples, from which they reached almost their full height. The Soule smiled, licked her lips, and looked downward.</p> <p>"Your dick is really good," she whispered. She began to rub her nipples softly. "I don't know how long I can last."</p> <p>The lust was in the room now, but at the same time he felt a warmth. He felt a warmth that he had never felt in his life. "I don't know." He was afraid. He wanted to lose himself to her.</p> <p>"It's up to you. Your body is in charge. If you give yourself to me without permission, I will kill you. Do you understand me?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"I could kill you, but the truth is I'm very well-endowed," the soule said with a smile. "I don't want to hurt you. I do not want you to fall to me from you current position."</p> <p>"Thank you...ohmigod," said Adam, as the soule began to push her breasts forward. "Thank you."</p> <p>The soule continued to rub her nipples while she lowered her lips to his face. Their lips came together.</p> <p>Adam couldn't believe this. The lust in her eyes and her lips were a mixture of passion and desire. They became full and wild. His arms wrapped around her. Her tongue darted in and out of his mouth.</p> <p>"Ohmigod," said Adam.</p> <p>"You are so amazing. Your tongue is like a snake! How can being a man be more wonderful than a woman?"</p> <p>"Maybe," said Adam. "Maybe this is a dream." This was a moment of madness.</p> <p>"Why do you think I came here?" asked her, pulling away from him and turning around.</p> <p>"Because you're a soule and I a man who's soule."</p> <p>"Don't you want to make love with a man before he comes into your body?"</p> <p>"Of course not."</p> <p>"It must be impossible. It's more than I remember. This night seems much more beautiful now."</p> <p>As she moved towards him, the soule opened a drawer and removed some white material. Adam couldn't see what it was but from the dim light it appeared to be a vibrator. The soule slowly lowered herself onto it. She spread herself, and looked down while slowly moving it around inside her. Her breasts were large and soft with nipples that stood straight out. It would be difficult to lie down on it and still be able to enjoy the sensation of her pussy as the sugel vibrators moved over and around her.</p> <p>"Ah," she said, as she brought his hips to the bed and gently lowered herself onto his penis. The soule smiled as she pushed herself onto him. Her breasts swayed above him while he lifted her. She let her head fall back and his head fell into her neck when she lowered herself onto his cock again.</p> <p>They kissed while their bodies moved together. The soule was moving with him and the moans was not so much with hers and the noise she made above him, as the vibrator's motion was moving up and down against her.</p> <p>"Yes," cried the soule on the pillow. "Yes, it's so good. I want to feel this."</p> <p>Adam's tongue found her nipple and began to tease it. The sule began to move her hips up and the bed. Adam's and the bed. They looked each other person in the other's face. The other's breasts. The thing on the other's face on the bed.</p> <p></p> <p>one'sâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
