G. Wells </h3><h4>FRIDAY NIGHT.</h4><p><strong>The most extraordinary thing to my mind, of all the strange and wonderful things that happened upon that Friday, was the dovetailing of the commonplace habits of our social order</strong>, and of the joy of fucking in a way that was, as far as my mind could relate to the other human beings I'd known and fucked in all the years and years I had known. And that was the one thing that happened to me on that particular date.</p> <p>I looked through the peephole in the door as I stepped out of the bathroom and into the living room, where George was having a beer. "Where's Sam?"</p> <p>"In bed," said Sam, his head on the arm of the sofa. Now that my gaze was upon him, all I could think about was George's lips on the skin of my lower belly and that delicious, heavenly nectar which had been dripping through the fabric of his blue jeans earlier that evening. He was standing, looking like some Greek goddess or something in the back of this little car.</p> <p>"He's out," I replied. "Come on. Tell George that we're leaving now."</p> <p>That was the thing that occurred to me in the most unexpected way. The same feeling I had on our first date, when I had seen Sam enter into my heart, as he kissed, licked, and nuzzled me all over. I watched to hear if Sam's eyes widened, and to discover his lips parted, and the tip of his tongue found mine. Oh, my God! The feeling of his tongue inside of my mouth, of our bodies intertwined, of his arms sliding around me like silk, of my hair, of my legs pressed against him, and, of course, of our own bodies doing what we were doing.</p> <p>Oh, Sam! Oh, Sam! It was so fucking hot!</p> <p>We were standing there. The whole house. The floor beneath our feet.</p> <p>I wasn't quite so sure. All that was happening with that big beautiful black cock—all the way down my throat, down the length of it!—was that there was something about the way it was going in, about what I felt, what it was doing in me, that it belonged there. Maybe it did belong there to make it even more beautiful and wonderful within me, and that's what it was at the back of the big black car.</p> <p>He didn't move. Just looked at me. There was so much in that expression on his face. I wanted to tell him to kiss me again, but that wouldn't come. He was so damn handsome. He was so damn sexy!</p> <p>"I'm tired of these damn clothes," I said finally to myself. "This damn thing. It's time to go."</p> <p>Sam looked at me as if I was one of those famous movie stars, and he smiled.</p> <p>"No," I said, and then I looked over at George.</p> <p>"Fuck it," I told him. "Get undressed. And come on, Sam. Help me."</p> <p>I watched through the peephole as Sam moved. I saw his muscular body, from head to toe, the way the blue light of his skin, the way the light of the fire on the mantle in the living room, and the long wavy dark hair along his back as he worked his way unhooked his pants and unzipped them. I looked up at the black cock, that he was not at all interested in, but was clearly going to have it.</p> <p>Sam was going to fuck it, and I was going to suck his cock. It would all have been just that, I realized, that it wouldn't be any more of a date than our first date. As it was.</p> <p>But just then, it wasn't that, but the moment Sam reached for his belt buckle, his eyes went back into their bedroom. I couldn't say if there was anything more that could come of talking to George about that, or more—maybe more—with Sam, but it had to be obvious to me now and then, that there were times when everything, even the thought of having sex with Sam had, at least for me, become a sort of a sort of a sort of an all-consuming memory. There was no other reason, no other thought.</p> <p>We weren't going to leave now.</p> <p>Sam reached for his pants, which, on top of all the clothes that had been discarded by the time we left the house before, he was carrying at least, in some parts, and certainly in others, as much as I was. Then, as I stood and walked with him through the door and to the bedroom, Sam asked, "Do you think it's a great plan to go out there with you in those pants, and to suck Sam's cock?"</p> <p>The question surprised me. I had really been expecting Sam to see something that, that sort of thing, that I suppose I might say: a plan, but in some way. But, it wasn't, Sam, that's just the same as I have this:—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
