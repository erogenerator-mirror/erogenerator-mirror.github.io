It separated into two streets, which ran in a slanting line, one to the right, and</strong> one to the left. To get to the third Street he made it another hundred and fifty paces or so. The sidewalk went on forever. Each Street had its other Houses, the streetlights behind it, and the streetlights behind it's other Houses were lined with a block lights. After three more blocks, the street's lights fell down. Now it was about fifteen feet to the left of its street. This is the second time a street light fell to the wrong street. When it did, people were walking around, in suits or in robes, talking to, or just watching. There were no other lights in the street, other than a faint red glow. On another street, a light lit the street. At this distance, it looked like a building. A fire-engine.</p> <p>Two lights went off in different directions as people watched them approach or wait to see what happened. The street lights were always out, because in those lightless years people were still living at various times. But for now, one of the street lights was on. To get to the eighth street, he had to walk down the block a little, but to the right and then to the left. Then back and then back to the street light. During the walk, he saw that there were a couple places to turn around. He would turn down a lane on his way to the end of street after him. But on the next lane, before turning down another lane, he had to stay on the right lane. He left the lane to his right to avoid a lane and to run the other way. He also left the other lane to his left to avoid turning the other way. At each turn, his pace was slow. In the streets, one lane was usually empty. During the next two turns, the traffic would light up, so that the city was always dark with one street light.</p> <p>At eight, he walked right past a place called the "O-Spot." It was a large and comfortable looking place with many benches and tables. There was also a table and chairs, and more people. He had to put his hand in his pocket and take it. He took a look, and decided it was where the light was and the spot. It was a sort of theater. There was a small stage in the center. The stage was up on a platform a little off-center. After he knocked on the dark-blue door on the table, the light flashed, but in the other light, it looked more like a room. He saw that the stage was not very large and a couple people were sitting. Another couple sat down and two couples stood up. Another couple stood up and sat down. He noticed that they were naked. The light on the stage showed a scene of three naked people, a pretty brunial, and a red-haired boy with a big dick. The boy and the big dick, both with their head hanging in the air, the guy with his butt hanging down, the girl with a long nose, and her tits on her knees. The guys had their heads up and their hands on the girls' heads, and they were jerking them off. The girl was lapping up the guy's dick. After several minutes the guy's dick began to twitch. He put his hand on the girls' head, and then began to fuck his cock up and down. The blonde girl was watching the guy go into her mouth and her head shaking. After a bit the guy's dick twitched one last time, and then he pulled out of the girl's mouth with an audible 'pop.' The guy sat down in the chair and the girl sat down. Then she turned her face to the wall and went up on her toes.</p> <p>There were twenty people waiting to get a glimpse of the stage, and twenty people were seated on the platform waiting for the lights to go up. He could not see the stage himself very well, but he was pretty sure everyone was watching the dark-blue stage on the stage. After the lights went up, the light came on again and the lights came back on, just a little faster this time.</p> <p>With the light on as long as possible, and the lights off so long as well, it was time for a good show. He stood and took off his clothes. He had not been dressed much all that much in the last three hundred or so hours, except for a pair of shoes, which he took off when he went out to the street, with his pants.</p> <p>When he took off his clothes, he was naked all the way. He walked a few steps to the center of the stage where the lights were still on. He bent down, spread his arms, and put his feet on three metal slanting platforms on a wooden seats in the stage-in the stage. Now- floor. He went up and down, and down. He walked a few people got to get a chair first, went over to chair, then back—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
