That is best for every one, that the common nature of all doth send</h4><p><strong>unto every one, and then is it best, when she doth send it.</strong></p> <p>Dear John,</p> <p>It took me awhile to get over this incident with you. Thank you for everything that transpired. I hope we can do it again.</p> <p>Yours,</p> <p>Yours,</p> <p></p> <p>With love, X-Art,</p> <p>Jenna.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The following is my story, written for a friend and lover. It contains the names, characters and places of fictional characters. Any resemblance to persons, places, events or events, between these persons and you, is a gross and very real faux pas. Do not copy these characters.</p> <p>† † †</p> <p>I awoke the next morning to an empty bed and I looked around the room. The sheets had been pulled down and blankets and the covers that had been thrown aside were scattered around the room. I felt an instant sadness that I didn't realize I'd been dreaming. I'd woken up horny as hell.</p> <p>After looking around the room I started taking a look of the bedside clock. 8 O'clock.</p> <p>The moment that I woke up I got out of bed and walked towards my room. I put on the shirt I was wearing that day that I was still sleeping, but I didn't bother putting the shirt on. I was really starting to get hard and I didn't know exactly how to start. I picked up the clothes that I was given and went through them. A pair of jogging shorts, a top and my favorite pair of sweatpants I don't think I wore in the house since it had been a couple days since I got laid. I don't remember where I got it from, but I definitely don't think I've worn it today.</p> <p>I turned back towards the mirror and saw the hairbrush that I'd thrown in the laundry room earlier that day before I opened it. I saw my body, my chest and my abs I could see clearly. I saw myself through the glasses again. I saw the curve of my arm and my legs. I saw my cock. I saw my balls and I saw how I moved without them getting uncomfortable. I smiled because my cock was hard and I didn't mean to even though I had a hard time controlling it.</p> <p>I had a look at my ass and I was surprised how toned it looked. I was actually trying to be casual about my body. I thought of one of my girlfriends who'd told me that her ass looked good even though her ass was just a tiny bit large since she didn't have a big ass. I could probably fit a small cock into the crack of her ass. My cock would fit, but not by much. I tried to picture it as a penis. I'd like to have some kind of penis. Maybe a big one. Even large enough for my cock.</p> <p>Suddenly I heard someone tapping on my door. I opened it to see a gorgeous blonde woman on my door step and I couldn't help smiling because she was absolutely hot. The thought of her being hot turned me on even more and I started making a lot of noise about how happy I'd been the past two days. I walked over and put the earphones on her as a reward. I had to give her high heels before she woke up but before that. She opened my bedroom door to see my smile and she looked so cute. I felt like I needed to say something and was about to apologize when she started giggling.</p> <p>"Oh my God," she said. I could hear a tear run down her cheek as she said her name.</p> <p>"Oh my god," was what I said to her that morning.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I'm so freaked out this morning," she said. I thought she'd be crying for the longest time because she was so adorable.</p> <p>"I know you're having a hard time not looking at my hair," I said.</p> <p>"I'm just trying to be normal," she said. She wiped away some tears that were streaming down her cheek which were pretty big on her face. "I don't want to get into a habit of staring at myself," she said, as her voice trailed off and she was still giggling.</p> <p>She wiped her face again and then she started laughing once again trying to be happy.</p> <p>"If you look so cute in your shirt you must be a genius," I thought as I looked at her. "I don't need to make up my mind as to how to start something that I never thought I'd have to go through with," I thought. "I can just do this," I thought and I looked at my hands.</p> <p>She was in my top. I thought she had picked it up.</p> <p>I looked at her hair and tried to find her own. "I was so many strands at her hair. I had picked her hair that moment. I tried to make it up and she had—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
