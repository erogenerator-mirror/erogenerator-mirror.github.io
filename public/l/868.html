All</strong> of a sudden, a smile on my face!</p> <p>I must admit that I did notice the look in her eyes, though. When she was wearing a simple, yellow tee and white cotton pajama bottoms, you could almost tell she and I were sharing an intimate moment of sexual awakening. But now, she felt very alone amidst her own anxiety and uncertainty, as I too began to feel the first stirrings of excitement.</p> <p>The next thing that I knew, Holly had rolled over on her back, her legs straight, her eyes still gazing intently, mouth slightly open and a warm smile on her lips.</p> <p>I reached between her thighs; she'd parted them and her skirt had been drawn up to provide just enough cover to provide my fingers access to her vulva. I found her clit at the top of her pussy; and as my fingers gently began to slide over it, she began to rock her body as her breathing began to come in little whimpers of expectation. My fingers continued to slide over her clit, and her face took on an expression of joy in anticipation.</p> <p>She raised her hips and I could see that she was becoming incredibly nervous. My penis, which by now had begun to swell from the anticipation of having its way inside her, was becoming extremely erect. It stood almost straight up, its pink tip twitching in accordance to its need.</p> <p>I whispered "Holly's pussy" to her. Her eyes lit up and she smiled wickedly and asked, "But isn't it going to hurt a little? I like that feeling of being inside you, John. Would you like me to move?"</p> <p>The look in her eyes told me that I understood exactly what she meant. I was a little surprised.</p> <p>With her consent, I lifted my cock up and slowly slid along her cunt lips, feeling the smooth walls of her vagina envelope the swollen flesh beneath. She sighed with pleasure as I slid home once more – and with my hips resting against her butt; and she started to push her hips up against me.</p> <p>She wrapped her arms tightly around my neck to pull herself tightly against me; our bodies meshing as her body squirmed and squirmed against mine. We breathed slowly and deeply as her lips parted and I felt her wetness against my thigh. I knew her clitoris was a big one, and I could feel it throbbing against my thigh.</p> <p>My hips began to rotate slowly as I slid into her. I could feel her warm juices running up the inside of my leg; I closed my eyes as I felt my hard penis sliding over and around the soft skin of her clit once more. We kept on exchanging looks, then, as I lifted my hips and began to slide in and out, it felt as if I'd be pulling all the way out of her – but it also felt as if I was holding myself with just one hand. Our eyes had never met before – I'm sure as much excitement as she felt, when she realized that she was about to get what she had wanted for so long.</p> <p>Her breathing increased as she started to get louder and heavier, and her eyes locked on mine with eagerness. My hand was now between us; our bodies were sliding against each other in perfect motion. We leaned in close and our eyes were locked with each others eyes. She had started to rise up – again! – and her eyes opened to meet mine. My penis slid deeper into her vagina as she pulled me against her; she was pushing her pussy down on top of me – and we were both moaning quietly as our bodies writhed and wriggled together. It was then my body began to jerk as I came into her body – we were both grunting together as I pushed into her again and drove my penis into her with great force as I reached my own orgasm.</p> <p>Our kiss broke for a moment as our breathing slowed and we lay side by side on blankets – both feeling exhausted. I rolled onto my side to spoon with her, still inside of her, and she slid her arm around my waist and laid her head against my chest. I reached my arm out to caress her hair, and she sighed. Her hand was slowly caressing along my back as we drifted off to sleep. When I was able to move, I slid off the bed, picked up my clothes, and left the room to change. I made my way back to the living room to make some coffee, and I turned on the tv to re-watch some episodes on my iPhone.</p> <p>When the coffee was ready, I went to the bathroom to take my clothes off: my jeans still on the floor. My shirt was hanging loosely on my arm. I went back to my room and got a fresh clean pair of panties from my dress bag to slip into the laundry in from its bathroom to put away, returning to finish the nightclothes and be put it in.
