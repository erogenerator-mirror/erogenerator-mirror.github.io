A Squeeze of the Hand.</h4><p><strong>That whale of Stubb’s, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to the Pequod’s side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the</strong> very rich, and there was no need to waste time, as these two beauties were already enjoying their sexual pleasures, and there was to be no more for them that they didn’t know, though they were in need of, more, than that, was there, that night.</p> <p>The two were a little too eager. They were going to let them go at it for ages before they would return again, and if they behaved like that, it was just the two of them together, enjoying it, as much as they had enjoyed it, in the beginning.</p> <p>Not this year. Well, that was alright with the two of them, was the thing for them to decide. But this next year. They had only just finished their first year together, and just so they could enjoy the feel of each other’s bodies, the feel of her smooth, silky, pale skin, the feel of her sweet, warm lips on him, the sight of her soft body against him, the feel of her tongue licking at his lips, the sight of his cock as it moved in her tight hole, the sight of his cum spurting out of his cock, deep into her body, into her body, inside her, and into her, and into her, and into her, and into her, they thought. But they had only just begun their second year together and that was just so they could enjoy each other’s bodies together, to enjoy the feel of each other’s hot bodies, and for her at that moment in which they were both just so hot that they could feel each other’s heat, feeling each other’s arousal, their desire, the heat, their need, the want, and then, just so they could indulge each other’s naked bodies, and to feel each other’s warm bodies on their burning bodies: they were going to do so again.</p> <p>There would be no need for anything else to decide their next year’s adventure.</p> <p>It always felt good for all of them to spend the night with their lovers, with each other, for both of them, in the beautiful bed each of them was feeling. It always felt good for all of them to feel like this: each of them feeling a pleasure for themselves. Each of each of them feeling a pleasure for the others, but not being able to experience that full feeling of being together, with a lover at the other’s side of the bed, a man who felt too good for just one, a man who couldn’t stop himself from feeling this way, of feeling this whole night.</p> <p>Each of them feeling so good for the other that they could feel such pleasure, each feeling so pleasure, each feeling so much pleasure.</p> <p>Both of them feeling so good with their sex.</p> <p>It didn’t surprise either of them to know about each other, but there would be a little more to be told. Sometimes it was just like that old film where the lovers are watching each other, sometimes like that one did, they watched each other while they made love, they watched each other with a partner. Sometimes two men together, sometimes at the same time, sometimes both together. Sometimes both together. But both men’s bodies were like that: they were so good to feel, so ready, so tight, the heat and feel of the others, feeling each other’s hard cock moving inside each other’s bodies, feeling the pleasure of a hard cock moving in and out of their bodies and between them, the feeling of two men together, touching each others bodies, feeling one man rubbing himself off against the other one, the two men feeling each other’s hard, hard cock against the opposite’s as they lay together.</p> <p>Sometimes their bodies were like that with each other. Sometimes they felt their bodies moving, their cock rubbing against others bodies. It did indeed make them feel so good, their bodies feel so good together again.</p> <p>Of course, sometimes, in spite of their bodies being so perfect, the other men’ cocks or their bodies doing something, or feeling something, they felt another way in their relationship with each other.</p> <p>Sometimes, between them, there was a feeling of excitement, of love for each other. Sometimes the other men felt excitement for the other man or woman who was fucking them. Sometimes, it was a feeling of excitement with both men and women, knowing that the other men knew the other men was there and that there was no one else who would know it but them. Sometimes they got so excited by the other men’ cocks and by their bodies and their hard bodies, feeling them in their bodies against them, touching each other men’ cock, touching others hands, their own bodies, feeling their own bodies against whom they are touching, touching themselves.</p> <p></p> <p>some of which they could be true.
