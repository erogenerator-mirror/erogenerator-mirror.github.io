Inanimate things, as a Church, an Hospital, a Bridge, may be Personated by a Rector, Master, or Overseer.</strong> You can't have the same thing, either. People are not objects, their reality can't make any difference. That's how I wanted this, was to be myself, as "the object of your affections" and "your lust".</p> <p>The idea for me to use my body and face in this story just might make up for all the other things I should have read the first time. The other stuff, however, I was going to leave open. In fact, I don't think I needed to read the first time anymore to just enjoy myself. I just had to read, get myself together, and think this story. So, I have my own little story firstâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
