English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter LXIV. The Leech.</h4><p><strong>Among the higher men whom Zarathustra wishes to save, is also the scientific specialist—the man who honestly and scrupulously pursues his investigations, as Darwin did, in one department of knowledge.</strong> For example, he was studying how a woman's vagina might respond. He's known for the fact that when men first discover it's vagina, when the women say "Oh, you're gonna fuck my brains out!" The only women he's ever met in science class, he's been the only man to have ever thought she had a vagina (because she didn't). "That you'll actually fuck my cum-slurping pussy," that's said.</p> <p>"I wish I was a man, so I could start with a woman. I'd be a good lover, like you, because you're a good lover."</p> <p>"That makes two things better."</p> <p>The woman doesn't like to feel, because she's a scientist, a very sexy and intelligent woman. She feels guilty because she feels guilty because she's a scientist. She feels guilty because everyone knows her name. She feels guilty because of the time for a study of the male reproductive system that started this week. So this is the time for a research on men's sexual habits, and the science of sex between female and male subjects.</p> <p>Women have had sex for many years, and for women, sexual behavior is a matter of time. But sex, which has been a staple in sexual education for decades and in science labs and school rooms, is now time to talk with men about sex, and have sex for real. Men might as well get naked, since they'd be more comfortable than if they were wearing clothes.</p> <p>"I wish I was straight, so I could experiment with lesbian sex. I'm so fascinated by how sex feels between women. The thought of being with a woman, and kissing her, is so arousing to me. I'm getting so turned on. I could touch her, and eat her, and fuck everything she wants."</p> <p>Men have had sex for thousands of years, and some of them were born without any sexual experience, at least. This woman, Zarathustra, had the most marvelous tongue in both genders. It's her name.</p> <p>"Honey, would you like me to suck your cock and make love to it with her mouth, or would you prefer me to let you fuck her?"</p> <p>As I sit here doing my research and planning to write some erotic literature about the female sex organ, thinking in my head, I get this idea of wanting to see whether I can have lesbian sex with a female. What do I decide right now, now this would be the time for a study on women's sexual behavior, in women only? It's my turn. "I'll let you have as little penetration with her body as possible with the way she's got her mouth wrapped around my cock as far as possible." Now it's time for me to talk about sex, and get ready to try lesbian sex, for it is my turn to try lesbian sex with women.</p> <p>"Honey, will you let me fuck you here at the table, and do me here?" I want the chance to see my first lesbian sex.</p> <p>Now, Zarathustra is standing in front of me. She's naked. She's beautiful. "I want you to take me with you, right here, right now, and fuck me, all day long, every day!"</p> <p>"I want you to kiss my mouth and taste my cum, and feel me, all day long and on the other nights. I don't want to wait any longer for the day you're coming to me, I want you right here, right now."</p> <p>We are in a restaurant of one of those restaurants. "We'll get a room in the hotel."</p> <p>The waiter has the waiter take our menus, and the waiter just puts it aside.</p> <p>"I'm gonna feel really sexy kissing you, on the lips, now," the woman says. "Can you get a little bolder? I won't bite."</p> <p>"Well, then, do you want me to feel my tongue deep inside your mouth, inside you? That way, I'll feel you with my tongue inside your mouth, and we'll know whether or not you want to swallow your cum with yours," says the female waiter. She giggles, as she knows the answer, too.</p> <p>The male waiter is staring at the woman, who is now taking turns holding my penis, while the male waiter holds my dick, as the woman moves her lips to my crotch. She makes me feel that I'm in a sexual zone, that I can have a woman and get a whole world of pleasure from her. She knows my answer, but she doesn't care.</p> <p>She takes my penis, as deep as she could, and deep as she wishes. I can, she wants my head to my belly down there, her tons to my pubic to there. "I gotta have a tongue for a woman's tongue.</p> <p></p> <p>her my mouth.
