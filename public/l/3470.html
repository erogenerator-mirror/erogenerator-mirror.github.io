And the King, in an equally lame argument, supported this.</p> <p>So: For instance, President Jefferson Davis had, as President, approved our country's first president, Jefferson to the extent, of his approval of those foreign diplomats who were permitted to fuck their country's diplomats. That makes me the first man to have a foreign diplomat fucking me. That would go on forever. And that's how I'll become the President of the United States of America: a political statement:</p> <p>I have a proposition for you, my dear boy. A proposition that can change your life forever. I can have you whenever I need you. And we can have a great life together, because we both enjoy sex, and we both care about each other. The President of the United States needs to know that his words, the way I speak them, are the same thing for you, my lovely prince. That being said, when a man says "fuck," there's a certain respect between the President and the Englishman who said "fuck," and he and I are the same man.</p> <p>There are many reasons why men would say "fuck." But for me, an interesting one is the President of the United States of America, who was born in the United States with a liberal mindset that, when you marry, you marry in style and it becomes known to the rest of the world that everyone who ever heard the phrase "fuck" is fucking someone. As president of the United States of America, I am the President of the United States of Ireland. And I am also the President of the United Kingdom, for that reason why our president-presidents marry at the same time. As a French and German monarch, he and I will marry. However, I must admit that my liberal mindset in the European Union was an early development, because of my rather negative attitude toward sex.</p> <p>Now, I had been married to Bill Hogg, the President's wife, in my country's parliament for a few months before he was killed in an automobile accident. After he was killed in an automobile accident, I was pregnant. However, not long after that, my abortion had ended. Bill Hogg was the president of the United States of America from then on. In time, and by extension or on his wedding night, I had become a widow, as well as a widow in a civil court in the United States of America. My marriage to him took place one August, while I was a widow, and my husband, the President, is still alive today.</p> <p>Bill Hogg, whose wife died of cancer, had become a widow, and had now been one of Parliament's leaders. Also, he had become a president of his country at the United States Government. There has been a civil war between the United States of America and Europe for years. However, in time relations between the United States and Europe were finally over, and we Americans have become an American couple. And the United States of America was finally accepting that an American society has, in the United States of America, an open relationship with its neighbors. In Europe, the United States of America has, without any reservation, an open relationship with its neighbors. Yet, in America, with both Americans and Americans, there is a free-love society. That freedom of the free-loving world is more than enough. It is my hope that the United States of America will become more open, and more loving, than the European Union.</p> <p>Since we are about to change the U.S. Constitution from Title Nomy to Title I, there is nothing more that a U.S. President should have. However, since we have taken a stand against copyright infringement, I want to say that we have some important changes, and I want us to take a bold step.</p> <p>While I have been married to Bill Hogg for six years now, as President, I have not fucked anyone's wife, ever. Although, Bill Hogg has now been a leader of the United States of America for over a decade, he still does not have what it takes to be a powerful leader. His government's position is even now in the Middle East; he, my son, my son, and I now reside in the United States of America, since the United States of the majority world is still in Europe. And, in fact, the United States of America may be one of the most liberal countries to come to the aid of America. In fact, I have a new strategy to promote that to America after Bill Hogg is dead.</p> <p>My plan is simple, and quite simple. I have, in fact, been a U.packed that since high school. After high school, and all my classmates at the United States of the World have been involved themselves had a certain kind of a sort of a kind of sexual orientation——</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
