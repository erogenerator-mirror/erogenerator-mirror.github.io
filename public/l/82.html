Rider Haggard </h3><h4>CHAPTER XXI The Truth and the Temptation</h4><p><strong>Not that day but on the morrow Kallikrates asked audience of me. Learning that he was alone, I received him in my private chamber and bade him be seated. He</strong> did so without delay. We moved to our seats and I whispered for him to kiss. I wanted his tongue in my mouth and I pulled him down with me and our lips met. My cock sprang to hardness within seconds and we fell to the floor together.</p> <p>I looked away from him and began. I made it quick the only way I could for in the next minutes. I was about to have some pussy...I would have it later...after my own fingers had rubbed against and across hers and her clit. I wanted to make a mess of her panties too and have both of them in me. I wanted to lick her all over. I wanted to suckle at her pussy and be one with her juices.</p> <p>I wanted to make her cum.</p> <p>I made her sit in our chairs as I knelt beside her. My cock standing at half mast. I reached my hands around to her breast and I felt the softness of her body as I was caressing her. I rubbed my hand down her body.</p> <p>"I do not know, my hands cannot do this, but let him touch you." I whispered.</p> <p>"I do not feel a need to touch any man, if he does not want me. I only feel desire...lust is such an odd thing...so strong. I feel so strong and manly here..."</p> <p>In another life what did you know, you will never know?</p> <p>Her eyes opened and she looked at my body like a child asking what it was that you know.</p> <p>"I could look at this, you know. I am the first in a world where all the senses must be equal. I only feel pleasure and you are it, and the pleasures, are so unique and wonderful. So different, and you do not know, I do know." I said quietly.</p> <p>"Are you sure you can feel what it is, you feel pleasure yet not fear?" She asked slowly.</p> <p>"I do know, I feel that I am not of the same plane and yet I feel...satisfied. I will be like this for eternity..." I said.</p> <p>"I love that you love me." She whispered.</p> <p>"Yes, I love you...more than...but I love you nonetheless." I replied.</p> <p>She then opened her legs and moved her hips forward. I moved my fingers to her pussy and caressed her. I then opened her lips and moved fingers along her clit. I pushed them inside her cunt and moved them around. Her breathing was like the sounds she made. One thing about pussy, it is different than a woman's mouth. She was so soft and smooth.</p> <p>"I will tell you..." I said looking into her eyes, "what I like in a woman...when I love is love. I know what you like and feel what you want. And I do know what you are feeling." I said again, "...yes, of course, if I do not have to...but do not fear it..." I said.</p> <p>She was beautiful and erotic. I moved my fingers out to her pussy hole and touched it. The heat, the smell, the taste, even smell that she must have must of been that of a woman. I pulled away and said, "I do not care what you do...I do, not that and I will know and see what you do..."</p> <p>She laughed and took my hand, "Do not fear...what you do will be your own choice..." I added to her words...</p> <p>"But...but...I do not want the feeling...of your wetness...of my fingers...or yours..." She laughed as my fingers touched her pussy.</p> <p>"You want me too much..." I said to her.</p> <p>"No I love you...I do not want any more than you...but love only as much as I love you" She said to me.</p> <p>"No more...I want to feel something else..." I said.</p> <p>"Just say..." She said as she moved her hips forward and parted her legs.</p> <p>I moved my hand to her and slowly pushed into her cunt. In my mind I could picture it. It was tight...tight but not too tight. I pushed my fingers into her pussy...and her movements became deeper and shallower. I did not know whether I was hurting her or making her love me at the same time. But she pushed me out with her pelvic motion and let me find out which way I wanted to enter her. I touched her clitoris and felt her body give a wave of pleasure and I felt her body react to my touch.</p> <p>My other hand opened her lips and took the clitoris her labia, her labia and started to me on her clitoris. My mouth. I am her pussy and sucked it was soft, her clitoris her labia as my sucking on its loveâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
