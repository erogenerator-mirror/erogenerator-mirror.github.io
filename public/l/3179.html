And in the shade of the fig tree we'll be fucking.</p> <p>As in all my years in the United States of America, our fucking is over. Only, what the hell has got me in a hurry, now, to fuck? I've never fucked three men at once in a single day in my life, a time that includes living in a country with such a taboo, immoral, sexual conduct? Oh, my God! I forgot! I forgot that I should have brought the vibrator that I use to fuck myself with, you know, all the other fun we used to go naked around town on the weekends. If I don't fuck now, there's someone in the house who I think I'll want to fuck all the time. When I have a day and a night and a place to go without sex, I'll never fuck in any man's house again, even if it's still warm. Why can't I fuck now? I must fuck in my house. I need to wear a condom and I'm going to fuck someone else.</p> <p>Just as when it started with that man, it wasn't my husband that I was thinking about, now. Who's in charge here? Who's in charge of all of that? What the hell is this place? We'll be fucking! And what does it look like when we make love? Who's driving me? Who's fucking our asses?</p> <p>It's not that I don't enjoy being in a man's car. It's just that it's different every day. I do enjoy fucking and I'm sure that I'll enjoy fucking and sucking and loving fucking more and more. I don't know how we got to this point. I don't know what he does for money to keep his car. A woman who knows that his wife is a nymphomaniac should know that if she asks him, he'll tell her. I've never taken a lover there, though, a woman that I was in love with before I met him. I don't know if he had money either, but I'm sure going to take him somewhere that I'm sure will be fun.</p> <p>A woman who knows that if his wife asks you to fuck all the time, you can fuck while she's driving him around town. I've never taken any fucking at all with a stranger that I've never sucked, fondled and sucked another man before and I never will. I only have fantasies. I only have fantasies. Just as I'm dreaming that I'm going to do this with three strangers, my dreams are coming true for me someday.</p> <p>Now that you've been warned that I'm about to fuck, I'm going to tell you that I have more than three fantasies. I think you might also want know that I didn't have a sex dream, too. I've never enjoyed the night before the fucking that I've just done with my husband and with the man that I was going to have sex with. Not that I don't love him. I know that if you'll excuse me, I will have the car, I know that I'll have the car, I just can't believe we don't live in a marriage where we have to live, too. So you don't have to worry about me staying home, too. I love fucking. I love fucking with a man that I met when he came home from overseas for just a second. I love fucking with a guy that I met when I got married to a guy that I met at a bar when I was drunk, when my husband was out with some friends or whatever. I didn't like it when we were together before and I didn't like it when he was fucking me while we were fucking when I'm lying naked in his bed. I like fucking when I'm fucking in a man's bedroom, when any woman is on her knees and having a sex in this man's bed while his cock is inside me that my husband is fucking and making me suck his cock, while having sex with his friend's cock. I just never liked it before, too. And I love it when the second man of my life walks in my living room with his pants down around his ankles and is raping me in the ass as my husband is taking advantage of me getting all the sex he needs. I just hate it when men do that."</p> <p>"All three of you have had a woman. I guess you all think I'm going to fuck them all. But the man that you know and have had the car here is different. You and you're alone with two men is different. You'll see. I can leave first. Now that all right? Now, you're the car and I still here you'll see what you have the car andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
