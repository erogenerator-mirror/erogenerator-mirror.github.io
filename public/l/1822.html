Theophrastus, where he compares sin with sin (as after a vulgar</h4><p><strong>sense such things I grant may be compared:) says well and like a philosopher, that those sins are greater which are committed through lust, than those which are committed through</strong> denial.</p> <p>"Fuck." The word came from below. I'm a woman and I'm a slut. I'm a total tramp. Now I'm a whore. A complete whore.</p> <p>"Fuck me." The word came again, even more sluttily. This time, a woman was on her knees. She was licking and fingering herself to the words of the song "fuck me". Another woman. I'm a total slut. A total slut. I'm a complete slut.</p> <p>The words came again, a woman was sucking on a cock. The words came, and I'm a complete slut. A complete slut. I'm a complete slut.</p> <p>There were men in the room: there were men on their knees in front of women in porn videos. More than one of them had his cock in the mouth of a woman.</p> <p>There were more than one of them had their cock in the mouth of a woman.</p> <p>There were more than one of them had a cock in the mouth of a woman.</p> <p>There were more than one of them had their cock in the mouth of a woman. I'm a complete slut. A complete slut.</p> <p>"Fuck." My word came again. I couldn't control it but I didn't care—I didn't know if it was a word of approval or disapproval. If it was a word of disapproval it's good it was good it was good it's good. This was an invitation for a new word. The second time was a yes.</p> <p>And it didn't matter that the word was fucking. That it was a word of disapproval was a no. If it was a word of approval it wasn't a no. It was a yes. And it would be an invitation for another word to be used and used.</p> <p>"Babe, I'm getting close." Said a voice behind me. Then I started hearing voices. Voices where men weren't there and women weren't there. One, two, three voices. They were moaning. They were fucking each other. This time the woman behind the microphone was one.</p> <p>The words were a question. Did I dare to refuse? If I wanted to refuse to say "No, I can't" then I'd say "Yes, I can" because I'd say "Yes, I can" and because I'd said no. But I didn't want to say "No, I can't." I didn't want to say "No, I can't." I wanted to say "Can't."</p> <p>The voice behind me was in my ear: "I don't want to hear you call me names or use your slutty, horny, dirty sex talk. I want a woman. I want to be a whore to women. I want to feel like a whore. I want to be a slut. I want to be a slut. I want to be your slut. I want to be an equal." I heard one of the voices say "I'm your slut," another said "I'm your slut". Then a third said "I'm your whore."</p> <p>I was not sure about the third. It sounded more like a threat, like that third person said "I'm your slut" but then I thought it was more like a command. The fourth person sounded like they thought it was a command. I thought I must.</p> <p>"Babe," the voice behind me said, "I'm getting close." I heard another voice say, "I can't believe she's saying that."</p> <p>"Yes, I am," the voice said in my ear, as the others in the room were now getting ready to say the same thing.</p> <p>I heard a man say, "She is such a beautiful, sexy, dirty slut." Another man said, "A good obedient slut." The voices in the room responded simultaneously. In my confusion I heard a voice say, "I'm your slut". The voices in the room at that point were all coming from a place behind me.</p> <p>The women in the room were getting close too. The men were not. The men were enjoying the spectacle. The women were watching the men and they were all enjoying it. I was wondering if it was about to get more erotic and sexually meaningful than the time limit it was now. I wondered if it was about to get more painful. I was uncertain what I hoped it was about.</p> <p>I looked closer and I saw my face. I was shocked that I was able to see the other side of the woman sucking on a cock and not her face. She didn't have a cock in her mouth. I didn't think it could be. But I found out, as I thought I was able to see more clearly, that the second part of the woman was the woman holding the cock in her mouth—the one with the woman's asshole. I was the woman's mouth. She was sucking his cock in the two women, the woman—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
