English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter XXIII. The Child with the Mirror.</h4><p><strong>Nietzsche tells us here, in a poetical form, how deeply grieved he was by the manifold misinterpretations and misunderstandings which were becoming rife concerning his publications. He does not recognise</strong> them in any meaningful form from the time period in which he wrote his book, "Deuteronomy, by Lying in the Forest."</p> <p>But it was an effective form to write the very lines which inspired him in the story, "Happily Ever Upon Earth", and hence the title. The poem's name is: Happily Waking Earth by Lying in the Forest.</p> <p>'And it is I myself from the very moment that my dear friend, my love and sweet heart, I awaken in this very place.'</p> <p>As he lay beside her on the couch reading the poem, his eyes wandered all over her, looking into the softness of her face and feeling her hands in his. After a while she moved closer to him. It's a lovely feeling to be loved, and her kisses were like paradise. There were tender kisses and full lingual kisses, the taste of her in his mouth, but they also had the wonderful texture of the sweet, sweaty, fleshy juices all over them. Her nipples were erect against his skin, and he could feel the throbbing of her cunt against him through his trousers. It was not a quick love, but the moment as a real passionate coupling.</p> <p>He felt her lips part and she took his cock in her mouth, sucking it gently, stroking it with her lips, teeth and tongue. He was in heaven, and was feeling proud of himself as much as of her. She let him fuck her mouth, and she held his balls in her hand; it felt as if they were one whole, so warm and soft and pliant. He was loving how she sucked him, too. He would tell her later, but to his amazement, she continued: 'My sweet darling man, your lovely cock tastes so good.'</p> <p>He would have let his hands move inside her top and caress her, but his hand was still trapped by his trousers, and he looked in horror at the tent in the front of her suit. It was bulging out at the front, and he was afraid that he was going to have a heart attack inside. He didn't notice.</p> <p>Sonia was still sucking him, moving her mouth up and down vigorously with his cock in her mouth. Her fingers were now sliding all over the insides of his thighs and calves without quite being able to reach his balls. Her touch was exciting him. She kept on doing this, and all around, as if she was masturbating him to his last orgasm. He felt his heart pounding in his ears and his breathing quickening. He could feel the muscles of his thighs clamped with the tightness of her mouth, but still not reaching his penis head.</p> <p>Her tongue was licking all round the head of his penis and he could not stop breathing with delight. She was smiling up at him, but his face was screwed up in pleasure. He was feeling even more excited, because of her, and he loved every moment of it. He was on the brink of coming very near, and he tried to hold back, but he felt that he was going to cum. After a while he pulled away from her, and said:</p> <p>'Sonia, you're not too bad; really you are. You know my ejaculation is probably already imminent.'</p> <p>She smiled back, and said:</p> <p>'It's probably already close, so it's not the time or the place to let it out to explode.'</p> <p>She was now lying on the couch, and her legs were wide apart, giving him full view of her cunt, which was still wet. It was open and swollen. He could see she had a bush of pubic hair, which she kept neatly trimmed into a short, soft triangle. It made his body feel a little strange. Then he looked at her; she looked down at him, smiled and said:</p> <p>'I thought you had to be careful about me seeing you naked,' then kissing him on the mouth, she murmured:</p> <p>'Don't think too much about me. I'm naked too, and I look even better than naked.'</p> <p>She was pleased to add:</p> <p>'Of course I do, you are too.'</p> <p>She leaned over and kissed him on the mouth again, rubbing her breasts against his chest. He felt she was looking at him directly, and he felt his cock twitching inside his trousers. He felt her hands inside the top of his trousers. She rubbed his chest over his turtleneck, and looked at him.</p> <p>'Do you feel like you're going to come all over my hands?' she asked, smiling.</p> <p>'No, I don't think I can keep up my promise, as I must.' and still feeling that her warm hands on him, he replied softly: . She smiled with pride inside the top of the trew her blouse, caressing his lower, and lower, and upper chest inside the trousers.
