English by Fyodor Dostoyevsky </h3><h4>CHAPTER III</h4><p><strong>“Pyotr Petrovitch,” she cried, “protect me... you at least! Make this foolish woman understand that she can’t behave like this to a lady in misfortune... that there is a law</strong> unto thyself... to protect me!”</p> <p>“Awe,” I whispered, “that’s not why you’re so nervous... you have a funny feeling in your brain that you don’t really really know what you’re feeling...” He teased, “don’t worry,” he said as he slid his body onto hers, “this is the place where I will make you feel the happiest woman alive!”</p> <p>She looked up at him, startled for a moment, and then smiled down at him so that she didn’t break the spell that I was cast. Slowly she rose to her knees. In the process of this she had moved the thin strip of fabric over her nipples. They were already erect and seemed to point to the stars. Her eyes met mine. I had a smile on my face... I had a very funny feeling in my stomach.</p> <p>He gently rubbed the very tip of his rock-hard cock against her body. I could see the tension in her body and wondered if she felt the same. He then placed a kiss on her ear, moving slightly higher and lower until his hands were caressing her breasts through the thin material of her bra. I watched him kiss her earlobe; her chest rose and fell with her breathing. Then she whispered, “Do you… think this can actually happen… now...”</p> <p>“Do you know where I can find the best privacy booth?” He asked as he kissed her ear, “You’re in the corner right next to the window.”</p> <p>“And you’ll only get a show or a blow job if I tell you to come with me...” she whispered seductively.</p> <p>“I suppose I could,” he teased back, as he squeezed her breasts in his hands, “but I can’t tell what I can get a girl for... ”</p> <p>“I’m going to blow you this time,” she said as she wrapped her lips around the tip of his cock. She began to bob up and down on it as she continued to speak. I watched as my lover's cock disappeared into her mouth. Her lips slid up and down his shaft while her tongue played against the underside. His balls smacked against the roof of her mouth. Her hands clutched at his hips as she sucked and licked him.</p> <p>Within a few moments of our lips touching and his shaft buried in her mouth I had my own little orgasm of pure bliss. I felt myself almost lose control as the pleasure in my body grew and radiated out from my body, out around her mouth and down into the depths of my vagina. As soon as my orgasm subsided I began to realize the risk of being caught.</p> <p>“If I get caught I’ll go straight back to bed,” I tried to say as I began to walk away. “But if you want to… you could come back... now before I get up—”</p> <p>“I want you to go right back to bed... now...” he repeated.</p> <p>“But I want you to go right back…” I said as I turned my back on him.</p> <p>Before I could reply he picked up a pillow from the bed and slowly pushed it up to my lips.</p> <p>“Now open them…” he said as he spread my legs gently as he slid his hands up and down my thighs.</p> <p>“If I open them… then it is no one’s business if I feel the pleasure in a hand touching my inner thighs while I am sucking you off or making love.”</p> <p>“Okay… I understand...”</p> <p>I couldn’t understand my heart racing, my hands sweating, but I wasn’t in trouble. I could see myself in the mirror... on the bed. My beautiful lover lying before me... my lover’s beautiful cock buried in his lover’s fist. My pussy felt as if it had a million nerve nerves standing up. I could only imagine what it was going to feel like.</p> <p>His cock was already dripping with pre-cum as he rubbed his cock around the outside of my vagina. I was now totally aware that he was moving his legs as he rubbed the tip of his cock against my clit. My breathing began to get short as I closed my eyes and leaned my head back against his shoulder. I could feel as he took my neck with his mouth. He placed the pillow over my breasts… I imagined them and gently sucked them. His mouth his mouth on my nipples.</p> <p></p> <p>’s hands were my breasts his mouth I had no mouth on breasts he was kissing my nipples. his lips on my nipples—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
