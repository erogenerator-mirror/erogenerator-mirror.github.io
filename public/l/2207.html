There is but one light of the sun, though it be intercepted by</h4><p><strong>walls and mountains, and other thousand objects. There is but one common substance of the whole world, though it be concluded and restrained into several different bodies, in number infinite.</strong> For all the times that we fuck, I know, there is only one thing you would call fuck, a man-pussy-hole, and I can assure you, no more. However, you can do both without the risk of it being unpleasant.</p> <p>I was on the bed, naked. You came to me, but you knew where I lived. You knew that I would sleep on top of you, that I would fuck you, fuck you hard. You knew that we would stay in this spot forever, that we would be fucking, fucking for eternity. You know that we would be fucking in every way. All that fucking, all those moments of lustful love and intimacy will never end. All that fucking, all those hours of passion, those moments of tenderness and love are ours. You knew how I will act with every single part of our bodies. I'll fuck you all day.</p> <p>I took your hand, led you out into your garden, the cool autumn air caressing your body. You watched as your man-pussy-hole slowly emerged from inside of me. Our bodies melted in a moment of total happiness. When we finally broke apart, I looked into your eyes. I was ready. I was ready to fuck you at last.</p> <p>I love you, and I'm ready to fuck you. I'm ready to fuck the shit out of you, as will my son. But I can also get away without having to go back home. The house you live in, my home, it is no more. You know that I love that house. The house, the little house, the place that I've built for you.</p> <p>I was sitting on the porch, watching the rain. It was a beautiful afternoon, with the light of many stars on the horizon. You're gone. There was no sign from around the house, even though the rain was getting a bit warmer. The last thing you saw on our drive to your house was a picture. I can always picture it with the man that I'm going to fuck next week, next week, this week, every hour of the hour of course, every weekend. I can picture the man that the woman I'm going to marry, the woman who will bear my child with him. And it is a beautiful picture that I will never forget.</p> <p>Your picture is the only memory which I'll always have. It's something that I will never forget. And the thought of it makes me hard, makes me wet. I just know that I want to fuck you now, I want to fuck you hard and fill your pussy with my life.</p> <p>"Honey!" I said. You looked at me with lust in your eyes. "I'll fuck you."</p> <p>Your body was ready, your pussy is ready, you're ready. You could go anywhere. I didn't want to give you that choice, either. It took me a moment to think about it. All that I've done, all that I want to do, that I want to do, I want to use and abuse you. I wanted to get out of this city, to go to my home and live in peace, to have you. But now I was going to live. I wanted to put my body to work, to become you.</p> <p>You could have stood there like a statue. As you were leaning on the wall, arms akimbo, you could have stood there holding your body. And if you had walked away from that picture, you could have had the first opportunity you'd ever had to come to my bedroom, right now, and be alone with you.</p> <p>I knew that I had to know what you were thinking. I could see your mind working. A woman's mind works, and is not a passive bystander. It can be used by women. A man's mind is powerful, and it can be used for a woman's body. The only woman I know, and could have had the pleasure of, is you. But instead you are one person with a very strong mind. What a woman's mind is like, is more sexual about thinking while I'm fucking her.</p> <p>You could never be without a man. I could never have sex without having it with you. It would never happen if you never left the apartment. I loved you very, very much. I had to make sure that I never went back to my apartment without you.</p> <p>"Let me suck your fucking cock, my manpussy-hole, my love-hole."</p> <p>I pulled you against me, our bodies moving together and enjoying the moment. I pulled you to me, and I wrapped my arms around you, one hand cupping your lovely round breast, the other one squeezing and was caressing the nipple, squeezing it. I lus. you, caressing, caressing you, my hands roaming you. Heaving you, caressing you. This is our bodiesâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
