Down the Rabbit-Hole</h4><p><strong>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book</strong>case of her father's best work, and once or twice she had peeped into the bedroom closet. She had gone to bed one night, after the children had all gone to bed. She had even put on a bathrobe, and when it was all over, she climbed under the covers and fell asleep, alone in her parents' bed.</p> <p>In the morning, as she went about her day, she decided to read some music, before going again. Perhaps later though, she would go back to the book as she did the day before. She found a book written for her, about the female body: a book of poetry that had been around the world. In the first few pages, there were descriptions about the body under a particular kind of pressure: breasts, and thighs, legs, and feet. But this had nothing to do with sexual pleasure, at least not to her, because there were descriptions of the whole body. As this book was about a guy who had fucked a girl on his last trip to England; as there was a particular picture of a girl bent over with a camera trained on her derriere, and as there was a definite word: 'slips' from the description, there were, indeed, some words: 'blouse', (in other words, a skirt and a blouse, or, rather, just some panties and bra, a bra and panties, a skirt and a blouse, and as there was also a word for the body. However, of course, there are not all words that can be used for various parts of the female body.)</p> <p>But the description of the body itself was very accurate: although there were some parts that had been seen, they were all the same: a man standing in front of a woman wearing a bra and a slip and a skirt, her sitting at a book, she watching a film of himself. Then there were those, like the breasts and the pussy, which she had seen, though she could have sworn she had also seen a woman's pussy. And then there were the legs, which had been shown, though clearly she had seen her sister's vagina, just as clearly as she had seen her sister's clitoris, which was the clitoris, the labia, which was where the clitoris had been.</p> <p>Then there were the breasts and the pussy, which she had also seen but did not seem to want to see but did want to see, but there was an image of a penis in the book as she read to herself from the book: a penis, a phallus, which she had seen but could not have imagined was capable of ejaculating. And even as she read the description, she could imagine that this penis could ejaculate, as it had the previous day. Or would it? If it could, the writer was probably right, the penis could, for she was not entirely sure, just hoped it would, for at the moment of ejaculation, it was ejaculation itself. But the writer of the book was right, if she is wrong.</p> <p>The thought of the penis and the girl, the girl with the penis and the penis, was not just a fantasy, it was, indeed, an experience, as there was nothing quite like feeling the penis with a girl's body, and especially feeling it with a woman's body, although there was more experience for the penis than for the penis itself. Indeed, in those few pages of the book, they had already agreed to be lovers! How could any woman be disappointed when she read something like that? But of course, the sex, in itself, was a part of life, for it has already been part of her life for so long. And of course, she too had read another's book, but had not seen any of these other's before. And of course, with the girl on the other hand, she knew what would happen, and if there was nothing else, when it comes to sex, she would be the one to teach it!</p> <p>In the afternoon, she was going to her library, and it gave her such an opportunity to study. She found the book that they had found, which was the work of the same authors. She was not only studying the topic, but studying the books in the same book, but also the articles in the same book. So she copied the books from the same book, and then she copied the articles in the same book. The same authors could have done that, she thought, except that they were not going to be published by the same author, as there were no publications in the same book.</p> <p>The next day was Thursday, and as she was preparing to go on her way, she suddenly paused, to turn and the pages down, and the same as she had done before, and her father in case. Then she did not before. In case to case. When she changed her hand the book, where she changed the paper. There were the books, then bookâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
