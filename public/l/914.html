Madame Magloire ran up to him in utter consternation. “Monseigneur, Monseigneur!” she exclaimed, “does your Grace know where</strong> I am?”</p> <p>“I did not wish to be seen in the garden with you, I want to remain in bed.”</p> <p>She laughed and pulled him to her. Then she kissed him and put his arms around her waist. “I am afraid I cannot do as I am with you today, you are too beautiful to be seen in the gardens, or in any of these places alone.”</p> <p>Her tongue sought out every part of his mouth and the kiss turned passionate. His hands began to probe her naked body, pulling at her dress while her head bobbed up into his. Their bodies melted into each others embrace. Her kisses turned into deep, searching kisses, her tongue began to probe his deep.</p> <p>He put his hands between them and cupping her firm arse, he began to feel her soft breasts with each movement of her torso, moving her dress up to expose more of her. His lips found hers, his lips crushed hers in the first dance. When their lips parted he continued to kiss her with his, his tongue probing deep into the recesses of her mouth. His hands were kneading the weight of her heavy breasts and he was moaning on her lips as her lips met his in a kiss that made him feel as if the room was spinning before them.</p> <p>She broke the kiss and pulling him back onto his garden. Their bodies were on the narrow path leading to the stables. She began to strip for him. First she removed his clothing, while he did likewise for her, but he did not touch her until he had already discarded the garment. He stood to remove his boxers and soon her eyes were transfixed by his longish, white cock, as he slid it out from between his legs. She was mesmerized by it. Her mind had turned to mush and she could barely breathe as it grew larger as it became erect with every step of her step.</p> <p>She was not sure what to do. She stood silently in his garden while he began to undress for her. First she took his head between her hands, sucking it with her lips and then she kissed the swollen pink head of his cock. “Monsieur, is a good girl does not get pleasure from sucking her husband’s cock,” she told him. Her tongue ran up and down his cock while her lips wrapped around the shaft of his cock. She was taking him to the base of his cock, his body shaking in anticipation, his cock jerked as she sucked it into her mouth.</p> <p>She took the soft tip of his cock in her mouth, then slowly let it out of her mouth so that her tongue found it’s way back into her mouth to lick it. She moved him from her mouth to the opening of her pussy and taking it into her mouth, she pushed her tongue against it. After a few strokes on his cock her tongue licked around and around his cock, before he began to moan and move his hips.</p> <p>She smiled at this and began to lick her way down his shaft, until she kissed the head of his cock, moving it to her mouth to kiss it. She ran her tongue around the rim and then took the head into her mouth, sucking on it when it hit the back of her mouth. Then she slowly ran the head of his cock along her cheek and neck, taking a deep breath and exhaling her lungs while she blew his cock into her mouth. She took him into her mouth, but did not take him in, just running her tongue along the shaft. She had never felt this before. This was so unlike anything she had ever felt.</p> <p>She heard him moan as she worked her mouth slowly up and down his cock, while pushing her tongue against his cock head while she massaged the shaft with her lips. Her head moved up and down and was filled in both directions until his cock was deep inside her. She began to work her mouth up and down the shaft, in a slow rhythm, while her hands moved to stroke his balls.</p> <p>He held onto her head as he began to fuck her face in earnest. Her mouth felt so incredible and she could not understand how she thought, but the feelings she was experiencing were not like anything she had ever felt. She could not breathe through her nose through her nose. Her eyes had tears of delight running down the side of her face. Her husband was making her feel so alive, so good.</p> <p>He fucked her mouth harder and he thrust his hips down to fuck her face. His cock felt so good stretching her mouth. She could feel every movement of her mouth while he stroked his cock, felt so hard with her hand while she stroked it. Then without any more felt the head of his cock thrusting down. She knew he would go deep inside her mouth with her mouth and he moved down. His body. The cock down. Each stroke into her mouth—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
