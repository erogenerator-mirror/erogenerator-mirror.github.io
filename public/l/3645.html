When we got to the continent where he was visiting his parents for the first time, he had a pretty good idea what was and wasn't ready to be naked, so he decided to go naked just as we were. We ended up spending the entire night that I was in bed with him.</p> <p>We got to the bed that we were in, and he proceeded to lay my ass on a pillow and he entered me and took me and he fucked me. He fucked me until I screamed for him to fuck me again as I reached orgasmic release many times that first night. When he rolled off, I got up, pulled my panties back up and he saw my butt, his dick still standing erect. He turned me around and told me that he liked my butt and that he'd like to do that again.</p> <p>He turned me around again then bent over, spread my butt cheeks, ran his tongue along it, and then rimmed it again. He rimmed my anus for a while, lubed up his tongue with saliva, and tried to stick it in my ass. He pulled my anal ring apart, but not all the way open. I begged him to put it in, but he insisted on being gentle. That made it easier, but I'm sure that he couldn't imagine how it would feel to penetrate my ass with his cock.</p> <p>After about ten minutes of this, I was ready for another erection. I told him to get in the bed, and he rolled over so that I was on top with him. I rode him until I came again, then lay on top of him. I fucked him until he came once more, then lay on top again. We fucked some more then got dressed.</p> <p>Our parents went away for a month, then left, so we spent the week together. I had sex with my ex in the shower, him in the dining room and at the bar. Once I let him fuck me on the kitchen counter like some horny schoolgirl, but he didn't ask me if he could. He wanted to fuck me again and I wouldn't have let him. So we did the same thing at the end of the week, and we do it every weekend. Sometimes we do a two-week span of sexual intercourse. I like to try, but with it being a single-day trip between my ex and me, I can't get the same feeling of a normal weekend for two people.</p> <p>This time wasn't the end of our lives. It was our own. It was like we had done before each others lives happened. Our life was different enough that we didn't have to be happy about it anymore than we had to be happy with each other. It's hard to believe he was even there with us, but he was. It was as if we were just friends. We had known each other forever. It was like we had known each other for years. I'd been there for me. I'd been there for him. I made love every time. It was so good. I really do love being with him. That night, I had sex with every way to get him to want to fuck me. I had done it in the shower. I took my time getting ready for him. I wore my favorite little, sheer bra and panties that I'd bought for him. I had let him fuck my ass. He wanted to make love to me. I took the opportunity to wear that dress, although it had a really low scoop-neck and little in the front. It had only a split that stopped about two inches above my navel, so that my boobs could be barely covered. I looked so hot in it. I had just put on an extra little bit of lipstick, which would really give me that alluring effect that I know men love to have. I also wore a pair of black high-heeled pumps.</p> <p>I took the moment to give him a look at the look on my face when he went through the same routine, but it didn't seem as much like what everyone else had done for him. He got the same look that his ex would have given him. I knew how much he loved it when somebody else did it for him. It's just that I didn't want to put on that look for him. But, at the same time, the look of lust and love on his face was very sexy. I wasn't that way myself. My look was the same one that was always there for him when I got my butt spread. And that look was something I could put on for a different guy. It really worked for him too, and we were both glad that he would like it.</p> <p>And I knew exactly what it would do to him too.</p> <p>We spent the majority of the entire Christmas that year at my ex-seasons together. We had a little time together to learn how he knew he wanted something that nothing about us but I wanted everything we would.
