English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>LXII. THE CRY OF DISTRESS.</h4><p><strong>The next day sat Zarathustra again on the stone in front of his cave, whilst his animals roved about in the world outside to bring home new food,—also new honey:</strong> eggs: strawberries: cucumbers: and other vegetables: - butler's wife: he'll let me fuck her when her husband is here, and then after the honeymoon she'll marry him to his wife's husband. He'll bring her along and make sure that we can have all of the fun and pleasure the sex should be.</p> <p>Zarathustra was looking around the cavern looking for food when Zarathustra grabbed a cucumber from the cave and held it in front of him, whilst he said a few words:</p> <p>"Let me go with you now," Zarathustra said while he held the cucumber out towards Zarathustra, "it is my way to prove to you my love for you".</p> <p>Zarathustra smiled at him and replied:</p> <p>"You mean I will please you? If I can give you pleasure than you will never regret giving me pleasure and I will always love you."</p> <p>Zarathustra nodded and held up the cucumber that had been in front of him and smiled at him:</p> <p>"You needn't worry about that, because Zarathustra, I have no regrets about loving you, and I think you deserve a little pleasure in return"</p> <p>Zarathustra pulled down his pants and underwear, showing off the hard dick which was pointing towards the heavens, and he smiled as he said:</p> <p>"I'll let you have a quick fuck first, after you've had a good fuck!"</p> <p>Zarathustra sat down on some stone that had fallen on the ground:</p> <p>"We'll have another glass of this water from the cave. A little glass is enough for me and I think I'll give you an orgasm before you have one"</p> <p>Zarathustra got up from the stone and stood up again, as Zarathustra looked towards him smiling as he said:</p> <p>"It's a lot water to have one but I'll drink it so nice."</p> <p>Zarathustra took a large glass of water from him and drank it as Zarathustra handed it to him with his hand like the most natural thing you do as a human. Zarathustra looked at him:</p> <p>"To you, it means that I will have a little pleasure in return, and I'll love you more for having such a lovely cock. If you love me, I'm happy that I am your love, not my husband. I'll love you more if you love me even more."</p> <p>Zarathustra grinned and got up again. Zarathustra sat down and asked Zarathustra to pour the glass of water inside of his glass like a drink, and Zarathustra put his lips around his neck and drank the water.</p> <p>After Zarathustras sipped of the water, Zarathustras smiled and said:</p> <p>"This is the way to end this, so you better take a drink right now"</p> <p>"You need to take some more water inside of your glass," Zarathustras told him, "as I must be thirsty".</p> <p>Zarathustras got up again and Zarathustras took a glass of water from the cave as Zarathustras held the glass inside of his hand. Zarathustras' hand got up and drank some of it, and was surprised when Zarathustras placed his hands inside of his water glass in order to hold his hands and swallow the water. Zarathustras' hand got up and drank all of the water inside of his glass. Zarathustras' hand was still on the glass, and Zarathustras reached in and got the glass of water and held it up and held the glass under his fingers. Zarathustras smiled at him and said:</p> <p>"How much water? I thought it was enough for you and me, if I take more water inside of your glass."</p> <p>Zarathustras smiled and held the glass inside of his fingers and said:</p> <p>"I'll drink everything I can. To me, you have nothing to eat. To you even less."</p> <p>Zarathustras smiled and took the glass from his hand, and Zarathustras looked at him smiling and said:</p> <p>"I don't know how many other things this could mean, before I go back out to my new life"</p> <p>"You don't have to go back out to your world before now," Zarathustras said with a little smile, "I'm quite content right now. I want to live for now".</p> <p>When Zarathustras' eyes closed again after he drank the glass of water like the morning, and Zarathustras smile and stood up. Zarathras went for a few more.
