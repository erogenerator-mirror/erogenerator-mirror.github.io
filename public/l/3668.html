She had already sucked him off a hundred times before but this was the first time she was going to get to be fucked by another man. She was also going to have some difficulty as she was so sexually frustrated that her body would not handle the double penetration so easily. But she had the presence of mind to do it; the difficulty was quickly overcome by pride in her skills as a man and her body would be ready.</p> <p>As her sex-starved mother, she was well informed of the situation and the appropriate time of arrival.</p> <p>The afternoon's departure was a special occasion, with two women having sex for her father, her husband and to her absolute delight, her best friend, who was also attending the graduation of her future son in law to her son-in-law.</p> <p>The wedding was arranged by his brother, whose name she recognised from the news that she had received the wedding photograph. That was his mother-in-law, now that he was aware that his mother was not happy to visit with their family and that they would be taking a vacation to France to celebrate.</p> <p>He was a businessman; having won over the trade he and his brother had built, he had built a business on the Internet. His son-in-law at the outset had been the main target of his web operations but now that he had got her out of his sight, he had made it very obvious to his brother as long as the business had all the money and if, in fact, he had made it very clear once or twice to her that he was a bit of a greedy greedy boy. The business had been very well received, because the young lady who was invited to attend was now happily married and the son in law had been accepted as a member of the family.</p> <p>He had booked the hotel suite on his father's insistence and it had been quite clear that it would be the perfect venue for the three of them having sex.</p> <p>Her parents were both going to be there on the weekend so there was no need to dress properly in case things went sour.</p> <p>This would be the event he would be going to; the wedding to his favourite girl.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 4: A Wedding That Will Be the Best</p> <p>Anne's life had been quite short a couple of months before she left for England. The job at the hospital had provided her with some very valuable experience with women and she had grown fond of it as they became friends with a special respect, as a friend, of hers, her mother-in-law, the lovely, sweet, sexy Anne.</p> <p>Anne had never before been with a woman before in the presence of a man in her life and certainly only by sheer chance had she even dreamed about a woman so intimately intimately close to a man. She realised that she had no desire to enter into such a relationship as with the father of her son in law, but in reality, although it was a strange experience for her, the attraction that she could see was quite strong and it added something to the passion that she knew was there. And as it turned out, she was quite certain that she loved it. She was more than certain that her body just wanted a man to give her a good fuck.</p> <p>Anne's initial shock at the thought of fucking her husband had been replaced by her immediate satisfaction as she saw her husband's hard cock entering her body. She was just starting to be turned on by the sight of having this man's hard cock entering her and fucking the woman she loved so. Her immediate response was to throw herself onto her husband's hips, which she felt was his hard cock driving its hardness deeper in to her womanhood. As she clung to Anne who felt her first orgasm approaching, the image of her husband's manhood fucking her, the sight of it thrusting in and out of her body, the idea that she could actually be fucking and fucking her husband, her sexual arousal got more and more intense, despite her recent attempts to rationalise it. It became so real that, as Anne lay next to her husband with her hand gently massaging his rigid cock, she began to dream about the fantasy of fucking her husband.</p> <p>A few minutes later, Anne had been aware that she was being watched by her husband who had been watching them, and she felt embarrassed as she realised that her husband could now see her with her own image, a picture of a naked woman, standing before him that was now looking back as she lay next to him. She could feel the heat of her excitement growing, not only by the sight of their married woman, but also by the image of her friend that her husband had just been sporting. in case he was now making love.</p> <p>"love. for"love of "love me"love of"."
