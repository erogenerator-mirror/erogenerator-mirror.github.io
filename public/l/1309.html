Andrea Cavalcanti</h4><p><strong>The Count of Monte Cristo entered the adjoining room, which Baptistin had designated as the drawing-room, and found there a young man, of graceful demeanor and elegant appearance, who had</strong> just come from a long day of classes at Massas, his hair in an exotic pattern of blue. His eyes were a blue hue, too, and the dress shirt he was wearing was white.</p> <p>The young man stared at the beautiful man with dark brown eyes who was studying him very closely. He could not help but notice that he was much taller than the young man seated in front of him.</p> <p>He had to ask permission to enter the room from the front to enter the room, but he was still standing in front of the tall, well-built man. He realized that this wasn't the first time, in a more or less professional sense, the man had had sex with him. He had thought he had already made that up his mind, because, what the hell, it wouldn't matter anyway. This man had been married for a very long time, and even though it wasn't just his reputation that mattered, it was the feeling of being sexually involved with him from the first time that he had met him.</p> <p>"You like," said the voice, which belonged to Pastor Martin, one of his many aides when he was in a hurry.</p> <p>"Yes," said the young man, his face turning bright red. "I like." He turned around and hurriedly walked over to where the tall, handsome man sat, staring at him with a knowing smile. It was all the more beautiful to see that Pastor Martin was of Italian descent, and even though he seemed a little older, all of his face, like his hair, was of Italian descent, in a stylish manner.</p> <p>"How old are you?" asked a voice. The Pastor was dressed in a dark gray suit, with a dark blue cardigan. A single white blouse buttoned well above his cleavage, and a short, blue-colored skirt fell below his knees. He even had a stylish white button down shirt on. The Pastor was also wearing a pair of dark blue loafers.</p> <p>"I'm twenty one," said the Pastor, not wanting to make the man feel awkward, but instead just wanting the man to say the correct thing. "I have been married for a few years and can't get enough of you, but I wanted to do this today, since my parents are going to be out until tomorrow. I am going to the chapel after lunch." The Pastor put out his hand to the large, butler, John Mark, who helped with the room clean.</p> <p>"Good," said the Pastor. "I was afraid that you would want to talk. Do you really want to talk about what happened yesterday?"</p> <p>"I was really worried. If it's OK with you, I would like to talk. Would it be Ok?"</p> <p>"It may be, but you have to understand that my parents will be home again and won't be able to take me on board the way I wanted to go down from Mass to be with you. I really hope that you will find me appealing today," said the Pastor. "I have to help with all the arrangements, but I would love to continue to chat, but will you agree to let me talk alone with you?"</p> <p>"Of course, but it might be a while before we get back to you." When he spoke to him, he never called him that name.</p> <p>"We'd better be heading off of Mass now," said the Pastor. "I am sorry that I couldn't think of something to do with my day."</p> <p>"That's OK too. I have to finish taking care of my things today. I have classes tomorrow morning before Mass begins."</p> <p>"You have classes tomorrow."</p> <p>"Yes, I have."</p> <p>"Would you like to meet with me?" the Pastor asked. "Would you like to come home with me?"</p> <p>"Yes, of course I would," said the young man. "It would be nice to meet with you."</p> <p>In the meantime, Pastor Martin turned to the young man again and placed a kiss on his lips. The Pastor's hand came up, cupping the young man's lower jaw, and he lowered his lips slowly, seductively, kissing the young man lightly on the lips.</p> <p>When the Pastor's mouth left his lips, the tongue was at his ear. The Pastor's body was in shock, as if someone had just kissed him. He couldn't move. He was aghast. But also of confusion. He couldn't understand what happened. Was it the Pastor, or himself? Of course, it must have been, since he looked at the man and asked him, how was it that a young man felt so attracted to a woman? Butler? He was quite sure that the young men didn't know what was true of the answer to be.</p> <p>to her, the way to the way of her, she said. The way of her by means of.
