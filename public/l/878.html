It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the sum I</strong>'d ask. I feel in some strange way that you are at the wrong position to read that I want you and all of my thoughts have stopped. I wanted to be with you and it doesn't stop. You have opened that doorway into something of mine, I've had more opportunities than I'd care to now. I want you to be with me.</p> <p>My body is hard with anticipation of you at my side. I know I am dreaming just like my dream. My body is as a part of you. Your fingers touch the skin of both cheeks of my ass and I jump in my sleep as if I am in slow motion. Your lips press against the sensitive nub as your tongue probes between my lips. I love tasting you. I love kissing you. I want you. My heart pounds. I can't control it anymore. My mind wanders as I let my breath escape in a rapid succession. Every thought that comes into my head is with you.</p> <p>I feel the warm breath of your mouth on my cock. I know my cock is hard for you. You look up as if I am looking at you. Your brown eyes sparkle at me as you continue your assault on my skin. You look delicious and sexy as you smile and lick your lips again and again. You reach under your cheerleader skirt and tease me as you feel my cock rising. You smile in anticipation of my cock sliding into your cunt, your pussy, all of your flesh. I can't take it anymore.</p> <p>I need something for my ass to take. I have fantasized about feeling a girl's body on my cock. I want to see how pretty she really looks. I need you to fuck me. I want to be with you all night. I don't care what you are wearing or what you want from me. I am yours to do what you want, any time you want. I want you to be there when I take care of you, take care of you. You're my little boy toy to be used. I love to fuck you, I really do. I'll play with my butt when you're alone and have a hard time not shooting my load all over your pretty blonde angel. I'm gonna fuck your tight virgin ass real good and make you my little girl toy. You know I will because I know you'll be my little whore whenever I want to hear it.</p> <p>I feel like I'm in a dream, a real sexual dream and I know this is your first time. That is how I can wake up and know we are making love in our dreams instead. I feel your lips curl in a sexy smile as you watch me.</p> <p>You slowly run your fingers along my chest and across my nipple through the thin fabric of my shirt. You know what the real thing feels like on your body. You smile and your mouth opens slightly. You can see the wetness in my eyes as you slowly trace my flesh. I can't believe how much I want you. I'm not sure how I know, what I've felt in my dreams but I know it is the truth. As my nipples swell with your touch I feel so happy when you kiss them. My body reacts when you caress them but I enjoy every minute of it. I want to make love to you and be with you always.</p> <p>Your hands begin to move up my body and your touch is electric. You feel more and more of me. When your body presses to mine, you feel like you're going to explode on my flesh. Your wetness is all over me and I am ready to feel your hands all over me now. I can't believe you have me in your embrace, the world has changed. I want to wake up with you holding me in your arms and loving me. I am going to be your little whiny plaything forever. I love kissing you so much, kissing your lips, your face, your neck, your breasts. Sometimes you touch me and I can feel you in all my body. I know I'll love it if you touch me forever. I just have to know you and how to be with you.</p> <p>You look at me in my eyes and you smile, "I just made this up to take you away from the real world. You're such a doll," and you laugh. You put your arms around me and hold me to you. When you take a good look at me and I see you, so real it looks impossible, you are like an angel who's all your own. You hold me tightly as the passion builds inside of my chest. I can feel your desire, desire I need you to know it and I know you need me to know it. I look at your beautiful, so vulnerable, so desirable and ready, so eager, that my body so sexy. I need you need you. I want to feel so much in your touch you.</p> <p></p> <p>you pull away from me, I feel yourself, I—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
