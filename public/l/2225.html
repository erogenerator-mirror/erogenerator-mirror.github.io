There were plenty of men who liked sex, women wanted to fuck, women wanted to make love, and that's where it all went topsy and minnoop.</p> <p>Well, it wasn't all there was to my life that went by with my mind wandering. I still enjoyed sex, most of the time, but there was really nothing that did so much as get me thinking about my past relationship – and as a result I ended up getting laid by a lot of guys in my past and for the rest of my life I tried to get my way to a good one. And then there was this one guy. One day I was out with Mark when he came to me and took us into a nearby woods and fucked us both on a blanket in a warm area of the park. He was a little older than I was, only a year or two older – if it wasn't that old, he must be fucking his dad. And he was a good lover too. It was only a matter of time before I was going to spend the rest of my life getting fucked by his great-great-great-great-great-great-greats.</p> <p>I was having such thoughts that my pussy suddenly became moist and excited. I had to take it away from me so I could really enjoy myself, but I needed to go back and clean this up a bit before I masturbated and came. When I found the towel wrapped around my wrist some minutes later I decided to do something a bit more fun. I cleaned up my thoughts until I came to my own orgasm. I didn't even bother touching myself as that didn't seem to bother Mark at all. He didn't really notice me at all – he just gave me a gentle kiss and went for another dip.</p> <p>It was one of those moments where you just know you can always leave a mark if it feels good to you. Even though I knew it was only a matter of time before something would be done to me anyway it was just that. I still remember the feeling of being surrounded by Mark's gentle hands, knowing he had a plan in his mind. Maybe I would be a bit more than capable of doing this without having to do any of the work. Or maybe I would not be able to go through with this.</p> <p>When I opened my eyes and saw that a big part of what I was witnessing was in fact actually just for Mark's benefit (he was the one that made the effort for it). I quickly looked around me and started to wonder if it was really possible for him to be here as well from the very first of his life and maybe I should just tell him how I felt. Then I realized that I didn't really want to leave him if it was all over at this moment.</p> <p>I started to wonder if maybe it was going to hurt too much if he fucked just once more – how could they not know what the hell he was doing? Then it hit me. I was going to have sex with this guy, even though, frankly, it wasn't as though I wasn't already going to have sex, so I just decided to go for it. I had already made out with a couple guys in a bar and I would have sex with them. There was no way I would be fucking someone Mark cared very much about.</p> <p>And yet, there was. Mark wouldn't really want it to happen. And I wasn't sure, but I didn't care.</p> <p>I looked over at him – he looked a bit stunned by it all – and smiled. I wondered how he would react, looking around to see if there was anyone else that could read this part of my mind and perhaps he would have made an excuse about it, but he simply smiled at me. I don't think it was so bad that it was even that simple. After all, Mark would never make me suck another dick without an agreement from me about it, right?</p> <p>After a while I gave in. I looked at Mark and said, "You're so lucky to have a nice dick," and then leaned over to kiss him. "Thank you," I said. "You're welcome."</p> <p>And I started to kiss him again.</p> <p>Mark was surprised then and said, "Oh, my God, Jen. I've been waiting for this day forever." He didn't seem to be very surprised, and then he looked slightly disappointed when he saw the towel in my hand – what he had apparently done. "I can't believe you're doing this," he said.</p> <p>I told him I appreciated the compliment and then kissed him some more. "Jen, please," he said. "Just take your clothes off."</p> <p>I smiled a little and pulled my t-shirt up off, not so fast enough to get it on it's own. I got up to say what I had no bra that it was that was, I had on. I was that was it wasn't really a sports—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
