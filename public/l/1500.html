When the song ended, the queen smiled to herself at how the two of them made a handsome couple.</p> <p>Now, a month hence, on spring break, their friends were in Germany and the two girls in their swimwear were making their way to Paris. As a matter of fact, they were already in the air, so when Laura walked into the room all was still, and they just stared at each other. They were so much in love, and knew that even though it was only the two of them, they were meant to be. She walked over to him, and put her arms around his neck. Her soft body began to sway with his every step, and he could feel her breasts pressed against him.</p> <p>"I love you," he whispered in her ear.</p> <p>He walked her to the back door, and closed it tightly behind them. He kissed her neck then and whispered, "I love you," before taking the back of her dress and letting it fall to the floor. His hands began to roam all over her body as he kissed her deeply. Her dress came to her waist just above her waist while he reached under her to remove her lace underwear. Her breasts spilled out into the open, and he lowered his mouth to kiss her nipples.</p> <p>Laura put her arms around his neck while he kissed her breasts. He reached down and began to remove her shoes while she slowly lowered the laces on his dress shirt while he undid her dress and removed it completely. As his pants came off, Laura could feel his erect cock against the soft fabric of the underwear. He took her back to the bedroom.</p> <p>He turned her around and started kissing her while he unbuttoned her dress shirt. She pulled it off and tossed it onto the floor, then followed with her clothing. He knelt before her. Her breasts were perfect and so enticing that he reached down to gently kiss them, and then he slid his hands up her sides and onto her breasts and massaged her beautiful globes.</p> <p>"I love you," he whispered to her in a low sultry voice while he kissed her nipples. She could feel his stiff member pressing against the fabric of his underwear. He slid her underwear down enough so that he could see the shape of her mound, and she could smell the perfume of her arousal. He reached out his hand and slid his fingers down the outside of her panties.</p> <p>She loved when he touched her there. She lifted her hips and he slid his underwear down to free her. They stood naked in front of each other. She could feel the fabric of her underwear with her fingers, and he ran his finger down the outline of her pussy lips.</p> <p>"I can't wait to try fucking you," he whispered in her ear. Laura's heart melted but her body was still turned on from their first night together, and she knew that she shouldn't wait much longer. They were just going to have to find out how it felt.</p> <p>"It's been a month since I let anyone else into my private orifice," she whispered as she slid off her panties and stood in front of him. He kissed her and took her into his arms. Their mouths met in a hungry kiss, and the smell of their bodies aroused each other like no one else's. Laura felt herself growing wetter as she held him close, and felt his erection against her.</p> <p>Laura pulled him towards the bed and they collapsed on it. They kissed hungrily while they continued to explore each others bodies. She felt his lips trail down and over her breasts and her nipples pressed against his tongue. She rolled on top of him in his arms, and slowly slid herself down until his cock was pressed against her. He felt the dampness between her legs on his rod, and knew that this was his chance to show her just what he could do.</p> <p>"I want you," he whispered in her ear while he lowered his mouth to her breast. Her heart beat wildly in her chest as her pussy dripped with excitement. "Tell me how it feels when I do that," he whispered in her neck while he began kissing her nipples again.</p> <p>"It feels so good," she cried, and kissed down his body. She kissed and licked the entire area around his cock. She loved when she tasted a little pre-cum that had built up in his balls, and she loved it when he could stay in her mouth all night. He felt himself begin to pulse as she slid her mouth across the head of his cock.</p> <p>She loved the taste and felt the excitement of having his cock in her mouth earlier in the week. She let him fill her mouth up, and he could feel her warm, slick tongue circling the sensitive head of his dick. The thought he was close to cum soon. He could not believe it, because she could not be feeling his cock, she had never cumming would only a little waves of his dick wasâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
