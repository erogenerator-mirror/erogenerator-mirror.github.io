English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter XLVII. Involuntary Bliss.</h4><p><strong>This, like “The Wanderer”, is one of the many introspective passages in the work, and is full of innuendos and hints as to the Nietzschean outlook on life.</strong> The lyrics from the song, “Nude, Sweeping Away (from “The Stripper in the Dancehall,” are for you, and you’ll be in the midst of your own music,” are an inspiring example for me to keep in mind.</p> <p>Many of these passages are sung in homage to “The Wanderer”, in the sense of the lyrics:</p> <p>When we were a young lad; I used a special “bount the bird” spell on your head. And while I was not supposed to be near you; it was the only thing that could bring me up. At the very least, I had to rely upon my senses to find the object of my attention.</p> <p>By the time I turned sixteen I was quite used to it, and even thought I was old; my ears, nose, chin, and neck had begun to ache, but I could never quite get the itch back. And once I became a full-fledged scholar, I was given a special treat by my professors at a state university that required a special kind of study to be able to study the very essence of the human body (it just seems like a waste of time), so it could be used by both sexes and even by some other groups of people. The Professor’s own student body was so tight and loose that the only thing I could think about before the class was the itch between my legs, which had been ignored by me, to begin to get my panties moist. I knew this “speciality” very well, as I knew even more about that particular subject than I did at school; at least I knew it then.</p> <p>We were sitting around talking about some matter that I knew nothing about. That subject was about sex, which was all the more important to me since my first year of college. My husband was not going to make a habit of having the discussion with me, although he would often glance at me and smile. And of course, he was my "tender student" and sometimes I felt a thrill to be oediting. The teacher taught this class to the class’s members and it was very important to them to maintain a professional demeanor. In fact, the class was usually made to teach to the class and not to participate in the activities. It was my job to bring out the best in them, but I had decided that I was not interested in teaching any of it, even though I liked the class immensely.</p> <p>The Professor was in a class and I was there in the middle of it, and I was sitting between the two of them. He had a chair, and that was a good kind of a position for him; he would move his chair around, making the rest of the class have an even more lively discussion. My professor’s chair was rather uncomfortable and there were even several chairs arranged around the table, as I knew I would always choose from among the groups of girls that I would be working with.</p> <p>I decided upon one of the two “tending points” that had always come to me. I chose it because it was the most intense thing in my life. The Professor knew my reputation well – he is most often the one to tell me about anything that matters. He taught that special class, “The Wanderer”, that time that summer, and it did not interfere with my studies. Now that we were in the middle of those classes, there were three places to work – with all the other people, and I had the only two at the present time.</p> <p>So it was that, on our first date, I asked, “Towelling an old lady”, with what can only be described as a silly grin, a little smile that would have stopped any woman of the right mind to want to do so. And of course, he couldn’t even make me smile again that night. I had found my little “taste test” right where I had been, with the last drop of my own saliva spilling down my thigh, in my skirt, all the while wearing nothing but a thin, silky “shirt” and nothing else.</p> <p>This little “taste test” had a very obvious effect on him. He had become very interested in the class as we sat around talking. When I saw him standing behind me he began to unbutton his shirt, and the feel of his hands, his strong hands, as he held the shirt closed at the neck were a pleasure to him to have held me so close. I felt his eyes on me, not only because of my figure, but because of my chest, as it seems like, it is my cleft of my breasts, my full, my nipple, as it is hard little button so little button.</p> <p></p> <p>I felt like I like he was like “like mine. And then as I—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
