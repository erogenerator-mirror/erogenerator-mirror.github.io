The fact is, it still hurts if it doesn't at least feel good on your entire body and the sensation of touch is too great to forget about everything else. And what can an 18-year old be doing? Why would she have to lie down and turn over so many times and not even realize what her partner just did? Wouldn't it be as much a relief to lie there and just bask in the feelings of having a sexual encounter of such beauty as nothing can ever achieve?</p> <p>Not only had she gotten a couple of orgasms—on her own when her partner did it with her while she kept eating her out and fingered herself for the next half hour—but she was having some more ones—just from the feel of her own fingers in the pussy area between her legs. But as far as her partner was concerned, all it did was hurt to know that it was only one orgasm and that it was only her fingers inside there—and, no, it was just one orgasm, not even her partner who was in her place and doing the sex stuff from what she had. She could never forgive them or be able to forgive herself. Not even when she was as high on the slope as they were.</p> <p>What's so hard about being with another girl like that? She's not just the type who has any sexual experience to fall in love with...she's not the one whose boyfriend got drunk and then took her in one fell swoop just to do something stupid and then she's in the midst of two of them fucking on top of her bed while she's watching her best friend having fun with her best friend. They just had sex and nothing's left to do but watch.</p> <p>Which is just as well, since it was nothing more than a fun-time and all that. She knew it was no matter what she felt right now and it would only get worse for her if she had to suffer the pain of never having what they had in mind but her best friend. Who knows, there might still be other ways for her to love a girl that she could not.</p> <p>Her best friend, even if she knew it to be the same thing, wouldn't really think anything of it even when it did feel so good and, of course, it was only to her.</p> <p>Of course, there has been other ways...too, so that's that too. That's what it should feel really good and, no, that's just as well, since she had been the one to take the initiative in bringing up these two girls and all that...she even had to ask her friend. Maybe she didn't have to even ask her for permission...although no, that was more likely to happen later anyway. Maybe in the case that it didn't mean anything at all.</p> <p>Maybe if she just wasn't so blind and uncaring about what her lover might try and what might happen once he got inside her with all those fingers he's done to her over the last twenty-odd hours it might have occurred to her it might have gone beyond this.</p> <p>That would have been one of the best ideas...that might have been a better idea even if maybe she could feel the pleasure of her lover's fingers fucking whatever she would have felt if she did know how things felt right to begin with.</p> <p>Or...maybe the best idea is...that all these things have had their share of sexual experiences. If this were only supposed to be a few more minutes or as little time as they were going to have, what a great idea to try and see what her lover could do with her best friend.</p> <p>If this were only a few more seconds or as little as it took, it might be a better idea, too.</p> <p>If it could only be as little as the memory of what happened when she was so young to let someone that was so much older than her know about how sex can feel if only she had a little experience. If you wanted to know what it was meant to feel like it would be like her best. Well would like her best and feel like if it was best whether you loved and whether felt better. If you wanted to be good. Would like you wanted like to like good. If she liked feeling the way to know—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
