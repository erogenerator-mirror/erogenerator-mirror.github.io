Along the leafy road which skirted a narrow, tortuous stream in central Louisiana, rumbled</strong> the waves of the summer that swept from the eastern shore. There was a great oak on one of the sides. Below the trellis was a long, flat, circular, rectangular, flat rock.</p> <p>There could be no other more beautiful thing to be on the Earth.</p> <p>On the bank of this river, below the tall, flat rocks in the middle of a lake, we came up on a plateau called the Perch. It is a small creek and is fed by a low stream and a huge, gee-jumbo. It is only a hundred yards deep, so neither of us ever ventured to the Perch.</p> <p>After our short walk down the bank, we stood quietly staring out across the lake. As we stared out, our eyes began to glisten, glancing at the rocks beneath. For a fraction of a second, we were lost in a vision of pure beauty. But at the same time, we were gazing at the perfect landscape of the lake as the waters began to gush out. And I could feel my cock begin to get hard in my pants.</p> <p>For a few minutes, I thought I saw the bottom of a glacier. It was a short time later when I caught sight of a tall, wide, dark lake. Up above was a single stone cliff with a wide flat ledge below. Down below, there were several small stone bays of rocks in a wide, flat circular pool. In the middle of the pool, stood a small waterfall that appeared to flow steadily towards the center.</p> <p>A big, old, wooden table was sitting on one of the rocks. On top of the table, on its front, stood a small stone box and in the centre, a large glass jar. On top of the box, on top of the jar, stood the four clear, white caps, one each side.</p> <p>On the top were a large, heavy wooden framed picture frame. There were three pictures - one picture, of me, as I stood on the table, with my erection bulging in my pants, the other, of this guy standing on the stone ledge, clearly and proudly showing himself to me; the left, the first picture, was of him holding me from behind while his thumb worked its magic on my right pecker.</p> <p>I didn't know quite how to feel. As I looked at these pictures, I knew there was something of a taboo aspect to this. And yet, after we had taken a few pictures together in a very innocent fashion, things seemed very different. After I had been very good and good at sucking a cock, and before I had been good and good, it was really rather exciting when I was in control.</p> <p>But now, as my cock throbbed in front of me, for I couldn't even begin to describe how hard it was, I was about to experience something that I never thought was possible.</p> <p>It was a beautiful summer sunset.</p> <p>I wondered at the strange, magical, yet erotic, excitement that I felt at being so very close to watching a nude beauty as she stood naked, holding a man's cock in her right hand. I knew what I was going to do. There was no holding back now. I could feel my heart beating like a drum as I knelt down on the bank and kissed the warm, moist lips of my gorgeous, little, innocent, little, innocent, innocent, innocent girl.</p> <p>It wasn't so much the kiss that I was about to take as the kiss between the beautiful girl in the pictures but more like a full, extended, passionate encounter between two lovers.</p> <p>Now, it really was so much more than anything I'd ever imagined. The experience that I was about to experience, it was so much more.</p> <p>I knelt down in an embrace of soft, silky naked, naked, naked woman and leaned my head into kiss her lips and on top of her tits. And when our kiss broke and I looked up at her from her chest, she smiled back. And as I looked at where my hand had been, my hands found their way to where my lips were.</p> <p>The kiss with her was still the first of many for many nights, many years, and many years to come. But this first kiss, just like it could never be the last, was now the most passionate and tender of every kiss in this world.</p> <p>The passion, the intimacy, the loving, the care, the love, the passion and the joy of being with another real woman, for who knows, maybe it was only natural for the people around us to make love, as we are making love, to each other others at that was natural.</p> <p></p> <p>not natural natural. not natural</p> <p>natural.</p> <p>natural</p> <p></p> <p>natural Natural Natural natural Natural Naturalâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
