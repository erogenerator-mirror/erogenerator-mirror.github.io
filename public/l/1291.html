The Rendezvous</h4><p><strong>The first words that Albert uttered to his friend, on the following morning, contained a request that Franz would accompany him on a visit to the count; true, the young</strong> man was an enthusiastic supporter of the count's program for the count's children. Franz made the request, but never once questioned why he could not do so on the first day.</p> <p>*</p> <p>"And you say I can do things better with my hands than I can do doing things better," Albert remarked one of Franz's favourite stories of the count. After reading Franz's book of stories, he was so pleased that he found his friend's words and expression very appealing, his heart filling with emotion.</p> <p>"Oh Franz," Franz said and took hold of Albert's hands in theirs, smiling at the expression.</p> <p>"Oh, I think your hands are just right," Franz said as he kissed his hand and gave it a gentle squeeze. "It's because your palms aren't so perfect."</p> <p>"Yes, there've been some very great men and women, in England," Franz said. "And there'd been a time when they had all been so busy that they were happy to just walk away and leave us alone."</p> <p>"If only you knew all those years and how often I thought of you and wished it would never end," Franz said. They kissed and Albert felt his hand move so carefully, so easily, so delicately towards his friend's crotch.</p> <p>"It's just something I've been waiting for forever ... and right here," Franz said and slid his hand under the hem of Erich's T-shirt, as he leaned back and exposed the young man's pale, tanned torso. He slid his fingers lightly over his lower abdomen, tickling Albert's soft skin with his fingertips.</p> <p>"You're beautiful," Franz murmured as he leaned forward and began to kiss the young man's neck, his lips making their way to Albert's ear lobe. "Your skin is so smooth," he said as he gently nibbled along the ear-lobe. "You're so warm and soft," he said in a voice that hinted of his passion. Erich leaned back and gazed at the young man's body, his head tipped back as he enjoyed Franz's slow, sensual touch. He reached over and slowly undid the button on Franz's jeans, pulling them down his legs, letting the black lace pants slide along the carpet down to his feet. Franz continued to gently tease Albert, his soft fingertips sliding over his cock and moving upwards to caress the young man's balls.</p> <p>"No, you shouldn't ..." Erich began to argue but before he had a chance to talk, Franz pulled his face backwards and opened his lips to kiss him, kissing him hard but so delicately that it felt as though one would need a soft tongue to guide their lips apart and to open up to the probing of the strong, sensual lips. "I think I should just go upstairs and enjoy myself, just for tonight," Franz said as they broke the kiss and stepped back.</p> <p>"Oh, Erich," Franz said as Franz reached out for him, taking the young man's hand and leading him into a side door. The two of them walked down the narrow corridor and into Franz's bedroom, Erich following close behind. "Oh my," Franz said as he looked at the room that belonged to his friends, his eyes looking up at the large bed and the large, white cover.</p> <p>"So ... what do we do now?" Erich asked as he watched Erich go over to the bed. Franz walked over to Erich and stood behind him, putting one hand around the young man's waist and one on the small of Erich's back, his fingers caressing the young man's skin lightly. Erich's head was leaning back on Franz's shoulder, enjoying the young man's sensual touch while he ran his fingers softly through his hair.</p> <p>"Well," was all Erich could utter with his mouth full as Franz slid his hand down Erich's stomach and ran his fingertips over his cock, sliding a finger under Erich's boxers towards Erich's ass. Erich's cock was completely erect, straining to be freed and Albert moved around behind him, his hand moving over Erich's buttocks and pushing up until Erich felt the rough fingertips grip onto the cheeks of his ass. Franz moved his hand until the tip of him, with only the head, had emerged from Erich's ass crack before pushing him back onto the bed. Erich watched as Franz knelt on the edge of the bed and parted his legs, pulling him towards him, his own cock standing erect.</p> <p>Erich let Franz's cock slip out of him, watching as the head disappeared up Erich's smooth skin, Erich's hands on Franz's shoulders, Erich's chest. Franz reached out and ran his strong hands all over Erich's hard, excited as Franz's his body. He let the older man's hands slip round Erich's body and explore, caress the body, as he felt Franz's hands andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
