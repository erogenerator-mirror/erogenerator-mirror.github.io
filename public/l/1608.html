So, as the three had sex, it was the first night of Emma's first real fuck.</p> <p>After the first fuck, they had made love several times in three different positions, each being both the most enjoyable. So, with Mr. Black's encouragement, Emma took up a position with him, and his attention continued to a place of sexual excellence not often shared by his class. Emma never considered herself in the business of having sex with a class full of male students for their own private pleasure—not when it was to take a place in Emma's life—but, since they never had a time when they could take a chance on her, Emma would find her way to the Professor of Conduct if only by being there, which she was, and with him.</p> <p>Emma's first fuck with the man was never at the event that the young man, whom she was meeting at the end of one of the lectures, and whom she would subsequently see again, and who at that point would, for a time, be as a sexual creature, as some might be thought, the course of her life. Indeed, for as she had that first year of her new-found sexual relationship with her former Professor and her now-friend and partner and teacher, it was always as sexless as anything Emma knew. It was always a case that Emma knew, and she could never forget, the man that she fucked in the middle of her lecture.</p> <p>For Emma, sex was not something she thought was in any way a means of improving her social standing at university. She knew as well as it did that, although she had no sexual experience at university, her sexual education was very good—like her academic record in French. Even at home in the school, she liked her husband. For Emma—and the student bodies for Emma as well—it was just sex. Emma knew as well as she knew it that sex was her own way of making herself happy, and she could do that wherever she wanted. Indeed, when it came to the pleasure she derived from it, sometimes she enjoyed having a lover that would never forget it, and so could she.</p> <p>That first summer of Emma's new-found sexual relationship with a Professor Black, the one she was meeting at the end of the course, was the beginning of the long time Emma was to be a virgin. For Emma herself it was also the end of the course, but there was no hurry, Emma was determined. But, for a year, Emma had been doing sex.</p> <p>For Emma, Emma had to accept. Or be forced. It would have hurt her. But of course, being that she had started the course that year as a student, it would have to be. But Emma had already been fucked. And she had been made love to. That was the main reason Emma was seeking to graduate—to be a teacher. And this year of her life would also have to be the beginning of something.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>On the morning of June 28th, after Mr. Knightley had left for University, Emma was waiting outside her apartment for a taxi, and after he had dropped her off at her place she had gone to her apartment to change her clothes. She had gone all the way to the university and got a decent taxi, but she had also done something else. As soon as she started the long drive to Mr. Knightley's apartment to collect her belongings, Emma had gone to her apartment to change her knickers. She put them on: she was going to be naked.</p> <p>But not all the way. Some, perhaps not all the way, Emma did everything she could imagine of a boy taking a girl to bed and forcing her to a kind of sexual encounter on him. She did it on occasion, but even then, she tried very hard to keep her sexual life with her husband secret and private. Even if she had done at least one bit of public humiliation, she had not done all of them. It was always just "cheating" and "feeling like doing it for the boys." Not that she would ever feel guilty about doing it—but just because the boys knew about it.</p> <p>Now Emma had gone to an uni and had been expelled. So, she had gone to a local college and gone to a male dormitory, at which she had been forced to be in the presence of a male student at the time. Of course, although there was nothing wrong with it, it was very un-Christian and very much an excuse to humiliate herself—and the boys of this university for that matter. But not so easily as to make the boy at such university think that she was a slut for being the way she was. Emma. And that would not be quite what she; a normal a slut for a slut as Emma was a slut. It would be like this. But not just as the way men. Emma would be—and be—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
