The firing from the gun was about to begin again. Against that grape-shot, they could not hold out a quarter of an hour longer.</strong></p> <p>The soldiers had formed an inner circle and they knew they were close.</p> <p>The gun fire began and the men took off again and again, moving closer to the fire.</p> <p>One soldier was behind the first and he pulled out his handgun.</p> <p>The men came charging into the darkness.</p> <p>One soldier pointed that empty chamber at the soldiers and fired.</p> <p>Then a third and the soldier followed.</p> <p>Then they fell back, unconscious.</p> <p>The soldiers were exhausted but they were not dead. They were alive but still fully clothed.</p> <p>The gun fell towards the man lying sprawled in the middle of a bed. On top of that, two men lay on top of him. The man's head was pushed into the neck of his enemy.</p> <p>The soldier was on top, pushing down into the soldier.</p> <p>Another soldier lay on top of the first, their sweaty bodies entwined.</p> <p>One soldier stood up, a look upon his face. That look told him that there was no going back.</p> <p>He looked away and his eyes glowed.</p> <p>When their eyes met, his features turned a strange shade of green.</p> <p>The soldier began to laugh.</p> <p>Their lips met.</p> <p>The kiss burned it's way through the soldier.</p> <p>Their tongues snaked out and played against each other.</p> <p>The soldier's arms encircled the other man.</p> <p>The kiss continued.</p> <p>The soldier's left hand went between the other man's legs.</p> <p>It wasn't hard to figure out why they had taken off their shoes. Maybe because they weren't wearing any socks.</p> <p>Or maybe both men were.</p> <p>Maybe both soldiers were.</p> <p>The soldier pulled the man's hand downward.</p> <p>It moved over the inside curve of his leg. His fingers found something. They were cool and smooth. They ran over his crotch and started to stroke it.</p> <p>The soldier pushed his dick into the other man's trousers.</p> <p>As they rubbed against each other, the soldier's finger slid under his underwear and touched his ass hole.</p> <p>The man didn't resist.</p> <p>He didn't move.</p> <p>The soldier removed the soldier's trousers and underwear as well.</p> <p>He then moved to his belt buckle and unfastened it.</p> <p>The soldier's cock started to harden again.</p> <p>The soldier's cock was already hard.</p> <p>It was only the soldier's fingers that made the cock rise to attention.</p> <p>The soldier's eyes stayed locked on the soldier's.</p> <p>The soldier's eyes burned brighter, as his head shot back, a look upon his face.</p> <p>His hips pushed forward and he fucked the man's hand.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, fuck, fuck me!"</p> <p>"Oh, your fingers feel good, soldier!"</p> <p>"Yeah, we're all hot for you! Fuck this feels good!"</p> <p>"What about you?"</p> <p>"I want that, soldier. I want your big fucking cock in me!"</p> <p>The soldier reached forward and took the Colonel by his shirt.</p> <p>He pulled the man's shirt over his head and then tossed it over the Colonel's back.</p> <p>The soldier's hands slid over the Colonel's chest, rubbing the hard nipples that were poking against his shirt.</p> <p>Without being told, the soldier pulled down his pants and underwear.</p> <p>The soldier kneeled between the young man's legs and, without a word, his cock sprang out to attention.</p> <p>The soldier had already lubed his cock and was about to put it inside the soldier's ass.</p> <p>"That's it, soldier, open wide and get it in."</p> <p>The soldier pulled back on the man's hips and pushed forward.</p> <p>"Oh, my!"</p> <p>"Yay! Now, soldier! Fuck, fuck, that's big! Go faster!"</p> <p>"You want me to fuck your ass, soldier."</p> <p>The soldier pushed into the warm flesh of the soldier's ass.</p> <p>The soldier was moaning and groaning as the soldier's cock slid into him.</p> <p>It got harder and harder.</p> <p>With each thrust, the soldier was going deeper into the soldier's ass.</p> <p>After a minute or so, the soldier pulled back out of the soldier's ass and was a good thing.</p> <p>it had to be. with the soldier, but it was. a good thing to do of them both, that was it seemed to be , even. and to be—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
