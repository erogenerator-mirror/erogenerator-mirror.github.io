G. Wells </h3><h4>THE EVE OF THE WAR.</h4><p><strong>No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man’s and yet as</strong> wise as can see, we lived this time around, yet, it is all about how a woman and a man can look down Their society while being sexually dominated. In the first and last centuries, many people had found out their woman had discovered the benefits of Marriage. With such men’s minds on the field of sexual slavery, our government believed that its views were that of the First World. Yet, in those twentieth-century Age when a woman could be tied down, to be used as a device by a man or a woman. Only after learning who she was and what her body looked like, did it just seem possible that she could get married without any hassle.</p> <p>"No man will ever fuck a wife; he will have to love her," President Kennedy told the President. "No man will ever marry a woman without a wedding band. If a woman had a husband, she might be as beautiful in bed, as beautiful in her naked body as in her unfettered body and she may even have such a beautiful face that men would drool over."</p> <p>While President Kennedy was not in the President’s league of men, she knew very well what men wanted and were willing to take advantage of a woman’s body or an opportunity to do so. In the time it would take her to find and marry the man her husband wanted to marry, she had to go on her own to find men like every other man he ever met. He wanted a man who could be a man and would love and be loyal. If she found these men who would love and be loyal by marrying her, she wasn’t going to let him marry her. What a woman would do; where was the only way? Besides, it wasn’t her. She wasn’t an independent woman, she didn’t go by her own name, she wasn’t married to this man and didn’t have a husband. She was only a man and not a woman. Only if her husband knew what he wanted and was willing to marry her, wouldn’t he marry her.</p> <p>Instead of being a man and marrying the man she wanted, she married the man who was her husband. With all her other manly characteristics available in a man, especially a sex-crazed male, it didn’t take her long to realize what she sought in a man.</p> <p>“It’s because I’m the most beautiful woman in the world. There’s nothing wrong with an older man being a man too. With him being so handsome, too handsome, too gorgeous, he needs more than just his good looks and good looks,” she answered herself at her own admission. “Even though I'm not a man for him, I’m a woman who just wants to please him. Not just want to please him, but also for me to please him and give him pleasure and love and sex to satisfy both of us. I do love him. That’s enough said for the past thousand years when the beauty of the human body began to die and we were just happy to be on a good enough list, but now, it’s all about having sex. Sex is for the woman, not the man. We must be sexually compatible,” she said as she reached for her breast again. She wasn’t done talking yet.</p> <p>When she was done talking and her breasts were exposed to the sun, she felt so proud of her sexy body and wanted to give him more attention,” she said. “With my body so sexy and my breasts so full when I wear this skimpy costume, and my nipples poking out at you while I’m talking, I’d love to give you even sexier looks. Now, would you really like to fuck me, a man-whore?”</p> <p>Although she had no intention of marrying a man with a big penis, the thought of marrying a man with a big penis excited her further. While he was already a man, there was something of a catch here. She was only a man and only a man, not even a married woman. Moreover, she didn’t want to risk breaking the rules that should be put in place with such a man.</p> <p>“I think I could do with sex,” she told him before she did something she was sure he would find sexually stimulating. “Now that I know that I’m not a woman and an old enough to be an old enough, maybe, I’m not a man. If only a man, or woman’n’s too old to take care for you.’n’ like to take care for me take me.’s no. Take me. In’ me. Take me for me as you me with love me with love me. Take me—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
