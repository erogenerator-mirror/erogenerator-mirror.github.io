English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter LXIII. Talk with the Kings.</h4><p><strong>On his way Zarathustra meets two more higher men of his time; two kings cross his path. They are above the average modern type; for their instincts tell them what</strong> he means to them. They are above and beyond that they are their king. And for their sake, he will not be alone.</p> <p>All of his brothers are there, they will be there for him. And he will be there for them in this most amazing, romantic, sacred, human bonding. For he will be there now, in their presence. For he will experience a lot, for he will make his best choice one day. For they are here. They will be waiting for him.</p> <p>The first couple of words she heard to him were those two lovebirds; they will be happy in this moment. He will be happy in this life. For she was thinking to herself, she was right. He had decided that tonight wasn't going to make any difference in human life, that he would have sex and be happy. That would be a sign of his manhood; he would be happy to have sex in his very own bed right now.</p> <p>The two lovers began to kiss, as they kissed each other on the mouth. They stopped and kissed their way down to his manhood. He felt as if he was being watched, as she was moving over the first inch of his shaft. In the midst of this foreplay, she had taken him in a very intimate way, taking the first half of him in her hot, wet mouth. The lovers were now a naked body writhing in passionate passion while kissing and caressing as if they'd never kiss or touch before.</p> <p>Zarathustra's first reaction to their intimacy was to run away. As he watched his cock being engulfed by this sexy woman, he couldn't help but wonder how he would describe the feeling she was giving to him. He was imagining it coming to him in the most intimate way possible, and here in front of him in the middle of his bed, it's true, it's real, right there, his naked cock being engulfed by this woman's incredible, hot, sexy mouth. He began his own passionate kiss with this beautiful woman's lips, as he moved his hands behind her, touching her breasts through the thin material. As her fingers began to undress him, and he began to undress himself, she slowly shed her panties, which had been laid out on the bed, just inches away from the lovers. He didn't know that she was wearing a thong but he found out with just one finger that she was shaved completely bare.</p> <p>Zarathustra's pussy, as he had known it to be for many minutes, is still dripping as he removed his shirt. He was still feeling the sexual charge he received because even though only this first evening had changed him, his sex was still a good, hot, wet place. She lay him down on his back and she began to kiss, lick and suck his cock, all around it. She was licking him at the base of his shaft, while she gently and carefully, slowly lowered her head to his pubescent cock, taking most of him into her mouth, feeling the throbbing hardness of him. She sucked his cock hard, and slowly moving her mouth up to the head of his cock. She stopped momentarily to lick him from his balls to the tip of his cock. All the time she was sucking him, and she was moving her head and her mouth up and down on his manhood. Her eyes were shut, her movements were jerky in rhythm with the movements of her mouth. She continued licking and sucking the head of his cock to the base, then continued up on his balls. She licked his balls, then, gently, licked back down to his cock. She was licking him down and back up, around his crown, then, slowly, she took him again into her mouth and sucked him hard, going up and down quickly, her tongue moving over him, feeling the fullness of him. He began to moan and groan. She sensed that he was reaching the precipice of sexual explosion. She sensed how close to orgasm he was, so close. She took him again into her mouth and began to move her tongue against him, moving it up and down the head, feeling his hardness against her tongue and rubbing against it, then, she felt his body tighten and his cock begin to pulsate. It was a sign of his climax. It was a sign of the beginning of his sexual bliss. It was a sign of a huge, powerful climax. She had been with many men, had loved him so. But this moment... this first time... this was a sign of the beginning of the end, the beginning of what life for them might be.</p> <p>He lay there, his body, of its body, of its person... of its mind... and all three times, his sexual parts... his love.</p> <p>*End<|>Zarathanth <|th<|<|ath<<|> <> <>*|> <>â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
