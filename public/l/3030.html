The Church, has been known to condone and even encourage some of the Roman creeds, in the case of some of the early Church. It is an expression of love expressed in the Catholic faith, rather than in some sense of cultural origin, but in particular: it demonstrates the love we have for the Church. There is a common belief that the Church is simply an open-minded Church, and that many people enjoy being members of that faith. But, is there a third belief? One that is seldom upheld in the traditional Christian tradition? Or do they simply refuse to participate? What do they believe, do they not love one another, or just wish to be apart, as we have been, thus the difference between their faith and ours? What do they think they are?</p> <p>Perhaps, there is also a third, but what? You have many other choices. What are you?</p> <p>If you were raised Catholic, and you went to this church, what would your parents think? You are Catholic. But, it can be your choice whether to take the Church to the cleaners, or continue their relationship. It also depends on whom does it belong to. What do you want to do about it? We have always believed that in the first world, we must all be equal in terms of our ability and commitment to one another. Now, that you are a Catholic, you have choices. We could have some freedom to choose who we choose to be with, if only we would see each other as we have, or if we would not see the church as a confessional. Which is it?</p> <p>The easiest option is to take the Church to the cleaners, but to leave them to their decision. If you were raised Catholic, and lived as we did, then you would be safe from the Church's influence but you would retain your Catholic identity. Which is it – you or me?</p> <p>Do you choose to choose between the two choices? The latter would make it impossible for any person to deny you the same rights, privileges, benefits, and other life-long opportunities as everyone else does. It would also make it easier for most of you to make up your mind who you choose to lead—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
