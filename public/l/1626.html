It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, which she walked about the lawn the next morning to</strong> enjoy. Then she took off her suit, took off all her clothing, put it aside, and crawled naked into bed and fell asleep. But that is another story.</p> <p>Sue was a very attractive girl of 18, with a tight, shapely body. She had long black wavy hair that flowed to the middle of her back. It was very curly and she would sometimes leave it hanging out just a little. She was 5'6" with dark brownish-brown eyes, smallish breasts, narrow waist, a very nice ass, and she did not have small waist. She was, however, very sexy, and in that moment she had the most remarkable, desirable man she had ever experienced.</p> <p>Their relationship had started out as a silly, childish game. However, on her eighteenth birthday, in the midst of some silly game-play, they both discovered that they could make the other happy. They would begin making out, and the fun, the romance would start. They always were on one of the many nights they would stay up late partying, fucking, and finally getting it on. For her birthday, neither girl seemed to care that they had left their clothes lying around for a while, their bodies squirming together, and they wanted to feel that same excitement again.</p> <p>And so it began.</p> <p>They loved it; they just loved to be with each other, to be involved in each other. They always got to know each other enough well so that when they were alone while fucking it would be just a matter of time, and they had their fun and they would do whatever they wanted with each other. They had always felt that their first fuck was just a chance to really spice up their relationship, and it gave them something new to try.</p> <p>So the night started innocently enough: they had decided that they would get into it together and start to make out. The time was right now, and even if they didn't realize how the night was going to end, it was still perfect for playing to each other.</p> <p>They both stood up from their beds immediately. It was time to make another good first impression for both of them. They kissed one another, and as they kissed they reached down to squeeze each other's asses. They began exploring one another's bodies with their hands. They both moaned as they felt the warmth of the other's body. They explored one another and were both moaning audibly. Their hands went all over one another's bodies touching, probing, exploring. They both moaned into each other's mouth with pleasure and satisfaction.</p> <p>When they finally stopped kissing, both hands went up the others body searching for their body parts, and found their pussy. Their kissing stopped when their lips met, and their fingers went back through the other's body to make themselves cum. Then they went on searching in each others' pussies for their boyfriends' cocks. It was now a very hot night.</p> <p>It was time for them to make up their mind, their first real night of true, passionate sex. Neither person knew how to say it properly. "Fuck me, make me cum," both said at the same time.</p> <p>They both knew what they had to do. They both took each others' hand, got on their knees, and placed their mouths near their crotch. Their tongues were soon dancing around one another's mouth, and both girls' tongues soon met. Their mouths were now pressed hard against one another's. Their tongues were in each other's mouth; their cocks were in the other's pussy. Their boyfriends' had suddenly become very hard. They rubbed their cocks together. They rubbed one another's tongues together, their mouths getting tighter. Their cocks were rubbing all of each others' hands: their hands were rubbing their cocks together, their cocks were rubbing their cocks together. Both girls were moaning, and neither girl was breathing.</p> <p>Then, with a great passion, both girls pushed their heads together and kissed hard and long. Then they opened their mouths and their tongues were in each other's mouth. They made out with each other, and made out with one another. Then both women made out with each other and the other gave pleasure with their mouths. They were just kissing, enjoying the moment, and it was so erotic that, both women were sweating. They could feel the heat of their bodies on one another as they kissed, their cocks pressed hard against one another. Both ladies were in heaven; their hands on one another's bodies, their tongues inching closer and closer to one another. Both guys were now close to ejaculating, as they kissed passionately, but neither guy could wait anymore.</p> <p>Finally, it was time to decide who got to make the next step the best first move. But first move. The final, the ball.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The main one</p> <p>The</p> <p></p> <p>The winner the :â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
