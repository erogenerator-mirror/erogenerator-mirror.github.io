It was the longest day on Earth, but not yet the biggest, the most exciting of all. And neither were too hung over to finish it.</p> <p>"That felt so good."</p> <p>"Yeah, I think we're going to do that again soon." He whispered between licks, and his hands gripped her naked hips firmly, and pulled her in tight as he felt her breasts push against his furry chest. She squealed with delighted pleasure as he kissed the tops of her breasts lovingly, enjoying their smooth firmness and the goose-flesh under his touch. He let his hands continue squeezing and groping her, while he kissed the tips of her nipples as they hardened. She moaned seductively all the time, her eyes gleaming like gold, while he sucked and kissed her breasts eagerly. Then he licked and sucked her breasts, making her shiver all over as he did it and it turned her on so.</p> <p>"Fuck, you're sexy." She breathed in his ear as she licked his earlobe. "I have definitely never had someone do anything like that for me before."</p> <p>"Then do me..." He whispered into her ear before lowering his mouth to her neck and sucking it as his hands went to her ass, kneading and squeezing it. "Take off my shirt... I've been a good boy." He growled like an animal and got his shirt off. It was a long long wait and it took a lot of work, but eventually she had it off. She turned onto all fours on the bed, and he knelt behind her, licking, kissing and sucking her ass. It tasted so good and tasted so nice too. She moaned as his tongue trailed up past her buttocks to her pussy, tasting her, making her squirm and pant. It was a sweet, musky and creamy taste that made all of his senses reel and her body shake with delight. "Oh, yeah, lick my ass!" She breathed. "You haven't licked any ass you've ever licked... ever."</p> <p>He licked her asshole, causing her to gasp and squirm, then went back to lick and taste her pussy. She moaned in delight as he made her cum, making her squirt all over his face. "Oh, yeeeaaaaa... Oh!" She squealed as he licked all around her pussy and ass, making her juices glisten against every touch. All the while, he ran his fingers up and down and over the soft, pink fleshy lips, making them shine for him as he worked to make her so incredibly wet for him.</p> <p>"I have another thing for you." He whispered to her. "Now lay on your back. I want to enjoy you."</p> <p>She didn't really feel like lying down, and felt a bit frustrated when he positioned himself for the first time since she had turned over. He ran his hand up her side and across her breasts, kissing them, then squeezing them and pulling them.</p> <p>"Mmm... You don't know what to do with those."</p> <p>He looked down at her. He had a naughty, little grin on his face. He took a finger and brushed his index finger across her nipples. They were rock hard, like little gumdrops, but they weren't as big as his ex-girlfriend's. But they were definitely very responsive and he liked it.</p> <p>"Why don't you lay on your back?" He smiled.</p> <p>"I think I'll lay on my back."</p> <p>"No way. Take off your clothes, then lay on your back."</p> <p>She did as he said, and felt a chill through her belly all the way down to the tips of her toes. She wasn't shy, and she loved it when he pulled her on her side to kneel between her legs, spreading, and sucking her pussy for him. It was such a pleasurable feeling to watch him do it, so much better than she wanted to do. His head was between her legs but he still had his head against her pussy, which made her pussy lips swell up around his nose and made her clit stand up so much firmer, and stick up like a little balls. This was her. So he rubbed little little tongue licking her pussy and his finger was licking her clit was sucking her whole, that was so well and she felt. He sucked her pussy felt she couldn'tâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
