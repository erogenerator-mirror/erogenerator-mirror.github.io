Open on the table, beside her</strong>, was a huge dildos, and on the table was a pair of sex toys. Sós body had been turned into an erotic object for Sås fantasy. She had never thought to bring her toys – until her lover had mentioned that she was a porn star.</p> <p>There was no denying the pleasure being displayed by Sós body, especially her dildo dildo, having the pleasure of being used by a man who was no longer Sós lover. And to be able to pretend her own body was being used as the object she had always dreamed and fantasized about for years.</p> <p>Breathe.</p> <p>Her breasts had not been played with, and for the first time she had felt, for the first time, a man or a woman to have a penis, to slide her own lubrication past her own dildo. The pleasure and pleasure the dildo had provided her as a female was not merely a pleasant substitute or a pleasant replacement for her own body. No, it was the real thing, and from time to time someone would have put his penis inside her mouth or inside her vagina or even inside her womb.</p> <p>Yet there was some part of Sós body that she felt a bit strange, and the feeling was not unpleasant. And so it was that in some way it was a turn-on for her to have something in her mouth. There was a certain irony about the whole idea of being able to suck on a sex toy, to play with her own clitoris as she had imagined Sási, to have the pleasure of having her own penis inside her own mouth.</p> <p>As she listened to the sounds behind her curtain Sós body responded to the attention of the dildo, and the sensation of being connected to his woman by this woman. In some ways this was better than a lover could be – not only the pleasure of receiving a real penis inside her body but also of giving to a woman by using her own body - the pleasure of sex.</p> <p>She wondered whether her own body was as good a plaything as she felt, or if perhaps the feeling of being connected to a dildo as a man would be good, having an experience.</p> <p>While Sós thoughts dwelt over her own body and the dildo, in a way this was also the place it was her body that had her body being used. The feeling of being connected with a man by a sex toy or by using a woman was something she could experience, feel – indeed, enjoy having experienced, not just enjoy. She wondered about whether her own body matched its partner's physical form.</p> <p>As she continued listening to the sounds between her curtain Sás body reacted to the sounds of other women, she felt herself becoming aroused. That part of her mind that she had never felt before was being stimulated by something she had never experienced. Was being sexually excited by something she had never fully imagined a woman possibly experiencing would be a source of pleasure?</p> <p>After a moment of silence SÃa stopped listening to the sounds of the curtain and took a deep breath as she realized the time. With a final touch of her hand to the dildo Bina’s body was now completely immersed in a sea of pleasure. Her entire body was alive as she enjoyed the sensations of pleasuring herself, and as Bina began to orgasm she felt something that she had never imagined she had ever feel, or perhaps ever will feel.</p> <p>A penis.</p> <p>Bina’s body jerked and convulsed as if she were experiencing orgasmic pleasure. The penis was thicker than just her imagination, and more importantly more than a penis. It was longer than she’d imagined and thicker than what she had imagined it could be. And it wasn’t just Bina’s body – she also had to admit that she could feel it.</p> <p>Sós body was a different kind of a dildo. It was a woman’s penis as a man – not just another toy inserted into her body but the real thing. It had been a long time since she had felt a real penis inside her body but never did she ever dream of a penis being so much bigger than the cock itself.</p> <p>When Sós body had heard the sounds of her sex toy being caressed by a woman – not just a woman’s penis – however many men had been inside her body, and when she had heard a man’s body being caressed by a woman – the women had seemed to have different and more arousing desires. She liked the feeling of the feeling of being caressed by a woman herself being caressed at the woman. Andrott as caressed by herself and by this woman.</p> <p></p> <p>Sæm woman’s body.</p> <p>m—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
