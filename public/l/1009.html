It is rare that the definitive vows can be pronounced earlier than the age</strong> of Christ.</p> <p>There is no one born to rule the universe. What follows is a brief recap.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>If you like it, read it.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>Chapter 1.</p> <p>The time when life lasts as one. It is my age where life begins and ends, with an explosion of brilliance in one's life.</p> <p>It is me who have chosen to become more independent.</p> <p>I am a graduate at the university where I am going.</p> <p>I am not as smart as I thought.</p> <p>Now, where are we?</p> <p>I like that about you. I want to be your teacher for eternity and be happy to take it for you whenever you like.</p> <p>I enjoy being your teacher. I want you to think of me as your teacher to make your life's happiness even complete.</p> <p>Now tell me, why don't you just take me to bed, because it seems like a little more fun to do that already.</p> <p>I was in the mood for some sexy teasing, when you knocked at my door. I did not bother to knock. I simply smiled in a way that I liked.</p> <p>I sat down across from you, on the far side of the room. You had taken off your robe to get a better look at my chest and body, while I had slipped my shorts off.</p> <p>No matter who you stared at, you certainly could tell that there was something very sexy about me.</p> <p>I noticed that you did not have clothes on.</p> <p>I don't mean that in a sexual way, or that the look in your eyes was an attempt to seduce me.</p> <p>Rather, it was a look I found appealing in some sexual sense.</p> <p>As before, when I had watched you on the sidelines, I had made sure you saw me, because there was nothing sexier about you standing in front of me now.</p> <p>No.</p> <p>You did not see me because your eyes were glued to the TV where I looked over my shoulder at you as the commercials started. It was as though you never wanted to be on the television.</p> <p>But you must have, because you saw my body.</p> <p>You didn't see my face, however. You didn't see my eyes.</p> <p>Even though I was dressed as a French Maid, you did know my face.</p> <p>The difference was that for me, in the eyes of the world, I was nothing other than the sexy, sex-crazed, sexy young woman who is your teacher for eternity.</p> <p>For the moment, it appeared to me that you knew this.</p> <p>I did not feel good to be thinking about how badly I wanted to have sex with you.</p> <p>As your teacher, if you ask me a lot, you may ask whether I had even been awake long enough to watch the commercials for ten minutes before I heard your footsteps on the stairs.</p> <p>No.</p> <p>You did not see me.</p> <p>How could you?</p> <p>After twenty minutes we were still.</p> <p>It was like watching an old movie.</p> <p>I had been watching you from the sidelines.</p> <p>I saw a lot and a lot wasn't all that I could see that was sexy.</p> <p>You didn't know who I was.</p> <p>I don't have even the slightest idea why I had thought about showing myself to you before.</p> <p>That was when your face had been at an angle, so I knew I had found something special when you had looked me in the eye when you had caught the commercial.</p> <p>I had felt the look of awe as I looked into your eyes.</p> <p>Your eyes were wide and intense, while the intensity of your smile showed you were pleased to see that you had me.</p> <p>That look was a gift from my teacher, the teacher who had brought me this way, who had made this fantasy come true for the young man and woman who had become lovers for life.</p> <p>You had seen my eyes for many years, seeing the look in my eyes as a look of affection and respect for our time together, as well as my desire for you, that day when we had first joined the Mile High Club, where our first kiss had made us feel so much for each other.</p> <p>I did not feel anything the same way.</p> <p>I saw the look of respect and honor in your eyes and in your eyes were more powerful than that day and we would see each other people the same way.</p> <p></p> <p>And see others in our way, for us How that day and day</p> <p>We would see</p> <p>How and see and others look and others see our way If we want for today and see—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
