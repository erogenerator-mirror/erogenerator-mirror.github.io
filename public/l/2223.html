I could hear people tumbling up from the cabin and the forecastle, and slipping in an instant outside my barrel,</strong> I was on top of the house again in nothing but my pants, this time with my arms around the back of these young ladies' necks. I could even get a nice long look up their tight skirts before my hands fell into the pockets of their shorts. Their legs were spread, and I leaned down and kissed those thighs. This young ladies' legs spread even wider without me even taking my eyes off them. The wetness between the legs of this young lady was as wet as a pussy. I knew she might not have been wearing any panties, even though I doubted they were even wearing any. The tightness of their skirts meant all of their pussy lips were dripping now. I knew they were both leaking profusely. I looked to the side and noticed that the window was a bit fogged up. They both knew that our little game had just started.</p> <p>I had just managed to get my cock out now and I thought I heard a voice say "Oh fuck me! I'm going to cum!" I got up and quickly got on top of that girl's legs. I had a nice long view on the window, when she put both of her hands behind my neck and pulled me closer.</p> <p>"I know," she said, "My sister's sister is with her boyfriend. They might be back for hours. But I want you. Oh fuck!" I knew she was about to explode as I was about to make her cum a little bit. I just had no idea how or when. I could have just laid there and stroked my cock right there in front of them as they walked by. It would be a nice way to get out of here. I was in heaven.</p> <p>I heard a moan from underneath me, "That's it, let it go," and looked up to see my cockhead getting a few drops of precum on the horizon, and I felt a tight grip on my cockhead in which time had stopped being necessary. The lady behind me held me tight in which I knew she had never felt me cum so far up her pussy in her life. I could hear her and their words as they both screamed out each other, "OH BABY I'M CUMMING! AHHHHH!" she screamed and fell on top of me in what could of left out her orgasm. She held my arms tight as we both came down from our peak, and finally the world stopped being a blur for us to be completely still. After holding each other close, and falling off to the side, we began laughing. This time we had to take our clothes off, just so we could be able to be alone in bed. But we both knew we had to leave very shortly. The ladies went their separate ways for the evening. That took our breath away.</p> <p>A moment later, my parents returned to the cabin. When they saw our bodies, they went into hysterics and the only reason I could think of was I was already getting hard again. We made love and hugged each other again as we walked out. The ladies said goodbye to me one more time, but for the night they never called or returned. I was happyâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
