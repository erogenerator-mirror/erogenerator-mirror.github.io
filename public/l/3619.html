THE NIGHT OF THE TRAGEDY</h4><p><strong>To make this part of my story clear, I append the following plan of the first floor of Styles. The servants’ rooms are reached through the door B. They have</strong> no walls, only ceiling so I can safely fuck. For this chapter, I’m posting this chapter with only a prologue, a lot of the story has just been written, but a little bit has been read. As I said, I write with a keen interest to plot in my stories. That said, some of the characters in the story are in different stages of the recovery process. So for this chapter I’ll tell you what I feel like, but for this chapter a lot of the character is still out of it. Thanks to Kitten, a very understanding friend as well as a very sweet person, she gave me another character to share with as my inspiration is to write what has been written over and over. That she wrote to me was a bonus, she can be very helpful to a writer who doesn’t have her hands full of ideas. Thanks to Tookitillom, a little sister of mine, who taught me some great tricks. So for now, enjoy and remember that the story is not going to become that of a full chapter, so the prologue is probably in there somewhere too.</p> <p>The Author</p> <p>Note:</p> <p>All Characters are eighteen and under 18.</p> <p>Note to readers – There’s a disclaimer to those who don’t know this.</p> <p>To understand this section it would be best to read the first story first.
