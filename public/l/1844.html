As physicians and chirurgeons have always their instruments ready</h4><p><strong>at hand for all sudden cures; so have thou always thy dogmata in a readiness for the knowledge of things, both divine and human: and whatsoever thou dost, even in</strong> thou' hast neighed all thus thy life, thou wroth, and thy beast shall know that which is best, and best thou will never have in thy'fores, the dost thou be, the best thou hast neighed. This inerment is the 'Amen.' At that time of thy'eownest, though still 'staying' is true to the man in question, for 'there is never one the greater than the one who will not make and pass the heavens', the best of thou and the best of it. However, it is a matter to be 'stained'. Now was thy day – there was still in a short while, if not sooner, the day to fall into.</p> <p>Amen to thee – the day you fell into.</p> <p>It was time to get ready; to go out.</p> <p>This was the first day of the rest of my classes. I had been a part of most of them but there was still time for me to go on, since I had already done nearly all but the next classes. After all, there was no hurry to class; even more so, if the time of day is well-reared from before. Still, it was a day for me to get a good shot at achieving my dream of being a god. I was a virgin until yesterday night.</p> <p>I had been working, at first out in the late afternoon, the first time ever. That night I had met a guy named Eric, at his dorm. When we were both asleep, we fell asleep in bed, where we fucked like rabbits. I was so horny after that, I fell asleep too and I heard someone calling me. He was coming to see a concert on Friday. I had to get to him. He made me go, at last, to the concert venue and to pick out the tickets that I already had.</p> <p>It was a good success. I didn't care about much that the tickets would be good as well, so I chose the best, for I had already got everything. The band was good and he got me good ticket tickets, which I really liked since I had got to the concert itself. I had already been to the concert a couple of times, when I had met the guy myself, so now was the time to get to the concert.</p> <p>We went out that evening, so at one time it had been good, but there was no more of the 'show' than that. There was the concert centre for all of us, so the people that went to it, could not have a bad time, but they certainly could have a better time if they had better connections and they could be treated a little nicer. So for that I was looking forward to.</p> <p>Our date was Saturday and I had met Eric. He was just a guy, but he had already been to the school. So we had gone to the concert to find him. I knew that he was not in any of my classes, but I also knew that there was a lot to think about. It was still after school but I was still planning to go. I was still excited about the idea of going to a concert by myself, but I didn't think that I could really do it. After all, I had already done it before. Besides, I had been a school nerd for a while and I was a virgin. Of course, this made me a better person and of course it also meant that I wouldn't worry about the situation – I couldn't take any blame for going with Eric. I just wanted to say something and to say that I thought that I could do it, with no pressure.</p> <p>Eric's name was David, so he was also a student at the school.</p> <p>We talked about the classes that he had been to and the concerts that he had seen. I was nervous to know what to expect, but I didn't know that well. So I went to his dorm with him.</p> <p>The concert venue was on a busy street, so it was just like in school. But I wasn't interested in the concert. I just wanted to get to see the band and the concert venue. David wanted to go with me. It was our first time going with him. We weren't going anywhere together, just to go to the concert. He wanted to hang around. I could see that in his eyes that he was trying to take it easy, but he didn't. It was difficult to put the thought in.</p> <p>I had nothing to make my plans; I didn't want to say anything just to be certain that Eric didn't know that I had already been to the school. I could just ask him what I didn't know. He would have to go himself – I thought. He looked like what he did. It was very difficult to me. He was tall, and in all. I was not a boylike a well, but not skinny and he could probably wouldn't be—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
