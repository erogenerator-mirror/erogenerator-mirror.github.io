But the answer is, of course, the best that could be provided. I would be a man, Socrates, whom you can't do without."</p> <p>When he had said that statement, he had been making a motion to add to the circle. So I got up and knelt. I felt the head of his penis against my anus, which was already starting to respond. When I relaxed, his member slipped into me, which I thought was kind of nice. Once I had it all in, he began thrusting into me. As he thrust in and out, his hands came to rest on my buttocks. My own hands remained on his hips in which I could feel his penis as it pumped in and out of me and his fingers played over my clitoris. The touch of his hands on my skin felt nice, but he didn't go further than that. It seemed like hours ago that we were in the circle, but it wasn't quite that long before the circle itself resumed as if on cue. Before I knew it, I felt it.</p> <p>I felt a warm jet of liquid hitting the wall of my vagina. He had ejaculated in me. I thought that this was a little strange. I've never really liked to be fucked before, other than very often when I masturbate. (My partner in this very moment is a man. He had been there when I got fucked; he got it, though. I got it.) I was surprised that this was such a turn on as in that instant when you could feel that warm fluid that seemed to fill up your belly and run in rivulets through the wall of your pussy. I found my own wetness at first that felt more good. At the same time, however, I found that I was getting wetter all over.</p> <p>After a while, as if I had run through the same thing, his thrusting became less and more controlled. His right hand was on my buttocks, his left hand on my clitoris, and the circle, again, had stopped. My own hands moved to his shoulders, to find his hair, which had fallen past my face. I put my right arm around him, and as he thrust into me, my left arm was at his chest, so that I could rub his nipples. I had not really touched them before, but they seemed to be having the same sort of effect now. The circle started to move, and again I heard the sound of a couple's laughter; they must be fucking. I wondered if they were enjoying it very much.</p> <p>After several minutes, I decided that I hadn't had enough, and that I was ready for more. So I let him pull out of me. As soon as he did, though, though, I felt a burning sensation of emptiness in my vagina. Then, he thrust into me several times and pushed himself against me as he ejaculated into me. It felt fantastic, and it certainly was not something that happens very often in the circle, but that it happened again in that instant was a good sign for me. It did not, however, last long.</p> <p>As soon as he slipped out of me, I got up and we lay back on the blanket. I saw a little smile across our faces and I had an impulse to give him a kiss. He didn't seem to mind at all, and he made it plain by stroking my hair. At one stage he said to me, "When I've finished making you come, I want to be able to do it again."</p> <p>"Oh, I want to do that too, Socrates," I replied. "I'm ready for it again, if you are."</p> <p>"But if I come already," he said, "I'll have to stay inside you for very long."</p> <p>"Oh yes, Socrates, I am ready for that too. Are you too afraid to continue?" I asked.</p> <p>"Not at all. Of course, there are limits." He put his arms round me, and we kissed again. I felt his semen leave his cock and leak onto my stomach. He went over to my bed, and sat next to me. I felt him move one of my feet and spread it about. It felt good in his hand. "It will feel better with you moving over me," I said. "I think it will be pleasant."</p> <p>I felt him move back a little, and then take my foot in his hand. He ran his thumb over my feet. I felt a sudden surge of pleasure when this happened, and realized that he had now taken both of my feet in his hands, and was touching them in a way that I enjoyed. I hadn't imagined a man doing before him. It felt even better to have him.</p> <p></p> <p>When he was done in his hands, to have, he had, have also, toâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
