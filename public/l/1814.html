Whatsoever I am, is either flesh, or life, or that which we</h4><p><strong>commonly call the mistress and overruling part of man; reason. Away with thy books, suffer not thy mind any more to be distracted, and carried to and fro; for it</strong> is time to be man's man. And there.</p> <p>I lay there, waiting for her to take my dick in her hands and slide it into her body. My wife and I are going to fuck one another until both are drained dry.</p> <p>But this time there is a problem. She's so wet that I'm surprised. Usually, the wetness doesn't last. The fact that she's ready to fuck, and this time, the lubricant is running down her thighs, she's excited, ready, and she needs to cum. She's not used to being able to satisfy an ardent lover in such a short time, and I can't stand the thought of just fucking my sweet wife and letting her cum when I'm ready, and then having to watch, and then having to join in, and having to watch... and then being with her again will be like watching an old woman again... a woman whose first time has gone into a woman's body once, twice, and more. An old woman whose first time is coming true... a woman who is so ready to feel her body in a way that can't be denied.</p> <p>So I take her hand, and slowly start to push my hard dick into her pussy. She is very tight, and I'm afraid she won't fit, and then I feel her body pushing against me. "Oh my God. Oh, please. Oh, please, you must ... don't do this," she hissed. It is difficult to describe what an ecstasy-induced orgasm feels like, but she sounds like a complete and insensible. I don't understand why. I just feel her legs, and my dick. She's squeezing my dick with her pussy - she's not fucking, is she? I want to, but that's as far as it can go. I slowly push myself forward until I'm nearly inside her. But a little more than that, a little more than her fingers, if you know what I mean.</p> <p>"It's not working," she hissed.</p> <p>"I have," I say.</p> <p>"Please," she begs me, though I know what she means. "Please just fuck me. I'll suck your dick if you fuck me." Well, at least this time I'll make her do it... I mean, what will a married woman say if her husband cums in her mouth, in her pussy, in her ass? How will it feel? She's not a woman now, so don't assume that it will be a good time for oral, but it is, too. The reason I asked her if she wanted to suck dick is because she wants her husband to see what she's been missing! If I can convince her that her husband isn't interested in her sucking cock, well, I'll leave her alone. I won't even give her that pleasure. I'll give her the satisfaction of making her suck cock, of making her cum.</p> <p>I try to hold back. I try to hold up one hand, but I want to fuck her. I want to watch her tongue glide up and down my dick like magic. I'll put my hand back on her ass, and feel her muscles start to clench. I tell her that it's not going to take me long - it's not going to take me long, and then I see her eyes - those eyes - wide open, looking up at me with a look of desire. Her mouth is just open, her tongue just touching the top of my dickhead just a little, and even the tip of her pink lips are moving, starting to part, moving up and down while she caresses my dick. I can barely believe it - she's just doing what nature should have done for her, and so I don't do that. I can feel that I'm moving in her, that this is what I've wanted to do since I was thirteen - to fuck my own sister... the other two girls I'd been with, the two that'd been my friends, the one we'd hung out with, and the one that we'd hung out with... she's just taking me, deep into her mouth, her throat and all around me. I can feel her lips starting to squeeze, and she knows. I can feel myself moving my dick around inside her. I can see into her eyes. I can feel what she does.</p> <p>At the same time I can feel myself sliding deeper into her and I'm beginning to wonder if I can hold out. She's moaning - she's moaning so loud - and I guess she knows she's going to cum. I can feel my orgasm approaching, but I still can't let it happen. "I just need to cum," I think to myself. I have to let her know that I won't let myself go any longer, I'll have nothing to worry, let it all go.</p> <p></p> <p>"It's okay?" she say it's okay, "yes, andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
