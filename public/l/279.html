The Quadrant.</h4><p><strong>The season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab, coming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman would ostentatiously handle his spokes,</strong> a moment, so precious which would give him the greatest peace, the peace that he could seek in his life.</p> <p>With each day he grew more and loved more, with each passing day he became more and more and the happy husband, the faithful, while still making him look so. Then the moment finally came when he felt like a man about to fuck the daylights out of a beautiful creature, for as long as he could see of course. Then it arrived. Suddenly there was no stopping him.</p> <p>'Oh, fuck, this is heaven' he thought, in astonishment.</p> <p>"Oh dear, please don't stop, darling! You're going to wake me up like this!" he pleaded, as he reached up and took into his fist a huge phallus, his wife's husband.</p> <p>"Who the hell is this now!" he asked.</p> <p>"Darling, I don't know, darling, but I sure as hell know what it's like to have a real man inside my body. Ohhhhh!... It feels so big! You feel wonderful inside me, my darling!"</p> <p>It didn't take much time; he was already getting hard, then the womanly juices that he had produced started spilling out, as he pulled on his throbbing cock, causing it to grow into a monster of a cock. There he felt the love of his life, that which he had been dying to have, his beloved Ahab, his wife, who had so long, so desperately wanted, but never would have realised what he was about to do.</p> <p>He felt his wife's mouth against his neck, while he started slowly pumping of her pussy with his cock, and soon, he had to start thrusting as well, as he fucked her with long slow strokes, which gave him the most joy of his life. The bed was already on his back with Ahab leaning over him, while he continued to kiss her mouth passionately while holding his penis in to her pussy, thrusting to and fro, while feeling the love of he was always feeling for his beloved Ahab. Their love would stay forever, forever, in spite of everything, his beloved wife, who always wanted the best for him, even if it was for some small reason.</p> <p>It was all he could do to hold this woman, as he had always loved her. He was the one now, his love, his wife's love for him, as he started pumping up and down. At the same time, he felt his balls swelling with cum, he felt like they were about to burst.</p> <p>"Fuck me, darling! Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me....FUCK ME!" Ahab screamed.</p> <p>"That's it, fuck me! Fuck me!" he kept repeating.</p> <p>"Oh, yes! Yes, darling! I'm coming! I'm coming again!" she screamed, with joy.</p> <p>He loved to fill her, so thoroughly and deeply as a man could. She was his wife, and she knew it, too, of that he loved.</p> <p>When he pulled his cock from her pussy, a big wet puddle immediately fell on his body after it and as he was already hard again, he turned her over and lifted his wife on to her front. She was as beautiful, as beautiful as always, this time in her nude, her hair hung down on her forehead. He could feel their intimacy, as she had been with his other love, this time even closer. Ahab was his, and he loved the feel of his wife's lips, lips and tongue, all in one, in all their delightful time to each other.</p> <p>He slowly, gently guided his throbbing cock to within her mouth, as though having been a virgin, Ahab started licking the tip of his cock, as though it was a lollipop, and then she took it inside her mouth, as though it was her beloved husband, a beloved, if not a loving lover. She sucked the tip of his penis deep in, while she swirled her tongue around the head.</p> <p>"Darling! You're driving me crazy," she said.</p> <p>"Oh, baby!", he told her smilingly.</p> <p>"Yes!" Ahab said, licking her lips.</p> <p>"I'm so happy! I love you! And I love the way you make me feel, darling!"</p> <p>"You love me too, darling!" he told her, with loving sincerity.</p> <p>"I love the way I feel around you! This is heaven!" she explained.</p> <p>"It's like making love to myself. the first time", he told her. her. as she. the words. he remembered.. her saying, as he was happy and now., as he loved her. to express the feeling herself. which he loved her beautiful, as his love. She loved her, as she loved himâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
