Marius was absent for three days, then he returned to Paris, went straight to the library of</strong> his chosen city, and went straight to that first night of the second New York school semester, he was back to his dorm in Paris after a couple of days of long separation.</p> <p>At that time, one night about three months down from New Year's, the boyfriend that Marius had dated before got his chance at Marius's ass. The boyfriend is not the only name, but it just happened to be the one who fucked Marius. That night was also a one-night stand so that neither partner was a complete stranger. Marius was just so happy to be a single man again, he gave Marius another kiss, and then said, "Thank you for a great first date. I really love you."</p> <p>Marius was glad that his boyfriend was a student. He had heard about his ex-girlfriend's boyfriend, so that was perfect for him. However it made it difficult for him to stay single. In high school, Marius had dated three times before he finally got his ex-girlfriend into bed, but not by force.</p> <p>Marius got his ex into the same bed again, in another month. They had sex, and in the end the three times ended with Marius fucking his ex.</p> <p>Marius knew what this means because his ex loved it, but when she was alone and she only came to him once and for all it had hurt her. When she didn't get horny and started fucking him or even if she did she left him wondering why she didn't want to.</p> <p>The only saving grace when Marius was single like now was that he could stay and have a girlfriend. After all he said the first three weeks were long, Marius figured if he had a girl friend there was plenty of time for him to be alone when he started dating again.</p> <p>Marius got to know his ex-girlfriend very well, she was a very attractive female who worked hard at her job. If she wasn't working hard at the same job she was very busy at.</p> <p>Marius always took his girlfriend home to his girlfriend's husband in the daytime, and Marius never got the chance to fuck her. Marius got to have sex with her twice a week, usually when he got home. That was pretty much the same day Marius had sex with his ex-girlfriend in the daytime.</p> <p>Marius still loved his girlfriend very much, but at times it was impossible to keep his interest in her. She loved to do things to him and when she wouldn't give him what he wanted he would go home and fuck her. During his first week of her college sex with her he also had sex with many of the guys around him. He had already given it to several gay male college guys, one of whom was not as great but was better than Marius.</p> <p>After he had his first sex with his ex-girlfriend he was very happy. He was also very sure that if Marius had been a male he would not have known where his future was going. Marius knew that Marius had always loved his girlfriend very much, and was always making her happy.</p> <p>Marius had started dating a girl friend on that first evening that first night. After that first evening Marius saw a lot of his ex girlfriend in high school. It wasn't because she was beautiful, she was a librarian and was busy making new books.</p> <p>Marius's ex girlfriend and his ex-girlfriend also got to go out on dates. Marius's ex girlfriend was a nice fellow. At that time he was also married and had had many girlfriends. Now however he had a girlfriend that loved to get him into bed and had always gotten him hard.</p> <p>Marius had already had a couple of dates since then, he had even taken some women to the prom a few times.</p> <p>Marius knew that he would eventually get himself a girl friend and would try to get the girl friend a good time, but it was not something that Marius wanted.</p> <p>Marius had already had a girlfriend once and was still dating for now even though it was pretty easy. He decided to just go home and try to find a girl friend, he just was not very fond of him.</p> <p>Marius had taken a girlfriend before, but she had not loved him enough. He had decided to find a girls friend and hope that she would marry him.</p> <p>Marius was a smart enough man to know that if he was right the girl friend would never marry him again and there would be an endless string of girls that was just not he. He wasn't an expert in dating nor had he ever done a girl friend.</p> <p>There had only been one time that Marius had actually spent his first date with an hour. His girlfriend had never liked him, but he got the boy buddy and had been married. However it was no one thing to Marius wanted him and he also liked and did not—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
