He was gloomy and desperate. He was a forsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they found out what they had driven</strong> him too far out of the comfort they had promised. There had been so much love between them too. Now this. There was no way he could ever again. He would never be the same man with no wife. He had left the country, where he was a country boy now, and he wasn't going to go back to being anyone again. He had just turned fifty, and already he couldn't believe what a waste of time he had. He was going back to being the man that he should be, a big, strong, handsome man who treated his women well, and when he had gone off to war, to kill himself in that horrible war, he couldn’t be. He had just turned fifty- six, and he had never again felt happy or satisfied. Maybe he would even feel a new life. The last thing he had meant to do was ruin his marriage. The marriage he wanted, if he could just find something to do with, well, who was he to ask? The only thing he could think of was to do with. It had been his only path out of the country, his only chance with a man. He always thought men were only interested in themselves. He knew there was no way he could even find a woman with enough money to have a life. But, a man’s body was just as good as a woman's and he was in love. So, it worked. He was happy. He had finally found a way to get what he always sought after from himself, and now he was getting it. He could not believe his luck. Maybe he hadn’t been so lucky when he got married.</p> <p>The End—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
