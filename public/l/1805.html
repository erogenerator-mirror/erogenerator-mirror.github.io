From Alexander the Grammarian, to be un-reprovable myself, and not</h4><p><strong>reproachfully to reprehend any man for a barbarism, or a solecism, or any false pronunciation, but dextrously by way of answer, or testimony, or confirmation of the same matter (taking</strong> a deep breath through his teeth, and breathing slowly). He was a man, just so fucking long, and so thick, and so beautiful, and he knew where he stood. His cock was in my wife—my beautiful, beautiful, sexy, devoted, and utterly beautiful, wonderful, and glorious, and he deserved my permission for his own pleasure, for his to enjoy for hours in my wife's very intimate, intimate, and sacred sanctum. And the way he obeyed the will of me, and the wish of my permission in the eyes of the universe—by force of habit, and even by virtue of circumstance. She's my wife! For him!</p> <p>"C'mon, baby! Suck me, I'm just gonna fuck you, you know!"</p> <p>"Do it, you dumb bimbo! I need that pussy! I'll do anything! Use your pussy! I'll fuck you!"</p> <p>We'd been fucking for the last hour, and now it was time to fuck. She was still a little horny, as she'd pulled my cock out only to get my hard. She climbed on top and took me into her. She lowered herself, taking all of me into her, all but my head. Her labia were small, and so warm around my cock that I could feel it in the folds of her vagina. She held me there and began fucking me. I was in her. It was our first real fuck, my first truly sexual coupling, and it was the most loving, most sensuous, wonderful fuck imaginable. It was hot, dirty, and exciting. It was amazing! I could still feel her wetness, as I entered her, as we rose up, and it was so erotic, so beautiful. The way her hips rose when I penetrated her, and moved when I withdrew; the way my cock felt inside her, moving as she moved.</p> <p>We came. I went in her fast. Now, just the head of me was sheath in her, her vagina, her cervix, her vagina—everything there was inside her, and the rest of her. I felt her shudder as we came, and I felt her body shuddering as she felt me erupt even as she felt me erupt.</p> <p>It was like a fireworks display, so much pleasure and celebration, and I went hard again, I went hard, I went hard, I went all the way up in her. It was so wonderful. For her. For him. I don't know if he ever even felt his way into my wife's intimate depths, as if he could find pleasure in just the thought of that, or if he only felt pleasure, and he never said a word. When we came together again, hard and fast, I was just beginning to think about having this moment as a last touch, just as if I were taking the time just to be with my wife this night, to be her lover, her friend, her companion in life, even as I loved her, and wanted—and desperately do—the best of her, and not just to fuck.</p> <p>We did it. The fucking. She said she loved it! That it was special for her. That it was just fucking. I knew I loved what she was doing, and we weren't talking about the stuff we were talking about when it didn't work for us. She didn't understand it, no, she wasn't going to understand it. It was as if I was speaking to her, talking to her. And it was right! She understood that I loved fucking her! It had happened tonight with us. We had taken the first step into life, and it hadn't just happened, it had begun.</p> <p>She looked at the wall and I saw her head, as if the whole world could see it. She felt this. And I could only imagine the sensation it must have. We didn't just make love. We fucked. Hard. For me.</p> <p>"Well," she said, turning over and letting me lie down. "Was that what I imagined?"</p> <p>"It was good," I said. "You've got to feel good, like you did in the last few weeks, how you made me feel, how much you love me."</p> <p>"That was better than any fucking you've given me." She smiled at her own words, and then went to her bag. She brought back some new things: toys, a vibrator, some lube, some lubrication. And she laid them down on the blanket next to the bed, a couple of pillows behind her head. She smiled again and came back with a glass dildo, and handed it to me.</p> <p>"Would you like to try this, baby?" she asked. If I nodded, a little nod. We put them together. It was like I was. "yes." You wanted to her. . like it. "yes, yes."
