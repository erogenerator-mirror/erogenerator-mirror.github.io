The Island of Monte Cristo</h4><p><strong>Thus, at length, by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which sometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an evil destiny, Dantès was</strong> a happy ending for that of which our special agent of the year had been unable to deliver. He had to return there, and that was all his destiny was to see.</p> <p>When I left that particular establishment, you should have noticed that it was a short walk in the rain to my apartment. He must've been feeling like his car was a giant as it had nothing to do with the rainy weather.</p> <p>There was a lovely little Italian restaurant in my apartment on the top floor, adjacent to my bedroom. I liked it and wanted to be with him. I had to have him in me; I just had to. That's right. I'm a lucky agent who can do everything I could to make sure it's never going to end. I can make it a year of his life with the happiest day of her life and that's the way it started.</p> <p>And by the way, this is my true story, as told by my agent. I hope you enjoy it and remember to vote—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
