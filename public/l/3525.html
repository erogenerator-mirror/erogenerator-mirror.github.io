That which divinity has so divinely expressed to us—[“Vanity of vanities: all is vanity.”—Eccles., i. 2.]—ought</strong>n't be the true meaning of the word, since it was meant in very strange words, but that is to believe it. There is no truth in it.</p> <p>With me being a man, and my body having the form of a woman by now, and bearing my own wife and kids, I did not feel, or actually see things the way they are now. I felt nothing now, nothing but the pleasure of the moment. I felt the pleasure of giving pleasure to the woman I love, to express my appreciation to her for all her beauty and kindness.</p> <p>At the peak of that moment, the woman that loves me most, the most wondrously beautiful woman in the world (my mind says) and the woman who loved me most, was about to come. And I would do anything to come. I would give my wife to her for the sake of her body with her, without asking, knowing it could never be spoken. I would make her mine, in the way I do with my own body. Of course, I would ask if I could. I would ask my lady, too—or if I could be with her, in whatever way she wished! I would do anything to see what her body felt, how it felt, what she wanted. I would not do it without asking first.</p> <p>Her body's response to my cock was to go into spasms of orgasmic joy. For a moment the air went out of her. But then she resumed her movement. And so she did. When the first ripples of pleasure wracked her body she slowed to a halt, but as I was already there, I felt the next ripples of orgasm sweep through her. She stopped all motion. She kept moving.</p> <p>In no time, I could tell her to stop. I could feel her pussy squeezing and releasing my cock. She was coming, she was going to come! I had the control. She could continue her motion—even if she wanted to stop. She didn't. She continued her movements, even if she wanted to stop. For this time, all she was doing was moving to be still, that she could take what I had to give, and as long as I wanted, I could hold back as long as I wanted, or as long as I was sure she wanted. I held her hips tight in my hands, just feeling those waves of pleasure ripple through her again and again.</p> <p>But all that time passed, and I never felt the momentous, momentous end the first time before. For me.</p> <p>She didn't move, though. She just continued her fucking action.</p> <p>I was there, too—as soon as my body would take all its energy and my passion go, she would stop and move again. And she didn't, no. She started slowly and steadily, as though her heart was trying to slow her own racing heart, and her own mind and body to slow herself and her passion and to slow herself in spite of it. The thought, in me: that she would stop, this time and I would make her stop, and she would come to me.</p> <p>Then she stopped. She stopped. I was there, and my body was doing the same. There was no thought at all in that moment, not really. Not really, not really. This was an act, a simple act between us—a simple thing, in the world she owned, and she had no control over. And we were there—there were nothing there to give to me.</p> <p>Then she stopped. She started fucking again. But she didn't stop. She had a good rhythm going, with the beginning of her pleasure just a little slower and a little slower, a little slower. I knew that this was just the beginning. I could hold back my own body and my passion, and she wouldn't. But she was going to come, and she was going to come—and I could make her come. I wanted to do it, to take all my energy out of it and into her body. I did it, and the second-time, and it was the first. It was the first time we'd both had sex—so it was the first time either of us had done it before. And the first time we had had sex before. And neither of us cared. We had each other now—it was the first time, and it was the first time we had done it before. It was the first time we had kissed, first time they'd ever come together, the first time we'd ever had sex in the presence of her. And it was the first time we'd ever had sex the way I wanted it—together. And we had kissed, first had, and we'd kissed and we had fucked, as we both felt we knew we'd been going to be, just getting closer, the way our first, and then to each others bodies, and selves, and all the right—forever—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
