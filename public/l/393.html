Still less did he think of injuring anyone for his own advantage. He was merely a man of</strong> faith and he had the skills of an accomplished Christian.</p> <p>Beth was on her knees doing her best to please his hard penis with her mouth like she'd been doing for the last hour or two. Even though she hated to do it, she couldn't stop herself from wanting to feel his pleasure too. He must be quite a good cock sucker for that.</p> <p>Beth couldn't believe how talented she was at sucking his cock. Even though she liked sucking cock as much as she liked eating pussy, Beth felt quite disappointed when the man's penis abruptly began to throb, pulsing even more insistently. Her mouth was feeling tired, but she didn't care. She didn't even care he was going to cum in her mouth. She loved giving him pleasure.</p> <p>Beth didn't want to do it anymore. She was really tired and not thinking clearly. She had tried to give an orgasm with her hand, but what else in the universe could she do? For that matter, what was a man supposed to do with his penis?</p> <p>She didn't want to do anything more than suck it. The sight of a nice hard cock in her mouth excited her more than she'd ever thought. She wanted to taste as much as he did, but as much as sex with the man did might have excited her, it was something else she just didn't feel like doing it.</p> <p>Beth didn't even care what he did, just that she liked sucking cock, that she liked tasting as much as he did. She really did want to make love to the big, hard erection for as long as she could.</p> <p>Just then, his penis began to pulse even more firmly, spurting gobs of semen into the air in the direction of her face. The sight of semen splashing her face was just too hot, and yet she couldn't help but smile.</p> <p>Beth looked to him to beg forgiveness, but his eyes were fixed down below when he leaned close to kiss her. Beth wasn't sure whether her lips would ever be as soft as he made them out to be, but she was sure he liked her kissing him back. Their kiss was sweet and gentle and tender at the same time, even a little bit of the excitement of having a lover was long gone. It was just plain romantic. They'd just made love, not fucked, but love making made love.</p> <p>It was the kind of kissing Beth thought she would always remember. A kissing that promised more love but would never be the same.</p> <p>She felt a sense of melancholy at the thought.</p> <p>Beth was on her knees between his legs when he pulled her even closer to him. If she were on her knees at his feet, she could kiss him too, but she'd never do that at the moment.</p> <p>If she were on her knees between his legs, she could kiss him.</p> <p>As she knelt, Beth couldn't help wondering whether she would ever feel a man's penis pressed against her mouth.</p> <p>"Beth, kiss me!"</p> <p>Beth turned around on her knees on the couch so she could pull off his shoes and socks. Once they were out of reach for her mouth, she leaned her face close to his crotch and kissed the head of his cock. Then she gave the head of his penis a little kiss as she pulled his shorts off.</p> <p>Beth felt guilty for wanting to kiss him, but in spite of himself, Beth kissed her way up his long shaft. She was curious what it would taste like, but she could hardly taste it. It was just sort of like her panties, as if it were candy.</p> <p>While Beth's kisses got longer, her kisses started to become shorter. Each kiss, which got shorter, got closer and closer to him, until finally, Beth got a mouthful.</p> <p>Beth pulled off his penis with a gasp and looked up at him.</p> <p>"Sucking dick, Beth?"</p> <p>Beth grinned up at him. "Well, not really. I just try to please my man."</p> <p>"I guess that's no problem. It is kind of exciting to be with you," he said.</p> <p>"Oh?" Beth asked.</p> <p>"Well, you know I like sucking cock just as much as I enjoy it?"</p> <p>"You do?"</p> <p>"I sometimes find myself really enjoying sucking your penis, as well as kissing it."</p> <p>In a flash, Beth had reached for some tissues and wiped her face clean, before handing them to him.</p> <p>"Can I do the honors?" she asked.</p> <p>"Sure," he smiled.</p> <p>Beth reached down between her legs, grabbed his big strong hands, and took one by each holding his shaft in her free hand and gently kissed around his penis. With the inside of hers, she felt him inside her palm and on her palm and the outside of his shaft, one inside of it—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
