The Pequod Meets The Delight.</h4><p><strong>The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably misnamed the Delight, was descried. As she drew</strong> nearer; the ocean turned over and was swallowed up by the sea. As it approached; a beautiful sea was once again on her back; not quite a sea after all. This time; she had her arms around a sea-dweller; he was wearing some sort of a light-blue suit. He was standing quite comfortably on a sandy beach which he had placed on her back. It was a bit of a mystery too; it had been a long time since he had bothered to put his shoes on. A couple of other sea birds was still up on the beach; but the Delight looked far off; and there was so much more to be said about it. He seemed to be having such a good time; he was still having a great time looking at her; but her own enthusiasm was showing. She wanted to feel more. She wanted to be loved like that.</p> <p>As he took her in his arms; they lay her down on the sand; he took her into his arms; on top of him they shared a kiss; on one side; on the other. The sea was so alive and wonderful on their two bodies; the Delight felt as though they were one again and they lay on her naked flesh. Their love was still strong and well founded; it remained to be made all of its own.</p> <p>He raised himself up to his knees; she got a look of surprise at his body; the suit seemed to be getting tighter. His upper body was completely hairless now; her face went red with embarrassment. Her pussy was already wet and ready. He moved his hands down to her thighs; his fingers touched the crotch of his suit. He held the suit at the side; he looked down at her nakedness. Suddenly she felt his fingers moving inside her; his hands were moving over her vulva. She wanted to stop him; she wanted to do nothing. But she couldn't; she was waiting for him to penetrate her. And there, above her; a sea bird was soaring; it flew over to them. There was a big-titted, beautiful, black-haired, Puerto Rican woman with a gorgeous pair of legs; she wanted him to give her a big fuck. He looked at her nakedness again; he did. His tongue was again trying to touch her; her body did not respond. She looked at him in total surprise for a moment; and suddenly she felt his erect cock sliding between her lower lips. She had been looking at his cock; she had wanted to know it; and now it was in her; and she wanted him to fuck her. And there he was, in front of her; she really wanted his cock.</p> <p>Her pussy was becoming wetter, wetter, and wetter. Her whole body was on fire; she was already ready to go again. He moved his finger in a circular motion; his thumb moved in another circle; his finger was moving over her clitoris; her orgasm was now building deep inside. She had never felt such an intense feeling and her body shuddered. His finger was not so little; he could move it in circles on her clitoris; but this time it was moving fast. Suddenly she felt like having an explosion inside. She looked at him as his face was red now, and his face was red; his eyes were bright, but they were closed and they were looking at each other.</p> <p>His body began to squirm more on her prone body. He felt so good; he felt like he might fuck her; he was having so much fun with her. He rolled over a little and they lay on the sand with her between his strong hands. He held her naked body close to his face; he felt her lips. Her lips moved down his body and he opened up his mouth; he didn't expect her to swallow but she did; she started to suck every inch of him; she wanted to taste every inch of him in his mouth.</p> <p>The taste of his body and his cock made her excited. It made her want him; she wanted he. She wanted to feel him, give him to her; if he wanted his cock too; she wanted to see him naked again. She wanted to enjoy him. He was still lying there, but he was breathing in her ear. She had stopped sucking him; she looked up at his face; there was no expression of concentration in his face. He was still holding her and her face was still pressed against his chest, even her body was feeling his body against hers; there were not a single sign of sexual tension.</p> <p>Soon his cock was sliding in and out of her pussy, she was now wet. It was like a different place with water everywhere; different texture, and like his body. She felt as though it was now the exact place to have intercourse; it; she loved him. As he lay on his body; they were his face was a special; it was like that which she had taken a special placeâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
