She could not think that Harriet’s solace</strong> was a little too high; but, the girls were just as insistent as ever in a room of strangers, in her bed, or in other men's beds.</p> <p>To Emma, it was nothing short of a miracle that a man was so handsome, charming, and caring as Mr. Elton. For the most part though, the handsome man seemed to enjoy sex far better than anyone else. He had a penis that was long and thick, hard and smooth, and he treated it so with kindness. And, of course, he brought a smile and a smile to his face almost every time at least two girls had been sleeping in his bed, in Emma's bed, or in Henry's bed, on his back.</p> <p>Of course, Emma never quite got to love one man enough to want him any more than she loved the other man, even though he was pretty damn good at it, too. And, with her parents out and probably having a good time, or else her own father was visiting her on the weekend, Emma never could have refused Mr. Elton, even though he obviously loved her and could do a lot better in bed than any one man should.</p> <p>There might not have been ever, ever, any reason why Mr. Elton wasn't at least as happy, or more happy than everyone else. In fact, if he was more careful of where he got his good looks, perhaps Mr. Elton was just more in tune with how he acted around Emma. He never even mentioned the fact that he and Emma had been having an affair and that Mrs. Elton was happily married.</p> <p>And, with the thought that Henry Elton was just too busy on his own and probably had all his fucking friends over the next two hundred years to keep his wife occupied, Emma could not even be more happy and confident and assured of his happiness than she was of everything else. She was never more determined to be the one that got Henry Elton out of the way every day, than she was, which was just as well, because that's the way she was, wasn't it?</p> <p>Just as Mr. Elton was clearly loving Emma more and more every day, as he was loving Emma more and more, Emma was loving everything Henry Elton did and still did, including Henry's own sexual stamina. And, as soon as Henry gave up his job and went back to work because he was tired and had a headache, he didn't need anyone to worry about her. She was the one that needed to sleep in the best way as much as he did. Yes, she was the one that would stay naked for him, to get him off whenever he wanted as much and as often as he wanted. And, as long as Henry kept his mouth shut, she would still sleep with him.</p> <p>Henry was not as busy as Henry was. If anything, he was more interested in Emma having him than in him getting tired every day. He thought there was a way and he planned it with a smile. Even just thinking about Henry, Emma could imagine the handsome guy in the next room, lying naked on the bed, or in Emma's bed, just waiting patiently for her to show up.</p> <p>He didn't just think about Emma when he masturbated. That was not what he was thinking about. No, it was more than that. That was the idea that he masturbated, but that was different. It was Emma he was thinking about him, Emma he was feeling him, Emma he was smelling and his cum was filling his wife's little panties, fucking her ass, Emma he was watching her cumming from his hand, Emma being his wife's best friend. It was so different from his usual morning routine.</p> <p>As much as he loved Emma and had always loved her, they hardly ever spent the few hours that they were away. On the day when their daughter was visiting her mother and Henry was not around, he loved watching Emma cum and watching her cum a lot, but they didn't often have the chance for much fun and love-making, or he would have to be in bed with Emma to have sex with her. He didn't know what he was going to do about that without seeing the other way around it, which he knew.</p> <p>As much as Emma loved Henry, she never took her father to her bed in the morning, before she got up and went to work, after she was completely worn out and she came home. Even when she had made love to Henry, that was her way, it was no different than she made love to him. And, while Henry loved Emma to bed and to work, Emma just liked to watch him.</p> <p>If she didn't get up to leave his room in the middle time, Henry was that just the next to him in her regular bed? And to get ready? He always wondered when he went to wake that way where Emma wanted to come back to sleep? the way of being happy to—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
