They walked softly, as men do instinctively at night. The lamp cast fantastic shadows on</strong> the dark hallways as they passed on.</p> <p>The moment was too good to be true.</p> <p>The lights went dim as they made their way down his lithe body, over his stomach to his thick, beautiful cock. This was definitely not how men and women spent their nights. Basil Hallward groaned in need. No man ever looked at him in the same way that he did tonight. He'd been in many different positions, over the span of months, and none came close to the magic moment tonight...</p> <p>"You ready for some hard cock?" a feminine voice asked.</p> <p>And then Basil Hallward moaned a nervous little 'no', "fuck me."</p> <p>And there was the beautiful angel seated behind his angelic face, her face covered in pink, her slender fingers teasing his rock-hard shaft before her glacial lips began sucking him off. There was no pretense at all. What does a woman do differently from a man, he wondered?</p> <p>"God yes," was his answer as her warm mouth enveloped his dick, sliding it up and down as she pleasured his hot shaft. The image went through his mind as he had never imagined doing porn until now. This angel in front of him was beautiful, sexy, and incredibly beautiful. Everything he'd imagined in his wildest dreams could come true. Just from his gorgeous angel. For him.</p> <p>As the gorgeous angel with the most seductive smile and sensual laugh continued to suck Basil Hallward's cock, he leaned forward and pressed his lips against her soft lips. They were like the first time he ever kissed a woman: soft, tender, and incredibly sensual—and yet so much more as a whole than just about, as the two lovers had planned. And here they both were, each kissing the other's face and body: hands roaming all over each other's body, loving it.</p> <p>Basil Hallward's hands grabbed the bottom of angels lovely face as the angel slowly slid her mouth up and down his rock-hard tool; he loved feeling her lips on his cock as she went along. Their bodies moved together as the two lovers passionately made out in the beautiful dimness.</p> <p>All the fantasies had come true tonight—and yet they were even stranger than they'd planned.</p> <p>When Basil Hallward's hand drifted down to cover the angel's pretty face against the soft, sensual fabric of those angel's dress, he knew that he would make the right choice.</p> <p>They kissed once more: so very tenderly and with an intensity that surprised everyone in the house, but then Basil Hallward turned them onto their sides and slid his dick inside the angel's gorgeous pussy.</p> <p>"No," was the first reaction from as soon as Basil Hallward's fingers slid under the angel's silky dress and caressed her nipples between his fingers as he fucked her with the softest and the hottest thrusting he'd ever felt in his wildest dreams.</p> <p>"I want you," he whispered sweetly in her ear, "I want you..."</p> <p>"Say those three little angel things in my ear," she breathed softly into his neck, "do that..."</p> <p>Basil Hallward's eyes rolled back into his head. "Yes!"</p> <p>"Then say them right now you horny little angel."</p> <p>"Oh...my...God..."</p> <p>"Say them..."</p> <p>"Oh my God..."</p> <p>"Say yes angel, or I don't want you to, or you will...or I do."</p> <p>"Then I'd better say 'yes'..."</p> <p>"Say the ones he loves..."</p> <p>"Oh God, please! Now I...oh God..."</p> <p>"Say 'yes' and 'no' to me!"</p> <p>"Oh yes, please!"</p> <p>"Say it to me..."</p> <p>"Say yes, oh god...and...please..."</p> <p>"Say 'no'..."</p> <p>She gave him a quick kiss right in his ear, causing his dick to jump even harder when he did, just as it had many times tonight. She loved it so much. And she loved it enough to have said it.</p> <p>"No, wait...do it, please!" she insisted as she started to suck his dick more intensely into his girlfriend's mouth.</p> <p>"Yes," he breathed as he felt the angel's tongue wrap around his taut shaft, taking his pre cum juice with it. She was amazing, he loved fucking angel's mouth with his cum juices. The only way to describe it was to picture it in his mind. He wanted it so bad he could taste it, for the second time tonight, but he could feel it instead as he was thinking about his angel. Because of her, so damn it was her. "loving, now!</p> <p></p> <p>The angel's how? I love, what! ?</p> <p>'n't to my love—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
