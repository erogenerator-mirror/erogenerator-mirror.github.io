Some things hasten to be, and others to be no more. And even</h4><p><strong>whatsoever now is, some part thereof hath already perished. Perpetual fluxes and alterations renew the world, as the perpetual course of time doth make the age of the world (of</strong> men), the ages of age, by God. Or, at least, that's how I'd like it to be.</p> <p>"Oh fuck." That was a bit too optimistic, but we all know the answer. It was okay for me to continue, since it's been all my fault. I can't wait to do it again.</p> <p>"Come here, bitch." That's what Mom says.</p> <p>I have to remind myself to be quiet again. I feel myself going to the edge, ready to sink to the depths. The world's gone, for all that you know. Everything is right with the world, but as I say it will come with the price. I'm not even sure why. I can have your hair cut short again next summer. I can fuck your neck again next spring. I can fuck your butt and your vagina. You'll have your ass back in time. I can go all the way and make your cunt scream for pleasure. I can do everything else.</p> <p>"Take me." It's all for this. I'm a bitch who needs to be fucked to remember. This is the moment to get back to a straight forward, normal, boring, boring, boring. It's not even over yet. I'm being made to feel superior, so I'm going to push that away. This is my second time being spoken to, not mine.</p> <p>"Oh God." That was a bit too optimistic. My heart started beating again. For just a second, I wondered if we actually were talking like old married friends. In another few minute, I'd think twice but she's back in her office. Her secretary, right now. Maybe she's just on her lunch hour. Probably just not in any hurry. She's supposed to be here until after ten-ish!</p> <p>"My office, please..." I start. She doesn't even have the time of day. I mean, what does she get with that?</p> <p>"Right now," she replies, "my cunt is a tight cunt. Just ask me for permission to go down. That's enough paperwork. Now come down."</p> <p>The only time we speak is when we fuck. I'm not a man. I don't enjoy the sight of a pussy while it's still as tight as a woman's. If you can call it that as a cunt, maybe it is not such a disgusting feeling in that it doesn't even have to be that. The way I taste isn't bad. It's really nice and soft. It doesn't matter if a pussy is loose-lipped now, or if an office cleaner is about to bend over a desk in a room full of people. It's no good to complain about the taste while it's still dripping wet - or better yet, it's even better. The taste is different. The smell. I can smell the juices from a pussy a mile away. And the smell isn't the most pleasant or pleasant smell any man can go off in, but I bet my husband's a fool not to love his wife more than he loved himself, to throw her over his shoulders and fuck her ass over and over and over and over like a man.</p> <p></p> <p>(Please note that this was a bit after Dad's first time.
