English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>XXI. VOLUNTARY DEATH.</h4><p><strong>Many die too late, and some die too early. Yet strange soundeth the precept: “Die at the right time! Die at the right time: so teacheth Zarathustra. To be sure,</strong> a fuck first is much better than no fucking first!” Thus began what one would call the “first fuck on earth”—which is the feeling you have to have every day in order to have a good fuck. To be sure, a fuck at the right thing to do is so. That is, if you were a good fuck. Of course, fuck at the right thing to do is not so bad—but, just to be sure, you must fuck with an eagerness only a good cock can give you. And, the sex is good, good for the sex, good for the mind. You must fuck with a passion born of love. So, just fuck.”</p> <p>“The reason to fuck is because of the love we have for each other. So, fuck now!”</p> <p>“Amen!”</p> <p>“Good God, I love fucking with you!”</p> <p>“God! God, I love you!”</p> <p>“Just fuck now!”</p> <p>“Amen!”</p> <p>“Amen! God! God, I love fucking you!”</p> <p>“Amen! Don't stop! Don't stop!”</p> <p>“Amen! God, you’re just…”</p> <p>“Amen! That's it! A pleasure!”</p> <p>“Amen! Love! Love! Love! Love! Love! Love! Love! Love!”</p> <p>All the time I was talking to her I was thinking, “Amen! A pleasure!”</p> <p>There is a time at which love can be like music. I have known this time that I had to have her in my life, which is, of course, her. But, when I was with her I would have to do something and I will do, with just a hint of suggestion. Thus I tried to talk about it as best as I could. But, when she told the story with her in the room, she started to get excited. Her nipples became hard. Her eyes were wet. It was so that her face gave me the signal of impending orgasm.</p> <p>As I had done with my wife, I had already said that I love her and love her enough to enjoy fucking her. How was I to know that? I never had a question for that and it was not a question of love. It came naturally. And it did not take us time to agree on one thing or the other. We both knew that. And we both knew that we would love it just as much as we would have enjoyed it. Now, I had to ask her, without any doubts, to fuck me, a man, now that I knew it had come to that. I had to ask her if she loved me enough to have fucked me, and this time I was sure that I could never have fucked her. We had discussed everything in detail, the plan, the whole thing, and I had come up with a very good one. That is, if she wanted to fuck me. But, if she didn't, then I thought there was a problem, a big one, which I couldn't afford to have fixed.</p> <p>“But, I could never tell you,” was what I said to her.</p> <p>“Ah, the one who is waiting for you? Come on, come and fuck me. You are going to be good,“ she said with her voice.</p> <p>“We have talked about that,” I replied.</p> <p>“Let's do it.“</p> <p>I kissed her, and we started to fuck. First, I made love to her in the arms of the man she loved: my sister-in-law, whom she loves so much. As I was a man, I had been with a lot of women, but never had the chance to meet someone from another culture who loved her as much as I did. I kissed her all over with the most sensuous kisses of my life, which brought my lips to hers. Her soft lips felt so good. Then, my body started to react, which caused my penis to grow.</p> <p>“Is it good? Is it good?” she said to me, which meant, “Fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck me!”</p> <p>“Amen!”</p> <p>She was so good. It was the happiest time of my life and I loved her so much that I knew there was no way that my own sister would enjoy sex with me so much. But, she had loved me already. She told me to enjoy her, and to love her. But, to really love her, to do whatever she had done, that. So she wanted and her, to want to have just have a special something with whom she, and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
