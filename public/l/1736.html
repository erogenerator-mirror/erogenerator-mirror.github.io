On the spectator’s right a two-story house runs back from the proscenium—a door towards the front, a second-story window towards the back. Across the back</strong> is a walkway from the street—like any other home, it’s a block of rooms. We can see a light that is on and close it off.</p> <p>I sat down on a couch, near the back, as the curtains were drawn to a side. I had no idea why it was so dark. I could see a man and woman walking down the street. I heard the sounds of high heels and the clicking of heels. As I got into it, I could hear that he was nude, and his hands were on someone’s breasts. As my gaze moved up his body, he turned toward the house again, taking off his coat. This time the man was on a bed. He was in the middle as he was fucked. He’s still nude, but his pants are around his ankles. One of his hands was working into the woman’s ass.</p> <p>My mind wandered about as I watched those hands fuck in the dark. I wondered what it would be like if I could fuck another man while watching him fuck another woman. But then his hands were off of the woman. And he had the woman on her hands and knees. His cock in her ass, his balls across her mouth. One hand was on her pussy and then he was fucking her. And he was coming in her ass. I’m sure the woman was gushing—a lot, really.</p> <p>I heard the moans I had waited so long to see. I couldn also hear the cries—a symphony of moaning and groaning in rhythm with the fucking going on. I’m sure these were not the first sounds I’d heard in my life! The couple was so into it that the sounds of fucking were loud and clear, and they were fucking like animals in heat.</p> <p>Then the woman’s body dropped to the floor and the man turned her against the wall, and held her down on her hands and knees as the man got on top of her. Then the man fucked her from behind. I guess I just looked through the window to see what was going on down there, but it was so dark, I could not tell.</p> <p>Then the man moved in front of her again. She opened her mouth, and he shoved his cock in it and started fucking into her mouth. She was choking as he pushed his way in deeper. I realized that he had some kind of big vibrator. I saw the woman’s hands on the stranger’s cock, and the strangers balls against her pussy.</p> <p>He was moaning, the woman was moaning, “Ohhhh, yesss…” the guy was humping his dick into the older woman’s mouth, my wife and I watching, and it appeared like the man fucked her for thirty minutes.</p> <p>I couldn’t take it anymore. I came up behind the woman on the floor of the man’s living room. She looked at me and smiled. Her eyes were closed as she went through some kind of orgasm. This must be what you’ve been waiting for.</p> <p>I stood up off the couch and walked over to her. I had to put my cock in her face as I walked so she could taste me. She smiled at me. I rubbed my cock through her lips and into her mouth. That’s when we knew it was time. So I pulled down her skirt and grabbed her panties and yanked them off. Then I put her hand down her pants and put her on the ground, and she fell down onto her front, spreading her legs.</p> <p>“I want you to know that all women have their needs,” I said. “Do you?”</p> <p>“Yes,” she said, and she spread her legs so I could get to her pussy.</p> <p>I licked and sucked on her while she moaned and called a good job. “Your husband’s only cock does that to you!” I said. She spread them apart, so I could run my tongue up and down her pussy lips and then inside her. I slid my tongue in and out, making sure to lick her clit with my tongue. I felt like I was tasting a fruit of some forbidden fruit. There was not a dry spot on her pussy.</p> <p>I felt it start to get moist, and I felt the person’s tongue start to slide in and out of her cunt. It was the same way a cock was doing its job, but now it seemed to have a tongue that was doing something besides fucking. It seemed to be fucking her pussy—something. It was like it was going in and out from the walls. It felt like there was no where it was. As if it was not anywhere in. It almost, in. Her breathing, all of my tongue inside of my—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
