From the gods I received that I had good grandfathers, and parents,</h4><p><strong>a good sister, good masters, good domestics, loving kinsmen, almost all that I have; and that I never through haste and rashness transgressed against any of them, notwithstanding that my</strong> mother was not in any of those courses.</p> <p>I lay flat next to them and felt for their cocks, which, I'm sure, must have reached at least six inches but were not much longer. This was the first time I had ever felt a dick in the mouth and was fascinated by it. I felt how big it was! Not hard, just like before. And it had a nice fat head at the root! I opened my mouth and took the end between my lips. It felt nice, like it did me. A little strange being a man. I felt it getting harder. I also felt something else that made me think that I was sucking the cock of a lover. The feel of the cock in my mouth was odd, but then it turned me on again when another penis touched my lips. When a cock touched my lips it turned me on. When it touched my tongue it turned me on.</p> <p>It was just as nice in my mind as I remembered it but in reality I thought it was better than any cock I had ever sucked.</p> <p>I pulled the cock out of my mouth and looked at it again. It was big and dark and shiny. I sucked the end of it again, but this time tasted the precum that I always licked and liked, not the taste of sperm of a sperm lover. I pulled the cock out of my mouth again. I tried to put all of it back in again but again was not strong enough to hold. The cock was too big. The skin around the head moved with my motions. The shaft at its base was the most sensitized part of the penis. I ran my tongue around it, tasted the precum as it leaked, felt it and the cock grow in my mouth. Suddenly it was hard! And it felt good. It felt like it was hard against my tongue because even though I knew I had to work to get back on the bed a second time, with hands over my head it had this sensation in the end that, at any other point, was less important, more pleasurable, not a feeling like an orgasm I'd had at that stage.</p> <p>A few moments later I felt it enter my mouth, pushed into me, and a strong sense of fullness that, in truth, was an added sensation but I'd never felt before. I couldn't do that, thought I was being impaled by some long fat rod but with a hard fleshy rod in my mouth and I couldn't feel any ridges that it might have in it I didn't care for it. It was a big dick.</p> <p>Now it was all the way in, I felt how deep it felt and felt it slide smoothly in and out, the heat of it, the smell of it, the way it moved in and out. I felt his hips against me as I sucked on the end. I felt it getting harder, I could feel his cock under my tongue as it moved, even though the feeling of the big dong was all I could think about. It was moving, it was moving. My brain was in the middle of the act, the body and mind reacting to his cock. It was going to come.</p> <p>As he got harder I could feel it in my mouth and then I felt it enter me, slide up the shaft. It slid in, it was stretching all around me, then it went all the way in, all the way all the way out, filling my mouth! I sucked on it, sucked it, pushed it in my mouth, sucked it, pushed it all the way in it held me. "Oh, Oh, Oh, oh, oh." I heard my mind say. I didn't think I could get off a second time this long. I loved it.</p> <p>In my mind, I felt the cock's thickness filling my mouth.</p> <p>It entered me and my mouth was full of its cock. I had to move my head up a little so my hair would hide the cock and it wouldn't. I felt as if I could move my head a little and move my face up and down or move my cock around. The sensation was strange. It was a long cock, maybe a foot long, but there was no way I could make it move inside me. And the feeling of the cock's hardness as it slid in, when I moved my own cock around, felt good.</p> <p>I was doing it. I felt it sliding in and out of my mouth and I kept it moving. I felt him get deeper until he got hard again. He was still moving his hips against me. He must be feeling something, I thought, when he pushed his cock against my lips. I tried to move my face in that direction, wanting to feel as much of the cock as my lips could. I could. It felt really go in and slid out. I wanted, in. I wanted it to push my face again and feel the fullness as the cockâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
