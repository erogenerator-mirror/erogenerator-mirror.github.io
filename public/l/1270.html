The Abbé’s Chamber</h4><p><strong>After having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage, which, however, did not admit of their holding themselves erect, the two friends reached the further end of the corridor,</strong> just outside the bathroom.</p> <p>Molly was a very tall, long-legged brunette girl with long brown hair. She had medium sized breasts, and her smallish hips, but her smooth legs... well, if nothing else, she was the first time Megan had seen a vagina, and had been attracted to it. Though it would take too much for people to appreciate a vagina, Molly found herself actually enjoying Megan's nudity.</p> <p>Molly had enjoyed being on the receiving end of an even longer cock, as well as having a cock to enjoy so many new pleasures.</p> <p>Megan had been enjoying her new found fortune, as well as Molly. When Megan had made her decision, Molly had gone to Megan and removed her own dress. Now Megan was no longer the shy girl from backseat, but a sexually adept, experienced, talented young woman, and she had been pleased that Megan had shown respect.</p> <p>For Megan, this experience was not an achievement by any means. Although the most popular girl at the college had only been in her first three years of college, she was the main attraction, and her boyfriend enjoyed Molly's talent as well.</p> <p>Megan had been impressed by Molly's abilities, in that she had performed miracles, performed as many other gymnasts and singers did, and had managed to do the splits for the first time in her life.</p> <p>Megan's experience of performing this same miracle, however, was the most extraordinary she had ever been. She had never seen a penis or vagina up close, and she had actually felt like Megan's experience of pleasure, though she never considered herself to be lesbian.</p> <p>Even during her first act with another person, she had found herself enjoying her partner's body more than just as a friend; indeed, she now had a feeling of closeness to someone she knew that she would never be able to do anything like, for example, Megan.</p> <p>This new experience was certainly more powerful than anything she had ever thought, or would have liked.</p> <p>The experience of Molly, and Molly alone. That night, she would make Molly one of her best friends, and, if needed, would even have fun with her. She wanted Molly to be a little girl with some sense of self-preservation, and Megan would be her best friend.</p> <p>But, as their first time, Molly had already shown all her new skills once again, and the experience was even more amazing than before.</p> <p>Megan had enjoyed being sexually stimulated. She had enjoyed feeling like Molly had enjoyed herself. She had felt that Molly was being completely uninhibited, both to what she and Molly did together, and also to what they did with other people.</p> <p>Molly knew how Molly thought. She could read minds and emotions through her eyes. She could read thoughts, thoughts that could be read in others. She knew Megan had similar thoughts.</p> <p>Megan had only known she had the capacity, and confidence, and drive. She could do things she would never be able to do with someone she had never even talked to anyone else, but never been able to understand.</p> <p>She was the same kind of self-conscious girl who had had sex with just about every man that she had ever known, even taking up with her ex-boyfriend. She knew Molly was not gay, she knew she wasn't a lesbian, she knew Molly had never had sex with any of the other men she had had sex with. She, and Molly, had been lovers.</p> <p>Molly knew Molly was the kind of girl that had had sex with other men.</p> <p>And now Megan was a very beautiful woman, a beautiful girl.</p> <p>Molly was also a very confident, adventurous, horny girl who, after all, had been sexually active with the two girls for more than twenty years. It had been more than two decades since her first time with a real man, and Molly knew that she had never experienced sexual pleasures like what she was about to experience with Megan.</p> <p>That is, had never actually done anything like that before. And, to be fair, she had not. And it had been all new to her.</p> <p>As Megan walked towards her friend's bathroom, this time looking a bit like all the others Megan had been with, that was the first time Megan had ever actually looked at another woman's body. Her first ever experience with others would be with another woman.</p> <p>Molly had never done anything sexual, and she was still nervous about that. She had only touched another girl with her hands, and only had been in the dark of a room. But she was now looking very closely, and she had discovered Megan's nude body, her smooth legs, the firm round bottom, her small face. And even just for comparison.</p> <p></p> <p>Molly just the thought of being naked.</p> <p>She was in that she had never touched Megan's not touched a lesbian as a girl in the feeling of sexual—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
