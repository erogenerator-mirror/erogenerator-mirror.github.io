The Prison Register</h4><p><strong>The day after that in which the scene we have just described had taken place on the road between Bellegarde and Beaucaire, a man of about thirty or two-and-thirty, dressed</strong> in a black slacks cap, a black tank top and black leather jacket with a gold belt buckle, with a crisp white shirt tied at the top. He was, as was the rest of him, black. And when he saw us, we had a special effect on him. He was wearing a smile. And he was smiling. He was proud. We kissed. We touched. Our hands were all over. He was kissing. Our bodies were dancing together, we were both touching ourselves. We pulled each other's shirts from our bodies, rubbed our hands over our boobs, kissed each other, all the while he watched us, and then we kissed, and he kissed, and we kissed and kissed. Then we kissed. He kissed our foreheads, our forehead. His hands wandered across our bodies from our backs and shoulders to our hairless cocks, which was sticking out of his jeans and I was feeling so horny for him. Then he did the same on mine. We rubbed our breasts, tweaked our nipples. We were each moaning. We took off our shirts and threw them on the floor. He was looking at our eyes. "What's up?" I didn't really care though. I wanted him. He needed this. He wanted me badly. He told us so. We were so horny from this experience.</p> <p>Then he started kissing himself with those lips of his. Then he did too, and he started kissing back and he told us how he really does want us. He wanted us. He wanted us. We were kissing and rubbing ourselves right in front of his face. He told us how he loves to suck tits while he slides his big cock into us, and we were fingering ourselves.</p> <p>"Are you sure you haven't done this before?" We whispered in unison.</p> <p>"No. Really. I've been practicing these things for a while. But you, I really love to see you, and I have never done things like this before, okay? I'm sure I haven't done this before. This was different. But I just can say that with you. There is no question about what's right for you, because you really do love to have your tits sucked on. It's just the way we're wired. Are you okay with that?"</p> <p>"Yes. Oh yes, I'm okay with it. This is great. I just couldn't resist it when I knew what you wanted."</p> <p>"Then we're happy too. I know you want them to be sucked a lot more than this."</p> <p>"Yeah, I think you're right," I said with a laugh.</p> <p>He was sitting next us, and there was absolutely nothing I could say to him except "Oh yes. It feels so good when your teeth gently dig into my nipples," or "Oh yes. That feels so fucking good." I think he thought I was getting hot for something or other just because of the way that he was looking at us and feeling our bodies.</p> <p>"Do you want to touch yourself?" He asked.</p> <p>"Not really," I answered, but he smiled in that way I couldn't get away with just saying "no."</p> <p>He moved away from us, away from the bed, and he stood up, moving to stand right in front of us, and I followed immediately. He took off his shirt and pants, then his underwear, and was naked. He looked so sexy with his sexy big cock hanging there and it stood out over nine inches, thick and long, and it was all hard and gleaming with his pre-cum.</p> <p>Now I was really hungry for him. He moved down over my face. I looked up into his eyes. He had such big lips and so pink he looked even more beautiful when he was really looking at us. I was going to eat him right now.</p> <p>"Let's do it in the bedroom, too," I said eagerly.</p> <p>"Let's do it out there for you to enjoy," he said.</p> <p>"But what about the audience?" I asked.</p> <p>"What audience is that?" he said.</p> <p>"Let's show you what you can do."</p> <p>I got on the bed. He got on as well, and we embraced in a passionate kiss with our tongues dancing and our hands moving all over each other's bodies, feeling our taut skin, pressing against each other and then moving down each shoulder and then across to their heads and then back up again.</p> <p>He moved down my body as well, kissing his way down my breasts and licking them, sucking each of our hard nipples, kissing his way between us and then down again to my groin. He was just hovering there, looking at my shaved lips, watching my body, and knowing that I was so hot and that I was the way the way. He was the way to be.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>And what you could be it could be felt and howâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
