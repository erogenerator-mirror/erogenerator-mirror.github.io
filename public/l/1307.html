A Flurry in Stocks</h4><p><strong>Some days after this meeting, Albert de Morcerf visited the Count of Monte Cristo at his house in the Champs-Élysées, which had already assumed that palace-like appearance which the count’s</strong> sons looked so dashing in. His wife didn’t appear at first. The count smiled as a dark-skinned and dark-haired Spanish woman approached. Her name was Cecilia, but Albert thought her name sounded like a dream, and she seemed so perfect in his eyes. She wore a pale-blue top-dress with an almost-transparent fabric, and Albert couldn't resist caressing the rounded shape of her breasts as Cecilia talked. As Cecilia walked past, Albert could only stare at her long, tan legs as she entered, and in her black sandals, he could just see her sexy ass.</p> <p>„You look lovely, Cecilia. You must be so beautiful.”</p> <p>„Why thank you, sir.”</p> <p>„Why don’t you come into my office.”</p> <p>„Yes, sir, I may."</p> <p>Cecilia led her husband to a very large, very hard-on room where an ottoman and chairs were arranged around some kind of rectangular stage.</p> <p>“Do you have anything sexy for me, sir?”</p> <p>“Oh I have all sorts as well.”</p> <p>„I want you to undo my shirt. Now.”</p> <p>While she unfastened his tie, she unbuttoned his shirt, and then pulled it over his head to reveal his dark skin underneath. Cacilia didn't feel him against her body for a minute as he stood there, his arms behind his head, hands at his sides, completely open, staring at her.</p> <p>“Now kiss the side of my neck.”</p> <p>Cecilia’s eyes narrowed as she complied. She wanted him to kiss her like her husband did. Albert slowly kissed Cecilia’s neck, moving his lips to the center where her throat was, then finally moved to her breast. When Cecilia felt his warm, cool lips make contact with her nipple, she closed her eyes and arched her back and moaned.</p> <p>She was surprised that her husband’s dick had never touched her there before: this man’s mouth felt so nice and soft. He must have taken care not to kiss so many places. He had kissed her on her neck for a long time before, she noted. His mouth was so soft and inviting, and when he kissed her there, she was sure she wished he would continue.</p> <p>Eventually, Cecilia’s husband reached the bottom of her breasts and he slowly kissed the top of her breasts, then he went to other parts of the body, kissing and licking everywhere, sucking on her nipples.</p> <p>“Oh, you have such lovely lips, Cecilia. They feel so nice on my neck. So smooth, like silk. You are so hot, darling.”</p> <p>She was really hot now, but maybe he’d gone too far.</p> <p>„Oh, god.”</p> <p>Cecilia turned her head to see her husband’s penis poking out at the fly of his jeans.</p> <p>“Oh, yes. I am such a tease. Please, go on.”</p> <p>When Cecilia reached the bottom of the room, her husband looked at her and smiled. She pulled away her fingers from her nipples to unbuckle him, then sat down on the soft ottoman while turning to one side. He was sitting close to the ottoman, facing her, her small back to his chest. Cecilia unbuttoned his shirt and her husband took his cue, doing the same with her. They leaned back against the soft cushions, their mouths almost touching.</p> <p>As they kissed, Cecilia whispered to her husband. Her husband began caressing Cecilia’s face and hair while they kissed, their hips rising and falling as they French-kissed. His hands ran down from Cecilia’s shoulders, down to her breasts, and her nipples became instantly erect. She began moaning as their tongues danced in their mouths. They were making passionate love to each other, and their tongues were all over each other, and everywhere they touched Cecilia was heaven.</p> <p>By now, Cecilia’s legs were becoming stiff, and a look of lust came over her face. When she turned her head to the side, her mouth hung open. They stared into each other’s eyes. She began grinding her hips against her husband, and she looked so beautiful, so sexy. Her mouth was open in passion, and her tongue was running along her upper lip.</p> <p>„Come in.”</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Albert walked to the ottomanicue, ”</p> <p></p> <p>with an, ac and,</p> <p>with, Cec</p> <p>ac and/ ” ” to c—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
