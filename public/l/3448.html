That would have to be a surprise. I would have to tell my Mom, that she would be disgusted by my ungratefulness, and my reckless behaviour. But the French would have it, because I wasn't wearing underwear.</p> <p>I'm ashamed to admit it to you: I was naked in front of the French boy. I felt shame. I felt ashamed. I feel ashamed.</p> <p>For a little while I lied there, in my own house, in my bed, watching the television. I had no idea what was on. But something seemed to be coming up. I felt like it was something important. And, at some point, I suddenly had an idea.</p> <p>I didn't have to go up. I knew what it was, exactly. It could never happen: my Mom would tell what I was doing, something horrible about me, and that's what would happen. But it seemed like something would happen. Something bad. I felt helpless. I couldn't control myself. And, I felt ashamed.</p> <p>But there was a reason. There was a reason: something very good will happen. I was beginning to become a man. Perhaps something could happen between us, and then that too could happen.</p> <p>And then I felt the need.</p> <p></p> <p>"A virgin... and a boy" The words were spoken in a voice low: "and a boy"</p> <p>I didn't understand at first, a little shocked. But I found that it could be so. I felt that what I was feeling, was also really good. And, I was very aroused. I could imagine I could smell my own sex in my son's room, right inside his jeans. Just the thought made me feel better and more aroused.</p> <p>The boy did have a penis, I imagined. And he was so much bigger than I thought, even longer.</p> <p>"It's only a small one."</p> <p>"And I'm only... three."</p> <p>"Oh, how very sad, "I said.</p> <p>"But... how was it, to be so... "</p> <p>His voice was like music: "I was so horny. I had never felt like this before. It was so good, "Oh, so great."</p> <p>My vagina felt so tingly. It was so warm and wet, too. It was a bit shameful, but it felt so good. It looked very beautiful. It felt sexy. It brought me to a place of sexual ecstasy.</p> <p></p> <p>I opened my son's fly and he felt my hand on the soft flesh of his penis. It felt so naughty, and so exciting. I was feeling so deliciously aroused.</p> <p>I pulled away from his lips and took his cock in my hand. It felt so alive. I put my lips on his cock and kissed it, like a lover, like some lollipop. I looked up at him and smiled. I kissed him there again, and this time, I put my lips around the tip of his penis, and my lips slid down the shaft. It felt so hot and soft and warm. I wanted to taste his dick more.</p> <p>With that I started moving my head up and down, taking his cock in and out of my mouth. I sucked it and let it touch my tongue. I moved my head back and forth: I sucked and licked and kissed it. It grew in my mouth, it made a soft wet sound.</p> <p>I could feel, if, if it got bigger, he would come in my mouth, and I did it myself, too. I pulled my mouth up off his cock. I couldn't believe it, how thrilling it made me feel and how erotic it made me feel. I put him back in my mouth. It felt so good to suck him that way.</p> <p>My mouth was tight. It was tight and tight, and his cock was such a good thickness. It made me feel so warm and wonderful. I felt his weight on me. It felt so exciting. I was so aroused. We were in my bed, and I sat on his lap and felt his wonderful softness and his hands on my breasts. He put his tongue in my mouth, and started giving me pleasure with his mouth. I moaned. I tasted so good. I kissed him passionately, and I pushed his head down and his mouth was open in mine.</p> <p>It was just so sexy. I did it again, and again, and then I moved his tongue along the underside and I took his penis in my mouth and slowly and I felt it, then moved it, I tried it again. I sucked it: I felt it, I tasted it I had a wonderful and my mouth's warm mouth. I felt it I wanted it it. It. I wanted all, and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
