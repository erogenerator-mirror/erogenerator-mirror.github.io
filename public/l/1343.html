The Meeting</h4><p><strong>After Mercédès had left Monte Cristo, he fell into profound gloom. Around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped; his energetic mind slumbered, as the</strong> plane rocked to and fro in his wake. He had always been a man with a libido but now, in the bright sunshine before him the feel of sex was as real as the dream of the moment, with his hands working through the material on the back of a book as it pressed out from under his fingers. And all the while his cock kept getting slicker and slicker until it almost made him ill with desire.</p> <p>The sound of the aircraft engines started, once again; the roar of the engines resonated throughout the aircraft as the propellers slowly lifted off the tarmac. Once again, he found his hands working into the back of the aircraft cabin, where he kneaded his own tits and, through the fabric of his top, he found the top button undone. He unbuttoned it and unclasped the rest of the buttons and the black bra straps, letting them fall to the floor of the plane like raindrops on the sky.</p> <p>By unbuttoning the rest of the buttons on the back of the white shirt he could slide his hand into the shoulder of his shirt and pull it out. He looked down at his own body; his own hands had worked into the chest of white shirt and he slid it under the straps of his bra. He lifted it above her shoulders and peeled it down to rest there on top of the other clothes. He then pulled the bra off of her chest, exposing her bare tits to the air, which of course was already wearing a thin bra. He slid his hands upward over the soft black flesh of her tits and gently tugged at the elastic covering her nipples. He could feel her chest rising and falling as she breathed. He sucked on her breast; he pulled at both of her nipples, which were already hard and he knew she could take them. He rolled his thumbs over them with more ease than she could and she shuddered as she felt the tips of them against her body. He cupped her tits again in his hands and rolled the nipples between his fingers.</p> <p>She was breathing heavy. She had never felt like this before; she was sure the sound of the plane on the runway would have filled the plane with its loud and incessant buzzing. She felt the nipples harden in her hands; then the flesh inside her breasts had become very hard and firm. If only he would suck her tits, she wondered, she could imagine them turning inside out, begging him to touch it with his tongue or mouth. But no, he would not suck and she felt the air against the hard tip of her breasts.</p> <p>And so she had been wondering, and she had fantasized about for a long time about a man's mouth sucking her tits. But he would not do it right or do what the airplane engine wanted, which is suck her tits, she thought. But she had been wondering what it would be like, what it looked like. And she had wanted to find out. And now she was, and she had a way she didn't know she wanted to know.</p> <p>She felt his mouth kiss up her neck and his mouth move away from the soft flesh and back down. She gasped as he brushed the tip of his tongue across the tip of her earlobe. She shivered as he slipped his tongue between her earlobe and the soft skin of her neck. His body rubbed against hers and she began to feel the wetness growing in her cunt. She felt it and her own breathing sped up as a growing lust built up in her belly. She pressed her hands into his hair as he kissed her neck once again...</p> <p>Mister Anderson,</p> <p>I would like to see you again and we can start to work our relationship and discuss how we might improve. Would you mind if we went out for coffee this time? She is so tired right now that she could easily fall asleep.</p> <p>As soon as we are in bed together and I can wake you, it will be just fine. But remember how we talked about it...</p> <p>Mr. Anderson,</p> <p>I am going to go through your suitcase and get your suitcase and we can move the two rooms inside. That is all. Just come out if you are on time and don't be late!</p> <p>Mrs. Anderson,</p> <p>After our conversation last night. I think we need to talk about what I have on your mind...</p> <p>I have been thinking about you all day and I think I will enjoy it more if you do join us... but I also feel that you need some time with an admirer. As I was saying, I have been thinking of this and I have come to realize that you are right.</p> <p>As I was saying, I have been thinking of you all day... and I have been thinking of things that I must... my life with you and now I have decided that I will find that I can enjoy life with you and that with you. And you. And I will be happy.
