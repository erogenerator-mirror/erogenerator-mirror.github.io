Night covered the streets.</strong></p> <p>He had no real desire to be in the first world war, but in his last year of teaching, he was becoming disillusioned with the world of the undead.</p> <p>The first two courses were his final exam. He was going to study the paranormal and its many facets. The first class in the supernatural community of the ancient church was an essay of an older vampire from a past church.</p> <p>After a while, he decided he would try some necromancy, if he lived long enough. In the first semester of his teaching class, he went over with the lecturer. He had met the professor for the last time after a very boring class. She was a short-haired mid-40's young woman of about twenty-five years old. She wasn't a vampire, but she was a very, very old church lady in his opinion.</p> <p>She stood only about an inch or so taller than him. She had a very beautiful, very pretty face and she had large, expressive green eyes.</p> <p>The professor introduced him to her. "Hendrick, you are a student of the Church of the Dead?"</p> <p>"Yes, Professor, thank you." He didn't get much information from her as she talked but he was sure she was interested. She was dressed in black and looked very much like the witch from his first class.</p> <p>Before the class started at 8 a.m., he had gone to the bathroom to pee and put on a white-colored shirt that had some sort of dark brown lining but he only could see a couple of dark brown buttons on one. He tried to follow her out of class for her, but before he got to the front of class, he was rudely interrupted by her again.</p> <p>"I think my class has just begun," she said.</p> <p>"Really? I thought you'd have finished with an early lecture."</p> <p>"Oh, thank God for that. We would have needed a couple of hours to finish. What I really want to know is whether you have a very good memory on your professor!"</p> <p>"Professor has really been a little lax, Hildy," he said, glancing over at her, "But I remember him calling me that several times a day. What do you think of Halloween? Are all the people dressed as Satanists, just for Halloween?"</p> <p>Professor Egan was a professor of psychology and one of the oldest in the class. She was well known as the head of the campus police force. She was in her late 40s and really had a great deal of charisma. She was very popular with the students; often going to parties or the theatre and dancing. Unfortunately, most of the students preferred to socialize with some of her lectures, especially Halloween partygoers. It was a very popular event in the school. Prof. Egan was very popular—at least among her students.</p> <p>"Well, Hildy, you know I don't know about the Halloween party itself, but the vampire thing. It's quite interesting." She smiled, "I know it was just for Halloween. I really feel like it was the real thing."</p> <p>"That is indeed very romantic."</p> <p>Hearing her say that, one of her students actually tried to get back in her professor's face, "The vampires are, hmmm. How do you feel about that?"</p> <p>"Professor, the vampire thing is definitely intriguing. I don't know about that, but I certainly do feel a stirring in my stomach."</p> <p>The professor had the class back to normal by the time the class was at half-past. They had done quite well for themselves in the first semester of their teaching class. The professor had really done well, especially compared to her class, because most students enjoyed their lectures. She seemed to excel herself.</p> <p>In her last class, she mentioned to the professor that she had seen and had asked the professor to give her something special.</p> <p>"How can we tell if it is for real if we are just looking for a quick fuck?"</p> <p>"Oh, do you really want that? I'm sure that you would love to do that to yourself, Hildy."</p> <p>She got very excited about the idea and then, almost as if on cue, the bell rang. "That will be all for later." she said, as she disappeared out of the classroom. Professor Egan looked at her with a puzzled expression on his face. She was the only one from the class who knew about the vampire thing. She was a very attractive young woman. She had nice curves but was definitely not a tall woman.</p> <p>Professor A. G. Hettmann returned back to the class. He had been given away her special instructions on the vampire ritual class. He was very impressed, he thought that a bit of course would have been something special.</p> <p></p> <p>"Professor Hilders," she said Hildy "You know the bell may—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
