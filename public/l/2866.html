What did I do? You can think how many orgasms this afternoon? I'm afraid I lost track of time. I'm sorry, John Mark, it's just that it was soooooo bad!"</p> <p>"Don't worry, my dear. We will find ways of getting around that, shall we?"</p> <p>"All in good time!"</p> <p>"Good-day, Father, Father," said John. "I know you're going to be late getting to work for some important moment. I hope you were successful today. Good-day, Father."</p> <p>"Oh good, I did, my dear. See you on Monday."</p> <p>"Now, now, no harm done." He kissed it good-bye and left the library.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>That Saturday in the park, near campus, the park was already dead quiet. The birds were singing when John leaned up against the fence and said, "God has a sweet voice," and turned around.</p> <p>"Oh, my," giggled Jane. "This will be our special Valentine's Day, you don't care yet, right? You can do whatever you want with me!"</p> <p>The others were asleep. "Let's go!" thought John, when he heard the car pull up in the parking garage. He turned to Jane, who was asleep, and hugged her tightly.</p> <p>"Do you feel any excitement?" he whispered in her ear, kissing it softly.</p> <p>"You are so evil! You think we have to be so wicked just to please God? Come on. Let's make love. I haven't been with a man, in years." She led him to the loveseat on his side of the loveseat and sat on his lap. John turned out his lights, and Jane kissed him hard.</p> <p>She put her arms around his neck and leaned her face into his shoulder while he ran his hands along her back, down her bottom, and slipped his fingers down between her cheeks, cupping her vagina and spreading her lips apart. She moved her hands up to his face and brought them down to his mouth. Both of them continued kissing gently while he felt her breasts against his chest.</p> <p>He moved the hem of her halter dress over her butt and slowly pulled it downward. He looked at her and smiled when he saw she wasn't wearing a bra. He lifted a breast to his mouth and sucked it hard and then lifted his head to take a nipple in his tongue. Her moans came from around his neck. He continued kissing her for just a moment, then lifted her to him and they embraced, her legs parting and John bent his knees and entered her easily.</p> <p>He began thrusting himself inside of her without thinking, as before the car came in, Jane moaned and began squirming, her eyes closed and mouth opened. John put his hand on her breast and took a nipple between his thumb and forefinger and felt it harden in his hand.</p> <p>At first it felt as if Jane were being stimulated to a level that had never occurred to anyone before. Not once she had made a sound, her head lay back on the sofa and her hips began lifting to meet his thrusts, the feeling becoming stronger with each thrust.</p> <p>Suddenly, she said, "I'm going to cum -- I'm going to cum!" and John knew that she was close. He knew how to push her over the edge, and suddenly thrust himself firmly inside of her again in one, long, forceful thrust. He felt her entire body convulse, and she clamped down with her eyes closed.</p> <p>John's own excitement increased. He reached around her and put his arms around her, holding her as he thrust into her harder and faster. Her hand came to him, and he touched it to his own nipple and saw that it was hard and erect -- almost too erect. She rubbed it softly in his hand and brought it to her own mouth and sucked on it, then took it back in her mouth.</p> <p>John's orgasm also got bigger. His body twitched and trembled and Jane could feel his semen seeping into her, then filling her vagina. She kissed him again, and moved her hips against him as he spurted himself into her. John's lips were full of love and his kiss soft and sweet, his tongue was hard with a passion that was unknown to him.</p> <p>They were still kissing when the car stopped. The others were not yet awake, and that was obvious. John put his hand over Jane's mouth, then slid the fingers and, and the finger into Jane's of his hand between her legs, into her vagina. He held her.
