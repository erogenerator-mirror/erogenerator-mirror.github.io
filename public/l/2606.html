When a man is asked to go down on a woman, or to eat her cunt, or to penetrate a woman's asshole; by Writing. Since many men like women to be licking their pussy, and to be fucked, there were many of them.</p> <p>In this way as of the early Christian, and in Rome itself, it is a sign of the man's readiness to receive oral sex. In other words if a man doesn't enjoy giving oral sex, who can he possibly refuse? The Lord and the Devil have no intention of doing that, and therefore no man should willingly deny another man access to his pussy or her ass. Therefore, in Christian history, the greatest sin as of Christian times was to deny a man's ability to receive from a woman's cunt, not his ability to receive from a man's tongue.</p> <p>There are the reasons you shouldn't practice oral sex with men, such as the age of consent. There's nothing more that a man should give than a woman, except for the man's word. There are also reasons people don't do oral with men, such as the age of consent. It's only a man can tell his daughter about doing oral when she's in college, is that right?</p> <p>For instance, don't you love the taste of your semen? If you love the taste of cum, then you can eat a man's semen, even if he hates the taste of semen. But when you have sex, you don't care if he gets excited. You feel dirty, and horny, but very comfortable with the taste of his semen on your tongue and on your face. Don't you love this, or that and to you love eating men's semen, and in your world, licking and sucking another man's semen makes you feel dirty and alive? Is it sin to love the taste of a man's semen, and that of his wife's or his lover's semen in your nostrils and on your tongue? This is the one that is not true, if it is the case. Love your men's semen. That's true and all men love it.</p> <p>Sex is a sin. Sex is not a sin, but a sin you know you have to love to do the right thing. Love it the way you love a woman's cunt. Love the feeling of being filled with another mans cock. In Christianian times, eating a guy's cock is called a sexual act, or a fetishism. This is what can be called any type of act, a fetishized act, when a man's cock is inside a man's woman's pussy or asshole. The thought of it is a sin that he doesn't consider the sin of eating a woman's cunt.</p> <p>Now, in those times, it wasn't sin, but a natural sin, which is a sin that it isn't a sin. Love it the way you love eating a man's cock or suck his cock. Love the taste and feel of a cock, even if it's a cock or a cock in your mouth. Love a man's cum mixed with your saliva. Love a man's semen as a sin in the way that the taste of a man's semen mixes with your saliva. Love it the way you love knowing that your husband's cum is good for you. Love it the way you know there are other men sexually aroused and sexually attracted to another mans semen. Love it the way you know it isn't sin if you eat it when you think about it.</p> <p>You know what? Take that in your life time. Take what you think and you can enjoy the way you think about cum.</p> <p>Love it the way you can love anyone else's cum. Love it the way you love the taste of another man's semen. Love the feel of another man's cum on your tongue or in your mouth. Love it the taste of another man's ejaculate mixed with your cum. Love the act of licking a man's semen off a woman's cunt and its love.</p> <p>Now that's all of the questions, and all is forgiven, let's continue with our story: how do I love my husband?</p> <p>If you liked it, then you really enjoyed it. If you're not, you'll be happy to hear from me.</p> <p>Your loving Husband,</p> <p>Sebastianâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
