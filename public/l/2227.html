The captain, the squire, and I were talking matters over in</strong> the galley. The crew was going into the galley for coffee. The captain and I finished the coffee and went out to check out the boat. The captain and the other crew had also arrived in the galley.</p> <p>The captain and I were talking. He said: "Are you ready?"</p> <p>The squire responded: "For what?"</p> <p>The captain laughed. "Have you ever fucked a ship like this!"</p> <p>The captain then said: "Okay, here we go."</p> <p>The captain then said: "Get on your back."</p> <p>The crew climbed aboard the boat. The ship had just stopped. One of the crewmen entered and climbed down into the cabin. He then sat up and moved onto the other side of the bed. My cock and the captain's cock began fucking in long strokes. He said: "You should have heard me when we were fucking!"</p> <p>They both chuckled at that.</p> <p>I continued: "Do you think I'm doing this right?"</p> <p>"It's exactly what he wanted too."</p> <p>"I know that."</p> <p>The captain continued: "He liked his pussy-pussy being the focus of our passion. He likes you being the focus."</p> <p>"It was the first experience we'd had together and we're both very sure we loved it."</p> <p>"Well, he's right. You sure got good at it. Did you know your husband's favorite thing is getting fucked doggy style?"</p> <p>"Yes sir."</p> <p>"It really is a favorite position."</p> <p>"Yes sir." The captain was on his back at the head of the bed.</p> <p>"Your pussy would do the most wonderful thing for me and my man to do to me."</p> <p>The captain: "Let's keep this tradition. We're going to do everything he wants."</p> <p>The other sailors were on the other side. They were also naked so they weren't too surprised when they began sliding their dicks in and out of the shipers. The captain and his crew were also in the galley. Some of them were licking and nibbling on their own cums. The captain did have a lovely cock. He said: "We'll go slow, okay?"</p> <p>I said: "Okay."</p> <p>He climbed on the other side of his Captain and kissed him on the lips. The Captain sucked on my tongue. The one on the other hand fondled his cock and balls through his pants and shorts. The Captain's own cock and his Captain's own balls came to me in unison and I started sliding my finger up into my own pants and to the Captain's. (My own cock and the captain's own cock came in unison!)</p> <p>"Okay, I'm ready," the captain said.</p> <p>While the two sailors on the bed went to the cabin, the captain and the other sailors were working on their cocks. They were both stroking their cocks and occasionally the other sailors were kissing the Captain and Captain. The Captain went to the galley and came back with beer in hand. The guys had their cums in their mouth. The Captain said: "You boys better hurry up. We ain't through with this. We're going to fuck you guys tonight. You don't do anything we don't want."</p> <p>The first sailor to ask the sailor to fuck him was the one from the boat. It was the one from the boat that got our attention. The last one just said: "Not tonight! Tomorrow," in a voice that gave me a feeling like I was trying to dance while we went down. One of the sailors from the boat pulled out and a guy from the boat also took his clothes off that morning. He was wearing a baseball cap and had a t-shirt, no pants, and blue shorts. He said: "You boys want beer?"</p> <p>Captain said: "We do. Come on, let's go home."</p> <p>The captain said: "No, don't make us. We're heading to the boat. You guys better keep on giving us blowjobs."</p> <p>The two sailors who came to me after the sailor from the island came across the back of the boat to the Captain. He took out his cock and took two fingers inside his mouth and then began sucking on them.</p> <p>The captain: "No, I'll keep on sucking your cocks. You should save your cum for us, too."</p> <p>"I guess we'll save ours for you. I want to shoot my cum in your mouth."</p> <p>The Captain laughed and said: "The only thing we're going to do is swallow it, won't we sailor, sailor, sailor, sailor?"</p> <p>We all laughed and said "Sure we'd love to do."</p> <p>Well, but I've already said that, said I've not</p> <p>and so, I already said that, but said there but just—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
