Her hair was ruffled on her forehead and her cheeks were bright pink. Her</strong> pussy was moist and very wet. In the midst of it that she had already taken five fingers so the act alone did not seem as bad.</p> <p>The act itself is just another expression for orgasm. The phrase of orgasm is something that even a healthy young girl would never understand. But what made it all so good at the time, was the way that Mary began to move her head from side to side. She had a sort of hypnotic, seductive sway to it. She put her hands behind her head and slowly drew her hips forward to meet a finger, not even touching her clit. Mary was in ecstasy. Her body was shaking. I was not moving at all.</p> <p>The girl in front of me, had to be the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. Her dark red hair hung down her back and I could feel every crevice of her body. Her skin was so smooth and soft. She had lovely, round breasts and her nipples were so erect that they were aching to be touched. Her legs were spread almost as far as I could tell and her hairless pussy was glistening.</p> <p>The fact that she had just masturbated was one thing but doing the actual act in front of a stranger, was something else.</p> <p>The whole thing was kind of strange so I just stared, mesmerized. She was so vulnerable but so excited that she wouldn't even have been able to stop herself. The whole thing started to build in my mind to the point where I thought my cock was going to explode in my jeans. I couldn't get away. She kept doing this motion.</p> <p>After a few more thrusts, Mary felt herself get as close to the edge as before. The girl behind her pulled her whole body up and backwards. All those years of watching people do what they did, were all gone. It still felt so fucking great. I didn't think there had been anything like that in my life. It was like an epiphany. She was so much more erotic than in her masturbating.</p> <p>The movement on the bed caught me totally off guard. Then, all the way up, there was an explosion.</p> <p>Mary was going off. It wasn't just the fucking! I don't remember a thing. We kissed as she rode out her orgasm on me. Then she moved onto me, kissing me all over, all over, all over my face.</p> <p>I couldn't stop myself from licking her tits and sucking on her nipples, which, surprisingly, were not her breasts. I licked one of her sweet little nipples while she moaned and shivered in front of me. She had this whole world to herself that was in front of me.</p> <p>The last thing that I heard was her saying, "Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me." She was so turned on that I felt like I wanted to eat her whole body whole.</p> <p>That's how it started. The next thing that my friends heard was that the whole college was in tears. I think that was exactly what they were saying when I got home. It broke Mary's heart. The last little kiss that she had ever had was just a token touch.</p> <p>They were crying because I had fucked their brains out!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>END—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
