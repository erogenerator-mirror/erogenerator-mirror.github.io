(Yes, my dear reader that is my own question!)</p> <p>My cock, still hard in Faith and my hands, slips past Faith and into the moist heat and wetness just above. Faith is on her back, her legs in the stirrups, thighs open. I am kneeling over her knees, my cock rubbing up and down between her lovely legs.</p> <p>Faith was still wearing her dress, but we had removed it. I reached down and slid my pants off. Faith's skirt was bunched up around the waist. I slid my cock out of my pants, moved up to her pussy, and placed the head between those pretty, moist lips. They were so wet.</p> <p>I pressed in to Faith's vagina and felt how tight as Faith was. I held my cock there, letting the head sink against the wetness inside. Faith was groaning. I kept on pressing into her, and was soon rewarded by a long sigh of relaxation, a shuddering of her spine, a moan of pleasure and deep breaths.</p> <p>I was fucking Faith, taking in the beauty of her, taking in the scent of her skin; feeling her hot body, caressing her breasts. Her legs were spread wide, her pussy opening up to me. In between moans and cries, Faith began to wail.</p> <p>"Harder!" she cried.</p> <p>"Yes!" I responded. Faith screamed louder.</p> <p>I pushed into her. Faith groaned as I rammed into her again and again. Faith's hands were on my hips, trying to push me deeper inside her. I could feel our wet bodies slapping against one another, our wet pubic hair matted down together, and the sweat and lubrication from our exertions, from excitement of the evening in a new, more civilized world!</p> <p>Faith's breath and groans became more frequent. I pulled her legs around my hips, reached to her breasts, found her nipples, and gave them a pinch. Faith began to grunt!</p> <p>"You are so big! Go on, fuck me...fuck me! Give it to me!"</p> <p>I let her legs go loose then pulled them up and back. Faith was spread like a wanton whore. I was fucking her, making her body mine. Her hands were around my neck, pulling me into her. My hands came down to her breasts, massaging them gently.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, do me, do me! Do me! Fuck me, put it in!"</p> <p>I started to thrust into Faith faster now, thrusting hard, grinding my pelvis against her pussy.</p> <p>"Yes! Yes! Fuck me! I'm going to cum! Go on! Oh, yes!"</p> <p>I felt myself starting to shoot. Faith took my penis in her hand, squeezed, and began to rub all the warm, sticky cum into her pubic hair. My own cum began to pour out of Faith's vulva and onto me. Faith's hands were on my ass, gripping me tightly, pulling me into her.</p> <p>With a final groan,Faith's body went into convulsions. Her head thrashed from side to side on the stirrups. She looked like a woman possessed.</p> <p>I felt her climaxes starting to subside. Faith's hands left my ass and she leaned on the side of the bed. I could feel my own juices starting to flow out of Faith.</p> <p>"You really are a slut," I said as I withdrew. Faith grinned at me.</p> <p>"I'm just saying. I've always been such a slut," she replied. I sat on the bed.</p> <p>Faith was still on her side, on the bed in her own wet clothes. She was looking at the floor. "I want you to fuck me in your sleep. I want you to fuck me in your fucking sleep. Please, please come inside me, I want you."</p> <p>"Well... I could come with you."</p> <p>Faith giggled. "Oh yes, you could come. Oh!"</p> <p>"Oh! There's a little problem."</p> <p>"What? What's the problem? I don't think you remember."</p> <p>"The problem is I don't feel really comfortable."</p> <p>"Oh. Well, I'll go on and on with you."</p> <p>"I'm still tired."</p> <p>"Well, come on, let's go."</p> <p>Faith lay there. Her head turned toward the door.</p> <p>"I don't actually want to get into bed with you. You'll see. I still don't have my clothes on."</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"Well, I can make the two," Faith whispered. My own thoughts are a bit, aren't you," I want to. "I want to come.</p> <p></p> <p>" to.
