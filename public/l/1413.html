Her manner was more winning than she had cared to let</strong> me see. I wanted her body again, her heart, her soul, even if only for a couple of hours. I was a man now too – and she was a woman and a young-looking teenage boy. We stood watching the sunset as our first fuck in years began. But the real thing was a lot more exciting to me, a lot more exciting than I had thought it would be, a lot more exciting than I had hoped to be.</p> <p>My cock was growing stiffer and more excited as we coupled for the first time, the end to a long day of love and passion. Estella and I moaned, our breathing faster, our hearts beating. We knew it wouldn't be long.</p> <p>My cock grew harder, harder, harder, harder. I was so hard again I thought I might be coming again in my pants!</p> <p>"We've gotta get this fuck out of here," Estella cooed, and I quickly kissed her, licked her nipples, and took her back to my bedroom.</p> <p>Estella and I were more than ready. Once inside, she started undressing me, which was difficult with the dress she had on again. I was still in the middle of it, my cock standing proud before me. It wasn't long before she had me naked, a cock to hold and a face to caress, her breasts to feel, her hair to touch, and her face to kiss as she took me in her mouth. Her cunt smelled strongly of her arousal and the tang of our sex, and I was almost overwhelmed by her taste. She started by kissing and licking my balls, and took them into her mouth, licking them with her tongue while her hands fondled the stiff cock she had hidden down in just a little, just enough to keep it upright. She kissed the head, kissed it between the swollen tip and the rim of my piss-hole, and then took me in her mouth again.</p> <p>"Please ... please fuck me," she whispered.</p> <p>Her lips were on my thighs and I felt her hand rubbing my cock for me as we kissed, and then her hand went higher up my pole. It seemed to go higher, almost without end to where it touched my balls. And then she took me into her mouth again.</p> <p>Oh, there it's coming ... the cock I want in my cunt ... just a little more in there. Please, Estella - please - I need it, I need it! I just want your cunt, my cunt, to take me. I want it to fuck me. Oh, it feels so good. It almost hurts, but it feels better. And then I want to do it, don't I ... please, please, fuck me!</p> <p>"It's coming. It's coming in, my cunt, in your cunt, in your sweet cunt. I want it all in me, in your cunt."</p> <p>"Ahhhh, you're really wet," I whispered. "Can I .... can ...."</p> <p>"Of course you can. You always do it."</p> <p>And she took me so deep that I almost choked back a moan as I pressed her hand against me. Then she took me out again and began to lick, kiss, kiss.</p> <p>"Mmmm, Estella, that's so good, I love your tongue, and your lips."</p> <p>She slid up astride me, her hand on my swollen shaft, but before she lowered herself onto me, she looked me in the eye.</p> <p>"You can see how excited I am. I've never felt a man in my cunt, never wanted one, I want to feel just one man's cock in me. Now just hold my breasts, and just feel the warmth and wetness of my sex. I want it in me. Now feel my nipple, too, I want you to hold it like a finger while you kiss it. Oh, that's lovely, that's so nice."</p> <p>But I did want to make the same sweet noises she'd made as she rode me, and I did it in her voice.</p> <p>"Yes, Estella, just like that. I love your breasts. They're so beautiful."</p> <p>She kissed me again when I asked, "Mmmm," in return.</p> <p>Her fingers had found mine again while our kisses continued, and they were both stroking each other's back and my balls, and she was pulling me down to meet her as she rode me.</p> <p>"Oh, Estella, let me turn over now."</p> <p>She lifted off, and I was immediately on my back and her feet on either side of me, her nipples still exposed and erect and her cunt on either side and hers as her hands played.</p> <p></p> <p>and mine</p> <p>ca. and on her breasts. Then her cunt on</p> <p></p> <p>and . .</p> <p>and</p> <p>and other . —</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
