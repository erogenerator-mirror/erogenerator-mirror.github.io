Love is the salutation of the angels to</strong> the heavens above that, without which Love, with which, you would be a liar. Love is all that exists in the universe that you would think that you could make into a true world, one that could stand on its toes, be proud of, and live happily ever after.</p> <p>"I guess I have a question about something, sir," said Angel.</p> <p>"Oh? You mean about the sun?"</p> <p>"Ah, yes. It's the sun. The sun. I think I know what you are referring to," said Angel.</p> <p>"I'm asking you a question," I said, smiling.</p> <p>"Well, that is so sweet."</p> <p>"Well, yeah," I said. "Let's go over to the sun, shall we?" I said.</p> <p>We climbed down into the sun and made our way to the sun and began our ascent down to the base of the mountain, where the sun had grown two hundred thousand feet above the base of the mountain. There was a tiny glimmer of the sun in between the valley we entered. We arrived at the summit where the sun set into a white sphere. The sun rose higher on the glimmering glimmer, rising higher in the direction of the horizon. At our level of altitude, the sun set down into the centre of the sun. Upon it, the day began, not a star, but the sun, the celestial sphere, or the sun, the sun that had just risen in the sky and began to slowly rise, rising higher and higher until the sun, which had become a white object for us both in the middle of a small, cloudy field of snow, rose up from the centre of the glimmering sphere and rose high and proud at our highest altitude.</p> <p>"I love you!" said Angel.</p> <p>Angel took hold of my hand and held it with hers. After the joyous day, as I would have said that it was, the days had turned to long-ago, even in the middle of the day, into years of never ending happiness. We had always been close. We had always been friends. We had always had children, grandchildren, inseminations. So we had been close. That day, just before the end of our lives, I was in Angel's arms, holding her tightly, and I looked into her eyes as she looked away for tears of shame. There was also a smile there for her tears of joy, also.</p> <p>"Thank you, my love," I said to her. I kissed her on her lips, then, I kissed her on her cheek, her neck, her breasts, her nipples, her navel, and finally her vagina and vagina only an inch shy of her vaginal lips. I kissed and nibbled her, then, I kissed and tongued her vagina until she was wet enough to permit my saliva to glide down the sides of her lower lips, until my saliva lubricated her vaginal canal, then, I looked at Heaven, Heaven and Heaven and Heaven, until we were as far away from Heaven as was possible.</p> <p>I climbed down from the summit of the sun and placed my arms around Angel's neck, my mouth pressed against her right breast, my lips against her left breast. I sucked her breast, and she pulled me to her. My mouth on her breasts, my mouth and tongue on her. The sun of the mountain rose up at my right breast and rose up the left one. My tongue and my hands in her vagina, my mouth and tongue on her. The sun rose up at my left breast and rose up the left one. The sun rose up at my fingers in Angel's anus, while my fingers inside of her vagina, while my tongue was in her vagina and the tongue in her anus, while my fingers in her vagina, while my tongue in her anus, while my lips were in her vagina and my tongue in her anus. The sun rose to her right breast and rose to her face. The sun rose to her feet and rose to her shoulders and rose to her toes. The sun rose down and out and down till all the sun's light was upon her upper body. The sun rose higher while I ate her. I sucked her breasts, and she rubbed my head, and I sucked her vagina. We were both in ecstasy, we were both alive under the sun. We are both alive in the sun—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
