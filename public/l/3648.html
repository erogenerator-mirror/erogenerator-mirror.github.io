We prepared immediately to sail, but did not weigh that night. The next morning</strong> it was we, with the sky blue skies. And it was good. We had some real time!</p> <p>I had been a real trooper in handling the sails, and sailing the plane on all we crew, in our private and private time I felt like I belonged. But once we were in the ship I had an urge to take out a few pounds by having sex with both my shipmates, and I wanted very much to do so.</p> <p>But at the same time I was afraid and excited about doing it again, and to continue fucking both my shipmates, but also as my mind wandered to sex. I knew that all of this must happen again very soon. My wife had an eventful pregnancy due in a few months, and her pregnancy could be delayed a little longer.</p> <p>I had just finished a few days of sailing, and was looking again as soon as possible to have sex with both my shipmates, and then get to the bed, and have sex with both my shipmates again. They had some very exciting times together, and their sexy and exotic ways was very intoxicating. But first things first, and I started to prepare myself: there was no reason to hide our sex with each other from them again. We had already done it many times before, and were both extremely horny and wanted to give this experience as well as possible.</p> <p>A large window was open, and I took out my wallet that had been with me earlier, which I had borrowed before I left the ship, and placed in between my shirt pocket for this occasion. With one free hand, I started to open the buttons of my shirt, but I then thought to go ahead. It was too hot, too risky for me to go back out to the ocean. I was determined to try and find someone to do as they had tried so many times before, and let them try and find this new sex with me. So I took my shirt off. For the next few minutes I opened and closed my shirt in such a way that there was a gap in the fabric between my shirt front and the shirt and my sleeves, allowing all the buttons to open and close, and revealing only my chest and my collarbones and a few inches of my chest. I could see most of my face, and the sides of a few of my lips. I looked down at my hands, and thought how well they were doing the same. "My hands!" The words sounded like gibberish "Do they do that?" "These are very strange!"</p> <p>But my shirt was open, and I was looking downward at the cleavage that had my shirts half open. My shirt then suddenly had a gap, and as it slid down, I had a perfect view of my upper chest of my entire chest, including my arms, lower and lower, which were completely naked, and exposed for the night, of my collarbones and my nipples.</p> <p>"Oh, my!" I thought "I could do that in a minute." But before I could think of an answer, my shirt had just slid completely off, and I still couldn't bring my hands to my upper body in fear of covering my nipples, my breasts, my bare skin. I was feeling quite embarrassed about this, but I didn't want to think much about it too much. I took my hands to feel my chest, which was very smooth and soft, while my eyes were quite closed. They then went to my nipples, which were already erect, since I first looked downward and touched the side of them, and they are really cute. When I touched my nipples I felt them tingle, I could feel myself becoming more and more excited, but I couldn't stop myself.</p> <p>I then took my hands away, and again put them back down on my shirt. At the same time for a second, both my hands returned to their normal places at my nipples, but this time I brought them together in a way that meant only that I was doing it, and my other hand came to rest on one of my breasts for the first time. Even that first touch was more and more exciting, and it got me excited again. I brought my right hand around to my nipples again, but this time I made sure with my head that I also touched one of my nipples and my left tit with my own hand. At the same time my hands, and their hands, came to a near stop, so that I could take some time to admire my body in it: I could even feel the top of my legs, a part of my upper body, not only the part of the shirt.</p> <p>I was starting to have a sexual dream, and was feeling like it was real. But I couldn't stop a moment: I wanted them to end immediately, but wanted to try again. And again and to see what they both of my breasts for a second time, I thought as I started to make love them together again and to touch my right and let it, and not too—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
