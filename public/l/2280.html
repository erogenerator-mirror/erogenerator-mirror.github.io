The first time they had sex, he'd done his best not to kill them and had fallen asleep in the arms of the beautiful Cathy but she'd woken, kissed him and was still in her panties, while riding him. The more her vagina rubbed against his manhood, the more she'd wanted him and felt him pressing against her cervix and she had come again. Now she was going at him with an enthusiasm she'd never expected and had hoped for but her new lover looked so good and she'd loved him, wanted him as much as she'd loved him.</p> <p>But she'd done nothing. His seed hadn't done any good at all for the first three of weeks after her lover had died. Their first sexual encounter and it had been a pleasure to have the feeling of a warm cock deep inside her but they'd never got more than they'd had at that, even now.</p> <p>Cathy smiled at herself. She'd been surprised by the memory of the man who'd died. It had been the realisation that she'd been a lover, that he'd had a love, that something special really needed in the world of women but they were still young. And they'd had a lot of fun. They'd had sex, really wild sex. He'd been a great lover and she'd loved him, despite her fear about what she'd made him do with her other fingers. But had he not been dead? Or was it her fault he'd been out there after all? It felt like her whole world had been made up of the two.</p> <p>In her mind they'd always fucked and it hadn't ever been her fault, not ever! And, now, he was almost gone and she was starting to feel like she deserved all the benefits of a good fuck. She'd come from a bad marriage, but it hadn't been her fault.</p> <p>Was she a bad fuck? Oh God, yes!</p> <p>Cathy stood, took her jeans and panties off, then made a coffee and ate a bit of her meal in the kitchen. He had given nothing to get her off her own bed and she wondered would he still want her.</p> <p>He had not really.</p> <p>They spent an hour together in the lounge and after coffee Cathy went and put down the bag of condoms and dropped her jeans then stepped into her panties, still wet and still warm and he'd lain at his side and lifted her a little so that she ended up lying on her back and kissing her, first on one side then on the other. Then he'd slipped his hand round her back.</p> <p>Cathy was in heaven.</p> <p>This hadn't been the first lover. No other lover had touched her like that. Only one had kissed her so lovingly and felt the desire of her vagina and made her feel happy. The other had taken her hand and held it as they made love and felt her respond positively.</p> <p>Cathy had felt good.</p> <p>Then there was someone else. It felt wrong.</p> <p>Was she too young? Or too old?</p> <p>Was it just a one-off?</p> <p>Could it be someone else's?</p> <p>It was too soon.</p> <p>She looked around, then up at him. He had a big smile, a happy face, but his hands were on her breasts. And there was a bit of heat in his face. She reached behind herself and felt the smoothness of his hand as it slid along her inner thigh over to the wet patch in her crotch then up it, under the lace and up her stomach, to find the hood on her clitoris and her wet slit was already open and her clit throbbed there. He put a finger in her vagina</p> <p>Cathy felt something wet and hot.</p> <p>What?</p> <p>His whole hand felt like a finger or a cock but his other hand rubbed her breast.</p> <p>Ohhhh…</p> <p>He held her hand and she felt some sort of heat in his other hand as she felt one of his fingers probe at her vagina and his thumb pressed into her, slowly, carefully, not pushing in, pushing in against the surface of her skin, against something that was just a little moist but which her brother's mouth had found and she'd come to love that moment.</p> <p>He said something in Cathy's head, something about feeling his own hand at her breasts.</p> <p>Cathy was feeling something in him. What? Where?</p> <p>Did he know? Of course he knew and so did her cousin. Who was he?</p> <p>He lay there then, smiling, his arm around her back, his other leg under hers, his finger pressing softly to her opening she was wet hole and he was opening her in her vagina. His arm. a little finger was in her vagina which was on her vagina! he could touch she was there to where? , where.
