THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS</h4><p><strong>When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between the years ’82 and ’90, I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting</strong> facts about me: I am an alcoholic, I am a wuss and I am one of the sexiest men in the world but my sexcapades never really fit.</p> <p>I love to have sex: lots of it, from just about anything it seems, including my fingers. The fact that it can be done with a dildo only makes me hornier. I just haven’t mastered that skill yet.</p> <p>I never realized until a month ago how much I love sex. I love being on top! I love making others cum while I do it. I love it when I suck their hard dicks while I pump that beautiful cock with my pussy so it can't be forgotten until I meet another horny man in another world, preferably as hot as I am now. My favourite part of sex is when I am riding a real cock (I always say it’s only for the women with dicks, that’s just my preference).</p> <p>Sex has always been good for me but it’s never great for a relationship. A relationship just isn’t good for me anymore, just because I know you’re going to be thinking thoughts like that about me. To make a long story short, a woman doesn’t need to worry about getting a man to go out if she’s already satisfied. It just takes a pretty woman to be satisfied.</p> <p>“Why do I think I have such a big cock?” The word ‘cock’ came out of my mouth without thinking about it. The only reason that my dick is able to satisfy you really well is that you are the one getting it. I don’t know why, but if you give me this information it’s kind of easy!</p> <p>“It’s big, it’s beautiful, it’s hard to resist, it’s hot and it’s yours!”</p> <p>“I think I understand, but then I’d need you to know that I really like to have a cock inside of me, that I’m a girl and we want that big thing inside of us whenever and wherever we find it.” The statement came out almost involuntarily.</p> <p>“I do understand and I love you. Do you know what else?” Oh my, what else will you let me know?</p> <p>“I do.” The words came out right out of my mouth but only in my heads.</p> <p>“I see,” I said with a smile that made her feel good. Now she could tell that I thought I knew that. I was just a little curious, didn’t want to appear like an overbearing old fart and just wanted to hear it again.</p> <p>We got into bed one night and did it. I started stroking my cock so she can feel it if she can, as long as we have the chance. She started off gently caressing me and slowly stroking me.</p> <p>“It looks very big. Does it hurt?”</p> <p>“No, it just feels a little uncomfortable. I can still feel it in my hand but I won’t need to really touch it.” I started fondling my cock now. She was still massaging it and it became more and more difficult to go the back.</p> <p>“Do you want me to suck it?” she whispered in my ear.</p> <p>At that moment I just wanted to make her a woman and I wanted her to know that all the good things about me really matter to this world of lust and sex. I wanted her to know that I know this world that women are not born to feel lust.</p> <p>“That would be nice,” I whispered, and with that, I turned on my side so she could take the back of my neck. Her lips were gentle as always and she didn’t really need any pressure. The fact that she’s a woman shouldn’t make her seem reluctant but the fact that she knows how to give a woman another hard cock just made it that much more intense for me.</p> <p>I felt her lips touching me and her tongue moving over it. I couldn’t resist the urge and started stroking the shaft between her lips. It felt fantastic and I felt her tongue lapping my head. I was in a new world of lust and sex and that’s when I really got into it. She must have felt it too, because when I thought she was all right with me, she was just so lovely with her head propped up on my hand.</p> <p>’s. She didn’t miss anything when I had anything of hers on when we were fucking, it, that night. together.
