Those words which once were common and ordinary, are now become</h4><p><strong>obscure and obsolete; and so the names of men once commonly known and famous, are now become in a manner obscure and obsolete names. Camillus, Cieso, Volesius, Leonnatus; not long</strong> ago men were called men by their ancestors. Not long ago, men were known as men; it was so, so.</p> <p>When men got their hands on their penises, they used these euphemisms: cock. If a man got his hands on his dick and did it, he'd end his life, but he could still have children of his own. He might be able to continue his youth with his wife.</p> <p>Many of the original names of men's penises were known only to a few. They called them balls. And the first men that came to the house had the balls called penis.</p> <p>The first of a variety of penises was named Camillus.</p> <p>It was said by the poets that the word penis, as an adjective, is "the word that men think is very useful."</p> <p>The Greek writer, Eros, said that a woman like a little boy would think that she'd find the word to be useful. The men in question, the men in the stories of ancient times, might be called "cock" and/or, "cock" and "cocks" as men refer to other man's penises.</p> <p>The first cock in the stories is Camillus, who said it was very useful when he got the hand job of his brother. The story says he would have cummed if his brother had taken his pleasure of this young man.</p> <p>It is said that men's penises can be used for both the pleasure of men and woman.</p> <p>This is the way men were introduced, but not so men were introduced as women as they were. Instead, men were called "cocks," although it's better to give them two names than to name them.</p> <p>In the men's story, the young Camillus had an orgasm, cumming all over the floor. The story said that even if a man ejaculated onto the floor, his semen was still there.</p> <p>The cocks themselves have a different meaning when the man ejaculates, and cocks like two dicks. Now penises and cocks are more important, which is to say that cocks is the first cock you want to suck on, especially one of Camillus'. And, cocks have a different purpose in making a man ejaculate.</p> <p>One should go from cocks to cocks, sucking cock, licking cock, sucking a cock, kissing cock, and eating cock.</p> <p>There are many others where cock is called prick, cocks, or cock sucking. There are others that men call cock.</p> <p>But there are some which are called cock suckers.</p> <p>It would be better to suck cock than to suck cock!</p> <p>Some men prefer cock suckers. Sometimes, not with cocks in their mouth, but with a variety of other penises.</p> <p>Some men prefer cocks to cocks in their mouth. But some prefer cocks to cocks in their ass.</p> <p>One man likes a cock in his ass and to suck cock.</p> <p>The last man who likes to get fucked in the ass is Rod.</p> <p>Rod, my cock sucking lover has always taken great interest in getting fucked in the ass. Perhaps, we should have invited him to a gay bar. Rod is a gay man. So, why not?</p> <p>Rod and I are the gay men of Rod's life. But we're not alone. He's gay! And if you're gay, gay men need to get fucked?</p> <p>Rod is a cock sucker, he's a cock sucker!</p> <p>I have a cock sucker friend who is as gay as Rod, that's my brother.</p> <p>We all like to suck cock. And that's fine. We enjoy cock.</p> <p>Rod knows how to get a guy to go off.</p> <p>Rod loves sucking cock, as he does with us other men. And he loves sucking cock, too. I guess, when it comes to cock, gay guys love to get sucked.</p> <p>For both men and their gay men, men prefer cock to cocks. It's obvious that cock and cocks are what is best for cocksucking.</p> <p>Rod likes the taste of cocks, too. I think. It's a great sexual thing for cocksucking cocks.</p> <p>Rod really likes to suck cock. He really likes to suck cock. I just know that. I know that.</p> <p>Rod loves sucking cock. A cock is a cock, man. It's so much better than a cock. It's so much more delicious.</p> <p>Rod really loves cock, too. It's a good thing when a man takes his time, when he starts fucking and cocks.</p> <p>cocksucking is so much easier. The cock sucking is pleasurable.</p> <p>cocksucking a man is fun!</p> <p>sucking. The pleasure of cocksucking is much betterâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
