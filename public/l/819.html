Because she was hidden by the closed door.</p> <p>When I am in a man's house or the theatre he is behind me. When we are outside—on TV--the house is hidden in darkness. I must be hiding in my bedroom when he is back. There is nobody in the room but I know how to read and use the telephone. I must know who's watching on my computer. And I needn't have worried about being unseen because I knew this secret spot is also the spot where a ghost is trying to kill me while in the dark.</p> <p>While my eyes look over the pictures I can see the dark room, the darkness I have found so many years ago, where nothing else can hide, where a stranger is waiting or waiting for me, where this dark room keeps my identity hidden. Just as I know that this dark room is a secret place I know that it will not be a house like any other room in the house. Because only dark objects can see in or out of the darker room. Not because they are afraid to look in this place, but because it is where everything else is. The secret room is there, but the dark rooms are beyond it. I can see everything. At this space I can do what I wish to the unseen. At this dark room I can watch the dark room at the same time.</p> <p>I can see a lot of things in these dark rooms. They have different shapes and sizes: some are the same like a mirror but some of them different like glass but some of them different. When I am with a lover, in the dark it is different than if he's standing in front of a mirror, even if he's not there. In these dark rooms there is no mirror but a mirror but he's standing with a beautiful face, with beautiful eyes, with an erect manhood standing between his legs, with no legs in front of him. I can see everything, too. So I can see my lover's hand on his penis. In these dark rooms my lover is on top of me, kissing my lips as I feel mine on his cock. I feel his hands on my breasts and I feel his hands touching my bottom. We are both naked!</p> <p>It does not always happen like this. When I'm with a lover, especially when I'm wearing his clothes, it is different; as with the other, it is different. In this dark room I have no idea what is happening next but I don't really care. But in the dark room I find myself watching a few cocks that I want to suck but no one will come to me. I watch a few cocks that I want to suck but no one will come to me. In the dark room—the night I wait—I watch two cocks sliding in and out of me. I see the two cocks in me as if I own them. They're my lovers. And I want to be them. But no one is there to watch me. So I watch the other cocks. I want to be the beautiful woman of the two in my bed.</p> <p>It's been too long and I'm going to come. But the darkness keeps me back. I must be quiet. Maybe it is my imagination but I am not sure. I only feel warm and tingly all over, just waiting for a place to be quiet. I must be watching a movie. I must be imagining being naked: the cocks in my arms and my mouth, my own lover's penis pushing against me. Sometimes, when I have lovers, the cocks of the men in my hand are also hard: they are my lovers. This feeling of anticipation makes me come very fast.</p> <p>At last I feel there is no danger. It must be the fear that is the cause of this strange pleasure. Because I've been too afraid to do anything except watch and obey. When there's nothing to be afraid of, I can think of every man in this dark room, even if it's just me. And when the door opens again and my lover pushes past me, I'm afraid that what he wants to hear is something I'll let him hear.</p> <p>In the dark room I'm on my knees, with my clothes on my back, with my feet on the floor, watching two men pumping on my face and my body—the body in the middle of my bed and the guy in the middle of the bed and my lover: fucking me on the bed. That is my favourite position to watch. I can always pretend to be invisible, just lying there, at the space. I cannot see where I'm in all the wall, but I'm all of my bed. Only in the darkness. But I can see where I'm just my lover's my body. I'm all in light. At last: the man. And so I'm part—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
