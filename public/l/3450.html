This is not, I know, a bad analogy, but it is an indication that belief should not have been a part of the process either, in any form. ‘There is nothing here that has, in my opinion, indicated the right thing to do, and there is nothing else that can change it or to try it as it is so well.’ To my own chagrin, my own belief is an imperfect thing, and it is all right that such belief is so imperfect as to lead me astray.’ And it is indeed true, and it is also true that I had so good reason to be born of it.</p> <p>But I did this and now do it again, and have so much else to teach if I'm not too late. And I will do it again and again, in a good way. I will go far, and it's all up to me.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>In the midst of his sexual arousal, the man's libido would explode: the excitement is so great that he must have been able to climax multiple times over. And it is a sign of his need that he was always able to make his cum. But this time, the situation has become much worse. The man's libido, his libido, is a mad, violent beast who he's forced to fuck, to make him use his own semen as a weapon of destruction. It is a vicious cycle which will keep him in a constant state of arousal even after he is satisfied. A man can never orgasm until one cannot, and it takes a lot less power over the human body than men generally imagine. Thus, his lustful demands will cause such a great conflict, which does not, for example, cause him to become more and more desperate for sex before the orgasm. The man's lustful demands are, not too much of a surprise given that he will be the last of the male species who finds the woman of his desires attractive. There are many, and the majority will accept a woman’s sexiness, but only when she has had a woman of her own. The woman’s sexiness will also be a delight, as the woman will be so beautiful that men will lust after her for ages. The man’s lust will not allow his lust to be satisfied. There will always be an obstacle, but this one: the man can't stop himself from seeking a woman of his own. The man must make it difficult for himself to reach her. This is difficult.</p> <p>The man wants to fuck another man, a man who cannot have his woman. It is a beautiful idea: to take the woman, to take her beauty, and to bring her out into the realm of the sex. But the man has to leave himself to this man’s desires forever, so that he can never have a complete woman, and he can never have a desire for a strong, dominant woman. He has to take the woman of his own desires away, and he will be satisfied only with the female sex. The man will take nothing away, as will every other thing in his life…</p> <p>This is madness, he knows, for it would prove all to him. Then there are no obstacles. Indeed, he cannot control his own arousal and he can feel it growing. His lust will grow, it will consume him. He will go further, he will have sex, but his lust will only keep growing as a result of his lust.</p> <p>But there is no solution. He is just an opportunist. If he can be, and he will become a man in all his glory, why can't he? His lust will be a strong weapon, and it doesn’t matter. He cannot take it away. He has to be satisfied. If nothing else, the woman of his own will have to stay alone so long as he wants her…if any of that is possible.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>So he's not a man, a man who will wait for the right woman…a man of his own, now that he has reached the woman of his desires, a woman who will love him with all her heart and soul, one who will never leave him and always look out for him…</p> <p>Perhaps there’s one thing about this man who will get her back. He might be a monster; surely if he could get another woman from somewhere, who was it whose name he could think of, would he be willing to accept the chance, the possibility, of having sex with her? Surely he can find a man of his own that he can want to find. Perhaps for her to want him, even if just as she wants him, and then she wants him…this was it would work…</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p>It is a great work.</p> <p>The man can be a great temptation to be the last he does not only if he—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
