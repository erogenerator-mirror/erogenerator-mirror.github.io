WHAT JOHN RANCE HAD TO TELL.</h4><p><strong>IT was one o’clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a long telegram. He then hailed a</strong> taxi to take me to the house of the house of Mr. Holmes. He then had me lie in his bed. He fucked me. I’d never been so deeply fucked – with anybody’s bare hands at that. He fucked me for ages. He just used my body for his sexual gratification. There were times when I had my legs pinned behind me, and my head was turned so I could look to where the man fucked me, when he reached out and stroked my clitoris. I orgasmed from him, many times. Once I had a man in my mouth, who fucked me all over. I felt his manliness in my mouth – I wanted to taste his, so I did. It was a glorious feeling. I don’t ever imagine sex will be so wonderful. I know not if it was for my career, just when Mr. Holmes said that “He is such a beautiful lover”.</p> <p>After about twenty minutes of fucking, Lauriston Gardens and the home of my father was a little way to my house. I had not heard from Mr. Holmes before, but when the telephone rang I did not have the heart to reach him. His voice was as husky and sweet as his voice indicated. He said that it was my father,” that ‘happened’.</p> <p>It was Mr. Holmes, and he did not ask if I thought he meant that the ‘happen’ was the ‘appearance’. He asked if things were OK, and I nodded in consent. He asked if I had had Mr. Holmes. When I told him that I had done so, and as if his suggestion was obvious, he said, “Is that so, you fool?” “I am the luckiest man in the world,”. I replied that I was not, and he said, “And you are. That is what I mean. That is what Mr. And Mr. Holmes told me. My father said that Mr. Holmes said something about me being good looking I couldn’t hear him. That he said the ‘happen’ was the “happen”, and you would have a man, a man with whom to bed.</p> <p>This conversation was an act, not a word uttered on the telephone, I know. Mr. Holmes asked what the “appen” meant, and I told him the “appen” was to be used for a man’s sexual gratification.</p> <p>Mr. Holmes seemed a little disappointed that I had said Mr. Holmes. But I was sure he understood. So he asked me if I had had Mr. Holmes. I smiled and nodded.</p> <p>“Well, if you are not the young lady I suspected, I do have another question for you.” “There is only Mrs. Holmes that has spoken to you about her marriage and, well, about the sex, she has agreed, but not about it. And you said she is ‘in love with Mr.”? “Yes and she said the sex was wonderful. “She said he is lovely. I know he loves me, but is he always like that or is it more?” “Well I think I get that part very well, you know. When I was your age I thought, you know,” I said, "He is only forty-nine.”</p> <p>We discussed his love, my lack of the sexual desire in me, and his lack of sex. I said, “Oh, well, how are we going to do sex?” He looked at his watch and said, “I want you, now.” I was excited,” and I said, “My mind has not thought much about sex.” We talked about how we should approach the matter. I wanted to have sex with him. That was the moment of truth. He took me to the nearest bedroom, and we undressed together. We lay side-by-side, with my legs at his side. We kissed and the hair on his chest was tickling my nose. His cock and balls were pressing against my vagina. We were naked, and his penis was hard, like a tree spring. He got close and we kissed. We rolled around on the bed, with my legs around his waist. I wanted to feel his dick in me. I told him how good he made me feel. I liked having his tool in my vagina. It’s not too long, but a little gilt is all you will find on a young woman’s vagina. It is soft, at the first place and easy, though you can be great, I think, if a little longer. My first, but the most virgins in a man.
