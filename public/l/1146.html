Cosette, who was rather less dreamy than Marius, was gay, and that sufficed for Jean Valjean’s happiness. The thoughts which Cosette cherished, her tender preoccupations, Marius’</strong>s love, Jean’s kindness; these were her priorities; she was happy.</p> <p>PART III: Marius</p> <p>The kiss in the bathroom was passionate. Marc would have thought an evening of foreplay was all that was on his mind. But Marc had other plans. It was Marc who had taken control of the situation, his arms and legs, making Marius a complete sub, and his desires were very prominent to Marc and their desire to take charge.</p> <p>Marc was aroused by Paris’s attention, her touch, her breasts, and even the thought of the possibilities of being in the position she wanted Marc was making him horny. Marc began to stroke himself when the kissing stopped. With his mouth still half open, Marc’s thoughts began to take center stage; there was little they hadn’t already tried to learn.</p> <p>Marc removed the towel from his face and then kissed the nape of Paris’s neck and the hollow of her throat. He kissed her as he continued to stroke himself, his right hand slipping and caressing down along her right side while his left hand slipped under the towel, brushing her left breast.</p> <p>Marc felt the nipples, hardening, aching under his touch. Marc took his right hand and began to push his right hand between Paris’s legs while he continued to kiss her collarbone. He slipped the towel over Paris’s body, then began to caress her naked skin. Marc kissed her neck again, sliding his hands along her body, and he began to kiss up and down her neck and shoulders.</p> <p>Paris moaned as she felt his hot mouth. Inwardly she was delighted to be getting to know Marc in a way she hadn’t in such short time. But she was afraid Marc would think she was just a tease. To her surprise Marc’s hands made their way down and began to work their way toward her breasts.</p> <p>Paris opened her legs to facilitate the access her nipples had. Marc kissed Paris’s breasts and then began to gently suck each one, his lips and tongue gently tugging the tips. Marc’s thumbs rubbed over Paris’s nipple.</p> <p>Paris moaned and began to push her breasts into Marc’s face. She felt her breasts being sucked on and then she felt the hands in her pussy. Paris arched her back and moaned as Marc's fingers penetrated her.</p> <p>Marc removed his hand and licked the nipple in his mouth. He lifted the nipple toward his lips and closed his lips on it. He ran his lips over the tip of the nipple, sucking it gently, then he moved his head back, the nipple hard in his mouth. He repeated the motion, this time he licked the other nipple, before moving to the first and moving to the middle. Marc’s mouth was moist and hot with a slightly salty taste.</p> <p>Paris was writhing on the bed. Her hands were behind her neck, her head arched back, her eyes open, her mouth open. Marc had moved his mouth to the nipple of the other one and he bit down as he sucked her nipple. But he didn’t go in for the rough treatment he felt he desired. Marc didn’t give it too much of a chance.</p> <p>Paris arched her back and moaned as Marc began to suck her nipple. His hands moved down her abdomen and his fingernails traced down along her belly toward her pussy. Marc touched her clit as he sucked the nipple of the other one. He felt the wetness of her pussy juice. He spread her pussy with his fingers and slid two slickened fingers in as his tongue flicked her right nipple, and then circled her left one.</p> <p>Marc took her tits in his hands, pinching her nipples firmly while his tongue flicked both of her erect nipples.</p> <p>Paris moaned her pleasure, her moans coming from deep in her belly and then building through her breasts to her nipples and back again. Her eyes closed, her body quivering with passion as Marc sucked the right nipple and fingered her clit. Marc’s mouth was soft, but he did not let up and moved his mouth from the other nipple to the left side, flicking it, and then sucking on it and then sliding his tongue into her cleavage.</p> <p>Marc felt his own desire rising. He opened his legs, reaching down with his right hand, he spread Paris’s pussy lips with his fingers and then he started a stroking motion, stroking the walls of her pussy and her clit. Marc found her clit and felt like a vibrator like an electric wand, but was electrically pleasurable and he stroked it through the whole area of her body, the entire length and, while his tongue touched her.</p> <p></p> <p>Paris raised her clitor—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
