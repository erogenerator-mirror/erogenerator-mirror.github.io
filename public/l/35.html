She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened;</strong> she had no idea of what the surprise might have been.</p> <p>"Elizabeth, wake up," Michelle said. "I have a meeting going in ten minutes late. Take a shower and I will be waiting for you."</p> <p>Elizabeth did not want to be late for whatever it was. Still she was naked and she was hoping Michelle wouldn't wake the others up. She took a good, strong shower but had trouble holding off her fear of being caught again by the shower. As she bathed her body Michelle took off her shirt and shorts and Elizabeth was stunned to find herself wearing nothing but her white bra and the matching panty.</p> <p>She stood up to go to Michelle and grabbed her hand again to pull her behind. Michelle let her lead her to the couch until they were in front of one of the other girls. As she pulled Elizabeth on top of her Michelle spread her legs giving Elizabeth a glimpse of her bare pussy.</p> <p>"She is beautiful," Michelle said. "I want her so badly. I can't believe that I said that."</p> <p>"You can't believe that you made love with her the day I left on the island!"</p> <p>"Don't you dare tell anyone where you were going."</p> <p>"Don't you dare say anything to anybody!"</p> <p>"Elizabeth, I have a present for you," Michelle said and kissed Elizabeth's lips.</p> <p>Elizabeth smiled, hugged Michelle and let her go to go and follow Michelle. "Where will I find that one?"</p> <p>The second they went into the bedroom Michelle said, "Elizabeth, get my toy ready and find my collection of toys and books. Put them in the bedroom safe."</p> <p>"You mean, you are not taking me with you?"</p> <p>Michelle laughed and said, "You have the same kind of choice you have with your husband."</p> <p>"Okay, I guess so," Elizabeth said. Then she took a step back letting Michelle get the idea that her naked body was exposed to all who wanted her.</p> <p>Elizabeth heard Michelle leave the room for a moment before she came back with a box of vibrators. "These are all new for you." Michelle started to hand the toys to Elizabeth and said, "These come in different styles and colors. We just might just take them to the party on the island tonight."</p> <p>Elizabeth was surprised Michelle's invitation had been so easy to talk about. She didn't bother looking at Michelle, instead she picked the vibrators up, placed them on the table and said, "I want to take my toys upstairs and use them on you."</p> <p>"Okay, but I don't have too much time."</p> <p>"It would be okay, Michelle."</p> <p>"Okay," Michelle answered, "Just pick the one and pick an orgasm up when I get back."</p> <p>A half hour later Michelle came back into the bedroom dressed in a revealing black lingerie set. "I've got it!" Michelle said.</p> <p>"Do I get a choice when you get back?"</p> <p>"Yes," Michelle said, "but we are going to take our toys upstairs and you will do as you are told."</p> <p>"Is that what you want me to do?"</p> <p>"Yes," Michelle answered. "I wanted to give you time to recover so you can enjoy your orgasm before we continue. Besides, I wanted you to enjoy being in a mood to enjoy your orgasm. What, are you ready?"</p> <p>"I'm ready," Elizabeth said as Michelle reached behind her to unhook her bra, taking it off and revealing her breasts with very large tan nipples.</p> <p>Michelle took it from her and said, "I know you will like mine, so we'll see."</p> <p>"And you will enjoy it!"</p> <p>Elizabeth smiled and put on the vibrating device to feel it against her breasts. She liked it because it made her nipples hard in a different way and also made them feel better. "I like the new looks and feel of the things," she said as she placed the vibrator on her nipples and gave them a hard squeeze. It surprised Elizabeth to see that the vibrating sensations in her breasts and nipples caused her a wave of sexual lust.</p> <p>"Elizabeth, get down and come join us," Michelle commanded.</p> <p>"I'll be right back," Elizabeth said as she went upstairs.</p> <p>Michelle took down the toy and took it out again, sitting it down and said, "I want you to experience your orgasm, and not the rest of it." Then she looked at Elizabeth and added, "Do you understand?"</p> <p>"It will be the best orgasm you've ever had," Elizabeth answered.</p> <p>"The best? What does that mean?"</p> <p>"You will learn a new way to pleasure yourself." "and pleasure yourself" and enjoy" " and to please yourself" and to me."</p> <p></p> <p>"."</p> <p></p> <p>" and... and toâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
