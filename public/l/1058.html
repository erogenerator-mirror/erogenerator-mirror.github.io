It was the only opening through which he could get a glimpse of life. This opening was</strong> the first in years that he did not have a girlfriend. She had been married once and he refused to date women because he was still a virgin. He was twenty-eight and no longer dating young women.</p> <p>He was a successful businessman. He was in the field of Architecture, designing, and Architecture, where he worked. His mother, Toni, was one of the city’s best and brightest architecture experts and he had a chance for the promotion he wanted for his business. He was making good money and he wanted Toni to marry him when he was twenty-eight.</p> <p>They would have an orgy during the next four months. He was about to give his virginity to a woman who was his very own sex doll. She was thirty-one and also an athlete. Toni was also handsome and could be seduced any time. She had been a model and was one of the best body photographers in a city. He was a happy recipient of her love.</p> <p>The day of the celebration was well after midnight. He was a little drunk but was happy to spend his nights with her. He planned the whole meal and had prepared a romantic dinner for their first time.</p> <p>Marius was on the sofa in the living room of the apartment he had rented. His back to the door and had been trying to think what to do about Toni. She was thirty-six and was already one of his most popular conquests. He knew that he had made a fool of himself when she refused to make a move on him. Then, when they got into bed to fulfill their romantic passion, she told him that she wanted his mouth on her body. He was stunned.</p> <p>“You are so gorgeous,” he thought. He was not really sure about her. They only met five years of their marriage. She was married to a millionaire in New York City. He was also a little married because his wife was a whore and his family was wealthy. She was forty-eight and no longer his lover. He decided to just pretend that she was thirty-eight.</p> <p>Toni was a beautiful woman. She was short and lithe. She was slender with smallish breasts. She had a very pretty face. She had very soft and inviting lips. Her eyes were emerald green. Her lips were thin and her eyelashes were green. She had large, bright eyes that looked at you dreamily. She had a small, firm set of breasts that he would want to kiss and eat to get his mouth to suck on them. He imagined what it would be like to have to sit down while she sat down on his lap. He would be unable to sit there and wait.</p> <p>“Hurry up,” he said to her.</p> <p>“It was just a guess.” Her sweet voice was soft and sultry. Her mouth was so inviting.</p> <p>“What happens next,” he said to her as he reached his hand under her short skirt.</p> <p>“Why don’t you sit over there?” The word ‘it’ came out loud and clear. He was getting more and more excited as the minute was approaching. Her voice was sexy and soft. Her body was very pretty. She had just one flaw, however. She had a small, very flat abdomen. The hair on her belly wasn’t very noticeable, though. Her breasts were small and full. Her thighs had an inviting line leading down to an enticing triangle. Her eyes were green. She had the softness of a young woman on her way to the stars. Her face glowed. She had a sensuous mouth that could make anyone drop their pants with any motion. She was also very pretty. She was beautiful. He was getting more than he could handle. His whole self was alive and tingling with excitement. He wanted her. He wanted her badly. But he didn’t know what to do.</p> <p>“No, don’t do it there,” Toni said. She grabbed his hand and brought it to her knee. He could feel the dampness of her pussy under the short skirt. She lifted her right foot. She was wet and she wanted him. “No, stop,” she said and put her hand on his lap.</p> <p>Marius was a little surprised. He didn’t know how to react. He couldn’t move his hands to her leg. He didn’t know where he could get up. But his hands were like iron. He started stroking her thigh while continuing to try to find her pussy. He had been in this position every morning. When it was the day all morning, his body was made up to move to move up. Today time. It was all in the moment. He used all the moment. He was what happened in time to move around the other way up—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
