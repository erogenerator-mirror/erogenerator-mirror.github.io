I didn't know you'd be so happy for me to get my stuff," Anna said.</p> <p>"Yes you can, Baby," Mrs. Palmer assured her child, standing to hug Anna again. They both fell to the floor, breathing hard as their embrace faded.</p> <p>Mrs. Palmer put aside the chair where her daughter had been sitting, the new love now in the middle of the floor.</p> <p>"I've got it," she said.
