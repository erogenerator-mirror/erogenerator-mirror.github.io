As we say commonly, The physician hath prescribed unto this man,</h4><p><strong>riding; unto another, cold baths; unto a third, to go barefoot: so it is alike to say, The nature of the universe hath prescribed unto this man sickness, or blindness,</strong> or a disease, or a disease, and that, though his body be yet in need of repair, he can be thus.</p> <p>In my father's day, a man's body was not to be reputed in the eyes of the people. It was not to be a commodity, either a body or in its most intimate areas. This is evident from the time that my fathers day was observed. My father's body, was more refined by his own hand than I am.</p> <p>It is the same in my day. Though in my father's day, he was an eunuch, a mere mortal, he was of pure birth, of the father of the earth in which he belonged.</p> <p>This, in turn, is the same day, and the same woman I once knew, was never more than a child, but was born in her mid-twenties. In the day where it is not, however, a woman, as in the day of a child, was a woman with child.</p> <p>Thus, it is like to say, the nature of our lives begins to change and thus it can become an ancient, ancient time in which there are no exceptions, and we are brought before the gates of our world. My father's body is a gift to mankind, which is so much the same as in the case of men, from which none may be born again. My own body, is a gift, which I have inherited, from his father.</p> <p>There is no end to sexual intercourse, only a point in which you will have occasion so that a man can be truly comfortable in his sex life. Such intercourse may become pleasurable if, for example, it is taken from a woman, when she has just completed her monthly climax, and has been allowed to lie upon him afterwards.</p> <p>I have no such luck. I must be like a young girl, to be allowed to lay upon her father. It is not easy, but I have taken to it and have taken it.</p> <p>When a man, on his back, spreads his legs, he will hold them up high and open. That is such a lovely position, in which his cock will press between the cheeks of female flesh. That is so much more pleasant to hold. My sister and I have been taught that such positions require such a touch. We can feel it, on our hands.</p> <p>While we are thus taught, we must have some experience of sexual intercourse.</p> <p>It is the moment that my father, in his day, was taken by his father, when he lay upon my father's body, and his father's cock slid over the lips of my sisters, my own, at length, until his own cock, at this moment, was buried itself in my sisters ass, in her tight asshole. It was not his father. Not his father. Not that he is. His father, was my father's father, my father's son, the father of all of them.</p> <p>At this moment, they exchanged sexual intercourse as if it were their mating season. In those moments we experienced each other by ourselves, so to speak, on the night before the birth of the first child. We have done so. We have both had our first sex.</p> <p>The second time, it was we, as my mother and I, first to father, his son, to father. And so there have been the differences, in which they have been the mother and son, both to the end of the world's existence, as the world's oldest society.</p> <p>There are some that say I should have a daughter, who shall be my own when the time is right, or for me to be their daughter. But the other will think I am nothing at all like my father. In which I am so much the older, I have failed.</p> <p>There are others who say such things. I agree with that, for I have never failed, no matter where it has been taken from the father of the world.</p> <p>When we have experienced our first sex, in our bodies, I shall be to the end with one, the youngest of all who shall be born, with a child. But, no, that is not to be. Nor shall I fail, either in my father or in the mother of the world, for she will be the mother of both. Nor will I be to fail in every other direction; for in all or most of those ways the choice will be mine.</p> <p>That is what love, all that was love, were, I suppose, when I was a child was. That is a thing neither of love can be, for in it is, I suppose, what a person thinks, without their knowledge.</p> <p>I think we, in our minds and hearts, have fallen in love; love as the people are not to all that is to fall upon the world. But that are as the world's a part in and the people, to be a part, loveâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
