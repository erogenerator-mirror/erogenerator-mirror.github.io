English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>XVIII. OLD AND YOUNG WOMEN.</h4><p><strong>“Why stealest thou along so furtively in the twilight, Zarathustra? And what hidest thou so carefully under thy mantle? Is it a treasure that hath been given thee? Or a</strong> gift that must, by God, be treasured?”</p> <p>And all that, I'll say, and tell thee, after I have finished,” I said.</p> <p>And then, like an angel's wings flapping with the beat of a happy song that had just come to the surface, I turned to my lover and kissed her. Our tongues entwined. I opened my lips to share a sweet kiss. I wanted to say something, anything, to reassure her of her devotion, but that only led to us kissing on that beautiful morning.</p> <p>And that was as far as she got when we finally stopped kissing. After that brief moment, she grabbed my cock again, rubbed it up and down the slit until it was just barely visible inside her panties. I thought she would drop to her knees and suck it, but instead she sat in the tub and opened her legs to present it to me once again.</p> <p>And then she lay back and spread her legs and put her feet on the edge of the bathtub, her knees bent and her feet and heels pointing up toward me. And I moved forward, lowered myself and placed myself at her opening and pushed my cock inside her.</p> <p>There was a wonderful moment when my cock was buried in her, and I felt her walls stretch around me. I kissed her mouth. I whispered her name. I made her lie down and felt her legs open and guide me slowly into her. We kissed and I made her lie down again. Then I pulled out, turned onto my back, and kissed my way down her chest, to her belly, and then to the top of her pussy.</p> <p>I kissed my way over her belly and then moved my face in closer and ran my lips on her pussy. When I finally touched my lips on it, it was like my tongue was caressing her, but more direct. And I could feel her wetness, all slippery inside.</p> <p>I slid down her body and kissed her neck from behind. Then her earlobes, then her collarbone, and finally her lips. I kissed down further to her nipples before returning to her lips. And I kissed and kissed and kissed down to her navel.</p> <p>Then I began kissing her legs, slowly pulling my mouth up her thigh until I reached her pussy. And I slowly moved my tongue back along its path. This time, when she raised her bottom and spread herself wider for me, I touched just the tip of my tongue tip on her asshole.</p> <p>“What are you doing here, Zarathustra?” she said.</p> <p>I moved my face up to her pussy again and licked it some more, again moving my tongue just the tip of it where she wanted it. So that her pussy was completely lubricated, I moved my hips back so that my cock was pressing against her ass.</p> <p>Then I slowly reached my hands around between her legs and found her little pussy lips, which I began caressing with my fingers. All the while, I slid my tongue back along her pussy lips.</p> <p>She spread her legs wider and moaned, “Kiss me here, now.”</p> <p>I moved my tongue in between her lips and circled around to the front of the inside of her pussy, teasing her. Then I pressed my tongue against her clit and circled it slowly so that she began rocking her hips and thrusting her pussy in my mouth. I could taste her wetness as I slid my tongue out and tasted the inside of her pussy.</p> <p>But when I sucked on her clit, she began bucking her hips up and down. And I continued working my tongue over her clit until she was nearly crying out. And when she came, a small shriek, I kept working my tongue over it until she finally pulled my hair to make me stop.</p> <p>“Ahh, you bastard,” she said.</p> <p>I rolled her over. Then I lowered myself down and kissed her. Then I held myself above her while I started licking her again.</p> <p>I kissed her mouth and nibbled on her ear and earlobe. She kept moaning and her hips were thrusting against my mouth. Finally, I moved off of her and lay beside her, kissing her.</p> <p>“Why, Zarathustra,” I said softly, “why can you not be so sweet like this? I am, after all, a man who likes to be a slut in bed. Aren't you a little harlot who loves to be with a real man? Who wants to give you a good fucking?”</p> <p>She kissed me back. “Oh, you're just tell me,” she said.</p> <p></p> <p>“But now I want you feel how you can be a slut in a harlot,’t be a fucar, I can make, not a—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
