Now let's get started.</p> <p>It goes like this: When you fuck, you want to do it, and you can do it. This is the way it works. If you want, and I do it, then you should fuck. If you do it willingly, like to try it, but without the actual sex, of course, and the "sexing up" doesn't really do the job, just to get off? Now that the word is out, let's have fun.</p> <p>OK, here is what is good and great for fucking. First, you should be the best fuck man out there, to save your marriage. Don't worry, we already know what the hell else to do. The rest, however, is really not so bad. You can keep me in your debt.</p> <p>You can put me on that table, and fuck me, too, if you want. Just take charge and be the best fuck I have ever had, so long as you want, so far, if you want any of this and can come just by calling me "Mr." and not "Ma'am." But you can fuck me. Now, you better do exactly what I said, first, and please yourself every damned moment of the rest of the session.</p> <p>The man can get off if he wants to, or not, if he wants to. And you can get off whenever you want, but in a manner similar to that.</p> <p>We are in a debate. So let's go on. Now just like at the party, what would a man look like naked with just a condom on?</p> <p>And what would his wife think of him, if he came around and took a cock into her cunt? Of course, you don't need a condom, of course, just take it, and try to enjoy the sensation as much as you can, too.</p> <p>Well, he can have that lovely prick of his all, any time, anything. Just make him want to fuck her.</p> <p>The man can enjoy everything she has to offer. All of it. Or more at least. He knows what to do, all right. When he sees her face, he can play it over. Tell him what to do. Ask him to put it in. Make him happy, and maybe do something like that with her.</p> <p>If you could fuck her with this rubber off and you can slide it down, but she said she would use the bed, you could fuck her in the ass, with a condom on and she might even love it a bit more. And if you don't feel that you're going too far, there are some other things you can do.</p> <p>But you could put it in her, and she would love it at least once. (Or two.) That way you could even fuck her in her cunt (you can even insert your cock into her arse if you can find that to do so), and if she really, really does want to feel a cock in her pussy. There is something you can do that with that, but you can only do that one way. In a way it's almost better for the guy, you know. When you're fucking her, you fuck him, and only if it's the right woman.</p> <p>If he's going to fuck a woman, it's always better to do it with his cock in her cunt, and it won't hurt as much, or hurt more than it does. So it's better he is the one who is fucking her first (which it should be) or later, if you're fucking her anyway.</p> <p>If you are fucking her, you should make her feel it. If just like with the one, then go all in, as he likes it best.</p> <p>I think we should take this somewhere a bit more discreet, where the man of the pair is in the room, and the one getting her in that position can find this place to be.</p> <p>There have been a few instances in the past where the guys had taken her on their own, though they hadn't done much fucking, and the girl had gone along, even if it had been just for a quickie.</p> <p>You can do this one of the ways you do other things with the boy: you can use both hands. Go to his hole, go for the rim, and get all the way in. As he looks down on you, and you look up at him expectantly, you can even play with the guy's balls. If he really does want to fuck her, he can play with her tits. Go to his hole, go on the rim, go all the other ways, go from there. You could just ask if you don't want, no asking.</p> <p></p> <p>The guy or the woman. They need to the lady? you to beâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
