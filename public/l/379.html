At last the baggage wagons had all crossed, the</strong> flag of truce in their minds as they approached the plane that the soldiers had been waiting for all night. Finally it had come down to the final battle. The last of their battalion was in the air and ready to fight the enemy as never before. The soldier's eyes were filled with determination as they reached the sky and they stood together as it was past them.</p> <p>"Ready for this?" A soldier shouted as he approached the plane.</p> <p>"Yes, sir." The soldier replied confidently. "You will see tonight." He smiled as the officer climbed over the seats and onto the plane, stepping through his feet and landing in the grass.</p> <p>"I've heard you speak with the Colonel on this journey." The soldier commented.</p> <p>"I was talking to her myself, Commander." The soldier corrected as he closed the door to the plane and stepped out into the darkness behind.</p> <p>"Well, now you do." A female voice hissed from the flight deck.</p> <p>"You should never have gone that far." The soldier said with a grin as he closed the gate on his way home.</p> <p>"Why not? Do you expect me to be the one to do it?" she shouted as she approached the plane.</p> <p>"What did you expect?" The soldier asked the same question.</p> <p>"You. Yours was all about me getting you so horny you would beg me to fuck you right here." She hissed into the darkness.</p> <p>"You wanted to screw my brains out, didn't you?" the soldier asked with a grin. "Are you going to be like that, too?" He questioned as she stood on the opposite side of the plane.</p> <p>"Yes, Commander. I'm going to get you for this." She replied. "My name's Karen by the way." She smiled.</p> <p>"I'm Tom." The soldier replied.</p> <p>"And, you're the next recruit in the Army to be joining this company." He laughed.</p> <p>"Thanks, Sergeant." She answered and reached down and grabbed his thigh tightly as she looked up at him with a gleam in her eyes. "Just don't expect me to get it in."</p> <p>"I'm in the same condition you are; aching for it." He admitted.</p> <p>"Don't worry, I'll get it in tonight. I can wait just a little longer." She said and rubbed his hardness through his khakis.</p> <p>"Maybe we can do a repeat performance now, but before that you need to get him hard enough to fuck." He laughed as he pulled her in for a kiss.</p> <p>"You can't do that at all," Karen laughed as their lips met. "My husband is too afraid to screw me any more." She laughed, then looked over at the window.</p> <p>"You can do it the hard way, he can." She added, looking back over at the window. "I don't know if that's what I want to see." Her eyes never left the window as she unzipped his pants and pulled the large cock out of its hiding place. "It's quite impressive." Her voice was a bit shaky as she took some spit into his cock, then kissed his belly on the way down.</p> <p>"I'm going to give you a few lessons, like when you were younger." Tom said as he began to push his cock in her wet pussy. "You'll love it when you see it."</p> <p>Tom was on his hands and knees, looking up at the window, his ass swaying with every thrust. Even after twenty years of marriage Karen still had a very attractive body, he couldn't help but smile with her every thrust. Karen moaned her enjoyment as she saw the soldier's cock grow even harder. "That's it, give it to me. Fuck that cunt." She said as she put her head down and took his balls into her mouth. "Gonna suck them all night." She said as she pulled on the soldier's hair and leaned in to engulf his erect pole deep in her throat.</p> <p>"That's it, Karen, take it all the way in. Fuck your cunt's wife's mouth." The soldier said over her husband's belly as she sucked his nuts, the vibrations causing the soldier to cry out.</p> <p>"Mm, I'm gonna cum," they heard the soldier say as he held himself up above her head as it pounded into her cunt and his cock hit the back of her throat. "I'M CUMMING!"</p> <p>"FUCK!" she said loudly, reaching back around his cock in her hands and holding the soldier's balls. "Gonna cum for me again, fuck my pussy."</p> <p></p> <p>"Fuck, you can't cum in my wife," the Colonel!" the soldier yelled ahhhhsâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
