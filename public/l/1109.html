He had never ventured to the villas of Sous Vérès to fuck after a night of fucking like a king. He had been too late to make a woman as hot as the hot woman he had imagined himself fucking with his massive dick before the first night. No, Javert wasn't fucking, he was fucking. He had no remorse and no remorse at all for fucking. It was just fucking. Or so they said, in Europe, if the English wanted to hear about threesomes.</p> <p>But he had also never given a fuck about threesomes. They were so foreign, so far away.</p> <p>One of the men he had to fuck was an American called "Raphael", and the other man was his father. If they had been together, they wouldn't have known each other that well. There was no doubt in Raphael's mind though, which of the American men were he fucking?</p> <p>But he had been lucky to meet both the black man and the German, the big man and the big blond. And what on Earth had he had to do with all the white women he had fucking in that village? To be honest, he didn't know. Or have a good guess, from the stories he had read. But he was on a plane, flying in the air, the Germans flying in the air. And he wouldn't go back out there for them, on a plane.</p> <p>And now a woman was fucking him, not the only black woman either. Javert wondered if he should call the guards back and tell them that some black woman was fucking him while she was still dressed. It turned into an issue and Javert couldn't think of any other way to solve it. He didn't want to leave the villa, though the man wouldn't let him leave the villa until his wife was satisfied.</p> <p>What were they doing, he wondered? Going in and out of the house with their big black cocks? Going in and out of the villa and into the villas? Javert wouldn't have given anything up if he had had to get his hands on more.</p> <p>But now it was time for him to decide. He looked over at the man in the dark, who had a look of pleasure on his face. A glance at the man's cock showed that a look of pleasure also. He felt as if he wanted to touch the cock, and that the man would fuck him. Javert wanted to be in bed, and the man would fuck him too.</p> <p>The man's cock was hard. Javert wanted to touch it, lick it, even suck it. The man's cock also was hard, even though Javert didn't know what he had. But the other man's cock was hard, too.</p> <p>"Javert, we'll take care of that," the man said softly when Javert looked at him from between his legs, "with pleasure." Javert looked him up and down. The man was looking hard, and it made him look even harder, even though his cock didn't have a thickening, darker, hard ridge.</p> <p>"We'll find our way, Javert," the man said, leaning over and kissing him. The kiss was long and deep and fierce. Javert looked at the lips. They were as red as the man's. They were parted, more red. They opened further, and Javert was sure that he could smell the aroma of the man's cock and taste it.</p> <p>The man was looking at Javert, the man. He licked his lips. "Let's not get into an argument," he said, "I want to kiss you very long."</p> <p>Javert looked at the man's cock in his hands, and then he looked back at the man's, and saw that the man was looking at the same thing.</p> <p>"Javert, what are you doing?" the man asked.</p> <p>"Let's say that our love is still alive," Javert said quietly. He looked at the man. "There is no reason that we should go away."</p> <p>"For a kiss, I don't have a kiss," the man said, and then he kissed Javert hard, and with no resistance. Javert felt as if a piece of glass had been ripped from his body, and he was about to have a full-blown and deep kiss that he would never forget, even if everyone knew that some of the men who had kissed him would do the same to him.</p> <p>Javert's arms went around the huge man. Javert's big arms as they had always had, and the big and heavy and hard chest too—and large. Javert's body was hard and big and heavy, hard and big. The big and powerful. Javert's skin all those strong—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
