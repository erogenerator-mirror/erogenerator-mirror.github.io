Strange, stiff garments were upon my body; garments that cracked and powdered away from me as I rose to a sitting</strong> position. I remembered my brief encounter with my friends and how our dildos and vibrators had been switched on. My mind went on, but I found it a little too far past normal. I was still horny; the images of these two guys fucking me had aroused me once again. I had wanted to fuck myself on some of those dildos with an image of them sliding in and out of my pussy. This fantasy would not do; I would be too sore. It was a dream. I opened my eyes to find that one of my arms had somehow wound itself around the duvet.</p> <p>"You didn't have to go that way."</p> <p>It was the voice of my husband, Richard. I had felt uneasy about his casual indifference to me but had not really acknowledged it at that moment. It wasn't really all that different from my usual casual indifference. I had seen him naked many times and had always thought about his cock, which I had enjoyed stroking. Now I felt his strong hands caressing my bare arm. He had told me he loved to hold my hand in his lap and fondle me while I masturbated and the thrill I had felt when he had held my other arm was as thrilling as the first time. I closed my eyes again as I imagined his hands holding my breasts, his fingers caressing my nipples and then sliding down to finger my vagina from top to bottom. I thought of the pleasure of doing just that and how his fingers had played with my clitoris when I had tried to insert my fingers into myself. It had been a real thrill but also an incredible one. Now he had taken that step. I felt his fingers touch my buttocks; he pushed a finger up inside me and I let out a long moan. It had been too much. I felt my body shaking, waves of trembling pleasure were building in my body. He had gently moved my hand away from his lap, away from him and up between my legs. I had wanted him to take me but now, I felt a moment of regret.</p> <p>"Open for me," he whispered. I opened my eyes to see him again, still looking into my eyes. He looked at me. He held my face between his hands and kissed my lips tenderly. I could taste the bitter taste of my arousal on his lips. It was as if our tongues were one. Without a word he raised himself above me and moved his face down to my breasts.</p> <p>"My hands are full," I said weakly. We had often teased each other about how much we liked to be called "sister and brother" even if, as we might later say, we had misconstrued the term. The first time I had known what it meant meant that I had been sure that we were brother and sister. He had been the first person I had ever kissed on my husband's mouth but we had both never gone any further than that. So now we both understood it. My mouth opened and my tongue darted forward to press against his.</p> <p>"Don't move," he whispered. His hand was still between my legs but was now pressing down on mine. "Relax," he continued, "I want to feel how wet you are." His other hand had resumed their journey, which he had pulled on me when he kissed me. I could feel movement but no pressure at all.</p> <p>I had felt his finger, not in the middle of my vagina but in the very end of my pussy. I remembered that he had done the same in my pussy. I could not tell what he was feeling because the tip of his finger had stopped to explore the outer lips. His finger ran over my clitoris. It felt incredible. It was something that had happened in the past. I could feel it on the tip of my husband's finger. It had been an odd sensation, but again, it was unlike in most other sexual experiences I had enjoyed.</p> <p>"That makes me so wet," he groaned. I felt the heat increase as he continued, "You feel so good. That feels good, you're so wet." His finger explored my slit and as far as I could go, but my thighs resisted.</p> <p>"Now you need to touch me." I did not wait for an answer, but instead put my hand between his legs and felt his penis. He was still clothed but his cock was rock hard. I looked at the huge penis that I had seen standing above. It was at least 11 inches long, maybe more and bigger as well. It was thick, well cut and a little over average. The tip of his cock was very purple and a drop of precum oozed from its eye. I was in desperate need to taste it. I pushed my face closer to his cock, which he had not had not yet touched and I took in hand with mine before. We had been in the urgency. We kissed. He brought my mouth on my lips.
