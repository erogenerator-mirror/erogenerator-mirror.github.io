But, especially if the man was a lover, and he also had an orgasm, (with a woman, or with a man), he made a decision about whether or not he wanted to screw her, (with no hesitation, or remorse,) or for the other to make up her mind whether or not she wanted to fuck the guy, (or, for more than just sucking), or what to do about it.</p> <p>The word orgasm was always so exciting to people, (men) in general, when one was drunk, (Women,) in particular.</p> <p>The phrase "orgasm" or "orgasm" is rarely used in this context. It is too strong, too often used, in this context. The word orgasm seems to be taken too close to the mark of orgasm. Thus, is not a man an orgasm, a woman an orgasm, (or a woman, or a man).</p> <p>This is the case of this definition of an orgasm. As men are born to experience it, all the definitions herein are of man, and men are born to feel the sexual sensation of their own orgasmic pleasure. (It is as important as the definition of an orgasm.) Therefore, I will define this definition.</p> <p>To define an orgasm is the pleasure of a woman.</p> <p>To define a woman's pleasure is by the person that it is the pleasure that she feels.</p> <p>An orgasm is a moment spent in a physical experience.</p> <p>An orgasm is a process of pleasure that takes up to a portion of the body.</p> <p>An orgasm is a part of the mind.</p> <p>An orgasm is a sensation experienced that requires the body to be in the process of orgasm, through the mind.</p> <p>An orgasm is a feeling of extreme pleasure, by having sex within the mind.</p> <p>An orgasm is a feeling of the mind that allows the body to have the pleasure that a woman can have.</p> <p>An orgasm is a sensation that is a pleasure that requires the body to have the pleasure that a woman can have.</p> <p>An orgasm is an experience that requires the body to have that body in its entirety without the body being lost in the pleasure that is so uniquely male, (Man), in the enjoyment of having sex.</p> <p>An orgasm is what is happening in the way that a human body, in a single moment, will have the pleasure, (or pleasure), of having sex at the moment in which that which is that which is the most important thing in the whole world has become irrelevant.</p> <p>An orgasm is a feeling of ultimate ecstasy that the body has found, and that is the feeling that is unique to the individual that it has found.</p> <p>An orgasm is a sensation not merely sexual, as is not only of sexual pleasures, but physical ones, (though some are better) than of sexual pleasures, (though some do not have such pleasures).</p> <p>An orgasm is a feeling of sublime satisfaction, (the purest bliss that God has bestowed upon the universe).</p> <p>An orgasm is of a spiritual quality, (to a certain degree).</p> <p>An orgasm is of a spiritual quality such as spiritual contentment.</p> <p>An orgasm is of a purely physical experience whereby one is fully aware of another's presence.</p> <p>An orgasm is of a spiritual experience whereby one is aware of the other's presence.</p> <p>An orgasm is of a sexual experience whereby one can achieve an orgasm in a physical fashion, (for example, the act of fucking, or sucking, that is so highly erotic that it is pleasurable).</p> <p>An orgasm is of a combination between bodily activities that are in the body and mind.</p> <p></p> <p>An orgasm is not simply sexual, or sexual or physical.
