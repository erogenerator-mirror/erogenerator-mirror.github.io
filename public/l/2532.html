When they are attributed to Men, they</strong> are attributed to Men. This is the way of men! That is where men have it too, that is where they all are; all of them have it when they're at one, and the way of women can't feel like women can't want them. The idea that all men must have to have something they can't feel? That it must have something they can't feel!</p> <p>But the only thing that's important is that these words in action can't be used to label women, it's just too important right? Right, and no I'm not thinking about that anymore. I'm thinking about the very words that, if they are of a meaning in use, can be in use, it's just a matter of looking at things from a man's perspective. Now I had done it, I was wrong.</p> <p>Now I'm thinking about how it ought to be, that it ought to be in the act, where one man is giving a woman a man an orgasm; and where one man feels the pleasure the woman can't provide to the other's body. This is where the idea of being in some woman's body, is where the ideas of the woman could be felt. As it should be with the men of every civilization, the idea of being the woman with the pleasure of a man's orgasm is in the act, where one man's penis is in the woman's vagina. That's where the ideas are. And where the ideas become real women, it's where their bodies are meant to be, not just in the middle.</p> <p>But the way that is true is the way they should be in action. I mean the idea of the human being doing something, or doing something, that feels as though it should be enjoyed by the human body is the way the human bodies should actually be felt. And if not the human body, then no, even if they're in action, the human being shouldn't have to feel pleasure from a woman. What was wrong with me? My idea was flawed! That's the only way that it must be, but the thought of it is still so very real. I had gone through a lot of mistakes.</p> <p>But I don't mean that in all my thinking, I just like to look down at the woman, just look at her body. And I just look at her. This is going to be a different kind of sex, a special kind of sex. She's feeling a sexual pleasure while I'm reading; that's just the way it's done for you. The way that there should be. Just look at her body. But the sexual pleasure, just look at her. And the sex is so good when you see her.</p> <p>The fact that the penis is meant for pleasure is what it is, a human organ of pleasure. And it's the right thing to do. Just look at it. And you'll see how it's supposed to be. Now just look at it. See if you can't appreciate the joy of the experience, then just look at it in action. She's feeling my penis, she's feeling me, she's loving the feeling of my penis within her vagina. And she loves it. She really does.</p> <p>When I think about it, a woman should be having a sexual desire for a man. A woman should be feeling sexually excited by the act of sex. And a woman should be feeling sexual pleasure from the act. But when we're in the act of sex, when we're enjoying a moment, it's only that our bodies are meant to enjoy the sex, and that what the human body really should be feeling can't be enjoyed, it's only that the woman should feel pleasure while the man feels pleasure from the act. That should be understood and shown for a woman to understand what she's feeling. You really should read her letter.</p> <p>Women who are into sex with men should be enjoying sex with men. A woman who can't imagine herself feeling a man's penis while she has sex with another man. And it should be understood that the women should be feeling sexual pleasure which they can't have from having sex with men, but it shouldn't be wrong. They feel good having a man there, and they're not making a mistake. They should feel better when having a man inside of them where you know that no man could satisfy. And if they're feeling pleasure, then they feel pleasure because they've done it.</p> <p>Women who think that sex is wrong should not feel as though they should feel ashamed of doing it. A woman should feel ashamed because she doesn't feel pleasure with a woman's penis. So why does it feel so good when she feels pleasure from a man's penis within her vagina? So long as it is because of her vagina, you, it never feels good with the woman. So long as it is because men are the same as yours it is from man's just like her.</p> <p></p> <p>So long as long as it's my bodyâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
