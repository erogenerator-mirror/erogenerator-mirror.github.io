As it started to work its way forward, and was heading off, I glanced at the other guys, and noticed that there was a smile on their faces. That got me really interested.</p> <p>When the boat was about half mast in a channel and about a hair's breadth off shore, two guys stood up, took a seat, then came forward. One of the guys was called Brad, and had a great pair of ass cheeks. The other dude was a nice-looking guy. We were sitting on the side of the boat, and we were talking and joking with each other.</p> <p>"Hey, guy," I asked, "What's yours name?"</p> <p>"My name is Jim, and I'm the director of the boat. You?"</p> <p>"Honey, I'm Brad, the director of the yacht."</p> <p>"I've never met a man with a boat, but then, I am probably going to," Brad teased, as he reached over and started to stroke my dick as I spoke.</p> <p>"You do have an ass on the yacht, don't you, hubby?" the blonde said to his friend, as she reached over to fondle it.</p> <p>"A bit," Brad laughed, "But she's got great meat there. She even has a nice ass." Then, he reached under his body to cup a tit, and started to rub them with his hardening nipples. At that point, the blonde guy came over and started to suck on a nipple, and Brad leaned down to lick his asshole. That brought me to the realization that my little wife had been a virgin until very recently. I had gone out as a virgin with Brad in high school, in fact. She had been in a relationship, the couple we were to settle down with, and had been married less than a year before. Now she was trying to be with a total stranger.</p> <p>My eyes went back to my wife while she stroked my cock with one hand as she fondled a tit. "You sure are, Babe," Brad murmured, stroking her hair in his hand, watching her suck on her tit and rub her tits with a hand.</p> <p>I had been looking at a picture of my wife in the photo, and now I had a real close up. Not only had I seen the ass, I could see most of it. Her butt cleavage, the backs of her thighs with just the sides of her thighs, and the lips of her pussy were a clear pink with pink, swollen lips. While I was still looking, my hands were busy, sliding over the others chest, playing with breasts, and playing with dick.</p> <p>Suddenly, the guy on the boat leaned in to lick my wife's nipples. My wife had gotten the whole thing as a double-decker, and we had really got into it. She had her head back and was moaning as the guys sucked her nipples. He took a hand away from her breast and started to rub her pussy with it. She was already pretty relaxed about oral sex, and was not going to be any time soon.</p> <p>The guy, now sitting on the side, leaned down to kiss her on the mouth, and she responded eagerly. He lifted her up, so that she sat next to him on the side, straddling him, and kissing him and rubbing his dick up and down her slit. This was the main thing going the other way, kissing at the same time. My wife was really letting them know how she liked to be touched, and her body responded. I could see as they looked at each other, their bodies moving with desire, their eyes drinking in the sight of each other. One was breathing hard, while the other was just sitting still, staring at the others mouth, as he let her guide his dick inside her.</p> <p>She pulled her mouth away from his. "Don't you fuck me," she said, and I think she meant that she wanted the other guy in the boat to sit out there. He rose, and the two guys got onto their knees, and he kneeled down on the seat. They both watched as his dick started to move back and forth in my wife, as she sucked on him. I stood to watch them. The guy had lifted her legs up and spread one, while he pulled her pussy back toward his dick. The next time he thrust his dick up, I could hear them groan with passion. The first guy had her on her back now, with her legs back, and was licking and sucking her labia as her pussy was being spread by the second guy's dick.</p> <p>-head on her tits, she was moving up and so my wife could rub myself.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>like his tongue on and to get the tip—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
