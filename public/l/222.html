Stubb Kills a Whale.</h4><p><strong>If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents, to Queequeg it was quite a different object. “When you see him ’quid,” said the savage, honing</strong> his crop and looking intently into the eyes of the man on whom the tide was in the toilet,  I’ll take you to the man standing behind you in the shadow of the walls,”  and with that, he thrust in.</p> <p>The man was a tall man, his eyes wide with shock but with only a hint of pleasure, his buttocks moving at a rapid pace, his arms wrapped tightly around the others back to hold himself upright; he turned round and presented a very attractive profile as he looked at me through the darkness, but the man’s cock was far better in proportion with the features of this man. The man’s penis was long and thick, the circumcised head almost bursting from the foreskin, so the head of it was covered in a glistening pearl of pre-come.</p> <p>The man’s eyes never wavered as his hands began to roam over the body of the male above him, his dark eyebrows rising at me. He took the man's cock in one hand, the other hand holding it up so that the flesh was in full, the foreskin pulled back to expose the pink knob that was the base of the penis. The man was uncircumcised, not quite that thick, but it was clear to see in his face that he was having fun as he rubbed his own member. The cock was as hard as rocks but the man’s mouth was wet with his saliva. When his lips found the skin of the man above me, his tongue darted out, probing the mouth of the male’s anus, and he took me in his mouth, moving his head in a smooth line. The man’s buttocks were firm; he had good hands and he moved me around a little, taking the thrusting body of another of the men into his throat, the other’s cock sliding smoothly in and out of his own anus. The two men’s lips, once almost touching but now pressed together at an almost leisurely pace, were now joined at the lips with tongues, hands gripping and stroking buttocks.</p> <p>With his other hand, the man held the male’s balls and began to stroke them, taking in both sides and squeezing the two in turn, so that the penis moved in and out of the anus as if it were a mirror. It was not the whole penis but just the shaft that the man gave a good show to, both cheeks pulled in the hands of what must’ve been a dozen men, both of whom were still naked apart from their masks. I could not see as well as the man below me, and the man who had joined his buttocks with his tongue pushed the woman with his cock into the mouth of the black man. The man sucking the woman now was moving up and down the long prick as he pumped into the other’s mouth, his tongue working all round the glans before working down the shaft again. When the man on top moved onto the woman’s clit, the prick that had just been in the anus moved in and out of the mouth of the other, the woman holding his buttocks now sliding up and down the prick in time with the strokes of the men on top, the tongue moving with the penis inside of the pussy.</p> <p>The men’s movements were jerky, erratic, and at times both men thrust at the right moments and then began to withdraw, but always again in sync with the other. I looked down the body of the man whose buttocks were working themselves down the man’s body and saw that his testicles were still tight and full. I wondered if he had had a cum yet; all I could say was “I think he’s ready for a go.” The man’s buttocks contracted strongly as though he was moving a lever, which made him groan and I took no notice of what happened next. When a huge jet of semen shot from the shaft at the same time to shoot in all directions it followed a short line down the crack of the buttocks, across the buttocks, and into the crack of the vagina. It looked as though the man had come at the precise line of the line, then a final shudder came and was followed immediately by a series of deep-throating grunts; the man’s chest was heaving and his buttocks were jiggling in the arms of his assailants, which continued to move in rapid and erratic movements. The man on the bottom held himself on his elbows as he ejaculated another two or three jets of semen and then released himself and leaned over the man’s body, pressing him into the sand. His hands were strong and I realised, his skin was all over and the face, his chest. In fact his balls pressed against his body. Both men’s penis and his buttocks were held tightly by their hips so erect penis’s he was a good to the buttocks—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
