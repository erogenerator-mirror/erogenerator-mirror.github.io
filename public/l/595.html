On benches round the tables in a dirty little room</strong> were women of varying ages, all wearing clothes, and all naked in various places – from cottages to cars.</p> <p>"How could he be so drunk?" whispered another voice in the smoky, noisy room.</p> <p>"I think he's a doctor," said a slightly tanned, red-haired-haired woman of my age.</p> <p>She reached into glasses and produced an old medical glass, a medical glass that seemed like it was out of a plastic bag. A small, round device glowed behind its glass-walled surface and buzzed on with a steady hum in time with the music. I was just finishing my fourth pint when the music changed. The light changed again.</p> <p>"Here comes the doctor from the pharmacy," announced the man. "I must visit for a few minutes before the next doctor comes through."</p> <p>He had a long thick cock that was jutting out and curved up, making the whole thing swing. My boyfriend had never seen one this big; it looked like a porno! The foreskin rubbed up and down the long vein running the underside of the circumcised head. The head of his long black cock looked huge.</p> <p>"How old is this thing?"</p> <p>"My friends call it a 'griving'. The girls at work would go crazy when I'd have it. The guys at work would go crazy whenever I took it, too. What's your name?"</p> <p>"I'm Christian," I answered. I didn't know any better at the moment, anyway. How did Christian know my name? I don't know much about him – how do you know a man? What makes him so familiar?</p> <p>"I heard it was something you had to use for your doctor's appointment, when you'd been having problems with your breasts."</p> <p>He smiled and went on.</p> <p>"It's what all young boys with big penises do when they go to the supermarket with a customer. They always start with bananas, and later on you have to buy some milk or milk on their own. What's your name?"</p> <p>He was talking to a girl across the room.</p> <p>"I'm Christina," she said. "I'd be happy to have my boobs sucked. You can go on all you want, you know."</p> <p>Christina was standing right beside me, her hands on my tits as her head bobbed up and down, her body swayed with my boyfriend's thrusting cock. The man had pulled down my knickers and was pushing his cock back into my mouth. I sucked him greedily, his balls slapping against my chin. My pussy got wetter just thinking about it.</p> <p>Christian was close. I wondered what was happening to him; I wondered why he hadn't started to unzip his jeans.</p> <p>"Christian!" I cried, reaching out to grab his cock. I wrapped my hand round his shaft and moved my face right up to his. He put his big hands on my shoulders.</p> <p>"Christina! What's your name?" he said as we broke away.</p> <p>He kissed my lips and pushed his cock inside my open mouth. The way it felt against my wet tongue, I felt as if I'd just gone into labour. Christian put his free hand behind my head to pull me onto him, and I let him do it.</p> <p>He started to fuck my mouth again, and I loved it, I loved his big cock, and I felt like I was in my whole life!</p> <p>"This is what he does when I go crazy!" a young, pretty girl had whispered in my ear. "Can I see your breasts?"</p> <p>Christina turned and started to unzip her dress, but the way the man's cock moved inside my mouth, I could not have seen that if I'd wanted to. I was so scared.</p> <p>"Christian, we've got to stop," I whispered in his ear. "This is all wrong!"</p> <p>This was no time though. The man took hold of my head, lifted it onto his cock and thrust his cock right down my throat. I thought I was going to choke.</p> <p>"Christina!"</p> <p>I sucked on the tip of Christian's cock. It wasn't his cock I was sucking, it was the young girl in the room who was doing the sucking. I couldn't concentrate. The sounds around me were getting louder and louder. My hands were balled up in the air, I was so afraid of being caught by somebody's watch, and that's what Christian was doing too. His cock was in and out of my mouth in a smooth motion.</p> <p>"Christina?"</p> <p>Christian started licking my face, and pulling my bangs as far apart as far apart as he could, so as he could, so as I kept sliding them in and the chair. His huge dick and the woman could, so the chair would be, I wasn't. —</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
