So she did that. A moment later, she found herself in Mr. Darcy's arms and kissing the handsome man passionately, which only heightened her lust. Her lips were full, her tongue was agile, and her body was sexy and inviting. She wanted to make love to him: all the way in and all the way out.</p> <p>***</p> <p>They lay together on the bed. Her head nestled on his chest and he was in front of her. She reached under his t-shirt and fondled his balls and cock in her fingers. He put her hand away and pulled down on the waistband of her panties. "May I?"</p> <p>"Yes." Elizabeth nodded. Her panties followed as quickly as they had the night before, revealing her pussy to him. He lowered his face between her legs and kissed her, taking a moment to lick on the lips of her wet pussy. She moaned and spread her legs as he took one into his mouth. At first, he licked her as just the one girl and then as the next, she moaned even louder. He slid her panties off her legs, took it into his mouth, and licked and sucked every drop of her fluid. Once she was naked, he pushed her legs up and kissed the tender skin on either side of her puffy labia, where her lips were hidden.</p> <p>Elizabeth reached her hand between him, found his cock, and guided it into her waiting pussy. It didn't take long for the first one to enter her. She groaned as she felt the length of Mr. Darcy's long cock penetrate her body, then as he slid halfway inside her. The feeling of being full of Mr. Darcy in her made her feel even more incredible.</p> <p>Suddenly, Mr. Darcy began a slow, long, and powerful thrusting. With each thrust, he would come deeper, and he wouldn't stop until he was fully inside her pussy. Elizabeth moaned at the feeling of being filled and penetrated by such a long cock. He could feel her pussy clutching on it, and he couldn't breathe on it. Soon, he was taking her up and down the length of his shaft. He felt like a man possessed, and this feeling of being possessed by a stranger felt so good. His tongue on her pussy felt so good, as did his fingers inside her pussy. His balls felt so full, and the thought of giving her pleasure with this man she had only known for less than four hours, but which was soon to be her entire life, made her want him all the more. "Mr...do...do it...!" She moaned when her orgasm caught hold and she began to shudder as her pussy spasmed around his cock.</p> <p>As she recovered, he got off her body and lay on the bed beside. As he was looking at her beautiful eyes, she looked around the room as if afraid someone might have walked in on them. She turned to look at him too, and saw that he wasn't exactly nervous about what they were about to do. She watched as he began to kiss her and caress her body. As soon as he began to kiss her neck, she closed her eyes and took the first kiss even as she felt his cock sliding in and out of her pussy.</p> <p>"Please, Mr. Darcy," she whispered, "don't stop." The sensations on her vagina were too much to resist, and she quickly found herself spreading her legs as far apart as possible to try to get better access. "Can I have you inside me now, Mr. Darcy?" she whispered and looked up into his eyes. There was a sparkle there, and he saw it. "What will you do if I don't," she smiled as soon as her lips parted for him.</p> <p>Elizabeth's eyes went wide, and she reached down to feel his cock once again. This time she was able to take the long, thick cock into her, and she gasped. "Oh... oh... yes!" She had never taken so much of Mr. Darcy inside her. His long cock was the most wonderful thing she had ever felt in her mind, and it was better than she had ever imagined it being. She closed her eyes and looked deeply into his eyes. She put her hand on the back of his head, feeling the warm and gentle hair, and she held him there a while. The feeling of him inside her was heavenly and she felt so connected to him. She didn't want the experience to end, but she knew it had to. He was the one who did all the work now. "I love you, Mr. Darcy." She finally whispered.</p> <p>"I love you too, as much as the feel we do." He replied.<</p> <p></p> <p>The sensation was so they kissed. "It was perfect.</p> <p>They held them embraced once more kisses became more passionateâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
