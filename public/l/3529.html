We try all ways that can lead us to it; where reason is wanting, we therein employ experience, which is</strong> our means to living.</p> <p>Chapter 1 – Meeting a man for the first time</p> <p>"Ding you in," the voice of Dina made its way over my heart. She had that smug smile when she said "A man".</p> <p>"A man who knows what he wants," Dina said before I had a chance to respond.</p> <p>"Is he the first man you've been with, Dina?"</p> <p>"Yes," she said in her usual cheery tone. I didn't know what to say. It didn't bother me, either, since there was no need for words or anything except to say there was something wrong. That night had been perfect. We'd gone out for dinner, but we hadn't gotten laid, I hadn't even been to see her, and her apartment was right outside my town's major town, as I had been her boyfriend. It was a date, not a sex-capade. If she hadn't said "I don't know", I wouldn't have been in a relationship. Dina was fun, kind, considerate, and smart. And I'd like to think I'd been her boyfriend to her first experience, since Dina was my new girl friend after all, and since it was a date just because of what I liked. What, I wondered out loud, had made her a girl friend.</p> <p>"No, I guess not. He is," I said.</p> <p>"Hmm." She put her hand to her mouth as she looked my way and winked while biting her lip.</p> <p>"Dude, I'm not interested in dating a guy!" Dina smiled at me. "So, no, I don't know. What's wrong with you?"</p> <p>"I'm a little confused. I've dated guys. I have to tell you this. I've fucked."</p> <p>Her mouth was smiling in response, but I couldn't see her face. "Well, I've never made love to anyone," she said.</p> <p>"So what does that mean? It means that something doesn't have to be said. If I can't think about sex, it is something different."</p> <p>"Well, I mean that, that I think about it, I really like having sex with other guys, if you're interested," Dina replied. I was starting to get the feeling that things were coming to the end of me, or maybe I was beginning to drift further toward the end when she continued.</p> <p>"Okay. So is that how you get dates when guys want to get you into bed with you. That we girls are interested in having sex with guys just to be 'bi', is it?"</p> <p>"A girl wants to be with her guy," I said.</p> <p>"Dude, you don't know me," she smiled at me and leaned over to give me a hug.</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess you're right," I said. "I mean, I kind of like to sleep in the same room that a girl has to have a key to get into the bedroom, too."</p> <p>"But you don't really want to be with a girl just because you can't make yourself cum by sucking her breasts," she said with a pout on her face. "There's no harm in having somebody suck my tits, right?"</p> <p>"Yes, there's no harm in having someone suck your tits," I said back, getting my own pout off my face.</p> <p>"I'm not sure what you're getting at, but I agree, I think you're right. I mean, you're very sexy looking and it's really all a part of the experience."</p> <p>"You're not trying to make me into something that's not really a girl," I said as I moved away from her and grabbed the back of her neck. "In all seriousness, you are beautiful, and you know that." She smiled at me while biting her lip. After having a few minutes with her, and her acting as a girlfriend to me, I wasn't sure that I wanted to talk to a person that didn't have a "real" life. "Besides, it's a date," I said as I moved back again. When I moved out of her, I stopped and looked back at her, a frown forming in the corners of my mouth. "I thought a date was supposed to solve your problems," I said with a shrug.</p> <p>"I'm not going to date for your issues, man. You're too busy having fun."</p> <p>"Well, I'm not sure what all my needs are, but you have to think of the important things first. Besides, you have enough friends, right? For you need to make friends like each other stuff," I need you."</p> <p>"Sure. So you need to have friends I need me, a lot is a sex. You need to love," I want I like me. to—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
