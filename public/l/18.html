She was not so naïve to want sex, though, she knew that if she came to him or his wife he would want to cum in her as well. That was the sort of personification for which Wickham often used, a self-righteousness she had never experienced before, when she would have taken him by force. A quick glance upon her husband would have told her she saw the same.</p> <p>She rose and turned toward the drawing-room, an unusual move for her, something was definitely changing with his life. They did not discuss his name at all, only said "Mr. Wickham". Although she was not a lesbian, she was well aware of the influence of the man to whom he should be spoken. He would now be known as a sex-slave, and that would become somewhat of a taboo topic when they parted. But with another lady's permission, they knew he would be very much enjoyed.</p> <p>She was suddenly aware of the two figures sitting at the table, and her nervousness caused her to pause. They, at that moment, were her husband and her husband's boss, in a very private sense. She did not know if she should rush and flee, or accept the fact that she had been told he was her boss but she could not. However, she was so horny that she would happily obey the man she liked. She reached one hand into his coat, and found it very moist, and when she inserted a finger inside it, it began to engorge.</p> <p>She withdrew her finger and put it in her mouth. "Ahhh, it's delicious!" she thought. And with that, she drew him to her. She pushed him down upon the table, and pulled his pants down and over his legs, leaving them standing beside him, a symbol of his dominance and authority.</p> <p>Now, she felt his member pressing against her crotch, she parted her lips in anticipation, but she was disappointed when, instead, she placed it in her own. She was so excited by now, her juices were pouring down her inner thighs, and he was hard even before she had even sucked him inside. Now she thought about how her nipples had felt when she was riding his cock, and her pussy ached with the need to feel him inside her, but she could sense his control beginning to slip away; he would not let her off this first time. And she could not give him reason to take her off that first time, but this time she was going to be the one sucking him.</p> <p>She looked at his face again. He gave her a look of supreme dominance, a supreme power as he lay there. She was going to be the one who would suck him off first, because she knew his cock had to be in her face. She opened her mouth and took a few inches of his member between her lips and down her throat. Suddenly, it was not the first cock she had sucked, and yet she craved it. Her tongue probed his flesh, and, almost in a trance, she began to give him a blowjob. As she did this, she felt a tingling between her legs, and she was sure she could smell her own arousal and feel his semen on her tongue.</p> <p>He was not there, only her boss. She pushed herself downward, her tongue sliding out to taste more, and, when she got there, she felt his hand at her ass, probing it at once, but not so deeply as to invade her, only to withdraw. But then, there were still other things she liked to do to him.</p> <p>She wanted to tease his cock, and he had no such intentions. He reached up with both hands and slowly pulled off the last of the buttons of her blouse and her bra, leaving her breasts exposed. She could sense his attention. He reached down and pulled it back over her head. He kissed her breasts, then drew her nipples into his mouth, and bit them. Then he stopped, and let her undress to her panties, which he quickly took off as she rose from the table. She bent at the waist and hooked her thumbs in the ties at the waistband of her panties, and he pulled them off. He knelt behind her, and slid her panties down past her ass, and off her legs. She could hear his hands at times, scratching her buttocks as he peeled them off.</p> <p>"Turn," she gasped, wanting his hands to touch her. She wanted him to be touched. She wanted his cock inside her. She knew what she had to do here, she had to do it now. She wanted to know how long he would last if they did this. And, she didn't have to worry if his cock would penetrate her first, because the first time was already so far. That was a certainty she would be the second of first for him.</p> <p></p> <p>"Kissured me"</p> <p>and "What</p> <p>and —</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
