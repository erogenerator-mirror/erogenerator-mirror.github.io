So live as indifferent to the world and all worldly objects, as</h4><p><strong>one who liveth by himself alone upon some desert hill. For whether here, or there, if the whole world be but as one town, it matters not much for the</strong> world, even though for the planet it would probably be different. The earth still was a hot and humid desert landscape, and though the sun had no place to rise in the mountains of the Sahara or in the desert of the north-east far west, where they live, it is the desert where one can fuck as long as one likes.</p> <p>I used to believe in that. That's the whole story anyway, but in today, we're just a few miles away from the desert, somewhere on the north coast of America, where the sun is setting, the sun is looking right, so that makes sex the whole world. It's not that I'm a virgin, because I'm not. I've got a lot of experience being with men and women, and I'm sure the world will find it much easier, since I have experience to boot. It's also interesting to me a little, because I've done a lot of things this way, just like having a cock in my cunt before I've done something really nasty. For example, I've even had a little, and only now have I actually had a cock in my mouth, although, to me, I'm still rather good at that.</p> <p>What I don't know is that the world that makes me so fucking horny does much more than being in the movies, or what makes the difference in fact, the more you can look at the world of sex. I love sex, in the context of the action of having sex, whether on a big bed or a sofa, or on some sofa seat, or in some movie booth. I love the look of the world in a movie, while watching one, and not just the movie but the very moment you look at that movie. You can also look at the world of sex, while watching another movie, or read a book, while you smoke a joint, or play cards, or take a bath. You can enjoy it even more than watching those movies.</p> <p>My world is not just sex, but the whole world.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>You can't read all this stuff until you've had the chance. That's how it is with the rest of us.</p> <p>I read the stories in the first chapter. The next chapter will be in a different chapter, but I've added a few comments to make you even more curious about this genre. Thanks.</p> <p>Comments welcomeâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
