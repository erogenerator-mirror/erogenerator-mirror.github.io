It was perhaps</strong> the greatest time of our lives] (A.H.)</p> <p>THE BOLO-ROPE</p> <p>A dance to begin the day</p> <p>A romantic evening in Paris</p> <p>The city of Louvre</p> <p>Dearly</p> <p>Saturday.</p> <p>A young American at Louvre and their romantic dinner.</p> <p>It was a romantic evening. It was a dinner. It was a romantic evening. It was a nice romantic dinner. It was a romantic dinner. It was a romantic dinner. It was romantic supper. It was romantic restaurant after dinner. It was romantic dining in a nice restaurant, but it also was romantic restaurant at the most romantic place in the world. The food, the romantic food. The romantic restaurant. The perfect table. The perfect setting. The perfect time to dress as sexy women when there was a romantic date, but not here in a romantic city. Even if it was not at the restaurant, it at the most romantic restaurant in the world.</p> <p>It was a romantic dinner. It was a romantic dinner. It was a romantic date. It was romantic dinner. It was romantic dinner. It was romantic dinner. It was romantic. It was romantic. It was romantic. It was romantic. It was romantic. It was romantic. This was Paris. This was Cherys and Milla. This was the life to be held at Louvre. Paris is a beautiful city. Paris is a lovely city. Paris is the City of love, love and companionship. Paris is the city of love. Paris is the center of sin. Paris is the City of Lust. Paris is the City of Lust, sin. Paris is the City of Lust, lust. Paris is the City of Lust. It is the most beautiful city in the world. Paris is the city of love, sin. Paris is the most beautiful city in the world. Paris is the City of Lust. It has been Paris for many years. Paris is as Paris always is.</p> <p>This was the most romantic date. This was romantic dinner. This was romantic dinner. This was romantic. The restaurant was as romantic as ever. The restaurant was as romantic as ever. The romantic dinner was romantic. This was romantic. There were a hostess and a waitress to be found at the table. There were people there. There were servers. There were Maidens and servants. Everyone was there. There were Maidens and Serves. It was as romantic as ever. The people looked as they always did. The musicians had a wonderful sound system and all the tables and chairs had a romantic sound system. I'm sure there were people at the table.</p> <p>As I was taking my turn and dancing with my girlfriends, a woman in her 40's and a very attractive young American lady, who was very elegantly dressed, sat near me. I found the young American girl very sexy. She had long red hair and dark eyes that were sparkling. She also had the body of an athlete. She had medium length, thick, longish hair. I'm sure, as she danced with her, she had a very impressive body. She had a very impressive figure. I knew that many people at their homes were just sexually attracted to women in their beds sometimes. But, they would never say that about them, at least not about us. We're all sexually interested in men and women but we are not looking for a romantic meal. We're looking for a romantic meal. We're looking for a romantic dinner in a romantic restaurant.</p> <p>The young girl was my girlfriend. I couldn't believe it. We were friends, but we weren't good friends. We were lovers. We were lovers. We are good friends. We are not good friends. But, I found the young girl very desirable. I also found her lovely, sexy body very appealing. I also found her very sexy and sexy. This young woman was not the prettier of her girlfriends or the prettier of girls but the fact that she was as pretty as she was desirable. She was very sensual and attractive. My girlfriend. I also found her irresistible. I had fallen deeply within my romantic date and her. I was falling deeply within my romantic date.</p> <p>My girlfriend of 15 years, she introduced herself as 'Sarita,' a very beautiful French woman, in her fifties, with medium length and thick hair, dark brown eyes, a beautiful face and a smile that lit her eyes, beautiful teeth and a set of full lips that were full and lush. I found her quite desirable indeed as well. My girlfriend of the past 15 years, a woman who was very attractive, especially sexy at her age and especially desirable at 18, an 18 year older with a perfect body I didn't see the beauty at that is at her age, that her age but she's in her best, I still look her age and not in her age but I still and she's beautiful and her for a very young she's her, the most perfect look.
