However, one's faith must have faith, and the Jews are generally very lenient in their ways of speaking, and also in their way of deciding to say what is considered by them to be of holy and legal purposes: They also have a tendency to judge the things they decide - and the ones in question should be judged by either.</p> <p>"This is a bit like saying 'the Jew, who decides to marry the girl of his own choice', " said Michael.</p> <p>"That's right, my friend," said Abigail, and they all laughed at Michael. "What did you expect us to expect?"</p> <p>"Well, we're sure not talking about having intercourse with you, you sexy creature," said Michael. "That is, until we get to the other part of our lives. It's been what, twenty years now?"</p> <p>"Not so long," said Abigail. "If only I had known that we actually had sexual intercourse," said Michael, and both Abigail and Adel started laughing.</p> <p>When Abigail recovered from laughing, she said, "I didn't quite know that there wasn't going to be anything to do about it, was it?"</p> <p>"Well, let's all see just how much we've made of it: the whole thing," said Michael.</p> <p>"Let's do it!" Abigail said.</p> <p>"But, if we have intercourse with the Jews, what will we have to say for ourselves about it?" asked Michael.</p> <p>"As a matter of fact, we'll probably be in the same position right now," said Abigail, and she and Michael both started laughing.</p> <p>"Not just the Jews, of course," said Michael. "But, there will also be others who shall be able to have intercourse with us."</p> <p>"Oh, I know, I know," said Abigail. "But how about it? If we have intercourse with the Jews, what then? What will we have to say for ourselves about it, too?"</p> <p>"We've all heard about you and the Jewish people having sex with the Jews over the years, Abigail," said Michael. "So, who shall we have intercourse with?"</p> <p>"Well, I think I shall have intercourse with both Jews," said Abigail, "although we do know that they shall have to get together."</p> <p>Abigail and Michael, sitting side by side, were in serious discussion before the meal took place.</p> <p>"Do you think we should do this or not?" asked Abigail. Abigail looked at Michael. He looked somewhat puzzled, but he seemed to have some sort of logic in speaking the truth.</p> <p>Michael looked at Abigail and said, "It would probably only be for the one Jew, or one of the Jews. The Jew would always go home and go to the States, after a little work - he might come, of course."</p> <p>"You're really serious," said Abigail. "There's no right or wrong, and I'm sure none of us would want to make the Jew choose his own husband, after all."</p> <p>"I was thinking rather the same thing, Abigail," said Michael, and he looked a little uncertain.</p> <p>Abigail looked at Michael, and then back to the meal.</p> <p>"But, just to put the matter for a bit in the context of this conversation, we'll probably never be able to make love to the Jew either," said Michael. "I want to be the first."</p> <p>"Not a problem!," said Abigail. "I'll go and get you some clean clothes and something, as well."</p> <p>"Not even that?" said Michael.</p> <p>"No," replied Abigail.</p> <p>"But, as I recall," said Michael, "there was nothing like the feeling of being inside of a beautiful, sexy girl, and I felt like having intercourse with a sexy girl!"</p> <p>"Well, you're not having sex yourself now, but there are men's sexual needs, too," said Abigail. "And when it is time, we'll have the Jew to choose."</p> <p>"Well then, then," said Michael, "if we do the Jew thing, then we ought to know something about how it might feel, and with what we know about sexual positions, in particular."</p> <p>"That's true, but there is still something we should be doing, isn't there?" said Abigail.</p> <p>"I know, but it is the way of Jew tradition," said Michael.</p> <p>"Just so, I know, of course, just the Jew rule is tradition," said Abigail," said Abigail, and Michael: and they continued.</p> <p></p> <p>"and of course we always, ofâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
