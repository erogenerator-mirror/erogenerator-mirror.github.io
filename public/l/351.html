Neither cared to begin talking. Pierre continually glanced at Prince Andrew; Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead with his small hand. “Let us go and have supper,”</strong> was Andrew. “Let’s get dressed and go find your wife again,” was Andrew’s suggestion.</p> <p>“It’s okay, I’ll call her as soon as I get dressed and get out of sight,” Prince Andrew replied.</p> <p>“Let me call her,” Andrew continued to rub his crotch as Prince Andrew’s hand found the hole in his slacks and slid in through.</p> <p>“Let’s go,” Andrew responded.</p> <p>In less than 20 minutes they were waiting for their car to arrive. As soon as prince Andrew got in Prince Andrew’s hand closed her front door and followed her to a motel, not too far from the university. Andrew held her arm as he unlocked the door. They entered the room and Princess Pierre got a room ready as well, leaving just a single room available at the hotel for them, plus a queen size bed in case their spouses slept it off or they wanted to get up early after a long day. Prince Andrew got into a chair near the door and told the princess that if she wanted to use his room as long as they got dressed, they would. She said sure, but didn’t leave the room.</p> <p>A minute later, prince Andrew had a nice view of Pierre’s tits as they undressed and they kissed as they slipped out of gowns. Prince Andrew pulled her to him and their mouths met as they sucked on each other’s tongues. They both stripped off their robes and stood kissing as they pressed their naked bodies together. Prince Andrew pushed his tongue into her mouth and kissed her deeper still. They broke the kiss and she gasped at the size of his cock. She wrapped her arms around his big muscular body and he pushed the softness of her body against his erection. She moaned with passion against his lips.</p> <p>Prince Andrew and Princess Pierre had to be naked when they met at Prince’s hotel. They didn’t rush though, as they quickly followed their dress clothes to the bed. They kissed again as they got on the bed. They held each other’s naked bodies and explored each other’s faces and mouths until both lost control. Their kissing turned into a frantic fuck session. One of them grabbed their heads and held them hard against each other. As their breathing became more raspy, they pulled apart and looked into each other’s eyes. Prince Andrew said, “It doesn’t feel like her fucking anymore does it?”</p> <p>“I haven’t had it like that in a long time. The sex is just wonderful,” was Pierre’s reply.</p> <p>“Did we cum together?” Prince Andrew asked Pierre.</p> <p>“Do you feel it,” Pierre said.</p> <p>“I'm too heavy to feel anything,” Prince Andrew replied.</p> <p>“We need to get the condoms,” Pierre said, standing up and grabbing a condom from the bag. He opened the door to the room just as a car approached them. As he opened the door and Prince Andrew got in the backseat. The driver honked his horn as Princess Pierre closed her door.</p> <p>“I’ve gotta wait for her,” Pierre said. “This is too long.”</p> <p>As Prince Andrew and Princess Pierre drove their way, they looked into each other’s eyes. Their expressions were all a blur as they stared at each other. Pierre took charge and put his arm on Pierre’s slim waist. He pulled Pierre into him and kissed the smaller man passionately. Pierre pulled his mouth away and kissed Prince Andrew again. Then Pierre pushed him back on the bed and they continued to kiss as they rolled Pierre against the backseat. Pierre was on his back now and Pierre crawled over his chest and belly to kiss Pierre’s nipples through his shirt and his shirt. As Pierre watched as Princess Pierre sucked on Prince Andrew’s nipples, they rolled together and they had their first kiss. As they kissed they kissed deeply as each lover’s cock was buried inside the other.</p> <p>They were kissing when the car began its drive back towards the hotel. They stared in each other’s eyes as they continued to kiss and suck on the other. Pierre couldn’t take much more of their kissing and touching. He needed to fuck Princess Pierre while she licked his nipple. Prince Andrew took Pierre over to their room and pulled him inside. While Prince Andrew and they kissed, Pierre went across the entire length of each other side of the foot and of the bed they kissed. They fucked, sucking on the bed. Pierre, and to the bed and for quite long slow long time. Eventually Pierre was long times. Every kiss on Pierre’s Pierre was Pierre’s until Pierre did they—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
