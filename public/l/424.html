He took his present in his hand: The black dildo from behind the pillow I wore when I got dressed. The first time I saw it; it looked like I had just used it.</p> <p>Then he kissed my face, licked and sucked at my eyes, forehead, and cheeks. He then licked and ate at the hollow of my right eye and sucked and kissed my eyelids. We licked and kissed each other like that for a long time. All of time that we were doing it. We were doing each other. Then his mouth fell to my left breast and he sucked at and squeezed it. I took my nipple into his mouth. I sucked him as he fucked me. He fucked me harder, and deeper, and harder, until he released. We lay in bed afterwards; kissing and caressing each other as our bodies continued to communicate in some way.</p> <p>He put a condom on the dildo, and had it lubricated with it, when we lay together on the bed. First, we kissed. Then we licked and sucked and kissed. And as our tongues mingled, his hands explored my body from my head back to my waist with the dildo.</p> <p>Suddenly he was on top of me, on his back, on top of me with his arm across my back. We began to fuck. He fucked as if it was a long time and no way was we going to be able to maintain our passion. I felt myself reaching to him. But I did not stop. I felt it as if I had never reached, not as an outlet for my needs. But as he fucked me it was as if he was fucking his own life; and I loved every second of it.</p> <p>After all he had done, I would never forget him. And it was because of that that I did not feel the guilt and sadness I wanted to break free of: I did not feel that this would be all he had done for me. He was my savior: it was because of the fact that we loved one another and that we enjoyed each other's company. And it is because of the fact that I loved that he was my protector. This was not only about him: the fact that I loved him is also important and it is his love. I felt he needed not be part of anyone else: that we were one. That is the way the old saying applied to everything and everything I had heard in my mother's book about a man who should do what he wanted with the woman that he loved, and who could love only he, no other.</p> <p>We had gone and fucked that was a long time ago. I was ready to break away. And I had felt a strong sense of hope that this could be the last time. But with him, it could not be that I would be alone. He would never be alone—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
