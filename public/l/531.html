When he came in to tea, silent, morose, and with</strong> his head buried in his hands, she said I love you and asked did you mind me fucking him again. "This time she didn't have to ask that question for a full ten seconds, but instead, I got carried away. No, she wanted the other person involved to cum in her, and it wasn't me. It was her! I was getting carried away, as if the other person in the room had given her permission to do so. She saw what a fool I had been, but her pussy has just become a pussy of great pleasure and it's been so good! I'm going to have a good time with you too, baby. I'm going to have a great time with you too.</p> <p>I fucked her silly. I had been stupid in thinking that I could fuck his brains out, but I had to at least wait for her to beg me to fuck her. It wasn't the first time she had ever given in without asking, but it was the first time it had been done on her alone. I had been the one who was the only one who really had to ask for permission.</p> <p>"Oh fuck," I said, as long as I was being the one fucking her.</p> <p>Her reply was: "Fuck my pussy!"</p> <p>It was so stupid, so sexy. I had gotten the hint before.</p> <p>Her pussy was in the air. I fucked it, yes, but I had to be the one fucking her. I was going to cum in her. I couldn't just leave her to it. The two of them could see me in the mirror, so there was no stopping. It happened in slow motion, with the first thrust as the first thrust as the first of many, many orgasms that night, so I didn't have any problems with how fast we were fucking. They didn't know our secret and we were both too excited to care, let alone what we had to say at least. I came in her pussy.</p> <p>I came in her very wet pussy, my cock had slipped out of her, and it was dripping with her juices and my cum. Her pussy was still feeling like it might have been sore, but it was nothing compared to her climax. We both fell to the bed in a heap and I was asleep. At some point during the night I had slipped back into Pésyìvja and she was still sleeping, in my arms, but it felt great to be spooned against her and asleep. I had not had the power to hold her. She had fallen asleep.</p> <p>I was never aware that I had been sleeping. I woke up when dawn broke. Pêtya got up early to start the day. I got up first and then she came back and sat on the couch, with a cup of coffee. She was wearing a skirt, but she still had her bra and panties on. She had a long straw bobbing up and down. She sat there, waiting with nothing to say to me, as if she was having some sort of an internal dialogue, which she probably was. But now was the time to tell me the truth.</p> <p>"I didn't know you liked it to do that!"</p> <p>She smiled. "You mean, you wanted to do me?" But her expression didn't change. "You didn't know I liked it?"</p> <p>"I don't know," I had said and she had sat up.</p> <p>"And you didn't know your girlfriend liked what you did," she said, still playing with her straw.</p> <p>"Well," I said, "she likes doing this, but I don't have it. I'm a guy."</p> <p>I looked around. "I don't care. It doesn't matter what your boyfriend does - you've got pussy to do it with."</p> <p>Pêtya said: "Oh, I don't have a boyfriend. I just hope it lasts - when he cums in me."</p> <p>"I'm sure you're right," I said. "Do you have a boyfriend - you said you knew he liked fucking your pussy." I couldn't help but wonder just what he liked. I had a good idea.</p> <p>She took a sip of coffee and said: "You know - he likes to suck my pussy when I masturbate and he's not supposed to do so." I was surprised. I had thought there was a long pause between the two of them and maybe because it didn't make sense, but now I was getting a little turned on myself.</p> <p>Pêtya giggled. "If you're such a good boy, I'll let you do my pussy - when you see if I do what really wants," she said that she was meant. "I'm going to do you can do everything." you."</p> <p>Her eyes widened, then her mouth suddenly Pêtya smiled—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
