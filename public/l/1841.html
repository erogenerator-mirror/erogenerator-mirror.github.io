To these ever-present helps and mementoes, let one more be added,</h4><p><strong>ever to make a particular description and delineation as it were of every object that presents itself to thy mind, that thou mayest wholly and throughly contemplate it, in its</strong> fullest beauty.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Part 21 : What can thou, thee, do for these things which thou so well know thou?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I was feeling incredibly horny, almost, as my lover and I kissed passionately. My hands had been caressed and fondled and our lips had come together in a most delightful kiss. I slid my body down and knelt between his legs, my arms and hands slowly following his left leg as it reached to the floor. My long hair fell around me as I kissed his body, my face nuzzling, kissing and hugging him everywhere. I could taste his sweat and a slight sour-ol-like taste on his cock, his manhood. The taste was familiar; a little mouth-to-nose from all that has passed in our lives in a brief time, a mouth-to-nose from the past. But here it was, a face, a lovely face that drew me close at once.</p> <p>My hands came up and under his cheeks as they embraced and we kissed again. I put the tip of my tongue just at his mouth before letting him push it in, as his tongue was as eagerly probing into my mouth as mine was into the tip of his tongue. Soon, one of my hands was sliding under from its base onto his cock. His fingers found my cunt from just below, it and I came up at once together, my finger finding what it sought and finding it.</p> <p>Part 22 : Take him from both holes!</p> <p>Part 23 : We want to make him ready for me.</p> <p>Part 24 : It will take me a few months to get him ready enough for me.</p> <p></p> <p>Part 28 : It will take me quite a while for him to fuck a woman!</p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 41 - The next</p> <p>The week passed by, we explored with each other, and we found that we both wanted to make sure everything had been planned. I could now understand why. For me now, his need to experience the joys of a woman was always something he truly enjoyed, even if there was something, something that only seemed to be possible in lovemaking. And it was definitely not the first person who came into my mind.</p> <p>On the way home from the office with the exception of the trip to my favorite restaurant, I went home to the usual small apartment which was in the same neighborhood I lived in when I moved into my new hotel on the other hand. And on the drive back, where a little over a week's delay would give us a little bit more time to get to know one another and to do some sightseeing, I decided to get out of town. Just the opposite of where I knew I would be if not for my partner, my lover and my love for him the last few weeks. However, if I made the wrong choice in getting a man who loved me as much as I did to him, I would be going away for a little while as well.</p> <p>The day came and I took the car to the grocery store. I found it was a little after four, even before I had bought the bag for the first day. I bought some lunch, a vegetable soup that I was glad to make, and the usual snacks I enjoyed, along with two bottles of excellent wine. Then, I went to shower and dress in my pajamas, which were still a little full, even though I had just ordered the meal for lunch, and went downstairs to sit on my own terrace, the wine and the vegetables on the counter. I was thinking about our last moments here together, of our love, or perhaps the love of the last few weeks. As I looked at the time, I thought back to all the people who had made my life difficult and who had been so attentive to me, who had been everything I desired after seeing us together and the joy we had each shown one another and for me, that was even more than just a wonderful time.</p> <p>I also felt that perhaps this may be my chance, my chance of meeting a woman who had the potential to teach me a whole set of things to do for myself. She would be able to teach me to get even better at sex than I was already doing at it. What made all this so possible was the fact that I felt that I could ask permission to do it too, if it would be OK. It was OK with me to ask permission to try to make this possible by being with other people without me giving it to him. But, to be honest, I guess I wanted to make the most of it just now, because I knew how much I wanted to give him the pleasure he so rightly deserved.</p> <p>There were the clothes that I normally wore in that position and there were also some other things I had bought for the whole days. There. I came out a pair of underwear at my purse that I even opened the first night.
