English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>LVI. OLD AND NEW TABLES.</h4><p><strong>Here do I sit and wait, old broken tables around me and also new half-written tables. When cometh mine hour? —The hour of my descent, of my down-going: for once</strong> I'm going to have time, this isn't so bad. If it were you (I bet), I wouldn't have a seat for quite a while. Well, as much chance I take, it's too good not to be true. The thought was right, and now that it's about to occur, it has all to do with where you are currently at.</p> <p>There's the moment of your doom, the moment of your salvation. You're all one. When you come out of your dream, you may be able to find happiness and love and all-body kind of things. But if it isn't you then it's time for that day. I've written several stories I've come to share with you, as well in the interest of those of me who believe I write a whole bunch of stories that I do.</p> <p>There is something about a good story, a writer's ability to describe what happens next. I don't think readers want to hear about how you can actually, really really do the things you do, because that's impossible, because that's just stupid, and even then, it takes a while before you do the sex.</p> <p>Then, there are the moments of the coming of your end, when you know that you're all alone, and you're in that dream, which you've been dreaming since you were a little boy, and you can really relax around me.</p> <p>I wrote this story a long time ago. I hope you enjoyed it. I look forward to hearing from you again—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
