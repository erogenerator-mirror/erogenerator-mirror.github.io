Four several dispositions or inclinations there be of the mind and</h4><p><strong>understanding, which to be aware of, thou must carefully observe: and whensoever thou doest discover them, thou must rectify them, saying to thyself concerning every one of them, This imagination</strong>, which thou may well be privy to, is not your fault. Thus you were ready to make love before thou entered the dark pit of your own mind. And so you must ask to partake, so thou may discover them, to feel them, to know, thou must be aware of them.</p> <p>Chapter 7.</p> <p>Eggs.</p> <p>A baby is a big part of life! Even if you have never heard of it, if you know of the word, "baby", how is a newborn child conceived? Well, how is a newborn child conceived by a woman who is pregnant, to which you also have never heard the term "born" but, if that is what you thought you were experiencing - there is a fine fine line between pregnancy and death!</p> <p>Eggs.</p> <p>Yes, so much of it, as well as many that you must learn. It's all about birth. You should know that it, too, is about reproduction. The male has a penis that is three times its normal length and girth, which is about twice as long as the female's. You might find this a problem as you've heard. The male might get very excited when he takes his penis out, because it might be a sign of female readiness but, in most cases, it is a sign of manhood. In fact, to give you the correct description of this man's penis, you should examine it - and, even after seeing it, find the whole thing is quite a bit shorter than normal.</p> <p>So, on the other hand - how does life really work?</p> <p>How about now? So what?</p> <p>Have you had your chance to take a look into the mirror? And how much do you like this!</p> <p>Have you examined yourself for the first time? I'm curious to see what it feels like to have a man's penis in your mouth! - it was really quite something for me when you had your period and you could have been a little pregnant! - I'm very curious to see your hymen. (I hope no one says to their mates that if your hymen gets broken you must break it)</p> <p>What kind of man do you think I would be? Does it matter to you whether you're a father, mother, a brother, a sister, a lover, a stranger, to which you are not aware, what makes you your partner, and, as I have suggested above, whether you are a father, mother, a lover, a father (even if your parents are unknown to you), and/or a lover? If not, then you know that you shouldn't worry. It's not really that important, although, in spite of your curiosity there are still quite some things you like. It's just, of course, that in any case, I think you're an attractive woman.</p> <p>Do you get aroused by the sight of a naked man, perhaps even a man with his penis in your mouth? Or do you find sex pleasurable? Are you attracted to other women and only men? Is it an open-mindedness about your sexual preference or something else? Have you seen naked women with their penises? Have you seen naked women, in private or in public, masturbating, and having intercourse?</p> <p>Have you tasted a woman or a man's semen?</p> <p>"Sperm" doesn't seem so interesting, after all, but I bet we could discuss what you think, at length. If you want to go further, I may know your answer. If you are thinking about giving oral sex to a man, then perhaps I should know if your vagina could do some serious damage to your penis in the case, as I have described. If so, then my dear woman, it is probably unlikely that there should be any difficulty in having intercourse with you.</p> <p>That was, in fact, how I ended our discussion. Perhaps you'd like to have intercourse with me again? I've got a spare razor for when you might wish to shave your pubic hair, just in case!</p> <p>By the way, would you like us to go to the toilet? Or do you want to sit down? You know, you do the toilet in the next bedroom, the toilet at the far end, perhaps! And if its not possible to pee standing, then maybe it isn't the time and the place to carry on with intercourse! I've got an erection myself so if you're not interested in doing the toilet - the first thing either of us should do is have a pee.</p> <p>I'll take you to the toilet and tell you to go to it. It's in the kitchen where you should have a glass of water whilst we pee (and not too much else); it's just as well known that there are men who, in some men have a certain habits of which make themselves. There is quite a manliness in all the way of life, and of life or the way of the heartâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
