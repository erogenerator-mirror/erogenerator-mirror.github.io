Before the depth reached his middle he was halfway over; the current</strong> kept lifting him up. I felt her hand on my lower back, helping guide me.</p> <p>It was an easy process in this position. Each muscle in my body was tensed, and the water only helped loosen it. When her hand went back to my ass I felt her squeeze it, and then a little push. I turned slowly in time with the current as it passed, trying to keep my balance. I could almost tell where she was going, and how I was going to get the most out of it. So I pushed against her hand, which came back and rubbed the underside of my buttock as I slid in. At this point I was starting to feel myself getting hard as well. By then I was starting to trust that she wasn't going to back off at any point.</p> <p>I pushed forward in time with the current, and her hand returned to rubbing my lower back. Then I felt her mouth on my right bicep. I looked down to see her lips close around my cock, and then I saw her tongue circle the crown. We had barely made out before her mouth enclosed my tip, and then her hand started to rhythmically massage the base of my shaft. The movement was causing my body to shift in a few places to compensate. That gave me another thrill to be doing this with my wife.</p> <p>And it got better. She had stopped massaging me when my cock started to get a bit slippery. So it was a matter of doing her a favor by sliding her face down the shaft, and then back up again. We'd both gotten a bit worked up so I thought I might cum in the process or I would be embarrassed as this was happening to some unknown member of our family.</p> <p>Instead, she took my dick out of her mouth and started to rub a nipple. The nipple was sensitive, and she had found a way to give it even more pressure. It made me even harder. She rolled the tip around as she continued to stroke. Finally she switched to the base as well. I couldn't help but breathe in between my moan and the feel of her tongue encircling my cock. She kept this up, and I could tell her mouth moving over the tip of my dick. Then she was licking my sack while she squeezed and stroked me. If I wasn't hard before, she was really getting me worked up. A couple strokes up my shaft was enough to start a very nice build-up, and I was already so into it. After a couple of more strokes I let out a sigh that was more of an "oh shit, it feels so fucking good." and I pulled back a little.</p> <p>Finally she moved her head up to kiss me, only to get me to go back down. This time she made it up and went to work. She licked and kissed every inch of me. She sucked on the head with her lips, and licked from the tip all the way down to the base for a while. Then she licked at the bottom as well, and again and again. I was totally focused on this mouth, and knew that she would do things with her tongue that could make me blow my load even without my hands. I pulled her to me and I kissed her. She pulled back and looked down at me. "I love you," she said.</p> <p>I kissed her again, and then I pulled away and got out of the water. Then I moved to one side, and we got out and I had her turn around facing the lake. The water had a slush that felt good as it ran along my cock and balls. I looked down at her as she bent over in front of me, the water sliding over our skin as our naked bodies were inches apart. She was so wet that the bottom of the glass of the shower was wet and shiny and felt great in my hands. Her breasts were bouncing as we moved. I bent over at the waist to get some of the water on my cock, so I could get that wet and slippery up into her mouth and onto her tits. A couple seconds later I felt some pressure on my cock and knew that she was going to take me in her pussy.</p> <p>She took me with long strokes, from my balls to the tip, and it was very enjoyable. Then she started to use her hands, pulling my ass with them. It was a very erotic sensation. I thought I was going to burst. Then she said, just once, to get me hard and hard and hard like this, and fuck me. She turned around and I sat down on the seat in the shower. Then she bent over again to lick me and that felt incredible. I was ready to blow, but I was in ecstasy, too. She grabbed me and led me to her and rubbed me, and got me harder and went back to her then she and I was on in that same position again. She started to do me and I went again, and again andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
