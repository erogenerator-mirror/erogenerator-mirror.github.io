But no sooner had Natásha finished her barcarolle than reality again presented itself. He</strong> smiled to himself and she smiled back to him.</p> <p>"Ah! Yes! It feels like something's wrong with me, too! It feels like my body is having sex with itself, but its pleasure is in front of my mind too! And it's like our bodies are fucking!"</p> <p>They smiled at each other and Natásha's heart sped to an excited frenzy in her chest. For a moment, they stared at the ceiling and Natásha thought about moving, but she did not want to leave the warm feelings of euphoria which they had been experiencing and the fact that she was about to climax.</p> <p>Instead, she kissed his lips and he kissed her back. Their lips and tongues began playing again, which they were doing in earnest, now. It was not long until Natásha was almost at the breaking point. She grabbed his shoulders and rolled him onto his back, then crawled up until her thighs were over his, which made her pussy just touch the head of his penis.</p> <p>"Please don't. Ah, don't stop."</p> <p>But her tone was like ice water in an explosion of pain. That was all it took for her to climax, which only intensified his already heightened state.</p> <p>And it was only after Natásha had finished ejaculating and his own lust had receded to a manageable level that the reality of her statement sank in. He felt her pussy tighten on his penis. It was not his own lust to feel that way, but his, too - a feeling he had never experienced in the past and he was feeling with her now. They were so familiar, so familiar!</p> <p>"Oh! Yes! Yes! You feel so good! Oh, yes! This feels so wonderful! Oh! Yes! Yes!" she moaned.</p> <p>And her muscles convulsed on his cock over and over again. He enjoyed every stroke and every second of Natásha's performance.</p> <p>"Oh! Yes! Don't stop! Oh, yes! That's so wonderful! Ah!"</p> <p>Natásha was still recovering when her eyes met Hers and she gazed like a deer caught in the headlights. He could tell that she was lost in ecstasy and her facial expressions matched the way her pussy seemed to throb.</p> <p>She kissed him once again, then she was all over his chest while slowly stroking his penis again with her pussy.</p> <p>"Let me know when you're ready," she purred and went off on her own trip to Nirvana and was gone, leaving both of them panting after their intense pleasure.</p> <p>They both got up to go to the shower and both laughed in unison when they did, and then Natásha lay on the bed as usual and sighed in contentment. She began to play with herself.</p> <p>"What's so funny?" he asked.</p> <p>"Nothing. But I was just looking at how my body felt and wondered what it would feel like to have a man's penis inside me."</p> <p>"Me too. Oh, do you know what I've thought about that? About my orgasm. When my penis is in my vagina it feels like a tight, wet, warm mass. It feels sexy. It feels like I can't get enough of it. It's like I can't get enough of it. You really feel like a woman now?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>His erection was growing and Natásha's pussy got wetter and then it was full of sperm again. She lay on her side, with her arms around his neck, breathing heavily while he caressed her back, her breasts over his hand, her butt, her face over his shoulder. They kissed again and started caressing each others faces.</p> <p>"I loved that. It made me feel totally loved. How could anything else ever feel that good," she murmured.</p> <p>"Me too, except when I know you are ready to cum," he added.</p> <p>"That's okay. I feel so free and relaxed."</p> <p>"I feel that way too - just thinking back makes me feel like a woman with the love of a man. Your penis feels so good and I feel like I want to feel like one."</p> <p>"I can feel that way," she agreed. "But let me know how ready you are or how often you're ready."</p> <p>"Whenever you're ready and how you're ready."</p> <p>Natásha kissed him again. She got him again. And when she felt his excitement build and get harder she moved her hips slowly and very deliberately, sliding her body on his. She wanted him to feel so alive and not just her own. She wanted it. It was very real now. And she had to do whatever she could never forget.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Nat'sShe did not just do It for she wanted—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
