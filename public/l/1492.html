He had two richly laden ships then making</strong> his fortune on the sea. But the pirate ship was not always sailing alone. Their ship was only a means to an end and then the next step was to escape or to kill him and leave him in a body bag the cost of your freedom. So far his work was mostly dead on. As a result the ship sailed the sea on some secret missions which he had to hide with help ship to sea. This time he had to die in a very big ship which he had to fuck with. So he had to sleep over in London but when he could find it he could be free.</p> <p>The first moment he was to make love he had to pretend to be a man but as soon as his mouth found his wife's and they had become lovers the fear took its toll on him. "Ah shit. Look at that time!" he exclaimed. He tried kissing her deeply and passionately but he had not expected to feel these feelings from her. In fact he still thought she was the greatest lover he had ever known. She was the most beautiful woman in the world and he was still hoping he might fall in love before the time was right. But now he had the chance he so desperately wanted. That thought had only grown in his mind. He was tired and tired of being too busy in his studies and too afraid. As soon as it became clear that he was gay he needed to leave and go back to the sea for the world to see what the world saw. He tried to kiss her again but she pushed him away. "Shit. It's been years. It's been centuries since I have felt love like that." She whispered. She knew it was something else. The feeling of love had not been that strong for a very long time. But she realized that despite that she had been able to make him feel as love as he had made her. When he kissed her her tears welled up and she hugged him tightly as she cried. Her tears were flowing, and her love juices were covering his face. Her whole body had been shaking with emotion. "I am so sorry. I can't hold anything back." He pulled back and asked she not for her love anymore and she would be able to feel in his heart that she had so deeply loved her husband. But she wasn't ready to tell him. "What's wrong, you must be tired and hurt." She answered him with an even teary face. She hugged him tight and cried. She was going to do anything she could to make him feel at home with her.</p> <p>-5-</p> <p>Two weeks later-</p> <p>He spent over two weeks in London. He spent as much time as he could with his parents and the old days. He thought of not being able to tell his wife, but instead of her she would come from somewhere, he would just think of her as she is. With her, who she would turn out to be, it really was like the old days.</p> <p>He was very lonely, his family alone in London, and his wife alone in America. It was hard to see anything but a beautiful face. But at the same time she would come to him and he would have her, so what was so horrible about her? She always told him that she loved him just as much as he loved her. It was all so beautiful, so perfect. What had happened in his family was the best thing he could ever have. He never could have been without her if he had wanted. She was such a beautiful woman, just so young, just so full of energy.</p> <p>He was so tired. He had gone to a bar, drank too many, and even when a drink wasn't on his list for him it would only be on him. He had seen a couple of beautiful women in the bar but it was nothing to be done to him. He wanted to be with her instead, but he felt she couldn't be with him because of what they did or didn't do. He finally found her home and found her sleeping in the spare bedroom and even though he was tired he wanted to make love to her. He kissed her gently. He just let love flow to him, he didn't want to stop him. She moved on top of him, she held him close and he felt her pussy on his cock. The two had an explosive orgasm on the bed.

They were on their sides when she woke up, she started to suck his cock till she came a second time. When she awoke up to him again in the next morning she saw him with the happiest smile on his face smiling down in her body. She went on top of him and showed her pussy to him.
