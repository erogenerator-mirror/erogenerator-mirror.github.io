Monseigneur in Town</h4><p><strong>Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris. Monseigneur was in his inner room, his sanctuary of</strong> a kind he would never forget. There was a huge bed where Monseigneur would lay, naked, waiting for the first man to have his way with him. He was dressed in a robe of rich red, and his body was glistening with sweat as the dark head of the dark, handsome king approached and took his hand to the lighted candle in the corner of the room. As Monseigneur looked at his new lord in the throes of passion, he pulled back the folds of the robe and ran his hands over the curves of Monseigneur's body. He pulled the robe open and laid his face in the silken cleft between Monseigneur's legs.</p> <p>"Ooou," breathed the deep bass of the king, "you smell wonderful." He put his lips on the king's pubic hair, then traced his tongue over the outer lips, tasting as he lapped the moisture there for one precious moment, and then licked the inner ones as he licked the wetness of his tongue inside his new lord's body.</p> <p>Monseigneur rolled to his back and he had both hands on Monseignez's head, holding he close as he rocked his body against the older man's mouth and tongue. "Take me, son," he panted as he raised his head and looked into the eyes of the dark lord as he brought his mouth back down to Monseignez's. Their lips locked tightly together as, in the blink of an eye, they each found their own rhythm, and their tongues danced in the forbidden union. When Monseignelen's cock was between his legs, he lifted his legs high in the air and opened his mouth.</p> <p>The King's body shook as he tasted Monseignez's cock, and a low, primal wail came from him as the new lord pushed his hardness all the way up into the warmth of his mouth.</p> <p>Monseignelen's cock was long and thick, and Monseignelen couldn't imagine anything more exquisite than how much a cock could make him feel. His king was taking in the newness of Monseignelles touch and his own, and it was amazing. The king opened his eyes as he leaned over Monseelles' body. They gazed into each other's eyes as they kissed.</p> <p>"Mmmm. My love, do you like being married to someone like me?" he softly whispered. Monseellen's lips trembled as Monseell's tongue slid through them.</p> <p>"You know I love you, Lord," Monseellen whispered, and he reached for the bedside table, then paused after he retrieved a jar of Vaseline.</p> <p>"I've been waiting for you for five years, you greedy bastard," Monseellen whispered, "you will always be mine." He moved quickly to Monseelles' mouth.</p> <p>Monseellen's tongue came out and ran over the King's lips. He sucked on his new lover's lips for what seemed like an eternity, but was only a minute or two before he began kissing down Monseellen's chin, down his chest and belly. When Monseelen opened his legs to him, Monseelen pushed his hands into the flesh of Monseellens thighs, then spread them wide, his face hovering over his new lover's cock.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me!" Monseelen groaned as he brought his lips to Monseell's cock. His mouth enveloped the thick shaft of the king as he pushed its head into Monseelles' mouth. His son took his place between Monseellelen's legs, and they kissed, as he slid up and down the slick muscle of Monseellens' body. After several long minutes of passionate foreplay, Monseelen lifted himself, then his legs hung off the edge of the bed and he lay down again. He turned to face the king as Monseellen's cock slid under him and it seemed to go on forever. He could feel the wetness of Monseelles' sex against his leg. Monseellen reached under Monseellresses neck, then raised himself up to his knees, then laid his body back on Monseelles' as his cock continued to slide into Monseelles' body. Monseelen, as the lighted candles were lighting up around them, put his hands on Monseelles neck and pulled his face down to his. Monseellen lowered his lips to Lameo's, and they kissed as the king had kissed before, just a short time before opening his mouth to Monse's and allowing the older man to taste Monse.</p> <p></p> <p>Lameo's lips. The man Lameo's hard cock.
