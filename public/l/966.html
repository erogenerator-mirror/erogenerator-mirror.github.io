He was right; the plan of battle conceived by him was, as we have seen, really admirable. The battle once begun,</strong> which was well worth a lot of time and planning, was done within one day.</p> <p>Since arriving home, Napoleon had not been with anyone so many times the previous week. The time and time spent was his; and he was happy. The fact that he was with a beautiful girl, a beautiful girl who looked exactly like he did, made life pleasant as all hell. The only regret of all of this was that we didn't use any of it.</p> <p>After he made love to her, we went to bed and held each other. It was the most passionate love-making we had even in his presence. She told me that she had never known such a pleasure to feel in her. She told me that I was doing the same thing to her that she was feeling with the feel of me. After her orgasm, she had asked me to carry her to the bedroom and make love to her until we climaxed. After we were satisfied, she rolled over to me and told me that she wished that that was where I was that she loved me and wanted me for as long as I cared. Afterward, she went to the bathroom to put her nightdress on and was back when I was at the counter. After she was done, we had coffee and a leisurely breakfast together. I was wondering what was next. She took me to a nearby park and we just sat in the parking lot, naked and loving, until we could get the day over. I didn't know what she was planning, but I didn't care. She told me we were going to have a lot of things to do around the home before we went back.</p> <p>The drive back to the city took only about sixty minutes and we only had to stop for the gas and electricity. In the car, there were no signs of either the love of her feelings or her plan to see me when we arrived. We pulled back into traffic, then she took my hand and led me to her room.</p> <p>As soon as we got inside, our lips met again. This time, she kissed my cheek, my neck, and took my hands away from mine. She kissed down my chest, along my arms, and then I heard her whisper sweet nothings to me in my ear again. She started in on my nipples with her tongue. Then she kissed her way down my stomach and over my groin. When she got to the part of my that I loved most from her, she kissed it in slow circles. The feeling of her tongue licking all around my cock and balls, made my nuts and my whole body throb.</p> <p>When she saw what she was doing, she got up and sat on the edge of the bed. She was naked. I stared at her. I don't think I ever noticed that she had a beautifully shaped body. But when she got down on her knees, she smiled when she saw my eye-level. She smiled again when she saw me looking at her. Then she lowered herself to my waiting body. I think we both knew we might not leave there for long.</p> <p>She stopped right in front of my cock and held it in her hand. We waited for each other, for the excitement to come over us to take control. It didn't really stop for a long while; we simply waited and then finally, it happened. She placed her lips around my cock and slowly slid downward. It felt great. In fact, I thought at first that you could go on forever.</p> <p>First, she licked her way down the shaft, going to the cockhead. When that happened, she kissed the glans and then took in the entire shaft into her mouth. It took every bit of air from her lips. I could feel her tongue licking me as her lips tightened on me. She took me deeper into her mouth.</p> <p>After a while, she released my cock from her mouth and stood up. She turned around and asked me to kiss her. It was just my second time. It felt wonderful. After our lips met, we started to kiss. Very gently, but passionately. I loved every second of it. She looked so pretty when we kissed. Her eyes were really bright and when our tongues parted, she held them in my arms.</p> <p>"Do you like my breasts?" she asked smiling.</p> <p>"Oh, they're fabulous," I replied. "They're the greatest, I mean, so natural and beautiful. But most of the time, I like to feel how they feel in my hands. They're like a little pillow you have. You are so sexy."</p> <p>"Do you feel them now?" she asked looking me in the eyes.</p> <p>"They're wonderful," I replied. I felt her hands rubbing them up. "So soft."</p> <p>when she was doing it.</p> <p>I said "I felt as she was Oh yes that she was so " Oh."
