Rider Haggard </h3><h4>CHAPTER XII The Sea Battle</h4><p><strong>The great Persian ship was on us. Strive as we would, we could not escape her. She raced upon our beam not a spear’s cast away. I stood upon the</strong> deck as she tore the shirt. Her skin was not as pale as a lamb’s, and she was fair in form, like a ripe plump wheat from an earlier hunt. As a result, I wanted to feast on her body. I knew that the ship’s water system must have been flooded by the ship, and my own water supply must have depleted by far the day before.</p> <p>My eyes drank in every inch of her as blood flooded her body in a tidal tidal wave of arousal. The light was not to be denied. Our mouths met again and we pressed our bodies against each other. The sounds of the ship’s engines could be heard in the distance. I heard the distant sounds of a ship approaching.</p> <p>Our kiss turned into a frantic, passionate kiss, and I broke the kiss. My lips pressed against hers in a passionate frenzy. My lips pressed into her ear, she could feel my hunger. She knew it, and yet, she held back none of it.</p> <p>“Ralph, you cannot kiss me so long, we cannot do this now. I want you more than ever. I want you inside me.” I looked into her eyes, and saw her look at me as if afraid. She had no desire to hide how ready I was for her. I felt her eyes bore into me as the engines began to shudder, heralding the arrival of our lover’s ship.</p> <p>“Oh, yes,” I said, as my fingers slid between our bodies, parting the silken wet warmth of her pussy. My fingers brushed against her swollen labia and I parted the lips of her sex with the slightest of touch, then slid inside. Her hands sought my face as my fingers began stroking their magic within her warm cavity.</p> <p>She gasped against my lips a bit in surprise of the feeling of her first touch – the feeling of an ardent kiss. Her body shuddered in a wave of pleasure.</p> <p>“I cannot imagine where your mind is as it is, darling. I must be the only one, to understand what I feel and what I am feeling. I must be the one, to make your needs manifest, to make pleasure known for your body to me.” I stroked my fingers over her labia, over her clitoris.</p> <p>Her hands sought my face, and her head lowered to my chest. She kissed my nipples, firstly the one that she had been nibbling my chest with her kisses while we kissed, and then the other, which she took into her mouth to taste and explore, to explore. She felt it against her cheek, her cheek, the tip of her nose. Her mouth continued to explore one breast, her tongue flicked out to suck tenderly on the nipple. Her hand began massaging its own self through the thin lacy fabric of the bodice of her dress. My other hand continued stroking her thighs, feeling and caressing the softness of her thigh. We kissed. Her mouth went to one of my nipples as my hand went to another, feeling their pliability as my body teased it against her.</p> <p>“Honey, do you feel what you feel?” she asked, as I felt the sensation of her hand on my breast. I felt the tension in my muscles tighten within my thigh, as my fingers found my clitoris.</p> <p>“Hes you feel?” I said. Then I felt her fingers gently slide inside her mouth, toying with the nipple that she had taken into her mouth. She kissed it, and sucked it gently in and out, as I stroked my clitoris and her cunt in turn.</p> <p>Her hands stroked me, as her mouth took and kissed my nipple. I felt her lips on my breasts – first the nipple itself, but soon her lips and tongue. I ran my fingers over her face and into her hair as she did the same with me, and when she raised her face to kiss me, I did so as well. My lips and tongue were once again under her control as I was her first lover, then – my second.</p> <p>She continued her tongue exploration for a bit but then her mouth found its way to my clitoris, and my hands found their way into her hair. When she came to me again, I felt my own clitoris press against her, and her fingers on my vagina. She took me within her mouth, and took me inside herself. She was sucking my clitoris and my vagina.</p> <p>I came. I came for the first time since the moment I saw her in the mirror earlier that morning, just moments before my orgasm, and my body convulsed into a rapturous, as I did. I felt this. It was the first of our love for each other that felt, for the other“ of us in the world. the world, in love we each, felt—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
