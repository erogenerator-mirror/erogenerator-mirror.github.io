THE LAURISTON GARDEN MYSTERY 6</h4><p><strong>I CONFESS that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the practical nature of my companion’s theories. My respect for his powers of analysis increased wondrously. There still</strong> there was something different about my companion than anything about any other, for that matter. I really wished for him to prove them to me. I knew I just might not be able to reach them.</p> <p>Suddenly, however, I felt my companion's hot body pressing against me, pressing against me like a warm-skinned man pressing against his woman. I didn’t feel his woman’s body but felt the warmth of her as I slipped the tip of my erection up and into her opening, my legs trembling as my hands instinctively wrapped around her. I was startled to feel her hand moving up and down over my shaft, not moving but keeping me firmly implanted inside her as I gently pushed slowly and carefully.</p> <p>I turned my head and our lips met as we slid into a hot, wet kiss, our tongues probing and caressing. Her hair cascaded down over me and I let my hands slide slowly over her soft skin. Her kisses drove me wild with desire, though I had no idea why. We continued kissing as I gently drew out of her and slipped out of her. She quickly came back over me, her arms wrapping around my neck for more, her lips and tongue taking over just as our lips had. I pressed my lips back into hers, pushing down into her just a little farther than before.</p> <p>I didn’t want things to get to where I was now, but I certainly had to. My hands were running over hers in a steady motion and our kissing was growing more and more passionate as our need for each other grew; my arms felt more and more strong around her as her hands slid over my back and down to my ass, sliding over my muscles. Then she pulled away, breathing heavily, leaning back so her chest pressed into mine.</p> <p>“Not yet,” I whispered hoarsely, giving her a peck on the lips. I rolled over, and we both slid to our knees on the floor while I pulled her into our arms, kissing her as my tongue entered her mouth and ran over her tongue. She groaned at the thought of our embrace as my hand cupped her breast again and rolled her nipple between my finger and thumb. She moved her tongue to my mouth and we kissed for an eternity.</p> <p>I was already half-erect as soon as I started to feel that sensation, so I began to work my way slowly back down her body, my tongue licking and lapping as I went. Soon thereafter, I kissed my way down her body, her legs spreading wider to accommodate me as the folds of her pussy became exposed, the flesh pink and vulnerable to our tongues. She groaned as I kissed her thighs, her knees parting to welcome me to her body. I kept kissing that beautiful place until I felt her fingers running through my hair and urging me on.</p> <p>I had a sudden flash of a thought. Could she like it? I thought she was the most beautiful woman I’d ever known. And who knows, maybe, I thought with a brief chuckle. If not so, then maybe it would help her find out as well. My tongue licked gently over her labia that were already slick with her juices. Slowly, I felt the soft flesh against my lips. I had never liked the idea of eating a woman’s vagina. I felt nothing but the warmth surrounding my mouth and thought about just lying here for a while.</p> <p>Suddenly, I felt her hand push down and pull me back up to her clit, I groaned at her sudden turn of attitude. It only took a few more licks before I felt her hand squeezing my hard tool hard. She pulled me up into her while my tongue worked over her clit, then pressed me down on her, sliding down until her pussy was positioned right above my cock. She pushed down a couple of times and I was so wet that her entire pussy lips were sliding up and down on my shaft.</p> <p>With her other hand, she began massaging her breast, pulling and twisting her nipple as my tongue slid back down over her clit, then up over her vaginal opening. Finally, she pushed down hard, impaling her body full on my rod and letting her muscles contract hard. She groaned deeply, her muscles milking my hardness with each stroke, the skin around my shaft shining softly as she stroked herself rhythmically.</p> <p>Then, she slowly began to ride me, sliding up and down, up and down, taking a couple of seconds for each stroke to slide up over her sensitive clit and then sliding back down onto me. I closed my eyes as I felt her body respond to such a wonderful sensation. She was moaning again, her body rocking and bucking in time to the movement of her hips. Soon I felt her hand pulling my face to her pussy while the one of her hands gripped my hair. Then I was holding my head at the other to her breast and pressing all the other against her body as—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
