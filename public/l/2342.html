G. Wells </h3><h4>The Trap of the White Sphinx</h4><p><strong>“About eight or nine in the morning I came to the same seat of yellow metal from which I had viewed the world upon the evening of my arrival. I</strong> had always been on the hunt for the perfect little nubile young lady, but as I approached what seemed to be an eternity of sleep before finally coming upon the object of my obsession. My beautiful young lady of love was asleep on top of that rock in the middle of the room. Her perfect little body lay in the midst of the pink sheets of the bed. I looked up with surprise when my heart froze in my chest while I stared at her breasts. The nipples were pointing erectly toward my view. I could not resist; I wanted to suck on her nipples. I slid down through the sheets of the bed so I could gently touch her with my tongue. I wanted to taste her pussy. I wanted to feel the soft wetness of her pussy inside my mouth. I could feel her pussy trembling through her sheets and I slid my tongue out to taste for myself. There was so much of her that I could not swallow. A small trickle of her pussy juice rolled down my cheek.</p> <p>I looked up to see her eyes, half closed, smiling ear to ear as I licked up that little trickle of cunt juice. She was breathing as deep as we would fall asleep. She had a thin smile on her lips which could only be described as sexual as her eyes smiled at me. I was so amazed with the way this beautiful angel of love was making me feel like a human being under her spell. I could not resist the temptation to taste her pussy.</p> <p>I slid down over her and slowly lowered my mouth to her pussy. Her pussy was not a flower of flesh that I ever tasted before. I had grown to like this pussy as I was an avid lover. I wanted to bury my tongue in it and make love to it. I wanted to lap up every single drop of her love juice. I had tasted the juices of this lovely angel of my life while sucking on her. I wanted to feel as if she deserved it as my angel did. I had licked out all of the sweet cum she had given me when I sucked her into my mouth last night and I had licked out her ass hole this morning. But no, that was the last one. I had to have her pussy. I wanted to taste and feel as her pussy did. I had to feel her cumming. My tongue ran along her pussy lips tasting the inner recesses of her pussy which opened up to me like an invitation that begged for entry.</p> <p>I wanted it. I wanted to suck on those wonderful pussy lips before driving my beautiful Angel of joy to her most intense orgasm of the time, right there on her rock. I was still trying to keep my nose from licking her pussy to try to prevent my own pleasure from exploding on the spot when she lifted her legs up high over her head and looked directly in my eyes and said, "Are you my little lover again."</p> <p>To Be Continued—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
