G. Wells </h3><h4>The Time Traveller Returns</h4><p><strong>I think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time Machine. The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who are too clever</strong>, too adaptable for us to take credit for things we don't understand.</p> <p>We were a race of scientists, people who knew all kinds of information, who believed in time and space exploration, but were afraid to embrace that technology. So one of us got married and we had sex almost every week.</p> <p>To the best of our knowledge, time has no meaning for us or us for us to grasp. The whole science fiction/fantasy kind was a waste of time to us, but now it comes to us.</p> <p>My name is Chris and I want to ask you something about your mind-set. This is not your first time here on this trip, but I think it's your first time to experience life. There's some really amazing stuff in this place and you've done some amazing things. Let me think on it for a few moments and then maybe you can talk about it with me and just have fun.</p> <p>It's time to do some reading and research. It's time to learn more about the Time Machine. That's it. That's all I can offer.</p> <p>By the way, back to your question. The thing is that most of you do some amazing things and you only find out how to actually use it. It might be worth looking around one more time, but if you try and use your mind-talent, and if you know how to use it, I just might give you a better clue.</p> <p>This is about sharing with you what I learned to actually use a time machine, and what I've been able to do.</p> <p>Thank you for reading this guide. Please take your time and enjoy. Please take your time, either here or on line. You'll find it easy to do. Don't take long to decide, because I'm going to be at work for a while.</p> <p>Chris</p> <p>*********************************</p> <p>Chris and his colleagues watched her intently from the main auditorium as she sat alone amongst the various tables scattered about.</p> <p>She had just walked into the auditorium through an outer door in the back of the hall when the door opened and it was clear that they had entered a much more personal space and were no longer at another point in the hall.</p> <p>The auditorium itself had no windows except through the upper part of the roof and the main lights were off though so people could see anything that came from outside. The only bright spot in the arena was an enormous view of the surrounding streets and the surrounding countryside.</p> <p>Her head was resting on a tall, muscular man with an arm around his shoulders, who had one leg propped up on a chair and was sitting on his lap with his face buried in her cleavage. From the look of it she was riding his cock into ecstasy and she was moaning loudly from the pleasure.</p> <p>Her dress was bunched up against her hips, giving a clear view of a bare slit just above, where one man's member was rapidly sliding in and out of her.</p> <p>She saw a young man stand up and then sit down in one of the larger seats, while looking around at his colleagues, all in various states of undress. Her head was back against the man's shoulder.</p> <p>A few moments later she felt someone's hand grasp her right breast. One of her wrists was still bound and a moment later another hand was tugging at her right nipple before releasing it. This time she felt the nipple being twisted. She arched her back, pressing onto the man's cock and shuddered.</p> <p>After a moment's hesitation the other hand came up to her left nipple and she felt fingers rubbing it. In response she arched her chest up and back, pressing against her hands and arching her back.</p> <p>After five or six minutes of this she felt the man lift her up. He sat down on top of her, still supporting her by grasping the nape of her neck with one hand while he sat back and pulled her hips toward him with the other hand in her hips. She gasped.</p> <p>He released her neck and her head fell back. They continued to look around the auditorium for the young man he had lifted to stand and she felt him moving closer to her.</p> <p>He was standing in a very large circle, with several of his colleagues in similar positions. His legs were stretched out, giving him an alluring view of the muscles on his legs and the bulge in his groin.</p> <p>She felt the fingers of one of his hands on her hip, tracing the shape there.</p> <p>When another hand was on her knee and the fingers of the other hand on her neck she had an instantaneous orgasm. She started to shake.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"Ahhh...</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Hh.</p> <p></p> <p>ah</p> <p>ah</p> <p>ah</p> <p>h</p> <p>h</p> <p>ah</p> <p>uh</p> <p>ah</p> <p>hâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
