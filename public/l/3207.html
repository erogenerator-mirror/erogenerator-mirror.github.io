English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>VIII. THE TREE ON THE HILL.</h4><p><strong>Zarathustra’s eye had perceived that a certain youth avoided him. And as he walked alone one evening over the hills surrounding the town called “The Pied Cow,” behold, there found</strong> him standing alone, his cock already stirring with the thought of fucking Zarathustra. And while he waited, he wondered which one of would eventually get the first chance. “Sodomorrah?” he muttered. A good enough thought to tell him, as time passed.</p> <p>He knew, of course, that Zarathustra was the most gorgeous girl. Not too tall, not too wide, and not too short. In fact, in short order with him standing there in the afternoon sun, she was surrounded by an assortment of beautiful, shapely, young women, all in various stages of undress, some of them looking as radiantly beautiful as the older one. And all of the females seemed ready to take their clothes off.</p> <p>Not a bad idea, of course. But his mind remained alert and not to be distracted by her beauty that she would offer to him. She didn't see him staring at her.</p> <p>So he sat down again, as soon as his attention fell upon his girlfriend. Her breasts were more than a handful, and not in the state of gravity where gravity was used to be present. But just as he couldn't resist them, as he watched her unfasten her bra and release her succulent, pink lips from their folds, he felt himself becoming aroused.</p> <p>She was still staring at him, her eyes wide, and not moving. But still she made motions, and moved her hair around to keep it up, or to cover or to brush her hands over her nipples. And he tried to think of something to say, but it was difficult to concentrate.</p> <p>He couldn't stop thinking of the incredible feeling when he saw her, of seeing her body, of taking her in, of fucking her, of making love to her, of taking her again and again, every way he felt those years earlier and again—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
