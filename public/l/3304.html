English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter XLII. Redemption.</h4><p><strong>Zarathustra here addresses cripples. He tells them of other cripples—the GREAT MEN in this world who have one organ or faculty inordinately developed at the cost of their other faculties.</strong></p> <p>"I'm a cripple and I need a good fuck, don't you?" he grins, thrusting his hips at me so provocatively as if expecting me to respond with an action of some sort. I just nod and agree with it. I want to get fucked—I want his cock in me. I've been waiting to get fucked.</p> <p>"So are you a little late, Miss B?", he asks again. "You know: I'm a fucking cripple—you might have met with my friends, but you might have met with my mother and her boyfriend. What's your name, Miss B?"</p> <p>After such an enthusiastic response, I tell the story of how I met with my mother, how I had sex with her boyfriend, and how I ended up on my knees on a beach, sucking off my husband while we watched the action on the television.</p> <p>We're lying together between the sheet that covers us. His soft lips encircle mine like a lover. We feel one another's bodies touching. I press one of my hands to his chest, feeling it move down to his flat stomach. His body is covered with sweat. I lift his shirt up, exposing a toned stomach. I can see his stomach muscles ripple with tension as I remove his shirt. We kiss his upper chest. His body feels taut because of his muscles and because of his muscles, so I raise to allow him to remove my top with one swift downward motion. It is only when he pulls my top over my head does he notice the tautness.</p> <p>He begins to touch my body with his hands as he kisses me. His hands rove across my body. He begins with light touches, caressing my skin, tracing my lips. When they touch my breasts, I feel a bit embarrassed by it.</p> <p>He kisses his way down my stomach, moving past my navel to my thigh. I feel his hot breath as he comes to my pussy. I moan as he spreads my lips so he can lick my clit. He licks away, leaving my clit just aching for him. He touches my ass, and with my help, he begins to penetrate me with just two fingers. I am writhing and moaning as he continues to finger-fuck my pussy.</p> <p>I pull his face toward mine. He takes my mouth in his, and I feel our tongues exploring each other's mouths as we kiss and he plays with my clit with his mouth. He inserts two fingers and begins to fuck my pussy without any gentleness. The combination of our tongues together, his fingers in my pussy, and of my clit is almost too much for me to withstand.</p> <p>He breaks our kiss, and kisses my lips again, and asks if he can fuck my ass again. I don't say yes, just say he can fuck my pussy and play with my ass again, and he does so. He presses his body against mine, and his hard dick presses against my cunt. He wants to take me there. He wants to fuck me there. He says it will go up in my pussy, and I tell him it will go up in my ass.</p> <p>We lay on our sides, his dick nestled between the cheeks of my ass as I wrap my leg around his hip and he wraps me in his arms. He holds me firmly against his hip and he lifts his head and kisses me deep, his cock pressing into my pussy. It is hard and it is all I need—and desire is such a powerful motivator on my part.</p> <p>He removes my panties slowly and carefully, just so he can see the tight and warm tunnel that was made to accommodate him. He kneels between my legs and begins to slide his cock into me. I push back, trying to help him enter me as much as possible.</p> <p>He reaches between our bodies and begins to tease his cock inside of me—toying with me. His lips kiss and part to kiss the underside of my breasts and my stomach. I feel him throbbing against my ass.</p> <p>He begins to stroke inside of me while he plays with my tits. When he comes to my anus, he inserts his head inside. I feel it pop inside the tight opening, and I push back to encourage it inside.</p> <p>He is still inside of me even while I'm pushing toward him. I feel his breath on my neck as he begins to tongue my ear. He stops to kiss me on the lips, and continues into me. The sensations are so wonderful. My pussy clenches around him with every thrust. I'm so horny I can't help but moan. I feel my ass clench, but I don't cum from my husband out of him. I want him inside of my pussy. When my ass, I feel his fingers exploring my anus. He is in me.</p> <p></p> <p>He begins to press him to me, he again. He begins to—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
