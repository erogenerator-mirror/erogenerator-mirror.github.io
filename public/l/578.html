In Petersburg she had enjoyed the special protection of a grandee who occupied one</strong> of the most privileged rooms on a small island, and the pleasure of the sex had been almost overwhelming, until now. After making her first official, an international effort for marriage she had been granted a special exemption to her special protection, since a special rule against illegal sex was passed through by a special committee composed at the local courthouse. Even the committee could now be recognized, and it became official in a short time; as the only member in the committee was an old woman who had passed a legal age.</p> <p>The committee had a strict code, set by the committee after the committee had passed. The members had the first right to decide how to deal with any person or thing found at the party. It was a standard issue in that the committee members could also apply legally, but there were complications, as well as practical aspects. Some spouses still expected this marriage, even if they had no intention of cheating. The committee decided that only when a spouse had been found at a sexual event would the committee approve. And the committee did.</p> <p>In the next room a man in full robes arrived. He was seated at a table near a window, looking off into the distance, when a very pregnant woman approached the chair. Once she had settled in there he continued to sit and talk to the woman. He sat down for a while and then said something about a wedding, as a gesture toward him, as if he knew the woman was ready to join him. The woman smiled politely and said something about this being her first time of marriage. This had been arranged while the committee was present, and now she was the bride. She turned and got to her feet, and went to the man in the chair. He stood up. The woman leaned against him. They kissed. The couple kissed again, then the man unbuttoned the woman's blouse, exposing her belly. The woman stood up and helped the man out of his robe, then he helped himself out of his clothes. The couple embraced once again.</p> <p>In the next room, another man sat with the wife, and one of three men, the wife, who hadn't come herself by now had come on him. He sat on the floor and the wife began to caress the man's penis, as his wife sat on the other man's lap. The man had a small penis, just a few millimeters or two, a little shorter than the man whose cock was now in her hand. The wife began pumping the man's penis, pulling on the skin, stretching it as she rubbed her vagina. While the man thrust up toward the other man's face, the other man sucked on the wife's breasts, as his wife pumped up and down the other man's penis. The man was a young man. He couldn't have been much older than the wife, but he was very tall and fit, especially in the groin region. He could have been as fat as a tree. He had a small penis. If she could have been a tree she'd have been a tree. The man's penis was just long, even if it wasn't erect. So much flesh around the head that she could just barely wrap her lips around the shaft, no one ever actually knew how long it was.</p> <p>The wife got up and sat back with the wife standing behind, fondling the other's penis. The other man had gotten up to kiss the wife before she could stand, but now she had to watch the other man fuck the man she hadn't come herself, and her breasts jiggled every time the other man pushed up his pelvis. The husband was sucking the husband's penis for every millimeter of her attention. The husband would pull his lips away long enough to say something, then she would suck his penis again, until it grew hard again. On occasion the husband would be able to suck on the wife's clitoris while she masturbated the other man. The wife was excited by his ministrations, and by the thought of sex she began rocking her hips and making the penis move faster. The wife began moaning. The other man must have been in the same state because the wife was starting to come, and she had to put her hand under her mouth to muffle her shrieks. The wife stopped sucking the husband, and grabbed the penis which had now become fully erect in her hand. The other man put his penis in the wife's mouth, which her mouth opened to let the penis into, as he pushed it into the wife. The wife went wild and came twice more.</p> <p>The couple, and the woman, who still had her skirt pulled up, got back on the table. They kissed, then the wife kissed the other man, as the husband held her hands on his penis. The woman was sitting up and a little way up, with a few fingers running through her long hair, and and she sat up to the hair from the penis. The husband as the penis. The wife began to the head and the wife kissed—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
