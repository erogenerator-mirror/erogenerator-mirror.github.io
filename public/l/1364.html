Expiation</h4><p><strong>Notwithstanding the density of the crowd, M. de Villefort saw it open before him. There is something so awe-inspiring in great afflictions that even in the worst times the first</strong> act, with good ole man could, could go on forever. There is nothing so beautiful in life that was worth enduring as he was, so much as he was.</p> <p>"I am going to fuck you," he said. "You are going to love it. You're going to love it."</p> <p>The first act began. It was hard for William to believe the second act was about to start. He stared into the eyes of his wife. God, yes, he was going to fuck her; this was only his second act.</p> <p>The second act began. There was always a first act. The act itself couldn't begin to convey the emotions that were going to be experienced. But, by this time, they were, and were, about as close to the next act as the first. The two of them were going to get it together, too.</p> <p>"You'd better get going, Bill. I'm going to have to take my gown off, too. Do you have any underwear?"</p> <p>William's eyes moved back and forth between the two men before him. William was the first to reach down behind his neck. Then, he pulled his shirt over his head. He held his hands in front of his body. The shirt came over his head as well, and William held his hands in front of his body. His shirt came off as he stood there, fully naked. He turned slightly to the side.</p> <p>"I have underwear, too, but I'm all bare. Why don't you get in bed and we'll play with each other."</p> <p>He quickly got in bed with Carol. He'd never really thought of Carol, but, in his experience at the time, she seemed to fit the situation. Now, he took that last little bit of the show, and was about to have it all.</p> <p>Bill, of course, didn't actually get into bed with her. Only that he was going to do her. In his opinion, there was no better place to have sex than in bed with your spouse. He had a tendency to believe in the moral values of men for the simple and obvious reason that they have sex with someone who makes them feel good. And, at first, Bill had to admit that sex with Carol was more erotic than with a man. He was right. It was all over with.</p> <p>After several minutes, Carol leaned over to Bill and kissed him. They both knew what was coming. Bill, knowing he wasn't going to get another chance, was ready to give in. He held on tightly to the bed as Carol leaned into him. Their tongues and kisses went on and on and on. Both knew that the next act would be of equal value, both in the bedroom and in the bedroom of their new lovers.</p> <p>And, they were just getting started. There was the first act, which began. In that act, each man stood before his wife. He held the camera in his hands. One hand held his erect penis. The other, he held his hands. With each man standing before his wife, it was hard for Bill to stand. It was just too hard.</p> <p>"Now, let's have some fun."</p> <p>Bill pushed against the headboard of the king size bed. It was a strange way to say that he was in bed with his wife, but, he quickly remembered that it was the one with the mirror, so he didn't put it down. He wasn't going to try to do anything for a while. He was content to be in bed.</p> <p>"Let me taste you," Carol said with a smile. She leaned forward and took his penis in her mouth. She gave it a few swirls. Then, she kissed him. This time, she put it in her mouth, and sucked him. When she felt he was going to cum, she pulled away to swallow. She didn't let him have it, though. She wanted to feel him cum when he came.</p> <p>"Go ahead, Bill," she said. She had him lie down.</p> <p>"I'm ready to start," he said as she slid off her panties and shoes.</p> <p>Bill sat up. The show ended, but there was a happy expression across his body. He had always been curious about the feel of underwear rubbing against the naked genitals of another man. He would love to have seen what that felt like to two naked women.</p> <p>The camera began to shoot. The first scene caught Carol, leaning over to the bed and kissing Bill. The second showed Bill, now laid back with his eyes closed, watching his wife's hands in the mirror fondle herself. The third scene showed Carol, Bill, Bill, in the mirror, Bill's cock, his wife on the other man, and woman playing with another man. The man. The final scene was the man's penis rubbing each one doing a woman giving them a turn. Both togetherâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
