Up and down, from one age to another, go the ordinary things of</h4><p><strong>the world; being still the same. And either of everything in particular before it come to pass, the mind of the universe doth consider with itself and deliberate: and if</strong> it do's something, well, I'm definitely gonna do it.</p> <p>Well, as it happens, one thing is sure to change this planet, so I do.</p> <p>I put one hand in my pants, while I slid my cock into the tight confines of my jeans. I could feel her hands as they slid all over my body, her fingernails scraping my back and my armpits. I took her hand off the wall and I led her up to the bed, where I sat her down on the footstool. I didn't need a second; I slid my hands up her calves and I placed my hands firmly in my lap, waiting for her.</p> <p>It wasn't too long but it was definitely less agonising. It was about to be about anything. I put one hand on her chest and put the other in hers. Her breasts spilled out of their confines and I took my hands off of them. I was taking time to enjoy the feeling, but to a certain extent, so long as she felt the same, her senses would be attuned to my movements.</p> <p>The feel of a woman's breasts, the feeling I just had of feeling them, was all too much for my cock. I knew she was aware of it, of the heat her body was causing, she seemed to be aware of it in ways I couldn't. As I began to slide my cock into her, I could feel her heart beating against my leg. After she'd orgasmed once just moments ago, it's like she was trying to take me in for eternity, and then she couldn't. This time wasn't going to be short, but quick.</p> <p>"Ready?" I whispered to her, giving her one more chance to get up and come to the other side.</p> <p>She made no movement, but I was getting close. I looked back at her while I began to pump my hips against hers. Her eyes stared deep into mine, and I could tell she wanted to.</p> <p>I was still looking at her with nothing more than a look. Her breasts were the first thing I noticed; but her nipples seemed bigger and darker. I could feel a sensation, like a light, building and building. Her moans and breathing were getting louder and more frequent. I placed my hands over hers, so they could be on her body, but she let me do the rest; I could just feel the warmth of every movement her body was making as I pumped myself into her. The way she pushed back against me, the way she was lifting her body. I was so close now.</p> <p>"Oh God!" I heard her scream in ecstasy. I could feel it coming. I felt the waves of her pleasure, as I pumped myself into her. The feeling I was giving, even from the back of the first place, was so incredible. If we hadn't been so close together I would have collapsed to the floor. But it seemed like she was going to orgasm all on her own.</p> <p>By this time she wasn't even aware of it and I was still feeling it happening. I was getting closer. I kept pumping myself into her and she was so close. I reached down and I put two fingers into her cunt. But it wasn't enough. I wanted something else. I didn't want to fuck her. To fuck, but to come.</p> <p>"I'm coming baby!", I couldn't say or do anything. I could already feel the pressure in my balls rising in preparation for my orgasm. I wanted to get this woman to climax, but I wasn't ready. The feeling was too strong. Maybe it was because I was feeling her pleasure, but it was also because of the way we were touching. I didn't let go of her breast, but I gave her one last look. Her legs parted and let go her breasts. I was going to make it.</p> <p>The way I looked at her, as I felt that she made me come was too much for me to resist. I felt the first few moments when my body was going to react to something that was happening to me but I did it to myself, instead of to anyone else.</p> <p>My fingers felt like they were hurting, but I put two out here. I got into it and I pushed myself as far as I could into her vagina. I rubbed her clitoris with my thumb and then I moved it to feel her body as I pumped myself into her. I felt the warmth inside her. I couldn't help myself but to feel how much longer this could be before I came. It was already one of the most intense climaxes I have ever experienced. I held myself back from climaxing and waiting for the inevitable.</p> <p>I felt her body, her muscles, pulsate around me. My first orgasm. I had seen as her in person was moving, until they wanted me. Just her body. I was. When she wanted me, and something. I wanted herâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
