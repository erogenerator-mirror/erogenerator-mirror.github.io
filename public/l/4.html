For all of them it had been almost awkward. For each of them it had been the most intense, most mind-bending experience.</p> <p>Now all were talking about it. There were thousands of those, no, and even fewer that weren't discussing it. To be blunt one might even call it 'getting naked and fucking.' There were even countless other things that didn't make any sense to them until they started talking about it. Some of it might have made sense while others just seemed silly because they were so out of touch with reality that it was difficult to understand why this sort of discussion was so important.</p> <p>But all of that was really simple and fun. For each of them it was a way to talk about something that they thought was important to some other world.</p> <p>It was really an all-important matter that they did not even hear the sound of the words that would be written as they walked up the long driveway with the rest of the family sitting down at it.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>It was late afternoon, a few months after Jane and Elizabeth were finally legally married on Valentine's Day. Although they had been married for two years, they had never really discussed them in a sexual way so it had been something they simply had to do. It would have been even more awkward when Elizabeth had mentioned that it was more of a present from her sister than actually her present. Perhaps it would have been worse to have known that it was something more, but the memory of what it was that Elizabeth had said that night made it seem as if there just might not be many other things about it that they could not even imagine.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>It had been a very wonderful day for the two of them. For sure not as good as it had the last time they would be together. But that had been a lot different than it had been for Jane and Elizabeth. They both had enjoyed it, the pleasure it had given them. Not quite as much as that first evening but certainly better. Now it was a little different.</p> <p>Jane could actually feel her brother's erection pressed firmly against her thigh. She rubbed against it, against her skirt, against her panties. A thin piece of fabric at the bottom of them separated all three of them. Her brother's erection had somehow felt better pressed against her thigh and it felt even better against her panties. She could not get over the fact that her panties were damp and her skirt was still pulled up so far that she was pressing her entire thigh against his hard penis. She had felt her underwear get wet and she knew that she was really rubbing herself against the hardness of her brother's erection.</p> <p>It was the feeling of having just the slightest touch and then a feeling as if the panties were suddenly completely off. Like a bolt of static electricity through their skin.</p> <p>It excited Jane even more. The feeling of having her brother's erection pressed firmly against her thigh as it felt so wonderfully hard. It was like having something that had been in there, in her sex as well as her body.</p> <p>It was almost as much a thrill as having her brother's hard-on pressing against her skirt, hard against her bra, against her skirt as it felt deliciously hard against her hand. It was better than having it pressed against her bra, against anyone other than her brother - but even worse than that. It was better than having her sister's panties all the way down around her waist and her brother's erection thrusting against her thigh as if trying to find a way to get to her. It was better than having this much sexiness with the feel of her brother's erection against her skirt. It was better than having her brother's hands on the bare skin of her breasts and the feel of him rubbing against her. It was better than having her brother's erection pressing against her and pressing against her bottom. It was better than having her brother's hands on her waist and her sitting on him and all of that.</p> <p>That's how it was. They could feel each other's breasts, they could feel their pussies pressing against each other's thighs and it felt so wonderful having Jane's brother's hard erection pressing firmly against her. It felt better than having her brother's erection pressing against her bottom and she was doing the same. It felt better than having a man's hands touching her bottom, rubbing over her panties and all of it having her brother's hot erection pressing against her as she sat on him. It felt more than better than having a man's hand resting between her legs, rubbing her sex against her panties, rubbing over her pubic area. It felt much better having it all three of their bodies were pressing against each other, they were naked, but even more than it was feeling underwear in pairs of clothes in their clothes.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>the same clothesâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
