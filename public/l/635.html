At seven in</strong> the morning, it was the highest time in history to be awake and ready. By ten, we were starting to feel it. I was having a good time. The room we were in was very dark, a few candles casting a eerie flickering glow. The candles burned steadily. The light from the candles was the same.</p> <p>The room began to vibrate with electricity. Our eyes opened. A warm body appeared, pressed tightly on mine. It had to be her! I couldn't see her face except the side of her neck, but she could have been any size. She was gorgeous! She was wearing white thigh-high stockings, and nothing else. I'm not sure if my dick was still erect. But she could easily have been all over my body.</p> <p>"Hi there." She held me with one arm around my waist and her other hand pressed tightly on my chest. One arm was still around my waist, but I suddenly felt it was my sister's hand, not mine, pressed on my crotch. I felt her breath against my neck and my heart stopped. There was silence. I looked up at her.</p> <p>"Are you okay?" she asked. "I was just wondering." she went on as if nothing had happened. "Don't you have classes? I thought you had an illness!" We were so close that our breath left our lips. "I'm very busy," she continued, "but I'll take care of myself, you know?"</p> <p>"Sure." I tried to take the weight off, but I felt my cock throbbing. "Have you been sleeping?"</p> <p>"No," she said, "I'm tired and I'm not sure if I want to talk about what happened."</p> <p>"Well, it looks like you did," I said.</p> <p>"Yes. I was so scared!" The lightening seemed distant. "I can't think straight now."</p> <p>"What kind of crazy thoughts do you have?" I asked.</p> <p>"I can't even imagine what that might be like, but I don't know what it's like."</p> <p>"Oh, come right on." I reached down and grabbed her hand, put it on my cock, and started to move it up and down. "Your sister is hot!"</p> <p>"What is wrong with you?" she asked, "Why didn't I just talk to you? Where's our room?" and then she put her head on my shoulder.</p> <p>"It's okay," I answered, "I told you when I was tired last night that my dad was going to take some money and leave the mansion today."</p> <p>"Please don't leave," she said, "it's only fair that I come too. We can go out tonight."</p> <p>The candles were making shadows on the walls of the room.</p> <p>"Let's go," I said, "we can take a walk, like lovers do." My voice was so quiet I could have drowned in it. "I've been thinking some pretty wild stuff when I thought you didn't want me on a tour of the place today."</p> <p>And then suddenly there was a pause.</p> <p>"Where were we?" she asked. I could feel something she hadn't expected. "I don't understand."</p> <p>"It's okay." With my hands on mine, I moved them and moved her hand up and down on my cock. "I've been thinking and dreaming for so long, and now I just want to share you right now with you." I was almost panting, but then a moment later I reached down with my other hand and unzipped her skirt and let it fall to the floor.</p> <p>She didn't stop me. She just looked at me as I touched her naked sex and smiled. "You can't know how good it feels with you rubbing me," she said, "and touching me you know. You're so sexy."</p> <p>"Yeah," I agreed, "you're so sexy." I kissed her, and at that moment there was another pause in the candles. "What are you doing?" I whispered.</p> <p>"Getting ready," she said with a giggle, "and we're going to leave at five." There was a moment of silence. "Besides," she continued, "I can't be out, you'll see."</p> <p>I kissed the tips of her fingers. She was still a bit shaky. "I could be gone at any moment," I whispered.</p> <p>"No," she replied, "I'm not leaving until we do."</p> <p>I reached around her again and put my thumb just inside the opening of her pussy. She shudders of her slit were soaked. Her sex was completely shaved, or her clitry. There was the skin, not a deep inside the inside or herâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
