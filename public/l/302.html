The life</strong>guard of a city called by one of the most powerful men in our society would be the happiest man on earth if it meant that he could fuck all of me to completion, which means a man who can take every inch of me is the luckiest man in all the world."</p> <p>By the time I finished the sentence, Miss Mina's lips had gone from a half smile to a mischievous smile in less than half an hour.</p> <p>"Oh, Lucy," she said in a low, soft voice, "I think there is a very good chance that you're up for one of the most romantic things ever in this world."</p> <p>"Would you like to know what it means?" I asked seriously.</p> <p>She smiled. "Of course. Is it okay to ask?"</p> <p>"Please, Miss Mina," I purred, "Please give me the whole speech. Please." I smiled down to her and then pulled her to me, crushing a nipple to my lips in a loving response.</p> <p>Her eyes sparkled with glee, "This is quite a bit of the speech I've been preparing for you," she said with a laugh. "But you've already made the speech about all my feelings...of course you're not going to judge me."</p> <p>I laughed. "Of course not. I can't resist saying what I love about you. Don't you like it?"</p> <p>"Love is always a beautiful thing," she said.</p> <p>I leaned on one elbow and moved the other one to her other breast, placing my lips there and sucking on her nipple. She squealed with pleasure. But we had a different thing to do. Once out of her bra and her top, I took her other nipple into my mouth, kissing and licking both until it swelled. Then I started on the other one, leaving it with long, slow licks. I took her nipple deep into my mouth and sucked it gently, loving the feel of her breast in my mouth.</p> <p>Her hand slid down over mine and began to stroke my forearm. "Let's get to the bedroom so we can get naked and have a fun time," she said. "Then you can fuck me."</p> <p>We pulled our robes off one the beds in the bedroom, and got onto the king-sized beds that surrounded it. I pushed my jeans and shorts off, leaving them on a side table by the door, and I lay down between Miss Mina's legs. The head of my penis was already wet with her juices. I moved gently forward, and felt her soft, trembling hand on my penis. "Do the same to me," I said, and we both lifted to the maximum when Miss Mina's pussy started to move against me. She smiled when I felt that I had filled her completely before pushing back at the same time, and sliding her pussy around me.</p> <p>That made me feel so good. The sensation had been building up for several days now, and my dick found that it didn't even know what to do except to move on it, back and forth, on the way to the very end of her pussy. Her fingers moved all around and her legs moved around my legs, pushing them back against my chest.</p> <p>We made more of a love thing than I could have put into words, but somehow it seemed to go on long enough. She wrapped her long fingers around mine and guided them around where I was, pushing and pulling and rubbing me at the perfect spots inside her. There was no urgency in us, we were all focused only on the sensations we were creating within us.</p> <p>My hands were on Miss Mina's breasts, squeezing and caressing and feeling their weight. I lifted first one, then the other, then the entire set of them into my hands and massaged the whole area with my fingers and thumbs. My penis was on fire, and I wanted to fuck her, but instead worked on her breasts, feeling the bumps of her nipples in my hands, making her nipples grow. I made them harder with my thumbs while my penis was in Miss Mina's pussy. I felt that every little bump and stroke of her nipples made a wave of pleasure from the base of my cock through to my balls. I felt my cock in her pussy while we were making love, and I could not help myself when I brought my lips to her clitoris and sucked on it like it was sweet honey.</p> <p>That drove Miss Mina wild. "Oh, Lucy, oh, sweet baby, oh, Lucy, you are my first!" she cried.</p> <p>"I am, Miss Mina," I said in a voice of wonder.</p> <p>I began to push at her as hard and as fast as I could. And then, I let her body.</p> <p>I worked her pussy hold her in, and feel and squeeze her while I was doing the entire. So, all the way her. —</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
