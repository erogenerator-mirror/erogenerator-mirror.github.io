For a second when she looked behind her, she was happy she was in her bathing suit and not the other way around. It did not matter that the two of them were naked, but she looked too. Edna smiled, she was glad she had done this years ago, her face reminded her of those who looked past her years, she thought she felt that happy today. There had been some moments before, though. She glanced down, Robert's cock was hard, she knew she could feel it and so could a man.</p> <p>She was pleased, a little bit, she liked having her face inches from that hard cock. It didn't matter what anyone would say about it, she could feel it touching her face. She looked back up and saw a hand with fingers wet with pre cum. She smiled and licked them, her other hand still squeezing Robert, that thing between her legs felt good, but it could be even better. She smiled, again as she opened her mouth, this time taking the swollen helmet into her mouth. It filled her mouth and she began to suck, her lips moving as she sucked, one hand squeezing the shaft and the other moving up and down the slippery shaft as she took a few more inches into her mouth.</p> <p>Robert was surprised, surprised, he couldn't go to the beach with her. Edna was very shy, never one to do this in public. He was also incredibly horny, he had been with a lot of women, some of which had gone for him, a few of whom had done that with some guy. So it wouldn't shock him in the least.</p> <p>She began to move her mouth up and down as if she were sucking cock, she could feel him get very hard. She moved her head up and back, taking more and more of him down her throat. She looked down to see that his cock sliding in and out of her mouth as she sucked him. She looked over, saw Edna looking, her eyes wide as Edna and her husband watched her suck her husband's penis.</p> <p>Edna watched Edna watching as she sucked Robert's cock, she had felt it in her mouth, she had tasted it many times in her life. She was pleased that her friend had found it so attractive. Her body was reacting to seeing another girl do it, she was wet between her legs. Her cunt was getting warm too, her mouth felt good. Her fingers were working her cunt as she sucked Robert, she thought it was the best sight she had ever seen. She sucked harder as she felt Robert's orgasm starting, she was sucking hard, fast and hard. She felt him swell even more and then he exploded into her mouth, a little more was released than the first time. He came a lot, he had never cum so hard in his life, this was just the first time he had ever cum in her mouth.</p> <p>With her pussy on fire, Edna had to be careful, her own fingers were working the pussy that had sucked up his cock, even though it was only a few minutes with Robert she felt the pussy she wished to give her husband. She looked up to Robert's face, his eyes were closed, and she smiled. She lifted her mouth from him and smiled, as he opened his eyes, Edna reached for her wet fingers, took them into her mouth, sucked on them. She smiled, licking them clean, she didn't think she could do that, but it was wonderful that she had not known she had tasted the cum of other men yet.</p> <p>They looked at one another for a moment, and Robert started to walk to the door and Edna stood up, still sitting on the lounger.</p> <p>"That was wonderful," Edna said, and they walked to the gate, back to their towels, he grabbed one as she reached for another towel, she turned.</p> <p>She saw that Robert was walking back over to the lounge chairs, his shorts sticking to his legs. It was time to turn around and go back to the pool, Edna smiled and turned her hair back.</p> <p>They did not see him again after that day, her friend had told her that she would have to tell him about it. Edna knew he was thinking about all of itâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
