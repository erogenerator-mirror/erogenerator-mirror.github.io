Spend not the remnant of thy days in thoughts and fancies concerning</h4><p><strong>other men, when it is not in relation to some common good, when by it thou art hindered from some other better work. That is, spend not thy time in</strong> that or else.</p> <p>"No, it is not what."</p> <p>"Yes, it is what?" She answered with her voice even more confident.</p> <p>He didn't let her keep that out of his thoughts this time but continued to give her a chance to explain the error of her ways or her own. She was still having trouble understanding him. It would be so easy to have already confessed to it.</p> <p>"I'm not fucking anybody in the middle of a wedding night. I'm fucking an ex. And I ain't a virgin anymore. I've been fucking somebody I've grown up with for some time. And I ain't never been fucked by anybody but the two of them from behind." His voice was getting more and more confident and he couldn't help but be proud as hell of that one.</p> <p>"So, is it you that you're fucking and not me?" She asked him.</p> <p>"Fuck, you know. It's the other way." he replied.</p> <p>"What's a good-looking man doing in your bed, when he's the one fucking you?" she demanded.</p> <p>"I'm not sure if your idea of a good fucking is a good fuck and fuck only if you're not doing it. The best fuck I've ever had was when I was a kid and my best friend's dad fucked me up the ass while I was sitting up in bed, when my parents were at work." He confessed. "I was fucked by two guys once before but I was never more careful. Even my best friend's dad fucked me up the ass again that night."</p> <p>"You really should have told your father that you were fucking me." she said. "After all, we're married!" she countered. She wasn't worried enough to take away if he was not going to fuck her but she wasn't worried. If he wasn't planning on screwing her anyway, she was. After all, he was going to be fucking her too.</p> <p>"I know. Don't worry." he insisted.</p> <p>For a minute, that seemed as if it was a lifetime. He was going to be fucking her too. But she wasn't going to tell him that. Then she added, her question still hard to swallow, if he was going to ask her to fuck him and fuck again. "Besides what I really meant was that I've never been fucked by anybody else. We're a swinging couple!"</p> <p>"That's right! That's the biggest fucking thing I've ever heard." he said. "I've fucked a bunch of girls already."</p> <p>"Did you ever fuck any of them?" she inquired.</p> <p>"Only once, on our first date." he replied. That was the answer that she expected him to say.</p> <p>"Why?" she asked him. "You're fucking all these women, how could a man not be fucking them or fucking any of them? It's too late for that! Now, why don't you let me explain it to you?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't want to think about it too much. Let's just keep our hands in the right places at the right times." he said, "But no matter what I do, if you're really interested, you can use the bed. We'll have plenty of time to make love again."</p> <p>"So am I interested tonight, don't I?" she demanded.</p> <p>"Don't worry. You were already." he assured her.</p> <p>"You can just fuck me anyway you like." she offered. She didn't care anymore if he wasn't happy about fucking the other way. She had just given him the excuse of having sex that she and her ex had been engaged in, as if she was a married woman in love with her husband. Then, the question came out of her mouth she couldn't help herself from thinking about all those cocksucking and facials her ex had given her and how they had filled her so full of cum and cum. Would her own cock be as big as hers anymore, if not wider?</p> <p>"You're not really fucking me because of me." he said. He wasn't really convinced that she was. But even as she was saying these things, she suddenly had no problem fucking a guy, since he was already taking the lead in the situation.</p> <p>"Just think, I already know you liked fucking me. Just know that I like to be fucked. I don't care if you know I like it!" she demanded.</p> <p>"You could have some fun with the others." he offered.</p> <p>"No. I can't," she responded.</p> <p>"Not with us. Besides, I could use the bed." he concluded his challenge.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>She had made it up. You are really, he already he had more than me too. We could use it. I mean it.
