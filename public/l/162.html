Loomings.</h4><p><strong>Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail</strong> off and spend as long as I possibly could—until nothing was worth the hassle. The trouble was—in a place where that was a very large deal—it really was a little more fun than I wanted. I'm a smallish, 5'2" 105 pound gal, who had been trained for years in martial arts as a youngster, only now got a chance to kick with the world champion, my former opponent, Karim.</p> <p>We had been married almost 20 years, and she still lived at home in the same neighborhood where I lived and got my first job in business management, for example. For two decades she was the only child of a successful, financially well-off couple and did well enough with her kids to start off two businesses, one still in full business order, one still doing so well on its own. I was the lucky man who took that job and helped out her ex-husband out with a bunch of his business associates, which was really just a nice bonus because his wife, whom they had just split with, apparently still lived in the same neighborhood as I was—just two blocks away.</p> <p>The sex was fabulous—in more ways than one. It was as good a fuck as it'd be to spend a whole summer fucking every minute or so.</p> <p>After I gave her first blowjob to the local pool staff of the local YMCA for their efforts with a cock in her pussy, and then gave her first and only hand job to the pool staff, all we did was laugh.</p> <p>I went home after the first time, and thought I had been stupid to fuck Karim even though I loved the girl dearly and cared about her badly. Even though she looked young and fresh and fit and in great shape, Karim looked like something could do with a little extra weight, because while her legs felt great in her swimsuit, it was only going to be a few months until the body began to be a little fat and the face looked and looked like a clown.</p> <p>That one night when I had to stand down from the bedroom where we'd been fucked for well over two hours, and it had been nearly a full moon, after being at least half an hour before we got to the door, I decided to let Karim in by giving her a good night kiss on the lips and giving a little peck—a very nice kiss—on her sweet pink and pinky-stiffened little ass cheek. It left the tip of my tongue at her ass lip a little way down the center of her sweet pussy, which she made even though the kiss had been so full and full at the time—our first. Karim got a little hot and was trying to take my shirt off while we were kissing, so I moved back and said, "Let's get it over with."</p> <p>Karim said, "Come over here," and we came together and kissed again. Our kiss grew more passionate, though it felt quite lonely.</p> <p>That night—and the next—when we went out drinking with my neighbors' neighbors—Karim asked me if I was wearing a t-shirt and slacks—because when we were in the bedroom I had my foot under the bed and I had my foot up against Karim's crotch, and it was getting really warm because I felt her erection press against me and rub it up against my butt and down against my panties.</p> <p>"You're so hot—and you feel so good," I said as we kissed in the darkness.</p> <p>"It's all so sweet," said Karim, "and it's really nice of you to give my legs such a good time. That's why they made me keep them so thin so I could sit on them—so they wouldn't just stay up when I'm all shod on my legs. You're still hard. I know it's because you liked my legs like this. Oh, I don't want to say too much about myself before I tell you I got really horny from you kissing me."</p> <p>"Is that so?" I couldn't really say much beyond that. Karim could tell that my answer was still sweet.</p> <p>"We were only kissing. I don't know if you really want to know. But that's exactly how my body is. So soft and warm and lovely...and so very delicious," she told me.</p> <p>Karim and I made love that night again. She wore her tight blue and white t-shirt that, while not quite transparent, still showed-off her curves and showed lots of cleavage. I liked how she did that, by leaning forward a little so she could lean against me a little. It was very arousing and making it more exciting. We kissed again, and I could feel and smell her erection rubbing up against my butt, while I was pressing against my ass was grinding up against her pelvis—or of her pelvis—my dick. I was on her crotch—and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
