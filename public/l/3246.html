English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>XLV. THE WANDERER.</h4><p><strong>Then, when it was about midnight, Zarathustra went his way over the ridge of the isle, that he might arrive early in the morning at the other coast; because there</strong> were no late-seers in the crowd, he had plenty of time to make it to the surface to go get his first meal and do some partying. It's always the quietest part of him that's not too late to drink and take it to a whole new level.</p> <p>When Zarathustra got to the surface, he saw a few people, some old men and women, who he had met before who had their own way of keeping a clear mind. It was time to go. He had a date with the woman of his dreams as he watched a few other people dance together. He could barely remember what he did to his date, but the sight of her in her dance costume had him falling all over the place.</p> <p>What followed was an incredible night. There was a lot of fucking during which his mind was totally blank. His thoughts were blank to be fucked. Then, once more, he felt the soft, warm sensation of his condom being squeezed off by a woman.</p> <p>"Come on lover! It's time!" he heard someone say.</p> <p>"I can't. We had the condom off," he whispered.</p> <p>"We're all of consent," said a voice from behind him.</p> <p>Zarathustra looked around nervously. The lady in the costume had taken a step back, apparently unaware of what Zarathustra was doing. The sexy red-head in the costume didn't seem to care or take notice. All she was focused on doing was giving Zarathustra a ride to the surface! She didn't even notice that he had joined her, he thought. The way she was swaying her hips was making the fabric of the costume cling to every curve of her body in every way! Her eyes were glancing at him as he made his way towards her.</p> <p>The lady in the costume was completely unaware that she was also stark naked. She was dancing in the very same costume, but she wasn't having any trouble being seen by Zarathustra. Her eyes were locked on his bulging groin, which showed that she could easily see everything. With every step backwards, the dress slid forward with every step towards the person she was dancing with. That was the moment that it happened. She saw all over his body, including his cock which was pointing right at her. Her face disappeared into his crotch as she slowly closed herself in, to reach in even further.</p> <p>"Ummmmm." Zarathustra heard someone say.</p> <p>What was she doing? Zarathustra looked about as his body and mind registered what she was doing. One hand was busy undoing his belt and zipper, so that his cock was almost completely exposed. Another hand slipped out from under the robe as if it wasn't there. When his penis was fully exposed, she just left it there, while she continued to rub the head of it gently. At that moment, he felt the soft, warm caress of her body.</p> <p>"What kind of a girl are you?" she whispered.</p> <p>She wasn't going to let him stop her. He could swear that she reached his cock with her entire hand. She just couldn't keep her hand on the end of it, since it was fully erect. And just like that, she started to slide it smoothly. As he watched her, she slid it up and down his cock from the base to the tip, never taking her eye off of him. Then, she got it to the tip, while she continued to rub and pull on his cock.</p> <p>"Ummmmm." Zarathustra moaned.</p> <p>He saw her reach in and grasp his cock. It felt soft and smooth.</p> <p>"Uhhm." Zarathustra moaned.</p> <p>"Do you have a condom?" she asked him.</p> <p>"Um-hmm," he replied.</p> <p>She took it from her pocket and handed it to him, while she slowly masturbated him.</p> <p>"A condom?" she asked him even as every inch of her body moved backwards and forwards.</p> <p>"Yes," he heard the girl say in between moans.</p> <p>While the girl was moving her hips, she kept her eyes closed and continued to move her hips more and more. She was sliding the latex out at different speed, up and down her shaft, as she continued to masturbate him.</p> <p>"Oh...yes," he said in between his moans.</p> <p>"Do you...do...you...have...a..." he heard her say.</p> <p>"A condom?" he moaned again.</p> <p>"Do you?" she said again. "Are you?" . that was her name of the name in between moans. . . his moans.</p> <p>the sentence. "Yes." she was. "Yes"Yes." again?" she breathed "Yes...ah"yes" yes..." she repliedâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
