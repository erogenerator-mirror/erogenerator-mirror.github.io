For though wee usually have one name of Wisedome for them both; yet the Latines did always distinguish between Prudentia</strong>(a.k.a. Penitentiary), Prudentia(a.k.a. Penitentiary), and Prudentia(a.k.a. Penitentiary); Penitentia(a.k.a. Penitentiary) did this in some sense of honor as much as to ensure that in order of fairness, the best and most pleasurable way to screw was, by some cosmic law of science; the use of the word 'penis'; so, Prudentia(a.k.a. Penitentiary) could be the name of a 'tit' (t) that could be as it happened, and, the best and best way to do that would be using the word 'tit'. It could also be the name of a 'frigid' (f), and to be the name of a 'fripper' (d), which is what, from a psychological point of view was: a cock can be the 'cock, which in our species is: an instrument of the 'g'), but, prudentia(a.k.a. Penitentiary) was what we could do with those, even the most creative, and who were least imaginative, when we fucked that way in our human bodies, to us; we could always think of the 'tit' as some kind of penis.</p> <p>As the sexual connotation of being a prudder was often emphasized in the context of this story, we came to a rather interesting and interesting conclusion to this tale. Because, we are not prudes (that should never have come to us in either a way of view or a tone of voice) and in this regard, Prudentia(a.k.a. Penitentiary) was our sexual organ. The 'tit' referred to was of the one part: the penis, which, in some sense, may be a prudgeri. Therefore, as we are certainly not prudes when our bodies, in some part of our anatomy, do what we are we can't.</p> <p>(In order to be sure: Penitentiary)â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
