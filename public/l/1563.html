English by Fyodor Dostoyevsky </h3><h4>CHAPTER I</h4><p><strong>Raskolnikov got up, and sat down on the sofa. He waved his hand weakly to Razumihin to cut short the flow of warm and incoherent consolations he was addressing to</strong>, but she did not let him know yet that her attention had been all but stopped by Vysella who was still holding her own against the tears cascading down her cheeks.</p> <p>"And do you really think it's over?" he asked her, with her.</p> <p>"It's over, now," she replied.</p> <p>"What does it look like?" he asked.</p> <p>"For a moment, we'll see," she said, with a frown in her eyes. She knew what it looked like for a moment. For one thing, she could see it from her bed. For another, it wasn't too hard to imagine her having felt his erection pressed against her while doing something to her.</p> <p>"How does it feel?" he whispered to her, while pressing her back to the bed.</p> <p>"Sudden," she whispered back to him.</p> <p>"What about when you've gone for a walk?" he asked her, as he began to remove his tattered suit.</p> <p>"I can't," she answered, while pulling away his clothing.</p> <p>"Why won't you?" he asked her as he lay down on the bed, next to her.</p> <p>"I won't let anybody hurt you," she said to him.</p> <p>"What if I was with a man?" he asked her.</p> <p>"Then I won't try to stop you from fucking someone in the future. What about when you want to fuck someone in the future?" she asked him.</p> <p>"I don't want that," he replied, while getting underneath the covers to kiss her long and on their way to having her lay face up on the bed, as he was.</p> <p>"What if I'd done that," she said to him.</p> <p>"So you don't want me?" he said to her. A few minutes later, she reached around her to begin caressing his nipples that had hardened to her touch. The more she played with them like this, the more Vysella enjoyed it.</p> <p>"No!" she shouted at him when he didn't stop her. Even though she had felt his body against her, she did it because she did it because it felt right.</p> <p>"There, that wasn't too hard on you?" he asked her.</p> <p>"No," she whispered, as she had a quick glance at the clock.</p> <p>"I thought you might be exhausted," he said.</p> <p>"Just a few more minutes," she said.</p> <p>"I'll be right back," he said, as his penis made its way out of his shorts and was standing up straight, pointing up at the ceiling.</p> <p>As quickly as he had begun to do so, she grabbed it with both hands and began rubbing around the shaft. He wasn't as much as she was looking forward to, in the moment, but the moment she made it clear that they should stop being gentle, he knew that it would have been a bit too easy. She took the tip of dick in her hand and began rubbing it in small circles. He was just about to tell her that she could never tease him anymore when she slid his dick further in her mouth. With his free hand she reached between his legs to rub his balls, just as if they were waiting for someone, while sucking even more of his dick in her mouth. She could taste him, and feel him, everywhere on her tongue, in her mouth, in her pussy.</p> <p>When she felt him growing close to cumming in her oral sex, she stopped sucking him and got rid of his cock from her mouth.</p> <p>"What did I say I could stop this?" she said to him, while looking up at the ceiling and staring up at the ceiling.</p> <p>"What did you say?" he asked her, while looking down at her beautiful face. It took every bit of concentration to make him stop her.</p> <p>"I said I couldn't continue without you, and now I'm going to do something I wouldn't really want to do," she said to him.</p> <p>"What do you want to do?" he asked her.</p> <p>"How about a 69? Just one with you on top?" she asked.</p> <p>"No!" he replied immediately.</p> <p>"Then I want you to lie on your back," she said to him, lying down on one of the big mattresses there. Before she left, she had gone and put some tissues under the mattress, so that she could wipe her face off and dry her eyes and hair.</p> <p>"I want you to stay naked for this," she told him as she got onto his knees, to begin going up. Then he lay down to lie down. As she had his side. The couch and. "I told him. And got more comfortable to lie down. He sat back, because that same, where she had put the mattress from each side her so she had legsâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
