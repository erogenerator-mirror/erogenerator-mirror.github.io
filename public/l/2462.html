She leaned toward him at the same time she did, their mouths meeting, tongues meeting, nipples clashing, and lips smacking.</p> <p>Mason was completely aroused by his body; that first time with a man had definitely been a great thrill.</p> <p>It was as if the physical intimacy had taken over his thoughts, as his heart had gone pounding in his chest. He felt the tightness of her body against him, felt the way her heart seemed to skip a beat at every single stroke as their skin slid together in pleasure.</p> <p>As if it were possible to make love as a whole without wanting the moment to end, so in the end he did too. He wanted more. More than anything he felt in his life.</p> <p>"I see you have an admirer, Mason," she told him. And now it was time he did just that.</p> <p>His lips moved down her neck and his tongue swiped across her nipple, tasting the salty sweat and skin of those hard cocks. He moved his right hand down her torso, over her abdomen, to her pussy where his fingertips slipped inside. His two middle fingers slid over her moist skin as his thumb rubbed against her clit. She was squirming, moaning, her fingers clutching his hair and her body writhing.</p> <p>His mouth left her nipple long enough to draw on to her other nipple as he dipped between her legs to lick and suck that sensitive skin that was the most intimate part of her anatomy. Oh god. She was so wet. She tasted all over him and knew she was ready to be fucked. She wanted to feel his hard shaft slide inside her, even if it were so very wrong for him to be inside her. It had always been his fantasy to have sex with another man. He had fantasized about being so fucking hard inside her pussy, but he wasn't really sure if he wanted to have it done.</p> <p>The thought made him want her.</p> <p>"You know you are the one that should be here," he said.</p> <p>"Yes, Mason."</p> <p>For she had an answer to his question.</p> <p>The words were out of place when he reached down and grasped her. She had her back to him as she felt the pressure of the other man's fingers spreading the moisture between them. She didn't move, which made it even more enticing.</p> <p>Kneeling in front of her; Mason kissed her mouth, her neck and finally her breasts. She responded so well. He pulled her up to him, kissing her lips again and again while his hands kneaded her firm ass as his lips pressed against her breasts.</p> <p>Her eyes were closed as she felt him move his fingers up and down her wet slit, feeling the heat and wetness of her pussy as his warm tongue found the hard nub hidden beneath the hood and began to play. Mason moved his tongue across her hardened button, circling, circling, licking, and then slipping inside its moist cavern. She leaned into him, closing her legs around the other man's legs behind her, drawing his face closer to her.</p> <p>Her own hips began thrusting against him as he continued to eat her and drive her desire upward to an even level. For there was no other way. She knew it. He knew it if he didn't push her legs back a little to bring his cock into contact with her pussy. She was on fire, and she was wet enough. If his cock had been so easily slipped inside her pussy, then she wasn't so damn wet.</p> <p>Her eyes snapped open as she felt his hardness against her and then her eyes went wide as he thrust into her then lifted her hips high in the air and began to fuck her with the length of his cock. She felt something new and new as he brought her to a place from which she had never been. The head of his cock was buried deep and she was sure it would just stay there, just feel it within her and not feel anything.</p> <p>A moan started somewhere inside her as he moved his body into a different place, rubbing his cock head against her. She opened her mouth to let out a gasp of pleasure as he slipped inside her again and then lifted her hips once more so he could fuck her without hurting her. Her eyes were wide as he lifted her body once more, thrusting into her, his tongue moving within her, licking and penetrating inside her. Her and tasting her. The sweetness he felt. She had been ready to cum a million times but didn't even when she had been ready until he had been ready. It may never was when she didâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
