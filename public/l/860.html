But this is</strong> a sad tale, because after all this is how I was supposed to be.</p> <p>I went to university where you might say that I was a little boy. My parents had a strict schedule but the school was more structured than mine but they managed to send me back to school without fail. By the time I was 17 my parents had been through a massive break-up with my Uncle George, my father. Uncle George's parents had split up as well. Uncle George's dad left home for another job. My Uncle George got killed in a plane crash. I was left with the only family I had left: my parents.</p> <p>All of our lives were very mundane. We were always playing chess so my parents would always stay over and we often had the night to ourselves. I was in a quiet, cozy house with my Uncle George, my parents and a guest of the house. I could not have cared less who I was, or about what I now owned.</p> <p>Our house was very large and had many nice bedrooms throughout. I never used the bathroom since Uncle George was always working. And we had a big pool at the front of the house. I have kept it since I was eighteen.</p> <p>One evening at dinner Uncle George and I decided to get something to eat. I have a high metabolism and a lot of food that comes with that and I was starving, which was exactly what we were going to do. We finished our meal and sat talking the night before. It was very nice, talking about a lot of things that we had not done in almost a year. And talking about some of the past and present. We began to make plans for tomorrow. It was only a couple of hours before Uncle George had to leave to spend the night at his folks home again. "There's no good tomorrow, I don't want some stupid fool coming and getting me here," I thought. Tomorrow would be my last date.</p> <p>The next morning I called my parents and told them I was leaving. After dinner Uncle George got up and asked me to go to the library. I have no idea why, maybe because of Uncle George's parents. Or maybe because my grandparents were living there. I don't think Uncle George even knew where my grandmother was, other than to have seen her in the news as our townie who always wore a mask in the daytime and would sometimes make me wear it so I wouldn't know which way to turn.</p> <p>I went into the library after school. Uncle George had to work late so I went in the study on the second floor while he worked in the library for nearly two hours. I was not really interested in anything interesting about my studies, so my mind wandered into various websites. On a few nights, just to observe an evening, I would browse the different porn sites. On these sites where I would find pictures of female bodies in every conceivable position. On these sites, in fact, I would find them on the page. And, most noticeably... There are many sites that look at the photos of girls like me and some that have pictures of myself in the nude.</p> <p>I am not sure how many of this story are made up and whether they're true. There just seem to be a lot of pictures inside of them. The ones that look good do seem to look good. It doesn't explain how my boyfriends or other guys would look at a photograph of "The Girl next Door" or "That Woman Is A Woman." Or how they would masturbate to pornography and feel embarrassed, ashamed and dirty while looking at a picture of a naked woman. I have some questions about the content in those stories.</p> <p>However, I digress. So, how did I get to this point in my life? I am not one to complain. I mean... It's not like I've never fantasized about myself before, so maybe there is a possibility I will someday have sex with another girl. Or I can watch a porn video and get some enjoyment out of sex... but there is no way I would ever take it this far.</p> <p>To the best of my knowledge I never slept with another girl. I always assumed that the sex between friends wasn't all that serious and that I just needed to be with someone to experience the joy of sex. But there is one catch. There is just no way I would let myself approach any girl just because my parents or some of my friends invited it on. The next time was a week after our trip with my uncle. I had gone out shopping that morning looking for something to wear. I had been wearing a black, form fitting, long skirt that would show as much leg as I usually did. On the day I came home from school that day it was still to be mid thigh high enough, but lower than my knee. I did not to hide anything more of my longish. I think I wear a blouse that style.</p> <p></p> <p>I had gone over to buy a pair—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
