Hast thou reason? I have. Why then makest thou not use of it? For if</h4><p><strong>thy reason do her part, what more canst thou require?</strong></p> <p>And he was right. This was the best fuck I'd ever had in my whole life, with my first partner, and two more in the next.</p> <p>"God you're right... I know we can't seem to get enough of that, baby," she told me as they moved to kiss once more.</p> <p>We kissed briefly, passionately, in silence until she broke the spell.</p> <p>"Damn man, I can't help myself when I'm with you today!" she announced.</p> <p>I smirked and got out of bed. I walked towards my bedroom, taking with me our usual quick walk to the bed.</p> <p>"I still want to fuck you," she told me after a moment to allow her to enter my home. And I kissed her, my tongue finding hers as our kiss deepened. Before long we had a raging heat building inside of both of us.</p> <p>"I have to fuck you, too!" I declared as she slid her hands onto me.</p> <p>"Take me, now!" she ordered me.</p> <p>And I took her roughly. It was our first time together and now this had to be our first time alone together.</p> <p>We moved to the bed, kissing and fondling each other all the way. We moved on to the bed and I lay beside her, our mouths locked again as we undulated slowly against each other. I could taste her and smell her arousal when we kissed, and it made my body all tingly all over and caused me to want her more than I thought I did. As I kissed her neck, she ran her fingers through my hair, pulling me closer towards her. The scent of her, which had been everywhere all evening, began to grow stronger as she moaned low in her throat as our tongues began to circle her neck.</p> <p>"Hang on a sec," I thought to myself.</p> <p>I didn't know how much longer it would take me to do this, so I broke the kiss and let her lie back, her hands going to my hair.</p> <p>She ran her index finger through my hair, making my body hot and the tingles running down my spine once again. She pulled my mouth down onto hers with her fingers and began sucking on them.</p> <p>I felt my nipples harden and become erect. I knew I was turned on. As she continued, I sucked a nipple into herself. I had been aroused from watching her with the guys many times before, even more recently than she had been.</p> <p>She moaned as her body suddenly exploded in pleasure.</p> <p>As she pulled me to her, she began to move her fingers to my pussy. We kissed once more as she plunged her fingers inside of me, moving them in and out.</p> <p>"God, are you so wet!" she moaned, her head moving closer, "I love watching you."</p> <p>"Mmm, I love you, too," I told her honestly.</p> <p>We began kissing some more, her fingers moving inside of me, her fingers moving over my clit, rubbing and rubbing it until my body was ready to climax again.</p> <p>"Mmm... I want to feel you come for me... Now," she urged me.</p> <p>She was on her back now, her legs wide apart as far as they could go, her hands spreading her lips apart as she began to slide three fingers inside of her, her other hand holding her breast, tugging, rubbing and pulling on her hard nipple before moving her fingers and hand in long strokes over my clit.</p> <p>Her body twitched and quivered as she began to come, her juices flowing onto her fingers as she moaned deeply and deeply again.</p> <p>As her wetness continued to cover my fingers and hand, it almost slipped in my face.</p> <p>"Mmm..." I said as the feelings of that incredible feeling came back to me.</p> <p>It was then that I realized the taste of her on my fingers. I was going to have to taste it laterâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
