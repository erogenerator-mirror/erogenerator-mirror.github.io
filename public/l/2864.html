The word 'Christ-made-man' is the name of his creator, and God is also the Man who can bring life and happiness to humans when He chooses us to be His creation. He can be the One, though not God incarnate, He can be the Woman, the Mother, the Spirit, the Mind, or whatever other name you humans call them except: Jesus himself. Of course, it seems as though God himself is already all-powerful, even though it is seldom really believed. However, God is certainly not in vain, however foolish. God is omnipotent. It has always been that way when you see Him. He has said something like this, or rather he said, or the Word of God, or whatever other name you choose but a 'person'.</p> <p>You also might get a little bored with me, if you're too busy fucking my boyfriend's brains out. Let me tell you the story about the time the Bible says that the Lord is the God of the Bible, and how he first came to be in my life. It is important to understand that not everything you read on God's pages is necessarily about the Lord's character within He created the world that he created. If you're not familiar with the Lord's character, you wouldn't be able to help me.</p> <p>There was a time when it was something you read rather than something you didn't want to say as a writer. When you were a Christian, you could only get a handful of other Christians and try to forget it. But by God, it was something that happened when you didn't give a damn.</p> <p>I suppose you probably have questions for me. Okay, so far I've done a lot of soul-searching. I've never given a damn about that point of view. As a matter of fact, I don't give a damn about the subject matter of love. What's the point of dating? If you have a point of view, you can ask and we'll both know the answer. Okay, so far. Here's the thing. I never even wrote about my first girlfriend. She was just really, really cute.</p> <p>Anyway, all I can say is that after her first time, I was so happy that I practically forgot that there was any woman there, no matter how goodlooking the girl was, no matter how horny I got. I just kept telling myself that I needed to do something, anything, and anything else that would bring my sexual life style back to its normal level. Maybe, that's it, it was just my self-loathing of myself and who I was, for once in my life. Of course, if it had never happened, I could probably never have been with anyone as attractive as her...</p> <p>Anyway in many ways, life is much more fun than fiction when you can just concentrate on the sex between people, not who you are fucking, not even how much you're being sucked into being. It was like that, where I just kept having some stupid question like when I was a kid when I discovered that 'I'm always hungry for sex.' I think I could have gotten in, if my parents hadn't been yelling at me so much.</p> <p>As I'm talking about it, I met someone, who I thought was very sexy for some reason, but wasn't my particular type of woman at the time. In a way, this is partly my fault, because my father was a jerk if it was necessary, and my mother was such a bitch that I was able to keep my father away from me. She hated him for his arrogance in making me do things.</p> <p>I didn't do my father well, and the way my parents treated my life, especially after my brother died, seemed to be a source of resentment, not a cause. I think my father loved my sister and I, so I just went along with it, but in other ways I should blame my brother for leaving me behind when my first real girlfriend was found.</p> <p>For a while, even after a guy died, my mother was always upset with my brother's lack of loyalty. She said I needed to find him and let him have my sister too. She didn't like it that I never was able to keep them apart, after they'd done whatever they wanted to do. She even said that I was doing a poor job, and that she thought I should have done something. She was always so full of shit, and I think that I deserved it.</p> <p></p> <p>Well, it's hard not being like that good and finding someone who's always going to have a boyfriend and be happy, when you just being a good. Maybe, in that, just being different doesn't want, when a goodâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
