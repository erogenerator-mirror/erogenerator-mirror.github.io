English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>XI. THE NEW IDOL.</h4><p><strong>Somewhere there are still peoples and herds, but not with us, my brethren: here there are states. A state? What is that? Well! open now your ears unto me, for</strong> the time of these, you must listen now!" (1)</p> <p>"Yes, of course."</p> <p>"Come join the others."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"No. Now the people! Now you must obey me. You must keep your mind clear on your actions, your thoughts!"</p> <p>"Yes!"</p> <p>"All is lost in the knowledge of your body! Do you not want to obey me?"</p> <p>"Yes." There's that word again! "Yes!"</p> <p>"Now! This is how you should be doing it! Open your eyes your eyes!"</p> <p>"Oh! Oh! Are we getting ahead of ourselves?"</p> <p>"Let me remind you again!"</p> <p>"Yes!"</p> <p>"Your breasts! Oh, my boobs! Yes! Are they nice?"</p> <p>"Yes, they're lovely. Oh, my."</p> <p>"Then let me teach you!"</p> <p>"Oh yes!"</p> <p>"Now, your waist, now you can just take your panties down."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Then, let your cock free. Let him touch you!"</p> <p>"Oh yes."</p> <p>"You feel as if he's touching your breasts, your vagina. He's touching you!"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Now, let him see the tip of your cock. Tell him how it feels. You can tell me if he enjoys the sight. When he takes his hand away, it's a lovely sight!" (2)</p> <p>"My penis feels wonderful in his hand."</p> <p>"It must be. It's lovely to be touched there." It's hard to describe it with words, but I can try. If it's hard to describe it, it has to be for us all. "You're hard from his hands on your body." (3)</p> <p>"Yes!" (4)</p> <p>"You're lovely! It feels as if you're trying to stay hard as you can. Can you stand up a little?"</p> <p>"Yes, I can."</p> <p>"I want to see your penis. I want to put it into his hands. Tell me now!"</p> <p>"All is lost. I don't know how. It seems strange that I've not realized how much is lost in my head and how little is still to be. I haven't had such clear thought about it since yesterday afternoon." I was surprised at myself for speaking like that. It must be true! All is gone, and now I've had a clear idea that I've not been as hard as I thought. Oh, I don't know if that's possible! But I want to feel his penis in my hand because it's not lost in my head. I want to be able to see that his head is still visible. I want to push it into him with my fingers. I want to see his cock in his hand! I want him to tell me how long he's wanted to feel my touch!</p> <p>"His penis is very hard. It's not as big as yours. I can feel him, and it feels good, but I still can't make comparisons. He's got his own penis! Oh no! He'll not feel this good! Is this better?"</p> <p>"Oh yes. He's not as strong as your father."</p> <p>"Then he's not nearly as good as mine. He'll be quite weak if he doesn't enjoy his first experience."</p> <p>"But I don't think we'll see you again. It can't be that difficult for him."</p> <p>"It's not difficult to see him. It's hard to see him in an embrace as he does the same on my body when I take my panties down, and he can see your cock in my body and on my tits!"</p> <p>What was that? I hadn't realized how much I'd had thought about it. I wasn't quite sure if I should let his penis in my body; I can't tell him whether what I'm doing is normal, or something more dangerous. I'm getting ahead. Time to stop! I'm not like that. It's only fair that he finds out what the other has got to do, and then that's all it will take to make him lose any respect for me. I can't think. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to think. I'm getting ahead.</p> <p>"Are his hands on your waist! Do you feel that the waist of your briefs is missing? This underwear should have a better feel! It'll come all the way off!"</p> <p>"I'm not like my father!" Andi's comments. I didn't agree. This was always wearing underwear, always with his, never having. I've never felt like mine. Not like my own, but him, never felt my own, his cock always. Always. But now I felt, own, evenâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
