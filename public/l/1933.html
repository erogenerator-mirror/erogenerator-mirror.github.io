Not vegetative spiration, it is not surely (which plants have) that</h4><p><strong>in this life should be so dear unto us; nor sensitive respiration, the proper life of beasts, both tame and wild; nor this our imaginative faculty; nor that we are</strong> at our deepest inclination, we in every sense are only humans; though in that they are like us, it is we at all; who to us is the least in both our life: we are the closest, though not in every conceivable place, to such in each other; for even we are alike in one another, though there are ways of expressing we are different, for us both a species, an alien creature; and of course we are both like us in our passion; which we have never in all of our lives attempted to do; yet both our penises, which we have in ourselves were as small as their penises were, are only small, like human dicks, a small pair, but a thing of which we are proud of, and very curious to know what it is to feel a man enter my vagina, to feel my body respond instantly, as it would if the organ itself had a mind of it's own and a heart had a heart of its own; and like all animals, if I could give myself so completely and totally to a man, as I do to him; it should be a special gift, not all the other gifts do. The moment I would have to yield myself, for he may very well want to enter me for a long time to come, until his organ becomes a cock, and as far as he can keep it a little longer on me, it might not happen yet; but he needs to be sure; and there is no way to make any difference.</p> <p>So there I was, lying there next to a naked man and kissing away his hair; our lips were touching. He was no longer touching me like before, his arms were around my body, he was still kissing me; but as our passion grew, the kisses became deeper and more fervent, and in some of our ardor we were kissing with the desire that the very act of kissing could provide, to express our mutual lust for each other. When in one thing it was such as it had been before, in a whole world, it was as though we had been brought together; this was not a mere act of fucking; this was so like the love and pleasure that all of its many forms of touching could bring, all the intimate parts of ourselves, especially the penis between our legs, were connected. The feeling of the moment, when in which it was only the one, as we were both still kissing, was almost more than I could bear.</p> <p>He was still kissing me; so much passion in that which we were at this moment. My lips were against his cheek, then my chin, his chin, his neck; his chin lay on my breast, his chest; as his hand was still caressing me and my nipple. The sensation of his hand on me was a new thrill, the first real sensation of another man's touch on me, and there it was, the sensation of his fingers holding me; as I felt the hardness of his penis against my nipple; it was all that I could do not to moan like that.</p> <p>He kept his hands on me, and moved closer to me. Our kissing, as it continued on with our kisses, were more passionate now, the kind of kisses of love that the lovers share every moment that is spent together, and our lips were touching as we were, which we had never done before, so intimate yet. Our lips became more and more insistent; as he moved closer, our hands became more and more urgent in caressing each other.</p> <p>I felt his penis pressing against my thigh, felt his hands on me, and suddenly I felt him move so close, so hard, to me there, and in the moment of our mouths meeting, as the first time in so long an age, I felt a fire as though from a single light to each and every molecule of skin, and I felt a great shock of love, as though the only feelings I could feel were his hot, strong body, and the intense sexual heat generated by it, the one that only our lips and genitals could bring.</p> <p>I had already thought about making love again, with him, but then I thought more on the other pleasures I had always imagined that I would enjoy, and how I had always been asexual being; I guess that there was more to it than that. When he had kissed me first with his fingers touching me, his kisses on me, and when I had kissed him myself, the way he had kissed me that first time, the first time he had used his mouth on me, the first time that his kisses brought on my ardor. I felt his penis, hard and pulsing like a large organ in my hand, and I was about to feel it again. His lips continued their kissing, and feeling just as we had done moments before, and it was like he had done, to kiss me, I wondered just as we had done to each other men to each other way to each other, in our desires, andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
