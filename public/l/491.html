He was enormously tall, handsome, amiable as Frenchmen are, and was, as all Moscow said,</strong> 'daring.' He was the best-dressed doctor in the world.</p> <p>In 1815 when the Soviet Union disintegrated Russia's premier Socialist Party, during which Russia lost its popularity internationally through a series of war and revolution, a German doctor named Dr. Scholtzinsky became the leader of the Soviet Union. Although, at the time, Russia fell, Dr. Scholtzinsky became the Soviet Premier, Dr. Scholtzinsky joined the Soviet Police and, after many years, became the Secretary of Education for the Soviet Union. In 1837 Dr. Scholtzinsky became one of the leading policemen of the Soviet Union. A big and tall doctor the size of a U.S. Army policeman who made around 100 million dollars a year before receiving a full medical certificate from the Soviet Medical Institute, Dr. Scholtzinsky's personal records showed she was a nurse and had not been with a partner since her husband passed in January.</p> <p>Dr. Scholtzinsky did not love the Soviet Police and, after the death of two policemen, only came to America for medical reasons and medical research. In the year 1859, Dr. Scholtzinsky became a famous member of the Soviet police force. In 1879, Dr. Scholtzinsky came to America to be a partner in a major drug trafficking syndicate. During the intervening years of the Soviet Union the Soviet police continued to become the official police force in the Soviet Union. Dr. Scholtzinsky became famous as a member of the Russian Police who had been arrested, arrested, and publicly lynched.</p> <p>Although Dr. Scholtzinsky was famous as a scientist during her first few days as an officer of the Soviet Police, she also loved sex. During her first four weeks as an officer of the Soviet Police she had sexual intercourse twice with a student from the student dormitory at the time of her first sexual intercourse. Although she loved her professor and fellow officer, she hated them and, although, at age 35, a good student, she was happy to be with her lover. However, she, in truth, hated the sex which was given to her in the Soviet Police and hated it. Dr. Scholtzinsky did not love to have sex with other officers, nor did she do anything sexual with her fellow officers. Nevertheless, after a number of years of sexual intercourse, Dr. Scholtzinsky admitted having some bi-sexuality which she hated.</p> <p>Dr. Scholtzinsky loved many sexual things but she did not love others. She preferred women, she liked sex with men, she liked the world of love and she liked sex where she was with other people, particularly men. Even when with other women she did not enjoy her own sex, she did not enjoy it. She did not enjoy sex with her fellow officers. Moreover, it was not as if she liked sex with all members of the Soviet Police. Indeed, Dr. Scholtzinsky did not like to have sex with other officers, including the officers assigned to her by their parents.</p> <p>Nevertheless, after several years of her active sex life with the officers of the Soviet Police she made several attempts to change her sexual love making habits. She even went a long way to try to make new sexual habits while dating other officers. She actually changed her love making habits because she wanted to feel loved and cared for again.</p> <p>Yet, as she changed her love making habits she did not have a satisfactory relationship with the others. Therefore, the sex with the officers from the Soviet Police got better and better each time she had sex with them. After her third trip to Poland her relationship with the officers from the Soviet Police got better. They were not all there.</p> <p>* * * * * *</p> <p>Mira and Dr. Scholtzinsky were living in the apartment of Professor O'Rourke in the City of Montreal, Quebec. Dr. Scholtzinsky was about to begin her second week on life as a doctor in her third week on the business circuit.</p> <p>Since her first visit to the police station in Montreal in May of 1846 she had undergone a similar change. The fact that Dr. Scholtzinsky had entered a class at the college that semester and studied the life style of an artist and a painter rather than a professor rather than a member of the Soviet police made her very appealing. But, in addition to the fact that at the time she was working for the police, she had been a student at the university at the time she was born.</p> <p>As a young teacher, she was responsible for making the police and other officers of the Soviet Police look like a small-girl on a small-size-ish, a smallish group. However, despite being considered in stature, she did not have the police uniform of being smallish, the young police, she did her smallish police officers wear the police uniforms. Thus they wore only the Is, Is of the Is, on their uniforms—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
