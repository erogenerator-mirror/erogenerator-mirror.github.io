Her father, captivated by youth</strong>, was one of the few who saw her as a threat. And for the first time in their marriage, he wasn't willing to sacrifice his marriage for one of his own.</p> <p>With no more convincing than that, she gave in to the passion and took his cock into her mouth. It was a long, warm mouth that made it possible for him to experience every square inch of her mouth and throat. They spent an hour or so with her holding his cock in her mouth until he was aching for her to stop and start sucking it again. She took his length into her throat again and again. "I love to suck a cock," she said, "and as long as you don't have a problem fucking me, you can do anything you want to me." The thought of getting the two of them off made Mr. Williams crazy with desire. Her warm wet mouth felt great and felt wonderful against his cock. It had been so long since the last time he had any one else to touch and feel. Her mouth was warm and felt fantastic. He hadn't been able to keep his hands off her and he squeezed her breasts roughly. The only thing he wanted more than doing that two or more times was to get a hand job from her. "Oh no! You're not doing that!" he cried. He was trying to grab the back of her head and prevent her from moving too fast, but her hands flew around the shaft he was trying to push into her. "You can do that! But you're going to end up fucking my mouth with your cock anyway. Why don't you help me?"</p> <p>Elizabeth didn't know what to do. She couldn't do anything. She looked at her husband. She knew what to do. He couldn't be a good husband for fucking her. But he wanted to fuck her, so that, even if she stopped him, he wouldn't want her to stop him. She would do whatever Mr. Williams wanted. If he made her do it, at least if she couldn't resist it, then he wouldn't have to make her do it for it. The thought made her so horny, so wet, that she almost came without him touching her.</p> <p>He didn't try to stop her. His dick was as stiff as it could get and it felt good sliding into her mouth. It was so hard to keep hold of it with her hands around the shaft. Once, Mr. Williams had had a hand job from one of the young girls on his yacht and her boyfriend had had a hand job from her the other day at the hotel in the Bahamas. But that wasn't a blow-job, for she thought it was just a girl hand that was too young to give a hand job to any straight guy. She was so naïve. And when she felt him press his cock into her mouth, she knew it wasn't a boy she was sucking. She wasn't sucking her boyfriend's cock. Mr. Williams really, really wanted to fuck her, so he wanted her to suck him. So to be able to let her suck his cock was the best thing he could do. He would have to do this every night with her being unable to resist.</p> <p>He wanted to feel her naked body and see what had been hidden under her clothes. For a long time, he imagined taking off her clothes and slipping back into bed with her. It was a fantasy, and one that his cock didn't belong to. It belonged to someone he loved. That person, who loved the sex, not the other way around. Not a real person who he loved the sex with. He imagined that he was going to tell her how much he loved her, and show her some of the things he loved with her, and would do to her if he could, with her permission. That would be the best thing he could do for her; the only thing.</p> <p>But she only continued to suck Mr. Williams's dick. It was his fantasy, wasn't it? Well in practice, it could be done.</p> <p>When the third time, she did it, it was for him. She felt great and felt good. She knew he was getting excited, but there was more to it than just the blow-job sucking. She had never done anything like that before. The whole fucking thing had been wrong. She should be repulsed; she should be disgusted; everything was wrong, but it only turned her on more. The things they had done, they were wrong. She hated the way she had gotten caught. She had let him see her in a state of disrepair. She hated it when he had to touch her. She had a crush on him. It made her realize her own desires, not just of fucking, but of fucking and sucking others as well as she did. She couldn't admit that she had feelings towards him. She had just liked the feel herself when she was sucked off. Even better than her daughter, not just now.
