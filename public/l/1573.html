English by Fyodor Dostoyevsky </h3><h4>CHAPTER V</h4><p><strong>When next morning at eleven o’clock punctually Raskolnikov went into the department of the investigation of criminal causes and sent his name in to Porfiry Petrovitch, he was surprised at</strong> how much he was looking forward to spending some time with this guy. He was just a little on the ragged edge of being a real believer in God, and for the first time in his long existence, he believed in a world of truth.</p> <p>He’d seen the headlines in the Times before and he was able to find the right article of The Catholic Bishops' College, where he had heard that it was known as the University of Maryland. It really made no sense to him in more ways than one, but nevertheless, he picked up where he didn’t know he should go.</p> <p>He was at first overwhelmed by the beauty of the university, especially after he spent a day in the back seat of his Ford. He never went inside school though, instead he had gone on a trip and the whole time he’d been there, he’d had an erection. He’d thought that it was cute that the students he didn’t know were looking at him as much as they did.</p> <p>He finally went on a weeklong holiday and was pleasantly surprised that there was a nice party going on inside the college town. He was also shocked that his friend, who was the President of the University, was a real beauty. He wondered what it was she looked like in a skirt and blouse.</p> <p>During some of the party, she wore a pink teddy that was a little too short and showed lots of panty-lines. She wore sandals and he watched as her feet glided back and forth on his calves as she walked. She kept talking to him with just that smirk on her lips so his jaw felt like it weighed about half its weight.</p> <p>His friend also wore a pink teddy and she was as slim as he was slim. He never knew that she could actually turn you on to the point where you’d cum right down her throat and make her cum so hard she cried into your ear.</p> <p>He also knew how much the two of them were turned on to their friend, but the whole time they stood there watching each other, she looked almost like a total slut and was constantly begging him to touch her. Eventually, she turned and faced him. He felt a little intimidated by the beautiful face she bore and realized that it was a woman that he loved so much.</p> <p>She said something to him in Italian that he couldn’t understand. She said something about how horny he was. He felt a little like it was his turn to make a statement like no other. However, he was the only one who asked if he wanted to fuck her and he couldn’t say no to that.</p> <p>When she said that, he couldn’t stop himself from looking at the face she bore and thinking that it would be like fucking her from behind as he pushed his throbbing hard-on into her. The look in her eyes, the way she was whispering and the way her chest was shaking just made his dick ache just to have a chance at fucking her. He wondered what her pussy looked like. He hoped she was as wet as that. When he finished what she’d said and asked how she knew, she told him that she told about four guys at some party in the town that she knew all that time ago. Apparently she had gotten a ride at one of the clubs, and one of the guys got on the phone with her and then he went home to his wife.</p> <p>It made sense and was probably a good time to move on to a new adventure in the area, he thought. He figured he’d better try it next time and see where it went.</p> <p>His last memory of his life was watching a gang bang on the screen of his laptop. When he woke up his life had changed for the better and he couldn’t get over the fact that he hadn’t gone to a party with a real man. It felt like a big step for him and he had hoped he could do that again so he could at least look at some people from the perspective that he had.</p> <p>He didn’t need to sleep a wink and was actually surprised to think that he had fallen asleep with his hard dick jutting out in front of him. He could have just taken it out and stroked it for a while but the memory of it made him feel even harder.</p> <p>He decided to spend the rest of the day looking at the sites of old friends in the school. One of the sites featured mostly women that he knew from somewhere that they didn’d been with a party, and many of them had been at one or more than one man. The United Nations party together, even. He’d noticed that they were very small groups that the world’d been on the president of the country or a country, but president. That kind of presidents even—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
