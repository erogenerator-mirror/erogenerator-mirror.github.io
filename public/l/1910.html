Let not that chief commanding part of thy soul be ever subject to</h4><p><strong>any variation through any corporal either pain or pleasure, neither suffer it to be mixed with these, but let it both circumscribe itself, and confine those affections to their own</strong> personas so they may share in it or its influence.</p> <p>I felt my cock enter her tight pussy, filling her up and stretching her hole, her body adjusting to the size of my erection. Her legs wrapped around me, her stomach rising and falling as her excitement grew.</p> <p>I felt her pussy get tighter, feeling her juices being spread all around my cock. I began to pump back of her, feeling my cock moving in and out, sliding in a little deeper each time, feeling her tight love passage gripping and releasing me.</p> <p>I felt her pussy begin to squeeze, trying to find more of my cock each time I entered her. All the different kinds of pleasure felt in different ways. I had the feeling of her pussy getting tighter, feeling it grip and release my penis each time I thrust into her. As the sensations grew each time. Her tight snatch seemed to squeeze me even tighter, but this caused my cock to go almost all the way out and then all the way back in like a piston. Her pussy began to feel good. I began to pick up pace, pumping my shaft all the way to a spot in the middle of her pussy that only happened when I was really excited and could go long enough.</p> <p>Her pussy felt so good, like a woman, and I found myself pumping fast into her. Her movements grew, her ass cheeks were going up into the air in a sensual rhythm. It was more than enough to bring me over the edge, and I began to feel the explosion of my sperm exploding in her. I filled her cunt as deeply as I could and thrust hard again into her. My entire body went rigid and I fell forward on her back, feeling the walls of her pussy hugging and massaging my cock, squeezing against me as my seed emptied into her.</p> <p>I rolled onto my back and looked at her. She was still, and her beautiful face was puffy and her eyes were closed. I looked at her pussy, swollen with my cum, still swollen with my cum and all the juices covering it in her juices, her thighs open and glistening. She was breathing hard, and her cheeks were red. She pulled her hands up to her face, and her whole body was twitching and relaxing. My cock twitched, and I felt it begin to soften. I felt the bed sink, and I knew she was dead of exhaustion. I was in no hurry to go anywhere that night; I had done a lot the past couple of days.</p> <p>I rolled over onto my side to look at her. She was breathing slowly, but her face looked like it had been abused when she had been raped. I looked at it, lying there, and suddenly the guilt I felt about making her like this was washed away into an explosion of happiness and satisfaction. I felt a feeling of joy sweep through me, and my dick began to harden again. I looked at her, and saw that she had rolled over to get more comfortable against the pillows, and that she had her eyes closed. I thought, 'what a wonderful wife. We've had so much fun'. We began to have another drink, and then had another talk. I was still in a state of confusion, but I found it very enjoyable, and she too was enjoying it.</p> <p>After we had another drink, and talked, she started to get uncomfortable. I noticed that she didn't seem to be upset by it, she seemed relieved. Her face lit up and she kissed me lightly on the cheek. "You've filled me up", she said, and then smiled. "Wasn't it great for you? You felt good, but my pussy was empty when I walked out last night. I really didn't enjoy it. Thank you", she said.</p> <p>She smiled at me and started rubbing her hands across my body again. Her hands came down on top of mine, and she ran a finger between them. I felt her fingernails, so soft on my skin. I began to slide my body up and down hers as she did so, and felt her pussy slide up into mine again. She moved her legs up my body so that her feet were on the bed, her knees on either side of my hips. We were both stretched out in the chair.</p> <p>I felt her fingers running through my chestnut hair. "I've been looking forward to this," I said. "I know you and Tony went this way." I was sitting there watching this beautiful woman who was also married as she told me this.</p> <p>She got out of bed and moved over to the bed. She grabbed both of my hands, and then placed them on her breasts. "You're not a man," she said, her face scrun, a look of passion. "Are you've made these women's pussy full, are filled with many woman's love's. You're woman's pussy full of love's pussy".
