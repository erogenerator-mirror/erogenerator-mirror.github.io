If you are under 18 in your situation then please do not proceed to further. It will seem somewhat awkward for the subject in your situation to know what happened. If your subject is old enough for you and you need to proceed, please use a pseudonym and don't use this information on this subject in your privacy."</p> <p>"In summary, a subject is willing to participate in sexual activities that a subject voluntarily participates in. This means that subject may masturbate in his own private way, or he may perform sexual acts or in his own private way, or he may ejaculate his semen into another's rectum using something other than his own semen!"</p> <p>"Of course, I agree, for as I can testify at one time or in another subject, I can attest that there is a subject willing to go along with the act. It is a matter of being honest with them about their own feelings, in regards to sexual activities."</p> <p>"How many of those you mentioned before?"</p> <p>Greta responded, "I have to agree to not know more than one person."</p> <p>Then, he continued, "I think most of them are either not interested in sex, and/or interested in someone else, just because they like sex. I have to agree, though, that if my subject was willing to participate in sex with other people, in that regard we could be in the same situation as someone he sees in a mirror in a magazine, or an x-rated video, and I could read the word "in the mirror".</p> <p>"And anyway, I must admit, if I don't feel I am interested in my subject, I don't believe I am so inclined to pursue my fantasy. In the presence of other people, I have to agree that the sexual activity with him or she is not the same as the sexual activity that they would have with another, if one is willing to participate with their participation in the sexual activities.</p> <p>"So as I said, with me being on the subject, it is hard to say. In the presence of other people there is also a matter of my subject being open to sexual activities with another. Even if a subject wants to participate in sex with another woman, it is a matter of some guy's hand on my buttocks or his finger on my clitoris. Moreover, if the subject does not enjoy participating sexually, then there are other ways to find out why the subject is interested in sexual action with another woman."</p> <p>"In all honesty, I think it would be an easy process to find an interested subject to become aroused by seeing another woman sexually stimulated. But, in the case there might be little to no problem, and even if a subject enjoys watching other women enjoy watching other guys in more intimate manner."</p> <p>"I have to agree, but I am starting on that front too," said Greta, "and besides, the subject is willing to participate in sexual activities I would not wish to attempt."</p> <p>"Yes, I agree," said Tom, "And as for you, I have to agree with you as well, too."</p> <p>"That's why I felt I should share you, too."</p> <p>Before Greta could respond, a phone rang in her pocket. Without thinking, she answered it. When the operator recognized it as the name of one the local sex clinic, she looked at her husband carefully.</p> <p>"Oh, hi, did I interrupt anything?" she answered without sounding anxious.</p> <p>"Not at all. Greta, this is Doctor D. He is an Emergency Nurse with a group that specializes in Sexual Endocrinology for the elderly. Greta and the two others that followed, Dr. D's, are also doctors in his group, but his group is also a group we have had over the years. I guess I will have to give your name in your medical records to see if you have been working on this type of exam."</p> <p>"Oh, of course, Dr. D. How thoughtful of you," she said.</p> <p>He had made sure to have a lot of "doctor in the room" to cover his activities. He had a plan to bring her into his group. She was an OB-GYN doctor. That wasn't much of a doctor's job, but at least it was close enough to the subject's condition to be a "doctor's wife."</p> <p>"Hi, "Hi" Dr. Hi"."</p> <p></p> <p>"Hi, Hi, Hi, hi, Hi. Hi, Hi?"</p> <p>"Dr. Hi, Hi, hiâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
