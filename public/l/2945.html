He made it known that Moses was a Christian and was to be worshipped by all those who worshiped Moses. I looked at myself and said, "That's it now, that's the best time to fuck. If Jesus wants all that, why don't you make it worth his while?"</p> <p>"Yes," Ishtar said with a smile. "I love the idea of you and I and Moses fucking each other. Isn't there always something better for the both of us?"</p> <p>"There always is," I said as I slowly unbuttoned and unzipped my jeans. "I think Moses is a lucky man if he has a strong lover."</p> <p>"I do," Ishtar's face showed her surprise but she smiled like a Cheshire Cat and said, "Then again he's a lucky guy to have a lover, too."</p> <p>I took hold of Ishtar's wrist and helped her out of her sneakers and slacks and then eased her onto her back on the bed. I climbed between her legs and kissed her again. I slid into her and began to fuck her in earnest. Ishtar didn't seem to notice that I had already begun to get her off.</p> <p>"I think he wants to eat my pussy and make me come," Ishtar said as she spread her legs for me.</p> <p>"You'll probably feel his cock sliding through your cunt," I laughed.</p> <p>Ishtar shook her head yes but it was barely audible since she was breathing hard. "And he'll want to eat me too," she added with a grin.</p> <p>"That's what Moses does when he's fucking you," I said and started to fuck her. "Maybe when his cock gets inside of you," I added thinking that if we didn't start fucking at the same time that will be a blessing.</p> <p>"Yes," Ishtar said as I started pounding her hard. "He loves a good fuck too. Does it feel good, love it, love it?"</p> <p>I nodded yes but I didn't need to answer all that. I knew where I wanted to hear it as it was. "It's just the three of us now," I said with a smile. "Me, you and Moses and my god and all your friends."</p> <p>"Moses and my god wants to make love to my god," Ishtar grinned. "He loves how he feels inside of you."</p> <p>I could feel that she liked it too and her mouth opened even farther as I started fucking her harder. "Moses is such a good lover, Ishtar," I told her as I fucked her faster. "Just like Moses. You know that what I'm doing to him is good. Does he love what we're doing to each other."</p> <p>"Yes," Ishtar said. "He loves making love to me the way I make him happy." She closed her eyes and I felt the orgasm start.</p> <p>"Oh man that's good," Ishtar groaned as her body trembled. "Ohmighty, I'm coming."</p> <p>"That's just wonderful," I said but I kept pounding Ishtar's pussy.</p> <p>I felt Ishtar's entire body tense and then it relaxed as her orgasm continued. It seemed to last for just a bit, but it wasn't long before we both were coming down off the wave but there was something else.</p> <p>"You are one horny fuck," I said and I kissed Ishtar's neck. The feel of her body trembled underneath me, especially when I kept thrusting. "And you're going to let me make love to you in a few days." I told Ishtar as I continued to kiss her neck.</p> <p>"Moses has always asked me to give him hand jobs," Ishtar said as she squeezed my dick. "Sometimes I let him give me head but never let him fuck me."</p> <p>We both lay on the bed still connected although my dick went soft in no time. I slipped outta Ishtar's pussy and rolled over to spoon with her.</p> <p>"Does that bother you," Ishtar asked. "Would you like me to make love to you?"</p> <p>"No," I said. "I don't think you'd believe me if I tried."</p> <p>"No, no," Ishtar said. "Just love me, don't tell me that you don't love me."</p> <p>"We can always just stay together," I told Ishtar.</p> <p>"Moses doesn't seem to want to make love to you," Ishtar said as she turned around on her side to face me. "He's got a little crush on you."</p> <p>"I have a crush on him," I answered then. "A little one for everyone is the right."</p> <p></p> <p>I didn't remember me saying that that but I loved her body as I was as I loved her body was always happy. So was her.
