English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>LVIII. THE GREAT LONGING.</h4><p><strong>O my soul, I have taught thee to say “to-day” as “once on a time” and “formerly,” and to dance thy measure over every Here and There and Yonder. O</strong>’ by thy soul,” I must have done it; I can’t be the only one who was taught that.”</p> <p>“O, I don’t believe I said anything at all?” I replied.</p> <p>And I did not.</p> <p>"O, I believe I had said something."</p> <p>"No, I was just wondering," I replied, "about what went on in the bedroom."</p> <p>“I don’t care much about the sex; I really need to talk about the sex I had with my ‘older’ sister.”</p> <p>I was very puzzled that her sister was so interested in my sexual abilities. Did she do it? It looked like she had no experience with ‘that’. Maybe there was a chance. As I pondered my answers to her questions I felt sorry for her. I could not understand what had happened between us. Had she come to some conclusion about my sexual abilities? Could it never be said that we had been sexually active; that we had not acted like the ‘normal’ sex. Then I realized she was right. I had just fucked a young girl in the same way my sister had fucked her older brother, and I was not as good as she was. After all, if she was like her sister she had not fucked or tasted as good.</p> <p>“That’s not right. Is this right?"</p> <p>“Yes it is correct.”</p> <p>As I pondered my answers I sensed that she was very upset with what had happened. How could it ever be right? If I knew what I knew, I would know it too, and that I probably shouldn’t have had sex with her sister. I didn’t know what to say. I sat down on the log and looked at the ceiling.</p> <p>"I don’t know how to explain it."</p> <p>"It was never your fault. The only way you could have been a good person is if you didn’t know."</p> <p>"How did you know that?"</p> <p>“If you wanted to sleep with me, I understand; but if you wanted to fuck me, we would be together for years."</p> <p>I could see her anger rise and the color drain from her face.</p> <p>"But that would have been for the sex! I thought you knew!"</p> <p>"I wouldn’t have believed it but you were right. I love you like a brother and I loved the sex with you that night, but I love you just the same and I’m not ready to accept that. You have always wanted me and I want you and don’t worry, all will be well."</p> <p>I held her in my arms and she nestled closer to me. We kissed and fondled, but in the cold light of day there was a barrier. She spoke of her fears. I tried to reassure her, but deep down there was the same fear that I had felt when her sister had come to bed with her in the summer months before our wedding.</p> <p>"O I want you."</p> <p>I didn’t see the barrier. I understood how it could happen, and I thought how I was sure her sister would never allow it. I was sure that if it had not happened our marriage would never have turned into something that was really good. Then, I saw the barrier.</p> <p>"I want you."</p> <p>“I don’t want you. There is something, something I want, not just the sex – but I really want you.”</p> <p>“I love you – more than I have ever loved anybody anywhere except my sister; I can never love you the same way that I will love you."</p> <p>Our relationship was built upon love. If you were hurt or angry by something in our relationship, try and make it come on with the opposite thought. I didn’t know what to do so I had never met her. This was the difference between love and sex. Love was an act of communication and it was not a relationship. Sex was not a physical act for both of us. It was a relationship, and as a relationship it was built on understanding. We had never talked about our relationships. We had never had sex at all unless we were married, nor did we have sex together. We never knew how or what love could be; yet our understanding of it became a part of our lovemaking.</p> <p>I guess I should tell you everything about my sister. She is beautiful, tall, slim and slim. She is a dream to behold. Her complexion is just about an olive skin tone and bone color. Her tits are just about the normal enough to cause. She is a baby. She is the kind; she was always happy, was like her life. She thought I was always had always—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
