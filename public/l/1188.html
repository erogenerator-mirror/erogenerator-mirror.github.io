So the barricade of the Rue de la</strong> Pape. The first time I'd put the corset on I'd put the corseted sleeves up and around my waist, when a small group of boys and young women in bikies were carrying what looked like a sword-like weapon from nowhere. In a way, it was more convenient then to wear it in the army, but now when it was at home in the bedroom, I didn't need to worry about having to dress as a bride and mom for a wedding anyway. It did that, though. Now the corseted sleeves felt a bit looser, but was just as comfortable. Then again, the corset was just as convenient to stay in, and after the last days of the Civil War, it was pretty much what you'd wear on your wedding day.</p> <p>"Oops," I whispered just as I heard a noise in the hallway outside. I turned to see a young, well-manicured-looking man holding my right wrist. "Whoa!" "Whoa!" "Wait a few seconds," I told him. It wouldn't do to flash a bit of a picture of me. "I'm getting a little dizzy. I'm going to walk over there and take off my corset."</p> <p>"Nonsense," he said. "I'll be back in a sec, so you just relax and get comfortable."</p> <p>"Oh, sure!" I said cheerily.</p> <p>He looked a bit confused at my reply, and I pointed to the staircase door, which he opened and gestured to a door on the side of the stairs, where the doors were closed. "Yes, ma'am? Can we talk about this?"</p> <p>"I think so."</p> <p>"Uh, can I use the telephone?" he asked.</p> <p>"No, you can't."</p> <p>"I think so, too. I'll call back later." He glanced at the phone, then returned to my wrist. "OK. See you later."</p> <p>"Bye," I said. "Thank God you took off your corset!"</p> <p>The next ten minutes were a blur. I could hardly speak coherently as we passed through the corridors of the castle grounds that were a bit less then two floors high; a hallway led to the bathroom, but no one saw us. Instead I could only be described as a helpless victim of the moment, which is what happened to me in the stairwell. The boys that I was with at those parties, though, must have heard me. I'd been on my knees just past the open door. I'd already said "Thank God you took off your corset!" before turning to see an older boy with a large erection, holding up a cup of coffee in front of my face. I reached my hand out in a feeble attempt at protesting, but he just grabbed my face and jerked my lips up so the coffee was actually against my cheek. The man's cock wasn't just very big, like mine, but the head was much broader, maybe just over an inch or two, and it was so large I could hardly fit my tongue around it. I began to protest, but suddenly he shoved my mouth down around his cock and held me while I was bent backwards, helpless as a helpless bride on her wedding day.</p> <p>"That's better," he said, when I finally made a real sound of distress. Then he pulled my face back up with his cock, and it wasn't long before the next one was in my mouth as well. I guess it took a lot of saliva to get that big thing into the corset, because the next three of you (I thought to be at least thirteen or fourteen) took it in more easily. I think you may be right, though, at his thrusting, though it was almost too easy to imagine my face being distorted with the bulging cock I took up my slack mouth. Then he just pulled my head back up and pushed it down onto his cock, and after he'd released it from my lips, he gave my head another shove, forcing me to gag. A few men in his gang tried to hit me, so the only response I could get was to grab my head again, pushing it down faster against him while he forced my mouth down his cock again. And once I could feel him reaching his release, then pulling me up towards him for just another second, instead of up in time to the other side, so I just had to take the time to just catch my breath.</p> <p>Then came the second wave of men taking me to the stairs. As the ones who had started to get undressed and go on with their duties, the next ones who did my head were taking me to the stairs to be the bath, took me upstairs, and were in a bit by bit by bit while they just as they made me to the staircase. Then, like they went up and just like they were taking me until they did—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
