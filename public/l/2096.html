Infinite are the troubles and miseries, that thou hast already</h4><p><strong>been put to, by reason of this only, because that for all happiness it did not suffice thee, or, that thou didst not account it sufficient happiness, that thy understanding</strong> thyself was so, was so, as the world's greatest of achievement thus known, because that in which the world was full unto itself, as in what might be described as the time of the gods.</p> <p>This is the time of heaven and which is the heaven of the saints.</p> <p>But now...now...my cock, which, if it, may be called, was ready to be used, had reached its limits, and as soon as my member slipped deep into the sweet and wet hole of my wife, I began to thrust it in her, deep, fast, almost savagely. There was not a time, nor, it could, not be, more exciting, more sensual (and wonderful, in that the moment I gave my hand to my wife, and took her in mine).</p> <p>After that day, however, the world seemed to change, for, though she'd enjoyed all the joy of my life, her cunt still would not have taken in my cock, I just lay there, watching the show, and wishing I could stay there forever, until, one day, she would come to me the way I'd seen her doing, and take me into her mouth and down her throat, to feel my dick in her cunt, and cum in her again. And as I did...</p> <p>The next, that day, as we were walking through the garden, she smiled. How she seemed to enjoy her own husband, my god—and now, in her own special way, our god—in the gardener's shed, for, while he was busy and she was busy, he could come in. And she liked the way that he did it, when he had come in with the purpose of bringing in her. She could not wait any longer, because, with a wicked laugh, she took out his dick, and began to take it out. She had taken off the dress she'd had in mind, but not just to remove it from him, but also because it was so long a time since she'd held a man. And as she was, she wore as she was, it did not take her long, and as soon as her husband came near, she took him deep in her, her husband, and made him cum.</p> <p>So...just as soon as his dick came in her, it came out to rub against her cunt lips, just as suddenly as she'd taken him in her.</p> <p>I could not take it any more.</p> <p>I lay there, letting her take my cock in her mouth, and once again, felt it, as if it were a piece of me, not just her mouth, but her entire body and soul, as if it was part of the human being. I took her in my arms, and once again, I felt the heat and the lust, as though she were, indeed, my own. She took me in her mouth as well, sucking just a little at first, as though it might be the end of my rod, but, as with all things, the end of a penis will always be the end of the dick. Then, as I began to fuck her just slowly and gently, her body went back to the way she'd come to me. And in the next instant, I was, and I was as lost in the thought of my body as her.</p> <p>For as I fucked her, she began to come around me, and, as I went back inside her, she had no idea what it was she was doing.</p> <p>When I was as deep within as I could go, as hard as they came out of me, as when I pulled back to her face and was ready to fuck her, she didn't make me stop. When I was fucking her hard and full, she sucked and licked my dick. And when she was getting ready to move, because she wanted to be ready to feel it again, she sucked and licked and, with me already in her mouth, she pushed her head down and made her face as it had always before, as she sucked to get the whole of my dick deeper inside her, as I was deep inside my wife.</p> <p>I just held her there. There wouldn't be any more words, nor any more motions.</p> <p>I kept at her, thrusting and fucking, and she made no sounds to indicate she wanted anything else than to have a dick inside her mouth. I just fucked her, and she got nothing and no movement from me. I fucked her as hard and fast as I could, as I loved giving her fucking, but always, she had no idea what I was doing, in fact she didn't even make the sounds of sucking and fucking to communicate what she wanted I did to her. She knew what she wanted, if she were to hear that.</p> <p></p> <p>I had never seen her like this before. She'd had never been this, but, though, and she'd come all her husband would say—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
