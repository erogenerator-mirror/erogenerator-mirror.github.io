Every morning she awoke in her tapestried room and found Martha kneeling upon the hearth</strong>rug. And each day she awoke in the bed with a cock filling her pussy at the same time. Mary had found each day by her own magical penultimate dream. In the most improbable moment of her life, she had never experienced so many pleasures, so many different ways and feelings, so many different kinds of sensations, so many different pleasures and pleasures on offer. It had been so easy and so wonderful and this was a dream so long in coming and it seemed so real.</p> <p>Mary woke up on occasion to see her best friend's long cock pushing between her lips and slowly becoming engorged and hard so she could suck on it more than she liked to do. Today she would be the one to bring her friend the ultimate pleasure she had never dreamed of. She licked her way up to kiss her hardening tip then engulfed it in her mouth. She continued sucking her way up her shaft and then back down. On each stroke she could taste her precum mixed with her saliva. She kept her eyes open so she could see what she was doing.</p> <p>In her dream it was she who was getting fucked in ways that Mary never thought she was capable of. Her friend had never felt so good and she couldn't stop her from pleasing herself with this woman's cock.</p> <p>"Fuck me, Mary, baby. Fuck me hard, make me come, I'm coming!" It was her friend's voice which signaled it was her turn to be the subject of this erotic love.</p> <p>Mary's eyes never left her hand which was gripping her cock as eagerly as she was sucking on her dick. As she was moaning and groaning with pleasure in between her lover's moans and groans she brought her other hand to her mouth so she could taste her pre-come.</p> <p>"I wanna taste yours," she said then she plunged her cock into her mouth so that she could taste the salty treat before sucking it completely out of her mouth and again, in time to her own groans of pleasure.</p> <p>The sight of Mary's tongue sliding around her cock made her almost come to the brink so she pulled her slowly out of her mouth, held onto her cock that was standing straight up, then sucked it back in again. She sucked her friend harder wanting to make her cum as much as she was enjoying, wanting to savour the taste of the warm and sticky pre-come which she had just finished sucking out of her.</p> <p>The feeling of cumming for the first time was something she would remember for the rest of her life. It always sent her over the edge. Mary was enjoying herself so much when she came. She would wake up in the morning on the first day of the next semester. If it wasn't for the feeling of her warm sperm flowing into her mouth, the thought would have her smiling with joy, happy for her friend who shared her secret with her in an even more intimate way than mere sex. That was what she wanted her best friend to feel for her.</p> <p>When Mary arrived at the college the night of her eighteenth birthday she was eager for this moment and was surprised to find she hadn't left her car at home nor that she had even touched hers so recently. It was the most erotic thing she had ever dreamed of seeing. With the car fully loaded and the campus on her left, she could hardly get out of her house without touching herself. She thought surely a student would walk right by, but that wasn't the case when she had been waiting for her dream to come true.</p> <p>When she entered her apartment she was pleasantly surprised when she saw the door wasn't locked. She walked in the hall to look at the room which was decorated more like a school room than school. She felt slightly ashamed about that as she didn't belong in a school that looked a little like that anymore and yet could be so familiar with the other schools' rooms. She felt an even larger shame when she found her friend's room was in fact hers which was her place from last night. That was the first day she had been with Mary and she had always felt a little uncomfortable.</p> <p>"It's so nice to see you again, Mary," was all that she could come up with.</p> <p>"Me too, Mary, it's been such a long time since I've seen you," was her only answer.</p> <p>For such a strange moment, Mary suddenly remembered her own dream that day. She was glad that she had felt the warm afterglow of her new school. She had thought that the experience would never end, but now she realized she probably didn't know how to convince herself of her real life after this happy childhood. Her life after such as it. She entered her eighteenth she wanted to change as she wanted to be an interesting. She wanted to be different. She was to have to be happy.</p> <p></p> <p>Mary woke to she didn't be she couldn't she</p> <p>-to see</p> <p>to she Maryâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
