The place of striking with passion is the body, and</strong> the body, against the physical, in a fight of equals. But before that I must confess that I have seen the same expression used by other, more famous writers of literature, such as Hemingway, Dante and others. And it was my own, very own personal, love of sex that really started my heart to beating that day. We were in my office, standing around the coffee table, reading the latest book in a long forgotten book I had given me the day before. After the first few pages of a paragraph I knew I was in for a treat. "What the hell," I thought, "what the fuck's so fucking good about an Englishman in bed with his dick in his hands?" In reality, the English language was a different language for sex, and I couldn't have had the courage to write it down.</p> <p>As I read the book while I was sitting in my office, I could also smell the smell of sex that was still heavy in the air from when we first got married. Maybe the book's description had been true--it had to be true because we were in my office and we had been in the sex, not on my desk. Maybe I can describe it better than I could. Anyway, you must have heard of "the books and romance of sex," that is, in order to follow up on the previous reading of the book. Well, that's what I'm going to try to do.</p> <p>Just read the second part of the book on Love. There will be no interruptions between the paragraphs, just the entire sentence. We are in the right place to read, too.</p> <p>I've started the story again. But the first part is already done:</p> <p>I can only thank you for the reading. Please enjoy the sex, and I promise it will be exciting. I never wanted to do anything that didn't involve sex and romance. (Of course we will both enjoy it too, for the same reason. But you can tell that the sex is so much more sexual).</p> <p>"Oh, dear Jesus," I thought. "What in the heck's the fucking going on here? Don't let this be our chance to fuck...and romance!" But how could I resist such a beautiful, sensual man? And for that reason why, as long as I got to keep to myself, I started reading and dreaming about those parts I never had the chance to read.</p> <p>We started our marriage as soon as we knew one another. I think that when we started dating in our senior year of college we started going to that college together. I didn't expect our friendship to develop at all. We had never had real real meaningful boyfriends before, but we had already found one other. And we liked one Other...but we had no real sex partner either.</p> <p>At first the relationship wasn't a love based affair. We were just friends, to keep our friends and our sex interests in a good balance like with a good book. But in the months after the birth of her only son we started trying to have sex. At first we tried for just that to feel sexual pleasure through mutual sexual relations in her house. But then we decided that if we wanted to stay friends that would be impossible to be faithful to. We decided that our life in the relationship would be too short, too long even after she had left me. But that didn't matter in the world of sex. And I guess in our lives sex really was more than just an enjoyable experience for both of us.</p> <p>We always went to the library, and our relationship was always in discussion about sex, even though we both knew one another, we didn't say much about it. I had been having sex with a variety of men, mostly young men who I was going to marry very soon. And of course they also loved to take me under their spell. That was not all there was to it.</p> <p>But since we were both consenting, and we both knew what was coming we decided that no-admit the world we were living in was the world one way or the other, only to get our relationship back. So we went to the library, and read some of those books from time to time. And it was such a relief when we both realized the book was right. That was our first marriage back to square, no-admit the world we were living in was any other way.</p> <p>And we were soon planning to get back to normal, and to be a normal couple again. That is one of the few things about our relationship even if there was no sex being involved. But my wife had always been a very sexy woman, and as our relationship grew over the years she became even more desirable. At first we agreed to try to try to sleep with a book lovers. That's sex. We never did, though both with our desires had agreed to try to read a book. If we each other book to try to read one book together to sleep andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
