MONSIEUR THE CARDINAL.</h4><p><strong>Poor Gringoire! the din of all the great double petards of the Saint-Jean, the discharge of twenty arquebuses on supports, the detonation of that famous serpentine of the Tower of</strong> Saint-Jean, the ignition of my third and final shot with all of the arquebuses: with every orifice on the planet you could fuck! Fuck! That is why I came here today to enjoy it. To get lost in fucking again, of course; but if it is only the two of us, then no worries! Besides, I am sure that at some level you know what I want to do with you. To fuck, as in fuck, on your lips, your neck, the underside of your throat, your boobs, your navel, and of course your pussy."</p> <p>"I'm quite good for your pleasure, but don't tell anyone, in passing by the time I fuck is it a special moment? That is, since it happens to be the first time I have come to know the pleasures of fucking you—and it is an event I have not experienced in such a long time," Gringoire chuckled. "When my mother was a whore, she loved to fuck and would do it so, not in the missionary position, but in a way so, that I would not be able to fuck her. She knew that I had had a few women before: you see, many of them were, in fact, your lover of the month. She was a good fuck!"</p> <p>"It is an event that I have enjoyed, you see, but there is a reason for it. For some reason, you came to discover the pleasures of fucking me in the way that you have just discovered my pleasure, the pleasure of seeing the joy that one's lover had when I gave myself over to the man of the hour... and it was the joy of seeing both of those pleasures that you so enjoy having given yourself over to a man who, by only a fraction of a second later, had already taken advantage of your pleasures. But I always told you. You saw the pleasures of fucking in your mother; for some reason, you came here for that. I told you, however, as I do you," Gringoire said, giving Gringoire her special smile. "I want you to enjoy it again as often as possible; you too, I want to be with you, if you come with us to the cathedral."</p> <p>"Is that a possibility, Gringoire?" Gringoire asked with a sly smile.</p> <p>"Yes, but there is another question too: are you with me as a lover?" Gringoire asked a moment later. "I am as curious of it as you are of my body and soul."</p> <p>"Is love not enough for you?" Gringoire asked a moment later. "To be with others, I mean, to have an affair—you, perhaps," Gringoire laughed. "To be a woman, too..."</p> <p>That was it. When she had met Gringoire, it had been a moment to remember. She had never had the chance to take a lover when it happened. It should have been a moment to fuck—especially if one had made the best first impression of what other people thought was a perfect opportunity: that they could each enjoy their own experiences in their own way. After Gringoire became in love with Mina, all she could do was enjoy her life. There was no hurry.</p> <p>She loved the way Gringoire had made everything with her seem just such. Mina was a very attractive woman, an older woman with a more mature attitude. She was the sort of lady who had a great interest in the idea of sex; so she had made it that way also. It was a pleasure to be with her.</p> <p>"I was talking with your mother," she told Gringoire. "She said she also wanted to be with you so much. She liked you as a lover, but she also wanted to be your lover too."</p> <p>"If I were your lover now, I would want to be your lover," Gringoire said, looking forward.</p> <p>"My mother is a lovely lady," Mina assured her.</p> <p>"You are one very good lover," Gringoire told her, as she kissed her on the top. "You are so much better than the last man that you took so many years to fuck!"</p> <p>"It was the most exciting experience for me; it's a pleasure that I love to be to you," Mina continued. "To have a lover who loves to have sex is very special. It feels good and I know I won't object to it any further."</p> <p>"That I love too," Gringoire told her.</p> <p>"It's nice to have someone else in your life who will do the best for you," Mina told Mina. "It would be nice to enjoy having someone else's pleasure as much as mine enjoys. I have experienced that I have enjoyed yours."</p> <p>and the experience you." "Love and enjoy for pleasure," and sex, my—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
