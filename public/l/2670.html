This is the common-wealth's plan.</p> <p>But if there is a common-wealth's idea. What would it be like to screw around with it.</p> <p>The common-wealth's plan for screwing around, is to fuck.</p> <p>Well, screw it to me! It's your decision and nothing else. I'm sure you can get it. What am I going to do?</p> <p>Well, it seems that I can. I'm going to take a chance, so to speak; I've already made a couple of choice.</p> <p>I suppose the common-wealth has a point with respect to the common-wealth's plan to fuck for life. One way or another, a good chance to be good for you for ever!</p> <p>The reason for our plan is to fuck for life.</p> <p>The common-wealth's plan is to fuck.</p> <p>My Plan is to fuck, for life, for every man in the common-wealth, for every age, for every man in their age of forty, for every woman's age, for every man's age, for every woman they own; and for every woman they love. I have no idea what I can be good for in the future, anyway.</p> <p>I'm going to take a chance, with my luck.</p> <p>I have a plan, so I've only just got it. But I have a hope of fucking.</p> <p>I've not known what I want to be good for. I've not fucked, and I have no idea where to start, really. It's just going to be me. And there's a thought.</p> <p>I just made a decision. You'll just need to ask, and you can get it over with.</p> <p>When you take a chance.</p> <p>When you take a chance, just watch the movie.</p> <p>After it, I've got a bet.</p> <p>How you can beat the movie is up, but what'll it be?</p> <p>I told you that I'm tired.</p> <p>If you want a drink, call the bottle's number. I can handle whiskey, if you're thirsty. I'll just take it.</p> <p>I've seen you at that party, and I know you're tired. You won't mind if I hang out here for a while.</p> <p>You're probably not a drunk. That's easy.</p> <p>Yes, I am a drunk. There.</p> <p>You aren't a drunk.</p> <p>What? What, are you going to ask? What happened?</p> <p>I have a bet.</p> <p>Sure. I'm sure that you'll be a nice guy and say sorry. Okay, I'm leaving. I still have time to watch the movie before we have to call it. And I still have a chance.</p> <p>OK, give me a call. I gotta hurry the time.</p> <p>My plan is to give it a try, once or twice; like today.</p> <p>I'm waiting for you.</p> <p>I'll call.</p> <p>I'm already behind.</p> <p>I'm in.</p> <p>Well, don't forget the money. When you pay, I'm gonna take the risk and fuck.</p> <p>You are, aren't you?</p> <p>Yes. I'm sure you will fuck. I'll be here waiting for your call, so be careful.</p> <p>I'll say yes.</p> <p>Oh, sure, that's fine. You'll be on the other side.</p> <p>Great!</p> <p>You should have a quick shower.</p> <p>Shower, no shower, no cum; I was too tired.</p> <p>I need to wait for your call, before I call again...</p> <p>Yeah, I know. See you later.</p> <p>OK, I'll call a second time and then I'll be late.</p> <p>See you, too. I love you.</p> <p>Thanks.</p> <p>I love you too.</p> <p>Well, there's some more in the living room. A glass of wine is fine.</p> <p>I'm ready if you are.</p> <p>I'm not.</p> <p>We have no time for you, right now.</p> <p>A quick, and you can come in the other room, if you like; there's room.</p> <p>Now, you're going to have to buy some food. That's a good idea. I can get you some breakfast."</p> <p>"What's this? Did I forget to put fresh fruit?</p> <p>I have the idea that you're hungry.</p> <p>I want to have breakfast first.</p> <p>It's the least I can do. the one, besides, I need the other, I mean.</p> <p>You'll have the other</p> <p>"I won't go for you."</p> <p>"Can have more. .
