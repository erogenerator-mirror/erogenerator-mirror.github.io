One, when they are new, and yet their meaning not explained by Definition; whereof there have been aboundance</strong> in a language called. English. The only thing in this world that the human heart is capable of hearing is some language that will forever affect any subject who tries to tell it or speak it. A second language is as much a component of this time period as if all the planets were in orbit over the solar system. Now I can write this story about the first time I fucked a girl. It all began one day, because I met and fell in love with her at that time. She was tall and slim and beautiful and had a sweet face. The first thing I did was fuck her. That's why her first taste of good cock was her first. Because my first tastes were her taste and therefore her first fuck. I was determined that we were a one-and-done pair, since we'd already made some real, lasting impression on each other. We'd already been married and had our children and had been raised together, so we're destined to be together. To be fair, we had a great sex life. She'd never been faithful, nor had she ever tried, but the best sex I get was in lovemaking, and in it, she'd been very good. As for her initial desire for me sexually: well, she was more like that than the way I used her body in the sack. But to know the truth: we'd already gotten married. We're a happy couple.</p> <p>We made love almost continuously for three months, and the first six months, we had been together about as often as we could manage. We would be fucking for a few weeks, then we'd start out fucking again in about a year, which we usually did on time, but on some weeks, we could be together in a half hour or more, and on other nights, we'd be in the middle of fucking each other at our mutual pace. She still hadn't tried to get me to give her a big-time, no matter what she thought that 'big thing' was. I still didn't have any interest in screwing her: that was probably due to the lack of any other ideas sexually other than I was still married to her and, even though she was the object of my desires anyway, she was the most attractive woman I knew and, I would have thought about screwing her whenever I was free that very second, and it gave me an idea for my next trip to my home town.</p> <p>I decided that we should do something and not fuck just for some time. We were going to do that right away, so no condom, or even a vibrator, or even a vibrator was too risky. So we didn't fuck. Not with our legs together in a doggy style position. So we didn't fuck during intercourse. It was better to just do the thing together. We were going to do that, with our mouths on her breasts. That was it. We just had to put it on and then let it happen. We didn't even touch each other before that point. Then I would go back home, be the guy, but then I'll be on the phone, with my husband fucking another woman over my terms, but I'll be with one another in the next six months, as soon as we get back to the U.S. So I was pretty good, and maybe if I had any other ideas, I'd have thought of something.</p> <p>My idea for our third "romance" was to let her suck my cock for the first time, and that was the plan for three nights. She was a pretty good cock sucker. A little later, I got her into my bed and we did it missionary. After twenty minutes of foreplay, she was ready to come. She was an expert cocksucker, and she would get me off and have me soon. She'd suck me off on my knees, not really on my cock, but to my surprise, she could deep-throat me, and take off the condom. And she'd get so wet it was almost painful, and I had to hold her down, so she would keep sucking my cock.</p> <p>I finally came in her mouth, and she licked it off me after the first squirt. Her mouth tasted a bit like something made for the man. She sucked me off, her tongue bathing my shaft in thick, white wetness.</p> <p>I'd have to be very very nice, I told her. And she knew it. I told her to go to the washroom. I went into the men's room and put on her strap-on rubber, which was a little bigger than my cock, and went in there and turned on the lights. My cock is still hard and, I mean STRETELY hard. She looked up at me. I had been watching her as she walked out on that door. Butt I had not even given her that much notice she was a hard, but now, and I had her ass, now that was hard.
