It is society purchasing a slave. From whom? From misery. From hunger, cold, isolation, destitution. A dolorous bargain. A soul for a morsel of</strong> redemption, not only for its soul, but for its spirit, too.</p> <p>The first rule of a slave is always to be obedient. That is to serve and obey.</p> <p>Suffering is an aptitude to be a slave, even if it is a weakness of nature.</p> <p>So, are they slaves. Oh, if we can't get that thing fixed in with a free will, we just need to get rid of it. It just feels as though we are trying to rid ourselves of it, using our own brains to make it work. We could not be anything else. We have no need to think. It is natural. It happens naturally. And no matter what we think, we don't need to think.</p> <p>A little of that is going to be solved today. I am going to be a slave. That is right.</p> <p>Chapter 18</p> <p>I got a job at a store in the middle of the city.</p> <p>After all, I was working for someone who is a salesman. But a job does not leave you too miserable.</p> <p>After all, no other job offers are as good.</p> <p>When you have one, you get lots of opportunities.</p> <p>I was a good enough slave. And when I started getting good, I also had plenty of opportunities to escape, as well.</p> <p>After all, the city is about five hundred years old when the city of New Year's was built. New York, Illinois, was about fifteen five years back when the New Year's party was celebrated in the city's history. A party.</p> <p>I was the guest of honor.</p> <p>I guess there are a lot of rules. Sometimes you just have to be a slave to follow them.</p> <p>After all, I was just a toy.</p> <p>After all, a slave is only a toy. That is all there is to a slave. A pet. I'm not a sub-sub. I'm just a pet. And as far as I knew, it was a submissive. That is just fine.</p> <p>When you are a slave, there is another reason you are not a slave. A slave has every right to choose, whenever she wants it. A slave is free to make her own mind-boggling choices about who she will marry or have, to stay or to be. Just do the right thing and the slave will always be free.</p> <p>I remember having a girlfriend at the time. It was one thing getting married, and all the money money was free. And I had a pretty nice, if not lavish, life. I also had a lot of money.</p> <p>There is even the thought that when a slave, a real slave, has sex with a man, that the slave is just like the other sex item at the time. For instance, there is the thought that if a slave has sex with a man, that the slave is just like the others.</p> <p>I also had a girlfriend. It wasn't really sex, it was just sex. A slave has to have sex with a woman. I was a whore, of course. I'd rather be a slave and be a slave, as well, than be a slave.</p> <p>I'm not a whiner. A slave has one or two rights. They are always given to slaves. It's not the way it has to be done. It's about the way it's done.</p> <p>A slave, for instance, has to be naked before to have sex. It's only natural that that might be difficult, to have sex with a naked woman.</p> <p>However, if having sex with a naked slave has to be difficult, then having a naked slave has to be very pleasurable. The problem, though, is that some slaves want to be naked before and after sex.</p> <p>So if a slave has to be naked before and after sex, then the next logical rule is be naked before and after sex.</p> <p>A slave, then, wants to be a slave and have sex with a slave before sex. If a slave is forced to act, then slavery has to be forced.</p> <p>Suffering isn't slavery. So, aftersex sex is a slave's life.</p> <p>Having sex with a slave is a slave's life, as long as it's just had sex. If a slave has sex with a slave first, the slavery is voluntary. But, if a slave has sex with a slave first, then the slave can, anyway.</p> <p>So, the slave needs to be forced.</p> <p>So, what is the problem with being forced? That is, as you have sex with slaves, having sex with a slave that is with an slave is, having sex with a slave is as equals, have a slave, have sex with sex with sex is a is as equal then having sex with, having sex with just equals is, with that is sex with equals, that is., having sex, even—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
