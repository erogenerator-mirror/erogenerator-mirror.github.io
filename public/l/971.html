The army yielded suddenly on all sides at once,—Hougomont, La Haie-Sainte, Papelotte, Plancenoit. The cry “Treachery!” was followed by a cry of “Save</strong> this “!” of “Oh!” and an expletive or two.</p> <p>I held the door open for the Guard, the men in uniforms and rifles, but I could see that no one could see in. We were out of sight.</p> <p>We had not long to continue my campaign. We were only three hours from the fortress. The guard had no intention to be left behind.</p> <p>The morning light streamed into the house, blinding us to even our peripheral vision. Even so, I think we were relieved. I made a couple of trips, passing on some of the men to fetch food. Then I had to wait, alone in the bed chamber for half an hour. That was the last of my time alone for the morning; I’d wanted to fuck now, so in reality it had not been long before I’d become a cuckold.</p> <p>The Guard was sitting at the kitchen table when I came in. He wore a sleeveless long-sleeved, sleeveless white shirt, which buttoned up the side. He had his arms crossed on his lap. It was obvious that his cock was hard underneath, and looked as big as a man could—and I felt for him like a dog that had just had a bite. He raised his hands and they clasped together, his face was twisted, and he closed his eyes.</p> <p>As if in answer, the cock that had just been left in that big hole for a second time stood tall and rock hard. I was ready.</p> <p>“Now?” I asked.</p> <p>“Yes.”</p> <p>I reached under my skirt and pulled off my panties, then took the crescent moon dress off. I was only wearing my bra and thong. I stood up and looked in the mirror again, and noticed that my cock was fully erect.</p> <p>“Hurry!” I said, and dropped my panties back down on the floor. I lay down again. He knelt between my legs, his face just an inch from my cock. I felt a finger on my lips and began to stroke my cock, but he said to me, “Now put the other one on for me.” I did, then he took the other one and stroked it. He said, “See for yourself.”</p> <p>My cock started to harden, and it began to swell as he leaned forward again. Then he did it again. My cock slid out. He leaned forward again, his lips went down on my cock again. I had to reach to hold the pillow that I’d been holding under my head. He lowered his open mouth onto my cock, and I couldn’t hold any more. Stream after stream of cum splashed on his lips when his tongue probed my slit and tasted my cum. My cock jerked inside his mouth. He moved to kiss me on the mouth, and we kissed for a long time.</p> <p>Then we lay side by side again, me lying on my back and him leaning on my chest. I was still hard. He looked at me and then said, “No. Put the other one on for me. And, keep stroking my cock.”</p> <p>I pulled off my panties, and lay nude on the bed. He rolled over, now on his back, and lifted the hem of my skirt up, and put his face between my legs. I felt his tongue dart out, running over my cock and clit, and finally reaching a finger on my asshole. I gasped loudly as he did this. Then he opened a hand and reached between my thighs and rubbed me into a frenzy. His finger slipped in my asshole. I was really excited too.</p> <p>I heard a low moan come from the pillow, and he felt it on the back of his hand and put his finger back into my asshole. I gasped again then reached down to touch my cock. He put the middle finger straight in his mouth, then took it out. I groaned. He raised his head to watch me.</p> <p>“Fuck!” I cried and began to stroke my cock.</p> <p>“What was that in the pillow?”</p> <p>“Sorry. I mean you were just about to explode. I did think you might be ready. My orgasm just stopped,” I said.</p> <p>“I told you that your cum was nice and wet. That’s why I took the other one all the way in last time. Now it’s my turn to make you cum,” he said.</p> <p>I felt the finger slip out and his mouth went down on my cock. I felt the finger again to put a finger to the asshole, then another fingertipot, then I took a stroke and slip it in, and slide the finger out and down—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
