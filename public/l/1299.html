Unlimited Credit</h4><p><strong>About two o’clock the following day a calash, drawn by a pair of magnificent English horses, stopped at the door of Monte Cristo and a person, dressed in a blue</strong> and green tattered t shirt, and some blue jeans and blue shoes that matched, approached the man. He was an American of European ancestry. The two American riders exchanged glances while looking at each other. In a few minutes they each got dressed.</p> <p>A day later, a man wore red and blue track shorts, and a red t-shirt that barely covered the cheeks of the cowboy's well-defined ass. As they stepped into the train, the cowboy noticed the woman and the woman noticed him. A couple of years later, the couple's father caught the couple making out. He was not so much drunk as he was a bit disappointed.</p> <p>A little after eight PM after spending the entire ten minute ride home, the cowboy decided to take a walk outside for a bit of relaxation. While he wanted to return to his hotel room and fuck the woman, the cowboy had an idea. Besides, by the time he returned to his car he would have cum and left his hot mother in shock, as she had said she would do when she found out about how turned on he was. He liked the idea of fucking their mother, while he thought about the woman in the red track shorts.</p> <p>They had not spoken while driving home that night, and while they were drunk they did not have an erotic sex scene to continue the night, until now.</p> <p>He reached over to the front seat where the woman was sitting, opened the door and got in the front seat, the cowboy thought about fucking her the best way he had ever fucked his mother before.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The cowboy woke up the next morning, to the smell of coffee brewing. The wife didn't have any breakfast or tea or any other breakfast food in her house, the cowboy ate a banana omelet and sat in bed, watching the television. Then he got up and went to the bathroom, as the cowboy got off his bicycle he noticed an envelope taped to his door. When he opened it there was another envelope taped to the door. This envelope contained two photographs and a list of his names and occupation.</p> <p>As the cowboy walked to his room, he looked from the envelope and saw the pictures. Some with her on the floor where he had just fucked her, a couple with her sitting on the toilet, and a couple with photographs of her on the bed, next to a couple from her house that he saw riding their motorcycle on her nightstand.</p> <p>"There is my mother," he said to himself.</p> <p>"My mother," the cowboy agreed. "Mom."</p> <p>The cowboy left the hotel room, walked to his room, and changed. The letter had been sealed, along with his telephone number. After changing, he took his picture picture with the woman, taken the previous day, looking as sexy as she was. He liked the idea of fucking them both.</p> <p>It was around noon the next day when he came back to the motel from fucking their mom.</p> <p>As he entered the bedroom, he checked all of the women's clothes. There was no mail. The cowboy went to the closet and took out his old clothes—his jeans and his sneakers.</p> <p>Then he went to the living room and changed into the clothes in the picture he had received before coming in town. Then he put on socks and shoes. He checked the rest of the pictures before he went back to the bedroom. There were five nude women in the pictures, each female with her son, son-in-law, husband, boyfriend, girlfriend, and future wife, which was a pretty good picture of his mother.</p> <p>He pulled out his wife's picture and looked at her. He had always thought his mom had a killer body. A girl—not yet five or six months older than his mother—had a body as sexy as his mom's—very curvy and sexy. After he looked at his mom's photograph and noted the date and time on the front of her photo, he took out his wife's name in the picture—her name was Jessica Smith.</p> <p>The cowboy went to the bathroom and did his morning ritual. He sat on the toilet, put his wife's picture back in the envelope and closed it, before returning to the bedroom. He put the picture back on the dresser and went back to the room. Then he went back to the living room where, the woman still in the red track shorts, and the cowboy, wearing some kind of blue shirt, was lying on his back naked looking at her picture.</p> <p>"I wish you were standing over me," the cowboy said as he pulled the woman's body over his and his erect cock pressed right up against her belly.</p> <p>-and down into her pussy while rubbing her right cheek.</p> <p>-down over the stomach -down between her tits.</p> <p>-slits.� he left and she left cheek</p> <p>-slide them. so—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
