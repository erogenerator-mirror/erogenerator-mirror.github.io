Ahab’s Leg.</h4><p><strong>The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel Enderby of London, had not been unattended with some small violence to his own person. He had lighted with</strong> his first and only act of defame on a young girl on a crowded train. He had taken her innocence as a symbol of his commitment to her innocence. He was going to fuck her. She was going to fuck him. The thought of this young woman doing him over and over again was one he had relished. He had loved her, and he loved making love with a young woman. He had loved her. And he had loved her.</p> <p>The train began to rise again. He had wanted her, but he hadn't had the nerve. He had been a novice in the sexual department, and had made no effort to learn the art of pleasure. After all, sex could be done with a woman's hands. The train began to move onwards, a bit faster than he had done in London before. He had been looking forward to finding the opportunity to fuck such a woman, and in particular, a lovely young woman that he knew about. He had taken her innocence for his trophy.</p> <p>The thought of having sex with her brought a tear to his eye. He had wanted her. But he had not had the nerve, and had gone with the train. He had spent the entire time staring at her. He had waited to kiss her. He had looked at her. He had wanted to kiss. He had wanted to make him love her, and he had found her. He had felt his cock harden with desire. He had watched her. He had watched as she had taken his shirt off and kissed her tits. He had seen her take his shirt off, and he had wanted to feel her skin as he was kissing her on the lips. He had loved the way the white of her skin had glistened against her bra as her bra had slipped down, and he had loved the way her nipples had hardened against her skin. He had had wanted to lick the underside of the breast she had been playing with, but he hadn't kissed her. He had held back.</p> <p>She had felt him. He had felt so hard. She had felt a little intimidated by his virility. But as she had slid down the wall of his underwear, she felt his throbbing member. He had felt her. He had been so excited to see her, to be able to see her in the throes of excitement. But here she was, with nothing on. And her innocence, she had felt as though she had just stepped into a school girl's locker room. As though no-one cared, that she had chosen to show herself through the school halls.</p> <p>He had felt her breasts. He had felt the smooth skin of her breasts. Her cleavage had felt so soft. So warm, so soft. He had wanted to kiss her, to have felt her breasts. She had felt his lips in a caressing touch along her neck. He had felt her skin against him. She had felt his lips on her neck. She had felt his cock inside her.</p> <p>He had felt the fullness of her breasts pressing against him. Her nipples had felt so hard. So hard that they had felt as though they had actually poked through her bra. He had felt her nipple. His cock had felt so hard. He had been amazed at the softness of her breasts. They had felt so wonderful underneath his hand. He had felt the warmth of her breast in his hand. He had felt the softness of her skin. He had wanted to feel the warmth of her skin so close to his.</p> <p>He had felt her breasts all over him. He had wanted her. He had wanted to know her. He had wanted her innocence. He had wanted to feel her naked. To see her naked body, to fuck her. To feel her breasts, to love her breasts.</p> <p>And now, he was fucking her. There wasn't a moment's hesitation in the act of fucking her. There wasn't a moment's hesitation. They had all wanted her. They wanted to have sex. There was no stopping him.</p> <p>They had all wanted this. They had all wanted to make love. To have sex. They had all wanted to make love.</p> <p>And then, they had gone again past into the darkness.</p> <p>As the train continued to accelerate, one hand had reached out and found his waist. With her touch, the feeling of her hand was electric to the touch of his skin. He had felt the softness of her hands so close to his body, so soft, so soft, so delicate, but so wonderfully sensual and sensitive.</p> <p>He had had a moment of hesitation, of doubt, of resistance. But he remembered what would happen if he tried to push the boundaries, if he tried to kiss and him. His way, if he tried to kiss her without her and had he had tried to be with her. And he did he had tried to hold her, to make love her in one another girl to be, had he had, had her instead—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
