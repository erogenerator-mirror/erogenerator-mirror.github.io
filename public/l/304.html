From a Correspondent. Whitby. ONE greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been experienced here, with results both strange and unique. The weather had</strong> settled to a near fever-pitch as stormlets and thunder filled the night, and I was amazed how far things had come.</p> <p>One of the most memorable events of my life happened to me. I was in class on a Monday, and it was a hot night. And there was a very cold wind. I was wearing a white button-down-the-covers suit, dark shoes and socks, and a hat. This really wasn't like anyone I'd ever met as I turned to look at each of the student papers on my desk. On the right was a listing the weather - it was the day of my twentieth birthday. On the left, one of my favorite subjects were studies - on a campus with lots of other people of all ages.</p> <p>My professor, David O'Donnell was a wonderful teacher. He had taught my chemistry class before, but today he was in his lecture hall doing that. And just as always, he was the only one who could always hold out when things were going on. He took notes in my mind, and it was pretty clear that he could probably make me do a whole lot more than sit at my table all day, but I got a real hard-on when he did that. I had to get my books down, but I kept on reading. He stopped after class, and looked at my notes all the way to his next class. He smiled: he liked me that way.</p> <p>I took a deep breath as I took a third class. My class was about chemistry, and he'd had a lot to teach about his own classes. I had been a very good student, and I think he liked it, too. Our midterm came in at four o'clock. I finished up my paper, and I went home and went to bed. I had been reading while I waited, and, when I was asleep, I had this warm, peaceful and content feeling that I knew would grow over time as I continued to write my essays.</p> <p>I fell back to sleep sometime after lunch time. I really hadn't been much of a workaholic, so when I heard the elevator bell, I felt a little nervous about getting caught. I was surprised to be home, though: I never slept on the weekends. It took me a little while to get warm, though, and finally I got up, brushed my hair and the front of my clothes, and went to the kitchen to start breakfast. I ate almost ravenously as soon as I got out of bed.</p> <p>When I got home about half an hour later, I thought about getting my stuff out to shower and change and shower my whole house, and just have a shower. I got a little bit excited when I got home, thinking that I could start my studies by myself.</p> <p>I was startled, however, to find the front door open, and Professor O'Donnell was standing there looking into the living room. He had a big, friendly smile on his face. He was wearing a short, pale gray turtleneck sweater, and blue jeans.</p> <p>"Hi, Professor," I said: "I'm in the kitchen. Can you start the shower for the boys, please?"</p> <p>Professor O'Donnell was one of those guys whose personality was as plain as one could be. He was a smart guy, and like all of those guys who were into athletics and sports and books, he didn't care about the other students. I guess he got that from his father, who taught some physics in high school. Professor O'Donnell wasn't really smart, though, but he was good-looking. Maybe he'd seen a TV show and had been studying for college.</p> <p>"Sure," Professor O'Donnell said: "just let me get my tools." When Professor O'Donnell turned off the hall, I followed him quickly into the living room, where he stood in front of his study table and watched intently while I took my clothes off. He had a really nice body. I felt kind of silly being in the way of that: it was one of Professor O'Donnell's lectures, and he always had to stand in front of students to give directions. When I got completely naked, I was feeling pretty hot: my nipples were standing at attention and my vagina felt as if it was glowing, and I could feel the warm wetness coming out of my vagina, making me even hotter, if that was possible. "Okay," Professor O'Donnell said: "I should use the bathroom when I've finished. That would be helpful, too."</p> <p>"Certainly," I said, walking past him into the living room, which was his study hall. I guessed would be next to his office, and didn't be closer to mine. "down from the door.</p> <p>"Oh, I thought: I think. I think that, though, I just so many thoughts. This is one of him.</p> <p>" I hope.
