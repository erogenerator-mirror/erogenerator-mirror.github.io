Who Stole the Tarts?</h4><p><strong>The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as</strong> their royal consorts. As soon as they got settled, King Michael arrived, and the king was able to start playing. The Queen, the Prince of Hearts, and the Queen of the Knights of Hearts were seated around the dining table. Then with some help from the soldiers, Michael began taking care of the guests as well.</p> <p>As the King and his consort sat around the table, and watched Michael play, the crowd grew even more fanatical. The Knights of Hearts and their royal consort, Michael, were clearly the most popular and exciting of the group, with all the eyes around the room focused on the King's hands, his face, and his big bulging dick. King Edward and her consort, Daniel, were sitting beside the crowd, drinking champagne, watching Michael with the crowd.</p> <p>Suddenly the Princess appeared, flanked by her two closest sisters. Everyone cheered her on, and the crowd roared, saying things like, "Princess, what a beautiful name,"</p> <p>Daniel was the next to say something, and she responded with, "Daniel, are you having fun?" He responded with, "Oh, yes, dear, I'm having very much fun! I can't believe how you are putting all this together!"</p> <p>Now it was Daniel's turn to take on the Princess. Edward was busy talking to her, but Daniel watched carefully. He watched her every move, especially those big tits she seemed to be so proud of. It was Daniel's favorite part of Michael: when he sucked on her boobs, her nipples got so hard it actually hurt.</p> <p>After Daniel finished speaking, the Princess, Daniel and the Princess leaned against Edward's head. Daniel leaned back so he could watch him sucking her tits. She didn't seem to care, but she did press her chest into him. With a moan, Daniel looked up at her, and said, "Wow, Princess. It's too bad your tits are so big. I really don't care. You can have the biggest set of tits around. But, they are mine, and I'm going to enjoy them!"</p> <p>The crowd erupted with applause and cheered for him, and Daniel was glad to see it. He loved to suck on the Princess' big boobs. She loves it too, too!</p> <p>The King and Queen had their drinks as well. Now it was Daniel's turn to have the Princess. Daniel stood to the side of the throne, and said, "It looks like a long conversation," as he took off his crown. It seemed to take forever for him to get the King's head down to the Princess' boobs. Finally it wasn't as long as he thought it would be, but it was long enough for her to feel something.</p> <p>After Daniel pulled his head back a little, she moaned slightly in excitement as Daniel gave her the best lap dance she ever had. He was just able to stand and hold her and not crush her. The Princess' boobs were firm and round—she wasn't huge anymore, but still looked good to him. After a few more beats, Daniel's crown was off, and he held his arms behind his head.</p> <p>Then in surprise, the Princess suddenly pulled her tits back from Daniel's lips. Daniel was glad he hadn't done that on purpose, because he really hated being forced to do that. The Princess leaned forward, and brought her hands around to her tits. She started rubbing them, as Daniel was moving to put one nipple in his mouth, then the other.</p> <p>Daniel was mesmerized watching her.</p> <p>"I thought it was going to be a long talk," Daniel whispered to the Princess.</p> <p>"I'm sure it will be," She responded with a smile, as she put her hands on Daniel's head and started pressing him onto her boobs. "Do you have a favourite?"</p> <p>Daniel got up from his stool and pulled Daniel over to the Princess. On his knees, Daniel leaned back on the chair. The Princess took his huge erection into her mouth and started sucking on it. She continued sucking for a few minutes before pulling off, and saying, "Enough of the long talk. Come on, let's fuck!"</p> <p>Daniel was in shock for a moment, as the Princess grabbed his shoulders and brought his dick back into her mouth. Then she started grinding her tight little butt on the King. Daniel could tell they were in sync, and he felt her pussy lips on the shaft of his cock. He moved forward a little, and reached down with both hands, grabbing the princess' beautiful buns and pulling her crotch against his cock. She responded by humping back against him.</p> <p>Daniel was amazed that his dick was so soft. "I thought I was going to die at this point," he thought to himself.</p> <p>The Princess, she let goof her buns come and his arms and "Oh no kiss again, and the Princess, Daniel."</p> <p>No don't no go—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
