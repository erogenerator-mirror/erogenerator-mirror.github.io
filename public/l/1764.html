A TEAR FOR A DROP OF WATER.</h4><p><strong>These words were, so to speak, the point of union of two scenes, which had, up to that time, been developed in parallel lines at the same moment, each on</strong> the same night. As an added note, in the first to follow, we are at what might be known the end of those lines: 'to fuck'.</p> <p>There is much to be done and some serious things to think about at this point. For instance, a couple of other phrases are not suitable words for what would lead up to each other, but perhaps this first of it's inane statement is worth saying: "'to fuck' is a good word' is a good word, as well.</p> <p>Now, a couple more of those phrases in which we make good use of the words 'to fuck' and 'to take' are: 'to be fucked', 'be fucked' by anyone who is at the very least somewhat experienced in taking a cock into their ass, and 'to be fucked' by anyone who can get into their ass.</p> <p>For instance, a couple of more words which can't be used to describe the actual act of cock-fucking that we know so well are: 'to cum' and 'to drink cum'.</p> <p>The other phrase is: 'to eat cum'.</p> <p>There are some phrases which can become important additions to our repertoire if we are all of us thinking about it. Like: 'be a slut and fuck for all the men in the world'.</p> <p>Those phrases can be used to describe men at the very least. They are in the same league.</p> <p>For some of those phrases and phrases, you may find them extremely offensive, particularly when they are spelled out so crudely in terms of a man's penis-swelling or cocks-swelling.</p> <p>For these phrases, some men say or think that they feel like having their semen splattered all over the faces and clothes of other men.</p> <p>For those phrases, however, they are often just nasty.</p> <p>You may use these phrases when you are not talking about them. It's one of the things that can be useful for saying these words when they are in reference to one or all of your fellow men in reference to those things.</p> <p>For these phrases, your use of them is not important because they are used to encourage. They are for you to read. Because they are used in reference to those men who are being fucked by other men that are not you:</p> <p>'To take,'</p> <p>'To suck,'</p> <p>'To take and drink,'</p> <p>'To suck and drink' are phrases used to give men some oral pleasure or to encourage you to take things further and drink.</p> <p>When you are saying these words, they are referring to your own cocksucking.</p> <p>Do not confuse it with "to have", but rather refer to 'to suck and drink'." In these words you may have the same thoughts about sucking or drinking men to see to your own cocksucking.</p> <p>You may have even the idea that it is a very good thing that you and your cock sucking audience are talking about you as opposed to a man in general.</p> <p>Some men have a thing about being told not to cum unless, with permission of the other man, they are given permission to cum. Some of you might even feel that you are being turned on by the idea of being turned on by the fact that you are being told not to cum without permission, but they are merely saying that they are willing members of the audience who want to make the best of things, and are actually encouraging what is about to happen to you: You're just being yourself.</p> <p>You may have an idea that you're being turned on by having a man in your mouth, but you are saying things about your cocksucking without having the cocks of your audience in reference.</p> <p>You do not have to say anything for a while. All you have to do is to be quiet, for it's not hard not to say the phrases you use, and, after a while, enjoy saying them to yourself.</p> <p>There is more, so for now, that can be accomplished.</p> <p>There is more, but the first several phrases can become much more descriptive in those respects.</p> <p>To take and take, for example: 'to take' is used to have, if you want it, said.</p> <p>For the other phrase: 'to eat cum' is used to mean eating semen.</p> <p>For the first thing I should note about using these phrases is that if you choose that they are "to look at", the usage you use of these phrases might also be a bit unusual, because they are not intended purely for their readers' benefit.</p> <p>What can I tell you, really, about how to use these phrases, what the readers? In short-of, to say or quote or think about these phrases:</p> <p></p> <p>This is to eat cum or drink or to eat or to suck. You. And drink or to suck.</p> <p>to suck to drink, to suck or take be from yourâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
