The pain of separation, however,</strong> was quickly overcome, as he was unable to attend to a business meeting. With his mind as barren as a desert, he wandered to the bed chamber where his lover awaited.</p> <p>"Wake me, you bastard," she growled with a gilded smile. "I need your cock inside me, and I need you to fuck me," she murmured.</p> <p>When he returned, on his back on the large bed, she was on top of him in seconds. With all the foreplay he'd given her with her tongue and fingers, she was still hot and hungry and ready to devour him.</p> <p>"I am so hot for you!" she whined. "You make me so hot! Please fuck me!"</p> <p>He couldn't have cared less if that was a line he used whenever they were together. She was insatiable and she was insatiable and she was insatiable while he was nowhere near ready for her. But the need to penetrate her in anyway was clear in his eyes.</p> <p>He slid between her legs with his big black erection ready to pierce her. She wrapped her long legs around him and her head tilted back as he entered her.</p> <p>"I can't believe how good you feel inside me," she cooed. "Your big black cock is so big it makes all my pussy want to be fucked!"</p> <p>"I love being so fucking full of you," he whispered to her, as he began to pump into her.</p> <p>"My pussy needs a cock every morning!" she whimpered in reply. "I need big black cock in me every day!"</p> <p>He kissed her, as he pumped into her. He could feel every nook and cranny of her body. Her breasts hung low, her face buried into his chest, her hips moving in unison, her thighs clenching around him as he fucked her.</p> <p>In his delirium, he almost forgot that the alarm clock in his pocket was downstairs.</p> <p>"I'm sorry!" she whispered in his ear. "I didn't mean to wake you this way. But I need you in me every other morning!"</p> <p>She held his face, her lips kissed him deeply as she wrapped her arms about him, her legs still locked around his waist.</p> <p>"I need you, too, Mr. Collins," she whispered. "I need you so fucking much. I'm so fucking horny."</p> <p>"I'm ready to fuck," he gasped. "I'm so ready to make love."</p> <p>"Mmmmm," she moaned. "I need you so much. I need you."</p> <p>His cock felt like magic. Every part of her was tingling and every muscle in her body was alive under his touch. She didn't want to stop. They had barely begun their lovemaking when they were kissing so deeply the sounds from the other's lips became muffled and faint. They continued fucking for hours in the dark, oblivious to the sound their mouths made.</p> <p>Finally they were finished. They were both exhausted, yet they were still connected. He could feel every muscle of his body, every pulse, every blood vessel in his cock. He was exhausted, she could feel him inside her; he had never felt anything this good to her before.</p> <p>"You really love me?" she asked.</p> <p>"Oh, I love you, love you," he answered her as she wrapped her legs high around his waist. "I love you, I love you, I love you."</p> <p>"I love you, love you," she chanted in his ear. "I love you, I love you, I love you."</p> <p>"I love you, love you," he repeated and repeated until it came to him that he meant it.</p> <p>Their lovemaking continued for a week as Charlotte's body ached for more. Finally, on the night of the Christmas holiday, they were at a party. The party turned out to be as boring as the usual party; the usual music was deafening as the majority of the partygoers were the same people who had spent their life in the same party.</p> <p>"Mr. Collins, you've done so good tonight, I don't know if I'll ever get over it," she said. "I haven't felt like this for a long time—ever."</p> <p>"How long?" he sighed. "What have I missed?"</p> <p>"I don't know how long this can last, but the more I think about it, the more I want to go out every year. We have a month left, and you can come visit, if you like, if you want to. I'd rather not be stuck in this state with you in the middle age gap I've found me in," she said as she strode down on the porch.</p> <p>"You look at the ceiling, Mr.</p> <p>" look at the ceiling—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
