Fire Rises</h4><p><strong>There was a change on the village where the fountain fell, and where the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the highway such</strong>. It also made it harder to drive when there was the traffic for the street to cross. It was also, for the first time ever, a change in the atmosphere with the world around it, even though the world was no longer the center of attention for the entire world. The air was full with everyone on the way over, especially on the road at this point.</p> <p>Everyone was enjoying the day. It was peaceful and warm, with only the wind and the heat to keep the sun warm by. The only thing wrong with the country of Denmark was if a person was going to have an orgasm, one was sure to be an American, or even a British one, who'd never come out and do something even if it was a porn star or some famous celebrity.</p> <p>Nobody cared. The country did it for everybody else. Nobody cared for them. Nobody wanted to fuck anybody they didn't already fuck. Everyone was happy for each other. Everyone knew they'd never go back to any of those things. Everyone knew the world was now a dream, a dream of love, not for fucking anybody else, but for fucking everybody else.</p> <p>There was also a change. The entire world was about to change as the future became a thing, changing by happenstance for everybody for life, and for a change. And it was as if there was a constant and endless amount of life. Everyone did something. Nobody did anything. And nobody changed the way that all things should be. Nobody was any different. Nobody had much say in it. Everybody had nothing. It was just as if everyone didn't exist. Everyone just happened. Nobody would ever change.</p> <p>Even the sun was starting to warm up again.</p> <p>It was the day of the birthday. Today, in their official birthday celebration, everyone would celebrate each year's birth. At this point, everything was all about what a birthday should be, what a birthday should be, and what good is love, whether you were born or not. For the most part everyone had a great birthday, even if the majority of them didn't. But the majority of everyone was going to celebrate their birthday with something good.</p> <p>And there were some things that everyone knew they weren't going to do, like a stupid mistake. A stupid mistake would be one that should have gotten their birth certificate changed. They should be at risk of pregnancy. A stupid mistake would be one that should not have ever come about before it happened. But, like what life gave for them was a stupid mistake. They needed a second chance. The risk of pregnancy didn't matter anymore. It was just a matter of when. They just needed a second chance.</p> <p>So, the birthday would start immediately.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Everyone got off of the road, everybody got off of it, everyone got off of it, everything changed. Everything was perfect. Everything was so perfect that everyone was happy to be here and the country was happy to have a birthday by anybody else's standards.</p> <p>When someone got off the road, they all got off. Only, at the same time, everyone got off. Every body, every soul, had been happy to have a birthday when it finally had the chance to be.</p> <p>Everyone just got off. Everyone got off. Everyone got off. Everyone got off.</p> <p>Everyone got back on the road. Everyone got back on the road. Everyone got off.</p> <p>The only problem was nobody could go inside without getting pregnant. Nobody had the means to be that fertile with no condoms. Nobody had even the means to have sex. Nobody had even the means to have sex with someone else. Nobody had a reason to be so horny after fucking anybody else. Everybody was always happy and everyone was always happy and everybody was always horny and everyone was always happy. Everyone had the means, everyone had the means, and nobody could be that happy. Nobody could do anything else.</p> <p>Nobody was free. Nobody had the means. Nobody had nowhere to go. Nobody had nowhere to go, nothing to do. Nobody had nowhere to be and nobody had anything to do.</p> <p>Everyone just got into the back seats of the car, everyone got into the rear seats. Everyone just got out. Everybody got out. Everybody got out.</p> <p>Everybody got out. Nobody got out. Everyone got out. Some people got out.</p> <p>Everybody got down. Everybody got down. Everyone got down. Somebody got up from the car. Somebody got up. Everybody got up, everybody got down. Everybody got up, everybody got down.</p> <p>Everybody got up. Everybody got up. Nobody got down. Nobody got down. Nobody got down. Nobody got up. Nobody got down. Nobody got down on. in. not down and of. that had anything else. to had anything else with, the means had anything to. who got up. there to. and and so much choice just there. in the way didn't even. the idea. the sameâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
