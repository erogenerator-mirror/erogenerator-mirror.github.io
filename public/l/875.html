There was no putting off the day that advanced—the bridal day; and all preparations for its arrival</strong> were done before its inevitable conclusion.</p> <p>Her fingers moved to stroke the skin of his cheek as he leaned back against the wall. His brow was drawn up into a half frown and he stared out the window while he considered the question.</p> <p>"Does your girlfriend still love you?" His brow was drawn higher into the darkness and he was watching it with a look of fear as he looked out at the night. "If she doesn't, she sure doesn't want—"</p> <p>"Don't ask me what?" She raised up on her toes and kissed him, her tongue dancing over his. Their lips came together and he felt the kiss grow more passionate. His lips parted, the heat of his mouth on hers. She could feel her body relax as he wrapped his arms around the curve of her waist and squeezed her closer. Their lips parted and she felt his hand brush up between her breasts. His hands came over her breasts to caress her nipples that grew hard under his touch. "Is it over?" She asked him with a smile before she kissed him again. She could feel the urgency of his body against hers and she squeezed his bottom before she leaned back against the wall, her fingers digging into his shoulder and pulling him closer. "Is it over?" Her question was punctuated by a deep, passionate kiss as she felt him stiffen with a shudder.</p> <p>"Yes," He whispered in her ear as he kissed it just as hard. "I need to."</p> <p>"I know you do," she cooed as she pushed him over against the bed. "Get on your back," She hissed, holding out her arms to allow him to lie down. He moved between her legs and she pulled up the skirt of her gown to sit facing away from him, exposing herself to him. "I know you want me," she breathed, her voice barely a whisper as she lowered her hands to caress the skin of her outer lips. "I know you want to." She kissed him again as her fingers played between her fingers to stroke the skin as they glistened wetly in the light. She felt his body shivering as she ran the tips of her fingers and his lips over her body. "Let me have you," she purred. "Let me make you crazy." She felt his lips suck at her nipple and she moaned once again, a deep, guttural moan that rose and fell in pitch as he sucked on her breasts. She felt his tongue lick and slide down her belly to circle at the top of it, moving under the swell of her belly, dipping inside her lips on its way back into her pussy before he pulled away again, just the tip of his tongue flicking over her clit. He kissed her lower stomach before lowering his mouth to her soft, silky pussy. She groaned, her body responding to the gentle caress of his lips and tongue. He sucked her clit into his mouth and she moaned, her body shuddering with a sensation of pleasure that she was unable to understand.</p> <p>He let the pressure of the kiss build in her, and she had to stop him again, but he wasn't going to stop. The kisses began again on the sides of her lips, and they were becoming more passionate, more aggressive.</p> <p>"I want you," His voice was breathy and she could sense the growing heat growing between them.</p> <p>"Oh yes," She moaned, and she pushed him over onto his back before she knelt down. "Yes."</p> <p>"Let me taste you," He whispered as he reached down to lay on his side on the bed. She lay down beside him, but in the darkness of the room he could imagine his hand sliding back down to her wet pussy. She moaned before she moved to lie back, her hand sliding between her legs to caress him before she took hold of him with her hand and directed him to her. "Please," He said when she was lined up with him, and his voice echoed the sentiment in her mind at the feel of his cock filling her. "Please."</p> <p>"Be still and let me give you," she murmured, her hand gliding up and down between them. "Please."</p> <p>"Is this not like any good experience?" He asked, his voice rumbling in his throat as she felt him push up into her. She closed her eyes against the light and kissed him, moving her hand back to guide him in. "Don't stop," she begged, her voice deep and raspy.</p> <p>"Tell me how it feels," He insisted as much was driving him crazy as it was giving him a taste of pure ecstasy.</p> <p>"It feels so good," She agreed.</p> <p>"I can I wish you like if it doesn't stop," He asked," He finished the question.</p> <p></p> <p>"No."Say," Say, can," no," do it's good," then you like you—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
