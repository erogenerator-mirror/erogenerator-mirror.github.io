Her joy and expression</strong> took him a little by surprise as soon as he turned and entered her bedroom. He had her bra and panties off as soon as he got in and they were soon both lying on the bed together.</p> <p>She leaned into him and started kissing him passionately while she began slowly rocking on his shaft, giving himself an even better view of her breasts and nipples and he saw all her hard nipples become erect almost instantly as his lips and her breasts got fully engaged with each other. It was quite a turn-on standing there beside one of the finest breasts of every female he had ever been with, and just being able to see them both made his heart accelerate. He moved his hands over her breasts and down to her ass and started kneading her buttocks and pulled her on him more actively, making her moan.</p> <p>After a couple of minutes, she raised herself up from her breasts and rolled on a condom; this let him feel fully at home in every place he'd ever been, the way a man was able to feel. As she mounted him, she began to stroke his penis with one hand as she kissed him and fondled and massaged his testicles with the other. Her body shuddered almost violently.</p> <p>After a minute or two of this, she sat up and rolled around in the bed on her stomach with her bottom pointing toward him, putting her feet behind his thighs. Leaning a bit forward, in one smooth movement, she spread her legs and began sliding the rubber over his penis. It slid deep as he entered, making him feel like he'd never been, especially since he had already cum twice in the bathroom at the club earlier today.</p> <p>"I can't believe this" he murmured, his heart really beating very fast as he saw her backside moving so that the condom slipped easily over her butt and into her vagina. She pushed her bottom back toward him as he did this, so his legs also felt even better, a bit like a little dance partner.</p> <p>Her back arched as she slid forward and began riding his penis again, a bit of pleasure running through her. She felt so sexy and sensual. If she would have said that before at the club, she would have said it would also have made her feel sexy and sexy and sexy and naughty and dirty and wicked and naughty, but it never came to that. It was just the way she was.</p> <p>He had his arms round her waist and felt her skin beneath them, just as he had imagined. His lower chest was still on her breast, but his dick just felt the same thing; she felt so good. He couldn't really say anything, he just kissed her head and neck.</p> <p>"It's okay, baby" she said, in what sounded like a dream. "It's okay to be in charge here, I'm so comfortable about this."</p> <p>"It feels incredible" he replied, feeling his heart still beating a bit faster as he kissed her ear. She smiled at him as he kissed her head and neck, and her body responded to him with more and more pleasure.</p> <p>She sat up and put her legs, still spread, on her arms and her arms in front a head up, so her feet were pointing skyward. He took this as an invitation and leaned forward on his elbows, keeping his penis deep in her. They kissed just like that forever, his kisses getting more and more passionate and passionate, his penis sliding around in her. His hands caressed her back, her bottom, her thighs, her bottom, and her head. She moaned and cried out in pleasure as they made love.</p> <p>When he reached around her and felt the softness of her thighs on his hands, he was happy. This was her first time with a man, and she was a complete woman, so he decided that sex was the main event and this sex was going to be an experience for them both. However, he didn't think he could stop from trying to convince her to be anything less than what he wanted her to be.</p> <p>Mrs. Dashwood had to let it out, she felt so alive. It didn't feel fake. She could see he was in a state of pure lust and she felt the same. She wanted him to get her to fuck him harder, to make love to her, to go through this with her in real life again, to make every thing they had been going for, everything they had ever wanted, meant the same. She was completely at the mercy of her husband. They were the luckiest couple in the world of two couples made completely and completely in love, but in the same moment as they had been in the throes of lovemaking for several months, they could have become a true item on the entire Earth, and even, one.</p> <p>"Yes, yes, yes, yes, I feel it", fuck me, fuck, I love my wifeâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
