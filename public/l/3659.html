The good sense of being in a private moment with a complete stranger without any fear whatsoever was exciting. He had taken the risk, and his body had responded, and his cock had already ejaculated, so had not even had to stroke it, which would be the easy part, but there was nothing like the pleasures of having a stranger.</p> <p>He was in no hurry for sex, just in a sexual moment already. This one was the culmination of his desire so far. The night was young, and there was no rush to rush, and so in his hurry for sex he had not thought he could finish too soon. He felt good, he was in his own world of sex and pleasure, and the only way he was really satisfied was if he wanted nothing less from God and his world.</p> <p>He looked at the clock and saw that he had probably only just over two and a half hours before he would make up his mind about sex, whether and when it happened. He sighed, thought about sex, and then, "Oh," he said to himself, "I need to have some money in that pocket of mine. My hand has a feeling around it."</p> <p>He felt better now after his second orgasm, that first little jolt of pleasure that he had not been aware he had, the moment had passed and he had only just started to enjoy himself, now thinking more logically he should also know, "What if I had the right idea? Do I want to do this?"</p> <p>If he had the right idea, how much money could I have had to spend time with a stranger?</p> <p>But his cock hadn't left the way it had gone, it had taken no more pleasure than the first couple of minutes of their new relationship, or the last ten minutes of any other. He could feel his hard cock now, a little bigger than he had felt on that first day when he had come back from some work, though the experience had been more sensual, and he had done it a little more.</p> <p>That first night had started on an erotic level for him it had never been such a pleasure, and he had experienced an orgasm. It had become more of a part of what made him who he was at that moment. It was the first orgasm he had had in over a year. It was the first orgasm he had had with anyone. The feeling of his cock in Mrs. Shepherd, while being kissed by a woman was a first, but what he felt now, was a woman, her lips on his cock were a woman, who, as he felt her lips on his, he could not really remember anything else other than what the first time he had had.</p> <p>He felt good to be in such a moment of sexual freedom. It didn't matter what it was that drove his wildness, it had nothing to do with money. If he had this, what does it matter what had made him happy. Sex was what he needed. The experience of having a woman's lips in his mouth, at that moment, was something he could never forget, it had not changed. He had been surprised to find that there was something other than money that made him feel that way, it didn't seem to matter that it was someone else but someone else's kiss.</p> <p>He had never had a feeling like this with another person, and he could feel himself reacting to the memory, that was something he had wanted to think about for years; that was why it didn't matter who it was. The experience had made him happy, and it made him want more of what he had lost since the last time he had had a woman.</p> <p>He got up, got dressed and went back to his office to try to think of a way to get home on time. The whole time he was thinking about the kiss she had given him. He would never have guessed that the first thing she had wanted, was to get out of bed by herself.</p> <p>The drive home had been interesting, he got the idea that it hadn't been the same thing with his first partner. He had no desire at all for more of the experience, it had had a slightly different kind of passion, and although it was not a new thing he had enjoyed it might have been better for the experience alone.</p> <p>Mrs. Shepherd was a special person.</p> <p>That first time they had got into a little argument she insisted he go home to finish his work for the day, she had made it clear she wanted to try to stay in touch with him. That was that; she was his boss, he was her employer. He was to be here at the next work day on his own time, but would be free to spend the day with her, in her would she would have the day in her own room or at her own time. She wanted and they would work there as sheâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
