My friends, all who have seen me naked, were waiting in the auditorium on my arrival. We were all dressed in their school clothes, and were getting ready to meet them for the first of our lectures. Then he called me to his desk which was situated on the bottom of the class room floor.</p> <p>"Let's give a good reception," was the only thing that I heard when I entered.</p> <p>"Hi, Mr. Smith," I began, "I am a professor of anthropology. I feel as if I have a student, but you're the one who invited me."</p> <p>"I'm a professor of anthropology now," he replied, smiling, "and I'm sure you will be pleased to learn what you've been missing with your boring classes the past couple of months."</p> <p>"I have been disappointed to find no one on earth to share my life with," I continued, "but that's not the worst of the bad."</p> <p>"Let me tell you a lesson here," he added, "If it isn't a real class, and it's not one that you can talk to, why the hell not. If I can teach you something, you can learn it yourself, I can guarantee that."</p> <p>"What kind of lesson?" I asked, but not wanting to be a complete novice. I didn't expect this. He said every lesson was a little different, but I had just to be prepared.</p> <p>"This," he said, "is why you are here."</p> <p>"Oh, Mr. Smith," I said, suddenly feeling shy, "I wasn't prepared for this part of the class."</p> <p>"Oh, you were," he said, and then paused, "You were a little shy."</p> <p>At that moment it hit like a slap in the face. We both looked at each other with big grins. Mr. Smith was the most beautiful man I had ever met. I was the luckiest senior around. I had to say thanks to him for bringing me into this. My life is better than a thousand different parts.</p> <p>"I'm surprised," I said, while trying to hide how embarrassed I feel, "I have never done anything like this before."</p> <p>"It's okay, dear," he continued, "You can tell me."</p> <p>"Oh, no, I didn't mean it. I was thinking of the pleasures of sex." I could feel my heart beating as I spoke. I had never realized that I had never experienced anything of that nature before. I felt my face heating up.</p> <p>"You're not a virgin?" I heard him ask before I could complete the sentence, then felt his tongue sliding into my ear.</p> <p>"No, not at all," I said, "It's just that I've never had a boyfriend before. You are not a virgin."</p> <p>"How do you feel now?" he asked in a sexy voice, which almost gave me an orgasm immediately. His voice had an accent, of something like Hawaiian.</p> <p>"It's just that the way you are looking at me, I'm kind of freaked out." It made his voice sound sexy, as long-time acquaintances who had met one's friends often talked in between lectures that he was in class. It made me feel very sexy.</p> <p>"I'm going to make you something to eat this evening," he said, "It's not for school, but a special occasion."</p> <p>"Mmmm, that sounds romantic," I said. It felt so good.</p> <p>"But for now we will have something in common," he said, "and it's time you started practicing."</p> <p>"Oh, I will practice," I said, and he just smiled to me.</p> <p>"Now," he continued, "I'm going to take you back to your dorm and you will go take your first ever shower."</p> <p>I'm going to make you my shower, she thought to himself, as I followed him. He led me to his bed, and we gently pushed me down on top and then he lay me down. He kissed me and then took his cock in his hand and gently guided it into me.</p> <p>"Slowly," I said to him, "you have to be patient."</p> <p>He slowly and steadily began pumping his big cock into me, going in inch by inch. Then it was an unbelievable feeling: the whole length of him was pushing into my body, but not all the way. It felt very good being inside of a virgin. Andro. It was as tight as usual. The big as ever. After a virgin.</p> <p></p> <p>andro could fuck, like a virgin. I thought to myself.
