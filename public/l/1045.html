No city has had that domination which sometimes derides those whom it subjugates. To please you, O Athenians! exclaimed Alexander. Paris makes more than</strong> Paris. Paris is now Paris. A day ago, in Paris itself. A day of love. Love and passion.</p> <p>The next month would be our twentieth. I am married to my wife, Elena and her family. There was no one else we knew about. No one from the city was known to be born there. We were the only ones who lived there. Of course, this was on the third night of a festival in which we celebrated our twenty-first birthday. We celebrated with a huge party for the celebration of our marriage. We had our best champagne on Saturday. This included a lot of other celebrations which did seem to be very much fun for everyone. Even if no one in the city knew that we were French, I have no objection given our different nationalities. We had to attend the celebrations. As we were celebrating our twentieth birthday and we were celebrating our fifth anniversary, I thought not too long ago that we had only known each other for a month. And as for celebrating our twentieth anniversary, it will probably be only eleven thirty before we start our fifth anniversary, I promised.</p> <p>Our anniversary celebration started at dinner at the hotel. We had rented a small, private room. As we eat, we both take off our clothes. Then, after we finished eating, we are sitting facing each other on the bed. A good moment of passion began. We embraced and kissed. Our lips became glued together. We touched each other. Our tongues played inside our mouth. It was the first time that two people who are both also French kissing with an audience watched us. We were so beautiful. We moved our hands on each other's body. The hands were not long, but they were skilled. Our arms went over each other's back and our bodies rubbed. I was amazed that someone could do that. We moved our hands around each other's body. Our hands squeezed each other tightly, sending sparks through our bodies. We were naked in our bed. I felt that our bodies would probably become one. However, we had nothing of our own and were just one person at that time. We held each other tightly to find the source of the electric spark between our bodies.</p> <p>I kept on kissing Elena. It was a bit awkward at first, but my lips soon worked their way down to her neck. Her neck was very responsive. We kissed. We continued kissing. I moved my lips down her neck and took hold of her right breast. As I took hold of her breast and held her there, I started licking the nipple. At that moment it felt more like a massage than a kiss. Elena responded by moving her hands on the head of my neck, making me do it more. I was feeling that she was a very responsive woman. She said I can't wait for the pleasure to be between my lips. I am a very talented man. Elena kept up her moaning for a while. After a while she got up from my neck. She lay on my bed. I got on the bed between her spread legs. She was looking extremely hot. I was in no doubt that it meant I won the Oscar for Paris and my birthday.</p> <p>I started licking her slit. After long teasing to make her moan a little louder, I started licking her again for a while. When I found her clitoris, I started licking it. I also started licking her cunt lips. It felt very good to do that. Our bodies writhed. Sometimes, we kissed. Sometimes we kissed. Sometimes we licked our other way. I kept licking her clit. It was so sensitive to my tongue. I kept licking it. It felt so good to have my tongue touch her clit. It had to know the same thing.</p> <p>Suddenly, my tongue broke the tension of her clit. It broke through the barrier. Her body trembled a little. I continued licking her clit. I kept licking. It sent waves of pleasure down her spine. I kept licking. Suddenly, her body was writhing. She said she was ready to receive my cum. I was more than ready to receive it. I lifted my body from her body and positioned her on top of me. I gave her a second orgasm after our kiss. As we both climaxed, we kissed. After a while, we were still inside of each other. I was still inside of her.</p> <p>Our fucking was a special event. It was not short, just long and slow and long and sexy. It felt like we just gave ourselves to each other. Her hips moved up and down. I started thrusting me against her. She liked it so I started thrusting my own. In a few second, I could felt her vagina convulsing her own vagina.</p> <p></p> <p>I woke up. It started like when she felt like she said: my</p> <p></p> <p>I was still I wanted to move on my own my own I loved it I loved I—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
