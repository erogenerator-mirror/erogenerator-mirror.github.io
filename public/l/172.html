Nightgown.</h4><p><strong>We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine, and then drawing them back;</strong> we fucked in her bed. But the reason for the interruption was to check on the time and time again. We hadn't fucked yet. It would be a good five and a half hours before I had to leave, so there was plenty of time to take a piss, and then get home again, if necessary.</p> <p>"Ohh, fuck...what are you doing over there, sweetie?" she said, when she came into the room. "And you're naked and in bed with me and you're so fucking horny."</p> <p>I got up to take my shower. I didn't want to leave the bed, but she was right – there were more than enough bedrooms in every one downstairs, and we both could do things with the walls and ceiling at any time. I didn't want to ruin her illusion by going for a pee and getting myself in trouble. Besides, I was glad I didn't have a stiffy in my underwear tonight.</p> <p>After I got my shower, I made a mental note to get off my towel when I had my turn, knowing it would likely be an erection most of the week. I found some clothes that I'd worn a while ago and piled them up on the chair, then went downstairs to put on a pair of boxers and a t-shirt. They were pink and were really cute.</p> <p>"So, how was your day?" she asked. I was standing at the sink.</p> <p>"It was okay, actually," I answered. "I spent over an hour with the guys from the accounting firm," I answered as I got out the clothes and put them on. "And I got into some of their little games."</p> <p>"Oh."</p> <p>They were, um, fun. But I wasn't sure if they were good enough, so I didn't really push it. "So...since you guys seem too happy with yourselves, then do you want to have a go?"</p> <p>"Sure," he answered. "You're the guest of honor tonight."</p> <p>"Oh, you're the guest of honor too", I smirked. "So I'll do it."</p> <p>"Well, you know how you used to pick me up on the subway one time?"</p> <p>"I do?"</p> <p>"Yeah. What do you think?"</p> <p>"I think you're hot..."</p> <p>"Well, that's good!" I said, and I picked her up and threw her down on the bed, right on top of me, and we started making out. It was hot. It was fucking hot. It was hot. We were making out. I got her naked and started feeling her up all over. I was feeling her tits. I ran my hands over her pussy lips, then down her ass crack. Her pussy lips were still a little swollen from last night, but there were still some drops of juices leaking from her pussy. Maybe it was my imagination, or maybe it was her. I found her clit, and started teasing her lips. I'd find out later that it was not as prominent as it was the first time, and maybe I was an amateur at my work, but whatever. It was as fun as it was in real life.</p> <p>"Don't you think it's good that you're the main attraction today?" she asked.</p> <p>"Mm hmm," I agreed. "That makes two of us."</p> <p>"Don't you think so?"</p> <p>"I guess."</p> <p>"So, what happens now..."</p> <p>She had no problem with it; we were both going to get naked, and her doing the first thing with me having the right opportunity. I liked that. I really liked having the chance to have the chance to have a woman over my bed, and fuck her. "C'mon, baby," I moaned. "Fuck me."</p> <p>She didn't really hesitate. She slid her shirt up over her head, and she unhooked her bra quickly, leaving her bra to go. I got off the bed and went after her shirt. When she was naked, I grabbed her from behind and turned her around. She was now facing me, and she kissed me as I kissed her. Our sex organs were still talking, but nothing else was said. She wanted me, and I wanted her, so we were kissing just as ardently.</p> <p>Suddenly, I felt her wet tongue slide down my neck and trail around my nipples. I arched my back so she could have easy access to all of my body parts. I got to where I wanted to take off her clothes, but I wanted to take her to bed first. I wanted her to have it first time with my own first time, and to have sex-age. This first sex with a woman. Shemale first time and sex: first sex with woman.</p> <p></p> <p>"Can you"Can I'll be mine.
