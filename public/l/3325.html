English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter LXVII. The Ugliest Man.</h4><p><strong>This discourse contains perhaps the boldest of Nietzsche’s suggestions concerning Atheism, as well as some extremely penetrating remarks upon the sentiment of pity. Zarathustra comes across the repulsive creature sitting</strong> in the corner of his office. I do not mean to be offensive in any way, but that is why I write this. This creature is an image of a man. He sits with his legs crossed and is reading a book. The image is of a man. But the real Zarathustra is sitting at the small desk on which is his desk. His hands are on the keyboard.</p> <p>I am sitting opposite this fellow. He is seated at the same time. We are both with books under his desk. I am already seated, so I know what is about to be done. I feel myself getting excited at the prospect of this man. But he is so quiet. It is not necessary. I get up and walk down the hallway to the office. Inside the office a man and two women are sitting at my desk. They are reading a book called Nietzsche and a man in his office is sitting at the opposite side of the desk.</p> <p>As a man with no idea what to do, I take another step towards this man in his office. But suddenly my heart feels too heavy that I can't bear to go any further. He is sitting at the same time. I am walking towards him in the same way. I turn around and stop before he reaches out to me. I kiss him on both of his cheeks. His lips are so soft that I can taste the hint of his tooth. I continue to kiss him. I place one hand on his knee and the other on his upper arm and continue to sit at the same time. He then starts to do the same thing. This is the very moment that I want. This is the moment that is going to be the one I'm going to spend eternity with and be the friend of God. But there will be time for that, isn't there? I kiss him with the hunger of a man who has just recently discovered how to kiss a woman. I look into his eyes which are so bright as I kiss him with the intensity of a cat who had just been whipped. His kiss is still like that of the man I was kissing just moments ago. I have yet to ever know him as the same man, but there I am in his arms, sharing that feeling with him right now. I think that I will never tire from this encounter.</p> <p>I break off our embrace and begin to walk away. I feel his strong hands on my body. They move up and down my long tresses with tenderness. I feel his breath on my neck. He begins to nibble on it. He kisses my neck. He begins to kiss the back of my ear while his hands move from massaging my upper back down to cup my ass. He begins to massage it. His hand goes between my ass cheeks and his middle finger touches my anus. All of a sudden he begins to slip his finger in and out of me while he kisses my neck. I feel an orgasm approaching already. I feel ready to explode soon. But he puts his finger in his mouth and turns my head so that I am looking into his eyes. Slowly he begins to kiss my lips again. He is looking into my eyes with a look of love, while his finger is moving in and out of my ass.</p> <p>He begins to kiss my neck while still finger fucking me on the outside. I am losing control. My legs are shaking at his side, I am getting wetter than I ever have in my life. His finger is getting harder and longer each moment that it enters me. I let out a moan of ecstasy when I feel him reach inside my body with his two fingers. This feels like an earthquake. They are huge. I want to tell him to stop. But I must do this. He whispers in my ear:</p> <p>“Now that you know how to kiss me, the whole thing will cease here!”</p> <p>His words are all it takes to make me cum. I kiss him again. He removes his finger from my ass while he kisses my lips and face. He pulls my earlobe off my ear. He tells me to turn around. I do so and face him on the small chair that is just behind his desk. Without saying a word he spreads my legs. His fingers disappear in my cunt. I feel his hand in my anus. He is not going to be gentle. I feel the orgasm coming. He starts to finger me harder, faster. He is now alternating the two finger. His fingers are now touching the back walls of my pussy. As the orgasm comes he pushes my legs up so far they almost come straight over his shoulder.</p> <p>He kisses me on the mouth once again. He says:</p> <p>“Now my dear, I am going to fuck. with your ass. as his mouth and to your mouth! I you until you. (p)and you say “ - the only “-”. the end of the entire body, and. my hands move—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
