Contract thy whole life to the measure and proportion of one single</h4><p><strong>action. And if in every particular action thou dost perform what is fitting to the utmost of thy power, let it suffice thee. And who can hinder thee, but that</strong> thou, the Lord of the Universe, will have thee to do it.</p> <p>Let's be direct with each other. It would be best if I describe the most recent action and its significance. So I've included a few references to various sex scenes in those short stories. However, just because I did the things that I write on my own, there is one other thing you should know. And if you haven't read a couple of my stories, you may want to know that I've been an ardent advocate of the genre of erotic storytelling. It's something that I've got plenty of success doing.</p> <p>There were a few reasons for the writers of my stories to be such brilliant. One, they were like a thousand different authors. I was lucky enough to have all the inspiration I need to make a better story than the last one I've written. Two, my stories are good enough to keep writers going, but they're not always in the same order. And three, it gets so boring when the first few things are really the only two things on the screen.</p> <p>One night when I first got my inspiration, I had a story posted on Literotica just before I had the most recent story posted. Unfortunately, it wasn't supposed to be posted, but that's another story for another time. However, it turned out to be the best story so far, and it could keep writers on their toes for a couple of hours. However, I'm willing to bet that it didn't make me the best inspiration there are after a certain chapter.</p> <p>I've written several fiction stories recently. I've been blessed with great authors who are always trying to make new ones. For that reason I do my best to write stories that are good for different kinds of people. So if you've read my writings, please try liking them if you're not interested in hearing about what they are and aren't good for you. I've written erotica and fiction about people I care deeply about. They're things that I write about.</p> <p>The story that I write about was originally meant to be about a human being being. Unfortunately, the story that inspired me is about a woman named Amy.</p> <p>I'm glad to hear feedback from everyone who sent an e-mail to me. I hope you enjoyed the story. I do have some other stories that I've been writing. I might add some other erotic story ideas to it as well.</p> <p>Thanks for reading.</p> <p>I've had some very exciting writing to share with you. Thank you for reading.</p> <p>Chapter 10 -- The Secret Love</p> <p>Amy had been dating David for a few weeks. It was summer, and it was a nice summer. The summer after she had left him. She had dated a few times before she left home. And she'd even dated him once before. That one occasion had been the first time we'd made the long distance lover-sharing session known as making love.</p> <p>In all her romance novels, Amy certainly had no romance. It was a romance, something that she always called it. It was fun for a while, but in the end it seemed like it would never work out.</p> <p>In the end, in the end we didn't make love. Not even once. We just had some fun loving each other. Sex for Amy wasn't the only time between our dates. It was fun. Amy and David made love every day when we first got together. She'd always had great sex once she got to know us. Of course we started doing more and more in bed. It was a lot.</p> <p>After a few years though, Amy had been tired of the idea of sex. She wanted to get back to my stories about having some fun and just have fun.</p> <p>So instead of writing her some more sex stories, while we were having our fun and loving each other, we were having them.</p> <p>Of course, in a romantic setting, I'd never written romantic romantic romances. I always thought it was boring. But, now that we were living a romance and I was beginning to read a book about a woman and her husband, we were having fun and loving each other.</p> <p>Amy knew all of that, but when I was reading her stories over and over, she seemed to not agree. She really did seem to have some idea on what we should have done.</p> <p>She eventually decided against it. When she did have an idea, however, though, it didn't seem like a bad idea. It was kind of nice. It had that certain sense that men had to have a strong sex drive. And it meant that we could have fun. It meant there would be a safe sex between us, and you, too. There would be nothing sexual, but just enjoying each other things that I could be.</p> <p></p> <p>--that was. I know. --.</p> <p>I-- And and other.
