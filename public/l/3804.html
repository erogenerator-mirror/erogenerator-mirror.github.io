As I neared the building I became more careful,</strong> knowing what would occur when I was about to knock on his door. There might be some resistance - perhaps an argument as I suspected, perhaps the word of an Amazon with her Amazon blood in her veins - but it would be as alluring as being naked with her woman like I felt. "Kan," the voice that answered me rang out. "Oh, do be gentle!" the man said. "Why don't you come in? There is some champagne there, as if you want to give me a little treat." Kan was in a deep shower in which only water emanated around me. The man, though, was a man. And there was a lot of him. Kan was a Roman warrior. His body was well muscled and taut. If I had been able to walk straight I would have taken his cock into my mouth with my face nestled in its softness and was already tasting his skin. But as it would be my first time with a man there I would prefer nothing to go near more than his sex. At once it would be all but impossible.</p> <p>Even if I had the right to touch as many guys's intimate parts as I desired and all the man's physical form would only be my way, we would be all the same. At the end a blowjob would be the least pleasurable, the best and the most intimate kind of oral sex. I just had to be sure I was a man so I could know it as well as I could act. And he needed that. But even after I had sucked him a little while longer than was strictly necessary, I still thought of my mission and decided to give him a blowjob of his own. I leaned over and kissed him, taking in his taste in my mouth. The man began to get impatient. "Be slow." he said, "and take your time. Please. But then you can have a lot of fun with me."</p> <p>"Oh, that's perfect!" I gasped, kissing my way down his chest and stomach while he reached for my breasts and tweaked my nipples. The man's cock was already hard and as I lowered his body to mine I found it to be a bit longer than the length of my man's and it was thicker. As we lay back on his bed I had a difficult time breathing. The man slid back on his back and pulled me towards him and before he could react I fell upon him with my legs, kissing him. He didn't fight at all and we kissed while he ran his fingers over my body. "It's not so far," I said when I felt he reached under me. He rubbed his cock on my pussy, which was throbbing from the anticipation of what might come. I pushed two fingers up into my pussy and felt it start to spasm; the man's fingers on my breasts, holding them, playing with my nipples. He began to kiss his way down my body, his lips gliding over my skin, nipping my skin.</p> <p>The man's tongue trailed down my stomach, leaving a trail of fire in its wake. He began to kiss me, then moved up my body to my tits, his lips and beard sucking one into his mouth and gently biting it. He sucked it softly. I had no experience with another man. I was usually the aggressor, but no man was my first. The man's tongue licked between my tits until they were all crinkled and pink. He sucked hard at each nipple. I lay back on the pillow, moaning and whimpering, not able to help but to look down to admire my work. I was surprised to see some of the men watching.</p> <p>The man's head was between my legs, licking me. The man's face looked very young, with his mouth pressed against my pussy. He was a little older than I was, maybe around thirty-five, and this man apparently wanted me to be the birthday girl. Even as I writhed in his mouth it thrilled me that I could make his life. The man was running his tongue over my asshole which, I had read in books, looked incredibly inviting. The man's fingers were pressing against my pussy now, rubbing it against my body. I wanted more. I wanted his cock. I felt I could have any cock at all.</p> <p>His fingers, while not as large as the others, were thicker and more skilled than the others. I felt a surge of heat as his fingertips worked me through the thin layer of my pussy lips. "Yes..." I moaned and suddenly I felt his tongue running up and down my slit. As his fingers probed I realized he intended to make me come without me. I was a virgin. I couldn't let go. I wanted the man's cock inside me right this second. To my legs parted to the man, toying for him both ways in a bit my legs. As he looked up at me. His hand moved over my breasts and slipped a finger between my legsâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
