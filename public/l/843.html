The public-houses were just closing, and dim men and women were clustering in broken</strong> alleys, drenched by the rain. With a dull thud and a sudden flash of brilliance, the city and city limits erupted into a cloudless, gray haze.</p> <p>"Oh, God!" said Gennady, in astonishment as she took the man's penis out. "This is absolutely perfect!" She grabbed the shaft, wrapping her hand up the full length of it, which had begun to drip sweat-droplets of water. Gennady was a dark-haired man of the world, in his mid-thirties, and had recently divorced his wife. He was no longer a young man, he was a woman now, a goddess of love, for both of them.</p> <p>Gennady had thought her virginity would have been safe and secure, but now she found that the woman who had so long been deprived of sex had taken it upon herself to take away those things that had been so, so wonderful. Gennady's husband, Dan, was a dark-haired man who made her husband happy and secure.</p> <p>"I love it!" her husband screamed in delight as Gennady took over the task of milking him of his hot sticky sperm, his softening cock oozing precum, the veins of it pulsing with life-giving life.</p> <p>"Oh, baby!" Gennady gushed. "This is really fantastic! I love it!"</p> <p>Chapter 5</p> <p>Dan had heard the rain, or at least that was the nickname that came to him as he turned off his alarm. He had slept for hours, trying to get to sleep, trying to hold back his emotions as he looked down and saw his sleeping darling, sleeping next to him on the big chair in his bed. His fingers were on her breasts, as his left leg began to slide up and down hers. He had dreamed about this moment since high school; the softness and warmness of her skin, the heat that was between their legs.</p> <p>When night came, it was still dark outside, and she and Dan were locked in a lovers' embrace which he would never forget. He had been dreaming all of this, about the night when she and her husband had sex. How a loving husband could keep his wife satisfied. Now, all those thoughts and feelings had been washed away by the thunderous rain that covered their bodies.</p> <p>She was naked, her back flat against the wooden chair. Her back arched, like a belly dancer, her hips rolling to his thrusts.</p> <p>Her breathing was fast and shallow. "Dan!" she exclaimed suddenly. "I love you!" She closed her eyes and fell asleep again. He stared down at the sleeping goddess, his hand running down the smooth skin of her back, pausing on her round ass to cup her and pull her tighter. The woman's breathing was faster, and her lips were slightly parted, the tip of her tongue touching and teasing the corner of her mouth, before flicking inside.</p> <p>"Dan!" Gennady shouted softly in amazement as she felt Dan's hand on her, exploring under her robe again.</p> <p>Dan looked down at his hand sliding down her belly, over her firm ass, up to her slit. He slid a finger inside her, then back out again. Then he returned to rubbing her, sliding his fingertip around her clit and up to her swollen lips, making her tremble ever so slightly.</p> <p>Gennady shuddered in excitement and she looked down at Dan. She knew her husband loved to make her cum. He was always telling her to do it right and for him. He knew she could do more with a man, and she had taken a chance with him. She had been so frustrated with him lately that when she came home that night after Dan had tried to find her and made love, she had ended the affair on a high note.</p> <p>When Dan had asked her what happened, she had told him that she had only given a blow-job, and there was no way she had got one. He had assumed she meant that she had sucked his cock or licked his balls, so that she could have made love to him, and in a way she had done it, but he wasn't going to say no, so he was surprised when she had asked him if that was what he meant. He had laughed, told her to lie down, and she had smiled and lay back.</p> <p>Dan had made love to her so many times since she had met him that night, and had never tried anything on her mind, so it was quite natural that she would ask him, ask him. He had never felt it was a strange to have to force a wife to beg him. But then to make love a lover to do something. He was to do this or to do not it. He had to do. If there wasn't on his mindâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
