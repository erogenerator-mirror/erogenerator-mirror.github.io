Nine Days</h4><p><strong>The marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the closed door of the Doctor’s room, where he was speaking with Charles Darnay. They were ready to go to</strong> bed when he returned, in an unbuttoned, dark blue tuxedo, to find a note on the table. They took the notes together, and walked up the steps into the suite. The reception desk had two desks on one wall, and a third open to the bed that the two husbands shared with their spouses. They stood at the head of the bed, watching the couples embrace each other from the side. With nothing in particular to be seen, the couple took turns kissing each other, in turn. After a long evening of passionate sex, and even more in the last ten days, they were ready to have the evening wrapped around their minds - and perhaps their own agenda. Charles laid her on the bed, and unbuttoned her blouse, freeing one of the most beautiful breasts that had ever adorned her body.</p> <p>With the help of a few drops of alcohol, they spent the next hour or so passionately kissing, tasting and feeling each other's curves in their imaginations. Charles lay back, on the bed beside his wife of three thousand years, with his right hand caressing her body. His cock pressed against her thigh, and she began to rub it up and down her slit, teasing it with the tips of her fingers. She felt a thrill of excitement that she had never imagined her own husband felt before.</p> <p>As her own hands continued exploring her body, she felt her own body begin to tingle and shudder with desire. She slid her hand down to the middle of her belly, and began to play with the hair below it as well. With one hand, she caressed and rubbed her clit, moving back through the lips of her pussy, from hole to clitoris, and back, feeling herself become engorged before her. When finally she felt the first shudders of an orgasm beginning, she had to take her hand away as well. She could feel a burning on her stomach that was almost indescribable. Her finger slipped easily from the slick wetness of her pussy when she felt Charles's left hand moving up her thigh. He pulled and caressed her clitoris into a hardening state, and made long, slow circles around her pink hole. She felt her hips begin to jerk when she felt his finger glide over her sphincter. His cock was hard and ready, begging to be taken. She heard the zipper on her shorts being undone as her hand was being slid under the bed sheets, caressed by the air of the room. She felt her nipples being tweaked, pinched, and pulled between his fingers. She felt himself pressed against her, his cock hard, pressing against the lips of her cunt. Her hips began to rotate slightly in his direction when all the while, his finger gently slipping inside of her. The excitement was unbearable, as each of his strokes increased in tempo. She felt a hot wave begin, as if her whole body was on the brink of explosion... the whole thing had taken too long. She started to breathe rapidly and moan loudly as her orgasm racked her body. With her legs locked tight against her crotch, she began to move in a slow rotation, almost like dancing. His face and hair was a mask of pleasure, as he felt her shuddering as if she would go on forever.</p> <p>After some time had passed between the three of them, when he began to move his finger back from her vagina, he whispered to her: "Do you feel the pressure coming on to your body?"</p> <p>She looked at her husband and said: "Yes. Yes, I'm about ready to go again. I really love being made love to."</p> <p>Charles grinned and gave her a kiss before putting her down on the bed to begin massaging her with his fingers. He was so aroused that he wanted to take his cock out and enter her right then and there, but his wife pushed him off, saying: "Honey, let me take care of that for you?" She quickly got onto her knees. He pulled her top off. He felt his head being tickled and sucked between her legs. "Oh, my God. I want your cock. Just take me." Her eyes were full of passion, her mouth and face flushed. She pulled her shorts off and lay back against her husband's stomach. He lay back, his head and shoulders resting on the bed. She pushed her skirt down while looking at him between her legs. "OK, honey, you can do just that. Fuck me."</p> <p>He smiled, knowing where her passion was directed. He loved her soft, feminine voice, her desire, her warmth, and how she said the words "fuck me", which made him want to do so. He began by kissing her thighs and the insides to make sure she was wet. He was already wet. In fact his fingers and wet from his wife had begun to run down to her feet. He used to make love her by finger her pussy. Then slowly. He pressed his fingers to press—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
