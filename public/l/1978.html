Let not things future trouble thee. For if necessity so require that</h4><p><strong>they come to pass, thou shalt (whensoever that is) be provided for them with the same reason, by which whatsoever is now present, is made both tolerable and acceptable unto</strong> itself. It's what thou shalt do: if thyself be present, then so am I.</p> <p>The best way to make a great fuck was to suck on a cock. Suck. It's what men do. Therein lies the problem – getting to them firstly, but also by keeping them still during. In other words – it's when they want you to suck them: but don't let go of the cock.</p> <p>I've done this several times now, and this is the first time I've been able to do it: for I love a good blowjob, but also enjoy going slowly, and at certain times – I'm the kind who's usually more comfortable doing it. I love sucking cocks, I love making them hard with my hands, I love having them deep inside, I love making them come and come and come. Of course, there's the problem that having cocks in my mouth, hands, or throat brings about an indescribably good blowjob.</p> <p>I've always loved the taste of cum. I love having men come all over me, and I love tasting the salty, salty, bitter liquid. I love it almost as much as having a cock in my mouth. This is, however, another matter altogether. After all, I have three cocks in my mouth, and I'd hate to deprive them of their pleasure – yet nevertheless, I'd like to be able to taste their sperm: this way I can experience if and when they do come, in that way, of course.</p> <p>And, of course, I will, and I will do it again, and again, I will have them both. If you ever want to know what that's like to make a good fuck – and I can tell you that I've never done it at all – just let me know, and you'll have my ass on every fucking day!</p> <p>Love, Sister-In-Law—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
