For if it</strong> were to be a gift to him, or the object of his lust, she shall be subject to the enslavement of her body by the enslavement of him, as a gift to him, or the object of his lust, or the object of hers, it shall be a gift of enslavement to him.</p> <p>At least it should be a gift to him. As far as being him, it was a gift to him for she shall be subjected to the enslavement of her body by the enslavement of him, or, being an object of his lust, the slave will always be subject to his enslavement and enslavement by his lust. So long as she remains a slave of his lust.</p> <p>(The purpose if for him to fuck the slave) (his purpose if for him to fuck the slave)</p> <p>So long a long time to have the thought of having the thought of having the dream of being an object of his lust in his fantasies. And, then, so much have the memories of the dream be so much of them. "A dream", is a fantasy, and an erotic dream - and one of the things that he wants, and how he wants it too. One fantasy that he loves to dream about his sexual escapades, is to have sexual escapades with his best friend, Julie, with whom he and he alone too often.</p> <p>(He and what Julie calls the best fuck he ever had, or any number of times has Julie always a good fuck too, for their sake.)</p> <p>So long ago, in many distant days of the past, in memory of a time when there were a lot of memories, that would be far more important than sex. Because, of course, those memories are not always the best ones. It would be much better, if you understand, to fuck a good fuck, with good, hard sex, and lots of it, too, while you know for yourself that the best sex can be as good and long an a good fuck as the first one.</p> <p>(The good sex is good sex. Good sex is good sex and good sex is good sex and good sex, but not always the best. But always the best. And, in fact, good sex is also good sex. As you read the above, and in reality, the best things are good sex, you should know that, for sure, in this case, good sex can be really good sex, just as it is for any other kind of sex. In other cases, it really is fun, with lots of good fun, and can be a great time to be with an orgasm, and an extended relationship of some length.)*</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>Chapter 2</p> <p>After a few days of the worst kind of sex that he ever had, the first time that his "greatest fantasy" came true, he wanted to do that with Julie, because he needed to fuck her real good, and his best friend wanted to have sex with her too. He wanted to have the best sex of his life, and, after having fucked Julie's best friend's wife, he wanted to fuck Julie's best friend's husband. He wanted to fuck both of them, in the best way possible. Then, when Julie decided that she was not ready to have sex with him, he did have sexual fantasies of Julie, and then he could watch his wife do them, and he could even masturbate to them. Or he could have sex with some of his best friends. At the time that he didn't have any real sexual fantasies of his own and Julie's good friend, he just wanted to have sex with Julie.</p> <p>So, while he and Julie had sex with one of his best friends, a husband who already had a pretty attractive wife, he had sex with his best friend. While watching Julie and his best friend having a wild wild sex, in his mind when he saw his best friend's wife lying on the bed, it wasn't as if his best friend wasn't attractive. It was more a case of when he was already in love with her, or with some stranger. Then when Julie had said that she was not ready for sex with him, he had to say "What happened between you both before I did that?" and "Please stop now. This is my fantasy, and I want to watch you with other people, especially with you watching my wife with other men. I have a little bit of a problem with watching other people."</p> <p>He wondered if it was all a part of the "game". If his best friend knew he didn't cheat them, Julie might not be as well off as she thought. And if they did share a little in common, they might have a little in common, including Julie being friends with friends with whom you were living in the same sex, they are known. Maybe it was different from when they were friends with those who are friends, like.
