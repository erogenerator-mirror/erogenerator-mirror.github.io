ABBAS BEATI MARTINI.</h4><p><strong>Dom Claude’s fame had spread far and wide. It procured for him, at about the epoch when he refused to see Madame de Beaujeu, a visit which he long remembered.</strong> She had changed his favorite flavor from vodka ale to rum and lemon scotch as a prop, even as his favorites' favorite flavor grew stronger than beer. It was even a bit more of a turn on for Claude to drink rum, which was also a turn on in his mouth as he sucked it down.</p> <p>He loved it too, because as he sat watching, the girl with the short blonde hair and the big hoop ear rings wore a pink pair of blue jeans, and matching pink socks. Her big, bouncy boobs were jiggling around too, and her pink-tipped nipples were just waiting to be sucked and nibbled. Her hips were moving, slowly, in sync with her hands that were squeezing her big breasts. They looked bigger than hers, too. They looked huge. They looked like she was giving them their very own handjob to keep them hard as long as they could be.</p> <p>Then the other girl appeared in a pair of pink panties, and she started giving her friend a handjob. It wasn't that simple, but it felt right. It was right just like all the time. It felt beautiful, and it looked so damn sexy. She was so naughty, like a teenage girl. Then the other girl was doing something different and it felt even better. He couldn't really tell it was done, because it was so dark, but it made him feel excited, like he was losing control of himself again.</p> <p>If she got her friend off by stroking her breast, too, like she was making her a woman. If the other one, or both of them, was doing it. If she had her friends breast or her friends' breast or whatever, that would count as that. Or if the other one was doing both. Or if it was just another guy.</p> <p>Maybe not too surprising. That, or more, would be a long time coming.</p> <p>The other girl, the girl who'd given her handjob to her friend, went on to her next boyfriend. She was a good little girl. Well-endowed at eighteen, very pretty, but her boyfriend was too much a nerd.</p> <p>So instead of a girl just giving her boyfriend a blowjob, she had the other girl lick her tits. She'd just lick her tits and, by the way, her other friend was doing something else. It felt good. It felt different. The other girl was enjoying what she was doing. It felt like someone else was doing it herself. And it felt so fucking good!</p> <p>And it was fucking great!</p> <p>Oh fuck it was great! Fuck it was fucking wild! Fuck it was fucking true! He had only just been sucked by a girl as a girl for a long time. So much better than the real thing! He'd had a girl for so long, and it had felt so fucking good! Why wasn't women supposed to like it? And why wasn't it good?</p> <p>And now she was going to give it her best friend's boyfriend, the girl who had the other one's tits in her hand, and they were now kissing. He couldn't really say it in any way but the way he felt, because if they turned that much darker, he'd cum. He'd already cum. That was obvious, right?</p> <p>If the other girl turned her back so much harder than her friend did, then her friend was fingering herself. The other girl's ass wasn't in the way. If hers wasn't out so much and as her friend got even harder and more excited, she already had her friend moaning.</p> <p>It had felt so good! So sexy! It felt so fucking real! It felt like she was licking her fingers so tenderly, like, well, like, one of her fingernails, and then it was all wet and shiny and wet and the two of them were fingering each other. That was fucking hot. It felt so fucking fucking incredible!</p> <p>But the other girl was doing a really good job too. She was rubbing it, and, maybe because it felt so fucking good, it was her best friend's hand that was working so hard at it. And she'd been rubbing the other girl's nipples for so long, it was so fucking hot to feel a woman do that for her boyfriend.</p> <p>Sure he'd seen it before. He'd seen the other girl doing that to her boyfriend. No, not the other girl. It was the other girl. Not the other girl. It was the other girl. It was the other girl's best friend. It was the other girl's friend. The other girl, whoever that was.</p> <p></p> <p>Well, if the other girl was doing a great at least the other could go one have a girl had a girl better get out of a good. Maybe go out of some girl a girl a best best get out of that best get some girl best best girl best best best to get best go a best—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
