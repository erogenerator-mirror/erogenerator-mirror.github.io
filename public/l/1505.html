If there were hope of catching the thief before another sunrise, Grandfather wouldn’t</strong> be able to resist. The sound of the door closing announced they had done as they were commanded and moved on. And with that Granddad turned and left the room.</p> <p>***</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Chapter Three</p> <p>"How many of the boys are there?" I asked myself. "There is so much here already." I looked around the huge room. There were twelve different pieces of furniture. There were the two video booths and the long table that served as a bed and a TV. There was the table with four pillows, a small flat screen TV sitting there, and a bed. My room looked the same as always.</p> <p>"There is more, but I don’t know quite what they will do.” I said to the guy lying in the middle of the massive bed.</p> <p>“Hey Jim, wanna see some fun?” Jim said as he held my head tight as a caged baby. As long as he had his cock buried deep inside me he could do whatever he wanted with those luscious titties of his. After taking hold of one big and heavy tit Jim pushed the other one under each arm and squeezed my left tit.</p> <p>“Fuck Jim, that’s enough. Take your fucking cocks away!” I said loudly, pushing Jim away. I dropped to my knees and undid his belt and unzipped his pants and pulled his pants down and off. I looked over to where my friend Jim lay sleeping. As she was lying there with her hand wrapped around that cock Jim stood over her, his cock waving from his body as he took control of the night. Jim’s cock was bigger than normal, maybe even bigger than my husband Michael and the others I had taken. I had already been tempted but never really acted on it. Still Jim had me fooled with his cock.</p> <p>I quickly moved to the edge of the bed and pushed Jim down on his back and slid my hands all along his body. My arms had little range of motion as I held onto his neck and shoulders and I slowly slid my naked body down his torso, across his chest, and down the length of his cock until it was nestled against the top of my thigh. My pussy was still sore from my own earlier orgasms and Jim’s cum oozed from my pussy and dripped down and into his pubic hair. Jim’s cock was bigger than Michael’s but still soft and it didn’t seem to come anywhere near my pussy. Then I let go and it swung back and forth, side to side, as if it would take up and down the entire length my naked body.</p> <p>Jim was laying on his back and I began licking the head of his cock while I slid my tongue down the side of it and across the base of his shaft to take his balls in my mouth. Jim moaned loudly as I slid my tongue down his shaft to his balls, as he pulled his legs up and over my shoulders as if I were a baby. His cock was now about eight inches long and as hard as it had ever been.</p> <p>I was in my own world of thoughts as I continued to slide my mouth up Jim’s cock. I imagined I had just been pleasured and loved it by Jim just for himself and Michael because I was doing it to myself while watching a film of me licking his cock. As Jim and I had agreed to keep my eyes closed during our foreplay I had forgotten about my own body until my hand had slipped between my legs and a finger had easily slipped inside the folds of my pussy. As I had heard the word “nasty” when I had first heard it in the porn channel I had stopped short of using a word that had ever seemed to suggest I should keep that away. Maybe that was a bit of a joke!</p> <p>The sound of Jim’s breathing suddenly stopped and Jim’s body went stiff. As Jim pulled me closer to him with both hands he cried out quietly and moaned as his cock swelled and spurted out the first jet of his cum. My mouth filled with jizz as he cried out and I greedily swallowed every drop of his cum. Jim’s cock was still hard as he lifted my head up and kissed me while his hands explored my body. We quickly got dressed and Jim helped my friend lay down in the bed and then got into bed with me, slipping his cock back inside me while he held my head against his chest.</p> <p>My body had been turned on since Jim had made love to me before and I found it hard to keep my eyes open or from falling asleep. The feeling of Jim’s of his weight on my body and as his cock sliding in and my pussy and caused me to drift back and the same as Jim filled my mouth and as his cock slipped up the bed and feeling of Jim” lying between my legs—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
