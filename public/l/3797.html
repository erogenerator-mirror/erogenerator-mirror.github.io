We were twenty days upon the road, crossing two sea bottoms and passing through or around a number of ruined cities,</strong> making a total of two and a half days of freedom, before the dawn of the First Republic of the Starry-Sea. We had been traveling alone for almost two months.</p> <p>Two days were not all we had to take, though it seemed like a long eternity at the time. A long journey and some very dangerous driving. The only thing on our minds at the moment was to complete our search and to return to the base where we would once be alone.</p> <p>I am a human. I am not a race to be ruled by my heart, my brain or my thoughts. I am a creature who has been used for some very special purposes. The only person who had been sexually active during my short travel was myself. You see, when I'm not a passenger, I'm still a person. And this is where I was going.</p> <p>We had traveled in complete darkness for two very long periods of time, traveling at night as though there were no walls separating us. And even now I can still swear it. I was going to come. I was going to come in my pants, I was going to fuck someone, whether it'd be anyone else or whoever I might fancy. No such luck.</p> <p>But that's not the only reason for my lustful thoughts. A whole lot more.</p> <p>My lips curled into a devilish grin. I was going to fuck her. Her legs came up on either side of mine, wrapping them around my waist, while her tongue went to work on mine. My hands were wrapped around her waist, one on top of the other, while her feet kept our momentum steady. As I did so, I thought I pulled my lips from hers to see if there would be any trace of our tongues. In the meantime, I'd been looking at the sky and noticed that we were going into some kind of city called Svalbard. Where the sun was setting, our destination was on the north of the ocean. And from the looks of the stars, it looked like we'd be here for quite awhile.</p> <p>My thoughts were interrupted by her kiss. Her tongue slithered inside my mouth and began battling with mine. And just like that, our tongues wrapped around each other and danced in a battle we did not know we were going to win. It was an unbelievable experience to be with someone like this, and I was beginning to find that if I'd let her come, it would be the best thing that had ever happened to me.</p> <p>Our kiss continued, then our clothes were removed. And as our kissing, I removed her shirt, dropping to my knees, I slid my hands down to her pants, then reached under her to feel her, squeezing her ass and squeezing it lightly.</p> <p>And that's when I noticed something else, I didn't notice at the time. A rather impressive bulge was straining, as it had the moment we first entered the sea. A man could do an enormous job in the sexual domain of an ocean. Not as big as the size of most men's hands, but a good long one nonetheless.</p> <p>And just as I could now feel the heat coming from his chest, it also became apparent that this was his main reason for going down, and the man himself hadn't done a very good job on that.</p> <p>A second thought came rushing back into view, then it was too late.</p> <p>My pants were off in an instant, while his hands began sliding, sliding, slowly up and down my shaft. His head found the slit as he touched the end, and his mouth opened as he took the head of my cock in, and his tongue flicked out quickly to make sure it slid under the slit as well.</p> <p>He began sliding the crown through the opening of his mouth, then his tongue shot out again, and I thought that it made sense. Maybe that was exactly the idea. But just at the same time, the desire to fuck the man in front of me grew more fierce. I knew what it was exactly.</p> <p>Suddenly, he stopped his movements. His mouth opened, then closed and a few moments later my dick had its first taste of flesh, my shaft. And I felt it, the sensation of it, the smell of the man, the taste. I mean, fuck, my dick was hard, but I still found it very sexy. I'd been holding it, my hand around the base, never letting go of it, ever since it began to grow. It didn't take long before it was hard again.</p> <p>The rest of the time that we had were nothing. The taste of food was all over us. People we barely knew in the islands of Nambhav, who only knew me by name. Our kisses were not the most passionate, just the gentlest formulation of things. It was a place where the rest of our minds and our thoughts and our hearts were. And that each other bodies and the mind lay in which could be partâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
