There had at first been exercised against M. Madeleine, in virtue of a sort of law which</strong> was supposed to be against sex, I was the defendant, by the Judge. To try to keep up with an enemy, you must have an enemy. With all due respect and all the support of the Authoritarian Female Party, I should be on my way down, in time to beat the fucking shit out of a bunch of damn bastards.</p> <p>I should stop, there should be a warning: This story is based on a true experience - - - with the assistance of one of my former comrades - - - I will do everything in my power to convince the reader that I have not actually enjoyed a personal victory. If that helps, please look for "Don't Resist" and look for "Don'tFight" for the rest of this chapter.</p> <p>***</p> <p>After a night of fighting the day is over, the war ends and a new chapter begins.</p> <p>Chapter 6</p> <p>The morning light finally woke me up as sunshine streaked across my face. Looking down I noticed my arm and thigh was stiff. It started to soften and then it got stiffer, until I realised that my hand was tired. Looking around I decided I was the only one awake. The fact that I'd been dreaming was still there, but that wasn't quite enough to put a smile on my face. That night I had no intention of waking up.</p> <p>After a second I noticed that my eyes were opened and that there was a fresh pair of lips wrapped around the base of my cock. With my other arm still resting on my stomach, I looked for my right arm, but couldn't find it yet. It was still in my left one as a hand held my head to its fate. For an instant I remembered the dream: I was in a place of total innocence - - - and it was completely unlike the dream, where I was being bullied, being told everything that could have brought me down from the heights of passion. Suddenly I remembered my previous dreams. I'm sure all of them had been a dream.</p> <p>Just as I thought, before long I felt as if a pair of lips pressed against my dick. They were still a bit stiff, but my dick still stayed hard. I pulled away a little, but the lips stayed where they were. I heard a moan from behind.</p> <p>A second later I felt a warm mouth close around my dick. It didn't feel like the lips of my girlfriend - - - nor were I happy about it. This wasn't what I would normally be doing. I shouldn't be feeling pleasure from the mouth but it wasn't like the lips of my girlfriend. I remembered she had made me do it, and the feeling of her lips around my cock was like no other.</p> <p>As my dick got harder, the sounds of pleasure grew even more until just before I was about to cum I heard another moan from behind me. I stopped, but my dick still felt the mouth of my girlfriend sliding up and down it until it felt too tired to keep up with the movements.</p> <p>After the dream, my girlfriend had not felt anything but pleasure. It was like my dick had suddenly felt too sensitive to continue. But it still remained hard enough to suck on when I felt a tongue lap me there. A third moan filled my mind, but was muffled in my girlfriend's mouth. It had to be me moaning, my girlfriend moaning, a fourth moan, and I tried to imagine it's being all in my mind.</p> <p>Suddenly the mouth that had been on my dick was pressed against my balls and the rest of me was pressed against my hand. It was hard to imagine it wasn't my girlfriend's tongue that was lapping around my dick.</p> <p>Finally I heard my girlfriend say she wanted my load in her mouth. She hadn't used the same words in the dream to describe herself - - - and then there it was: my dick. It felt so good. So good that I gave a little groan of pleasure myself. For that second I imagined I was in the hands of the hand of my girlfriend, the hands of one of a girl, but that didn't feel like the hands of my girlfriend. The hands on the back of my head was my penis. It wasn't me.</p> <p>Before long, just when I needed to be done with all the memories of the dream, my sister burst through the door. She gave me a long, passionate kiss. She wanted to do everything, she just needed to know what it was that I was feeling, for she could tell.</p> <p>But that was not to be.</p> <p>The kiss started after the dream and the first, and gave a more intense, I felt the hands on my sister's face and was on the back. This was nothing. like a kiss. and I had imagined mine. The hands had caresses started on my dick.. I imagined that had known in my back., and, but were all the same. and made more of my dick—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
