She sighed for the air, the liberty, the</strong> freedom, the freedom.</p> <p>And the first thing she felt was the head of her cock. Marianne pulled her cock out of her panties and wrapped her hand around it, which already felt rather slippery and sensitive - much more than she used to. Marianne moved the hand to the side of the shaft before guiding it into herself. After a minute or two Marianne stopped. As she moved inside herself, her voice was shaky and breathless.</p> <p>"No!" she said, exasperated. "This won't..." But Marianne's hand was still around her cock. They were both breathing heavily.</p> <p>"Oh yeah?" Marianne asked, and stroked her fingers over the other side of her body. Her panties were still in her hands and she put them back on.</p> <p>"No, it's not..." she began but was cut off by the head of her cock entering her.</p> <p>Marianne pushed inside of herself, and in that second she felt like she might die. Every inch she felt was different- the flesh around her dick - the texture of herself - but overall it felt like it was a wonderful thing to feel like she was fucking herself. She felt her climax rising as she felt that, and Marianne continued to stroke her cock as she came on her own cock.</p> <p>Marianne's eyes opened. She was surprised that she could stay in time after the experience and let herself experience it again. She tried not to think about the fact that she was still naked but that she had no idea where the room went, nor had she felt comfortable enough to ask the receptionist to get her clothing back - and she could not bring herself to ask someone to handwash her - even if she had seen Marianne's dick.</p> <p>"What? There's something wrong with the way I'm feeling...?" she said to no one in particular.</p> <p>"I just feel... I feel like I'm having a... an..." But she was lost for words. Her orgasm had faded away and only the very feeling of Marianne's hand around her cock still sent a shiver through her.</p> <p>"I don't like the feeling of you so completely," Marianne said eventually. "I don't like being naked outside and not having anything to hold on to. You look so hot."</p> <p>"What?" Marianne asked.</p> <p>"And I just like you in this."</p> <p>"What!" Marianne cried out, surprised, and it brought tears to her eyes. "You're right. It's just not... I..." She let go of her cock and it came to her. "It's..."</p> <p>"It's what?" Marianne repeated. She looked at it and realized it was, indeed, quite beautiful. "This does feel...?"</p> <p>"It feels good," Marianne said, her head hanging down. "Yes, it does feel good. The way you're holding it... it feels so good."</p> <p>"You don't like this?" Marianne asked, but her voice was soft. She turned to face her dresser and began organizing piles of what could have been pictures of her topless and nude as well—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
