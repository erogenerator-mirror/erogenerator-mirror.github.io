We all work to one effect, some willingly, and with a rational</h4><p><strong>apprehension of what we do: others without any such knowledge. As I think Heraclitus in a place speaketh of them that sleep, that even they do work in their kind,</strong> they always have. When you sleep with one, you have a certain familiarity and the ability to make others feel the same?</p> <p>She said she's going there, I wanted to.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>I wanted to do this. I dreamed. And here it is, a dream; a fantasy. The world is spinning. A dream of being so, a dream of sex? I want to. I wanted to do this. I'm going to do it. This dream made of a little flesh. But that is only a dream. I can feel it too, that your body is the light of my imagination.</p> <p>Her eyes are focused on me.</p> <p>Yes. My cock slides in her body. Her pussy stretches out to my cock as I enter her. God it's just as good as it's made out to be. As wet as it is, the softness of her pussy caresses my cock like it was made to be fondled. Just a little, gentle. She is warm, soft and I know she is as excited as I am. I pull her into me. She is the most gorgeous, responsive and sensuous pussy I've ever fucked. I can feel her as soon as I enter her. She is ready for me and as I enter her, she is even wetter than usual, and she is ready for more. I pound her.</p> <p>Her hand leaves my ass. I am moving in her.</p> <p>Her skin touches my cock as it slides in and out of her. I have been able to do this for hours, but have no idea what it is like. My cock is moving in and out of her. Her breath is coming, little gasps and moans. I kiss her cheek and stroke her head to show her her body. I can't stop my heart and my cock from racing and my mind from racing. She is beautiful, and she knows my desires. She knows what drives me. She has her own style of making love, but the way she kisses and feels my body in her touch and in her kisses. Like the way she plays her fingers on my body. She makes me feel loved and cared for and so many other things. She has the world to herself.</p> <p>My mind wants to turn, I want to turn into Her.</p> <p>I am trying to slow my pace, but I can't. My cock begins to spasm.</p> <p>You are there. She feels it. A soft, soft cry escapes her throat. "Please," I whisper to her. "More." And I take her, all of She.</p> <p>It all begins. And my cock does. I feel Her orgasm wash over me. I do not stop until I too am filled with my cum. I shoot into Her. Her pussy tightens and releases, milks my cock with each squeeze.</p> <p>We are a moment of sheer, sheer happiness. We are all one and we have each other, and we know each other's joy in bed. I am here now, with Her.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Her body has been hard and wet on my cock, and I think she enjoyed it. Her body is so soft and warm. So inviting.</p> <p>Her pussy lips surround my cock, and I slide inside her. Like it is made of a little flesh. Her warmth envelopes my cock and we both enjoy it.</p> <p>We both want it more than I can think of. Like this.</p> <p>Yes. I just fucked Her pussy. Her pussy wants it more than I can make love to it! I'm fucking Her. I'm fucking Your pussy! Your pussy is making love to my cock. Her mouth is kissing my lips. Our tongues interlock. Her hand is on my neck, pulling at my shoulder. I can feel all of Her. So tight. Her arms are around my waist. We are bodies, kissing. Kissing and fucking. I want to feel You. I want to feel You. I want so much to have You in me and feel like this.</p> <p>Her body moves against mine. Her head is on my shoulder and her arms are around me.</p> <p>There is no way to deny the feeling that I have. I am fucking You with all of my body. Her body is in contact with mine and us both enjoy it. I want to feel You. I want to feel You around me. I want to take Her, to own this pleasure and our pleasure. I want to own her pleasure. I want to feel her. I want to know your bodies. I want to know my lovers, know how to pleasure you and make you feel as though the experience could never end. I want to tell You all your heart, hear Your heart in your body, hear your mind as the pleasure, experience and know You pleasure through our own every inch. That you as you. I fuck and know you. I loveâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
