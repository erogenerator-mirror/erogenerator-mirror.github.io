Neverthelesse one may very reasonably</strong> assume, that a Law cannot be violated through a word or actions. But even if that is not, perhaps we could be mistaken in assuming a word or action. If not, though, one is able to determine, by how the words or actions are performed in order to convey their meaning, that would be true for the book of Laws and not just for any word or action that is committed.</p> <p>I found the position of the female on top of me to be both comfortable and uncomfortable, but also pleasing as it was for me. I also found it to be somewhat of an erotic delight to lay back and enjoy for quite a while. Then, one of the things I found pleasurable was to have a female body on my hips and a female rear up in front of me.</p> <p>My experience with the female's body was not one of being made ready to fuck, but rather a woman's satisfaction as she pleasurably received the pleasure and pleasure of being fucked by a male. And I also enjoyed what she accomplished by pleasuring two male members of the same sex. In addition to the enjoyment of a female partner I also enjoyed having her be fucked by them. I am sure I heard about the pleasures that a human female gives as a child by taking a male's cock into her anus. Sometimes I heard them say "A woman's mouth on his cock," but it was never a question. Nor was that done in the act of intercourse as it had been in the act of any sexual intercourse.</p> <p>But as a female of the species I found the best way to enjoy having two male bodies involved at the same time was to have both, by mutual sucking and by the mutual stimulation of both men in the same way.</p> <p>After I had fucked a woman several times, I could not resist a little licking her pussy. Then I could take a long, drawn-out moment of pleasure with licking and kissing her vulva. And once that climax happened, all my pleasure and pleasure and pleasure were satisfied by it as a part of the act.</p> <p>And a special thing here. I have always had a theory, at times. That some men and some women must have been physically intimate with each other after having sex with others, that is, that this act of lovemaking must occur at the point of mutual sex. I have known this notion for some time. But after a while, the idea had become very commonplace and as usual was the result.</p> <p>Then one day, when I was alone with a male friend of mine, it happened. He had been telling me something about the great sexual pleasure he had received, by the way, of having two women being made love to at the same time by a female's mouth on their genitals. So it was that I asked if he was lying about making love with men and to whom he said he had had sex with his own, too.</p> <p>For I have already said that all men like to see or taste women's sex. That's what they think I mean, as well as to know it from the very beginning. It would be an advantage if you can learn the technique to a woman's satisfaction and that is what you're going to see. For sure, if two women had a male member of the opposite sex between them she might be able to do it. But if the two can do it that way too, in this way you can actually begin to enjoy the pleasure of the two. For me, that is.</p> <p>You can learn how to enjoy a woman's pleasure by licking her. I mean, lick her vagina, then bring it in with your fingers from the side. Lick her clit.</p> <p>As for sucking her clitoris, there is nothing wrong in that; it's just a little part of the act. The other side of pleasure comes from the fact that there is the pleasure of a clitoris being sucked on or licked that is also part of another. Lick her, then take your fingers and gently slide them inside her vagina. Use your tongue just as you feel her clitoris against your lip. Try to lick it as the way it feels, but if she can feel your tongue flicking on it, feel what it must feel. Use the fingers on one hand to press and stroke the two sides of her clitoris.</p> <p>Lick her, first with a long, deep stroke, then with a slow and circular motion. She likes that. Make her writhe while you lick her.</p> <p>If you lick her clitoris like you're licking my anus, do it gently and slowly. If you stick your tongue far inside a vagina, feel it move around inside, making it almost as a sensation, then you can feel it move around inside, too. It's your job.</p> <p></p> <p>Now you can do the same with the penis with the vagina. L, feeling the vagina: press it, put it and penetrate it in or with your fingersâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
