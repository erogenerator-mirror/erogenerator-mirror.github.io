The Gilder.</h4><p><strong>Penetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising ground, the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery. Often, in mild, pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen,</strong> and twenty four hours a day, they were known to be able to have excellent sex.</p> <p>"I guess it would take a lot more than two hours of sleep and an hour of food to make all twelve get horny girls.</p> <p>"Mmm," she moaned excitedly. "A lot of it." She rolled over, and lay there, watching her manhood slowly retreat into her body.</p> <p>"Hey, are you sure about this?" I asked.</p> <p>She gave me a devilish grin.</p> <p>"Honey, if you want to fuck more than two hours with a long, hot wet cock, and an even longer, thick, meaty prick," she told me, leaning over to kiss me.</p> <p>I reached for her breasts, squeezing the luscious mounds as she sat up and kissed me again. The two of them slowly stroked each other's cocks, watching and doing their best to please the others, while they slowly worked their way into my horny wife's body.</p> <p>We kissed for a good while, until she began to writhe again, almost violently. I was amazed for just a second at how much sex I was ever getting. My sexy, young wife was in the midst of getting royally fucked by two of the most popular women in town at the time.</p> <p>We made out for a moment, until I was hard again. Then she lifted herself off her feet and straddled my waist with her back to me. As she began to stroke my prick, she put her hands behind her, on my chest, to steady herself. Then she was riding me, and I was doing the same to her, both of us working her body up to a frenzy.</p> <p>"You feel good, honey."</p> <p>"Honey, you have no idea how good it feels to you."</p> <p>"I have a thing for that shit and I'm going to make sure you know it, too."</p> <p>We kissed again, for a while, and then she began to ride me really hard, fucking my cock so good, I felt I would lose myself in the joy of it. I didn't care that I was nearly a full-time, one-night stand. I couldn't even tell you who she was. She fucked me so hard, and for so long and for so long, I could barely focus on what the fuck was going on. I just watched as my horny wife got to fucking the man she was supposed to be banging on her bed. A good man would have thought his wife would be making out with the man he was supposed to be sleeping with on their honeymoon. Not one of her men had ever fucked her. Not many men were, either.</p> <p>For a while she just kept fucking me like that, and we were both getting pretty turned on by it.</p> <p>"Honey, I'm gonna come soon," I moaned.</p> <p>"Mmmm, I'd like that."</p> <p>"It's a condom," she said, looking down at me.</p> <p>She kept on fucking and riding, going for so long she couldn't stop. I felt as if I was going to burst.</p> <p>"You want to put a condom on, honey?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Do you want to come inside me?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Will you fuck me inside the condom?"</p> <p>"Yes, baby." She kissed me as she kept her tempo going.</p> <p>"I don't know. But I'm not a virgin anymore. Just wait until we're done, okay?"</p> <p>I couldn't say "Yes" with a condom. That night was one of the best. I had come inside her a long time ago, and I still had a good time. It didn't matter that I hadn't had all that sex in years. The sex was wonderful. Maybe it had something to do with the condoms.</p> <p>It was two in the morning when we heard the alarm go off in the bedroom. She got up and slipped on her panties, while I dressed hurriedly and opened the door.</p> <p>"What is it? Do we have to go to work tomorrow? I need to shower."</p> <p>"We got the whole fucking day to ourselves," I said. "I'll drive, and when you get back, you can pick up the keys in the garage."</p> <p>"No, you don't want to get dressed and go to work, okay?"</p> <p>"Honey, it's not my choice. I need to go, okay?"</p> <p>"Okay. And I'm sorry. And I'll make-m-bye and I'll-bye for now." -bye."</p> <p>, and she gave me a big-bye and to-bye, and I. I could go. "See and you and not and you-go." , I'm you love and notâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
