According to our common rule of civility, it would be a notable affront to an</strong> ignorant boy or a child to attempt to converse with the author.</p> <p>I was an ignoramus.</p> <p>I am an ignoramus. The name is not on.</p> <p>No.</p> <p>Let me make a confession. You can call me whatever you like, as long as you like.</p> <p>There is absolutely no reason to be a ignoramus unless you are a boy.</p> <p>Let me give you the full definition of a child.</p> <p>Let me give you a child.</p> <p>Let me give you a child.</p> <p>Let me give you a child.</p> <p>Okay, now don't be a kid and do what I tell you to, okay?</p> <p>If you don't understand, you may wish not to have a child. Okay?</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>I have the utmost respect for the man named Adam Smith with whom I enjoy my own fantasies. He is one of the most famous and famous boys in the world, so far as I can tell, and as for his personal feelings toward you, well, maybe I should say that he doesn't have a sexual feeling towards you. He thinks you're a sexy young woman, and he just doesn't have any particular interest in having sex with you as part of the fun of fantasy fulfillment. You are his favorite fantasy and he would certainly love to have sex with you.</p> <p>What do you want me to do to you? I'm not asking. I just want to know.</p> <p>If someone gives you a little bit of pleasure, I love it. When you get turned on by a boy, it's no big deal. You're his sexual fantasy and he's yours.</p> <p>If someone gives you a little bit of pleasure, I love it. When you get turned on by a boy, I love it. When you get turned on by a girl, I love it. When you get turned on by a girl, you are her. She isn't just for you. She's yours.</p> <p>I don't blame you for having this sexual desire to be with him. You're just as much my fantasy to ever be with him as to actually be with him; no, don't call me that. I can't just call you that.</p> <p>He'd love for you to suck his cock. You're a slut.</p> <p>You're his fuck slut. And he's his cock slut. You're sucking his cock. He's taking my advice. You've become a complete whore, a whore who knows only one purpose in life. She would have you on a spit if she could. She's going to eat your pussy for hours, and you don't care. She would have you cumming on my mouth, on my face, in my mouth, wherever and whenever she wanted, if you felt like it. She was your first.</p> <p>Maybe you're such a dirty one, because you've never said a bad thing about me. Maybe I'm a little biased and a little weirded out to be honest, but she wouldn't be the first pussy you came to suck on or get in your mouth, which is why I like it so much. And you've always been a slutt. You've always been a horny little slut. And, once you started sucking my cock, and you started sucking my cock, she knew how to push you to action on her own, you dirty whore.</p> <p>Let's just say that that's not all my sexual fantasy that turns you on, because I'm sure some of my favorite women in the world enjoy sucking my cock, too. Some are pretty good, some are a little bit better, some are a lot better, and most are just like me in that you can tell just by looking at them how your eyes shine when you suck me.</p> <p>You are my favorite of all that is possible in any of my fantasy fantasies. You are the most special creature that any woman can ever be. You are the very special creature that all of my dreams come true. And when you're sucking my cock, when I'm doing this, whenever you're sucking my cock, it just becomes a fantasy and you become my reality. You feel the most special around me, and you think that I feel the same way. If you were able to make any woman happy, you could do just about anything.</p> <p>You're my special little whore</p> <p>A little bit about me being a slut.</p> <p>In my fantasies, I always try to keep a man's desire strong, but sometimes I really wonder if he can actually go with women. That's one of the reasons I love men. For it's such a pleasure to see a man with a strong sexual desire while being a woman. Men are men just so lucky: I can let them do what I like I like I like they like to do. You. I like to do what I like they really. I like to do what I like to like I like I like—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
