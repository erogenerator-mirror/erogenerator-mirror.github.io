There is no good excuse in confessing to anyone else that that is sin. Thus, sin is the whole truth. But let's take the sacrament of God together.</p> <p>The holy truth is that confession is the sign of a confession of guilt.</p> <p>There are two ways to confess sins.</p> <p>There is a good and a bad confession.</p> <p>The sin that has been confessed for God is so deeply sinful that it has to be taken as being the Holy of Holies. That can be counted as holy confession.</p> <p>There again is that the holy truth that is sin. Just a few, and nothing more.</p> <p>For people who have a reason for confessing sins, it has to be the most difficult confession of all.</p> <p>There is a big problem with confession. What people say goes back to their past. What people say isn't the most important thing, but there is a good thing in confessing sins that you should remember.</p> <p>What should be done, and why do we need to know about this? If it were me in the church, or you, I just wouldn't be so sure. What are you waiting for? You've confessed your own sins. Why, after all this time, when you still look so sexy and beautiful, why do you still feel as though you've been unfaithful to God.</p> <p>Why does it take a lifetime for God to forgive this sin from your past, then forgive it from you? Why can't a sin only be forgiven from another sin, when there is no sin? You can't forgive an innocent by being the most innocent sin. How can you possibly forgive an innocent by being unfaithful to your own self?</p> <p>I don't really know, but in my mind I do know that confessing sins in front of God is really difficult for me. I can't believe that this all comes down to your need to have the truth. What it's like to know that you are not guilty just is. It's not sin, is it? This sin is really only that one sin? Well, if that's the end of it, then it's all a matter of keeping my mind and soul from going into an endless loop. I think, that's it. You're a believer.</p> <p>How can I not? We all have a story to live withâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
