The kitchen was spick and</strong> span and that was what her new lover used to do every evening. He didn’t need to ask permission and she didn’t object. For the remainder of the day, her boyfriends helped out; they did the dishes and helped each other’s clothes, but they didn’t do much of anything else.</p> <p>When he had finished washing up, she made him an extra pitcher of orange juice, took his hand and guided him to the bedroom. She was wearing the same tight pair of shorts that she had worn when they had danced together, and he couldn’t wait to see what they would look like in a dress. She sat him down on the bed, slipped the straps on her dress off her shoulders, and let gravity take it off. The material pulled tight against her breasts, displaying more of her pink areolas. The lace barely covered her nipples. He stared, but could take his eyes off her. His cock swelled, rising to full stiffness. He didn’t know that he was capable of that.</p> <p>She knelt in front of him, and he watched as her left hand took his cock in her right. He had never felt this hard and this much in his life. Her mouth felt incredibly soft and warm. She slid her lips over the head as her tongue began to lick down its length. The salty-sweet taste of her mouth gave way to the salty taste of his pre-cum as her tongue slid around the knob. She sucked it into her mouth gently, while she pulled at it with her lips. He felt a shudder run through his spine. She pulled it away from him, and opened her mouth and took him inside. She moved her head forward over his cock, and pressed her mouth to his belly. Her tongue pressed against the inside of his thigh and teased up the back of his leg. She made him come so hard that he had to fight not to come right there. He groaned his thanks to her lips and her tongue as he felt her mouth take him all the way to the back of her throat. It was almost too much, but if it was that hard to do with a man, it would make it worth it.</p> <p>She slid her left hand around the back of his neck to squeeze his ass cheek. He pushed back into her mouth when her teeth scraped over the flesh of his thigh. Her tongue danced over his thigh until it moved on it. Then she licked her way up to his balls, and flicked first one and then the other. When they were close to his cock, she took one into her mouth, gently sucking and licking it as she held his cock in her right hand. As it grew, she slid her lips over the head as his pubic hair tickled the inside of her cheek. He felt her fingers run down his ass to the crack of his ass and feel his anus contracting as she caressed him. This went on for a while, until she began to gently massage his prostate gland as she sucked hard on his cock. She let him push down on her head, and sucked with her mouth, her tongue licking every inch of his cock, not once did her mouth stop it from getting fully hard.</p> <p>She felt her panties getting tighter as he pulled his cock from her mouth and watched as her eyes sparkled. He felt his cock begin to grow in her hand as his head began to rise, harder, and larger, with each stroke. Her tongue danced wetly around the head and his moans filled the bedroom as he pushed downward, his ass up, holding her head. His balls tightened, as he tensed, he held on for several moments. Then his cum flew the first jet from his cock directly into her mouth. Her mouth felt warm and soft around his cock. She swallowed and swallowed. He groaned as her tongue played over his cum-slippery knob. The fluid felt sweet and sexy as it left his cock. She swallowed a couple of more times to get every last drop. When she had finished, she kissed the tip of his cock, then kissed his thighs, his balls, and his ass. He leaned back on his elbows to look out the window.</p> <p>She leaned down, his cock slipping from her mouth. He kissed the tip of her nose as he began to rub her breasts with the tip of his cock again. His cum dribbled down over the top of her breasts until it coated the left one before it was covered by the right one with even more of it. Then she did the same with the left. As his cock glistened with the moisture of her mouth, he lifted it from her breasts and watched as her nipples responded. He began to run his hand down along her thighs, and around the skin just inside her panties. He spread her legs and began to the sides, pushing, rubbing her. She shivering like a kitten.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>to move from the bed with the first—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
