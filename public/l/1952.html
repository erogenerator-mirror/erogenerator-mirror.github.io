Meditate often upon the connection of all things in the world;</strong> that is what I am doing. My name is Sune and all my skills have a purpose in life - a pleasure. My name here comes from the God of the Fates of the Fates of the Fates of the Fates of the Fates of the Fates of the Fates of the Fates of the Fates of the Fates of the Fates of the Fates of the Fates of the Fatesof the Fates of the Fates of the Fates to the best of my ability.</p> <p>I am a human being that is destined to be the most successful and perfect for my life when it comes to the love of my partner, my friend... and my soul mate.</p> <p>I had always had such a strong faith in my nature that it wouldn't have surprised me if that same faith had gotten me into that kind of mess, even on my end; and for that reason I felt like I was going to have to be a bit more careful in what I chose. At least, I did.</p> <p>In my culture, I've always been known for saving faces and taking risks. I did that pretty well in High School, but now I'm really starting to regret putting that much faith in my own faith, because for the last few weeks, I've been feeling a little... guilty. I'm scared that I might lose my place amongst the girls at school, and when they're looking at me as I'm coming in to take off that high heel and take off my clothes that's it, the day of my next week's Christmas party. I just hope that the whole party will go off without a hitch, because once I start to see that my own shyness and hesitance is finally about to hit, I'll probably have to be the one to make the first move.</p> <p>Well that wouldn't be quite fair, right? Not that I wouldn't be in a position to make the second move, of course. In my opinion, there are a lot of people that will probably think that's an out-of-body experience, so I'll spare you the details.</p> <p>First, I'd like to tell you that I'm not really that shy. I've gotten pretty drunk or maybe I'm just a little bit drunk, and I've even drunk on a few guys, which is really okay, but really they've just been doing weird shit that I've never even imagined, and I've been getting propositioned for a couple of hours, or maybe some dude had a few drinks and was sitting in his car just blowing me, and I've got a boner... or three... somewhere.</p> <p>I'm not that shy; I'm actually pretty confident about my self-control. I just haven't tried to hide it (or the fact that I've been looking at the girl at the party and my dick was getting hard, and there's a girl in the back seat of this car that isn't me; and there's even some guy in the back seat that I've never even seen before, but my dick is pretty small; if you haven't realized yet, I'm not some porno star that's pretty small, you know) and I am still very comfortable with myself.</p> <p>So I'm not a little bit scared right now (and not because of the state of my dick or its length - my dick's actually at least slightly smaller than average; but also because I've got a little bit of confidence in my dick to back up my own ideas; which is a big thing with me, considering that all I have is confidence). It takes a person to be self-assured about her own sexuality; and when that confidence is broken by a dick in her hand or mouth, well... that's something that comes with time.</p> <p>So I'm here now - about to suck the cock of another girl, while in her tight wet white skirt and heels and she has the dildo in my mouth. And as hard as I've been trying not to do it ever since I started to notice it, I can't just drop to my knees and suck on this cock of hers. I'm already half drunk and I'm just being a dick; and if I blow it into a girl's mouth now, that could be the end result of this situation that I've just created.</p> <p>But hey, I can blow it into a girl's mouth - not just for me, I can blow a blowjob into another girl, and then do it again. I don't even consider myself a dick-sucker, like I said earlier, and I'm not saying here that I'm not good at it. I find the experience of sucking someone's dick to be surprisingly unique (albeit I'm willing to say), and yet to be totally terrifyingly terrifying as well-equipped. So I don't need to say that I'm just looking at the dick is a lot and I'd like what it might evenâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
