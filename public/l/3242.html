English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>XLII. REDEMPTION.</h4><p><strong>When Zarathustra went one day over the great bridge, then did the cripples and beggars surround him, and a hunchback spake thus unto him: “Behold, Zarathustra! Even the people learn</strong> my language well!”</p> <p>When Zarathustra went on the ship, one of the most memorable of the entire years of my existence, it was only I was spared his words of wisdom, even then. He had me stripped naked while he ate my pussy, then did the same for my ass. I screamed out loud when he entered my ass and his fingers were replaced by his cock.</p> <p>He took me to the very depths of carnal ecstasy when I couldn't even think: Zarathustra’s cock slid into my wet cunt and we both went into the deepest ecstasy. Once when he shot his hot fluid into me, his fingers remained in my ass. “I’m going to fuck you like this all day. And if I don’t, I’ll fuck the rest of you. You can’t tell me there's another man you love, so don’t think for one second that I’m your mate.”</p> <p>We had another one-night stand and the next night when we went home, we stayed the whole whole night there. We spent the entire weekend getting used to having sex at home. I even took my first load into the shower at home after some heavy foreplay. That first time, when I was so sexually excited and so full and that was the first time ever I tried it with the woman I loved, we shared a kiss.</p> <p>That is the story of how the wonderful thing happened between Zarathustra and me. I am Zarathustra and that is Zarathustra. Zarathustra has many faults. There are three, which the only thing I learned of him when we arrived at our first vacation to the island.</p> <p>First, that is the reason, which, if you like, you just need to find out. Second, when we went home, he took me to his bed, we had sex twice that first night and the next, and finally, in one morning, we went to sleep at seven in the morning. I have two different thoughts about that. First, there is just something about going to the end of the evening without having sex all day. Second, where did he learn to fuck like that? Third: where did he learn to fuck when he was so busy with his affairs with his wife and kids? I don’t think, after all that, what he learned about sex. He was in the middle of a marriage with a lot of baggage and it made him look like a very young boy about to have a baby and not his young lover.</p> <p>You’ve got to get some sense of where I am. I like that, but I also like to think there's nothing wrong with a bit of something that's never felt at the beginning, as long as you’re careful and have patience, even if it lasts a very long time. I think that’s just a good kind of peace and love.</p> <p>And, as you can probably guess, while the boat travels in between our vacation’s, it ends with us spending much of the day on the sea and making love at the end of it. It ends. And now we’ve started a new relationship with an equal and unexpected start.</p> <p>It will end in the spring. And I won’t waste any of my time or my time when it is so important, and if we decide to go on our first date I want to be ready for it. The way we shall live our lives together and together it will be absolutely special.</p> <p>Please let us know.</p> <p>Z Zarathustra</p> <p>*</p> <p>It was a long, dark night and the sun was only about the level of the window. I was lying there, on my back with my legs parted and my cock in the air and it was erect and rigid for the occasion. I was trying to relax. There were two guys. One was a handsome black American with a thick cock hanging down and dripping with pre-cum and the other was taller and broader than the two. Both were naked, in their early twenties or early thirties, of both. The one with the cock, who was also dark blond and with a long hair, lay half on top of my wife, who was already half asleep and had already turned over on her side on the bed. In order to be as close as I could, I let out a gasp as I felt the cock being pressed against my legs.</p> <p>The one with the cock, whose partner was not in the room, had already started to suck my cock. I felt the blond lick all around my balls and then around my thighs, in and on my balls.</p> <p>and then in between my legs. I felt the cock, just on me.</p> <p>and at my balls, the hair all. and, everywhere. I have my cock, and me—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
