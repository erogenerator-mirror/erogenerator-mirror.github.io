At least, that’s what her mind was going to tell her, as it made her climax, and as her body was spasming with pleasure as it had during her fuck with Roger the week before, she had her own fingers inside her cunt and she could hear them moving softly, rhythmically.</p> <p>Evelyn liked the taste of her own pussy, as well as her husband after he was inside her, and after they had their fuck, as well as, for her own private lesbian affair with another woman and as soon as she was alone, to taste another woman as she had once watched, Evelyn turned to face herself on the floor of the hotel dining room table.</p> <p>But then she stopped her thoughts of things where she was and what she wanted to do and when she stopped thinking of everything around her because of her recent sexual experience with the woman she liked and liked watching while her husband sucked her nipples and fingered her cunt, her thoughts were now what she wanted to do with men, and what she wanted to give her husband, when he was there for her to suck or lick his cock.</p> <p>After feeling as excited as she always did when she had a hard time thinking about anything else but how she wanted her husband, and even when Roger had stopped kissing her to watch the show that he liked, before she had started thinking about herself to him, she had been on the cusp of wanting to give herself to her husband, but not just want to be with him.</p> <p>"Oh, Evelyn!," she groaned as she was pushed back down on the table.</p> <p>"I want to make love to you," she moaned in reply, as if she was about to tell her story to Peter and his story to Adam about how she needed to give herself to a lover as much as she needed to have her pussy filled with Roger's cock.</p> <p>"Are you sure," Evelyn asked.</p> <p>"Do you really want me?," Evelyn asked again as she sat up and put her hands on her knees. "Yes," she moaned, as she raised her left hand toward her breasts and her right hand to find her lips, as if it was Peter who had wanted this for a long time.</p> <p>"Mmmm!" she cooed as she slid her mouth toward her husband.</p> <p>Evelyn's pussy was wet from both Roger's and Peter's attention. They had both eaten her pussy more times than she could count, and this time, the attention was just as she had always wanted. Roger had her legs spread wide, and he had positioned himself between her legs. He was in front of her while her lover stood at the opposite edge of the table, and her eyes were on him as he held himself up with his arms and looked down at her.</p> <p>"Don't you, you little harlot!," he said as the head of his cock came into contact with Evelyn's pussy.</p> <p>"I am always wet when I'm with you, Roger," she moaned, as she watched her husband's shaft push itself into her womanhood.</p> <p>Roger looked down at Evelyn's eyes, and knew that he was in the right position to do this. He had never made love with a woman before, even though he had made love with one woman before. But he knew Evelyn loved him too, with or without his cock and her pussy and all of the other pleasures Roger could offer. And it had made him as hard as it had made him to make love with a woman, as it was now, when Evelyn had shown his cock the first time.</p> <p>Evelyn had given him what he wanted and she had loved him as much as he loved her, at least until he had to put his cock inside Evelyn's hungry cunt. But the love she had for Roger was no longer with the thought of a hard cock filling her body as it did with her pussy, as it did with everyone. It had been a very good fuck and a very wonderful fuck. Roger didn't know how Evelyn felt about him fucking her, and if he wanted to stay with her, but with her, he knew he needed to move into her and was ready to do that. She also, but he could move into her. He had just as his way to make everything. It didn't move into her, as he did his way up her body.</p> <p></p> <p>But the way, how his body and to she needed to get him into—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
