So there is a way to do that. You must take the time to read this, and then come to the next section. This is for future reference only.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>(AUTHOR'S NOTE: This is the story of a story I have written several years ago, when someone else, or some influence, had made the decision to make a long story for an erotic genre. It is based on many of these events, but now I have decided to publish it and then edit it to show some of the real world in the story for the public. In my time, the original author had written a story about how the readers of Literotica enjoyed reading stories of their own, describing how that experience had changed them. If you are a reader of erotica and would like to read something else, please use any bookmarklets and/or comments and rate.)</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>It was the spring of 1821. That is how time would have passed, or been. The two people of the story were sitting in a room together in the town of Sibium. The story was written at the request of an admirer and a companion of the reader in a town in the English colonies, and he wrote this story for them. I have been reading it here in a story featuring sex in the story, and I can tell you that although I enjoyed reading it a great deal, I never thought that it could be as sexy and arousing as these two things are, but it was very true, and if it was so...</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>When he arrived, he and a colleague from Sibium, two other scholars, were seated around his table talking. The other scholar was called Jandija, she was married to a scholar named Stefan from England. For the past five years, she and Jandija had been in a "situation," in which she has been the sole arbitrator of their future. And Stefan had been their guide, their confidante and as the only one of the three people she had "read the whole thing" in. He was there to protect them, to get them out of trouble, to take good care of them, and to keep them safe, especially when they needed him. He is not aware of anything the other scholar had done.</p> <p>Jandija was the first to speak. "When I was a sophomore in college. My friend Jandija was there; she met the scholar and married his son. It was just before they started their family, but she and her husband are living in France now to work in the city and she was looking for a family to stay the whole year."</p> <p>"A great family, and it was nice that we had three beautiful women." Jandija said and looked at Ebon. "Her husband Stefan is a student at Oxford and he is about to graduate; and I am on my third year of my education. He and I live alone as well; I had never met him before. He is a very handsome young man; he had just entered the military service for Europe, and the first time ever, we met. Stefan was a little younger than me, but not that handsome; he was twenty-seven. So we were only together for a few seconds; then, as a couple, we were introduced as the couple. But at some point, I lost my virginity. I'm sorry, but I was too young to remember what happened from then on. I remember that it was the second time in a very long time."</p> <p>"How do you feel as an old man?" Ebon asked her. "I am not used to having sex with you. Is it all right? Would you be ready to get back with him?"</p> <p>"Just a little bit. We do not have the same thing on the brain; I think it is better to be with men. I am pretty much happy with that; I have sex with men as men do, with all the men I know and love!"</p> <p>Everyone applauded her in a way she has never done. She continued to talk. "What about you? How will you be prepared to share that with me?"</p> <p>"I will come to Rome; I will try and be a monk as best as I can. I can't believe that I would enjoy it. I have never had sex with other men; the same with the other men who are only I enjoy, but who are not. Buto; the men only." Stefan and Stefan are there are no one man, I cannot be. If that can be from that Stefan. I love Stefan, who will be. Stefan and I not the world Stefanâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
