I have now heard all my neighbour’s history, at different sittings, as the housekeeper could spare time from</strong> day to day. But my favourite was this:</p> <p>It has been a very long time since my last orgasm. (A very, very long time. I remember, from the very first night of my last class: ‘Darling’. I don’t remember many words in my life. I have often wondered how one could possibly make up to the hours of my life). It was one such day, the first, one my life. But my teacher, Mrs O’Troy, is quite a different story. I had never thought of Mrs O’Troy as a teacher, but she seemed to be quite the opposite. She was very sexy, too. Very sexy, but not as much as the Headmistress of our school—a very sexy teacher. She was very, very attractive. She would make me very happy.</p> <p>‘This is my home away from home,’ she says, her eyes alight and twinkling as she smiles again at me. As a friend, she was very close to me. We often chatted, she told me, her eyes, her face, her voice, her tits—and so many things. But she was not my only teacher.</p> <p>She knows that I’m not going to masturbate, I know that, but I don’t mind. I find her so good looking, too! She told me a few weeks ago that she was a very popular teacher. She even said that she was married to an instructor. I don’t know what I felt about those words, but I was quite happy about them. My teacher loves to say things to me. And, for that very reason, it was very, very natural to talk about these things with her. I could really tell it was really good! I told her I was an excellent teacher, and that I would love to have sex with her, but she would have to do something for me. She told me to kneel down before her, and suck my penis. She said that she would teach me how to give proper oral sex. I could not even begin to ask how to do that. I had never heard of such things. I knelt in front of her, kneeling, and slowly licked her pussy!</p> <p>She said very gently:</p> <p>‘Honey, I have told you this:’ she had the most wonderful sex, so I could not ask anything of you.’ I could only lie, I didn’t have to look up to see her smiling.</p> <p>‘Yes, your pleasure really counts. Now, it is your turn,’ she smiles. I thought that she would have me, if it were just for my own pleasure. She was so sexy, her eyes, her skin, her hair. She had a long shapely neck, so nice and smooth, and her whole body shimmered in a way that seemed to go on forever. It was as if she knew that I was looking at her, and she knew that I was, and she knew that that was what I was looking at her. She has long graceful legs of her own, from her thighs all the way up to her panties.</p> <p>My mouth had never been as wet and eager as it was right now. She was always so willing, and I could imagine what she must be thinking with all her heart. I was already aroused, I could feel it in my own groin.</p> <p>I wanted it, I wanted her so badly. I wanted to do anything for her. I want to be as good as she is to her. I want to be hers… but I have never, not even with her. I said so. Her voice is very soft and gentle, and she said that she did not usually bring herself to talk like this. She took both of my hands, put them on her big tits, and said: ‘I know you want me,’ and she kissed me. The feel of her breasts and my hands on them got me even more excited. My own arousal rose to the point that I could not resist. I began to caress her breasts, massaging them, rolling the nipples between my thumb and forefinger. I felt her hand on my cock—her fingers moving up and down. As I could not help myself, I put my lips on hers. Her mouth had a silky sweetness. Her mouth was very warm, I could even feel it on mine. I found myself kissing her with all my strength, as my penis, which was starting to get erect, started to throb.</p> <p>Her pussy is so sweet! I was so hard, and ready for her. I wanted her. I got onto my knees and went on my knees, and knelt before her, and sucked her. I wanted that pussy. My tongue could not even tried to be inside her, to kiss her as—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
