Like wild birds, he had chosen this desert place to construct his nest. He fumbled in his waistcoat</strong> pockets until he found the hidden package in his car. He slipped it on and then he was astride the seat and his cock slid happily into the tightest pussy ever. He fucked it and fucked it so good he could taste it's salty taste in his mouth.</p> <p>"You want me for your birthday?" Jean Valjean moaned throatily. "You want this? Fuck! This's for you! Fuck! Fuck baby! God this is so good!"</p> <p>Jean Valjean wasn't sure if he believed in her after she fucked him that day. She was the sex goddess of dreams, and that was only partly true. Jean Valjean fucked! And she loved every second of it. Oh, Jean Valjean was in love but she was just so happy. And yes, it was love. Her own husband hadn't been a total idiot all his life, and he was a damn good judge of character. There was a part of him that thought he must like to throw caution to the wind; but Jean Valjean wasn't her lover! They could never be. Oh, she was his. Jean Valjean was just the kind of woman she liked to be around. In fact...and he knew he had to fuck her. And soon.</p> <p>She was moaning all the way back to Dubois and once again she was naked and so am I. Then his cock was up in her and they were fucking passionately, her legs round his waist and her arms round his neck as he fucked her. He was fucking Jean Valjean. The one girl he loved and cherished and wanted and was fucking at least once everyday of his life. He loved her and she loved him. He felt like an utter heel. Well, it wasn't a heel because she was his. But one. One who he loved and trusted more than he loved to fuck.</p> <p>Jean Valjean had finally become so happy. Now that everything was happening it was a joy to be inside her. She smiled at him and then she smiled at him. She held him and caressed him and kissed him and talked to him and he was totally happy. "I want you. More now than ever before. Come with me," she whispered softly. "Come out of that boring house and we can have a long weekend."</p> <p>They took her to a room on the outskirts of Dubois Estates which was very dark and still. It still had all of the usual signs of an old castle. All her furniture looked the same, and all the lights were the same as she had left. They moved and Jean Valjean let him undress her and undress her. She was beautiful. She had beautiful curves, which were always very voluptuous. She undressed him slowly and his cock rose from his crotch and she kissed him and kissed him and tasted him. She looked at him and felt a small smile as she stroked him and enjoyed his look of desire and desire. She could only remember every second of his body. His face, his face! And his hair and his face. He was all to she. She wanted to make love to him. She wanted him naked and fucked. And she wanted him inside her. She wanted every aspect of him.</p> <p>"This," she said to him then. "Is my world. I'm going to fuck you." Then she kissed him again. Their lips were wet and soft, and his cock throbbed inside her pussy as she stroked him. Her fingers were tight and she wrapped her legs around him and pulled him into her. "Fuck me now. Fuck me!" she whispered. "I told you I love you. Fuck me! Fuck me."</p> <p>Her words and his cock were too much for him. He pressed his head against her cervix. She wrapped her legs around his waist and held on tight. Her voice was soft and throaty. "Yes. Just like that! Oh...yes. Yes," she whispered. Her eyes closed and she rode him gently with her eyes shut. His cock ached for her; it needed more. His heart throbbed for her and he was so excited he was afraid she wouldn't be ready for him. Her voice was wet and hot. "Fuck me like this," she whispered. "Make love to me!" And to him, too.</p> <p>She had never felt so complete. Her body was aching to be fucked. She wanted him inside her and she wanted him to fuck her. He'd fucked hundreds, and many had come close to fucking her. All of their relationships had been short. They were too much for one another. And she wanted to be fucked like that too. Hard. And she needed his cock inside her. She needed her lover to fuck her.</p> <p></p> <p>Jean Valjondra's voice was all his but his own words. He heard her words. She felt her words. l—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
