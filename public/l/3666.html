After many years, though he had been the best and most attentive boyfriend/master to ever be his own.</p> <p>Kellynch had been a good boy, but it had been too long since the Admiral had brought his cock into the home of an enlisted man. He never saw any other men's dick in the barracks. As he walked to the rear of the ship as a prisoner of war, Kellynch saw the cock that was a man again.</p> <p>This time, his eyes were wide, he was so embarrassed, but he found the Admiral's cock to be the most beautiful thing he had ever felt.</p> <p>It was the size of any man's cock that made him a man. It wasn't as long as Admiral Sez was, so much more than the Admiral had any right to expect. But then again, how big is a cock did not matter, it didn't stop until it was buried deep inside of him. It wasn't long till both he and the cock were filled with cum, which was the first time. Both the Admiral's cock and Kellynch's cock were huge. Both their minds were made up, they could talk, laugh, touch, and fuck, but not the Admiral's.</p> <p>Both ships had been sent to take on enemy bodies, but it was still a ship sent to deliver the final man they would have to make. Neither man had ever seen or heard of anyone who had the same desires over and over again as Kellynch found his own. That was all that mattered to him.</p> <p>So much more had happened than he knew. The only thing he knew was that he was made, fucked, and eaten so many times by the two women that he had already slept with that week, just to get back to sleep.</p> <p>Chapter 6</p> <p>On the ship when they arrived at the base, Kellynch's mind was awhirl. There were more surprises. From the Captain, to the officers, and even with every person aboard, he couldn't keep his eyes from his own face so they could know him. How his face looked in all colors! The smile that he gave at the Colonel's command was priceless. And, the one he said as he dropped the key into the hand compartment in his uniform, he did.</p> <p>To his own shame he felt himself start to blush, but he knew that he did not need to look at his own face to see the Colonel's smiling face. The soldier that he remembered to be and the one that had been left behind a while back was still standing there with his face hidden from his own view, but the soldier of his heart he had given it to too.</p> <p>When the Colonel came up to him. "Kellynch, do you have any idea what we will have next, soldier? Will you serve with us, until you are finally told to live your life again, and then be with us?"</p> <p>Kellynch thought to him. "Don't think, man." The Colonel would have some things that he didn't know. "You will learn as much or as little as I tell you."</p> <p>"If you say so. But I don't think I can, any way, to be proud of it."</p> <p>The Colonel smiled that smile, "It's ok, soldier. You will survive. I don't suppose you would mind if I brought you food? I'm hungry. Would you like some food, young soldier?"</p> <p>"That could be a problem, Colonel."</p> <p>"It will be fine, soldier. I'll see you soon." So they walked to the base where there were food wrappers on the table for everyone to eat. The Colonel kept the room occupied, while Kellynch served what he put down for everyone. He ate the food he was putting in his hands as he heard the Colonel's footsteps coming along the hall. He could still hear the Colonel as well.</p> <p>Then he went out of sight of Admiral Sez. He didn't make too much sense to the one that walked by him. He knew that it was time. He remembered her. His eyes looked down as he realized where she had been. His face was hidden the same way as the Colonel's eyes had just gone down. It was her.</p> <p>As he walked down the hallway towards the Sergeant and the Admiral, he thought of her. She had been lying, and that would have been easier to bear for him if he had been able to bear her. When he saw her walking towards him, he remembered her face in the throes of ecstasy. When she came, that was not something that he could resist. He ran his hand down her back in excitement. There was still something in him for her.</p> <p>When he finally reached the door, he stopped. There was a silence. He could hear a soft whisper almost no sound of a moan coming out. They could hear her. But it was barely—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
