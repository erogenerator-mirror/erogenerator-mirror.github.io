Not necessarily to the same degree, but to a variety of different degrees, it is just two lovers, loving and sex-obsessed.</p> <p>For some couples, or just simple sex partners, the third and fourth levels of relationship work quite well. They make love, fuck, and fuck until you're sore and exhausted from the action and you think 'oh, God, what a sex-mad year!'</p> <p>For others, it is fun, leisure, romantic, all-around sex, all the time being loved and being loved from head to toe. Sex is so very much fun. And so very long lasting. And to think that one day, this might be the only night that I'll have.</p> <p>The Endâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
