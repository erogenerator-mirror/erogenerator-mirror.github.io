The Colosseum</h4><p><strong>Franz had so managed his route, that during the ride to the Colosseum they passed not a single ancient ruin, so that no preliminary impression interfered to mitigate the colossal</strong> Slut in Hell.</p> <p>However it was not a good time. A heavy door bell rumbled, signaling the end of the night. Franz was on his way down the staircases of the Temple. He entered a small entrance room, in the very dim light illuminated by a single dim light bulb hanging on the end in the ceiling. After entering the room Franz took a seat on the edge of the bed, his head resting in the palm of his hand, his eyes glancing up at the wall behind him to see his partner in crime, a cute little guy with dark blue uniform pants and a white tee. Franz was lying on top of the sheets in their room, as he was about to take off his shirt and pants when a knock on the door.</p> <p>"Hey", Franz said. "Are you ready for bed?"</p> <p>"Of course. I've just finished in there," Franz responded with a smile.</p> <p>"I mean, its only seven so its still daylight out so what goes on down here stays where it is." The girl, wearing an old t-shirt was holding up a pair of jeans.</p> <p>"You've got to stop that, I want to go home before I fall asleep."</p> <p>"Why? Don't you need clothes?"</p> <p>"We don't talk about this," Franz said. "I am tired and I want to be anywhere but here."</p> <p>"Oh, okay," she said with a grin. So we need to get in bed first, I mean you can stay the night as long as you need to." At that moment Franz gave a little yank on the button on his own shirt. The girl's eyes widened even more, her head snapping up to look at him.</p> <p>"But what about the girl downstairs?" Franz asked. "She can see us?"</p> <p>"You should do something," she offered.</p> <p>"Come on! Be happy!" He began removing his clothes. In less than a minute there were two naked girls standing in front of him, each of them looking at his body with a gaze. Franz just shrugged and looked away, embarrassed that they were watching him strip down in front of them. When he was naked, he rolled over onto his stomach, stretching his back to the side, his feet planted firmly on the ground with a bit of wobbly motion. Two gorgeous young women appeared from around the corner.</p> <p>"Hi there, I've got your friend the other door, he's going to be up soon," he said.</p> <p>"I don't think we should be so bold." The gorgeous blonde said to her friend with a huge smile. She looked down to meet her gaze squarely on the huge bulge tenting his black underpants, while the brunette leaned across to kiss him passionately, their lips pressing together, their tongues intertwined.</p> <p>"You're not going to regret it," she said, pulling back and looking him in the eye. "But this is one of the rules on a girl's clothing, and we need to keep up with their rules."</p> <p>"Well that's really kind of scary," the girl said after the second girl pulled away. "They're kind of cute."</p> <p>"Yeah well, they're not just girls," Franz answered, "They're also girls."</p> <p>"Well it doesn't have to be for sex. I mean we all know about the boys, and the school is full of guys anyway," she smiled down at the girl. "Besides we just have to go with boys."</p> <p>"'Kay," Franz replied. He was already looking down at his cock. He could tell by the tone of her voice that she was serious. The last thing she wanted to do was to get him to stay hard with her.</p> <p>"You go ahead, come and lie down on the bed," she said as she turned off the lights in the room. "I'm sure there will be a little bit of darkness before you go."</p> <p>"I'll be right behind you", Franz said. At that moment Franz began undressing himself himself, as his cock stuck straight out towards three feet tall. The girl didn't even blink a little and stood back away from the bed with a sad face, before pulling out the mattress cover. Once the cover was pulled over Franz's shoulders, he was surprised when his cock started to harden.</p> <p>"Okay, that's better, I think I'll enjoy the bed," she said as she climbed the bed.</p> <p>"I feel like I'm going to wake up in a hospital," Franz added as he lay down face up on the bed. He closed his eyes, enjoying the feeling of feeling her warm skin on his head and cheeks.</p> <p>on his tongue, he heard she pushed him down next to rest on his side, turned up onto his back. She took a couple of his own knees. They continued that side, his legs, he felt her hands slidingâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
