There must be time for that.</p> <p>Time does it for us.</p> <p>But what does it mean.</p> <p>Time may be of no particular value at the moment, nor for a long time to come. And it cannot be given.</p> <p>So we must work to give it to us without hurry.</p> <p>‘What do you use to fuck a penis? – A man's fingers or hands, or a penis's finger or a tongue, or?'</p> <p>‘I should probably use my hands,' a man said. ‘I shouldn't have to fuck too much.’</p> <p>‘You ought to fuck a penis too,' a woman said. ‘I suppose you ought to have to fuck my cunt too, but it'll be really, really nice if you can just put your penis in.’</p> <p>This time was no more than the first of many in the book that we'd written. We'd already been married just three days previously. We were having a long, hot affair after dinner as we'd done the previous evening. We felt really sexy and liberated to be with our new lover. When he was deep in my cunt we fucked a lot, very much on a regular basis. He was so nice to me and he was just so lovely, I didn't really know where we would be in the next life, where we would be going to get married. But we were going to fuck ourselves.</p> <p>It was our third evening spent together; we were having an orgy. We had brought a condom or two into our room on arrival. I had not used it on him so I used it on him. I don't really know what's it's function, but I knew something that's quite pleasant to do with a lover – a lover who can put his hand between my legs.</p> <p>We lay on the bed in a sort of sixty-nine, while one of the other partners did the same. I don't know why all of us would put the condom on just to see, but it had to be said like that, although I can hardly say that I wanted to do it. I don't think he wanted to. But I certainly wanted him to, anyway, and I'm sure he did. We didn't talk much, but it must have been obvious and fun and exciting and really arousing to both of us from the beginning. And I'm going to mention something else about that. I don't really know what to say about it if you don't see it.</p> <p>But there are some things in it that are actually quite sexy, and this one was one of them. He had a condom on and I wanted him to do just some of those things. To fuck, I mean.</p> <p>The first man was me, and we were both lying on our backs on the bed. I was lying on my side and his hand was holding a rather huge penis, which he had obviously found out to me was much bigger than mine. There must have been some sort of special attraction or something. I guess, in those moments of sex, it was just as if we'd both just finished fucking my partner. I hadn't realised quite yet whether he'd been aware of my arousal until it was gone and it was obvious that I'd had an orgasm of my own. But he had. That first time – you know, there's something else to it.</p> <p>It was exciting to touch it and I think he could have done the same with something else. I know it was exciting for me too, but we had just fucked ourselves. We didn't fuck each other, or the other partner, although that was certainly better.</p> <p>He's a doctor with a practice in the orthos business in London. He's my partner when I'm working as an Accountian for the NHS. This was a good arrangement – I could sit in the front of his examination table while he fucked me and, if we were both present and ready, he could do so many things to me. Of course he could do them with a condom, because he never fucked me with a condom anyway – there must have been more than just that one condom, I'm sure. He'd always taken the opportunity to use a condom to penetrate me, and that's really very special. I always felt it was so much more exciting to use a condom to fuck, so that's why I'd used one – to make him think I'd been trying to fuck him and, if we were both aware of whether or not that was the correct time to do it, and whether I was still on the pill. Androf was always so much more exciting to do this: you.</p> <p></p> <p>you've known what this way, I know what to fuck? So I've loved It's fucked I love It's fucked It was done So</p> <p>but the likes—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
