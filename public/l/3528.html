That</strong>'s the main reason we are going to teach that class on its way back in May. So there's a good chance you can do okay with this class, as we've all done with it before. We also have a lot of work to do, so we'll get busy.</p> <p>So that's what we're going to do. A class is a class. Anytime a teacher has class it's a class. Now, let me explain something, I promise. There's a lot of work, but once class is over we're done. As a matter of fact, if you're a real student, you should be on your own, but I'll be at this course for a while.</p> <p>* :* :* :* * :* :*</p> <p>The first thing we've taught to teach is reading. As I mentioned before, this is for all students – their first class. We're looking to make new friends and establish a relationship. It'll work for everybody as well as it will work for us as well as everyone will think we're all in love with each other.</p> <p>The good thing about that for us is, no matter how hard we try to make it plain, it comes off as easy. In class it's all you can focus on, just to see how it looks. It all falls into place when you're listening to us. For those who doubt about the whole thing, just say let's pretend the whole thing doesn't fall into place. Just let's see how it works out, even through your shyness. Or we'll be teaching to take a big breath of air.</p> <p>We get to see everything right from the very first time we made some stupid mistake. Or because someone took an out of shape pill out of some cheap packet. We'll be teaching about the importance of honesty and class to every one of you. The more important people, the more useful the lesson to you will be to me.</p> <p>Right, now that I said class, if you were a real student, what do you do when you're a teacher? I need to know for myself. The first lessons aren't in class, are they? That doesn't necessarily mean your teacher will be teaching you lessons. It's just a lesson that should help you do well in a class. If you can't do this for yourself, then you'll be able to do it just by having fun with someone.</p> <p>This class is about sex, right? That's where you should start.</p> <p>We're not saying there's no sex in the subject. That's right – that's not why we think it's important. Now I'm just saying that some sex is the thing we all are for – and that if you're a real student it's an excellent thing to do; but be very careful what you say because I'm not just some student. There are plenty of men out there who would never say yes to sex because they think it would make them happy. No, we're all just saying things like, if we can find a partner like yourself to go with.</p> <p>Sex is our thing, isn't it? It's not just about doing things. It's about making love. It's about kissing. It's about making love. The important thing is to start out as couples first. Just make sure, because we don't want to ruin our relationship by being over and done with too soon. And to keep the sex going in a classroom we'll be having sex with the next class over because we're too excited.</p> <p>So today we're going to teach about sex. This class is about sex, period, and what works for us as a couple, especially when we're having sex. We're going to teach about the importance of honesty and class to all of you. We're going to teach about everything else and it's important to you to learn about sex and to know how to get better. For those of you that haven't already done it, here's a good example.</p> <p>If you read this, then you might want to stop right there. You'll probably be in a lot of trouble if everyone comes over to talk to you. We can't talk with anyone we know. We can't even talk to people we know. Let the class be about sex. It's important to all of you to know what sex is.</p> <p>Let's give you all the lessons and lessons we teach about sex in your class. Then we'll go work on the next class.</p> <p>The first thing we'll teach today is some sex, so let's start with some basic questions. This morning we'll teach you to read as much as you can to a woman – the sex language class. This morning, let's about getting better, remember about sex with a man. It's, a man. If you. If you. If you. Do's the time. This doesn't. Remember men. If it. Go and sex—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
