The Wood-Sawyer</h4><p><strong>One year and three months. During all that time Lucie was never sure, from hour to hour, but that the Guillotine would strike off her husband’s head next day. Every</strong> time a good night's dinner or movie seemed to pass by her mind, she wondered if it would continue.</p> <p>At least Lucie was aware of their future future and her future was certain to be positive. She had become the love of her life and was going to be a great girlfriend without the complications of marriage. Lucie needed sex. Well she needed love too, the joy of sex.</p> <p>Lucie had only just graduated college, at the age of twenty she had been waiting for the right chance for a good time in sex. It was all of those worries that were always there, but were ignored or ignored in her life. Instead of having sex just yet, Lucie decided to wait until she was married, her parents would be home any minute and her father always came home early. She couldn't wait to be married.</p> <p>One week of early Saturday sex had come to Lucie with a wonderful promise. She never dreamed that she'd feel sex like that, that she could feel love. Lucie's passion for sex was her greatest friend but now it was just one man.</p> <p>Lucie was a good student and was studying abroad in the UK. The best part about it was being at home and away from all of that formal stuff. Lucie loved being around people. She loved the conversations. She loved the atmosphere. She really got into the whole thing. So did her parents and they loved her for it.</p> <p>And then there was the fact that Lucie had been watching her father. His cock, as a woman would see it now that she realised it. She had never been with another man but now that she was, she couldn't think of anyone else. She loved that cock. And her body.</p> <p>The first time Lucie had ever watched her father she had watched him. He didn't look like anything except the guy who took care of himself, the guy who was her best friend. He could have been the guy who came home alone. Lucie watched him masturbate. She liked watching when his cock had grown hard then when he came. She would lay back and listen to him stroke it and imagine that his cock was that big she loved and his cock made her body feel good. She came a lot after watching him stroke his cock. God, she loved watching it.</p> <p>Lucie had longed for someone to give her a son, but no one was going to happen to her now, not another man. She couldn't believe that she had such a great opportunity and knew that nobody would want to marry her either.</p> <p>This was a good time. It was the day of a great wedding party. Lucie made friends with some of her classmates and a few other friends. But none of them looked as good as her father. He was tall, he had beautiful black hair, that he swept back with his hands and looked very sexy. He was always looking at Lucie's body and she was smiling and admiring herself.</p> <p>He was always looking more than her. She was wearing a long white frock dress which had long lacy sleeves and low tops which left just a couple of inches of skin between the tops and the sleeves. It was very thin and Lucie could see that even through the white fabric her nipples were showing and that made her feel really sexy and desirable. And it was the kind of dress that should have been worn by a fashion catalogue.</p> <p>At fifty-eight Lucie was still beautiful and she knew that. She felt that way when she was looking at her. She still looked good to the eye.</p> <p>She had noticed her father before. She couldn't really remember him, but she knew that it was his eyes, that look that made her think that someone had to look pretty. Maybe there had been one time when she was young and he had looked so very sexy. Maybe he wanted Lucie now that he was old, but he looked a lot younger than that. He may look younger and Lucie loved that about her.</p> <p>Lucie made her mind up as she moved towards her dad's car to go and find a friend to talk in and to dance with. It was only a few minutes after they had left the party she heard her dad. They made their way to the dance floor and her father asked her if she'd dance with him. She was delighted. It made her feel good. No pressure. No holding back.</p> <p>Lucie danced with her dad and he was still very sexy. It was nice dancing with him and making him feel desirable. And he wanted her to feel sexy. It was fun making love to him even after a lot of time went by. And he didn't have to give her a lot of money to do a lot of dances and she had said that she wanted to him. she wouldn't have more to be happy. She couldn't think.</p> <p></p> <p>When Lucie got home the chance to say to tell her—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
