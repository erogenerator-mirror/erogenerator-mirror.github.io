Valentine</h4><p><strong>The night-light continued to burn on the chimney-piece, exhausting the last drops of oil which floated on the surface of the water. The globe of the lamp appeared of a</strong> large white globe which appeared to be still rising above a blue sea but seemed to continue rising as the sun did.</p> <p>He rose from the bed that he had slept in and sat down next to her on the bed. She looked at him, her body tingling with pleasure as she took his hand and placed them on her thigh.</p> <p>"This is you," she said, "we'll finish when we're ready."</p> <p>"But I already had a lot of preparation," he said while kissing her lips and moving up her cheek to her lips. She kissed him back passionately but she was nervous. When they finally broke the kiss he said, "Relax," again leaving no doubt she belonged to him. When they returned to bed he pushed her shoulders back so that she was leaning against the pillows. He moved in between her legs and spread them apart just as the other side of the bed was about to come up on top of the stack. The bed squeaked at the impact his weight had sent at each of its sides.</p> <p>"What I meant," she whispered to him, "was that preparation is only half-brought-up."</p> <p>"Now that," he said while running his tongue over her nipples, "I have some serious questions to ask."</p> <p>"We'll do whatever you want," she said, her voice husky with desire.</p> <p>He climbed off of the bed and sat there for a moment, waiting for her to reply. When she didn't he got out of bed and walked to the window opposite the bed. Through it her breasts wobbled with each step he took and his cock seemed to swell with anticipation. She looked at him with her eyebrow raised and a sly smile on her lips as she held out her arms and beckoned him to come closer.</p> <p>He climbed into the bed right behind her. He grabbed her under her arms and hoisted her up on his lap. She was still looking at him and he leaned in to touch her nipple with his tongue which made her body twitch. She moved her hand through his hair pulling his head close to her and pressed herself against him. He kissed her neck and moved his hand down the front of her body to her clit and rubbed it. She spread her legs apart for him and he stroked her opening with his fingers making her jump. She wanted him inside her, but in that position her body wouldn't accommodate.</p> <p>"I don't think there's a thing you can do with me without having a cock inside of you." He said this while she squirmed around from his touch.</p> <p>"There's not a thing I can do better," she said.</p> <p>They kissed, their tongues exploring each other's mouths and exploring each other's bodies. She pulled him down and he felt her nipples against his stomach as she pulled his shirt off. She took his jeans off as they kissed.</p> <p>"I want to be with someone tonight," she said.</p> <p>He could hear in her voice how sexy she was and wondered if he could make her cum. He put one arm round her and put a leg between hers. She felt his cock in her pussy and he had to be sure no more would happen. He put a knee between her legs but kept his cock in her pussy.</p> <p>"You're already fucked, don't worry," he said.</p> <p>"Just wait," she told him.</p> <p>He put his fingers up to her mouth to get her to suck his fingers. She moved them over her tongue and made a show of sucking them one after another.</p> <p>"No, no, don't."</p> <p>He turned her on her side to look at him.</p> <p>"So you'll just have to wait," he said, "I need to see you naked and naked I mean."</p> <p>She lifted her hand to her breast which felt like a rock and it looked so inviting to have him see. It wasn't long before she was wearing a white shirt and black lacy bra. He could see her nipples were erect and he had a feeling it might be one big hard nipple that was going to get a lot of teasing. When he put his hand over the top of her bra she gasped but didn't stop him. He squeezed it over her and saw her nipple rise in response, which made him feel great.</p> <p>"You look so fantastic naked and so vulnerable," he told her.</p> <p>"But we still haven't done anything."</p> <p>"There's a good chance you will," he said, kissing her again. He rolled over so that she was on her back. He moved between her legs and lifted them with his arms so that he could see her.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"That's so lovely to look." I'm a wonder of all for you like you</p> <p></p> <p>"Now my eyes like "and look all like"My eyes in?"</p> <p>"Myâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
