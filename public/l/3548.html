There I was stark naked in a hotel room in which I am well known in the gay community. I had to wear a strap-on but I felt that this was the right thing to do because it allowed me to experiment outside my conservative beliefs.</p> <p>The only thing was that I was so horny I stripped off my clothes and hopped onto the bed. Then I moved my legs apart and lay on my back. I had to use a condom because I'm a very cautious person.</p> <p>I turned towards my lover and looked at the ceiling. I wanted to take his virginity and be his first. I wanted a nice passionate lovemaking session. I wanted to be the one that made it hard for him to think, but he was a guy just so he would be the one to ask me to do it. So I just lay there and wondered if that was my decision to make. But before I could really contemplate my answer, a knock came at the door.</p> <p>The door opened and there stood a tall, dark-haired man in a hotel slacks and a white shirt. He looked extremely nice because he did sport a good body. He had an athletic body and he wore a tie.</p> <p>"So, you've been reading my book about how to be a man."</p> <p>"Oh," I said. "Well, I guess I have but I don't know what I am."</p> <p>"So when do you want to start the session?"</p> <p>"Uh ... do you have any idea why I'm wearing a strap-on?"</p> <p>"Well, I think we have a pretty good idea. Do you think you can handle it?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I suppose so."</p> <p>"So," he looked as if he knew it was more difficult to go slow because after everything that had happened, it would be hard to maintain control. "How does a good dick-sucker like you want to make it? Tell me that you are ready for this."</p> <p>"I do," said my love. He got on his knees on the bed. He then crawled up to me and got between my legs. I didn't expect his cock because I was already getting wet. But he took his time, slowly lowering his cock into my pussy. He was only about an inch or so into me. When he reached around to massage my tits, it felt amazing. I had not thought I would get such a nice feeling after watching him at the movies on the Internet.</p> <p>The feeling of his cock pushing between my lips were more than I could take and I felt as if my legs would literally vibrate. I wanted some sort of relief so I reached down to my own pussy and started fingering myself. With that, I felt myself getting closer until my entire body tensed and my whole body went rigid and I felt like I was going to die, but all that happened was that the feelings were so exquisite that I couldn't find my breath. I could tell he had felt that too as he started to thrust into me very very slow. He was very gentle and even took his time. I was not really sure if he was ready for me to have an orgasm just because of the length of him inside me. I couldn't be sure, but I suspect that he felt the same way because he started to thrust that faster and harder than I had ever heard him moan before. I felt like I just had to take a shit in order to feel pleasure with his cock inside me.</p> <p>When I heard his breathing became heavier and he moaned, I felt his body tense up. He let out a high-pitched exclamation and suddenly I had a gush of juices in my pussy. It was like nothing I had ever felt before and it felt almost indescribable. My pussy was overflowing and there was a lot of sperm leaking from my love hole. After his final thrust, he got off his knees and looked at me.</p> <p>"Wow," I said smiling. "Wow. I can imagine."</p> <p>As I stood up, all the blood that had been deprived was coursing through my body again and I felt much of the same thing; an erection. I could hardly walk.</p> <p>He had now recovered from his orgasm and had got back on his knees, but he didn't take off his shoes or pants. He stood on the bed, got back on the bed again and this time he climbed on top of me and took his time slowly inserting himself into me. He felt wonderful so much better than the first hand job and. His penis did. I thought. It was the long and I wouldn't feel like my first hand. I thought and not but it and I knew that after he was just the most of all of my cunt.
