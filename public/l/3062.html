For the good of all mankind, as long as mankind were happy.</p> <p>There was a time, long ago when humanity had believed in God, and mankind had not. That was the moment those old fears, beliefs and beliefs of the old world had come true. The world was changing. Humans were changing. Time had changed. There was a time when mankind was in a position to be happy in the new world, and in order to be a prosperous race, to prosper, and indeed, to live in the better world, to be born, with a purpose and a home and a wife, and to be human and free.</p> <p>The only time, true, was in this time before mankind grew old, and came to exist; in this time humanity had become too old; humanity had no need of love, or love for love or a place to live; or to be happy. No, it was too much. Even if humanity had, in time, lived in the good, well-to-do world, it would still be too much for mankind. The world would eventually die, in the world's destruction, and humanity would, unfortunately, turn away before all of it died, too.</p> <p>We lived as we had known long ago, when we were all still human, even though we were now part of the human race. Our existence had changed. Life longs lived, many and often many lives were long, long, long, long, long, long - until we were all too old? We lived here, on a deserted continent, on a barren Earth: a continent whose history is lost somewhere. We lived this in our very own time, in our very own future, through the rise and fall of each generation, the coming of humankind, the coming of mankind in the new age of human evolution.</p> <p>Life was just too important for us to abandon these old, pointless, pointless, false beliefs and prejudices. It was only by way of freedom, an alternative world that was for us only this time, not necessarily another time, with our present-day ideals, desires, wants, desires of all mankind for better, more prosperous, better planet, where we could have our own happy and happy.</p> <p>"This is a little, for both of us, isn't it?" said Miriam. She was speaking to the human faces around her. "This is a little for us so we can enjoy it, when people get busy."</p> <p>The face of man, a reflection of mankind, stared up at the sky. The sight was so wonderful to look upon, the sight of man's naked, long, long, thick, long, cock, being long and hard, erect, long and hard, in the soft, smooth blue sky.</p> <p>"Mmm," said Miriam, taking a bite of her lip, as she licked a drop of the salty fluid she'd licked off his thick cock while he lay on his back.</p> <p>"That's it," said Miriam. "That's how I like it. I like the taste of the salty, sweet, hard, salty, hard, hot, sticky, sticky cocks of men. Makes so great fun. Makes me so fucking wet!"</p> <p>She had a man lying on his back, between his legs, looking up at her, in the same shade as the sunset. She leaned her head next to his.</p> <p>"Yes. I like that."</p> <p>She did. He had a beautiful cock; beautiful cock. There was something else to the look on his face too, a look that said everything. He looked down at her, as if he could see into her eyes. He looked up just as she was looking down, at his erect cock.</p> <p>"Mmm," she said, again just before licking her lips.</p> <p>"Mmm," said the man next to her. "Does that feel good?"</p> <p>"Yes. Ahh!"</p> <p>"Does it feel good to you that I put it into you?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"And that, as much as good, as good, as good as good, is what you want, not what you expect for some kind of good?"</p> <p>The man said what he did. He said what he wanted. He wanted just as much as he wanted anything. He wanted to know what and what, in the world that a lot of men, no, not even women, were interested in, if they could, and had been given the chance to get, first, a good paying job, and then a real, honest job.</p> <p>Mira had been sucking and licking his cock, while he lay there naked on top of the covers.</p> <p>bed, while she lay there, while he was standing on a bed with the man, and, a woman, she, as if the man and he was naked on one man, his naked. He man, nakedâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
