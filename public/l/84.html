Rider Haggard </h3><h4>CHAPTER XXIII The Doom of the Fire</h4><p><strong>We stood in the third cave that was carpeted with white sand and alive with rosy light. Making a dark stain upon that snowy sand was a black patch of</strong> the moon above us. Our lovemaking was as slow as an art statue. There were no words, and no plans, to describe the sight of another man's penis buried deep, buried to the balls inside me as he made me cum to a climax that would be mine for eternity. My head rolled back and forth by this hour and the moonlight flashed on my naked body. I felt my orgasm rip through me, spreading itself over my senses and mind. A soft moan escaped of pleasure. My whole body shuddered, wriggling, thrashing as climaxes of pure delight swept over my body. I was a happy panther, a true wild animal being driven wild by passion. I felt that my juices were flowing from my cunt lips, dripping down to my ass crack, as if my body was seeking out the hot fluids dripping from my body. I felt my heart beat and throb as if a heartbeat was rushing through me, as if my life force was aching to be filled. My body's desires were alive and strong. I could only stand there as my mind reeled and thrashed within my thoughts.</p> <p>My mind seemed to be in a swirl as I came back to our world and it seemed to lie in a world of love as if a universe were spinning. My body seemed to be consumed by a whirlwind of pleasure which seemed to be moving at will towards my pleasure center. That my desire for love and sex was strong was strange, but it seemed to feel wonderful. The sensations from my breasts were rolling through my body, dancing with my nerves of erotic delight; in a swirl of love, passion, heat, wetness, heat and passion.</p> <p>The room seemed to go into a swirl of color as I stood there in the middle of my dream world. Our bodies were touching and dancing upon each others. My breasts were so large that they bounced with each movement of my body and seemed to bounce with my desire. My breasts had no nipples and I felt like they were as hard as pebbles, even as they swayed above them. I could feel my skin getting flushed with heated passion.</p> <p>My hips bucked up into my son's thrusts, my body was on fire and my mind was being shaken from wherever the passions took me. I could hardly see anymore, my head was swimming in a sea of erotic passion as I enjoyed every throb of a son and every moan and cry from my lover. My nipples were so hard that they were aching and aching with want. My nipples were so swollen that I can still feel them throbbing against my breasts. The world felt like it was rushing through my mind, becoming alive with pleasure as I danced above my mother's body. My hands caressed each other while my hips pumped back and forth into my lover. I felt the heat of lust rising from my loins, as if I had an endless supply of erotic pleasures to give.</p> <p>I wanted more, I wanted to feel him deep inside me. I wanted to cum hard, hard for my son's pleasure. I just wanted to feel his cum, explode into me. I wanted to let him make me cum, to feel his hot semen spill into me.</p> <p>"Oh, Mom," mumbled my son as I began to buck and writhe beneath his throbbing cock.</p> <p>"Shh," I moaned.</p> <p>My mind continued to buzz while I continued to dance, I looked down to where my son was thrusting into me. There were two of our bodies. His cock was deep and hard. My son's cock was thick and hard as it seemed so close to filling me. I felt like we were both in the throes of pleasure, both with love and passion, both trying to feel each the same. The feelings from my body were so different.</p> <p>"I love you mom," I moaned.</p> <p>It was the most ecstatic sound I had ever heard, like I had died and became a ghost.</p> <p>I continued to move my hips around my son's hardness, feeling the motion of him through the veins which were hard. I could feel as much pleasure as my body could and it seemed different from our bodies. It was like I was having an electric feeling of electricity coursing through us and was doing it so fast so fast that I was having no control over it. It seemed as if we were racing towards sexual ecstasy.</p> <p>"Oh, MOM, Oh, Mom, Oh, Mom," was my response to the love I was being given back to my body.</p> <p>And then I felt it. As I felt it moving in me, I could see my heart beating like mad. I could feel my heart beating against me as my body felt so hot and wet between us. Every single as my heart beat throb, with a heartbeat.</p> <p></p> <p>I wanted more, I felt as I wanted more, more, I felt I want to feel it more. I want moreâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
