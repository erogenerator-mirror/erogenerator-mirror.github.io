One Night</h4><p><strong>Never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in Soho, than one memorable evening when the Doctor and his daughter sat under the plane-tree</strong> in London, England.</p> <p>"You two look so happy," I said to them as he kissed me on the forehead, when he got into a lift with me. The lights came on and he and my mom made their way to the ground below.</p> <p>"You were right when you said you were glad to be back with us," his mom said.</p> <p>"So was mom," I said. "How's the job going?"</p> <p>"Work, son," dad said. "But I guess you knew we wouldn't be coming back here, didn't I?"</p> <p>"I had to give him a hand on the phone for that," I chuckled.</p> <p>"He's a big boy, you should see his eyes," my dad said laughing.</p> <p>"I don't know about that."</p> <p>It was only on the third day we got engaged that he took my virginity. After, it was two months later when he got me pregnant. I was his first. He promised to fuck me in my cunt whenever I needed it.</p> <p>"Yeah," I said, with a smile I never told anyone.</p> <p>It was a couple of months after they were engaged, when we went to my parents home after having dinner at my parents house. As I was taking off my blouse, I noticed he was looking at me.</p> <p>"You're wearing a strapless bra?" he said smiling.</p> <p>"Haha, yeah," I giggled.</p> <p>"I never knew you had so big breasts," he said, while cupping my breasts.</p> <p>After taking off my skirt, I took off his. It did not take but a few seconds. We had been to a few strip parades before we met a few of my other friends who wanted to fuck, as well as my ex husband. He was no stranger to the pleasure he gave me, even if my cock had been the first he had given me.</p> <p>"You know, my father said that we were forbidden to fuck since we are old," he said.</p> <p>I smiled and said a sweet nothings at him, before starting to take off my bra. I knew he would like seeing my tits as much as he liked seeing my pussy.</p> <p>"You had that beautiful blonde hair all over you too," he said as he held his hand over my pussy.</p> <p>"You've got great tits. I was lucky I got your first one the best," I said. "Is you going to fuck me tonight?"</p> <p>"Naw, don't worry about me," his dad laughed.</p> <p>"You're my mom and all my friend, if you weren't married, dad would probably think nothing of having sex with your mom," I said, looking at him with a wicked smile.</p> <p>"We're not going to do anything," he said, with his eyes. "We do plan on fucking each other tonight."</p> <p>He kissed me on the cheek and we walked to our hotel. Not wanting him to see my bra underneath my skirt, I slipped it off, before kissing him again.</p> <p>"You're so strong," I told him, while pushing him against the hotel room.</p> <p>"We are so strong," he growled, while ripping off his clothes.</p> <p>"I'm your mother," he said.</p> <p>"I'm the best," I laughed.</p> <p>"So are you."</p> <p>"So, the hot mom with the best friend?"</p> <p>He kissed me again. "I was about to cheat," I said.</p> <p>"I could never cheat on you if we don't have sex," he said, while kissing me.</p> <p>"Oh, you don't have to cheat on me, if we don't have sex."</p> <p>"I know that," he grinned.</p> <p>"Can we go to your bedroom?" I asked, while rubbing my hand over his crotch.</p> <p>"Nah, we have plenty of time to play," he said.</p> <p>We went to the hotel elevator with no further questions asked. The lights were off and I was naked by the time he opened the door.</p> <p>"I've never fucked anyone in a hotel before," I said.</p> <p>"Neither have you," he laughed, while pulling me into his arms.</p> <p>"So, it's okay?" I said, while feeling his lips on my stomach.</p> <p>"It's all right," he said, while kissing me again</p> <p>"What do you want to do?" I asked.</p> <p>"I want to fuck you again," he said. "But not tonight because I told you I didn't want to,"</p> <p></p> <p>"What do you want to,?" I asked</p> <p></p> <p>" to? want, I want?" I asked me," he said, with that you," he said I with a while kissing me going downâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
