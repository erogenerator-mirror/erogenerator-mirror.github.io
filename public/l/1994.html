Out of Plato. ’He then whose mind is endowed with true</h4><p><strong>magnanimity, who hath accustomed himself to the contemplation both of all times, and of all things in general; can this mortal life (thinkest thou) seem any great matter unto him?</strong></p> <p>I was on top of the world when I landed on the planet. I was very young, in good shape, and had some trouble getting the first time between my legs into the vagina. I had decided to practice this with a small cock as my 'last act of the day'. It took some effort, but eventually I got it in and it got good and hard. Yes, it made me feel good in other ways too.</p> <p>I thought about the good sex all my life; so much so that I did not really care for my own life too much. Just about every girl I knew wanted me to do the same thing to them.</p> <p>My first thought was that that there is no harm in fucking. After all, even though I wanted to have intercourse with my own body (and, I hoped to have many, many good experiences with mine), my main thought was that it is not only good that is good. We, the earth in all parts of it, are so vast, so diverse, and so varied in our experiences that there is not any possible alternative to having human bodies as one.</p> <p>Even in the absence of much action, my mind wandered (and I was in a state of sexual arousal). I could not decide whether I liked having sex with another woman. It seemed so strange but I just couldn't think of any reason why. There was really just so much to do. I thought about going back into the library, and reading some things on how to please myself. I was really fascinated with the way that human bodies seemed to be capable of responding. I felt really horny. My cock was almost fully erect, and it was feeling very different from before.</p> <p>I wanted to go back and see if I could get a hold of this, but there was nothing else. So, I just got up and walked back to the bathroom to get my own cock. I didn't really do a very good job of it but, as always, it felt good. I stroked it gently, running my finger tips over the head, then back to the end. I wanted it to feel good when I did it to myself. I wanted to give it a thrill.</p> <p>After a while I got bored of doing nothing and got back to writing on myself. I was not sure that I really liked anything else. Some parts were good, most of them boring and dirty. The one thing I really liked was the idea of having a penis in my mouth and down my throat.</p> <p>I think my best description was 'suck a cock'. Well I had read about this in Cosmo (which was really quite a cover). I got on my knees, and had my nose to the base of the penis, and got slowly started doing what I did best in the area of blowjobs. I wanted to give a blowjob before I had a dick.</p> <p>My first time was with a girl, who did not look at the world that much. And, I also could not really tell what a girl felt between her legs, let alone what she looked like in person. It was interesting, though, when I felt the first stirrings at my dick. I think that some of the girls enjoyed this, and if I felt like it, I too would like it.</p> <p>I think my first time was with women who looked somewhat different to how I looked. And, I did not get all of the girls that first time down on my penis. I did notice, though, that I thought of myself as much more attractive than most of that (or, in some instances, some of the girls).</p> <p>And I wanted a cock for my first experience to have great potential. To be fair, I did not really believe it; it could have seemed ridiculous and scary, but I had to admit to myself that I liked the feeling, and the whole thing seemed so exciting. The thing is, I like going down on a woman, I really like it if a cock feels pretty good.</p> <p>As my experience with women was starting to spread itself out and I was getting more confident about having a cock in my mouth, a cock felt so wrong. I got my dick out in front of me and took it in my hand before it too grew or hardened. I was surprised that it felt good. I had no idea it felt so good, and it felt quite nice. I loved the way the foreskin rolled back and forth over the head of my penis, and the way the foreskin pulled back even more, and the way the head of my dick would sort of pop off with each pull. It did feel nice, and it made me feel really good.</p> <p>So, I did what I had planned for the next day, I went to a gym, orgy. I thought of another day, and started doing what I wanted.</p> <p></p> <p>I was getting a little tired early, and went out and went to gym. I felt well—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
