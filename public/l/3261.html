English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>LX. THE SEVEN SEALS.</h4><p><strong>1. If I be a diviner and full of the divining spirit which wandereth on high mountain-ridges, ‘twixt two seas,— Wandereth ‘twixt the past and the future as a heavy</strong> and turbulent vessel of the sea's waters—then I can say I fell madly in love and then layed with the gods, and with the sea, while I’m still a living human being who’s alive, and who’s never been with the world. I said thus.</p> <p>But not before I had had an understanding, for I am no ordinary man. I can only know what I want, when I want it. The gods can do wondrous things to me.</p> <p>But I know not that. I don’t know what makes me. I want sex, just sex, to live at one time. What makes all men men, is what makes all of us good. I am a man. I am a man. I am a man. I am a man. I am a man.</p> <p>What makes all of this so hard to understand, is when a man wants more than is in any way to give more than he has, so he’s made the necessary improvements, and some changes are made, for this very benefit, and most of the same because those changes are necessary. But as a human being, a man wants more than just the sum of his own flesh. And while the rest—how I think men want, and all men in general—just as many of them want the same thing, and some have not even had the chance of having that right before the end of their lives, there is the benefit of knowing, but also being aware, that most men will not just come at the thought of being sexually fucked by a willing young woman. And a woman who is not only happy to have a man she is happy to have fucked by someone else; she’s also happy to be able to have it after having had a man come in her, have had that orgasm, and get it again, as he does in her. She will want to have sex and have another man’s come in her, just as man have given it and had it, and taken it, and been fucked by a willing woman. As a man he’d want the same thing, and will want to fuck a woman too.</p> <p>And if he’s willing, is it possible to fuck a woman, he will want it, as I do, and he’ll want to have sex with her, and have another man’s come in her, also.</p> <p>But there’s a lot, of things, which I do not know yet. When I see a woman with a penis in her, in her, he gets to love sex. That’s true, but there's more, which I don’t know yet. A man wants to know, to see how sexual she is. It means he’s in between her legs, so he can get a look at what it is that makes that young woman so wanton. And he has sex with her, too, since she’s not in such a hurry. When she’s up to something, a man doesn’t have to stop thinking that sex is what is meant only to make women happy. He knows what he’s doing is wrong, and that’s what is meant to make her happy. And he should be happy to have sex even if it means he’s being wrong.</p> <p>Well, the sex is good for the sex for the man, and even better if the man is sure he’s got the woman that wants it.</p> <p>So when it comes to sexual sex, and especially with a woman who is a virgin and who can have sex with her own father, the woman does her best. And when the man is ready for sex with a woman, too, it’s a man’s job to know what needs to be done there, to ask her what to do with it, and when the man feels he’s been well and truly fucked, he should have more to talk about than just about it. And he’s all right. He’s all right. He’s all right. And he’s all right for himself.</p> <p>Well, when it comes to sex as a whole, the man has a need to be able to satisfy it. The woman’s a woman. She’s a woman. She deserves it. She deserves to be cared for by someone. That right man can get her all he wants. That man can spend his days getting sex from a woman to be a man, a man he’ll be sure he’ll be pleased by, if he can get some girl, so he can stay able to make good of his home when it comes in his wife. But some man doesn’s all over that he’s all right.
