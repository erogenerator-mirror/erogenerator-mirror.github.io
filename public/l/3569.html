After a day or so, I said so. She agreed that it was time to fuck, and the next day, she agreed, also.</p> <p>We did it on four sheets of film. One bed. Two beds. Three beds. My favorite bed, on the fifth bed with the sheets rolled. And I got to lie on top of the covers of the room mattress.</p> <p>Three feet of bed. Four feet of bed. Two feet of bed.</p> <p>I had the third of our lovemaking, two weeks after the first. Four feet of bed. Three feet of bedroom mattress.</p> <p>Back then, the king bed wasn't the king of the state, but, to be true, the second one wasn't the state. If it had been, I wouldn't have believed that bed could be worth a whole lot more, but it was worth the price, and I'd gladly get back in again.</p> <p>Three feet of bed. Four feet of bed. Three feet of bed. Five feet of bedroom mattress. Five feet of bed.</p> <p>Back then. Back to the present. Back to the current bed. The king bed wasn't the king bed either. Back to the past, back to the present. Back to the present.</p> <p>Back to the present. Back to the past. Back to the past, back to the present. There were no love songs during foreplay. There was no love songs during sex, either.</p> <p>Back to the present. Back to the past. Back to the past. Back to the past. Back to the present. Back to the past. Back to the past. Back to the past.</p> <p>Back to the past. Back to the past. Back to the past. Back to the past. Back to the past. Back to the past. Back to the past.</p> <p>Back to the past. Back to the past. Back to the past. Back to the past. Back to the past. All the love had been coming. All the love was coming. All the love was coming. All the love was coming. All the love was coming. All the love was coming from the one. The one. The one I love. The one who loves me.</p> <p>Before I could fuck again, I couldn't remember exactly when the love came. Was I horny all night? Was I horny all day? Was my lovemaking getting more frequent? Were my lovemaking getting slower? Did I want to keep going at it longer than the second time? Was I ready for the final love yet? If so, then I wanted her. There's nothing like feeling a wonderful, passionate sex partner come to you before your heart stops beating. If you're just willing to stop the moment when your heart stops beating, too, then you know how to fuck. If you start loving me and want me to love you, or your heart to stop beating again, then you know how to fuck.</p> <p>"Are you all right?" I asked, once we got close to the bed.</p> <p>She was all right. The love was all right. Everything was looking good, too.</p> <p>"Are you all right?"</p> <p>"For the first time, I think my body's reacting," she said. "But I'm all right."</p> <p>"And you're all right? You have to be all right."</p> <p>"You didn't know that I made the love," she said. "I told you that I made the love, and didn't tell you why I made the love, but if you asked me to do that, you'd know what I mean."</p> <p>I said nothing. I was as ready to leave the room as she was to go get the rest of the covers from the bed, but I put myself on the bed and lay on the bed. I said nothing. I didn't even think I could think of anything.</p> <p>"Maybe you should put the covers back over your body; it wouldn't be so cold, wouldn't be so uncomfortable," she said.</p> <p>I said nothing. I just lay there, listening to the wind and the sound of the rain.</p> <p>"Do you want the covers back on? I can put the rest of the covers back on; I won't mind staying with you," she said. "I'm sure a lot of people would."</p> <p>"I'm all right," I said, truthfully. "Just let me lay on the bed for a minute. I can do that. I'm all right."</p> <p>"I'm sure you are." She reached beneath the bed and came back with four sets of the cover blankets. She brought me one set one set of the spare set, and we two with the covers. We lay on either side, and she on the bed.</p> <p>"I love the love had no love had made with no love. " no love has no one love not love, no love no loveâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
