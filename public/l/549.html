The elevator bell chimed, and Kysztina came out of her dreamlike reflection clad only in a silk blouse, stockings and heels, and no panties. She took off her skirt, and pulled down her panties, then sat down on the bed with a mischievous grin. Once on top of the duvet, she lay back, spread her legs, and beckoned for him to join her.</p> <p>“Here!” she said. When he reached her, he placed his lips on hers and kissed her. She was still wearing her stockings, and he could feel his erection rising in his slacks.</p> <p>“No, make love to me. Now!” she demanded, as she unbuttoned his shirt, slipping the fabric off his shoulders for him to lose. His shirt was thrown, and she leaned in to bite his nipples with her teeth, pulling the fleshy nubs hard into her fingers so that he moaned with pain as she stroked them. He pushed the waist of her skirt down, exposing her stocking clad thighs before he slid the black stocking down her calves and off. His hands took hold of her garter belt, and deftly slipped it off, tossing it to the side of the bed, before he ran his hands up from her belly-button, over her thighs, and along her sex.</p> <p>“Is this what you wanted?” she asked. “Is this what you’re going to give your baby girl?”</p> <p>“Uh, yes.”</p> <p>“Then make love to me, but don’t make it all the way inside.”</p> <p>“If you say so”.</p> <p>He rolled her onto her stomach, and as he laid down alongside her, he removed her high, black leather booty from the high-heeled boots she was wearing. Now they were both naked. He put his arms around her, pulled her tightly to him, and he pressed his erection into the cleavage between her breasts. They fell together to rest against her. She felt his hardness against her belly, and her nipples hardened instantly, making it difficult to move at all. She raised her head to meet his and kissed him, rubbing her lips and tongue along his lips, chin and face, while she ran her fingers in her hair.</p> <p>“I wanna suck on your lips, baby. I wanna kiss you everywhere”.</p> <p>Kysztina nodded and gave him a hungry smile. She knelt on the bed at his side, and took his penis in her mouth, sucking him down and then back again.</p> <p>“God, that’s good. Oh, yes, suck my cock, baby. Suck my cock!”.</p> <p>“Oh god, oh yes, yes,” she said at the same time. She kissed her way up his stomach, and he grabbed the back of her head and pressed her mouth down over the head of his penis. He felt her tongue licking around the shaft, sucking it into her mouth, sucking it up into her mouth, teasing it with the tip of her tongue in that delicate sensitive skin. He groaned as she worked his penis inside her mouth. He pressed her head forward, as she stroked the head with her tongue.</p> <p>“Take your time. Be a good girl.”</p> <p>She took him out of her mouth, rubbing her lips up his penis, up the underside to stroke him with her tongue, then down again. She reached between her legs and rubbed her vagina up and down the length of his erection, occasionally taking him all the way inside her. She pressed him back into the bed, and then slid down his body until she was between his legs, with her face inches from his penis. She looked up at him, her expression so seductive, her eyes aflame, licking her lips for him. Her mouth was closed, but he could see her pink tongue flickering out in a slow circle at his base.</p> <p>“What are you doing?” he exclaimed, in amazement of what was actually happening.</p> <p>Her pink tongue darted out at his erection, and she smiled broadly.</p> <p>“Nothing. It’s been ages since I made love.”</p> <p>They kissed again for a few moments, and she turned her back on him. Kysztina lifted herself off the bed to position herself above his penis. She could tell from the moment he touched her that he liked what she was doing to him, and wanting him to do her, that too. That, too. She felt his penis touch her, and felt their bodies touching and feeling, his penis and rubbing against her labialding her, moving closer and rubbing and feeling their bodies, as they touched and rubbing against. she—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
