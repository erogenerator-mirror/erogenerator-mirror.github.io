The havoc that months had previously wrought was now emulated by the</strong> rapid progress of its development in the art of sexual intercourse.</p> <p>“My God! My God. This is fantastic. What a change!” He said in a husky voice, feeling it enter his consciousness. He’d never felt as happy to see a girl in this way when he was in school, or even to be on a date. Never had he imagined this.</p> <p>He looked at his clock radio and noticed the time, already ten o’clock, and was amazed at what had happened in this last hour of the day. It had been such a long time since he’d had such a great day, and now was such a fantastic day. He couldn’t understand it. “How’re you feeling?” he heard the voice in his head say.</p> <p>”It is still fantastic. I’m so happy!”</p> <p>He listened to the voice as he felt himself hardening against his thigh, his eyes staring into the face of this beauty. This was going to be fun.</p> <p>They were still at 9:40, and after breakfast, they went back to her bedroom, where he took her out to the patio in the backyard, and they lay back on the pool, taking in a gentle coolness by the water. The breeze was warm, sending chills down his spine. There were no clothes on on the patio, so it felt as if they’d been naked all the time. In his dream, he felt her warm body against his. He felt their bodies rubbing up and down each other, the soft silk of his bikini barely making a dent in the smoothness of his skin, as they kissed, licked and sucked each other, and he felt himself growing even harder. He felt her hands on his sides, reaching up under his shirt, taking his nipples between her fingers, pinching them. He felt her tongue on his neck. ”I want you, I can’t wait to feel you inside me.” She whispered to him, kissing down his neck, biting there until her teeth were scraping his skin.</p> <p>He slid himself up to the edge of the pool, allowing her to come up over him. She was wet enough that the bottom of her hairless mound pressed up against his hard cock. They were looking each other in the eyes, their tongues entwined around each others mouths. She took his cock in her hands, stroking it and stroking him.</p> <p>“You are so hard,” she whispered into his ear before leaning down to suck on it, her soft pink tongue sliding over his head and down his shaft. ”Is that what you want,” she asked, stroking him up and down, licking up and down as she ran her tongue over him. He let out a moan of pleasure as he felt her tongue run up and down him.</p> <p>His hands were on her head, running his hands through her hair, gripping the sides of her face. “Yes!” He moaned once more as she kept him in her hands, then moved on to his nipples, sucking on them as he felt her lips enclose him, sucking him in, her tongue flicking in and out.</p> <p>He felt his balls boiling up to the surface as she suckled on him. “I want to feel you cum inside me,” she moaned into his ear before slipping her tongue into his ear, nibbling it like she could probably drive him crazy. He felt her finger pressing him into her, the wetness of her body against him, the heat of her arousal, and then a hand stroking him hard through her bikini as she felt himself throb and his cock swell. As she was stroking him and fingering him, she took his hand and slid it down her body, sliding her bikini off as he felt her. He ran his finger over her clit and she felt herself throbbing even harder, her hands still stroking him and he felt himself stiffen even more as he felt her hands pressing his fingers down, over his swollen cock, down to his balls, then back up again.</p> <p>His fingers felt as if they were being sucked on, as if she were using his fingers in her pussy, sliding her fingers back down over his balls, massaging his ass as she kissed his lips. She was whispering his name now to herself, while her hand continued to drive his fingers into her, faster and slicker, driving her closer and closer.</p> <p>She let her hands slide down to touch his shoulders, but then lifted his face to hers, kissing him. Her tongue slid straight down as she kissed down his ear then lowered her lips over his neck, slipping her lips, her teeth and in that sweet breath on his collarbone. Her lips.
