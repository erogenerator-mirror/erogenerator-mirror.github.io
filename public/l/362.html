The colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in Petersburg and that</strong> it had finally come to pass but in another time they had come to realise that they had been forgotten.</p> <p>It was all they could do to hang on through the whole speech the whole time. They were in the presence of a woman who was really lovely in her underwear. She had a smile on her features and a twinkle in her eye as she looked back at one of her guests. If only that were there were men's eyes staring at her. The colonel’s mouth was sealed shut, but the smile hadn’t left her lips until she could feel him. She couldn’t tell whether she was feeling the same things herself or not but the feeling was getting a little intense at the moment.</p> <p>The colonel’s mouth didn’t leave mine. She was holding on with her lips open but as the tension left her neck she let her lips close to the top of them. It was an exquisite feeling, such a perfect moment. As her mouth did its thing and she closed it to breathe she could feel the colonel move his feet around to meet her. The movement sent a bolt of electricity down her spine and into her vagina.</p> <p>The colonel’s lips left mine and she couldn’t remember if they had closed yet. Her mouth was full but the effect made her feel like she had been holding a small hand in front of her face at the last moment.</p> <p>Just as the colonel was looking at another man, she had forgotten that anyone existed that existed in history. Now she could feel herself slipping away before she would let another man inside her body.</p> <p>The colonel’s mouth went to the back of her neck. For the first time she didn’t feel fear. It didn’t seem like a physical barrier which she thought would be like a wall. Instead of fear it seemed to be a new and exciting sensation.</p> <p>The colonel’s lips and teeth moved on her neck. Her body shuddered. Her eyes opened wide at first but then closed again. The colonel’s mouth left her neck to explore its way down her chest. Her nipples were hard and ached a little. Her mind started to wander back to the last time she’d had a body-building contest. Maybe it was a match for a championship but even then she could still feel the sensations that the colonel was applying to them.</p> <p>Her nipples were like rocks, just like her clit, but it was harder as a man was caressing them that was the reason she’d been lost in the world. It wasn’t that she felt shy about the way that the colonel was touching her but she had never been so close to him again and her body was responding to his touch. In the past she’d had to do a lot of thinking about it, to make sure that she had what it took before her heart really stopped.</p> <p>The colonel’s tongue went to the right-hand side of her nipple. It was the closest to the right. It was so soft, gentle and delicate. The colonel wasn't exactly trying to suck on the nipple but in her case it was all she could do not to cry out. The colonel knew which nipple to do. Just as her second nipple received the same treatment the colonel went to her left. It was now just the two of them on the chair, on a table and even with the others. It didn’t take long at all for both of them. Then as they began caressing the other two, she started to realise that something was different.</p> <p>She wasn’t feeling scared. She was feeling sexy. As they continued their caresses she could feel a little thrill go through her body. There had been one time where she didn’t really feel that way but they’d obviously gone a little further.</p> <p>The colonel’s body felt different somehow. The colonel’s breasts had been firm and pert but had suddenly become much softer. Her nipples were now soft and very sensitive. She could tell that they were a little harder than at one point. She couldn’t think of a single difference that it hadn’t been a little hard with each passing moment.</p> <p>Suddenly she felt her panties being slipped down. She was surprised, she’d had the most wonderful and erotic time with a man but she hadn’t felt the same way. The colonel’s hand made the same move while her fingers held her panties as if they were the reins of an Indian horse.</p> <p>As her panties slid down a little it was very strange and very strange for both of them. The colonel’s hands were holding the panties and caressing her legs were different. As soon she felt a pair of hands caressing her upper body parts of the same body very different. With both hands the way and being different things that were almost the colonel—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
