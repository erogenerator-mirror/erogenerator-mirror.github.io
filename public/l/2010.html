Free from all compulsion in all cheerfulness and alacrity thou</h4><p><strong>mayst run out thy time, though men should exclaim against thee never so much, and the wild beasts should pull in sunder the poor members of thy pampered mass of</strong> loveliness. And so with the next two hours spent in his room he began to undress. Inevitable thoughts raced through his mind - did the sight of her ass really excite him? Did she really bend over all the way? He could see her breasts. Oh, yeah. Her breasts were even better than they had been when he had first seen them.</p> <p>As she slid the gown off from her body, and tossed it aside, so he could see, this was not one of those moments, when the woman of his dreams stood up and danced for him, not the dress which the men had seen her wearing yesterday. As he looked, at her naked form, he remembered the vision of her long and dark hair, the softness of her belly, and her smooth skin, so well tanned.</p> <p>He felt himself growing erect in his pants.</p> <p>She approached him to dance with him. She leaned into him so that he could feel her hot breath on his neck as she whispered words of passion.</p> <p>"Would you like me to do it for thee? Would ya want to take me to the bed and fuck me now?"</p> <p>It didn't really matter that he had never even kissed a woman before, now that she was making love to him. All that was important to him was the pleasure he could get from this woman who he so greatly desired.</p> <p>She leaned back and moved closer to him. Her breasts swayed before him, her nipples hard and erect as they pressed against the silk of the gown. He took one of her nipples in his mouth and pulled on it, feeling its texture.</p> <p>"Aye, I want thee," she said and slid her hands over his waist.</p> <p>She leaned down and he felt his trousers come off as she slid them down his legs to his feet. When he stepped out of them and kicked them out of the way onto the floor, she stepped up behind him and slid her hands down to the front of his boxer shorts. A shiver went though him as she pressed her hips against his, pressed his cock up against her ass, and pressed her pussy firmly against his balls, and moved herself round so she could reach behind her and free his cock from his boxers while continuing to move her hips. He felt his cock become harder by the second as her fingers tightened around the shaft, and he wondered if she was thinking about him as he moved in circles around her clit. He thought he could feel her juices in her pussy as she pressed against him.</p> <p>When he realized she was still behind him she moved a little closer to him and pulled her hands up over his breasts so they were just level with his mouth, her fingers continuing to stroke his cock. "Aye?" she whispered a little louder.</p> <p>"I want thee, too," he said, but she looked a little surprised that he was willing to talk to another woman. "I don't know whether it's right, but I've always wanted to..."</p> <p>"You'd just have to ask." Her fingers slipped to the front of his shorts and tugged them and his boxers down so he could stand before her, naked as she stood with his prick pointing straight out at her ass. She looked over her shoulder at him from a few feet back.</p> <p>"Please," she said. "You're bigger than..." She moved back a little, pressing her tits against his chest and her face to his. Their lips met and he could feel her tongue pressing against his lips as she slid her arms around him and took his face in her hands. She put her lips to his ear, and said:</p> <p>"Aye, I do. I do."</p> <p>"Can I ask you something, Lestisierra?" he asked. "Aye, of course. I would like to know about ye...what you want me to do? I mean, what is it? What would ye like me to do?"</p> <p>Her hand was still working his cock, and her lips were still toying with his ear as she leaned back. "Oh, you know, I was wondering...would ye want me to do that? Wouldn't you just want me to suck you? Wouldn't you make love to me, with my mouth over you? Would you like me to put me to work with my mouth...? Would you want it to be as good as, what ye are?"</p> <p>He was surprised at how much he wanted to answer her, but then she put her arms around him and took his hands in hers, and pulled him off the settee and onto the settee beside her. She went straight to his cock in her hand and began to slide it into her mouth, moving both hands round and taking his balls, tugging the hairs while she sucked him up against his cock-side, until it was completely inserted into her mouth. She held him, and then as she sucked him again and he heldâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
