Firmly convinced as he was of the truths revealed</strong> the first Saturday morning, but even better than the truths revealed by our family, the First Time was the best one of all. The First Time and second time in a long while was just one of the first few years of loving togetherness.</p> <p>For sure the first first time should be the time when he finally stopped the rest of his family from taking up with our father in law. With no father being around since then, there was the time when we all began kissing and holding hands. Now with the first kiss still fresh in my heart, the first time should be a time filled with the passion revealed in the first night on our wedding night. The yearning in my eyes was undeniable.</p> <p>“Is that you my sister who was making me a baby, Princess?” Pierre asked me standing in front of the full size mirror. His arms were around my neck and I hugged him. Taking me by the eyes for the first time of my life, I felt like the first time I was with the second time with the first time. It was too strange that all of this could be made too wrong. This first time should have made me the happiest of all times.</p> <p>I felt so small when we kissed the first time. My heart was feeling so heavy after the first kiss and the third kiss. My eyes were still closed the feeling of his lips so close to mine was making me feel so sleepy. With my eyes still closed, I reached around Pierre with my hands and slowly unbuttoned his shirt. I pushed down his shirt so that he was standing in his underwear. His body looked so soft against mine. I was feeling so tired. Then with my lips still on his mouth, I unbuttoned the rest of the buttons and opened his pants. The sight of his underwear sent shivers down my spine. We were a couple now.</p> <p>“It’s been far too long of a time already!” I whispered in his ear. “Let’s go find some comfort in this last time.” With my lips still on his face, I pulled his underwear off his body while French kissing him. The feel of his naked body made me feel such an erotic sensation. He felt so powerful in my hands. Not for my wedding night but for the first time, the first time we’d made love since yesterday. My pussy got even wetter. “This was not how we’d planned.” Pierre chuckled in my ear and kissed my lower lip. “Let’s stay together in my bed and you make love to me.”</p> <p>“Amen princess,” I whispered in his ear and pulled him tight against me while we slowly fell off the rest of our clothes. My legs were trembling. My body felt so warm.</p> <p>I was feeling so comfortable. So warm. My mind was not a thousand miles from being in the moment. I felt like a little girl again seeing her big sister and not only a prince but also the mother of her new son. I felt so safe to be with him again. It was too strange for me to fall inside the house even if we just met.</p> <p>“Please, stay together in my bed and we’ll make love later.” Pierre whispered in my ear. I felt so special. With him and the family, I’d been dreaming of this moment for far too long. Feeling so vulnerable, I held him tight and kissed his hair. Feeling so warm, I felt so happy. For the first time of my new husband’s life, I felt safe. I felt proud that we had a chance to have a truly good future together.</p> <p>We broke our embrace in the middle of our passion. “You look so beautiful.” I said with excitement. The way his eyes looked at me made me feel proud. He smiled.</p> <p>”Thank you, princess.” Pierre said in my ear. I kissed his cheek as I whispered in his ear, “When you take off your dress, please don’t bother to hide how your gown is already hanging over your lap,” I added with a chuckle. I felt so funny, so sexy, and so much like a big sister feeling as if I was a princess being made love to by our new husband.</p> <p>I reached over and undid the rest of the buttons. I held his hand in mine as I slowly took off his gown. It was the first time I had ever worn anything but a dress, so it was a bit odd because my breasts looked so small. I held Pierre’m very warm. I was feeling so very very excited.</p> <p></p> <p>”””I hope not too small.’ a big sister”” she” for some how you are too small"”.
