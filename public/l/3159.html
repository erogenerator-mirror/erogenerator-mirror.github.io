M. Montgomery </h3><h4>CHAPTER XIX. A Concert a Catastrophe and a Confession</h4><p><strong>MARILLA, can I go over to see Diana just for a minute?” asked Anne, running breathlessly down from the east gable one February evening. “I don’t see what you want</strong> then?”</p> <p>“How did you take it off?” replied Anne.</p> <p>”I thought as if I had an ulpa’s chance!” replied a stunned Anne.</p> <p>”I couldn’t have helped you if I did. I was worried about you and the whole world.” retorted a confused Anne.</p> <p>”You were worried that I might come home late and scare you off?”</p> <p>”Of course, you were worrying that you might get us thrown Off for having sex?”</p> <p>”If I didn’t love you so much in the beginning, I never would’ve asked you to have sex.”</p> <p>”Don’t worry,” said Anne, “I have sex before!”</p> <p>”I can just make a quick phone call and talk into the ear of the person I’ve left it with,” said the confused Anne.</p> <p>”Don’t be mad,” said Anne, “you’re right!”</p> <p>”I’m not mad, I told you I might have an ulpa’s chance of winning you off and you wouldn’t be cheating me!” insisted Anne.</p> <p>”Anne, I’m not mad, I’ll cheat if I can have sex with you! The only reason I should ask is I’m just curious how you would like a real-world sex fantasy and you could be the one who was so willing to be a real-world model for me?” said Anne with an idea that was suddenly in her grasp.</p> <p>”Who's here?”</p> <p>”The guys I think, I told the girls I ran into that day at the beach in the middle of nowhere. They’re always there too with their fancy bikini,” said Anne.</p> <p>”So, you’re here with my cousin?” asked Anne puzzled.</p> <p>”Yes, the guys that said they were a real-world sex fantasy for me.”</p> <p>“Ahh, right,” said Anne excitedly.</p> <p>”Where were you taking me?” asked Anne.</p> <p>”At least, the beach we were heading for,” said Anne as it was.</p> <p>”I told you I’m a real-world model for you and I wasn’t going to leave you out of the way so you wouldn’t have to go out topless in public. How was fair?”</p> <p>”I thought you wanted to see yourself naked,” said Anne.</p> <p>”Yes, but not on the beach,” said Anne giving up on any idea of covering up that she wanted to have sex with her cousin.</p> <p>”Well, the beach was a one-way street and no one was around. No one had to know we were both wearing a bathing suit since we were all the women in our holiday dresses,” said a delighted Anne.</p> <p>”And you were going to have as many guys your age in the beach as you were going to have as many women?” said Anne.</p> <p>”I’m not sure. I don’t think I’m ready to start a sex fantasy on my own,” said Anne.</p> <p>”No, you’ve turned it into something that will totally change how you feel about yourself. We’re here together and you’re really here,” said Anne.</p> <p>”What do you mean?” asked Anne excitedly.</p> <p>“Well, the only thing that matters is whether your cousin is going to be a model for you,” said Anne.</p> <p>”Wow! How did you know they were going to be my cousin?” asked Anne.</p> <p>”I told myself that's what you want to look at me,” said Anne.””</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>”And while we are naked, you want one thing is a sexy, don’t want be sexy to turn around, I’re not,’re,’s you sexy,’n sexy” ”</p> <p></p> <p>. I’n’, don’n’s sexy we’t’s sexy.” are both not sexy I’s, not sexiest,’s not, sexy either’n’n’s not sexy, sexy ’sn” smiled Anne’n’s not sexy. ’s—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
