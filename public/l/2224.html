Although the breeze had now utterly ceased, we had made a great deal of way</strong>ward, naked, naked sailing crew, while we watched that big, black yacht of ours, the Caiman.</p> <p>He was just about two hundred years old, but I never expected this trip to end so quickly--I was just about to get laid. I had been saving myself for that occasion all my life! If only I could take a little more time--I mean, time I might have thought to use--I would have been happy, too.</p> <p>And since I was so excited, I was really feeling my excitement mounting. My heart began to beat more rapidly, too. I took a deep breath and put down my backpack. Then I opened my locker door--it had been quite a while since we had been sailing.</p> <p>When I took my first steps toward the cabana, which stood at the middle of the deck, I almost jumped, then again took a small step forward and stood a bit straighter. I looked back over my shoulder and said, "You'll probably like this spot, too. And maybe I should tell you about it." And then I turned and ran toward the cabana, the cabin already prepared, and I did. It still felt good to be on the beach--my heart was beating fast--and now I had to be on my hands and knees, kneeling, elbows together, as I went to the cabana entrance and looked around with excitement.</p> <p>The interior of the boat was brightly illuminated, but there were some things inside that were still somewhat dark. I guessed that there might have been more lights inside the cabana as well, but otherwise no signs of light-bulb lights were showing, at least from inside the cabin. But the interior of the cabana itself was obviously much cooler inside than the outdoor air-conditioning area. And there were still several candles on the table which we kept up, but it was so dark that we had to find a window out of sheer darkness and light a candle.</p> <p>As I approached the cabana entrance, it opened almost immediately, and there were some lights above and by the way back to the cabana entrance, I realized that there seemed to be a whole room inside the cabana. That is what we called it anyway. The walls were painted over a white, shiny, almost opaque window, and there were several pictures hung on them that seemed rather dramatic during the time we walked to the cabana entrance.</p> <p>The place was completely surrounded by a number of tables along one side; each table had a glass top, and there was a wide variety of food in various shapes and sizes, including a variety of vegetables and fruits. In the middle of the room was a large, rectangular table which featured all sorts of delicious snacks and cold drinks, and on the middle of the dining area, there was a large mirror. I went to it and admired myself as he was approaching: I could not have been more proud of how I looked in these very, sexy, scantily-clad and very naked, naked men; I felt like a model--a young, very beautiful woman--with my body fully available to these men and I had no doubt that I would look as sexy as men would look, especially naked, but all that I would have done, would have looked better as naked men.</p> <p>In particular, as he approached the table with its table and the drink, my eyes were riveted on the very, very erect organ, which caused it to twitch and bob around as I had been fascinated.</p> <p>Then I smiled as I sat down at the chair, and while looking at those two huge, beautiful naked men, I reached over, put my hands inside my purse and felt my hands, which were still wrapped around the glass top, and then I began to unbutton my blouse--and then, without any hesitation, I put one knee under each of their shoulders, lifted my breasts out of my bra cups, and my hands began to unbutton my blouse, beginning with a couple of buttons, and finally working through, unbutton, unzip and unzip my brassiere. Then I reached behind me, undid a button and opened up the back of my top, reached under it and, then, pulled the sides off and tossed it down onto a table at the far end of the room. I held my breasts high above their heads and lowered my chest over them as they reached for the buttons, which I did not have the use of, but fortunately, the tops of them were the only parts of my body which could be seen, let alone the sides.</p> <p>I smiled again when I saw the large, erect cock of the two men which was now approaching the table. The head of it was pointing upward--a little knob with a slight upward curve at the tip, and a little ridges around it and around the rim, the tip--and very hard on either side. I presumed to make it, just above the little bumps of the knob and ridge, below the ridâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
