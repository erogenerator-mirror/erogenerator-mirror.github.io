He loved how she moaned when his thumb touched her clit. And he loved how her ass tightened when his thumb grazed the small bud, he loved how long and thick her pussy lips spread when his thumb touched them. And he loved how her pussy clenched when his thumb slid into her moistening hole with the rest of his thumb.</p> <p>“I’d like to make love tonight Monsieur.” He paused in the act of pulling his thumb and thumb out the tip. “But it will depend, I want to do something with you first and it won’t take you long before I am ready.”</p> <p>“How about it, Monseigneur?”</p> <p>“I would love to take you up on that offer,” he said with a smile that said both love and admiration. “But is it safe to ask?”</p> <p>And with that she pulled his chin to bring his mouth to hers. They shared a passionate kiss that lasted for over a minute. Her tongue probed at his lips, then slid into his mouth. As her soft and long tongue danced in his mouth, she rubbed his erection against her mound. They began to laugh.</p> <p>“I’m a bit impatient, Monsieur. Can we take this to the bedroom first?”</p> <p>Once they were at the bed, she removed Monseigneur’s clothing. They made love standing up so they could fondle each other. It took them two minutes to be naked. Monseigneur was as strong as he was tall, as strong as he was strong. Their bodies were tight fit. Their cocks stiffened as if caught in a spell of iron, and began to throb a little like they had done in the shower earlier when they had just finished. They fell back on the bed, the pillow between their shoulders.</p> <p>Monseigneur, taking hold of her slender waist, leaned over to kiss her again. When they broke their kiss, so he could kiss around the small of her neck. His fingers slid into the looseness of her hair. Monseigneur continued kissing the small of her throat.</p> <p>After a short while of kissing, Monseigneur slid his hand down from her waist. He took his time caressing her chest. With every downward motion, he traced the skin of her breasts until his fingers were sliding under the skin and slowly across her nipples. He loved the feeling of her nipples in his hand, the hardness of her little tits. He loved the look of her as they lay there, lying there in the bed, naked and happy. She seemed to want his touch all the time.</p> <p>Before she knew what happened, he moved down between her legs, and placed both hands on her knees. With his thumbs, he began to move them slowly back and forth between her legs. He felt her tense against him. It was going to happen at once, he knew it was going to. He would make her cum. He had no intention of lasting more than a few seconds. Instead, he would make her cum. He wanted that too. He wanted to feel the waves of pleasure as her body became one with his mouth. So he would bring her pleasure.</p> <p>“I love you Monsieur,” she said between her breaths, “Oh my God, I’d like that.”</p> <p>She felt his hands slide down inside her leg to the knee, then move up onto her thigh. They did nothing but touch each other. But he found she really liked his touch on her. She knew he did it because he was a good kisser that would give her as much pleasure as she could take it and also feel pleasure that he could take. His mouth trailed her skin, his tongue sliding along the edges of her thigh, and ending at her pussy. At the same time his thumb slid into Monseignur, he found her clit sticking out. He began to move his thumb in and out of her pussy with each stroke. Monseigneur also loved to have her aroused so that she could feel the pleasure of fucking him. He loved to watch the pleasure of her body as it moved toward that pleasure but without quite the fullness of the desire to it. Monse being felt. It as the intensity of the intensity of her vagina. Of his thumb in her pussy.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>As Monse turned on, she felt his thumb moved, he moved on, she wanted more than—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
