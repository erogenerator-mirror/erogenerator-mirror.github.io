Holmes could talk exceedingly well when he chose, and that night he did choose. He appeared to be in a state of nervous exaltation.</strong> He hadn't had sex like this in years—not since his college days. And now he felt his manhood rising to the occasion. And he was really going to fuck this angel.</p> <p>"I want to fuck you!"</p> <p>"Yes, please!"</p> <p>"Oh god, yes!"</p> <p>"I've never fucked anyone as big as you! And we can do it all day, or all night."</p> <p>He kissed her so hungrily that, all but the very tip of his cock would slip up into her belly. He wanted it, so much that he almost came as soon as he touched the bare skin of her throat. He'd always wanted to have her neck, her ears, and then her face. It felt so good when he could see her face and her jaw, but now—</p> <p>"I want to fuck you! I want all over you!"</p> <p>He did feel a hand on his thigh, and it was coming up with the zipper of his jeans.</p> <p>"We don't have time," she said. "We're finished here."</p> <p>"The first man on earth that I want to fuck, and I want it so badly. Do you know what I meant?" He nodded.</p> <p>"No, the first time—"</p> <p>"I thought it wasn't enough. We'll have to have a lot more."</p> <p>"No. I want all of you, all the cock and the fucking."</p> <p>"No. We can wait. I'll fuck you," he said, with a smirk. "But right now I think it's time you got me off, big girl."</p> <p>He'd just gotten his cock inside her when the front door opened. It was not his house, and there was a large crowd. A lot of people had gathered in the living room to watch the show. Only a handful were in the family room, and the rest were still in other parts of the house. One woman sat by an old, black recliner, who had her skirt hiked up around her waist when she lay back onto the seat. This was going to be something new for Mary Claire.</p> <p>"Who is it?" the man at the foot of the stairs asked.</p> <p>"This," Mary Claire replied, standing up.</p> <p>"We're in good company. Are you two going to fuck?"</p> <p>"Yes. I want to fuck, too. I want to share you with the world."</p> <p>"I want to fuck you some more," the woman in the recliner moaned.</p> <p>"We need to wait."</p> <p>The crowd parted, and, with Mary Claire standing at the head of the stairway, Holmes went straight to the man standing by the bed. His erection had already grown to a full erection, and it bobbled before him in front of his face. The man's cock was thick, too, and it was curved almost precisely at the end. His cock, which had been semi-flaccid, was a nice size—around eight inches long, and he had only gotten hard around the size of Mary's finger.</p> <p>"That's right, baby," the man said, watching Mary Claire's hands come up on the man's chest and squeeze his nipples. "This is your lucky day."</p> <p>Mary Claire dropped to her knees, and, unbuckling his pants, pulled them down. The man stepped out of them, and she took off his socks as well as his belt. When she put his shoes back on, she slid his pants down past his ankles and tossed them aside.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me. Now!" she said, and she was right on her knees before the man. It was more impressive than a blowjob, but somehow it was still a step too far to go with a hot, young pussy on her knees, but it was nice. And there was good sex to be had there, too.</p> <p>This was her moment. The idea that she could make love with a bunch of men, just a few minutes before one of them fucked her, made her feel wonderful—so sexy and satisfying, but just so strange.</p> <p>"Take me," she said. "Take me from behind. That's what I like to do."</p> <p>That was a difficult task, for a guy who was in high school. It was her turn to be nervous, and, with him already in position, she had no trouble doing whatever was necessary for him to get inside her. She leaned forward, and she felt one of his big hands grip her ass.</p> <p>"Yes," she gasped. "Just like that."</p> <p>It was a new and thrilling thrill—one she hadn't quite felt before but now knew and she wanted, and never experienced.</p> <p></p> <p>"Oh, she gasped, she said, he said—yes, she said, he came—what she said he said—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
