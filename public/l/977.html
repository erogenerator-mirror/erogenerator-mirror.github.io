On the 18th of June the moon was full. Its light favored Blücher’s ferocious pursuit, betrayed the traces</strong> of Earth, the Sun, and moon upon a distant planet. And still our moon is alive beyond its limitations. I, in turn, bore a special homage to the moon itself in its ancient form as part of its grand, grand beauty. A celestial and historic celebration of our moon.</p> <p>This was the day the moon would be full again...</p> <p>For a while.</p> <p>For a long while.</p> <p>We, the moon's parents, lived and breathed the lunar life...</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>It was in the early summer of 1960 that I first noticed something. Some of Mother Nature's elements were stirring in my brain, a mixture of things, but different as well. All were stirring with life and vitality, like the tides of a sea of the universe. But in the midst of those currents was a sea of the universe, a sea of the people, a sea of the ocean and the sky, and those waves. In that sea the moon was the only living thing. Yet, in the midst of this sea was a man, a boy, who is so happy to be alive that he feels joyous and complete at the same time, because he is the only one to ever truly be happy to be on this earth.</p> <p>And, even from a distance, I could see the glow of life. It radiated from the moon.</p> <p>It was a day like any other: the night and the moon shining on the planet itself. The moon was full and bright. The stars were bright and shining at the same time. The sun was set in the sky like a beacon for a person to follow.</p> <p>On that day I saw a single point of light that reflected in the sun and glowed in its light.</p> <p>It was a day of freedom.</p> <p>There was so much fun and enjoyment in life. The moon was alive! It was alive! It was alive!</p> <p>It really was alive!</p> <p>On that day I knew that I had fallen in love with someone else. A beautiful woman whose face was beautiful and sexy and whom I met on lonely days as well. Our names would float in and out of my mind. I loved her, and our love made life so much more. And there was only life in those moments of joy.</p> <p>We met on a beach in the middle of the night as a beautiful sunset. I gazed at the moon as it glowed in the sky and the sun shone on the waves. We drank beer and laughed when she came back from where she had fallen asleep on her back, her eyes closed.</p> <p>I gazed at her breasts; her nipples were dark and round and were erect. I touched, played with, kissed, sucked, and licked her nipples, but first, I felt her pussy. I fingered and licked her pussy, but her clit was waiting for attention. I stroked and sucked, stroked her clit with my tongue, and stroked her pussy with my tongue. We were lost in our lovemaking, which made us so many years apart that the time, not every second, is a thousand and ten seconds or hours.</p> <p>I sucked and licked her clit and fingered her pussy as I ate her out. Her pussy juices were flowing as my mouth sucked and licked with her desire like I was the first of the world to ever experience it.</p> <p>Then I stopped.</p> <p>I turned to her. She looked me in the eyes and smiled.</p> <p>"What's so funny?" she asked.</p> <p>"I love you," I said.</p> <p>She smiled. "Really?"</p> <p>I nodded. "Yes," I said. "I love you."</p> <p>We were still sitting on the beach. I was naked. She was completely nude. She smiled and brushed her hair.</p> <p>"I love you," she said. "Always," she said.</p> <p>"You're such a beautiful creature," I said. "And so beautiful. It's the best day of my life," I said.</p> <p>"I'm so happy. So am I."</p> <p>She took my right hand and kissed it. "So am I."</p> <p>It was a short kiss. She said again.</p> <p>"Will you come back tomorrow?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes," I said, "there will be no more visits--only to come back for the other one tomorrow."</p> <p>"Good, good!" she said. "You will come to see me again, right?"</p> <p>I gave her my heart. I was such joy. I loved and loved her; she was the love of my life. I so loved. a human. I was. and my own child's life. I was. the true love. We were, always love of love.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"You're you can—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
