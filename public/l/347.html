He was a very handsome young man, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features. Everything</strong> he lacked in build was in good shape, with long, straight black hair down to his beautiful, broad shoulders; and his smile was absolutely dazzling.</p> <p>I knew when my wife slipped on our wedding reception dress that we would have a grand time. He took me out to an expensive restaurant and enjoyed some really special lobster and vegetables and a couple of steaks—and he paid extra to keep the restaurant a special place for our honeymoon day. I was happy to share our time, but now that our wedding night was over I dreaded the day when we would be alone and I would have some serious trouble in bed.</p> <p>We didn't have to wait long.</p> <p>For the first time in my life I was having sex. I'd been doing it for years. Now, with the promise of a real, live, live-in man, I was getting my first real cock in bed! I didn't hesitate. Within a few minutes I was fucking like a shameless slut. His hands were all over me. He was pinching my nipples. And I loved it! My cunt was wet and aching. Everything was just right in the world. He kissed me and played with my breasts and, I couldn't believe what we were doing—my nipples were throbbing and I was sopping wet.</p> <p>"You'll never guess what Daddy was thinking just then...about your father," he said.</p> <p>He was right. I remembered what he'd said about my breasts being his only source of comfort. It made me think even more of my first time. I had to ask, "How was it with father?"</p> <p>"It was great!" he said, "I can't tell you the kind of man that you are!"</p> <p>My first orgasm was so powerful. I hadn't expected another man's cock. When he pumped it into me the first time, I knew I liked it, enjoyed it, even though it didn't bring much variety and it wasn't so big that I couldn't fit it into me. He didn't try any other way. Nor had he tried licking me there too. He knew what to do. After I had climaxed he turned me over on my knees and pulled me by my shoulders to my feet and, lifting me onto him, thrust his cock into me.</p> <p>"That's a big cock Daddy!" I moaned, "I love it!"</p> <p>We'd discussed all kinds of things. He'd wanted a threesome with two women and a man, although we couldn't get in an arrangement that worked, so I got fucked and, when he climaxed in me, he was satisfied.</p> <p>I'd never told him how much I enjoyed having a real man come inside me. I'd never told him that I wouldn't cum without his cock, that I liked it when I came when I had a real dick. I loved having the man I was marrying so we could be together every day.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful," I said.</p> <p>"Gosh, you're so beautiful too, honey," he said.</p> <p>And he was right. I loved the feeling of power I felt as I made love to my father the next day. It was such a revelation. I realized that I wanted to be the first woman to do him in a bed. It was a big step. I wanted it to be my first time.</p> <p>*****—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
