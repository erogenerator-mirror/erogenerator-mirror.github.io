For a Covenant, if lawfull, binds in the sight of God, without the Oath, as much as with it;</strong> as it, that is, in the sight of my Lord and Lord of the Earth.</p> <p>That was the thought going through my head. I was getting turned on by the idea.</p> <p>The Lord of the Earth was an attractive man. I was attracted to him as if it were my life's blood on this Earth.</p> <p>We were walking on a lovely summer day when a breeze rustled my hair and the thought of what was about to occur flashed through my head.</p> <p>My thoughts ran wild. Would this day turn out to be so?</p> <p>We were on our way to the island of Kauaka as beautiful white-clad people rushed to get into their boats. I had been hoping that a good day might come.</p> <p>The sky was still cloudless like a beautiful afternoon. Only in the winter was there so cloudy. The sun looked like an inviting cloud. I don't think I had ever been on one. That's the same way I always said I thought it could be so hot to go in the cool of the evening, so warm and sunny and romantic and like the rest of the world.</p> <p>Our boat had been pulled off the pier and we were in the cove for about two hours before it disappeared and the beach had turned into a sea of blue blue-green. I was feeling excited. I couldn't help it.</p> <p>I hadn't been on the beach for years.</p> <p>Then I remembered the dream I'd had, about going to paradise and being married. My cock would wake up any second. Then maybe my dreams would always come true.</p> <p>My body reacted to the sight of my friends in their swimming bikinis. Maybe when they saw me, the dream went away. But the reality wasn't exactly as pleasant. It had always been a mystery to me. I remembered the first time I had an opportunity to spend time with a nice man my age. To do that was just wrong.</p> <p>But that was what happened today. Now I had to have his cock in my mouth and I was so excited to say the least it just made me feel cheap for doing it. My cock, as if at the beginning of a long, slow journey into my body, sprang to life again.</p> <p>Suddenly the idea of sucking a dick made my mouth water. I had always dreamed of doing it. My first time on the beach. But I didn't have the courage to bring it reality.</p> <p>I hadn't known the idea of having a dick in my mouth to be so taboo. I had always been afraid that any one would find out. But I had found my chance to do this. I really liked it.</p> <p>I was getting so worked up from thinking about it that when the water hit my face I opened my mouth to say my piece. But in that act only a part of me was aware. All others would have thought I was putting on a show. I took the first two inches, looked at the mirror on the wall and blew on it, not looking right at me.</p> <p>The image I saw in the mirror was of the man I sucked off on the beach, not a little girl. He was a beautiful man, very athletic and in good physical shape for his age but I never had noticed how much my cock was stirring in my shorts.</p> <p>After a few seconds I felt as if I had done a good thing. I really did enjoy what I was staring at. I wanted to make him want me again - and probably do that for hours. That would be the reason why I wanted him even more. Perhaps it would make me feel cheap to be gay, but I didn't have to be.</p> <p>I really enjoyed what I was seeing and doing. It felt so naughty to be staring at another man's dick.</p> <p>I wanted to taste it. To smell it and to feel it between my lips, to feel it hard inside my body as he fucked me, and I hoped there would be no sperm left to waste.</p> <p>I put the tip to my mouth and slowly drew it into my mouth and started to suck. Suddenly I felt it harden. I could feel it in my jaw. Was he really as big as I thought it would be? How long had it been growing in my mouth?</p> <p>I wondered if there were a lot of dicks in this world bigger than mine.</p> <p>I liked the feel and the taste of it. There was something about a man's dick that made me wet. I had dreamed about sucking cock and I had imagined sucking the one whose precum was already oozing out my nose.</p> <p>I had fantasised about fucking it.</p> <p>Now I had to do it. to satisfy the desire in every part of me. like I did I want to have him. He wanted to feel like how my first. that hardening cock of his in my heartbe my lips. not feel on mine. I could give the cockâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
