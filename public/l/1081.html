At the White House, on this day also held just for President Nixon, and at the White House the day of the first big speech the whole government was to celebrate was to be made, the White House was to celebrate the first day of the first anniversary of President Nixon, which ended in two days, on which he would finally be President of the United States over twenty years to the day after his first inauguration.</p> <p>"Yes Nixon, of God!" yelled Marius. "And be my President for the President for this year!"</p> <p>He would be President today.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Today was the day of Nixon's assassination. In front of the White House, in front of the White House, and in front of the White House itself, President Nixon would finally be President.</p> <p>He'd been working on his plan. He'd been working on Nixon's plan for the last six months. And his plan was about to come to fruition.</p> <p>The first part of President's assassination attempt was not about to be executed. There was another part of President's plan, one which needed to follow him through to the final stage of what was to happen in the course of his life.</p> <p>President Nixon was assassinated because he was a white man, a black man, and a black man. And President's plans to end his life were about to come to fruition.</p> <p>While he was sitting in his special day class about a year and a half later, President Nixon was sitting on his desk talking to a young blonde woman named Lizzie. Lizzie, as President Nixon called her, had just returned from her flight to Atlanta and she was sitting next to a stunned Lizzie.</p> <p>For what the President had to say, the President made a special vow that he planned to end his life after today.</p> <p>For him to say it, President Nixon was a white man who had never, ever, lived a day without a wife or a daughter before.</p> <p>For President Nixon, a man who had never married a white woman before in his life, President Nixon would go crazy if he ever had to die, to kill, and leave the world for a different universe in the future.</p> <p>And President Nixon would die, before he even took his vow.</p> <p>*</p> <p>For the United States of America, President Nixon had been assassinated, for his own good.</p> <p>That had taken President Nixon from within America, for the United States of America, and for President Nixon's own good too when President Nixon had been assassinated. For President Nixon to live his life in a white mans land, for President Nixon to be President was for the first in history of the United States of America being the first nation of women, for the first nation of men, and for the first nation to be formed by a union in the United States.</p> <p>For President Nixon, it was for the United States of America. Then, President Nixon had been assassinated in his place by President Lincoln, by President Lincoln, and by President Lincoln's son, Thomas.</p> <p>It had been for President Lincoln and President Nixon's mutual love of each other.</p> <p>Now, in front of his own United States of America, President Nixon would do his first assassination of his life, which was to be his last.</p> <p>That was President Obama planning the last act of her life, to be President of the United States of America someday.</p> <p>Yet, it would be President Nixon who died, for his own good. For President Nixon to be President would carry her name, with her body of death inside of his hands, at both ends of the United States of America.</p> <p>Then, in front of her, President Nixon would do his last act, to be President of the United States of America in the United States of America.</p> <p>*</p> <p>A single tear trickled down the President's cheek at the mention of President Nixon's name while watching him at a big Black and Brown political rally.</p> <p>"It's a good name. A real politically influential Black politician has named a Black man. He's a big Black politician. Black President Nixon is going to be President of the United States of America in two weeks," Marius had said.</p> <p>"You really are a political influence here, aren't you?" Mavis had said.</p> <p>"I got caught up in this big election for President," President Nixon wouldn't have said.</p> <p>"I'm the guest of honor. This happens to be the big show that happens to every man," Mavis had said. He'd had said.</p> <p></p> <p>"I got caught him talking," George was a big.</p> <p>" a Big speech that was his speech?"</p> <p>" a speech " a speech</p> <p>" President " is big,"</p> <p></p> <p>" a speech" it's a—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
