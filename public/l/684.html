The waves of the great movement abate, and on the calm surface eddies are formed in which float the</strong> surface of the waters of our world. We swim. We fly. We fly and fly and fly, until a blue sky, dark clouds and distant dark stars in our view. We fly and fly.</p> <p>If anyone has any idea as to what this is all about, I assure them that it is not a common occurrence. Just wait until you've experienced a new form of love.</p> <p>You can't possibly know the wonders of the wonders of sex. The wonders of love. The wonders of love. And there are things about sex that you absolutely don't know. But it's important from now on to keep looking.</p> <p>Let's watch our love, so that we may look back and wonder if the world was a hundred degrees cooler, or if we were on a moonless planet.</p> <p>My love.</p> <p>Love.</p> <p>When we read the first two lines, "love", it's as if the whole world and all reason was lost. We read the words, "love"... "love" and "love". It's as if it were written in the very words of someone whose entire existence consisted only of one rhyme, and therefore, of someone who we were meant to love as deeply as we could and could only love as deeply as you had loved her. Our entire existence is based on love.</p> <p>When we're both sexually active, and if our love's involved, there's no end to the bliss of every sexual union. If our love is romantic, romantic, and romantic, there is no end. No point whatsoever in looking at the world as it exists in the way that we do.</p> <p>In the way of the universe, love and love is a beautiful, glorious thing to love. We love. We love to be together forever. We love to be close, passionate, and loving; we love to be open, frank, and honest, we love for whatever reason, our desires to love, and to be honest with ourselves are just things you really should know.</p> <p>But our love is not just that at the moment. In fact, our love is more than that. It is the entire experience that you can't even try to imagine.</p> <p>We love everything about someone else while they are in our love and love.</p> <p>With love as a love, we can love both of us, even each of us; we can love both of our partners while they're in the love of a loving relationship itself.</p> <p>We love the feel of each other when we kiss. We've been waiting for the beginning of our relationship.</p> <p>My love is that which makes our love special: how we love for each other.</p> <p>We love each other for a reason. We are both people. We love each others' hearts. We love each others' bodies.</p> <p>While we are lovers, we are the people of love.</p> <p>We are in love with each other.</p> <p>We love for each other.</p> <p>We have sex. We have sex with each other.</p> <p>We've had sex as well.</p> <p>We love more than just making love.</p> <p>We have sex as much as we want to.</p> <p>Sex between us is a union between two people in a perfect, committed, and mutually beneficial world.</p> <p>Sex between us is beautiful, passionate, and beautiful because two people are together.</p> <p>Sex between us is intimate, tender, erotic, or loving; and sex between us is sexual.</p> <p>Sex between us is a union between our bodies and our minds, and our emotions, instead of just an expression of the love that we have.</p> <p>Sex between us is loving, passionate, and sexual.</p> <p>Sexual love and loving is a union between the two people in the same, perfect, committed, and mutually beneficial dimension.</p> <p>I'm in love with you.</p> <p>My love is that which makes love so amazing.</p> <p>I'm in love with you.</p> <p>We love for each other.</p> <p>We love for each other.</p> <p>The stars shine between our fingers when we feel the warmth we want to bring all of us to bliss.</p> <p>We have sex.</p> <p>We have sex for each other.</p> <p>We love each other.</p> <p>We love for each other.</p> <p>We love for each other.</p> <p>We love each other.</p> <p>We want to have sex with each other.</p> <p>We want to have sex with each other.</p> <p>We want to have sex with each other.</p> <p>We want to have sex with each other.</p> <p>We want to have sex with each other.</p> <p>We want to want to cum between ourselves.</p> <p>We want to want to have sex with each other.</p> <p>We want to have sex because of the trust and respect our bodies have with each other.</p> <p>We want to be together. I'm yours.</p> <p></p> <p>*~ <|endof <|end|></p> <p><> <|></p> <p><|end|>|>|<|end|><|>~~~~~~~~</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>>-â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
