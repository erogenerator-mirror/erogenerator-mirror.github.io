English by Niccolò Machiavelli </h3><h4>CHAPTER XIX — THAT ONE SHOULD AVOID BEING DESPISED AND HATED</h4><p><strong>Now, concerning the characteristics of which mention is made above, I have spoken of the more important ones, the others I wish to discuss briefly under this generality, that the</strong> description of the individual's sex and the type of sex that it is in a description should convey. I believe they are in the lower case. Since I do not use these terms in a manner similar to "sex-only" in a description, I will go with the usage of "candy," "pussy-licking," or "licking," instead of using only the names for the other people using the names.</p> <p>There would be others who would use "tits," especially those "big tits" who would use them. They would see them as a metaphor for sex, and would use them to show that women, whether they live in an area other than the States, they are not considered to be sexy, nor desirable, but more of a social thing, to remind others of their sexuality. "Tits" would wear "candy" in reference to "clit." "Pussy" is another name as in "clit." We would use "cock" which would be obvious in such text, because "cock" would also give a clue to where my hand is on that particular area of my sex.</p> <p>But if there is anything else, I will start with some words.</p> <p>Candy has two possible meanings which do not have much of those meanings in a description, but the only ones I can think of are "clit" and "g-spot." Also, there might be others that are "cum."</p> <p>Candy is the closest and most common term of the adjective to refer to a female sex organ, but it is not used in a descriptive description; it is not used in a description. Cocks, dicks, dildos, cock-suckers, balls, asses, anything else you may call it.</p> <p>G-spot, is the term which is used in reference to a female organ which must be referred to as "vagina." If there is a name for this noun referring to woman's genitals that is applied to a sexual organ, it has also been mentioned. So it should also be applied to a woman's pussy. (G-spot, and clit, although also used in a description, means that a female female is referred to as "gift."</p> <p>If there are no more than six nouns, then "vagina" would be followed.</p> <p>In a good description one has to use a specific term, such as a person, "cunt." In a discussion there should be some name for what they are called.</p> <p>A description of the person or organ and the person's gender, would usually be as follows:</p> <p>*A cocksucker.</p> <p>*A motherfucker.</p> <p>*A cuckold.</p> <p>*He was made for sucking cock.</p> <p>*He was made to suck a womans cock.</p> <p>*He wanted to be a motherfucker.</p> <p>*He sucked a womans clit.</p> <p>*He had two cocks in each of the women in the room at the time.</p> <p>*He wanted to be a motherfucker.</p> <p>*He had the third cock in his mouth.</p> <p>*He sucked the third cock.</p> <p>*It made him horny.</p> <p>*It made him horny for an older cuckold.</p> <p>*He did it.</p> <p>*He blew his motherfucker.</p> <p>*He did it for a younger man.</p> <p>*He blew his motherfucker for a younger woman.</p> <p>*He blew his motherfucker for a younger man.</p> <p>*He gave a blowjob for a younger cuckold.</p> <p>*He gave a blowjob for a younger man.</p> <p>*He blew a younger man.</p> <p>If you choose to be a cuckold without actually doing this, then I am not an ignorant old woman giving an adult cuckold a blowjob.</p> <p>What is the average age and sex of the various persons, and of course, how much it takes for the person to know what is the sex of the person, for instance:</p> <p>a. Some people get it on with more women than others, whereas others always have sex with less man, while others want sex with a particular guy.</p> <p>b. Many people enjoy a good blowjob of the person's cock. Some people like it better with a woman's mouth rather than with a man's.</p> <p>c. Some people like the oral sex better with a woman's mouth, while others like the oral sex better after giving the guy a blowjob of the girl's mouth. Some people like having the woman take the cock in her mouth, while others like her sucking a penis, while others like the guy ejaculates doing cocks on their tits.</p> <p>e. There is an event, some people like fucking can suck a woman's mouth more than other's. e sucking is cocks more—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
