The Treasure</h4><p><strong>When Dantès returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity, he found Faria seated and looking composed. In the ray of light which entered by the narrow</strong> window in the door of her bedroom while she slept, Faria reflected that she was the first person, ever alive who'd had an intimate day. Dantès, having just come into captivity with her lover, had been a dream come true. And, she remembered her first night with him. But, what about the future now? She'd met Dantès, but her first time with man. But, she didn't know for sure what she was and was still, even though Dantès had made such a good sport of making love to her when she'd been pregnant.</p> <p>Dantès: 'How do you feel today?'</p> <p>Dantès: 'I'm okay.'</p> <p>Dantès: 'Good.'</p> <p>Dantès: 'I think that's better.'</p> <p>Dantès: 'Better' is exactly the wrong word.</p> <p>Dantès: 'Better' is better.</p> <p>Dantès: 'Oh God!'</p> <p>Gosh! I have to do this! I can't believe that I'm going to do it! To myself, I can't believe that I'm going to actually have sex with this man! But, I can't.</p> <p>What? When? How? How can I even consider it?</p> <p>Dantès: 'When is 'the moment'?'</p> <p>Gosh. Why doesn't anyone understand what love is? Doesn't everyone understand about love?</p> <p>The day begins.</p> <p>*************************</p> <p>Dantès: 'Hey, you! What are we doing?'</p> <p>Dantès: 'We're going to do just about every naughty fantasy you've ever had.'</p> <p>Dantès: 'And we're going to do almost everything!'</p> <p>Dantès: 'Oh God!'</p> <p>Dantès: 'Oh God! Fuck me! Please! Do me!'</p> <p>Dantès: 'I'm so ready!'</p> <p>Dantès: 'Please, fuck me! Fuck me!'</p> <p>Dantès: 'Fuck me! Fuck me!'</p> <p>Dantès: 'I need to!'</p> <p>Dantès: 'I want you to!'</p> <p>Dantès: 'I want you to!'</p> <p>Dantès: 'I want to! Oh, God!'</p> <p>Dantès: 'I'm ready!'</p> <p>Dantée:</p> <p>I was so aroused by all this. Then I knew what it was that was going to happen. Oh, I'm so ready and I'm begging you to do this for me. I've waited so long to do this but not like this.</p> <p>I'd just been waiting all day. I'm ready.</p> <p>I knew that it was time. I'm ready and waiting. I was so damn eager.</p> <p>And, it's so good because neither of us has to think any more. I'm ready and so am you! I'm ready.</p> <p>As I slid my dick inside of you, I knew that the moment had arrived. As I felt your pussy begin to spasm, as your body responded, as you began to cum, as your pussy tightened around my cock and as I continued to fuck you, I felt that I was finally going to cum inside of you. I'd wanted to feel that feeling for so long, you were so receptive. I knew that you weren't going to make another move until it felt right. Until, finally, we were both ready to go on. You were ready to go on. I was ready to go on. So was you.</p> <p>Then, as you lay back on the bed, I began pounding your pussy in earnest. I couldn't believe that your pussy was finally responding to my cock, and that I was finally fucking you! I wanted to fuck right away. I wanted to fuck you hard and cum inside of you. And, I wanted to cum inside of your hot pussy. I had wanted to fuck you for what seemed like eternity, but I also knew that, even though our bodies came together as one, my cock was still just as hard as yours was.</p> <p>As I fucked your pussy, I knew that your pussy was now responding, and that it would be enough. Your pussy was ready for my dick and I was ready for your body for mine. I finally would be ready to be able to be able to return my own your pussy. To return mine. To be yours.</p> <p></p> <p>You opened your legs,</p> <p>I entered your vagina and was, opened your legs I could enter your pussy—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
