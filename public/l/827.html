The cab bowled slowly along</strong> the promenade, and, as they got to the bottom, he made sure it was clear. She is the most stunning woman I’ve ever seen, he thought. She wore a low-cut dress that could have been worn by many women, but he could sense a real undercurrent to it when his eyes feasted on her bosom.</p> <p>“This is all for you, Darling,” she whispered. “I was going to be here a little late, and I wanted to see what would be a great time if I was here tomorrow.”</p> <p>“I hope you are ready for the wedding,” he said, gazing seductively at her breasts as she reached out, taking his hand. “I’ll tell you. I have a surprise.”</p> <p>She kissed him with a light, sensuous kiss. Their lips caressed one another. Their hands explored each other’s bodies. Their kisses grew more frenzied as she pushed him further into the room. She stopped at the door, taking her handbag over her arm while giving his arm a firm squeeze. He led her into the room and began to unbutton her dress. After the final button came the front, and at the same time taking off her bra, he took her panties off with him. He sat on the edge of the bed and took her in his arms, kissing her deeply.</p> <p>“It’s time for our surprise.”</p> <p>He pulled her up, and she felt him undoing her bra. She took off her panties and put them on the bed. She climbed into the bed and lay back, looking at him through a haze of lust.</p> <p>“You know, I’ve wondered if this was the night my fantasy comes true.”</p> <p>He climbed on the bed beside her. As she stared at him, he ran his fingertips lightly across her chest and up her neck to her lips.</p> <p>“The only question is what my surprise might be,” he said.” He kissed her again, then rolled across her to the other side. He placed his hand on her left breast and gently squeezed it, his fingertips brushing her nipple. She lay on her back, her breasts heaving slightly.</p> <p>“I couldn’t wait. This will never happen.”</p> <p>He slid his hand down her body, kissing her neck and shoulder. Then he began sucking on her nipple, rolling it over his tongue with his flattened lips. Then he slid his finger towards her cunt as he continued to massage her nipple with his lips. His touch was feather-light, but with increasing power, as he moved his hand down, massaging her stomach and slipping his finger into her sopping twat. He felt her shudder as she felt him touch her, and she reached for him again, running her hand through his hair as he took the weight of her in his hands and held her. Again he slid down to her navel, kissing the soft skin as he tickled her outer lips. His tongue probed her cunt again, licking up through her opening, causing her to groan loudly, a sound of want. She felt him slide off her panties as he worked his mouth back up her body, planting kisses and licks on her breasts and belly, his fingers stroking the hair back from her pussy.</p> <p>He slid his lips back down her body, licking her navel and down to her cunt. His touch was feather-light, with no force, almost a caress, as he kissed, licked, and sucked on her clit.</p> <p>“Yes, Baby! Harder! Please take me to Paradise!”</p> <p>“Please, Darling.”</p> <p>“Take me to Paradise?” she called through her closed legs. “Come with me, Love. I’m on the bed.”</p> <p>He followed her to the bed as she undressing, kissing, nibbling, and tasting every inch of her. She moved to sit astride him, taking his cock in her hand and guiding him inside her.</p> <p>“Oh, Darling.”</p> <p>“That’s it, Baby. Come for me...”</p> <p>Furaciousness was his only thought as he entered her to her g-spot. She felt her body begin to shiver, as waves of pleasure flowed from her nipples and through her whole body, culminating in her first orgasm of the evening. She couldn’t say another word!<|> until her body was numbingly filled with his cock.</p> <p>As her pussy flooded with his cock and his cum, he felt the way of the way of God.</p> <p></p> <p>of, the wind, of God and the power of creation—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
