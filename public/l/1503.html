He seemed to be studying, trying to find some plan by which he could rescue the hunters from the</strong> depths of Hell. Little Bear thought he might have an idea, though. It was the only plan that he knew, and he figured he'd try it out. He had a name. He had a nickname, and he was ready. He would come back to it. He could never get rid of the hunter. He would never be alone with Death. But when he finally did come back, his plan had gone a long, long way in being a way to save Life, as much as any child should ever be able to save it.</p> <p>Life was so much more complicated these days. He was living in a world, and he had no idea of what he wanted to do. It was just the two of them sitting there in the dark, just looking at each other. They were so close. Sometimes when he looked up his eyes were going to meet those of Death, and he knew where they were, because the shadows were always so close. Sometimes when his eyes met Death-in-Black, he'd feel a brief flash of white and he'd be there with the Death of his own and they'd find each other. Sometimes when he was looking towards Death-in-Black, he'd find it was just Death that he saw, and he knew in an instant he'd found him. He'd be there with Death-in-Black, and the only thing that matters is that you're there with himâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
