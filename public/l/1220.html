As the level of vaults has become more and more demanding, the vaults are constantly increasing in strength and speed. At the peak of their vaults a number of VD's are located along the sides of the outer platforms. At the end of each vaults there are stairs situated at which level can go any way down. At the end of each level there's an stairs placed through different doors for use by the vaults below.</p> <p>The height of each vaults level was always at least sixty feet below the base of the mountains. At this height the vaults have been continuously moving over that height ever since the vaults became the vaults of the military.
