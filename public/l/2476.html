That is my question.</p> <p>"Don't be a fool! You know what this means! How could any of this happen!"</p> <p>I smiled at Mary and replied, "Your husband is the reason that it is."</p> <p>"I never stopped loving him. Even when he was a jerk to me. The last thing I want to do is to fall in love with that ugly man. If I can't forgive him my heart will begin to ache."</p> <p>I said, "Well, you are here now; what can I do for you?"</p> <p>"I don't need a man for anything, so just leave it alone."</p> <p>"Ok," I agreed, now it was up to Mary to explain.</p> <p>"This is a little easier than I would have thought. My ex boyfriend did all of the work! He was really great. And he fucked me to the punch! And we both liked it! I was still married then so we were good. I love you, John."</p> <p>"I love you, Mary. It was just a little hard to forget that it wasn't even you I loved. Oh! It's right again. I think that's it."</p> <p>Mary smiled, pulled me in and kissed me. She whispered in my ear, "You just have to remember that you are the only man that I can really spend time with."</p> <p>It was about a week later that we talked about sex, and how much we had talked about it before. I said, "Yeah, I know. Your boyfriend is just so good."</p> <p>She smiled at me as her hand dropped to my erection. "I don't think we need to worry. I've been watching you masturbate, too. I love it when you do that."</p> <p>"It feels even better when you can watch me," I smiled, feeling her hand squeezing it.</p> <p>She smiled and whispered, "I like to watch."</p> <p>"I want to see you play with yourself."</p> <p>"That sounds like fun," she replied, looking puzzled.</p> <p>"You'd like to see me?" I asked. "I just want to watch you play with your pussy."</p> <p>"That's not all it has to do. I have an initiation ceremony. I have to get on that altar." She laughed as she looked at my erection.</p> <p>I pulled on my pants and answered, "I still don't see how you can possibly be serious. You'll have to teach me about those things. Come!" I took her by her hand and escorted her over to the bed. We climbed on the altar and I helped her get her skirt off. I laid on the ground and watched her walk over to it and bend over. She spread her legs apart as far as her lacy thong would allow as she looked back over her shoulder at me. The material stretched tightly onto her ass and covered nothing.</p> <p>"You just look so sweet!" I said as I rubbed my finger over her vagina.</p> <p>"Ohhhhhh!!!!"</p> <p>She pushed her pussy back towards my eager finger. I could see the moisture slowly start to drip out her lips. I pressed it between her lips and then began to rub my finger against her opening. At the same time, I inserted my finger into her. It was tight inside her and I could see her little pussy muscles contract around it as I massaged it.</p> <p>She felt so good as I slid my finger from her pussy to her small clit. "Oh God!" She exclaimed a few seconds later. I could see the muscles of her vagina contract around my finger as I started to massage her clit.</p> <p>Mary groaned and looked back over her shoulder at me as I began to rub her clit. Then she lifted her hips and moved them over my hand as it rubbed against her. I could not stand this all. I leaned in and moved my face down to lick her. As we kissed and moved our bodies apart Mary moaned.</p> <p>Then with one hand she moved it down from me to her pussy. I could see her pink pussy lips and her swollen clit. I started to suck on her clit and she lifted her hips again. She began to make little little whimpers each time I did. Then she came hard on my face. It was as if everything I had ever known about women's sexual responses had been just a dream.</p> <p>"That was soooo nice!" She told me, and smiled again as I kissed her again.</p> <p>"Yes, it was," I replied and then I helped her down on the altar again. Now we were in position to make love. There was no barrier between us. She loved it! I could kiss her legs and I could hold it and she could kiss her mouth. It was a part of the body! Our love together and the soul. But nothingâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
