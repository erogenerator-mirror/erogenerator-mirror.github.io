When he lay, her arms were up over her head and her legs, spread wide apart. Her breasts and nipples are on perfect display for him. He takes no further foreplay, just sits on the bed where they were.</p> <p>He kneels on the bed and moves her thighs apart exposing her cunt. He moves in, then spreads her labia and touches her clit. He slowly inserts his fingers inside her, but moves his fingers in the same circular fashion. He moves his hand back to her clit, massages it until she's ready for more fingers. He moves in closer, still moving his fingers, with more intensity. When he touches the tip of her clit with it, he stops, and then he pushes it in another notch until she's ready. It's too far to be far away from her clit now.</p> <p>He stops again, but slowly, gently moves his fingers in a steady rhythm as he begins to tease her labia. "Put your hands behind you on the bed," he says.</p> <p>She does it. She puts one hand behind her back and does it while the other hand caresses her boobs.</p> <p>She reaches over with her other hand and touches him as he plays with her pussy. He begins to rub her clitoris faster, and in turn, rubs her pussy. He starts to kiss her, and then he starts to lick all around there, which she willingly accepts.</p> <p>While his mouth and tongue roam around her pussy, his fingers continue to rub her clit. She's close to cumming again, but doesn't want to yet. She wants to be touched, sucked, felt, all of the sensations. "Touch me. Oh, yes. Right there. Yes. Don't stop. That's so good. Just like that."</p> <p>He's moving his fingers faster, and her clit is being licked and sucked. He moves his fingers inside from time to time, and she's on the point of coming. It's only a few moments before he stops.</p> <p>Her body is trembling from her orgasm, she can't say anything, but she's willing to let him please her some more, even when she's at the end. "How did that feel?" he asks her. "Did that feel good?"</p> <p>Before she can say, "yes," he takes her mouth with his in her cunt, and goes into a frenzy on her, sucking on her mouth. He's also pushing her into another orgasm. He is just as excited as she is, but his hunger to have her is greater than hers. He's getting close, but never reaches her again. She can see he's getting hard. She can just imagine what his cock looks like. But he really isn't hard. He just doesn't get hard.</p> <p>She doesn't want him to. That would be too embarrassing to do such things to him.</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"Can I be naked and in your bed?" she asks.</p> <p>"No. We don't have intercourse yet. Right now it's not necessary."</p> <p>"I don't care," she says, "but if we have intercourse, I want to see you, touch you, kiss you." Her words are alluring, but so much of the sexiness she likes to share with him is hidden. She feels her breasts press against him, and her thigh wraps around him.</p> <p>He knows she wants him, too, and has a strong plan for her. He has her all the way, but he wants her to wait a little while, to allow her to be ready, to see his erection again when he finally enters her. He can't wait to be in her again, but now he's going to make love to her again. But she hasn't waited much longer. Not long.</p> <p>"Turn on all of the lights. There will be something in the bathroom when you come in." He likes the idea of making love standing up. It's the first time he's been naked in her presence, and now it's his first time. He likes standing up naked. It's so different feeling another's naked and flesh against his skin. And he likes it more for herself.</p> <p>She turns off all of the lights. The only light coming from the candle is in the bathroom. She sees everything she's ever wanted. She sees herself in the mirror, seeing how her skin looks different than his own, but that it's hers only. She gets out of bed and walks down to the bathroom. When she gets there, she sees her panties lying on the mirror. She grabs them and puts them on when she goes to herself. She's shower. She takes the wash her fingers and her hand, and her body. They're the cum. That was already, the most of it is dried from her mind and doesn't even better than her. She was herâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
