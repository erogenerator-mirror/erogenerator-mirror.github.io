In their attitude toward him could</strong> only be taken to a greater degree and their intentions the longer they stayed away.</p> <p>In fact, their intentions were to fuck each other without the need to hide their thoughts and not share the feeling of lust.</p> <p>The soldier's thoughts and their attitudes were that he would never feel what he was feeling with his own eyes without seeing it. He loved his mother and his mother saw everything. He saw and cherished it and understood it too. He remembered her in his mind's eye. She would take him with her at the same time he fell for her but without a man. He could not have imagined her in any of those situations but he had to be realistic.</p> <p>He realized the irony of his attitude was so different from his relationship with his father. It meant the world to him but a relationship between his father and the love of his life wasn't so much.</p> <p>Their love was not the way he felt. It was not his intention to love someone without her. He felt like he should not be in this situation but she could play the role of the mother she had not the best of.</p> <p>For Pierre, that mother wasn't there when he was being raped while feeling his son's heart in the same way that he was being raped. He would never be that way. Pierre's love, that love was his brother's, and that love wasn't a love he felt that his own daughter could be.</p> <p>The thought of that love flashed through his mind but he fought it off. He had to admit to himself that he was in love with his mother but he was also in love with the man, his father, and his love for himself.</p> <p>He just wondered how he would feel if he was with a man and not his mother.</p> <p>A part of Pierre didn't want to think about it. He wondered how he would feel with the woman beside him.</p> <p>He did not want to see his mother naked. He didn't want to have sex with her. He didn't want his mother to have sex with him. Pierre had his father's strong body and the woman's body. It was hard to imagine and Pierre had no way to imagine the situation.</p> <p>With some trepidation, Pierre knew it would be difficult to find the appropriate man. They would have to find someone to be able to fuck without them being with a woman.</p> <p>His mother would want a man who would not give up sex. She would want a man who was able to get off with her without losing his wife. She would want a man who would enjoy her like a man would not share her with. She wanted her son to have something she desired with a man's cock if it was an honest man.</p> <p>He had never felt such a desire in his life as he felt right now. The thought of it sent chills down his spine as it occurred to him how much of a disappointment he caused his mother when she was being unfaithful. She would not want to see him with his father. She'd want to have sex with her son, she'd want to have sex with this man. And Pierre knew if he looked into her eyes he would see her tears. She'd be a whore, a cheap whore and she'd want to throw money on a bed, take her son away and have an affair but if she saw the love in her eyes, if she saw the love I feel in my heart, her face was the same as mine.</p> <p>Her eyes would be a tear on her cheek. They would be tears of regret. If anything, they were tears of happiness.</p> <p>The thought that her eyes were tears of joy brought to Pierre's mind but he shook it off and put a strong arm around his mother. They fell asleep at the same time but in the same way that Pierre fell asleep.</p> <p>When they awoke in the morning they found they each had a smile on their faces and they sat up and smiled at each other. They were both satisfied since their meeting with Pierre.</p> <p>Pierre's father was as satisfied with what his son had just done as he was by having his mother fucked. The thought of watching her being fucked by her son while having a man's cum in her vagina wasn't anything like the fun that he had the moment he came home in the morning.</p> <p>It would be awkward to be with him again after their meeting.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Comments too positive would be nice but too negative would be a disappointment.
