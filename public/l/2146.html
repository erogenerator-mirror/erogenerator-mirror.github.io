When thou seest Satyro, think of Socraticus and Eutyches, or</h4><p><strong>Hymen, and when Euphrates, think of Eutychio, and Sylvanus, when Alciphron, of Tropaeophorus, when Xenophon, of Crito, or Severus. And when thou doest look upon thyself, fancy unto thyself some</strong> who beheld the same as others. For, as God will also also see, thy body will be as one, as the one you are. You are one. Your thoughts be, and not so long as thou have a husband. Thou have thyselves, when a wife thou dost trust in love, to a woman who is not as she was. Thus, a wife be shall not, for she will be free, and have the same love that she be.</p> <p>"Aphrodite was made, as though she is made: she is made of that as herself. Than I shall be. Now, go on, as thou must also. Come: the first of you to be blessed by the first, and you best be ready to do that.</p> <p>Aphrodite saw the glistening of lust upon Selphion and felt her body tremble and quake. She looked upon her husband's nakedness, still slick with all the sperm she had tasted, as she looked upon her own. She had tasted her own on his cock, on his lips, and his tongue. And her own mouth was now full, as it had been of the first.</p> <p>Aphrodite put her hands forward to hold her husband in place, so she could continue to lick his cock, as he had seen her doing in the library.</p> <p>He began to move it inside her mouth, a rhythm now. He felt himself rise and felt himself come up to fill this glorious creature with his ejaculation. She held herself still, allowing him to do this while she still had all the sperm. Euphrates, and Syre, both were now as one, as they watched their husband and wife become one. Both women were panting now, in bliss, and both began to climax themselves together.</p> <p>"Aphrodite felt her pussy being squeezed and spasmed and her vagina walls were spasming against this man's cock, as his climax reached its peak, and his juices spilled from her mouth. "Aphrodite, be glad thou can't have thee. Thou will have as much of thyself, as you do with Eurystania. And thou will be as fulfilled thou have known."</p> <p>"And thou be a hypocrite, as thou thinkth of thy husband. That thy own will, is what thou maketh," Selphion said, kissing Aphrodite more deeply than he had ever kissed any woman in his life, her arms now around him, and the other between his own.</p> <p>They continued in the same bed for many hours that night, as Euphrates, with a new passion, began to become more insistent and eager toward the coupling she sought for the next day.</p> <p>"I shall make you happy at the pleasure of it," she said.</p> <p>"And so shall I," he answered. "As thou shall be."</p> <p>"But thou go also with me, so that thy husband may pleasure thee with the pleasure he should have with my own, and it shall be a pleasure for himself only." She knew this was what she meant to say about this, to set the hook in her husband's desire for her, as he made the first.</p> <p>Thus did it come to happen. One day, Aphrodite heard from Syre that she could see a beautiful woman in her bedroom on her back with a man's legs spread before her, and her body being fucked by his cock as soon he ejaculated in her womb. And, as they were about to make love, Syre said, "Hymena, may I be sure thou is worthy to be as thy husband and thy wife. I know you want to, but I want to have thee, as if thou, my friend, are a part of me."</p> <p>"Yes," Aphrodite said, with a smile. "I certainly am."</p> <p>"I shall make thee feel as great as I, if thou may take me and have me also." She was a little surprised at this, at first, as he had no intention of being so much a man. The thought of her husband and of him made her laugh out loud, as she and Syre had never before been as passionate in love, as she had been about that time she had made love to herself in the library.</p> <p>But before she did this he had a very different idea. Syre was no man, but her friend, while she was, and her husband's wife and the friend had been both, in their imagination, as had she. Her husband would do the same as her, she was sure of it.</p> <p>Syre, of course, had her own an idea, as he said, that Aphrodite thought he would. She would go for herself. She would be the one that way, and the way. She would keep her body the bed for that way with Eury.
