Please read the first story to know how it is written and, if you've read this, you'd best come back to it, too, because it's the best thing you'll ever read.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>The first day of freshman orientation week. I wanted to go to the movies, that was the ticket offer I was on. It was the Friday after the day my freshman year had broken up our relationship. There was a party. I didn't know how we would get laid, but we managed to get it out of our system.</p> <p>I had taken the subway to class on campus. A big group of us met in the car, and after class we had sex – a sex in the middle of the day. It was a big deal! We were both drunk, as you would expect, and we were kissing deeply and deeply. One of us got off and we made a trip to the bathroom and made sure both were clean. We kissed a lot and had sex several times. I have to say, I'd almost lost control during the entire drive.</p> <p>When we got to the movie theatre, my roommate and I sat in the far seat by the window and peered through the curtains in the darkness. The movie must have had a lesbian scene, because we could see stars and people in the crowd. We'd finished our date before we left at nine, and one of us got in the back seat with me. We sat in the back with this other person for as long as we could, until we got bored and got out onto the street. It was a good night for us. We didn't sleep that night.</p> <p>We went back to the party. We decided that we would go with what we had before and not go home.</p> <p>Before the party the next night we went to a dance. That was the first time we had been together with another couple. We were a lot the same size.</p> <p>We were both in her bra and pants – I had a black pair, hers was a white one. We danced and danced, kissed and laughed, and danced and danced. We could see our roommate's car in the back seat.</p> <p>One date led to another and we never repeated it. We had sex with each other to keep out of school, but we did not go back.</p> <p>But our relationship never stopped. Our roommate left me for another girl, a girl named Marisa.</p> <p>We met for the first time as freshmen year, at the student center. I'd had a boyfriend a while ago, he had started off with me for his own satisfaction. This was my first time with a girl but it was a good time.</p> <p>In my college days I'd had sex with guys before, but after I'd had sex with my roommate I thought it was something special. Sex with guys had become my passion.</p> <p>I met Marisa in the Student Center. I'd already gone through her locker and seen her clothes, clothes and stuff. It was the first time I'd been with a girl. We went to the coffee shop, had coffee, ate lunch, and talked about ourselves. Marisa was a lot of fun. She loved my roommate. They had no money, no car. Marisa was good looking, but she was also really shy. A lot like my roommate – short hair, long legs, a figure to die for. Marisa had had sex with a lot and most people were attracted to them. She wanted to get laid.</p> <p>I'd never had such an encounter before. After a couple hours of the coffee shop, we went to a small party, dancing and sipping a drink each. Marisa was flirty. She'd do a sexy strip tease for an audience.</p> <p>The next day, Marisa and I got a date at the university. Our date night was to go to a local museum exhibit. I was supposed to be there later that night because I was working. We got dressed up, had hot, sexy sex in the museum exhibit, then went back to my room to fool around.</p> <p>A few days later, the museum exhibit turned into a sex museum show. I went to my dorm room in the darkness, and Marisa went to my room, and I followed her, in a different room in the back of the museum exhibit.</p> <p>We got into the museum again, got naked, and got naked around the exhibit. We had sex there, then got another drink in the same room. I was pretty nervous, she seemed kind of hot. We were done, and we got dressed, and it hadn't gotten dressed. My roommate left us. Marisa wanted to stay naked. We stayed naked, we got dressed and I didn't, then got sex, and with some more sex. We took off.</p> <p></p> <p>We got to get more—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
