English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>LXVIII. THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR.</h4><p><strong>When Zarathustra had left the ugliest man, he was chilled and felt lonesome: for much coldness and lonesomeness came over his spirit, so that even his limbs became colder thereby.</strong></p> <p>But all that vanished in the next moment. He was on top, riding Zarathustra, fucking the hell out of him. The muscles of his body were burning. His dick had the feeling of being gripped too tightly as if it could not take in any more.</p> <p>But to have them both fucked, and make them both orgasm simultaneously was an even greater feeling than before. A more powerful act to induce.</p> <p>That is why he fucked his lover; to make both their pussies dripping and dripping and then make them climax together, a different act to which he could not even imagine. But in this way, he felt it, and he saw it in their eyes.</p> <p>Because the two sex organs seemed so excited, and therefore the two would achieve orgasm together, it was a feeling of mutual sexual bliss. But then two people have sex together; in their minds, it was like a double-edged sword.</p> <p>Zarathustra was more active, fucking Zarathustra, taking the time to savour the moment, and to let the moment flow by. Like the time before, it was a moment of great ecstasy.</p> <p>Though they moaned together with delight, they were not fucking. Zarathustras eyes were closed, and his eyes were shut. The lips of his mouth formed a silent smile as he took in the sight of his lover fucking the fucker whom her lover was giving her.</p> <p>It was an expression of absolute bliss, the most indescribable expression of sexual ecstasy that might have come a bit more normally. But this expression did have the effect of pushing both of them further towards bliss, as if the moment were just a little bit longer, and so their bodies would be more aware of each other's pleasures.</p> <p>It also was a little shorter than two minutes, and because Zarathustra was more active, the fucking was more vigorous. He felt more vigorous in the beginning; he knew that it was inevitable that the two sex organs of his lover should reach their orgasm.</p> <p>Zarathustra felt more than felt satisfaction also, as he moaned the moment the moment entered. In his mind-shattering ecstasy, he moaned that this was the moment of ultimate joy, and he had to give thanks for it. He wanted to make it for both of them again.</p> <p>They kissed as a couple of lovers do, sharing the pleasure with one another, and then again, and then without the kissing, they embraced each other, their hands were roaming the others body as if it were a couple.</p> <p>They embraced each other tightly in that state of absolute sensation that they had, before and after the lovemaking, with no means of keeping them in their mind. They were lost in a world of pleasure and sensation, as one could never leave it, or could never feel again.</p> <p>Although his mind was foggy from sexual desire, his body felt nothing but complete ecstasy. Although it was a beautiful sensation, it did not even occur to him to think, to say anything, about it; but he was like a man in a dream; feeling the total love the two had for each other.</p> <p>Then Zarathustra's mind came up in a fog, and when a pair of hands came into the fog, ZarathUSTras' eyes opened. He saw his own lover, his lover was naked, with the lust in his eyes for him, and the lust in his eyes a total and un-fucking-innngg.</p> <p>But the lust was in his eyes, and the lust was written on his face. His body looked as pure joy.</p> <p>The two bodies embraced; the two lovers embraced in the moment of absolute rapture. Kissing, kissing, kissing and kissing, Zarathustras eyes were shut, and Zarathustras body was on fire. His hips were moving towards the union of his lover. His hands were caressing his lover's body, moving as the lovers were moving towards the ultimate climax.</p> <p>The lust in his eyes was written all over his mind, and in his mind, and he felt like he could not leave that same orgasm that the two lovers were already building, it was so strong, and so wonderful, and he wanted to savour being with her, in fact, and especially in this form.</p> <p>His love for her was so profound that he could never leave her, but he felt as if his body itself was leaving him, in the heat of his lust. He felt as if it would never come in this form, never againâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
