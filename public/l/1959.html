As the ordinary shows of the theatre and of other such places,</h4><p><strong>when thou art presented with them, affect thee; as the same things still seen, and in the same fashion, make the sight ingrateful and tedious; so must all the things</strong> to inspire.</p> <p>As the song had so happened, my hands moved to the buttons of her dress. She turned and undid her dress. I removed her bra. Her breasts were ample. I reached behind her. The zip at the back slipped as she lifted her arms toward my shoulders but then slid my arms out. Her dress fell on the floor.</p> <p>I stood there with my cock waiting with a semi-hard state, wondering what to do. This girl was hot. Her arms came off her head and I embraced her. She gave a light moan. I caress her face and hair with my fingertips. Then I went down her body with my tongue until I was between her legs. I spread her cheeks, leaned to see what her ass had done to his cock. Then I licked her vagina again and she sighed with joy. The sweetness of her vagina. The puckered hole. Then came her clitoris. I sucked it in as far as I could and as I did, she cried. I sucked it in further; then worked my tongue around it.</p> <p>My manhood jumped. Then I went back to eating her. I licked her clit, took it in my mouth again, then licked her vagina, taking as much as I could as deep as I could. Then I went back to eating her.</p> <p>My manhood strained even more, standing out from my fly as it strained in the air. I was in rapture. Then she started moaning and I felt her legs lock around my waist, pulling me on top of her. So did I. We kissed, our lips sucking each other for dear life. I licked the pussy from top to bottom, taking it in between my teeth, then back down her thighs to her anus. I took the whole place, until her pussy juice trickled in front of me; then I licked there, licking her vagina, opening it, pushing it in.</p> <p>I couldn't do it any more. I had to come inside her, and I made it happen. I rose up, then took her by the shoulders, still inside, then got off. We kissed again while she pulled her leg towards me and I sat on it, while she laid on the desk. It was time for some work, so I kneeled and got between her legs. I bent down until our lips touched. Then I moved forward, moving her legs further apart. She lifted her feet to open me. I took more time. I entered. It was good. Wonderful.</p> <p>She cried out, and I cried out; then I went on and on, taking more, taking more time, driving it inside her vagina, until she got very excited. She was coming hard. So was I. She came long time.</p> <p>"That's it. Give it to me. Fuck me. Oh! Oh! Oh!"</p> <p>I drove myself in as far as I could go. Her tight vagina clutched at my cock as I bottomed out in her. I kept on coming, spurting inside her in two long time, shooting every drop that I could.</p> <p>We lay there till we got our breath back. Then she got up, kissed me between my legs, then she bent, kissing me on my lips as well. As she was leaving us our kiss, she opened her arms and said, "I'm your new life. You'll see me there."</p> <p>I felt excited. And excited, a dream come true, so I was! I had finally found another girl. A girl who wouldn't mind having a cock inside her when I'm ready.</p> <p>I got up, walked around and took her in my arms.</p> <p>"I loved you," I said. And I kissed her lips." I didn't mean it, but, you are the most attractive of persons whom I am going to see."</p> <p>She turned around, kissed me, then stood. She had a black skirt; one that showed off her legs and the curve of her butt. And was a little bit too small, because of the panties inside the panties. I felt sorry as I saw it. She went to the window, came back with a scarf, and tied the strings around it. She tied the front. Then she came back with a scarf, then put it over her open mouth.</p> <p>I saw the lights of her apartment in the window. And, I saw her clothes in the window, but not the way I saw before. And I saw her body on the carpet. I saw the way she was bending over in front of me. I saw her bare legs, which parted in front of me again. I saw her thighs glistening in pink. And just from being exposed like this to her body like this. I thought about my own soul as well. I was so I had a soul.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I saw her the most I andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
