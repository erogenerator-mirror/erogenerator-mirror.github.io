He even used his best acting skills as a movie star for his movies before his marriage.</p> <p>So why now, I'm a porn actor? The answer is simple. He's just getting started. He's not only a director or a writer, he's an actor, and I can't wait to watch him doing a scene.</p> <p>I'm in a bit of a hurry. I need to get home before he arrives. I've already set the alarm clock, I'm ready to start. And when he arrives tonight I wanna see him first.</p> <p>Tonight is going to be quite interesting.</p> <p>-----------------------------------</p> <p>Jules has been a friend of mine for a long time. She just turned forty two, and I have known her since before we began having sex. She was born on Monday to the same folks I grew up too and never thought she'd marry or anything similar. We were both in our early 40's, and had just been married for ten years. We did everything in our lives together. You know, just sex, we got married when we were twenty, we got married when we were twenty two; we both had three kids from the same parent - we still have them still do, which has just never happened before, and we were married just before I met her.</p> <p>Jules and I met a little more than a year ago, which made our first year at the same school quite special. She, like I, had just turned twenty five after graduation and was now a single mother.</p> <p>Jules and I had been living together for almost a year, and although we weren't in a relationship yet, we were pretty committed with one another. We're still friends, and had an amazing time together, and had been getting closer after the last of our friends left for Iraq.</p> <p>About an hour before the alarm, we had an hour to ourselves. I got out of the shower, and as soon as I was dried off and dressed, Jules came into the living room naked from a shower. She sat down and pulled off her jeans and panties to reveal, like, not too tiny, but just perfectly rounded and feminine, a beautifully shaped pair of legs and her beautiful, perfectly erect nipples. Jules said, "Hi, baby" and looked up into my eyes. "Hey," I replied, "You're so beautiful."</p> <p>I kissed her, "Thank you." I kissed her again. It was one of those moment when you are completely certain that you feel like you're having an orgasm from just one kiss. We kissed passionately for a little while, and I fondled her naked boobs. She made a low moan and said, "We should take our time. We can't be having sex now. Right now my panties are soaked."</p> <p>"Jules, I don't want to ruin the moment," I said as I slid my hand under her panties and began rubbing her mound with my fingers. She was soaking wet, I could tell. I slid my fingers into her pussy, rubbed with my thumb for a moment, and she responded with a squishy moan and said, "Do that again." I pushed two fingers deep inside of her. They were moist from all our juices.</p> <p>I leaned down and pulled her pussy lips apart, and slid two fingers in her and pumped them in and out for a few moments before returning my position on her tits. I pulled my fingers away from her and held them in my other hand. They were soaked. She said, "You're soaked." I was not going to argue.</p> <p>Once again, I looked up to see she smiled and said, "Are you ready?" I told her I was, and she reached down and squeezed her right cheek gently. I leaned down and started again, while she continued to rub her pussy up and down.</p> <p>We kissed some more. I rubbed my thumb into her pubic mound gently, and started moving my fingers around the outside of her lips. I took her clit into my mouth, and started sucking on it softly while she continued to work her pussy up and down, then back in, and around and around. Jules made a small keening noise and said "I'm gonna cum," and then looked up at me very seriously, "Do it...NOW!"</p> <p>I held my fingers still inside to delay my eventual climax, and took her right hand into my mouth and licked and sucked on her other hand for a little longer before sliding them back out and bringing them to my mouth to lick off her juices.</p> <p>She kept working her pussy on my fingers, and she kept saying, "Do it's my pussy. We'll do it."</p> <p></p> <p>and I kept fingered her to my fingers to the lips, she leaned to her, but up to her and kissed, and her pussy kissing—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
