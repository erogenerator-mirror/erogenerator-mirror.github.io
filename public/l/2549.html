But we've all seen how many things I can make them do, and I knew I could come up with something that would make them all feel like a woman.</p> <p>Oh, I don't know why boys need to have all the fun. I've been known to make them enjoy it if they had a certain way. I've even been able to get them to do things they weren't supposed to be doing, even though they were afraid they wouldn't want to, and that, if they weren't careful, they would eventually get the pleasure they were supposed to have. I've even got them to use a little vibrator in their butt to turn them on, and I don't think I did that on purpose - not that it was any more fun than fucking my boyfriend in my pussy, but it was fun nonetheless, and for a change, I really didn't like doing it on my own - and it would have never happened either.</p> <p>But for a change, the fun was never gone by that point either. The only reason I could come up with a more original approach was because it had a certain power to make them feel like a real woman - and maybe more than a girl. I know it seems a contradiction when you think about it, that I've said men are always going to fuck each other's girlfriends instead of their own girlfriends, but that has never stopped a man from going with women and getting fucked. It's not so much the thought of getting a turn in a women's ass, I'm sure, because if you want to know the truth, you'll have to ask me - and as far as being caught by a girl's boyfriend with your strap-on inside her ass is concerned, well, being an ass slut sounds a bit more than being fucked.</p> <p>What men didn't realize, when they first saw those two girls in their bedroom, was that we still had a way to make a girl feel special.</p> <p>There always seems to be an endless line drawn in the sand when it comes to learning to be a girl, but if you really know what it's like to be someone's girl, and if you even truly know what makes a girl special, I'm sure a lot of you just want to know the truth. All you need to do is ask. Be brave, and do some exploring if you want to try it. Don't just stare, because your mind isn't really good at it. But look at your own body, and see if you like the way I feel when I'm inside of you. Make a conscious decision to trust each others minds. That might be hard, so just try to remember the line drawn in the sand when it comes to the right person.</p> <p>That's when everything can get pretty crazy - all you need to do is try to remember that that one line in the sand is only a line. The way I feel right now, it makes it all the more difficult - if you try to think of something else than what you really already know it makes it easier to focus on just one thing at a time.</p> <p>To get to know one's own body better, just trust what you feel, because you've done so much since coming home for Christmas, and you would be amazed at how much you want to. That's all we have to do - to start here, when we get to know each other better, even better, and it's time to do some practicing so that we can really know each other better, when we've got all our clothes laid out here. It's okay if you have to go to the bathroom, but if you don't want to get cleaned up from your shower, why don't you come back up here and wash yourself? Then you know that it doesn't really matter if you go or go only if you do it after you leave; if there's one thing that can't be done without, it's just to go.</p> <p>If you know what you're doing, use your hand to wash some of that nice lotion off your chest, then run your hands all over your body, or slide your hand down over your tummy, then do that again. If you just put your fingers in your pussy, while doing that, then just run two of your fingers up and down your lips. Think of a finger between your lips, because when you do that, just push it in deeper. Then run it up and down, then down and up and down. Think of each with your fingers going and down, you come, right, right, right, you should keep that's right, allâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
