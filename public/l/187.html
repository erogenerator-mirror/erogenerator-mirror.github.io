Knights and Squires.</h4><p><strong>The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a Quaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy coast,</strong> he was not entirely of religion, and he also was a devout citizen of Massachusetts.</p> <p>It occurred to Starbuck that he could have fallen for the whole thing. He couldn't have imagined not having been caught. He didn't even know if it was a big deal. But he didn't care; it was the right thing to do.</p> <p>The guy's name was George and he was a very smart fellow. At least, that's the way he made himself feel.</p> <p>The whole reason the Pequod was born was because of the man.</p> <p>The Pequod was not particularly high-level political science, and neither was this guy. What the hell made it into an institute that we are actually into?</p> <p>As the name of the guy had come up in the early days of the Pequod, Starbuck felt a certain amount of pride. He believed it was his first choice of subjects. A pequod of the highest magnitude, it came from his faith. All humans are sacred. And that was the only reason he chose to attend the Institute of Contemporary Art.</p> <p>If he'd only seen the guy that day, his pride would well have been for the best. So he chose the guy.</p> <p>Starbuck was surprised by the look on the guy's face. He never expected such a handsome guy. He must've taken the guy for some sort of alien, because it looked like his smile became wider. It looked so strange, like his teeth were sharper. It was as if no color matter for them.</p> <p>Starbuck had to have known the guy would be like, really good at what he was doing. When he wasn't, he was like, "Holy shit, that's fantastic!"</p> <p>To Starbuck, it wasn't the greatest place in the world to be, anyway. The only thing it looked like was his eyebrows. And the most fascinating thing about the guy was that he was really funny.</p> <p>The guy looked like something out of a cartoon. Well, not a cartoon, really. It looked like he just got turned on by the look on Starbuck's face. He was breathing hard.</p> <p>Starbuck looked the guy up and down. He didn't think the guy was pretty.</p> <p>What the fuck was this guy doing in the first place? His nose was so close to Starbuck's mouth. And he must have caught Starbuck staring at him.</p> <p>"Starbuck, meet a fellow of the Pequods." A voice said. Starbuck had been mesmerized. All he could think of was the Pequods.</p> <p>"Hey," said Starbuck, "What do you think of the fellow?"</p> <p>"You know, you look like a man."</p> <p>It was the voice that made Starbuck feel uncomfortable. He felt so awkward and confused.</p> <p>"Um, thanks. I think I do. Well, I'm not exactly the brightest kid in the Pequod system. I'm a little too old for the system, but I don't really have a lot of experience in that thing."</p> <p>Starbuck, to which Starbuck was more than willing to agree, wasn't convinced that the fellow was the man that would be the man in the pequod. But he was so damn stubborn and so damn good-looking that he couldn't stand for some other man to get into the wrong house.</p> <p>The other guy was, however, the one and only man that could possibly fit in. And he was the best looker.</p> <p>This guy seemed like an all-day sucker. He always seemed like a guy. Every time he came walking by, he gave Starbuck a look of indifference. It didn't help that the other guy was wearing a hat to disguise his eyes from the sun.</p> <p>Starbuck took off his sunglasses and looked himself over. He wasn't what the hell he said he was. If it wasn't for being an all-day sucker, he'd be more like the Pequod in disguise than the guy who was supposed to be the Pequod.</p> <p>In any case, just now, they were staring at his face. The Pequod hadn't come to the Institute of Contemporary Art, and neither had the man.</p> <p>To Starbuck, that look was still odd, even now. It was more like the look of being a little boy, just like he was. He felt stupid because he was.</p> <p>"Come on," said the third guy. But after a second, he turned to go. There was nothing about him. No makeup to show his pretty face off. He just looked like a man. The other guy turned to Starbuck was, in fact.</p> <p></p> <p>There was a small and large, blue green skin and blue eyed down as the one blue, Starbuck. But blue. Starbuck felt the other, Starbuck like blue was yellow-â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
