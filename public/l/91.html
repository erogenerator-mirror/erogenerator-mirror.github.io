Advice from a Caterpillar</h4><p><strong>The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid,</strong> yet knowing tone.</p> <p>"Are we ready?" They both wanted to fuck.</p> <p>When Alice finally spoke up, her tone reminded of that famous line she'd written for the song, "In the dark," and that's what she had in mind. "Let's start with a bit of a quick prayer," she said. "It was a long time ago, but I wanted to have some fun for a change."</p> <p>She stepped off of the platform and moved over to the first man in line. He grinned at her appreciatively while Alice took the bait. She knelt down in front of the first man in line, and took his cock into her mouth. She licked a line from his tip, down his shaft, and then sucked on the head. The line was thick, of course, but what really impressed Alice was the amount of precum her lipstick made. It tasted like lemonade. When she made sure she had him in her mouth completely, she pulled off the man's cock and pointed it at Alice.</p> <p>It made Alice happy to be the conduit of inspiration. Having a cock in her mouth made her warm, wet, and gooey all at once. It made her feel wickedly happy to be a willing participant.</p> <p>She got him to lie on the platform and she sat back over him. Alice got it on with everything she had, and she didn't know why: the feeling of having this man's tongue exploring her exposed lips, tasting them while he licked her clit and fingered her, but it was all a new experience for Alice. She was always the dominant one, and with a guy - who knew his dick would be ready with the need to be lubed and fucked - she enjoyed it. And being horny felt good.</p> <p>"That feels so good," Alice said, and she pushed back and forth with herself. She squeezed her breasts, and ran her fingers over her nipples as she sucked the head of the man's cock.</p> <p>When Alice felt a little more of her magic touch, she stopped sucking the cock immediately and let the guy enjoy her. She sucked on it slowly at first, and then used her hands to massage the soft skin of his cock. Her mouth opened in rhythm to the sucking sounds from her mouth, which just added to sex.</p> <p>"Mmmm," Alice moaned, when the man's tongue made its way down to her clitoris, but this time, the guy couldn't help but lick her and make her moan with pure arousal.</p> <p>"Oh, god," she said, when he ran his tongue over her clit at first.</p> <p>While fucking the man with her mouth, Alice was feeling the heat and excitement of her climax. That, combined with her horniness, was a powerful experience, and she couldn't help but scream with pleasure as he continued to lick her clitoris.</p> <p>"Don't cum!" she yelped, when he used his index ring finger to rub against her g-spot while holding on to the top of her clit with his thumb.</p> <p>The man kept on licking her, pushing his tongue into her pussy until Alice's climax came. When it finally subsided, he pulled her down close. "I want you to have an orgasm. Come inside me."</p> <p>A few seconds of silence. Then she took one of his hands and guided him to a spot inside her pussy. "Do you wanna be inside me? Do you wanna fuck me?"</p> <p>"Do it," he said, even if there was some reluctance.</p> <p>He pushed her onto her back, and while she spread her legs, he looked on intently at the gaping pussy. Her swollen outer lips were swollen, pink, and slightly swollen inside a hood. He leaned over, and he licked her from the top of her clit down to the tip of her vagina. When he got to the tip of her clitoris, he kissed it softly, while his tongue rubbed and stroked it.</p> <p>"Like this," she murmured, while he brought her to three orgasms with his tongue.</p> <p>"Yeah," she whispered.</p> <p>She spread her legs wider, exposing even more of her intimate parts to his gaze.</p> <p>"Oh yeah," he said, and he pressed his head into her. He wanted to make sure they had plenty of time to enjoy each other, but he didn't want anything to interrupt it. And he needed to make himself satisfied. "How is this supposed to make me feel?" he said at last, and he kissed her clit slowly with his lips while he ran his tongue in long, slow circles around it.</p> <p>"Oh, I love," she replied. She started to roll her legs in the air and spread them even wider, feeling him against her sex opening up her labia. In the warmth.</p> <p>"Fuck," he felt his cock, "it," he saidâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
