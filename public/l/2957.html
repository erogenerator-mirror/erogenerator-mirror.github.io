The land was divided amongst the other Tribes (Levi</strong>, Levi and Levi). Their purpose was only to protect Israel, and not prevent the Jewish Empire from being destroyed.</p> <p>In one of these places, the man, being a priest, was a handsome man, about fifty with a beard that would surely show its age in the darkness of the night. His hair was long and had wavy tendrils of black to frame his face. His nose was very feminine, but his face could not have been more pleasing if he had a bit of a nose. His eyes were brown, although quite pale, and had dark shadows in them from the night sky. The face itself was of a perfect blend of man and female, except that he had a sort of penis, which had a little more foreskin. The penis itself looked very much like it's owner's penis, and seemed to be a little larger and wider than the owner's. The penis itself had long, wide, dark hairs of the same color, but in their place a thin covering of brown pubic hair, so that you could see the penis was not so pronounced any more than the owner's penis was.</p> <p>He stood to the side, not too close to the ground. "This is my wife, Rachel," he said. "And I am your first husband, and you will be my first husband together." He pulled Rachel towards him, who was still on her knees. "This is our first time together," he said. "We will be married later. I was surprised at having a chance to be on the front steps with the woman I loved."</p> <p>They kissed. Very gently and very, very, very slowly. As lovers it was the first time that Rachel's tongue explored the lips of another lover; at the end, it had penetrated her mouth, and been the object of passion for many a year. When his tongue touched hers, she felt an electric shock go through her body. She sucked on it as best she could.</p> <p>"Let me," she said, and put his head between her legs. Rachel put her hands round his neck. She pulled him away. "No, just lie on your front," she told him, and lay on all fours.</p> <p>As if in a trance, he sat on the ground next to the prostrate woman, and looked at the woman. He looked at the dark hair covering her pussy. The hair was slightly damp, as Rachel often had on the bed when they were in bed. "The sight of her pussy has aroused me; its scent and taste is really delicious. I want to put my cock there. Please make me come!"</p> <p>Rachel was excited beyond words; she just couldn't do it. She reached round and touched his flaccid cock. His cock had become all the more erect, and she started to move her hand up and down. "It's all mine, Rachel," she said. "You're the only one on earth that can make it big. I want you to come. Now!" She got to her knees to take the man's penis into her mouth, which she did with considerable patience and skill, all the while squeezing her own nipples. She liked it when she enjoyed it this much, in her case she was in no hurry to come. She enjoyed giving a man pleasure. To do this, she could concentrate on the pleasure she felt coming from it.</p> <p>After a while, and after Rachel had sucked him off twice, the man lifted the woman up and rolled her over so that now he was kneeling on him. His penis was still as hard as it had been since before they had got married. Rachel smiled at him.</p> <p>"Let me show you," she said.</p> <p>Rachel reached over to the bedside table and opened the drawers, taking out a tube of lubricant. She lay back on the bed face up and raised her legs to give his penis access to her pussy.</p> <p>Rachel spread her legs a little, and placed the head of his penis between her lips. This was not the first time that she had seen her husband's penis, and she was sure it was the first time she had felt his organ. She squeezed him as best she could, then looked at him. He was looking at her with fascination, waiting for her to tell him what to do, to make the first move, to make him come.</p> <p>Then she gave him the tube of lubricant and moved her legs to one another to help him enter her properly. Once he was inside she pushed him towards her in, and he came in.</p> <p>They stayed like that a moment, then Rachel lay back on the bed. She rubbed her hands on her body, which was still in the dark. She touched her nipples. "This is how my breasts used to make love their owner come; I like I used them. But it; I gave to love me. I gave to make them too."</p> <p></p> <p>She opened her breasts were a few tears.
