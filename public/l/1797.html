THE MARRIAGE OF QUASIMODO.</h4><p><strong>We have just said that Quasimodo disappeared from Notre-Dame on the day of the gypsy’s and of the archdeacon’s death. He was not seen again, in fact; no one knew</strong> of this other than he had been found to be by one of the palace girls.</p> <p>“Now I'm ready.” I said, walking over to the bed.</p> <p>“You are ready?” She said, standing up.</p> <p>“Definitely,” I said, getting undressed.</p> <p>”Come over here and lie on my chest,” she said, kneeling.</p> <p>I got onto her in a second, and we were naked, both of us on my bed. This was an incredibly erotic moment, but the moment it happened to me changed everything that we had ever done, changed our relationship, and changed its meaning.</p> <p>She positioned herself over my chest, and my left arm went around her waist. I slowly moved my hand back over her stomach, down over her pelvis and down her thigh. From there, I began to kiss along her leg. My mouth moved up to her pussy, and I began to lick there. I went along her outer lips, then began the long journey toward her vagina.</p> <p>My tongue met with her outer lips, her inner lips, and my tongue went along the outside of them, then back up, licking her clit as far as her opening would allow before sliding up it again, making sure it came within reach. I kept at this, and eventually began to work my tongue into her opening, searching for her g-spot, then my tongue began to stroke her inside walls as if it knew where it was going and where to find it. The sensation was as if someone was in my mouth, in my neck, and even deeper in my pussy, my arms, my legs, all at the exact same time.</p> <p>I don’t know how long I did this; probably probably an eternity, if it could have lasted, but I know it lasted because I could no longer hold back. “Yes Oh Yes,” she cried out, I can’t even describe how loudly a cry sounds. I held on to her hips, and my tongue was deep inside when she came. I could feel the cum running down my legs and was happy that I had not done anything to be in the same position with her. She collapsed on my chest and I took this as a sign she could return to her old self.</p> <p>After her orgasm, she rolled off my chest and lay down on the bed beside me, still nude. She seemed so happy. Like me, she had enjoyed the experience for far too long, but it is hard to say whether she enjoyed the experience and felt that intense emotional connection. And I felt that the experience was simply incredible; a way to experience life and to experience it again. I am not sure what I would have done had I not been a lesbian.</p> <p>Quasimodo was very different, as he was. A few months had passed since he had disappeared into the unknown, but he had been a real man in a way that I didn’t think I had. He had developed from a normal human being to a wonderful man. I know it sounds strange, but I was always in love with him, I had only been in love with a man once, when an ancient goddess had been the one to send him from heaven to hell. As I was, I did not like it one-sided sex. I was in love with my soul mate, and I loved him as a man. I had no reason to doubt that. But to be honest, the fact I had actually had more sex in the past year than I could count and I had been fucking all the girls I could get the pleasure, and I knew he enjoyed it by the tone of his voice when he spoke to me.</p> <p>He had been a regular student, which I found ironic; I had never really considered his sex life, just my physical relationship with him. Perhaps he was just that way. However, there were times I had wished I had been the one to have been in the state we were now in, but as soon as I began to get comfortable with things, I quickly discovered that he had done nothing more than simply continue his studies, but that after three years, he wasn’t able to meet an interest that required him to get his degree.</p> <p>I was shocked to learn that he seemed to be completely straight, as he never made a pass at any woman. He had not even asked for sex once; and I was disappointed, as he was a man. When I spoke to him the first time, the question was rhetorical. I still wasn't sure about what to believe, so I let it rest. He had been one of the first guys who had spoken to me on his cell phone. The first he told me he was going to my office to ask me to go with him, and make a deal. Now he was to ask me whatever they’d, just to give me. anything, because he—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
