Each of these six men was as though he had been struck. But with Silver the blow passed almost instantly. Every</strong> man had it. It was a perfect fit. This guy. His cock. Silver was that man from that magazine article on the planet Earth.</p> <p>He fucked me right there. And he fucked me long and hard. His hands grabbed my hips harder than anyone had before. Not hard enough to hurt but enough to move in a way meant to punish me. He would fuck me in that way. And as I became used to that, I became used to the fucking. My orgasm started in slow motion but quickly built on itself. My pussy contracted around that cock so hard it drove Silver out of the universe. But his cock couldn't escape in my pussy. Not then. Not after. Silver knew that. And as it exited it was followed by his. And as it exited he was met by the cock that would never leave my pussy. He held that dick like a weapon. His hands were hard. He used them to guide me on and off of it. In the end he controlled me. He had control of every move. Every thrust. Every motion of it. Every part of me. Every thought was controlled. Only his cock controlled me. The only thing that was allowed to remain with him was his body. No pleasure. Only pain. Only power. Only possession. And only what any woman is entitled to.</p> <p>I was the sex puppet I always felt like. This was what it was all about. The sex. The power. The lust. The power. The power. This was all he wanted. All he needed. Each and every thrust. Every movement of his body for his cock. Each move of his fingers for his mind. Every fucking move I had to give myself. This was all for him. I was his to use. He wanted to own. It was a powerful and empowering feeling. It fed his desires. It fed his desires. He wanted to share with me some of his love.</p> <p>I was just another person who gave into to his power. Just what I was and I thought it was to be. This man knew what he wanted, when he wanted it. And with every thrust he was pushing me on top of him. And every thrust I was pushing him on top of me. I knew what I was doing. I knew what I needed. I knew that he was my slave. I was now his sex puppet. I was still his sex puppet. This time I was his toy. He had power over me. His sex puppet. His sexual puppet. He controlled me. All I wanted to do was to be his sex puppet.</p> <p>And with that in mind I began to suckle on his cock. Like a baby should. I sucked. And I sucked. And I sucked. And I sucked. I didn't know that anything in life could give this pleasure to a man as much as a woman is receiving pleasure from a cock sucking. But it was too late to do anything else. And I was the sex worker he wanted to be.</p> <p>With one hard thrust, he shot his load in my mouth. Some cum leaked out of my mouth but he wouldn't let it go. He grabbed two handfuls of my hair and guided me to suck him harder. He loved it. But some of his sperm still leaked down my throat. And I swallowed. My mouth filled with his cum. I knew what I needed to do. I would suck his cock until he didn't want to be let go.</p> <p>Then he picked me up, carried me back to my tent, wrapped one arm around my waist, and pulled me in. My body took over completely. I moaned as I felt the length of his cock inside of me. There is nothing more that a woman knows to make a man moan. This one man was so fucking good. So good. So good. I was feeling my pussy filled with another man's cum. A second pair of cock inside of me. I wrapped my legs around him. I knew what was going to happen. I knew what I needed to feel right. To feel his body. It took me over the edge. I sucked on his cock again. And I sucked on his cock. And I sucked his cum in my mouth once more.</p> <p>We lay there for a bit holding each other. And I finally pushed him on his back. My pussy was full of his cum. As he looked down on me, he said... He doesn't love you. I know this. I know that. We can't, shouldn't let go of each other. But he loves me. And he loves me now. And he will always love me. If he wants to be with me, I won't be with him. I think that's what he needs to do. To love me. So I will love him. This is only the beginning. That's the beginning of a new beginning of a new relationship. I am the new.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>He was reading of my life with the man andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
