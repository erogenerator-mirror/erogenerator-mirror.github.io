All in all, Jesus Christ has given me guidance in so many ways.</p> <p>If you wish to find out what these ways are, then feel free to email me with these things for my sake. The way it will please me, in giving you your knowledge of the ways of the Christian Church, will also please you.</p> <p>Your Lord and Ladyâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
