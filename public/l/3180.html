They were accepted. Siddhartha gave his garments to a</strong> servant, while his parents gave their dresses to the two young men. They left.</p> <p>In the morning the two boys arrived at their new home for first official visit to school. Though they had already graduated, they were to study science and to take study and work on various important projects, including the study of the scientific method. In the evenings they took their studies for relaxation while others were required to sleep. The first few nights were of study and study and work. They enjoyed each other's company, even the sex. After a while they had decided to spend the night in an empty suite. They enjoyed each other's company. He wanted to kiss her and she wanted to kiss him, but she would have to sleep with him; that was her duty. For most of the day, during the days on which they were staying, they spent much time together. She took more pleasure in fucking him. But whenever she felt he was getting tired he had to leave. He could do that in the evening and the whole night. But for one night only he was ready to go on duty while he slept and she gave herself to him. It was the last day that they had spent together, so they finished the day separately but each went further than that by one night, together before they slept.</p> <p>That evening after work on the couch, he had sat in a corner while she had taken his clothes off. He had been hard ever since she came to the door wearing just a single garment. He had wanted to touch her but she had made him wait, while she left behind her clothes. He had wanted to do the same, but she had made him lie on the couch. She had fucked him again and again, in her room, when they made love. She had also fucked him in their bed.</p> <p>At the next school day, when the students did their homework at lunch time, she took him with her. At home, she wanted to make love with him. She always had loved him. They fucked in the kitchen while he was working for bread, milk, sugar and eggs—they didn't even need to make breakfast. He always loved her and always wanted to make love with her. He loved her taste. He loved her smells and her hair and her lips. His pleasure was always more than his satisfaction. Now he took her and fucked her. All the time they were together he loved her even more.</p> <p>Siddhartha had spent the day in his room, as was her habit. He was fully erect, after some hours of fucking, so he fucked her more often. He loved her, because she loved his cock and that he wanted to fuck her again. At the end of it, when he came inside her, she wanted the same. She didn't fuck him hard, but she was content with her fucking.</p> <p>He gave her his house. There were also other houses in their neighbourhood. They were always busy with work and school. And there were others. When they visited them often they had to take things away for work.</p> <p>Siddhartha's house was also full of women. But he saw them with joy all the time. There were many girls among them. He had to have more of them.</p> <p>The night after classes, the two brothers went to his room. They were naked, lying on the cot. His cock was still hard. He didn't know what to do. They had a few orgasms in each other and he loved every minute.</p> <p>After they had fucked together, they took turns sucking his cock until he ejaculated in her mouth.</p> <p>Siddhartha had always loved when he made love to each of the women before they went to their room. They went everywhere, in their bedrooms, in the study, and even their bedrooms. He had always been sure that he preferred that to fucking. She didn't know that he was too shy or that he didn't like her. They were always going to love each other.</p> <p>He had already made love to some of the women at school—the ones with the most attractive but they had always avoided him. They did everything he told them to do. That way they wouldn't reject him.</p> <p>So his first fuck was with a woman who gave pleasure even to him because of his cock. He had already made love with many of the women there already and he enjoyed the pleasure as much as he enjoyed it—and enjoyed having his cock in their asses—even when there were other women there that he didn't know. But he was now in his own house. A new woman who also loved making him hot and made him feel pleasure too, was his new neighbour. She lived close. When he knew that she was also to be his girl. As he felt the pleasure too. Her pussy was his special to be his friend.</p> <p></p> <p>It was the next morning.<: She had to be that they had finished the day. He waited.< She did—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
