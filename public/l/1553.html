English by Fyodor Dostoyevsky </h3><h4>CHAPTER V</h4><p><strong>“Of course, I’ve been meaning lately to go to Razumihin’s to ask for work, to ask him to get me lessons or something...” Raskolnikov thought, “but what help can he</strong> possibly know about sex?</p> <p>* * * * * “He’s right,” Raskolnikov had told his friend, “If you give me sex in an ordinary situation, I’ll certainly not try to fuck you.” “He’s probably talking to your wife when he does it to you.”</p> <p>As he pondered this, he felt another pair of hands gently rubbing his cock and balls and then his lips, as yet unknown to him, slowly kissed an engorged cock head. And, as the fingers slowly slid up and down his stiffening cock, his head was gradually pulled back. And then he felt another and then another, slowly and firmly pushing his cock into someone’s mouth. And then, the hands continued with their gentle caresses, squeezing his balls and sliding up and down his shaft until he felt as though his legs had been lifted, and a cock, a cock that filled his mouth, was being gently pushed back into his throat until it bumped against the back of his throat.</p> <p>Raskolnikov’s head was starting to spin and his heart was pounding. He felt the cock withdraw almost instantly, and then he felt a warm mouth begin to slide down his shaft, sliding around his cock-head, and then, a warm tongue slipped down and began licking at his balls, rolling them around.</p> <p>Raskolnikov didn’t know whom or what the tongue was, but it’s a mystery to him, and when he felt the warm wet tongue slide down his ass crack, and begin to gently suck his balls, he felt his cock slowly sliding into somebody’s mouth.</p> <p>“Oh, oh, fuck...fuck me...” he screamed. “Oh, God, fuck.”</p> <p>After a few moments of this, he’d had enough of the slow blowjob.</p> <p>And then, he felt pressure around his cock as someone began to stroke his balls again. Oh, God, did it feel good! Raskolnikov imagined that the mouth was pumping him, and that his cock was being gently squeezed, stroked, pushed and stroked. And the person was slowly sliding him deeper and deeper into the hot, wet mouth, kissing and licking and sucking and stroking his cock, as yet unknown to him, yet as his own cock was being slowly guided and slid in and out of the warm, wet cavity.</p> <p>“Oh, my God,” he thought, as he felt his cock sliding back and forth into his friend’s hot, wet mouth, “I can’t hold it anymore, it feels too good.”</p> <p>Involuntarily, he began to thrust, meeting this gentle assault. His cock was being driven hard and fast within his friend’s mouth, and then, his balls were tightening, and his penis was swelling, spurting and spurting into the mouth he was being sucked on. And then he felt his whole body begin to tremble as, at the same time as his body went rigid, the cock pumped his hot load into the mouth he was being stroked around the shaft.</p> <p>After what seemed like moments, his orgasm finally subsided and his shrinking cock dropped out of the mouth he was having it off, and the lips pulled away with a smacking sound. Raskolnikov lay back on the bed with a satisfied look.</p> <p>A moment later, his friend and partner came back to the bed. He could still feel the cock as it slowly slid out of his body, and he was glad that he had just made the decision to go to a man who was a lot like himself in that regard. They had to at least try to find something with which they could compare to the others, though. And he’d not lost the way, so they couldn’t tell if it was the cock he was just sucking, or the taste.</p> <p>“Well,” Raskolnikov said, “that was the first time I’ve ever eaten pussy.”</p> <p>“How was it?” his colleague wondered, and then added, “You were marvelous! There was so much to learn, you’re incredible. What do you think about that idea, what I’m hearing?”</p> <p>Raskolnikov smiled. “I’m going to return to the States to see what comes of living on the planet, to keep myself. You know that what I’s just happened? But,”</p> <p>Raskolnikov agreed, then walked out of the bedroom went in search for his clothes, turned for clothes, and walked, went into the hotel. Raskie, saw something nice clothes. heck a very interesting, so—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
