English by Fyodor Dostoyevsky </h3><h4>CHAPTER V</h4><p><strong>This was a gentleman no longer young, of a stiff and portly appearance, and a cautious and sour countenance. He began by stopping short in the doorway, staring about him</strong> with a weary and weary eye, as if he had just finished chewing someone's ear, and then turning his attention from the ceiling, and moving to the bathroom to return all of it to the open kitchen door.</p> <p>He'd already turned up the thermostat to 80 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit, and turned it to half-mast, as she was turning away from the mirror, and he began undressing himself after a quick kiss to give her a sense of what he had to offer. Standing behind her as she turned the water running, and turning the temperature up to a decent ninety degrees, as she pulled off her jacket and threw it aside; he looked over her shoulder at the mirror and thought, with a slight frown, if her skirt was even a bit more scandalous than it ought to be; he reached out for her, and she began to unbutton his shirt before he was fully undressed. As she pulled his shirt out and over his shoulders, and tossed it aside, and began stroking his chest and stomach with both her hands, he'd already undone his belt buckle, and her fingers wrapped around his already stiff cock.</p> <p>"Oh—oh, Daddy," she said when she came across his hard cock—but was already smiling because her hands couldn't get away from him. He kissed the back of her neck affectionately while she stroked his dick with both her hands, and he ran a strong finger lightly down her spine with just the tip of his finger. And he felt her soft and smooth sides of her ass cheeks—he could even tell that she was going to bend over to take his cock up her ass—and she could also feel the moist heat and moisture coming from his balls. He felt a bit of her wetness as well, which he felt from her fingers along his balls too.</p> <p>And there was another sensation also his way, but not nearly as bad as the first. It felt good enough that she could bend over with her ass still facing the mirror and her breasts right in front of his dick, and he could have a good view of her breasts too as he imagined she looked at him. He couldn't believe that in all the times we shared the bedroom together, she'd never gotten completely naked, and in all the times he'd had her standing close by while he was watching, he'd never watched her take a shower; he loved the way she could turn around in a way that he always thought so beautiful, so sexy if she was standing facing the mirror topless in front of the door all the time.</p> <p>"Oh, my God," he whispered while she was turning around in the bathroom, the image of her in the bedroom on top of the mirror making it hard to think straight—which could have been very difficult at this point. He loved every moment of the intimacy of it. And he was thinking to himself, "Daddy, this was wrong"</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she moaned as if in the moment she'd just stepped out of a shower, as she reached back and gripped her ass cheeks wide open and squeezed them as she moved the water from the shower to the toilet.</p> <p>"You're such a beautiful, sweet, sweet baby. So beautiful," he said while kissing and nibbling her neck and shoulders, while sliding a few fingers between her thighs while stroking her clit, making her cry out a bit before she was fully standing up, while holding the door while the water turned off and the water faucet shut. His eyes were fixed to the sight of her standing in the doorway, her eyes looking past them a bit when she looked into his eyes, and they were still closed.</p> <p>Her eyes were opened to look through the window into the kitchen. "Daddy, are you here?"</p> <p>He didn't answer, just lowered a quizzical eyebrow while moving forward and hugging her from behind. "Daddy?" she asked.</p> <p>"Oh, baby, I—"</p> <p>"Come on in—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
