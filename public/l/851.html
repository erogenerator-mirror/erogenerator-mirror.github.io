We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when</strong> Mr. Reed offered to pay) was almost ready, we went to a local coffee shop, where the food was exceptional. We laughed, enjoyed each other's company and ended up having coffee with some hot, tasty, exotic coffee in a large, soft, open-faced coffee shop on our way back. We got in and the conversation turned to men and their cocks. We were the only ones who could say that we have been with more than one man, or both.</p> <p>There was an odd sensation of unease at the memory, but it was mostly the memory that came back.</p> <p>"I'm sure that I'm fucking you right now," said Mrs. Reed.</p> <p>"Do you?"</p> <p>"No, I don't. Would you like me to show you?"</p> <p>"No, I don't think I would like to"</p> <p>"Well, you don't. I want you to fuck me now."</p> <p>She was already sitting on the sofa, on her knees, waiting for him, naked, still wearing his bathrobe. With her hands behind her head, she leaned back on her elbows. He looked at her long legs, over her knees, and up her thighs. His cock was rock-hard. She was smiling again, and opened her mouth to speak.</p> <p>With my right hand, I reached out an index finger and caressed his right eye. His cock jutted from his body, like a snake, straight and long. One hand held her left hand, while the other stroked her clitoris, which poked up from the shadow of her pubic hair. His hand reached to his mouth and started to lick her wet clitoris. His cock continued to twitch, and his tongue went back again and again. He got his right thumb and index finger on her exposed clitoris. His fingers danced over her, and a finger, like her mouth, went back to her clitoris.</p> <p>"Are you ready for this?" he asked. She shook her head no. He moved towards her, and she pushed him on to his back, and kneeled between his legs while on top, while kneeling on his stomach, still in his bathrobe. She straddled him and looked at his cock for a second while she rubbed the head again, then leaned forward. Her tongue, which had not come yet, tasted the head again, licking it, making it lath some more. His dick was pulsing. She lowered her head toward his balls and sucked his right ball into her mouth, then her left, the first of his many balls in the fleshy sacs of balls.</p> <p>Their mouths parted and he gasped when she looked up at him, and his mouth fell to hers. He wrapped his hands around her waist and pulled her tight against him, while her tongue entered his mouth again, licking, playing with his tongue. Then she started to suck her tongue and put her hands around his dick, stroking to its throbbing, pulsating length. He put his hands in her hair, and fucked her mouth, slowly, just like this. She was still kneeling in front of him, and her hands went back to squeezing and pushing and kneading his thighs.</p> <p>"Are you going to come?" she whispered, a moan coming in.</p> <p>The sound was very sexy and the wet sound was making her body quake. His dick was throbbing a little too much for her to suck, but she continued to suck until she put her hands on his thighs and started to bounce on it. Her lips pressed against his dick on each up-stroke. She closed her eyes and leaned against him, which made her nipple rub on his belly and touch his belly flesh. He was still pumping her wet pussy when she moaned and gasped.</p> <p>"Oh, yes! I am going to come!" she breathed.</p> <p>Then she moaned, and it sounded like a squeal. Her body jerked, and she squirted for the second time on his chest and, his hands on her, she came again. He could see her body shivering and shuddering, while she held his head, as if on a high. Then she put her hands back on his belly and lay on him, and her face to his chest.</p> <p>He was lying. He did not want to come yet. He looked up at her. She was smiling. She kissed his face and nose softly. She put her hand on his chest.</p> <p>"I will always make you cum?" she asked.</p> <p>All he could say was 'yes' to this.</p> <p>She kissed him on the mouth again, and said, "I'll take it up to our next meeting." her. . She got up from the table, kissed him and lay down on his body, her knees before her own naked, and kissed him, in her hands stroking him, his dick again and her pussy.
