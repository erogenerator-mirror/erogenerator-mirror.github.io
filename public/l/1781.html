DELIRIUM.</h4><p><strong>Claude Frollo was no longer in Notre-Dame when his adopted son so abruptly cut the fatal web in which the archdeacon and the gypsy were entangled. On returning to the</strong> castle, he found an old, worn out bed and a half empty cupboard, but he thought it had all been a nightmare, and he found himself sleeping in his grandfather's bed.</p> <p>He woke the next morning to find the bed made all the more so when he felt someone pressing down on top him from behind. He woke when his hands were restrained above his head, and his hips were turned upward. He felt something hard being pressed into his butt.</p> <p>He felt someone grinding against his hard cock. When the pain registered for just a moment, his own mind flashed between waking fully and being reminded of everything they'd been missing in just their brief but insistent presence on the bed. He remembered having heard a few women in his life describe their first time; most were no better than him, even if they were talking about his sex life. He remembered telling a woman that he didn't think he could handle a night without the sex. She'd been surprised, as he found out. That was all it made him. He woke to the sound of a slap coming from the bedroom next to theirs. It wasn't that he didn't like his own bedroom, it was his own life, but he wasn't going to complain about it. He moved his hips, feeling a wetness seep from between his legs, and he felt himself stiffen when she did it again. She really did need to try something else. He knew it was because they'd been so busy the last few weeks, and he didn't wish to spoil that.</p> <p>Someone else's cock slipped into him, but he pretended they wouldn't. He didn't care where they fucked; it was enough the way he thought of it. He felt a cock in his mouth and he swallowed it. Something heavy pressing insistently against him from behind, something hard inside. He found a way to roll his hips so the cock inside his mouth wasn't pressed up against his body; he could hold his mouth against it while he sucked.</p> <p>Someone else's hands were touching his body again, sliding around and gripping. He thought he could see a shapely thigh touching the curve of his hip between his legs. He felt a nipple stiffening against his hand and he felt someone squeezing his balls hard.</p> <p>Someone else was fucking him. His hips were rocking wildly, pushing back against the cock that was pounding at his ass.</p> <p>Someone was pulling his cheeks open. Someone was fucking him hard and fast. Someone else was pulling his hair. Someone else had his cock in somebody else's mouth. He knew something was going on, but he didn't know whose it was.</p> <p>But a cock was pumping into his mouth and his own hips kept moving, rocking wildly and pushing back into the cock that was filling him, fucking him, stretching him. It was all going to be enough to make Claude Frollo fall apart, to make him break apart from everything.</p> <p>He felt the warm fluid splashing against the sides of his mouth and over his tongue and the lips that were gripping him. His hips moved more insistently than he wanted. Every part of him wanted to let that cock slip out from his body, to come back. To empty the cock into the mouth the way other cocks had filled. Instead, he sucked faster, moaning and sucking harder.</p> <p>Claude Frollo heard the sounds of voices outside, a group of people making their way down into the bedroom, voices and talking. He couldn't hear his own voice, but he knew he was fucking a man in the shower, watching his father's son giving him a blowjob. Someone was screaming and the head of his prick was being pressed tight against something hard, his balls were being pumped harder than they'd ever been and he was feeling a thick strand of semen hitting the end of his penis.</p> <p>Was Claude Frollo cumming inside the mouth of his father when other voices were in his head? Was he really cumming inside another man's mouth while he sucked on his father's prick or was someone else doing it?</p> <p>Claude Frollo felt the cock in his ass start to jerk. He sucked on the cock deep down and was surprised when it pulled out to let him breath.</p> <p>When they were done, someone else had removed his balls from under his balls, and he was sure he could feel some of that wetness dripping from his dick when he sat up. He held the thick, wet cock in front of his nose, the head shiny and wet, the skin tinged pink, and even though the tip was all shiny from his mouth, even through the thin layer of his pre-cum, there was a clear liquid coating the cockhead.</p> <p>almost as thick as it was, even as much as it was covered the skin of her hair on the head. Andromacolia, they were her, even if she and evenâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
