THE MYSTERIOUS MONK.</h4><p><strong>The illustrious wine shop of “Eve’s Apple” was situated in the University, at the corner of the Rue de la Rondelle and the Rue de la Bâtonnier. It was a</strong> very old building and it had been renovated into a large glass and wooded area. For the past few years there had been many parties, but one of the larger parties of the evening had been thrown by a couple. They had decided it would be much easier to get drunk and then celebrate with some of their own after that. The couple, both in their mid-ties, were also celebrating their nineteenth anniversary.</p> <p>They had invited the man and woman that had been married for nearly nineteen years to the event. At first they had been hesitant to do anything but a double take on the size of their celebration. There was a small pool inside the windows and they found it to be quite good. The woman had come to the party, got the beer and brought along some wine as they drank. The man had brought a blanket, some cushions from the furniture and the blanket but no booze. As they were dancing the man turned on a CD and they all came to the pool room for some sun. It only had one chair so the two of them decided to sit in the one opposite the wall. Their arms were around each others necks as they embraced. The man’s arms around her waist and her arms around his waist. And both of them were feeling the warmth in their bodies.</p> <p>They were in a circle and they were rubbing along the length of each others nipples occasionally, enjoying the warmth. The man had his hand on his girlfriend’s breasts squeezing them, pulling and rubbing till she was squirming under his touch. She was rubbing her thighs. She didn’t object to that at all. She was rubbing her pussy as he squeezed around her. She could feel him getting hard. Her hand was wrapped around his cock through his pants. She was getting so much pleasure through it. He put a finger inside her and started rubbing her clit. Her body was so warm and she knew he was excited too. She didn’t move but pressed herself forward to him, kissing him on the mouth and his ear. As she was pressing against the man it was so much easier and he was so hard and they started pressing each other’s sex organs. It had not even taken a minute to go through the roof for her to get herself sufficiently hard. She wanted him to go harder and harder till she climax.</p> <p>The man started fucking her, first a little bit at first but then a lot harder, till they were moaning all the time. It was so long since she had been made love to like that. They both moved together till they both came again and once more as one until both of them were exhausted.</p> <p>After one of them had finished fucking the man she had just made love to. She had turned around and had him sucking her boobs. He had her sucking his nipples and she had his balls in her hand. And she had him cumming in her mouth. They had both finished and cleaned themselves and went into the hotel to leave the party at that moment. And the man had left.</p> <p>The rest of the day was spent together with the others. It was a couple of hours before the evening was done and before they left. They had some drinks and sat around until the evening’s meal and drank some more. Some of the wine had made him quite drunk and he wanted to go back to his room. The couple had brought a couple of bottles with them and they left by a corner table in a semi-private area of the hotel.</p> <p>They had a couple of more drinks and the woman had put some more lotion on herself. She started rubbing the lotion in with the guy’s shoulders and then down to him waist area until they both started rubbing her thighs. He was getting hard again at this level and had to put one of his hands on her tits to make her hard nipple go up a little. They kept rubbing till they touched each other again. After a while the man’s hands had wandered down to her ass and rubbed both her thighs. She had put a bottle of lotion on her butt and squeezed a lot onto her anus. She had started rubbing lotion on his cock and they both started fucking her ass hole. They had never done that. Both of them came in their hands and took a good bath together.</p> <p>After the bath they took another shower together and when the water got cold they went out to get something to eat. They went to the bar and had some snacks waiting in the bar. The bar was very busy with people eating and drinking so there was no possibility of anything interesting happening. So they had a snack and sat down and watched the people go in and it.</p> <p>After a while long the bar, the man they were hungry and was having a walk outside shower they had found the spot where there were dancing and so much more customers with lots of other people were standing on some and and then the couples and the couples. So they had a dance music in the dance floor—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
