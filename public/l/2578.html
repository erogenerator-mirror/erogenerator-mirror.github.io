But even for a man's right to choose this position: by the will of God, the human body has a certain right to choose to do without the right to choose, and the human body does choose to choose.</p> <p>"When do you go?" I questioned her.</p> <p>"In the month they pass," she responded, with a smirk of a smile.</p> <p>"It's a long way," I stated.</p> <p>She shook her head, but her eyes never left my erection. She reached down, and with a slight push, slid her hand down to my pants. I had to hold myself still, as the feeling of a hand on mine, on my cock, almost made me come just thinking about it.</p> <p>As she continued, even through my underwear, to unbutton her bra, I asked her again, "Do you usually dress like this for other people?"</p> <p>"Sometimes," she replied. She took my hand, and placed it on a breast.</p> <p>"Is it nice to make yourself happy," I asked.</p> <p>"It's nice in a way," she returned.</p> <p>"I like to feel what you are doing," I encouraged, while rubbing her nipple.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she nodded.</p> <p>My other hand joined in playing with the other breast. Her breathing became heavier as her grip became more heavy. One of her hands released mine, then went to the front of her pants, while giving my shaft a squeeze, and then pulling it down. Her mouth opened, and with a sigh she unbuttoned her jeans. After her pants were open, she quickly removed them. She pushed them down, leaving her panties covering her, and pulled my hand to her, taking it in, guiding it where she wants it to go.</p> <p>"Oh! You're so beautiful," I exclaimed from her actions, while rubbing her clitoris, which she clearly can, and is. She pulled on my hand a couple more times, pushing my fingers into her. My other hand massaged her boobs, pulling and squeezing them.</p> <p>Her breathing became more rapid, and I felt her start to sweat, and let go a bit of her self-control. "Oh! I'm coming," she exclaimed a few seconds later, her body twitching all over.</p> <p>"That was great," I exclaimed, as we pulled our clothes back-up and went back to the bed, sitting there.</p> <p>This time, it was the day my wife started to have a change of heart, and that I had a similar one.</p> <p>I turned my back on her, as she tried to get dressed. She gave up, lying there, her breasts jiggling with excitement.</p> <p>I left my clothes on the bed beside her, and went to the toilet. After emptying it, I stepped into the shower, and joined her for the shower, where she quickly took my cock in her mouth. I was just about to come myself when I felt her legs wrapping around my waist. She wrapped herself around me, holding on to my ass tightly, as she moved her hips as she came on me. I felt her cum-glistening lips slide up and down, taking the cum inside, coating my shaft with wetness. She didn't let up, as the hot liquid of the shower was pouring down my shaft, as she came again. My entire body shook. Her hands slid down to her breasts, as in between her legs, cupping my cock, as she came, her cum drenching me in a layer of wetness. This time her body had another change of heart, and her breasts were dripping. They were a perfect mass of pale, milky-white flesh.</p> <p>"I'm going to take you again, this time," she gasped, when she came down. She had made a mess, and I saw that her pubic hairs were now soaking wet from her excitement. I reached out with both hands, as I pulled her up toward me, my erection pressed against her vagina. She pushed her hips back, as I entered her.</p> <p>"Oh!" she exclaimed, kissing me on the lips, once we got inside of her. We took each other to a new world of pleasure that neither one would have guessed existed, and were not ashamed to do. It was only right, to let it go, and not to resist it. We wanted to do this together.</p> <p>I kissed her, and moved her to her bed, before coming back to her. I lay on top of her body, to give her room, and began to fuck her with long, hard strokes, with one hand wrapped around her clitoris clitoris breast, fingers around the nipple, and my lips. Her hand caressing her breasts, feeling the other hand, squeezing, while we fucked, I sucked or played with her body. She made me, on the body.
