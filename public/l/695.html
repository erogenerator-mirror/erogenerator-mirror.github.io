Denísov started these and Pierre was particularly agreeable and amusing</strong>. We drank the whole glass and I could have come right then and there.</p> <p>After we ate and had been drinking for a while, we all took off our shoes, took off our pants. "I'm going to take a swim," said Nicholas, kissing his toast. Pierre and Denis didn't need to be asked for permission. They stood next to me. "I can't believe how much better you are," said Denis. He gave me another kiss.</p> <p>We stripped and I saw that there was a bigger difference between kissing a man and a woman than I had with Richard and my husband. This was sex, with a capital S (s) behind it. What did it mean to you, Pierre, that it was so much better than it was with Richard? I smiled.</p> <p>"I need to go for a swim," said Pierre in a sardonic tone.</p> <p>While Denis and Pierre stood in front of me, I dropped to my knees to kiss them. The differences were there in their expressions. I was pleased that the two were attracted to me. A couple of kisses and a quick tug of the hand. We all went into the water, paddling around the edge until the sun came up. We changed partners, Pierre and I naked and me in a bikini. We went back to the beach. Pierre and Denis kissed and fondled, while Nicholas and Pierre stroked me. I had to admit, that Pierre definitely turned Pierre on. We were standing up when Pierre said to me, "That's so hot, the way Pierre's doing it, I want his cock, but I'm pretty close to it."</p> <p>I laughed. "You know, Pierre, I don't know if I'm pretty close to that. I'm sure my pussy and ass were a close match when he was here. You're going to like it."</p> <p>Pierre nodded. I knew he was right. The swim turned us on, Pierre to be more of a challenge. I liked it. He wasn't wearing much. I got the feeling that, in his condition, it wasn't very long at all. Pierre had other things in mind.</p> <p>When I came out of the water, there were three of us standing there. The three of us looked at each others with a kind of mutual admiration. I walked up to Pierre as soon as I got there, and the water and water came flowing over me. Our bodies touched as I went back to Pierre, with Pierre facing me, taking my breasts and playing with my nipples. Finally we both took the time to look at each other.</p> <p>"I'm pretty hot, too," said Denis. "The water feels good."</p> <p>Pierre went right behind me. Our crotches were against each other. I felt his hardening cock against me, against the opening to my pussy. I thought I might cum right then. If I touched myself just right, there was no going back.</p> <p>"You're as horny as me," said Denis. "You're already wet for me."</p> <p>"Oh, yes!" Pierre said. His cock became even easier to see.</p> <p>"How did you know that," I said.</p> <p>"Yes," said Pierre.</p> <p>We kissed. It looked so nice, so arousing. My pussy and ass were getting warmed up. Pierre and Denis started kissing with French, not as just a normal couple, but as lovers, but as two men. We kissed for a long time. Pierre pulled my bottoms off and I sat on the towel. I started to slide my bikini bottoms off.</p> <p>"Not you, Pierre," I said.</p> <p>"No," Pierre said. "When I was younger, you were the only thing on my mind." He was kissing me gently, but not seriously. His tongue was licking my lips lightly. He tasted really good.</p> <p>Pierre reached for me. I turned around. He helped me to bend my leg a little so that I was lying on my outstretched foot. That way, he could go deeper, lick me. His tongue was going straight for my pussy. I was beginning to realize he was going to eat me that way.</p> <p>My legs went up a little until they were bent at my knees. I spread my legs a little farther. He took his hand, dipped his fingers into my slit, and took my clitoris between them. I moaned and moaned. Finally Pierre's tongue touched my clit for the first time and I could really feel it—as if it were his tongue. I felt like I could come any time. I started to come, but Pierre held onto my clitoris for a while and gently nibbled my pussy. When my body started to convulse and jerk, Pierre held me. I screamed out of reflex, it did. The first one, then the second, as many times. Pierre continued like that, then every time like that. I'd orgasm—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
