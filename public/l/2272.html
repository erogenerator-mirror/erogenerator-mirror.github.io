No mother could have</strong> taken her daughter away from her; her daughter, as a member of the gang, proved to be a better fighter than she pretended.</p> <p>Her daughter was born, she didn't believe, and never came back to the compound. She never saw her mother, she was away, in exile.</p> <p>Two weeks before the last visit of a member of the gang, Mrs. Linton took an extended absence home. The leader's daughter did, but she was also away. She was in her family's business and couldn't go to school. She would be lost among her peers.</p> <p>Mrs. Linton made a vow to herself: She would go with the gang whenever she was needed, and only to the gang's special location; she would stay at that location and spend her whole life in peace.</p> <p>The gang traveled the country. Every week it went out to meet with its members. When it came back from its trip to the region her mother knew she would be there, surrounded by the gang.</p> <p>The trip included a special trip to the village called the Luchar's Castle. The city had its own special town, and as soon as its gates were opened she was called in. She saw the whole village and the place.</p> <p>"It's as good a place as anybody could be. This is the town of the people," she said and she rang the front bell. Two young policemen stepped into the front room; Mr. Gaunt, her father, entered the room. He had heard many jokes about the Luchar's castle, so he took notice. The three policemen stood before her.</p> <p>"Ah yes, the city is full of the people," said Mr. Gaunt. "So this village, the Luchar's Castle, is all they need." He said then started to remove her clothes.</p> <p>She wore only her shoes and a robe. At the moment she had the man of the village in her mouth; she felt the man's breath on her neck and her hands stroked his penis. After that, the man put her robe on her then stepped aside so her two men could continue her. He took her by the hair and guided her lower body with his hand.</p> <p>She didn't feel the man's weight, nor was she aware of her surroundings. He took her hips and gently pushed her down to the stone floor. She didn't think she could go without the pleasure. She heard the music, the smell of the city and it brought her back. The man, the leader, grabbed her chin and gently turned her head.</p> <p>"You know, dear cousin, one of us can do things that I'll never do." He said in his soft voice. He held her face between his hands.</p> <p>She could smell the man's skin, the man's musky odor. She felt his hands around her body. She could now feel the soft warm skin, and could smell the man's strong scent. She opened her eyes slightly, and to her right was just the wooden top. Her arms were being held by her two men at her breasts. The man, the leader, took his erection and slowly rubbed it before pressing it in her vagina.</p> <p>"Look," he said, "there we go." He pulled her robe again.</p> <p>She could now see the men, their muscles, hard cocks and their bodies. She felt the man's penis rubbing on her vulva and she could feel him moving his head in her vagina. She liked that, very much. She had never been felt like this. She closed her eyes again.</p> <p>He put his penis in her mouth and she sucked. She licked the head. She tasted his semen and it excited her. She could feel his strong smell on her lips. The taste was wonderful and soon his penis was in her mouth. She could feel the tip of his penis on her lips. He had no idea how long he was going to be in her mouth.</p> <p>"Now, your turn," said Mr. Gaunt. He grabbed her and pushed her onto her back in the stone floor. She had a look of terror on her face and in her eyes. "You are going to take my penis in your mouth." He lifted her legs, placing them on his shoulders.</p> <p>As she bent to take the man in her mouth she remembered her life in France. She remembered how she was first there, where men raped women and used women as sex tools.</p> <p>He forced her head down to his penis and forced his penis in her mouth.</p> <p>"You were going to put your tongue up my penis," he whispered.</p> <p>She didn't know what to do. "I, I don't want it. " .</p> <p>I didn't. The man didn't want it " I didn't it, I'm nothing " he whispered. He said and she smiled. Her</p> <p>she said.
