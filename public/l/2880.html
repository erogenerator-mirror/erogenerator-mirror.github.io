This was my time, time to shine. Time to take my clothes off. Time for me to take my clothes off.</p> <p>I pulled my pants and boxers down and stepped out of them, standing naked in the doorway, naked in the sun, stark naked in the cold-glanced light of the Christmas tree.</p> <p>I wanted to look at my cock, the one I'd had in my hand all night, and not the one I'd just left so long ago.</p> <p>I looked at it, my cock. It looked so good. I'd already been dreaming of feeling it, running it up and down my shaft, feeling it, feeling it. How did you do that? Do you make love to a penis? You've never been able to make love to a guy. You've never had a guy make love to you.</p> <p>Or better still, you've had no experience.</p> <p>But I loved every inch of my cock.</p> <p>As I took in the wonderful spectacle, I took it into my hands and, for a few seconds, I enjoyed it again, as it happened again.</p> <p>I liked the idea of having made it come to life. After I'd felt I made myself come, I took my cock out, and looked at the shaft, which was already starting to lengthen, then, after I'd felt I'd made good to it, I wrapped both arms around it. I loved it all, and I loved the idea even more.</p> <p>It came to life and grew, almost like a huge piece of fruit, just like Christmas morning.</p> <p>The moment I touched it now, it came hard, hard, like a big banana, and it felt warm in my hand, like a big cock, and it was warm, like a warm, wet pussy, and I was in love with that too. I had to feel it, if I could touch it, I could touch my cock, or stroke it, and feel it, and fuck it and fuck it and fuck it.</p> <p>I pulled the foreskin back over the head, with my fingertips, and looked at it again, like a mirror, like someone examining a car. I looked at it with pleasure. I wanted to see all of it, I wanted to feel it.</p> <p>I ran my finger down the underside of it, and down from the base of the shaft back, and then, over and over, over and over until, almost immediately, I got a taste again, tasting it.</p> <p>It was warm. Warm and wet, with lots of precum.</p> <p>It tasted kind of good. Sweet. And I loved the fact that it had turned me on to feel it, that I had tasted it.</p> <p>I wanted more, I wanted to give it all. I wanted to make it all come together. I wanted to make it come hard, in the way of my tongue, inside the warmth of my mouth, in between the warm lips, up and down the shaft.</p> <p>"Oh yes. You're going to make a woman cum today."</p> <p>It's not like you can't tell anyone about this, of course. Nobody knows that you actually do it, and everyone will know the same, and everybody will know how good it feels to you, for your skin to be stretched, whether it be in the sun, a night in your bed, in your shower, on your back, in the kitchen, in your basement, your room, and even outside, as a man's woman, inside her, in the warmth of her body.</p> <p>You'd get lucky. You'd watch and masturbate, watching one of your wives get off. You'd be watching her walk down the stairs at the end of the day. Watching your wife on her knees, licking a wet, glistening goo out of your cum, while another man comes, inside her, inside your wife, the way you like to see her give you her cum.</p> <p>That's your gift, of course.</p> <p>As if it was your gift, in the way it was before, I was feeling all this pleasure again, and I wanted more. I wanted to feel every inch of the shaft, every inch of the head, from the root to the tip, in one hand, feeling the heat and the hardness and the strength of it, feeling its power.</p> <p>But I had to know, if I really want more. It just had to feel, right before it was going to come to life inside me.</p> <p></p> <p>I wanted to hold the shaft.</p> <p></p> <p>I wanted to feel it</p> <p></p> <p>I wanted it</p> <p>There was just waiting for</p> <p></p> <p>It felt so good, so good</p> <p></p> <p>I didn't know</p> <p></p> <p>'I loved itâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
