Of him that brought me up, not to be fondly addicted to either of</h4><p><strong>the two great factions of the coursers in the circus, called Prasini, and Veneti: nor in the amphitheatre partially to favour any of the gladiators, or fencers, as either the</strong> royal or majestically attired the other. But for now, the king's plans began to unfold slowly, his actions, and acts.</p> <p>The king entered the chamber, flanked by the majestically attired Prasini and Veneti, his cock dangling freely, his eyes gleaming, his hair a rich crimson color, his lips curled suggestively, her body was a deep, dark colour, the veins of her breasts bulging her small, pert breasts, the dark, red-coloured mons veneris.</p> <p>Sister Vincenzo: she was only twenty years old, a mere half a year shy from being a princess, her whole being was focussed on the princess who was her future, the one who came to rule the kingdom and be ruled by the king, or, more, by the king who chose to be a prince of the country.</p> <p>As the king entered the chamber, standing behind the princess, and kissing her neck, he lifted her by her chin. She was taken aback by this, but then realized that her role was to play the prince, not to be the prince. But she already knew this, and understood that she had to take that role seriously.</p> <p>Her eyes widened, and her knees spread as she looked up at her king, her lips parted, a flush spreading over her cheeks. The king pressed her chin again to keep her face in place, so as to ensure the princess had an unobstructed view of him. The princess was completely taken with this, her heart fluttering in her chest, her heart racing as her mind registered what he was about to do.</p> <p>The king pulled her close and kissed her, pushing her chin upward with his tongue, his face pressed against her, his tongue moving into her mouth. Their kiss was brief, then filled with fire. They separated and came for her dress, ripping it as the princess, without a moment's resistance, pulled her close again and kissed her again again.</p> <p>He broke away and threw the dress to the ground, standing her in the middle of the room. Holding her face in his hands, he kissed the princess again, his eyes shining as he kissed and teased her neck. He lowered her, his cock hard, and his kisses heavy and sweet. All the princess could do was to giggle and moan as their kiss got hotter and hotter.</p> <p>Then the princess was on her back on the bed, her legs spread wide, her pussy in full view of the king. She felt herself being licked, kissed and suck, the king's cock hard on her pussy, and he was licking and sucking her, kissing her like a lover, a lover of her life and she could feel his cock, and his cock in her, both of them as one. His cock was so hard it pulsed against the princess's pussy.</p> <p>Then, suddenly, she felt his cock touch her there, and he pushed his cock against her clit, pushing against her at the same time. Her pussy opened and his cock slid into her, and as it was he pushed all the way into her pussy, his cock buried deep inside her as she felt herself being so filled.</p> <p>Soon, like a train full of pleasure, they had moved together, both moving within the other's pussy, each feeling the pleasure, a deep pleasure that they shared, sharing their deepest fantasies and secret fears and fantasies.</p> <p>They had been joined for years, but had not kissed for over a year. The first time they had kissed had been the first time either one of them had touched each other. And the second time had been the first time either one had touched each other, their hands touching, the heat of the other's sex.</p> <p>Sister Vincenzo: but she had to be told who her master would be next, didn't she?</p> <p>Sister Vincenzo: a servant, for whom the king had said she could be called, but her master would be the one to instruct her?</p> <p>The princess was stunned, but did not reply. It was true that she had to be asked this time, and to do as her master wanted her to be. So she simply said that she would answer "yes" when he said "yes" to her.</p> <p>The princess looked at the king to see how he would react, then closed her eyes, and opened them again.</p> <p>She opened her eyes to see the king looking at her with a smile on his lips, and she knew, then saw him rise up so that he could sit next to her. His hand came to rest on her thigh and she spread her legs to allow him further access. He stroked her inner thigh, and then stroked, and rubbed her inner thigh.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>and</p> <p>and the princess felt so that her pussy was so, and so, soâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
