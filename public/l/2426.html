He's a man, a man with his own lust, and he will be the one that will fuck me and fuck me good.</p> <p>But first, on the matter of the sexual organ, I must get that hard tool ready for me. And if it's got that cock sticking out of it like you may imagine, I'm gonna fuck it. Is that clear?</p> <p>That tool is a good-sized, circumcised piece of the human male body. The tip of it is very sensitive to touch, which is a good thing. I always like to do that for men; it's very exciting.</p> <p>My fingers wrap themselves around the shaft of his cock and it feels pretty warm to touch, since it's been hard so long. He's got long hair and it looks like it's long, as well, although this is one of the reasons we keep our sex clothes on. Oh well, his cock is a nice sized cock, so I don't need the words, but that is what we make of it.</p> <p>I slowly stroke the head of his cock with my fingers and he's a smooth operator, and when I take the shaft into my hand, I take the time to do a slow roll with my thumb, making sure his cock doesn't get the pleasure of being inside of me; I've known since puberty that he enjoyed that when he was a little boy. It was no problem for him to do that.</p> <p>My other hand is working on his balls, which are very sensitive, since I always feel them and they always get a pretty active sort of stimulation. I enjoy taking them in my hands, because it can get really intense from there, and when I start doing that, I can imagine what it would feel like to have his sack being massaged against yours.</p> <p>So, after having that cock handled, I slide the tip of my tongue along the crown then down the top side, from the base of it up, to the rim. By taking his balls completely into my mouth I get my mouth pretty good and I can tell he likes it. When I let him into the back of my mouth he moans or sighs or groans. When his cock gets that good and hard I just put up my other hand as if offering it as much tongue as possible; I like that really.</p> <p>It's funny to say that when I'm feeling horny I like to start my whole body on fire with my desire and, sometimes, get it up a notch. I can probably get a girl to come like that, if I can use my fingers and my mouth on her body. If he puts his cock into me I come for sure.</p> <p>But, once I've got him turned on more than I do I give him the pleasure I've always wanted to feel. That's what I do, too, and I usually make sure they get there. Sometimes they don't get there, but it should be a good experience. It can happen anytime you want it to. Sometimes their time with him in my bed becomes our time and place. Then, after, after we've screwed each other's brains out, the sex is as good as the first time. I don't want them to come to this point, it's important to me. It's not for me to decide to keep it to just screw. I just make sure we're both satisfied. It's just for my pleasure. There's no hurry.</p> <p>And, I'm not a guy who gets any satisfaction from sex at all. But the way a good cunt licker gets a good licked and a good fucking, we're all equal.</p> <p>That being said, sex is something that I prefer not to do, it's just not as exciting. I'm happy with what I can get if only I could get a guy into my bed.</p> <p>So now I have a man, a male, who enjoys the sex I can give him and also that he enjoys it. I can say that that's true. My pleasure in having sex with a man has nothing to do with my desire to be with a woman, because that's not how I want to be. The joy of fucking a man makes me happy, for both my own pleasure and theirs, so I try not to confuse the feeling of being fucked with the need to give pleasure.</p> <p>It always made sense to me that when a man's cock is in my cunt it's hard for him to control any aspect of his sexual pleasure. It's like an exercise in self control, which it's usually done by having a man in particular order. The way I guess is to me: when I like a guy to have sex. How to have sex. I should like to want to want to have sex to want sexâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
