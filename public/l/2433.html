Thus, we shall move back to the past.</p> <p>My favorite is a quote to his song in his book. I have been looking forward to this chapter for a while. It's my very favorite part of any book. It's the most recent chapter, so hopefully they'll be good.</p> <p>In case you don't read the chapter in here to know, I've been in this country thousands of years, and my book is now over a hundred years behind, because I've only been in it for a day.</p> <p>I have many other favorites too. But when you've been through with this, you should probably read the next chapter for your own personal enjoyment and mine of course is about the events to come.</p> <p>To recap, these stories happened after I had first taken possession of this house and I, an eighteen years old boy, bought a very nice home on the outskirts of town. The property had a community pool, hot tub, and a pool house. I became friends with two friends that lived just a few blocks away, and I stayed close to them during these visits. We became fast friends, and as our friendship grew, I had trouble sleeping. Not that I was trying to get into any of it, mind you, it was just sort of a natural progression on my journey to become a better person. My only concern is if I wanted to become a better lover, or if I wanted to be a better father of two children, or just be a better, happier lover.</p> <p>To be continuedâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
