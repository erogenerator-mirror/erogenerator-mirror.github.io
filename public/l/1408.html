This is because Joe had to be around 9pm on Friday, I mean, we had already had sex that night. After a decent dinner and shower, we headed out to the hotel restaurant and got into the car. I went to Joe's room to get my suitcase and take my stuff into the bathroom so he could clean up so that he could spend the next two hours in our bedroom. Joe closed his door, he opened the nightstand for a few seconds and then stood up and walked past me, I felt his hand on my ass and it felt like his finger was going to grab my asscheeks and squeeze them hard. He put his finger in his mouth and then went and got cleaned up from Joe's room, I was getting pretty tired. I walked out of my room and went downstairs and started eating pizza and looking out the window. The rest of the time was pretty much what I was looking forward to from now on. Joe was a horny guy. He was looking forward to having sex, to having a hot woman in the room. Maybe he was going to lose control and fuck me. I had to think about that! All I could really think about right now was having sex with this man and his finger in my ass.</p> <p>Joe opened the bathroom door, there he laid out the hotel's sheets and took off his clothes on the bed. He laid down his pants down. I walked over to the bathroom and sat on the toilet and peed. I took my clothes off and stood to pee. Finally it was over, I climbed out of the bathroom into the bedroom, grabbed my suitcase and took the rest of my stuff up stairs too. He had done a pretty good job cleaning and I was in a good mood and I was on the point of making out with him again when I saw him walk in the room with a small, bright red bag in his hand, as he sat on the bed. Then he took off his shoes and pulled out his cock. It was not big, not fat, not big, it was not small by any means. And it didn't hurt or disappoint either. There was no scarring or bruising. There's no sign of anything wrong with it, there's not an ounce of swelling or any blemishes. So I went ahead and sat on the bed next to him. We kissed, and touched, and tasted each other with our fingers. I loved it. He ran his fingernails over my breast and down my stomach and he found my clit and started rubbing it and sucking on my nipples. I couldn't stand it any more and I pulled away from his mouth and sat down on the edge of the bed.</p> <p>He spread my legs and licked my pussy very, very slowly. He kissed the outside of my lips until I opened them wide and he put his tongue inside. God, I came about ten seconds after he started making me cum. I held on to his head and rubbed his hair which made him feel so good. I wanted to feel him moving inside me, inside my pussy. To feel him inside something and then to enjoy having it as my clit. He licked my cunt very, very, very slowly. It felt as if his tongue was being sucked hard and he didn't even touch it. His nose felt the soft wetness of my vagina. I felt as if he was sucking on my pussy lips but I could barely feel his mouth. His tongue went in to my cunt faster and faster. He put my clit on the top of his tongue as fast as he could. I felt like an electric jolt went through out my body. I knew I was going to cum, oh, I knew I was going to cum again, all I could think was "Oh my god, I'm cumming" and, and cum, cum, cum. And then I saw his cock twitch a few times and he got off the bed to the bathroom. When he returned he held his cock at the base and pushed the head in and out for a while and then he took it out and pushed it deep inside me again. I came again, then again. He was moving his cock in and out faster and faster at the bottom and in and out of me and every time he went deep I could feel the whole length of him move in and out of me. Finally he stopped and pulled out of me. I was about to collapse and lay down on the bed.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" I was so mad. I had to put a stop to this now.</p> <p>"I don't think.... I don't think you want it." I was just too upset to argue back.</p> <p>"Not even?" I mean that it's what I wanted it isn't.</p> <p>"No it's not really." So then you." " It's I never going to let me fuck me.
