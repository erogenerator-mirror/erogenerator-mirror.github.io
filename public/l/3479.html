And of course you cannot have anything against us. Just have to keep an eye on what your students were doing on the night before the test is. Perhaps we could work on them to prove it as long as possible? But I think that is doubtful! We could wait forever to have what we want.</p> <p>You're right. So let us think. First time?</p> <p>When your class is up I'll come by your home. Then I'll call you afterwards. The teacher in charge of your study will decide the day and time of your exam, but my mind will be working with you as you study; my thoughts and my thoughts will be for you. Your teacher will decide the day and when you can pass the tests; he will give the same kind of advice to all the other boys as to what is going on; which are important: if a boy wants to learn it as he can by the test, he needs to tell his teacher the same truth as he can in the school. So that is why I will wait for you; to find out whether the teacher will come to you first, if and when.</p> <p>Yes, I can read it in your mind and I am sure you can find it very important.</p> <p>Well, how do you say you are happy?</p> <p>Thanks,</p> <p>Professor Jovano</p> <p>He sat quietly in a corner of the classroom, listening as the students said and do what he liked to do in their studies; and as he did, he felt a warm feeling spreading through his body and his groin, as though each little touch caused a different feeling inside him. He felt as though he had a small penis inside him! As they were reading they would seem to feel pleasure within themselves as the boys talked and read at a distance.</p> <p>As he waited he did the same to the girls who, as they were the most curious to him, the way they used their hands and their mouth. He could feel the soft silkiness of their hair that made his hands so warm. He did this to himself when he heard Miss White telling the boys about the 'mighty woman in the school', with her accent saying that the 'lady of course, if Miss Black got the courage to get on board' and the teacher saying that 'not only has Miss White had the courage to get on board but she'd rather that they didn't have their virginity.' And he imagined their faces were as soft as moths and their teeth as long as his jaw and his lips. He remembered Miss White's words that he should tell the men that she was ready to have his cock, that they should put a finger inside her, and, as the boys watched with eager anticipation, he should ask Miss White to suck his cock too. And the men were sure to ask him if Miss White had seen any of his class. All this time he had been doing all this to himself, while being controlled.</p> <p>He imagined she wanted to suck him and so he should ask; Miss White, Miss Black and he, the teacher, the teacher, whatever she wanted him to ask. Miss White's voice broke through his own thoughts. Miss White would certainly take control of him. 'You could ask Mr Toldy if Miss Black went to the school.' And she would suck him and she could suck him as if he was a man! He imagined her taking his big blue penis in her mouth and she would be sucking and licking him very, very softly. In his imagination her big white lips felt like hers and he did not feel at all embarrassed. He must be a really special case! Then he remembered Miss White's words, 'Be a man when ever your man pleases you Miss White.' and he could have a thought with no fear of it affecting him. His thoughts were just as intense as they had been, just as vivid as they could be. He could imagine their eyes as big as luscious moths and their teeth as sharp as his own: if anyone was there he would be able to feel the softness of their teeth as his fingers touched their hairless teeth. He would feel the warmth of their breath as the fingers passed their teeth. He imagined kissing her there and sucking her, like a fine wine. But he knew he would feel even better.</p> <p>'So you want to be a man?' he pondered, as he remembered that he had not had time to think on this very thing, because he already knew that Miss White, being Miss Black, was already very sexually active!</p> <p>'I don't know,' Miss Big white likes Miss Black likes Miss Black as well Miss White as Miss Black and Miss White would you as Miss Black as Miss Black and be a man' he be I was Miss Black my man.'
