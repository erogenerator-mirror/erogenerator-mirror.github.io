In the middle of the gathering at the old house, he and Mrs. Bennet lay on his back, and he held onto a pillow, while he fucked her. She looked at him and smiled. It was very sexy. He looked at her.</p> <p>When he could take it no more, he was on top. She was sitting on her son's shoulders. When she felt his cock enter in her, it was as hard as stone. They both grunted, and then they were going at it again. He looked at her face but not his cock. He looked at her eyes. He looked into her eyes as he fucked her. It was like the beginning of a movie night.</p> <p>At least, that is what was happening with Mr. Collins, and that's what they were after. They looked at each other and laughed. It was like nothing they had ever done before. They did it with a laugh. They both did it together. There was nobody else who knew. It was like they were talking to each other through their thoughts. It was like they were the only one in the world who loved each other, and they were the only ones whose love for each other had any limits.</p> <p>They fucked, and they fucked. His cock got really good in Mrs. Bennet's pussy. There was lots of her. There was lots of him. He fucked faster. He fucked her hard. They fucked until they couldn't move. They didn't want to move anymore. It felt like they had done everything. It was nice. It felt good, when they were doing it. It was exciting.</p> <p>Mrs. Bennet didn't remember anything. When she opened her eyes, she was looking at Mr. Collins. There was so much pleasure, when he was doing what she wanted. She enjoyed it when she wanted. It was like a movie except that Mr. Collins was on top, too, and taking her from behind, like a man. Mr. Bennet was in a sixty-nine. She could watch himself eating her pussy out.</p> <p>She liked that, too, when he was in a 69 position. It was very exciting. The whole scene of their coupling was very exciting. He was on top, with one hand massaging his balls, while Mr. Collins was fucking their daughter from behind. At least it seemed that way. As she watched it happen, it made her really happy. It was so exciting. Just about every minute, she would enjoy that as much as any time she did this. When her husband ate her pussy, it made her feel so alive. She loved it. And as he fucked her from behind, she loved it as much as she loved it.</p> <p>She wanted it more than ever before. And he did too. They fucked, but they were also talking to each other through their voices. They were communicating each other through their words. It felt like this was really what was supposed to happen, just like it was, instead of just taking a walk in the park or whatever.</p> <p>When Mr. Bennet's cock began to swell, and it made his balls swell, and then his seed began to spurt out of the tip, and spray all the room, the entire house, and all the people, for that matter, who would think would care.</p> <p>It was just like last night. It was like they were just fucking. They fucked like that every night of his life. It was just so wonderful and sexy. They both did it together. They fucked and they loved it.</p> <p>When it seemed like their bodies would never stop, and no one would ever know that they were fucking, they were fucking. It felt so good. It was so fucking good. They were fucking. There was nothing else except the pleasure they were enjoying.</p> <p>It was one more, more fantastic moment for both of them. It felt so good, and it felt like they were fucking again. It felt perfect. The moment of a moment when both of them were on the edge so long without ever getting there, and for a whole long time, they both did it together. There was nothing else but making love to each other. There was nothing else except them. There was nothing more than love.</p> <p>That moment was perfect—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
