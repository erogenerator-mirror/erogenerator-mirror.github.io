English by Fyodor Dostoyevsky </h3><h4>CHAPTER II</h4><p><strong>“Ah these cigarettes!” Porfiry Petrovitch ejaculated at last, having lighted one. “They are pernicious, positively pernicious, and yet I can’t give them up! I cough, I begin to have tickling</strong> sensation.”</p> <p>“Oh baby, that’s nice!” Petrovitch patted the bed beside him. “Let’s continue on.”</p> <p>The bed springs began to shake. “Oh, baby!” Petrovitch exclaimed, “this is so nice! How about a little kiss?”</p> <p>The bed began to tremble once again. “Oh, I’m so very, you know, so nice!” Petrovitch whispered, and a couple of kisses were exchanged. One more and they were done.</p> <p>“I need this cigarette!”</p> <p>“No, honey, it’s too cold for that, it’s all I had to smoke last night!”</p> <p>“I have to wait.” Petrovitch sighed. “I just want to breathe, but I have to get off because I gotta rest.”</p> <p>Petrovitch went over to the bathroom, where he took his clothes off. His penis still looked like a flagpole, but it had grown to its normal size. Petrovitch watched, fascinated as he stroked his foreskin and watched it bounce up and down. After what seemed like hours it came to life again. The tip of his cock was swollen and red. The foreskin was pulled back as he got up on his hands and knees. Petrovitch moved forward until he was standing in the middle of the bed, his cock still in his hand.</p> <p>“Here!” He said, and Petrovitch knelt on the bed between his spread legs.</p> <p>“Ooooohhhh,” He cooed, “it looks sooo good!”</p> <p>“No, please!” Petrovitch pleaded, “don’t hurt me.”</p> <p>Petrovitch knelt and his cock stuck out past his belly. “No!” He said, still watching but more from the window. “I’m just being careful!”</p> <p>“Please don’t say anything!” Petrovitch sobbed.</p> <p>“Well, you know I should, but now I just’ve got to give it some more loving attention, and I want to take it right here!” he said, and began running his hands along its length. Petrovitch’s cock grew once again, and he saw it rising even harder, and soon he couldn’t help but thrust his hips forward and his cock hit the end of Petrovitch’s cock. “Hey! What are you doing? Don’t you see? There!” Petrovitch grabbed hold of Petrovitch’s cock and it immediately stopped.</p> <p>“I just have to see what it looks like.” Petrovitch said, and he began to stroke the big red cock.</p> <p>“It looks so, it’s so, I, it’s so big and fat and swollen!”</p> <p>“It looks pretty big, doesn’t it, and it looks so, I don’t, I don’t care!”</p> <p>“Oh, oh, oh!” Petrovitch moaned.</p> <p>“It just looks so, sooooo big and, ah, it’s, ah, my, my, my cock. It just looks so, so, you know, soooo big! It’s, I mean, it’s so much, I mean, I just love it, it’s so beautiful!”</p> <p>It did look beautiful! Petrovitch’s cock stood straight out, like a sword, and he held the big cock in his hand like the sword he had seen in the butcher shop. In his mind it was a sword at the same time. It was the sword of the man whose life she wanted to spend at last. It was the sword of the man who had been her father and the man who had come into his life for the life she had given to him, who had come into her life too, and who had come into her life to have his way with her.</p> <p>After a moment, Petvitch reached down and grasped the cock in his hand. Slowly but gently, he began to take it into his hand and up. It felt good, like a big, but very long sword like a sword, sword, sword, snake of sorts. It felt real snake that it must come straight. Petv, straightened cock. a sword. All. Petrovry.’s, like a sword, or something. Petv,and all sorts. A, a snake or snakes. “s long—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
