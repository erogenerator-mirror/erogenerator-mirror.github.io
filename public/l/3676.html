Before Mrs Croft</strong> left her room, he was walking along the street with his cock waving over his thighs. When he entered Mrs Wentworth's room, it was already 9:00am. With just a couple hours of time to go, Anne woke up at 3:00am. She decided to stay awake on her back. Mrs Wentworth was already in bed, so she opted to wake up at 3:00am. Then she took a peek at her clock. She was still fast asleep, and there was no doubt her mind was already on the Captain's cock. Her eyes were on his face, so she couldn't tell if her gaze was on his eyes, or if his big fat lips were smiling like a Cheshire cat.</p> <p>She decided to check his mood when she got up. There wasn't anything but a happy little smile on his face. While he slept, she felt her mood rise. However, she was already planning to leave him. She turned herself around and went to her bedroom. She closed the bedroom door and went to bed.</p> <p>Before she went to sleep, she looked at her bedside clock. Just before she went to sleep, she sat on the bed and looked at her bedside clock until she saw the 3:00am news. If that were as happy as his smile, she had no doubt he would be lying in bed before she could say anything else.</p> <p>The Captain was still in front of the TV, not realizing they were lying next to it.</p> <p>"Ohhh, Captain Wentworth," Mrs Wentworth said as she gave his penis a light squeeze. She kissed him on the cheek and then returned the favor for his lips. They kissed all the time they were locked in a deep kiss. When they broke, she smiled and then went to bed.</p> <p>"You've got a very nice cock," Mrs Wentworth said as she held her phone up on her bedside table. "It's not hard today, is it? You don't want to get a hard, hard erection every time you say a name or call me, do you?"</p> <p>"No," he said smiling.</p> <p>"No?" she asked as she sat on her bed again.</p> <p>"No," he lied.</p> <p>"I said yes, you can't tell?" she said teasingly.</p> <p>"Oh, no," he lied.</p> <p>"What would have me thinking that there was something wrong with me?" she wondered.</p> <p>"Are you even wearing underwear?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes," she said.</p> <p>"Is that OK, Captain Wentworth?"</p> <p>"What makes you think I'm going to put on a pair of panties or not?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she said as she smiled. "When a man wears a woman's panties, the man's going to sleep in them, right?"</p> <p>"Of course," he said hoping that he might be being honest with her. "In their own home, they'll know that they're home."</p> <p>"Well, let's go and get dressed!" she said as she stood up.</p> <p>She stood up, then walked towards the front door. A moment later, she walked down the street and started walking into her own apartment. However, that time of her own journey did not end there. She was naked again. He got up from the bed and then he started to walk towards her.</p> <p>"What makes you think it's going to be OK that you're dressed when I wake up?" she asked him as she pulled the shirt that he was wearing out of the shirt pocket.</p> <p>"My girlfriend," he said smiling as she undid the button of her trousers before slowly starting to undress her.</p> <p>"Mm-hm-m Hmm?" she said as she undid the button and then started to remove the zipper.</p> <p>"But you don't have to wear panties," he said as she pulled her skirt up her legs. "I don't think you would wear panties in your own room."</p> <p>"I don't think you would wear underwear in your own room," she said as if that was a bad thing.</p> <p>"But you're wearing a pair of underwear," he said.</p> <p>"Do you want me to change my mind?" she asked as she started to undo the button and zipper of her trousers.</p> <p>"You're going to get it right this time," he said with a look that said she should take the time to reconsider.</p> <p>"And it's not going to be all night or anything?" she wondered. "If it is, I mean that I'm going to my girlfriend or no," she wondered.</p> <p></p> <p>"Mmm-Well, I'm going or she thought, I'm going," he said.</p> <p>I'm going." I'm not."</p> <p>"I'm not going and I'm going or a," and said," isâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
