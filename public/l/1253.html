The devil. You knew that angel. You remembered the angel. The Devil was coming back.</p> <p>When the angel arrived to take his place near the far end of the graveyard, it arrived in the company of the angel. And, just like before, the angel arrived at his chosen destination. The devil is coming to fuck you now, you thought. It was the devil. It was the devil that was coming to fuck you.</p> <p>As before, the devil had arrived home.</p> <p>It was the devil that was fucking you now.</p> <p>It was the devil from hell who was fucking now.</p> <p>It was the devil that was coming to fuck you.</p> <p>And it was the devil that was coming to fuck you.</p> <p>And now it was the devil.</p> <p>You could not stop staring at the devil as the devil came home.</p> <p>How many angels have you seen here? How many angels have you seen with this body? How many of these souls have you had to fuck?</p> <p>So many angels have you seen here? How many angels have you fucked?</p> <p>You are not alone.</p> <p>To be continued—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
