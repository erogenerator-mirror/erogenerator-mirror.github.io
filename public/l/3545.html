He could not make up his mind how to do</strong> it, but the idea of her being in the bedroom with him made him feel both uncomfortable and excited that he should say it out loud. When the first of the words came from his very soul, he tried very hard to keep his lips form the same soft and gentle shape, as they were when he did it with Emma. When the next word came, he tried very hard to keep his mouth formed the same soft and gentle shape as he did in bed. There were many other things he desperately wanted to say to her, but he also badly wanted desperately to tell her the truth.</p> <p>His heart was racing, because he felt the same way.</p> <p>It was then that he realized how far the truth might have gone down, if only he could get into deeper and more intimate details. The truth was, when he heard about other people fucking Emma in the bedroom, he had really gotten turned on, and his cock started to throb. The reason why all of the times he had heard about this, had, to him, was that he wanted, no, needed to hear her voice when she felt him thrusting in to her mouth.</p> <p>The only thing he really knew, was how to describe how they were feeling when they came together, together in a climax together, when he was thrusting into her mouth, while her tongue was swirling on his cockhead and his ball-juice-hole, and how she felt around him when he thrust into her asscrack, while he thrust into her pussy, when she arched her back and her toes curled, as they both climaxed together, with his cock exploding in to of her mouth and pussy, and his balls emptying, as she cried out to her orgasmic climax.</p> <p>"Ohhhh fuck!"</p> <p>"Fuck! Oh! Fuck!"</p> <p>"Yeah!"</p> <p>"I feel it," she gasped, and he couldn't hold back anymore. "Don’t stop! Don’t ever stop!"</p> <p>The next thing he heard was, "Ahhhhhhh!"</p> <p>He could not hold back any longer either, but his mouth was forced to move into a silent line and his lips found hers, while his eyes opened his mouth wide to receive everything it felt.</p> <p>"Yes! Oohh that feels so good!"</p> <p>Her lips parted over his and she pulled his head into her, as she felt the pulsing of his cock as it started to shrink, before she wrapped her lips tighter around the throbbing shaft, and sucked it as close to his own mouth as she could.</p> <p>"That was so wonderful," she thought, as her hand ran up and down his cock, as she wrapped her arms around his head, hugging him tightly to her. "That feels soooo nice."</p> <p>"Oh Emma!"</p> <p>"Oh fuck!"</p> <p>"I want you so much," he managed to whimper. "I want you so much too!"</p> <p>"I’m sorry," she whispered to him, before sucking him back into her mouth. "I mustn't let you go," and then she pulled her mouth away from him and looked him in the eyes.</p> <p>"No!" he said, as he held her chin firmly just long enough for her mouth to close over the head of his cock, again.</p> <p>"No," she said quietly, as she slid down his body, to her knees, facing him.</p> <p>Emma lowered herself to her knees, as her mouth moved down his body. She couldn't help but take a peek at how much he liked her. She took a deep breath as she did it and her tongue darted out to lick and gently tease up and down the inside edge of his cock, as her hands explored his body, over his stomach, and then she put a hand on his cock.</p> <p>"Please, let me take this off," she begged him softly, while her lips moved up and down in a steady rhythm, while she squeezed him between her soft fingers. "No!"</p> <p>His protest was incoherent as she slid her tongue across the underside of the crown of his cock. He tried to think fast. He tried to think the words out. He wanted to tell her that this was better than being with him, but he couldn't. It was hard to think without making love to her like this.</p> <p>When she touched her tongue to the top of his cockhead, the first time she had ever done anything, without stopping her movements, he gasped for air. He could feel the spasms of his heart through his cockhead, as well as her finger gently sliding over the opening to his ass. He had a vague idea what was about to say that to Emma, but when he thought it, but he hadn't but just because it really the truth that his brain.</p> <p></p> <p>she could be a bit his cock would feel the tip of her finger was that is why—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
