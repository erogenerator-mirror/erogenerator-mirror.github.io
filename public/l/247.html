The Tail.</h4><p><strong>Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope, and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial, I celebrate a tail. Reckoning</strong> I've spent every weekend on a planet with beautiful feathers, what's the use when the feathers are gone?</p> <p>It's my time now, with a few thousand years to go. That's all I want to do. I want to give this world a night of beauty and celebration. Let's go have some fun:</p> <p>A-You can feel the softness of my eyes as I make my way through the forest, toward the woods, in pursuit of a lover. We begin.</p> <p>I can feel the softness of your hand as it slides between my legs, gently caressing a swelling bud as your fingers massage my body. A moan escapes my lips as you pull my pants down. We feel my excitement, as our bodies move in a dance, as I can feel your hot breath on my chest as you kiss up and down my neck. I can feel your hardness through your pants. I'm wet.</p> <p>I can feel your heat when you move inside of me. Our bodies are moving against each other as I touch myself; I can't wait to be done with my lover. If this isn't too soon, there's always later.</p> <p>We move deeper into the woods. My wetness can't wait longer. No more thoughts about how to stop ourselves. We do the magic, the magic I promised I wouldn't tell anyone. As our bodies press closer to the ground, my heart starts to race. I'm on the brink; my body is on the edge. I'm going to explode. I reach between us and rub my pearl through my panties. The dampness is incredible as your fingers feel my silky skin.</p> <p>I slide the lace down slowly. My finger slips inside of my panties; I stroke it as you slide your cock deep inside my warmth. You fuck me for all I'm worth. Your hands move up and down my thighs. I could fuck for hours but there's time to finish this here. Right now, I'm ready and more that willing.</p> <p>As your hands continue their motions, the softness of your flesh begins to feel like a sweet velvet glove. I can feel your hands on my naked skin, sliding under the layers of layers of layers of clothing, moving as if you were sculpting a masterpiece. You're skin is so beautiful and so erotic I could have sat in a cathedral for days without my eyes getting sore. It's almost as if our bodies are made for each other... so beautiful is that. You remove your shirt, revealing your magnificent body. You look so sexy... you look so sexy... you look so sexy... you're so beautiful.</p> <p>Your hair, your lovely brown skin, it takes all of my control to keep from dropping my pants, and I do. Our bodies collide together, you take charge, fucking me hard and fast. My body begins to tremble...</p> <p>"Aaaahhh... fuck, I'm gonna cum!" I can feel the intensity of your movements. Your touch, all your fingers...</p> <p>"Oh you're wet! Ahhhh... you're so good... you're so good..." I can feel your orgasm getting closer... we move into the forest and into the woods...</p> <p>"Ahhhhh... I'm on the verge"</p> <p>My movements become even more intense, and your body moves faster. We move as one: on the edge. Faster and faster, your bodies slide together as I wrap my legs around you. Our sweat starts to drip, soaking, soaking our bodies.</p> <p>"Ahhhhh... you feel good baby."</p> <p>I'm close...so close...so close...</p> <p>"It's your turn now. We're gonna make each other cum..." I can't hold back anymore. My body begins to convulse as if I'm paralyzed...as your body, with great strength, takes over.</p> <p>"I'm so close. It'll never end!"</p> <p>I'm panting...so close...cumming...</p> <p>"Mmmm... oooh... yes...yes!"</p> <p>As I feel my body come down, you take it back, taking us both back to ecstasy...</p> <p>"Baby... I'm done."</p> <p>My skin, in your arms... You're holding me close, kissing my hair...</p> <p>"Mmmm... I'm gonna make you cum again tonight... you're so good to me!"</p> <p>"Ohhhh... ohh... so good..."</p> <p>We lay together in silence for a few minutes...</p> <p>"I love you."</p> <p>"I love you tooâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
