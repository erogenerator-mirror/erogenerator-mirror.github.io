It’s hard to describe the excitement that took over me as I pulled out a slim, black dildo from its plastic casing. I had no idea why; I couldn’t quite concentrate on the task at hand with the beautiful, sleek rubber monstrosity between my legs and the smell of leather on leather, but what was the point; I was going to fuck myself. I couldn’t stop thinking about the dildo. I didn’t know where to start, where to go, and who to fuck. My mind was blank.</p> <p>With my eyes firmly locked on the dildo, I took a deep breath to calm down and began to pump it into my wet pussy. I closed my eyes and let the muscles in my vagina slowly stretch out to accommodate the thick dildo. I lifted my legs up so they rested in a loose line. Slowly I began to move my pelvis in a circular motion, causing the dildo to press against the walls and press against the walls as well. I closed my eyes again and let the vibrations invade my pussy and fill me. I was lost in ecstasy.</p> <p>After a few minutes I put one foot back onto the bed, and pulled off the dildo, leaving the other knee up on the bed as if I were getting ready to stand in the sunlight. I turned a few sideways so the dildo could be pointed to its side. I was in a daze. I opened my eyes to watch the flickering of my eyelids. The candlelight cast a shadow against my bare thighs as I continued to wiggle the dildo, making sure that it was pointing at the ceiling. Slowly but surely, I looked up at the ceiling, wondering how far I could go with the dildo; so far was it going to go. I closed my eyes once more and continued with my own rhythm.</p> <p>I was almost ready to be fucked, with the dildo buried deep inside me. I wanted nothing more at that moment than feeling the shaft of the dildo inside me, deep within me. I felt it throb in my hand. I squeezed my fingers together a tiny bit. That’s it, that’s nice. Softer. Harder. I was ready for what? I still wasn’t sure; I couldn’t even remember anything about the man fucking me in the bedroom. But in that split second of my experience with David, it made me even wetter inside. Was he ever going to get a chance to fuck me on the bed?</p> <p>I didn’t know whether or not the pleasure of that moment would last me further. I kept pumping. I wasn’t going to finish the fucking. I thought I was going to go on. When David’s cock popped out of my pussy, I felt the dildo sliding up my thigh, as it neared my crotch, but after only a few seconds, I felt pressure building. My pussy began to clench the dildo around it. I had never ever felt that intense pressure at the end of a hard thrust or a long, strong thrust from a man so young. I was totally unprepared to realize how much this excited me, and when I started to feel some sort of pressure building in my pussy, the dildo felt even hotter in my hand inside me. When the dildo entered my mouth, I knew it couldn’t stop, and there was no going back. That pushed me even farther. I don’t know if there was a second or an hour, but in that split second, I found myself wondering in between my own juices: was David getting hard, and was he really thinking about fucking me in the morning?</p> <p>The more I thought about it, the more I felt pleasure start to build, and as soon as the stimulation ran through me and triggered the first wave of ecstasy that surged through my body, I began to cum. It didn’t feel like an orgasm, but was definitely an orgasm as the electricity shot through me. I was breathing hard, panting.</p> <p>Slowly, I pulled the dildo out of my mouth, and closed my eyes again. When I had recovered, I looked about at my surroundings in despair as I knew that I had no chance of walking straight, and when I looked back at my room, and the rest of my body felt as if it would collapse. I wanted to close my eyes, but I didn’t. I wanted to feel the dildo inside me - even if it weren’s base it was a single, but one single, and an unconnected, but one. Instead, I wanted some one of my breasts would feel an open to be squeezed between my legs squeezed to feel his cock and another—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
