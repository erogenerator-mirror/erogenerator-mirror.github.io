So wee read that God manifested</strong> and created us. In his words. So many stories with such characters were not even possible to understand yet. And the best part was reading his first day and being a believer in the Lord. It all makes perfect sense. Anyway, I felt the time was right to learn about this world. "I never knew I could be what you wanted, what you needed?"</p> <p>"I am not sure where this came from, but maybe it has to tell me before I could tell you. I think I'm falling in love with you", the voice of the young man he spoke to in his youth. He stood close to the side of the bed.</p> <p>I smiled. "How do you feel?"</p> <p>"I know that doesn't mean how I feel. I feel... happy."</p> <p>"Would it be strange if you just went on your trip to find me? To find some nice, beautiful, naked man with such a lovely cock that's hard to hide?"</p> <p>I smiled. "There isn't anything to hide now is there? That's something I need to find for myself today."</p> <p>I went over and sat beside him. It was quite easy to make him lie back. I wrapped my arms around him and gently kissed him. "There isn't anything for me to hide now is there?" I whispered.</p> <p>"I know, you're so beautiful, so smart... and caring," he whispered back to me.</p> <p>He was on his back, with his long hair tumbling down over his belly. My kisses had never felt so good to him before. Even I was so shy and still a virgin that this was the hardest and worst time of all for me. Even though he hadn't shown it yet, my mouth felt so much nicer than ever before. As he was lying on the bed in my arms, I was kissing his stomach and gently exploring his body while trying to learn more about him. His hands were touching me everywhere, just as he kissed me there. Finally, my mouth was at the end of his penis. I knew I'd do anything for him again. I kept kissing down his body toward his penis, his penis which had risen up even more as my tongue touched him. Finally I wrapped my lips around his shaft and he groaned, with such pleasure and love that even though I was so shy and scared, his dick was wonderful in just the right way. When I looked up he had a happy smile on him and his eyes were closed as he enjoyed the pleasure I was giving him. It didn't even bother him that I had no idea what was happening. He was enjoying the experience too much. I couldn't help but smile and look up at him and then take him into my mouth and suck him.</p> <p>He was in ecstasy and enjoying the feeling as long as he could and wouldn't want to stop until he gave in to the pleasure of feeling the love of it in his body from my sucking on his shaft. He moaned and sighed quietly and looked deeply into my eyes the whole while. I just nodded and continued to watch him. I was so happy that he looked so happy too. My heart melted as he slowly grew hard inside my mouth. He was still wearing his dress, and when I slowly sucked on his penis, it became apparent to me that he was fully erect after he had started to enjoy himself in some small way. I was on my knees between his legs and started to suck his shaft again. I was learning my way around what my body was feeling like and it felt wonderful. He was just as hard as I though he'd be in any of his years of life. I looked up and grinned at him as I sucked him.</p> <p>After the first few minutes of sucking his penis, something else happened when I took his cock out of my mouth. He didn't react. I just felt sorry that he wasn't responding. I had a sudden change of heart. The time is about to come when he will come.</p> <p>I felt his body being shaken with the shock that I was sucking his penis and then my mouth was being filled with his cum again which caused me to look up at him with such happiness as his entire body tensed up. He looked so joyful that I felt ashamed and embarrassed.</p> <p>As soon as his body stopped tensing, I was on my knees again and started kissing his chest. It was soft and smooth and soon I was kissing a very sensitive spot. I just kept licking his chest and he closed his eyes. Our kisses were the closest thing to normal I've ever seen in a man.</p> <p>Finally, he felt so good that he opened his eyes as he reached out his hand again, I kissed he grabbed into his hand and gently pulled out he was out he found himself. I put my mouth and he went like a real. We were again. this time has made of the most different with everything has been for me that he and time now.
