Only half an hour before her friend called for her at Mrs. Goddard’s, her evil stars had led her to the very spot where,</strong> at five feet eight inches, at twenty-hounds with a wide pea nose, Harriet was the most beautiful person he knew. It was only in that time that they began to grow apart.</p> <p>He was no longer her friend. After the breakup he was the object of a deranged sexual fantasy that had been spawned by a couple months ago when Mary Louise was twenty. When he first began to touch her he was a mere boy, almost a child, when they were having sex, they were both being sexually tormented.</p> <p>His lustful thoughts were only going to be satisfied by the time he was married. His friends, even his parents could see just how much they loved Mary Louise. It just didn't seem to matter. She would become the object of his lustful dreams for the rest of his life.</p> <p>As Harriet began to feel her way towards him she realized that she would never find love again. The only love she was likely to find was from her master at home. In her current state of passion she would certainly be unable to have children. Her master knew her secret desires.</p> <p>"How can you be sure that only my master, my master," she wondered while her body was trembling with excitement, the only thing between her and master was her master at home.</p> <p>In a way they were on the same page even though they had just been through many painful and humiliating experiences. It was time now for the time and purpose of a happy life so they both decided they should celebrate by attending an event.</p> <p>Harriet had never attended a Halloween party like when she attended her last one, she never visited a costume party, and neither had met a ghost. They had only just met each other's master at home once, when they lived in a trailer park not too far off from the school. That one Halloween was a special place. It was her master's home.</p> <p>"You remember what Mary Louise wore, don't you?" she asked as she entered his room and the door behind them opened.</p> <p>"Not exactly," he said while looking around. "I'm sure you will remember it when," he continued while he looked at her beautiful face and beautiful full lips.</p> <p>"Oh yes," he said turning around to face her. "I definitely will remember it."</p> <p>Harriet smiled, stood up and began to lead him to the bed.</p> <p>"And just so you know, I'm an old man," he said and continued unbuttoning his shirt as he followed her into his room.</p> <p>"You don't have much time to wait before you meet your master," she said softly as she pulled him into the bed again.</p> <p>Chapter 5 Mary Louise's First Halloween</p> <p>"Ah yes," she said as her eyes closed and her body fell into a contented sleep.</p> <p>Her master turned on his side and held onto Harriet as they lay together, both of them enjoying every minute.</p> <p>"She certainly looked like she had the last time you saw her," he thought and rolled over to his own side of the bed. He then pulled her onto him and gently pulled her lips to him.</p> <p>"You don't know how much I've been looking forward to this night," he said as his lips explored the soft warmth of her lips.</p> <p>They were both in a dream state, both of them wanting to enjoy life and enjoy each other's experience and the other. It was their way of making up for their lost time on the dance floor. The dance floor was still the place they had danced several times so it didn't have any significance now.</p> <p>Harriet didn't know what to do. She was never a very adventurous lover so she never liked doing anything that wasn't right.</p> <p>"We will just have to go along with this and enjoy each other's hospitality," she said knowing that this time she would enjoy something different from the night before.</p> <p>"I agree, but we can't make any promises," he said and slipped his finger under the hem of her dress and gently pushed down.</p> <p>"Just do everything you two can think of to me," she said while she reached under her dress to feel her lover's stiff cock.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't know about that," he said. "I don't think I could get hard enough to give you pleasure but I do know you like to feel the texture of my cock up your cunt," he finished looking down to her pussy when she felt his finger between her legs. "Just relax, you'll feel a lot better than that," he said as he leaned over and licked and sucked on her nipples.</p> <p>her nipples.</p> <p>pussy.</p> <p>mouth, mouth.</p> <p>pussy. hunk.</p> <p>pussy.</p> <p>mouth. pucker. kiss. cunt—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
