His cock - still inside her - made his movements slow and deliberate. It looked as though his cock might start to move - like it might change colour - when he came.</p> <p>Harry's cock never seemed out of place inside a woman. Emma's thighs, which were pressed against his groin, weren't quite closed. It still felt good; as good as it did when she could feel his pulse within. It was a good thing Harry kept moving.</p> <p>Still lying on her back, Harry's cock was moving in and out, in and out, making it harder and thicker and wetter and slippery with every movement. It was a lovely warm feeling, filling her.</p> <p>There is not much left to the imagination when fucking. But Emma wasn't thinking of what was going on inside there. The big, beautiful man lying on her body felt like the most wonderful, wonderful man-made, man-flesh she'd ever felt.</p> <p>Harry's cock just felt right inside her pussy. Emma hadn't liked it as much as Harry did. And she wasn't sure about how good it would feel lying there, naked and wet and naked without even having any idea what life might be like with someone else, naked and naked in the middle of the night, naked and wet and naked, with a man in bed beside them.</p> <p>And as wonderful as being naked against someone's nakedness felt, there was the problem of whether someone's nakedness felt good to her even if someone else had been naked, naked and naked between her thighs. It was difficult not to feel happy. She could feel everything Harry's body did around them.</p> <p>It was a miracle that Harry's cock remained hard. It was a miracle that he couldn't make love to Emma, but that it was possible. It was also a miracle that Harry didn't try to fuck her as often as necessary. That both Harry and his cock remained solid and erect as far as she could tell, which meant that Harry would have to move his body over hers every shift. The last thing Emma wanted was to end up in a bed with the sheets on her naked breasts, with Harry's cock up inside her, instead of the two of them being naked and having sex.</p> <p>Now it would be easier to move around the bed with Harry's cock still against her naked, wet and naked pussy, and his cock against her hot, wet and naked chest. Better to stay in bed with Harry's cock against Emma's naked body.</p> <p>But now it would be an even better idea to stay in bed with Emma instead, with Harry's cock still wet and hard inside her. Better to stay in bed with Harry's cock in Emma's pussy, with Harry's hard cock inside Emma's willing and wet wet pussy, with Harry's hard cock inside Emma's wanton little body, with Harry's hard cock still between Emma's thighs and his hard cock inside Emma's willing and wet pussy. Better to stay in bed with Harry's cock and his hard cock. Better not have anyone waiting to get into bed with Harry or have a chance to kiss Emma, to hold hands in the dark and be kissed by Emma, who wanted everything Harry got from her. Better to be naked and under the moon, with Harry's cock deep inside Emma's pussy, with Harry's hard cock filling Emma's pussy, and with Harry making soft, loving love to Emma. Better not tell Emma about it afterwards if Emma was worried about what it would be like. Better to be naked and under the moon, with Emma's body warm and naked against him, while everyone is talking and looking at you and pretending you're Emma, and not someone else. Better not to tell Emma about it afterwards. Better to make sure there's nobody else around when everyone has their fun. Better to be sleeping with Emma when she wakes up to find herself in bed with Harry.</p> <p>If it was ever decided to stay naked with Emma before, if it was a permanent solution to her situation, now she wouldn't feel like anyone could ever know.</p> <p>So she'd stay naked! She would fuck!</p> <p></p> <p>Emma never wanted her</p> <p>If anybody else loved her</p> <p>And never</p> <p>Never wanted her If it</p> <p>Always liked to Always had Emma Had her A name</p> <p>Never to know Emma be</p> <p>Always Never been one.
