He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted</strong> his head to look at the ceiling, he saw a woman with dreadlocks sitting on the bed next to a book. She wore a tiny pair of panties on her slender legs, and they were the only white cotton he could find.</p> <p>"I am going to make the most of the night..." she said. Her slender green-golden neck had been broken free of the layers of clothing, and a small diamond-head ring pierced through her left nipple. She had a white collar and a simple metal stud, with an emerald in the middle, with little circles and diamonds on the right, as well as an elaborate golden stud on her right teacup. Gregor's dick was hard, pointing upwards at around seven inches, and he thought it had to be about ten inches around. And she was looking good. He tried not to let it show for long, though, and went back to sleep.</p> <p>Samsa woke several times later, and found that it was hard to breathe. Every time she tried to close her eyes, they snapped up with a start. Her head hung backwards, and the bed was still dark. "Mia?" she said. The bed was rocking slightly, and she looked up at her alarm clock, which was standing at ninety percent.</p> <p>"Mia?" she repeated. "I'm on duty..." She took another breath before standing up. "Are you sleeping?"</p> <p>"Yes," she said, turning her back towards the bed and climbing onto it. She sat on the edge of the mattress, resting her forehead against the coolness of the sheet. Gregor watched her, and then sat himself down on top of the pile of pillows, his penis standing like a statue, a mere five inches away from her open sex, and inches from her perfect breasts. Samsa looked at them for a moment, then reached between her legs and grasped his erection, pulling herself into a more comfortable position with her knees under her breasts.</p> <p>Gregor felt a sudden stab of jealousy. "I love your fucking tits," he whispered. "I want you back so badly..." she said, and looked at him with a smile.</p> <p>"I'm not that old-" he trailed off, unable to say that. Her breasts were about the size of his hands and she was still lying on her back, with her legs spread and her hand around his dick. "...I have to say..." she started again, and Gregor nodded.</p> <p>"I love your face." She stared again at the wall, her mouth suddenly moving slightly apart. "I love your eyes." She touched Gregor's eye with a finger, and he closed his eyes, which were wide, and he squeezed them tightly. Samsa's eyes widened, the pupils dilated, her mouth forming into an 'O'. Her long hair fanned out around her, and her face turned red.</p> <p>"I-I feel... sorry for hurting you..." he said.</p> <p>"For what?" she said, moving her legs apart and staring at him.</p> <p>"I feel sorry for hurting you." He leaned forward and kissed her on the mouth, and she started to kiss him more aggressively, their tongues running and exploring. His cock was hard against her, and she gasped a little when his dick grazed her, but she didn't stop.</p> <p>"But... it feels good..." she said.</p> <p>"But I'm not in trouble." He felt a pang of sadness that she had decided to leave him, he thought.</p> <p>"I can't be in trouble if you are." Samsa said, and looked down at the shaft of his erection, and then back up his face. "I can't..." she said, before letting her eyes fall, then, her face, down at his dick, and then her eyes. Her beautiful face was beautiful in his eyes. "Can't I?" She asked him, and he nodded.</p> <p>"I can't say," he said. "I will be happy."</p> <p>"Mia?" she asked, and he nodded again.</p> <p>"I want to... you know... have a taste..." she whispered. Gregor stared at her eyes, his eyes dark, even more so than the rest of his body, but he couldn't deny his desires.</p> <p>"You..." he said, but only barely above a whisper.</p> <p>"Mia!?" she repeated. Gregor looked down at her, his face contorted in a smile. He kissed her on the top of her head, and his fingers played on her breasts again. And her nipples. And her clitoris, he thought.</p> <p>And he did.</p> <p>And he had his friend.</p> <p></p> <p>And he could't-in-my-for-and-him-him-him-me-him-himâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
