His dick and hands moved with me, sliding up and down my back, then cupped my cheeks, pulling me to him. For the first time, without any of the restrictions of the medical intervention, the other person reciprocated, their lips sliding over mine, tongues flicking together.</p> <p>It was at this point that I recalled to myself that all of my ex and ex-girlfriends, none of them to my own, were pretty much the next of my age. And they weren't me either, nor was that one of the reasons I had to see another face every time I came in contact with his naked ass, or the other side of his cock.</p> <p>I remember that at this exact time, I opened my eyes and found him looking me up and down with a smile. I was wearing a pair of tight red spandex cargo pants, the front button undone, the slits on the sides of the pants showing, a very tight V-neck, showing a lot of cleavage on his chest.</p> <p>As both of them undressed me, I closed my eyes and kissed Mark, pressing our bodies against each other, feeling him sliding his hands down over my belly to my bottom, then feeling my flesh with his fingertips as he cupped the cheeks, pushing them together. He broke the kiss and I opened my eyes, meeting his gaze and smiling at how lucky I looked as he began kissing me down my chest to my stomach and back up. I was already dripping down to meet their moistening bodies, his fingers and thumbs tracing the contours of my skin, the tops of my breasts, the base of my neck, the valley between my breasts, my ribs, the top of my breasts, and my nipples.</p> <p>It was only when he moved his head and placed a kiss on my right breast that I couldn't control my response. I arched my back to push the nipple into his mouth, and moan in bliss as his tongue flicked over it, my head back, as I began to writhe in the same way while he slowly and expertly sucked and nibbled on my other breast. His fingers slid up the outside of my body, pushing their way into the crease of my cleavage, the tops of my breasts, and sliding down further, up the center of my chest to my throat and the tops of my tits.</p> <p>His mouth was still on me, making me writhe a bit while he sucked on me, and his fingers now slid up my stomach, over my navel to the top of my pants and the very edge of my panties. His fingers were pressing into the flesh of my lower stomach and I could feel him stroking down the curve of it. He had me so wound up that with a single movement, he moved back up the front of my body and had me straddle the side of an outstretched finger to press against my pussy lips. His eyes were closed as he pushed his middle finger in as far as he could get it, and he was sliding the finger in and out, his tongue going in and out of my ear.</p> <p>Without words, he removed my pants, slipping them off, and then my underwear, which I removed along with them and folded them. I was now naked except, with panties still on, with my arms around him, feeling the touch of his naked body pressed against mine, the kiss that I wanted to be more than friends.</p> <p>His mouth felt so good, it was just like the hands he had on me earlier. Slowly, he began to kiss further up my body towards my breast. His right hand moved along my side, and from my side, he pushed my legs further apart until his middle finger was touching my clit. I didn't have to think long, not really, before I was writhing uncontrollably under his arm and feeling his finger begin to slip inside me. I was already on the edge, already going to orgasm as he continued to kiss me on my lips and ears, across my collarbone, and finally moving his lips away from my nipples.</p> <p>My head fell back to go from side to side, my hair a tangle around my face. I wanted to look into his eyes, feel them on my body as we pleasured each other at the same time, but instead I looked into his face, seeing the same burning desire in the depths of his eyes, in his expression, as it played out when he kissed me. I had him by the cock now and I wanted to touch and squeeze it, I wanted to see it, feel it inside me.</p> <p>I moved the fingers up to his shoulder, pushing my hands around it and his neck, feeling the soft skin there and he pulled my nipple into my breast, pressing down, and as if I saw the hair, as my body and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
