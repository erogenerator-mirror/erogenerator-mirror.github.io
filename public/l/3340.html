The Problem</h4><p><strong>I confess at these words a shudder passed through me. There was a thrill in the doctor’s voice which showed that he was himself deeply moved by that which he</strong> had done so many years ago but had been suppressed.</p> <p>I wondered how long it would take him to become my boyfriend then it would be like with that which had been there.

My fingers flew to my clit as I started to stroke it. My eyes closed as I pictured having sex with him. Then I pictured feeling his cock in me with him. My fingers became damp as they were getting so wet.</p> <p>I went to work the next day feeling excited about where I would go from there. I was very horny, but also scared as I was about what I would be doing with my boyfriend.</p> <p>I thought of him as I put down the phone on my desk and leaned over it. My breasts were just about touching my hand. I imagined him there between them with that beautiful cock waiting for me.</p> <p>I finished my work and picked up the phone. The phone dinged on my desk.
