"Well, how do you feel? Are your nerves achy?"</p> <p>"They are."</p> <p>"I'm sorry?" I said. "What happened to you? Did there not be a more important thing than your own self? That's it."</p> <p>"Not even a small one. And it was the best that you've got. I only came to your wedding, to the world at last."</p> <p>You are the only thing that's had I ever had that is not to be made a liar, a liar, someone's worst enemy."</p> <p>I tried to remember him. He was everything. The first time we spoke, was a few years ago. All we did was kiss. When I tried to say something to him, he was away. We didn't see each other for several more days. I was getting desperate at this point.</p> <p>So I put my hand on his knee. And then I let go. And I held his hand to my breast as he lay face down on the altar. My fingers and thumbs pressed against his ass, and felt him pull back.</p> <p>"What are you doing!"</p> <p>"The first thing that Redeemeth will do, as he is made to be will not be to let it go," I said. The thought of him fucking me had aroused me.</p> <p>To be honest, I wanted him. That is why now.</p> <p>I could see myself on my knees on the altar. The sight would be so beautiful, so powerful, if only I had this to look at. It wasn't like it had been when he had me chained; it wasn't like it had been when I was having the baby.</p> <p>I'd never had two men at once. That thought sent a jolt through me. I'd never seen two men kissing. Now I see, in the light of every day, in the night. I was kissing a man, and when I did, his mouth tasted a different kind of sweetness. It's strange, I don't know, but he wasn't trying to suck my lips or tongue and I guess the way that we did it together was just good. My fingers stroked his ass, and then found it again.</p> <p>The two men were getting a very good view, now that I thought about it, of me lying nude on the ground for them. I saw both of them come over to me, kneel down, and suckle my nipples. I had such a strange feeling of pleasure that, while I may not have known what it was, I could never imagine not sucking it.</p> <p>After the kissing and sucking, they had me lie down. The two men kissed my legs, then, while the other one went down, the one that kissed me was lower. I could feel his fingers against my asshole, touching me back there. I wanted it, I wanted him.</p> <p>A little at first. Then there were more to come. I looked down at them kissing me, I looked into their eyes. I felt a little silly, and ashamed. I was not ashamed of what I was doing, but of the fact that I wanted to do it to make a difference, to save a young life! I wanted it to change him. I could no longer have a hope for the future.</p> <p>"Do you want to do this?" I asked.</p> <p>"No!"</p> <p>He looked at me as if he was asking if I was sure.</p> <p>"I want your baby," I said.</p> <p>"I want to carry your baby."</p> <p>I thought about that.</p> <p>"I want, so."</p> <p>"I want you to..." I said.</p> <p>"And I want to carry your child." That sounded pretty much like something that he wanted to tell me.</p> <p>I saw him smile.</p> <p>"There, that wasn't so bad, was it?"</p> <p>He seemed to be smiling at me. I wondered.</p> <p>"No. It was good. Not bad. It was so good."</p> <p>"I wish there was another way."</p> <p>"How?" I wanted to.</p> <p>"There."</p> <p>"There?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Oh, yes! Yes! There! Now the moment when you feel his sperm splash against you. Are you pregnant?"</p> <p>He was lying there on the altar.</p> <p>"You're right. Yes. I am."</p> <p>"We're going to have an abortion then."</p> <p>And then they were kissing again.</p> <p>After a bit of that, a moment in time later, I saw him lying on the next to me. We looked and there, his face over me. He looked at me. No- it was different. "It wasn't just felt good! And he was goodâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
