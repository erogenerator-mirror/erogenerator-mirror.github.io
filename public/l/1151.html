Either from</strong> having consumed more than three martinis, or from a double vodka and tonic, it was still early hours in the morning.</p> <p>She was sitting there in her hotel room, in a hotel room at the North Pole. Her hair was in its customary bun from the shower, and she wore only her pink panties, which she had purposely left on while showering. They came down to reveal not even a small part of her pussy, nor did they hide a third part of her ass. Her panties barely contained her pussy, and her panties were crotchless, as were her bra and panties.</p> <p>But what was even more of a surprise was that she was having the time of her life. The last day of the summer was her last day of college for the year. She was having the time of her life, as was she. The weekend was a special day for her, as was today. But, at the end of the day, her first true sexual experience happened.</p> <p>Before, she had just gone to college. Today, she was just going to graduate her junior year in an almost perfect state, and that was her last year of college.</p> <p>Before leaving for college, she had just celebrated her freedom, and she had not even been to the airport because she was so excited about graduating college and becoming an adult again. But she was young, so excited, and so totally fucked up. Today was her final year of high school. She was nineteen years old and already pregnant. She had already done sex with so many men, but she had never gone back for sex. Only three men had ever been inside her. And only each one had taken her virginity, as she had done, in her ass, her cunt, or her ass, and only one had ever been able to make love to her, ever with her mouth, her ass, or her clit, and only each one had been able to push his cock, maybe all the way in her, up into her vagina.</p> <p>Her best friend had been the only man who had ever fucked her since she had left for college. She knew it meant nothing and only meant she must be a virgin. She was almost as much a whore as he was, and she was even more of a slut. She was a whore for one man, and by the end of a night of lovemaking and sucking, she was so horny she could not go to sleep.</p> <p>She did not even want to have a man, the man whom she loved, one man or the other. She just wanted to fall in love with one man, and not the one she loved most. As a woman, sex was fun and exciting, but not the fun and exciting pleasure that a man gave her. It was almost like a life without sex.</p> <p>However, she knew this would be a life to remember. She was not just happy. It was a life.</p> <p>Today, she was going to graduate college. She had completed her junior year of college, and she was excited by the first night of sex for her. Today, she got two years of college experience, with lots of orgasms, and she had fucked a total stranger. What they were doing was just between two guys, and nowhere near the way she imagined they would do, at the hotel or at an apartment.</p> <p>She did not have a husband. She had been married twice. She had just gotten her degree on a business management degree. She knew that she had to think of a life for herself after the end of her two years there. In two years, she would graduate with her degree. She would graduate without a doubt. She knew that she knew it. She felt the moment of truth that she did not feel today. She was a whore, a dirty whore. She deserved to be one. She deserved to get her degree, and the best man, the man who had been good to her. She deserved to get her master, the man who had brought her pleasure, who made her feel young again, and who would love her and love her forever, and love her, if she gave him. For the last two years, she had been in love with him, and he was an older man.</p> <p>She knew all of this. She knew where everything stood. She knew the place of honor on two legs. She knew where the best man of her life was in front of the best man of her life. With great excitement and hope she could give him happiness. She wondered if he was the man who had the best man she had ever known, in the world.</p> <p>She was sure he was already on the first plane to the airport, a man who had been her master of her life.</p> <p></p> <p>to her.</p> <p>to her, the best man, and</p> <p></p> <p>to her future lover</p> <p>to who.</p> <p>to her future one,</p> <p>to—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
