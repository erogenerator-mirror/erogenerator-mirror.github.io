My first-ever female female.</p> <p>I was fucking that first woman after having sucked the first girl into me, the first of many.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>At first, you weren't quite there. Your first sexual experience was limited to your average missionary position, which is usually the main reason the men look at it that way. I didn't know, but the first of those girls who were my first sexual experiences were my first female lovers as well, and they were all worth, and all worth well, to me. And if the fact that most of them were female, then they were probably all the best to be in, or at, their first.</p> <p>The reason you were such a good fucker was that it meant that that you were giving everything you'd put your own mind into to that second sexual experience that you didn't get to experience the first time you sucked that first girl into your world, a female who came to you after you'd been there, and you'd taken her into your own world, where you knew you loved her that way. The reason you did what you did, that way would be the reason that I was doing what I did at the time.</p> <p>After the first time you'd brought yourself to orgasm, I was able to fuck the second girl, and the first female. At first it was slow, but you did it well. Then, and for months afterward, it was more and more pleasurable; I couldn't believe how much of an effect the fact that I was doing was having on each girl. They knew when I was in, in, behind, and in front of them. My first two girls, one a virgin, and the other an experienced lover. I'm sure I made them both cum at least twice, one at a time, for the sake of fucking them both at the same time that it had for me at that point, but then it had to be fast for them. There was no way it could be fast enough for me to continue to use that method, which for me was usually slow, because I was so aroused.</p> <p>It wasn't that I was sexually unsatisfied. I wasn't sexually aroused at all. The thing is, if this was the first time, then it was the most sexually satisfying encounter with each of them that I'd ever had.</p> <p>So, while one of the other girls was getting fucked and getting fucked now in a sexual world that she never would have been comfortable with, a third girl was getting to the center, and had been to her first orgasm.</p> <p>This one, that one thing that I'd done so well, did as well as did the first two girls. I was doing so well that I could have stayed there for days. What's the difference between being done when you know you're doing it, and having to stay there forever? Besides, we're all girls. Of course, that's what we're all going to go through tomorrow, and you're not going to be doing it.</p> <p>So I was a good fucker in the first place, and it hadn't hurt that I had one of these sexual girls to please when I was doing just what I was doing. In that time, though, as I felt the first orgasm of the day come, I didn't feel a thing. The second orgasm, I felt that my balls were tingling, that the end of my erection had disappeared and was not only going to fade as I was fucking the second and third girls, but the way I was doing it.</p> <p>What I felt, and what I felt as my whole body shuddered under the force of the two orgasms that I was having, I didn't even know. I'm not sure. I didn't know the answer to anything, and what I didn't know was the feeling of euphoria and sexual release.</p> <p>A little while later, the third girl had finally left. The first one had almost always left, and so it had been that I stayed as well, and the second one had left also. But this two girl was the most likely to have left, and that second one left. As far as I knew, she was at least twenty years older than what she was then, but when you're fucking a girl in her 20s, even if she's your first time in her life, at least that time would still be young enough. After I'd fucked the first girl, the second one left too, and only left once, which just made me fuck her even harder and more, to see if I could just get my balls to settle.</p> <p>sober, and me, and all. in.</p> <p>a.
