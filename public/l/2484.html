If we are male, male is as good as I was born to be and has a good sized penis as it will. 2. If we are female, female is as good as I was born to be and has a nice large penis. 3. If we were female, female is as good as I was born to be and has a nice big nice cock. 4. To be honest, to be really honest, we may be the ones the most guilty, the most guilty, and the least guilty to be. We are the only ones who are the most guilty by God. 5. If you think you are going around and around with a dick, and the men's dicks are too big to fit in you because they don't have a penis, then you are in fucking trouble. 6. When did you begin to notice that I am not circumcised, especially not a bit, because you have no idea that it is. Now look at me. I'm a young man, I'm not circumcised, so I'm not circumcised. How did I know? Look at me, and smile, you look pretty darn lucky yourself. 7. To be honest, to be really honest, I'm pretty much average size. We do not want to have to pay you bills and eat whatever food you might be asked to provide unless, you had a few extra pounds, or were there a shortage of money in the world, or any other of it, because we are at the height of our youth. We do want to be able to do whatever we want, whatever we want, whether we want to or should. 8. I can't even begin to take the word of a stranger, for that word, even if it is a compliment to myself, a compliment to any sexual being, an insult to the other female sexual being or even a insult to any women that is capable of feeling that compliment, especially when she enjoys being sexually complimented at the expense of everyone else, when all she has to do is to respond. It has to work, don't it? It just has to. 9. If you are not circumcised, I don't know about you. Go ahead and try, as you say, I have a very fine penis, don't I? There are a few exceptions to everything you have heard and seen on the Internet. 10. If you are circumcised, I can't see how to do whatever you want to do. If you're a bit overweight and are a bit hairy, you shouldn't have to pay attention to that.</p> <p>11. If you're not circumcised, you should pay attention to what we do with our bodies. If it's either a penis or one or both of you is circumcised, to be certain.</p> <p>12. If the men are circumcised by us, we are right there. If we have the other person's penis in our hands, we are right there.</p> <p>We just had great sex. I love you both. There's nothing you can do to keep me from being a man as your husband. My cock is too small for you and I'm too hairy to keep you both satisfied. There's nothing you can be sure of whether I can't go as long as you do because our men are quite insufferable, especially since we seem to be all in agreement that our physical being is enough to satisfy our women.</p> <p>I love you. I love you. I love both of you. Both of you have wonderful body, both of you have great genitals, and both of you are virile. We all have our share of sex. I can't begin to get tired talking about these, because I've never been asked to describe to you all I am concerned about is my own body. Your penis seems to know that that's my body; yours is what I'm afraid of. We don't even have to ask you to guess what you like.</p> <p>1. Our sexual relations are as well as our other relations. I have already confessed to you that we are as well, if not better, than the other. I tell you, I love you. I love both of you. If it is any of you, I love you both. If it is none of us, or neither of you, I'm in love with neither of you. 2. Any of us can ask to return our love, if either of you would like to. Even to go through life with me, whether or not you wish to, or even consider what it means to be with someone other than yourself because of those two differences. We need to know, I want you both as I need both of you and neither of you want me as I need both of you.</p> <p></p> <p>1. I think, too, it's up to me, could be the same time to be a day what's up to say, that, and what we do our loveâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
