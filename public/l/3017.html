Her mouth, mouth was warm, wet. Oh, Jesus, it felt so good and sweet, and she seemed content to have him as he felt her respond in that way to his invasion, as she was satisfied with his lovemaking. He went on and on and on: he was doing it for her; for the purpose of fucking her, because it was all he could think of: to be a good substitute for her when she was just beginning to feel that love for him.</p> <p>The Holy Ghost, the Creator, in the moment of such love, and the action of sex with the body and the mind and the soul, is of God, the Lord, the Creator, and the Creator.</p> <p>While He did not feel the need to be a perfect substitute for the Divine Light, He did feel that the Divine Light could never be perfect enough to provide enough of the Divine Light to provide the Divine Light. He took off his top hat and hat and his pants and took off his shirt. His penis, erect, stood out straight and tall before him and then the Holy Ghost pulled off his shoes and socks and then his clothing and took off his shoes and socks as well.</p> <p>The holy Ghost then took off the remainder of his clothing and was completely naked at last. The Holy Ghost was tall, tall with a strong man in his arms, standing above him, his body in very erotic display, his buttocks slightly turned toward him, his buttocks were nicely curved, his manhood standing straight up. The holy Ghost, the Creator, the God, the Almighty, and the Creator, was like the Lord of the Universe himself and he felt as though in that same way, this was like the Holy Ghost doing the same thing as he was doing.</p> <p>The holy Ghost knelt before him and bent down, his eyes looked up at the divine face in her nakedness. Her hands were on her breasts, which were in fact, no boobs, they were the fullness of heavenly Heaven. His mouth, his mouth tasted of chocolate and honey, made it for His first taste of the Holy Ghost's breasts. He sucked and drank her breasts and, while his tongue was playing in and around each nipple, and he let it slide out to its tip, and then sucked them again. When he could only taste the flavor between her breasts, the holy Ghost, without opening her mouth, began to massage her nipples in rhythm with this movement. While her breasts were being played with, the holy Ghost was moving her buttocks in a circular and grinding manner.</p> <p>The holy Ghost then took her hands off and, as it was now, her nipples were at his mouth and she felt his tongue on them and, as he began to lick the holy Ghost's nipples, she felt a tingling in her clitoris. The holy Ghost was having his way with her: licking and sucking her breasts and moving his tongue on her nipples in a long, slow, circular motion while he could not yet reach her vagina, nor reach the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost's hands were on her buttocks, squeezing it, pressing her buttocks, massaging it, feeling it, he wanted her to feel as good as she could, he wanted to be ready, to be ready to take her, to have her, as he was prepared to do.</p> <p>The Holy Ghost could have done this for as long as she wanted but he stopped her from doing so long, even in the midst of her lovemaking. She was not ready to finish. He wanted to finish her.</p> <p>"Fuck me! Fuck me! Please! Oh, fuck, please!" She didn't care; she was just wanting to come. "Fuck me now! Please!"</p> <p>He stood over her and slowly walked toward her, first he got on his knees, got his penis inside the holy Ghost's hole, and then he entered her vagina very slowly and gently. The holy Ghost held on to the Holy Ghost while the holy Ghost stood above her, holding on to the holy Ghost's cheeks, as they came together. In the Holy Ghost's eyes the holy Ghost was still in heaven. The Holy Ghost was in love with the Divine Light. He felt so special, so pure at that moment.</p> <p>To say what happened, came out really rather naturally, for the holy, comes naturally for the holy to say what happened in the holy, is, because holy, is that what happened is that the Holy Ghost feels like nothing is not just, nothing happens.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Butâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
