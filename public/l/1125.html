This threw her in</strong> a sexual situation where no boy should get to feel her naked body. And even if they had, they were far from it.</p> <p>Cosette looked herself in the mirror. Her pale skin was flawless, her hair looked perfect, and her eyes were a blue, deep blue that she could easily see into the room where her body rested. No one looked more gorgeous to her eyes, in her experience. And most of all, most of the boys in school still looked at her. Cosette felt the desire to do so. And the yearning to be touched down there. And she couldn't wait for the day when the boys would see her naked body.</p> <p>Cosette looked at herself again in the mirror. She felt good. Cosette had just been fucked by a boy just about 20 minutes ago, and he had just walked out of her body, leaving a trail of cum on her bed. She smiled at herself. It felt good. She would definitely be doing that again someday.</p> <p>Cosette was nervous about going on a date with another boy, but she couldn't seem to get a hold of anyone in her life. Then her first date was with her senior boyfriend. She thought he'd be a total asshole. For her, his sexual experience, which is almost his only sexual experience, was lacking. He seemed too young. So maybe he was just too immature. He seemed so young and pretty. That's why she started dating him. But his cock was something else. He was so small, so cute, and he made her feel that she was pretty and desirable. She didn't know what to make of it. For him, she felt good and alive. But for him, she just felt empty and lonely.</p> <p>Cosette got up when she realised her date was late. Even though he was a nice enough guy, he still treated her well. She wasn't the prettiest girl in the school, but she was a knockout. Her blonde hair shone in the sun, her blue eyes sparkled in the breeze, and her figure looked amazing in a bikini. This day she didn't dress up, only in panties and bra. And her boyfriend looked like a total perv trying to sneak a peak at her body because he was hoping to impress her in the worst way. What a stupid little pervert!</p> <p>Cosette's boyfriend tried his best to avoid her for as long as he could but he couldn't resist her when she was so pretty. After all, she was very hot, and her boyfriend seemed to love her.</p> <p>Cosette had always had an attraction to her physical body. She liked to play it off that there were so many attractive boys in her school. But even she knew there was more chemistry between her than there was in looking at her from afar. Cosette had always been faithful to her boyfriend, and she didn't do too bad of an impression of herself after meeting him. And even though she felt like she was alone, Cosette wasn't sure how to approach another girl with that knowledge.</p> <p>Cosette finished getting ready for her first date. And she got dressed. She put on a low-cut night shirt and a pair of panties but no bra, and she also put on a pair of loose, loose panties that exposed her long, luscious legs and flat stomach. When she pulled on her panties, she felt her panties moist and sticky. She wanted to be clean to start with, but that just proved that she liked the idea of being clean to start out with. She put on the night shirt, and then her panties and nightie and everything else and put them in her purse before she went out and came back to the room.</p> <p>Cosette sat on the bed to write her text message, which she had to do at the last moment. At least she could get her hand in the right place and she didn't have to go to college in a half hour. That way, she wouldn't have to take a bus the next day.</p> <p>What was the best sex experience, Cosette thought. She wanted to hear that it was okay. That she was safe, she had made a lot of friends and she had got lucky with a guy she had a crush on. She thought it might help things if she could somehow persuade her boyfriend that it was okay. For a girl that had just left the school of a boy who had a crush on her.</p> <p>Cosette texted her boyfriend as usual every day. Sometimes her text message just came up on her inbox so that he got to see her naked body. Usually, she used to write a message in reply to texts from boyfriends.</p> <p>The first text from him on her day went something like: "What a real girl with a crush on her? A crush? I don't you in a girl on a girl on her? Don'</p> <p></p> <p>Cosette replied:Cosette's friend Cosette's friend Cos—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
