But the man really would not be kissing her nipples: he would surely be fucking her, sucking on them, while he held his arms up in front of both her tits to lift her upper body off the table. She had to resist an urge to look, to take a step forwards, from where she was sat, up towards the window of the conservatory. But she could not look away now: her heart thumped its own rhythm, her nipples stiff under his fingertips.</p> <p>Ellen had always been a breast and pussy lover, but this first day at the station was like something out of a movie. Mr Elliot's warm hands on her breasts had not felt quite so different, more natural. He was still, she found herself, even as his touch sent an immediate rush through her veins. Maybe it was because the experience had lasted a long time and yet felt so, so natural, as his hands caressed, his lips and tongue made all the time, as they explored every inch of her, every pore with his tongue, as his hands and fingers explored her body.</p> <p>But not today. Mr Elliot kissed her neck and ear lobe. He nibbled on her ear lobes. Then he kissed her again, with the promise of her body, her tits, her thighs, her legs: she held his head, pressed his face, the way it seemed to be pushing, pressing its way up her throat into her body. The taste, the smell, the texture, his hands, the feel of her. And then he took her again, with that same promise, with those same promises, his mouth: not once did he give any sign of his lust for her. It didn't take much effort for them to kiss each other, and it was all the more exciting, it was so naughty, so powerful.</p> <p>Her breasts ached. She would have lost control of their pleasure: she would have been unable to prevent herself from screaming. She would have, if Mr Elliot had continued: if he had done exactly what he was doing to her right now, before this train had left this station, before the journey, and while she had wanted him to kiss them so many times. He would have felt his cock grow bigger between her tits, and he would have made her feel every inch of him, the head of his hard cock, the thickness of him.</p> <p>But it was not an accident, not at all. Mr Elliot knew Anne's nipples well, even with the way she was getting closer to her orgasm. His fingertips were still inside her bra, though. And it felt good, as if they were trying to escape from his fingers. She was pushing her face down into the window as the pleasure of her wet cleft was sending itself through her body. She was squealing in her pleasure, her breasts, her cunt: her whole body was shaking now, the movement of her buttocks through her skirt, and she was bucking and thrusting herself, while his lips kissed her throat and neck. She would have gone all the way: she had no choice now: her whole body, her whole mind, her whole heart, was writhing with all her energy, her entire being. Or better yet, with all her senses of sight and smell had started to run together. When her first orgasm hit her: her clitoris, her toes, her tits, her nipples: all three she lost all control... When it was over, it was done: her first real orgasm.</p> <p>And then Mr Elliot had kissed her again before she could say anything. If she said anything at all...</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Ellen</p> <p>In the meanwhile Mrs Smith:</p> <p>Ellen. My heart was beating so hard. My legs were trembling, my skin was wet. I was thinking about his lips. I needed him: in there...</p> <p>Mrs Sarah Smith:</p> <p>Oh, Mr Elliot:</p> <p>Oh, Mrs Smith. Yes! I know it was wrong, but I was feeling so sexy and horny, and I couldn't stand it; and I had to stop:</p> <p>Ellen -</p> <p>I was still trembling as I got off the train: I really did want him, but I couldn't stop. But maybe you could be just a little bit more careful!</p> <p>Mr Elliot -</p> <p>It was my idea, but not that much, I don't know, but you can find one on the internet somewhere: it would probably be nice.</p> <p>Mrs Sarah Smith -</p> <p>And she -</p> <p></p> <p>Mr Elliot "Don'temselves</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Ellen Mr - and</p> <p>Ellen</p> <p>"It's</p> <p></p> <p>"Mrs</p> <p></p> <p>Ellen</p> <p>"That would do—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
