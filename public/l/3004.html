"If I</strong> could, or should, allow you to get your cock in my cunt, then that has me thinking of a million times my pleasure this last week. As I write this, my pussy is soaking."</p> <p>My wife, "What a lovely thought", exclaimed. But what's the use of that.</p> <p>I told her we probably could have a threesome with her tonight, and she was surprised.</p> <p>She insisted we get another glass of champagne, but we decided it would save more effort in the morning, so I went back to the study, to play.</p> <p>I awoke to the aroma of rose-scented body odour, and then I felt as if some part of my brain had exploded in a brain freeze, while the light was failing. I must have been lost in a dream, or somewhere like that.</p> <p>I awoke to the sound of a man's voice, "You may rest now, my beautiful wife."</p> <p>His hands came up to her breasts, as he said "I hope you're ready to get out of these clothes. I love your body."</p> <p>I sat back, stunned, staring at the erotic sight, and started to get up.</p> <p>He leaned back and told me, "Don't get up."</p> <p>I stood up, and started to get dressed. As I stepped out of my pyjamas, I could smell his cologne.</p> <p>"Do you like it when I smell you?"</p> <p>"Yes, please. And it's beautiful, sexy and intoxicating." He walked over and gave me a soft kiss, then took my hand in his and led me out of the bedroom, into to the living room. And all the way to the bedroom.</p> <p>He kissed my neck and ear lobes, then I felt him sliding my pyjama bottoms down under my butt, as he slowly and deliberately undressed me. My cock was growing quickly, pushing against the material of my bikini, which I could feel were a perfect fit. I could feel it pressing through the tight fabric, while I felt another pair of fingers running up and down my ass crack.</p> <p>As I stood there a third man came over to me, and knelt down right at where I was standing, his hand slowly running up and down my naked stomach and his fingers teasing my dick through the material of my bathing costume. As he stroked me, I could feel the dampness begin to seep through the top of my bikini. His hands now went all the way up my thighs to my crotch, where his fingers slid over my cock for a moment, and then went back down. I could feel his hands inching themselves lower, down between my legs, to feel where my cock was. My hand went down to my balls and started to massage there as slowly as a cock strokes an ass, and it only took less a second for his hand on my cock to have made its journey. This man could obviously feel the moisture emanating from my body.</p> <p>The other guy began walking across the room and bent over the arm of the chair to take hold onto my right ankle, pulling my leg upwards to put it up onto his shoulder, his body pressing my leg inwards, so my cock was now at the very top of my balls. His lips kissed the underside of my shaft, and he pushed my legs apart as far as possible, as he began to lick my balls. He wrapped his lips around them, sucking them gently, then nibbling them as his hands continued to stroke me.</p> <p>Suddenly the man behind me stood back up, and went on tiptoes up my body, kissing every inch of my upper body as he went, until his face came within inches of mine. I could feel his hot breath on my face as he told me, "You're so beautiful here, my darling."</p> <p>"I'm so tired. We should lie down. It's been too long since we have fucked, anyway."</p> <p>He got off the chair and stood in front of me, putting his arm around my shoulders and pulling me towards him as his other hand slid up my neck to start massaging my chest. He pushed me back against the wall of the study as his hands were roaming. He slid his lips to mine, and for a minute or two, just held me with those sweet kisses, as his hands ran up, down, and stroked down my body.</p> <p>He said with his lips smothering mine, "I'll be good, won't I?"</p> <p>"Of course you will," I replied.</p> <p>He leaned forward and kissed me, with the most sensual, tender kiss possible. We just stood there until he could say it again. I said, "I think I need something to let go."</p> <p></p> <p>That was just kissed and we stepped on the bed. "my knees. "I think we can do it again.
