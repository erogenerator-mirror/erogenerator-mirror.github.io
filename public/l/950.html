For the space of seven years his reputation for virtue had filled</strong> him out and there was no doubting in his wisdom that his son was also into fucking. His brother would be a natural at it.</p> <p>The mayor's assistant in the city was also interested in fucking. He was in deep contemplation. He found it hard to deny that a cock inside him shouldn't take long. The mayor's mind took it all in. But, despite what was going on, it wouldn't have mattered too much. There would be a chance that the mayor might get an erection, but the mayor didn't think he would.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Remy saw the city of Austin a few hours away.</p> <p>The streets were still deserted. The Mayor had a good distance from the city. The lights of the city danced over it. It was easy to tell that there had been a meeting, a conference and a little celebration here. There was a big celebration for the mayor's department. His secretary stood next to him. They spoke little English. The Mayor's secretary was a beautiful woman of about forty. Her breasts were large for her age and very pleasant to look at. She kept her blond hair cropped short. She smiled and waved and waved as he followed her upstairs. They reached the bedroom of the bedroom and he closed the door.</p> <p>"Thank you, Mayor," she said. He was surprised that he hadn't heard any objection when he had gone to the mayor's office.</p> <p>The mayor removed his slacks and shirt. His body was fit. His penis was long and firm. His pubic hair was dark. The mayor's breasts were soft and warm. He had never been one to turn to force. His cock was already hardened. He had been looking forward to fucking some young cunt.</p> <p>The mayor walked over to him and gently rubbed his fingers along the back of his neck. He rubbed it through the tangle of locks of hair there.</p> <p>"Would you like to fuck my young bitch here?" he said.</p> <p>"Yes," he replied.</p> <p>"Please, allow me to get this job done here," the mayor said.</p> <p>"Your pleasure," the mayor said. His mind was made up. It was enough to make him think. Perhaps it was time. He didn't know. How many women could satisfy his cock alone that day? How many men would want to fill the mayor's cunt?</p> <p>"I'll do it," the mayor said.</p> <p>"Just do it for me, young man. My cunt is waiting. It's begging for such a hard fucking," the mayor said.</p> <p>He removed the mayor's coat and threw it on the chair behind him. He stepped back to admire his man. He had a body to die for. Thick, muscular, tall and well-shaped. He had a penis. Perhaps some men's would prefer large cocks like the mayor. One would probably choose bigger ones, but the mayor's penis certainly did have some good shape. He stood with legs spread on the bed. The mayor put one strong arm around his neck and used his other hand to press against his own penis.</p> <p>"I'm going to fuck you," the mayor said. His voice was low.</p> <p>"Yes," he said.</p> <p>The mayor walked over to the window and looked out. The night sky was clear and cool. The sky was very blue. As he looked out, he saw two figures out the window, walking back to the city. They could probably have been a couple. The moon would have been shining behind them, but it was too dark to see. The mayor wondered where his office might be. It was too risky. The mayor wondered if he should just run, but he knew that it was best to stay in the city and be in the mayor's office.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The mayor's face turned scarlet as he saw the office. He wondered how many politicians, police, firemen, military people, cops, policemen, school principals, secretaries, school principals, teachers and even the mayor's secretary would have his office. He was tempted to leave. Perhaps the mayor would be too drunk. Maybe he should stay. Perhaps he should do something else.</p> <p>He walked inside his new office. Everything was set and ready for action. He walked down the hallway to the secretary's office. A man approached.</p> <p>"Mr. Mayor," the secretary said. "I have one little problem today."</p> <p>"What kind of problem?" the mayor asked. "Is this a problem with you?"</p> <p>"You are a politician," the secretary replied. "I am Mr. Mayor."</p> <p>"And I'm afraid I have to attend a meeting," he said. His voice sounded a bit deeper. He wanted to talk to someone else the mayor. . "It is about you, Mr. Let's about me."</p> <p></p> <p>. I don't like now. Now please."</p> <p>. the business—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
