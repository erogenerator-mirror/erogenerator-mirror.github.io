When thou art offended with any man’s transgression, presently</h4><p><strong>reflect upon thyself; and consider what thou thyself art guilty of in the same kind. As that thou also perchance dost think it a happiness either to be rich, or</strong> if thou thee thee of be the best at what thouself doest so thou do not thou in like thou hast to be thou in the same kind.</p> <p>As I say in my letter where I mentioned that you may have wondered if the saying goes that thou thou ought to be blessed with the finest body that can be found, that thou dost have an opinion as to where thou thyselves couldest best lay their bodies upon.</p> <p>And if thou dost know thyself well where thou thyself artest thou?</p> <p>*</p> <p>The sound of her breath against my lips sent me over the edge.</p> <p>I kissed again.</p> <p>I wrapped my arms around her, and pressed her up against the front door.</p> <p>She moaned.</p> <p>I kissed her neck and shoulder, and began to work my way down her chest, kissing along her collar bone while I ran my hands up and down the swell of her breasts.</p> <p>Her hands came up to grasp at my hair, and slowly massage my scalp.</p> <p>I lifted up her hair-red dress.</p> <p>It stopped above her knees, and she quickly stepped out of it and spread her legs, wrapping them around me as I dove between her legs.</p> <p>Once again, if I'm right, I was right.</p> <p>Lips parted, she took my cock in her hand. She had done it, so I knew she knew the way to do it.</p> <p>I felt her legs lock around my body as she lowered me down, taking her pussy down to my shaft.</p> <p>I ran my thumb along her lips, feeling as they parted, and then she took my head into her mouth, sucking on me as I slid into her.</p> <p>My body was already stiffening as her lips wrapped around me, and I watched her mouth as I slowly began moving up and down on her.</p> <p>She moaned as her mouth worked on me, and then I felt her pull my hips down, taking my dick deep inside her.</p> <p>I lifted up her dress, my hands going to the bottom of her hips, and then her legs locked around me once again as I began fucking in and out of her pussy.</p> <p>She was tight, and wet and smooth and warm and incredible.</p> <p>As I fucked her faster and deeper, I could feel her hips working as her hands ran through my hair, rubbing against my neck and shoulders as she came again and again.</p> <p>I kept slowing, and she wrapped her arms around my head, letting me take control of the pace, but then pulled me back to her as her orgasm ended.</p> <p>She let out a sigh, and I felt the heat and tightness of her pussy tighten against me, and I knew I wouldn't last long.</p> <p>*</p> <p>My hands came up and I grabbed at her breasts, feeling her nipples jiggle and swell under my palms.</p> <p>"I can feel the heat of your body," I said as I kissed her neck.</p> <p>Her head fell back as she sighed and moaned while I kept working my dick inside of her while she came.</p> <p>When her orgasm was finally subsiding she lifted her legs off of me, and slowly laid me down as she took her dress off. Then she knelt up and started licking my dick, and working over the head.</p> <p>Her mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, and tongue all felt so wonderful.</p> <p>And as she moved on top of me, working my dick in and out of her mouth, her body moved forward as well, working her pussy against my body.</p> <p>I could feel each of her movements, and the fact that it was her that was so turned on, that she was so hot, but also me that was turning her on.</p> <p>She felt so warm and soft, and I could feel how hard she was against me.</p> <p>She moved herself from me toward me, and I let her as she straddled me.</p> <p>"It seems you have something you want to say, or do," she said as she straddled my lap again.</p> <p>A smile crossed my face.</p> <p>She smiled at me again.</p> <p>"Do you ever go back to being just him?" she asked.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"You are just being a bit strange, and then all the time just looking at me?"</p> <p>"It's not like that at all."</p> <p>She moved forward, and began to rub her hands together so she could work my shaft up and down both of her body, while her mouth and down on mine again she rode me.</p> <p>I let out.
