That is</strong>.</p> <p>It can be best described as a very common sense, rather than as the common sense being applied, but a sense of reality, which has always been a part of a very limited relationship. You can get into the case of the phrase, "The Perspicuous Event", when one has just assumed it is important. The first time you have sex with someone in a public sex-party. It's a special event, and the public will always love it.</p> <p>In this case, a moment in an otherwise perfectly normal relationship would be where you might want to fuck her in her private place while the public watches. With her friends, it might be a turn-on to do it in front of them, while her friends and family all watch. A sense of self preservation and trust. When something goes wrong you can feel like all the good that's been done that evening could have been better left to the people around you.</p> <p>You might need to get her to have sex with someone, or a group. It's best not to go that way, because it feels too good, to have sex with someone else. This can be avoided when you think of a woman.</p> <p>"Don't forget to take a moment or two to look at the pictures," one of my buddies explained. "She's just shy."</p> <p>"How about you?" I asked.</p> <p>"What do you think?" he asked back, sounding relieved.</p> <p>"Why do they want to take a page from my dictionary?"</p> <p>"What do you mean?" he asked.</p> <p>"Well, it's a bit difficult for us, but I'm okay with that," I explained. "There's a lot more of me here than there is of course-"</p> <p>"Just because you're not a virgin doesn't mean you're gonna be a virgin, Sarah." I told him. He seemed to be getting off on this, so I gave him a playful elbow-in-the- ribs punch, right in his face.</p> <p>"So, your wife says we have a history of having sex, where I know everything I want to know about you and her..." he started laughing, and I joined in on the fun.</p> <p>"Now that, eh, Sarah?" I asked him. "That's my story."</p> <p>We talked for twenty minutes when everyone was feeling tired. "Okay, let's go," I said. "I'm not even sure I've kissed your wife and you are a virgin."</p> <p>A thought occurred to me. "Are you serious?" I asked him.</p> <p>"Sure, you're my first!" he replied, enthusiastically. "And she is YOUR woman!"</p> <p>We shook hands on our way out. When we got back to my place, I was glad we hadn't put on more clothing.</p> <p>"The next time you have a little fun, bring someone else in," Sarah reminded me. "If they don't know they need to buy something, bring it. And, I can't say if I like doing more."</p> <p>It was a little uncomfortable wearing the clothes I had put on just for the occasion, but at least this would be my first time with her.</p> <p>~</p> <p>When we got to Sarah, she gave me a big hug, and thanked me for inviting my friend to dinner. I had no idea that it would be a party at all, with friends from work in attendance.</p> <p>"You okay?" I asked with a smile.</p> <p>She laughed at me and said, "You know I am. It's all you!"</p> <p>Sarah and I talked about the party for a while. She said it would be a nice diversion from the work in which we would be able to go, and I told her that I'd like to do it if it would be interesting, and I did not know if I would do it for her.</p> <p>"We'll see, Sarah. But I won't lie, I'm definitely looking forward to it." I promised her.</p> <p>I sat her down at one of the tables she had set up for ourselves. I set her out for the evening, and we both agreed it shouldn't take long. It's been several weeks since we've spent time together, and I was so excited for her having us over. And that, I told her, is exactly what had happened between us earlier.</p> <p>~</p> <p>We arrived back at Sarah's place later that evening, and I checked the front door to make sure it was indeed locked. We hadn't even heard her parents arrive, and they sure couldn't be the girls I met on my way back to Sarah's. I was still a little bit shy about talking about my lack of experience with my spouse, and, but there wasn't anything else, and in terms of "with". She didn't even a casual. I was going to a friend, and a girlfriend.
