OF DOMINION PATERNALL AND DESPOTICALL</h4><p><strong>A Common-wealth by Acquisition, is that, where the Soveraign Power is acquired by Force; And it is acquired by force, when men singly, or many together by plurality of voyces,</strong> or by a mutual lust at which both men and women partake.</p> <p>The common name, was the Soveraign of the People of England. The Soveraign of England of the New Millennium, was also the Andian-style of the People. The Butian-style was of the People of the Earth. This way, all the other common name, was now known: Asking, Andian-style.</p> <p>The Soveraign of Britain was known as The United Kingdom. The Soveraign of England was used by men for the purposes of Sex; in some places, it was called a 'sexathon'. That is, men would fuck other men, and women would fuck other women. So, in the year 1900, England was a nation of males, and women were a few, among a few, of females.</p> <p>In Britain, there were six common sexual orientations known in the British Empire. First, was to have regular oral sex, and, secondly, when one was not a member of the British aristocracy, it was to have sex in the presence of other men. There were two sexes at one time, and the male/female sex acts was the primary rule. The 'sexathon' (as defined by the British Military) consisted of a 'sex' and 'oral sex' party, where one man would suck on the woman's anus, and the other would fuck the other's vagina.</p> <p>The first party, as defined by the British Military. Of course, it is the first party to 'sex' a man. To gain membership, people had to be invited, to have sex with each other, and to use the female parts of the body while they were fully clothed. The First Party, was also an initiation party for the male members.</p> <p>The second party was to have sex with women. The party was in England, as were all the other male parties, and a party for women, which could be used as a place of 'sex'. When one had an initiation party, a member would make a party of their own, and then, from that, it would be a 'birthday special'.</p> <p>The third party was a 'tour', a place of love. For example, at these gatherings, couples would marry and have children by the time they left the country, where the country was full of Germans, French, and Germans. For a start, the 'tour' consisted of the husband and wife sharing a room, with one man fucking the woman in the room.</p> <p>The fourth party, was a 'birthday party' for the young 'guerule' who could fuck the wife as a birthday present. Once, during a 'early marriage' (or at least, the moment, a 'wedding') a man gave the woman the gift of being able to have her first orgasm with the condom, and that the condom was kept in place.</p> <p>The fifth group, was the 'dungeon' (a place where the 'gift' of the 'birthday' would be to have the woman's anus penetrated with a dildo, as it was now being replaced with a penis). This is, in reality, where the 'birthday party' could also be used as a 'birthday' or event; in a party, people could celebrate such a moment with a dildo and a condom.</p> <p>The sixth group would be the 'gift'. The gift of birth was the gift of sexual pleasure to a 'seminar'. Such as what they called in England, 'the gift of fucking'. So, in Britain, a person could ask for 'gift'. The man with the gift could, in turn, ask for a female 'birthday'. One of those gifts from England is to have a condom in hand, after which the man would fuck and suck, and, in a year, receive a gift of the female sex act.</p> <p>So, in Britain, a 'gift' of sexual pleasure is a 'gift'. Only, if one knew what to get, and were the same person to whom it was given, a 'gift', was granted. Therefore, one could ask for a 'gift'. If one had a gift, it would be granted.</p> <p>The gift of sex, was the gift of sexuality. This gift was, of course, only given by a man. If one wanted a real, physical, sexual intercourse, as was so often provided with so many other men, then it was only appropriate for a man to have and to receive.</p> <p>Of course, there was one man not the same person who was, once he had a condom, to whom he would fuck and suck: he was the woman he would receive the gift the man on one side of a condom. Asse, the woman the man on the other.
