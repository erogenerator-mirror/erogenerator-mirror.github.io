Haydée</h4><p><strong>Scarcely had the count’s horses cleared the angle of the boulevard, when Albert, turning towards the count, burst into a loud fit of laughter—much too loud in fact not to</strong> be a true celebration of the world, the world, and its new love.</p> <p>“Where the fuck you been, sonny?”</p> <p>“I’ll be home early,” Jason replied in a sing-song mood.</p> <p>“Come to your bed.”</p> <p>It was my turn to go, but now came back to the present. My parents and older brother had been going at it too long and I wouldn’t mind a little of that now too. They had started by taking me upstairs and fucking me. The best thing about such an activity is that your boyfriends are always available at one moment before the others. They make it too bad that they wouldn’t be fucking me again, so I decided to be a good host.</p> <p>With his clothes off, I was on my knees and he was behind me. I felt his cock being pulled out and then the first thing he did wasn’t for the first time would be take my virginity. He pushed my ass against the dresser and said, “You haven’t done this for so long that it’s a shame you haven’t done this for me, sweetheart.” Then he slammed it back into me and began to really fuck. My parents always made a little joke about how much better I was when I had to pretend I wasn’t in any way the star of their family. And, as soon as we were alone, they talked as if they were in the middle of a long lecture.</p> <p>I remember the first time my parents had asked us to make love, because I was afraid, but in the right mind I thought they wouldn’t give us a piece of advice. Their words and then there they were and we just got it. Jason began to moan in spite of himself as he began to fuck me again. I can only imagine it being our first time, with him telling me to hold it. He started to talk to us about different people while trying his best to keep up with the action, and I could relate to it because our parents just had the perfect rhythm and the best way to keep up with each other. Jason started to pant as he fucked me and I could hear him groaning as he came. A minute later he groaned even louder and started to cry out and his orgasm started. We both had one each and we kissed at first with his hand on my body and then he used my body as the anchor while he was using me. Then he pulled out and rolled on his side and they laid next to each other and were both panting for breath. “That was beautiful,” I said just as tears ran down my cheeks, as I was.</p> <p>“Yeah. That was awesome.”—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
