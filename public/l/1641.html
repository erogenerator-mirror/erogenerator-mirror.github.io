A few more to-morrows, and the party from London would be arriving. It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking of it one morning, as what</strong> would be a glorious time indeed for her and her husband to have sex together, right here in daylight. In the days just after he and Emma's marriage had taken a sudden turn, something seemed to change; he seemed to feel comfortable enough in this new reality, he seemed happier; and she felt more confident about her body and her intentions in life. That, and that, that, that was her sex being fucked.</p> <p>It always started out so romantic, to the exclusion of everything else, but even the best of lovers should know that the best thing is to always be prepared. She wanted to feel good, she always wanted to feel good. She wanted to enjoy the pleasure of being in a bed with another woman. She wanted her husband to love her as much as she did him. And she wanted to get him in bed, too.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The party began at seven, Emma's husband Jonathan, well, the man she loved, was leaving at ten. She'd thought it would have been a romantic walk, but this, her party that had come all this way, and to be having sex together in a tent, seemed like a way for that to end.</p> <p>So she had a little talk with Jonathan, and told him what she wanted him to do with her, and how she wanted him to make love to her. They knew how it would go, and a little part of her told Emma she couldn't keep quiet about that. Jonathan was a perfect gentleman, his eyes had just as much spark back in hers as her husband, and his eyes were as blue as her eyes.</p> <p>What she didn't tell him, that her husband was in the habit of using sex toys on his wife in a hotel room, had to be hard for him to grasp, he always did. If there was a chance of making love with Emma, there was a hundred times more chance than not, if not better, than it was to have sex with her, if she wanted him now. The two of them got on for a while, and then Emma got dressed, and he put his stuff in his bag.</p> <p>They got up to leave together, her in her gown, him in his trousers, so Jonathan and Emma didn't notice his shoes. They just kissed goodnight, and walked arm in arm all the way, but Emma could feel Jonathan's erection, and Emma just managed to get that through his trousers and his hand up inside of her dress. Jonathan looked as though he was about to come, so Emma sat in her lover's chair, pulled off her dress, and gave him the best blowjob ever.</p> <p>His hands, which he'd just been fondling, and which she never stopped making, reached in her panties as soon as he pulled them off, and he fucked her with his fingers until she screamed with sheer pleasure, and he came inside of her, not once, but twice, of course, for at least thirty minutes. It made her happy, too, it felt as though he had done it before. She still wanted him.</p> <p>They came into a bedroom, he still fully dressed, and they stripped quickly, so she could play. And they were fucking. The idea of having sex with her husband, even if it was only the second time, had not even crossed her mind. She knew she wanted it more than that. She'd be making love with her husband to him, and if she'd had sex with her lover, and had taken the idea for herself, the same with her husband.</p> <p>She felt Jonathon's lips on hers in the darkness, and he tasted different. Their tongues found a way to the other's mouth where they'd been kissing, and they touched, and kissed and touched in a way that could only be made by intercourse. His fingers felt good on her as they fucked, but was always gentle. Emma found that the feeling of her body pressed against his as he fucks her felt as if she'd had sex with her husband in the car; but she'd never admit that to him.</p> <p>She was about to leave when her lover brought his cock to her, his face just in front of hers, and she parted her lips. His hands were on her knees, and he opened her pussy with the tip of his penis. Emma closed her eyes and let Jonathan fuck her, but she had to hold on to the bed, otherwise he might come, but it could wait and she didn't want him to, so just let Jonathon do all the work.</p> <p>It felt so sexy, watching him, feeling him, as he drove his cock up into her. Her pussy was so tight and he was so hard, even though it was just the second time of that they'd just had. It felt good, that, because her body, and a long time, even as they were just like that, as they had moved on both of them, they had gone through her own bodyâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
