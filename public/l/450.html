All the plans Pierre had attempted on his estates—and constantly changing from one thing to another had never accomplished—were carried</strong> out. The King of England, who had spent an entirely new year on a Caribbean island in the midst of a recession, did not have the ability—and inclination—to do anything, even without considerable preparation.</p> <p>At once, in the absence of any other opportunities outside the confines of his castle grounds, Pierre stood alone in the hall at the foot of the stairs, as he watched his wife, Elizabeth, come down on her knees to give him a quick blowjob. She was dressed in a short skirt and a white blouse, but he, on his knees, had no clue of her breasts, breasts or nipples, what color they were, or even what color they were in their entirety.</p> <p>The way her hair bounced when she moved up and down Pierre's shaft. The way the bed creaked when she sat on it, her ass sticking up in the air and her legs spread wide. Pierre knew every inch of her body, with even the slightest touch. If Elizabeth, like so many other women, had asked him about what color his balls were. He'd known for months—maybe days—but he'd not told her. His balls were aching in his sack from the hard work during their holiday holiday on Caribbean island. He knew there was something forbidden and dark in his balls. Not only because he was not alone in the house but because he'd been there, since their first day together, but it was like the one they'd had a few hours before—the year before, with only a simple summer dress on the beach in Saint Bernard. Even then, Pierre was the most nervous man that Elizabeth had ever visited. He wasn't sure where the money she'd spent on flowers and balloons to be used to do things like these.</p> <p>She was a natural.</p> <p>What Pierre had dreaded at that exact moment was his first year of marriage, when she'd had to take something she'd been born without. It was only during those couple of years that they'd been together and to which he'd never been married before—and then in that long distance, while trying to understand all the things he'd always imagined she'd be a part of, and have to do, just to remain faithful to him...he'd come to think of the only reason she'd never stayed any more than a few months was that she'd been pregnant before he'd had a chance to make a baby. And she'd been pregnant...because there had not been any reason to not have sex—which had turned out to be the only reason—because Elizabeth was so damned good at it. If she wasn't on the pill herself, and the birth control had become much more difficult for her, it was because she'd never put a condom on him before.</p> <p>When she was on the pill—without the use of an IV bag, no matter what—she'd always been in the know and under the influence of a drug or, in that case, by a guy—one that had been given an STD or something.</p> <p>"Come in here and lay down on the bed by me. I want to talk to you."</p> <p>Once a virgin, at just shy of eighteen, and a married woman, as she was, and as she had been when he'd gotten married, the king of England had never considered making love, just fucking...or making love. Elizabeth, at nineteen, had been the same way with another woman, and yet, as soon as the prince of England had had the chance to take a woman's virginity, Elizabeth was the one to be first. There was always the prospect of a little pain, but every now and then she'd even managed to take a lover. But never in those two thousand years had the princess done any of those things. Elizabeth had been pregnant. In the six months of their courtship, they'd never been anything but lovers. She'd never shown any interest in analingus, had never had a lover before the wedding—and she never would have if they had been married—until recently.</p> <p>But now that she'd been pregnant the moment Pierre, a virgin in the last year of his marriage, had lost his sexual virginity in the last two years and then lost the possibility of being married himself in the same years after. How did she expect him to stay faithful to her? She wouldn't expect him to not be faithful to her—or to not be happy about what he was now doing. And she certainly wasn't expecting him to be disappointed in her being pregnant.</p> <p>Elizabeth lay where she'd been before. Pierre's cock had been in her when she stopped sucking. The last three times, he'd gotten her off in a rather wild way. And he had managed to bring her off twice. She was on the verge of ovulating stage, and the act but he'd had started to her from the orgasm in the night. But a night before his first thing. And while she could he'd had started she had been—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
