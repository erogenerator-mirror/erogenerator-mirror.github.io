I was well known for my bookkeeping; my time was precious. I did what I did best: I used the book to fill the gaps in the coursebooks.</p> <p>Being a bookkeeper for a fraternity of students was one of the most popular and rewarding things I had ever done. Although, as you will see, I wasn't one of the typical bookkeepers but I was something of a bookworm. The campus was all on the books. As a booker, I was constantly aware of what books to listen to or read. I was a book worker as well, although for a guy of my school I did not like the way school books are always written and I preferred that to writing a book.</p> <p>The first day of classes was one of my best. I had the day off from studying for my coursework and I was sitting in the Professor of Sociology for our class.</p> <p>When class was over I went out and walked toward the door to my apartment. It was a nice day and the house looked like it might be empty. I thought to myself; you have to have a good place to stay that day.</p> <p>I went in the apartment and I walked to my room. I closed and locked the door as I started to get undressed. I pulled my clothes off and then I laid on my bed in just my panties. My fingers gently stroked across my breasts before I covered them with a sheet under my body. I had taken on the role of a bookkeeper all through my life and so far I had felt very comfortable sitting by myself at home in my room while reading a book.</p> <p>I pulled on my bra, knowing that under my breasts were not what attracted men to me. As I put my panties on I realized that underneath my breasts I was still quite beautiful. I looked down to see my nipples showing clearly through my light pink bra. I pulled my panties on and pulled my skirt up over my hips to cover myself again. With one hand I pulled on my nipples through my bra so that they became swollen. I felt wonderful! I pulled my bra and panties back so that I could slip on my skirt and get into bed.</p> <p>As I walked back to the apartment block I noticed the number on my phone. The sender was my favorite one. I looked at the phone screen again and I felt like I wanted to dial it. I pulled it from under the bed. It turned out it was a special text message from Mr. Miller.</p> <p>It took a bit of pulling to get it working. I was getting more aroused as my mind imagined him calling me. And of course, I felt very nervous about calling him. When I pulled it from underneath my bed I was so excited that I felt my nipples harden under my bra. Suddenly, I felt incredibly horny and I started to rub my nipples through my bra. I pulled my bra away from my body and I began to rub the small bumps that were becoming visible through my bra. I moaned on the phone and I began to rub my breasts for him.</p> <p>I closed my eyes briefly and I began to imagine his mouth on my body. My fingers rubbed my hard nub as I imagined that big cock deep inside me.</p> <p>I was getting very turned-on in my mind right then. I opened my eyes, trying to think of him. I turned my back to the phone and I imagined touching myself through my bra.</p> <p>I wanted it. Then I pulled my bra off and moved down to my bed. I laid down on the bed and grabbed my phone. I reached into my dresser and pulled out my vibrator and began to roll it over my breast. The vibrating felt good on my body. I laid there rubbing my nipples and rubbing my vibrator over my breasts. The harder I rubbed the harder I rolled the vibrator.</p> <p>The phone vibrated for a while as I continued to roll my nipples faster and harder. The harder I rubbed my nipples the faster I rubbed the vibrator. I was really getting turned on as I rubbed my nipples and rubbed the vibrator against my pussy. I moaned and I felt my breath quicken as I kept working my nipples and vibrator with my other hand. I felt my clit get erect in my hand as I moved the vibrator and rubbed my pussy harder and harder.</p> <p>I felt my body begin to shake as I orgasmed. My mouth hung open in an effort to speak as my body shuddered in orgasms. Then my body shut down. I rolled over the vibrator back to the other side and got up and down to my bedside. We both my legs and my knees were soaked in the bed. I lied there was the vibrating and my body. I removed the pleasure was satisfiedâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
