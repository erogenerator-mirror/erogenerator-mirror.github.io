Rider Haggard </h3><h4>CHAPTER VII The Quelling of the Storm</h4><p><strong>They set me on board a great ship, on the prow of which were images of certain gods of the Phœnicians, called by the Greeks Pataeci, not unlike to that</strong> of the Greeks I am sure, the ones that we are now learning were gods of our times, who worshipped us. In fact the god of the seas, and that is what we thought ourselves to be a myth the Egyptians believed were true, was Phalus and the gods I was to assume were actually Phalus.</p> <p>We spent one hundred years riding the sea in worship of these gods.</p> <p>To start out the next time you go to a temple, in the PhÅnician tongue I will call it, it was the tongue of Aphrodite... the tongue of Euphrodites, the goddess of love, the kiss of the god of love is not something we are always ready for but when it does start to work - well for us the tongue is always ready to do this.</p> <p>One night we had a party at my place. It was very nice, a party. I had rented a nice place on a very beautiful Mediterranean terrace overlooking a sea-facing city, as it was close to the harbor I had visited before, in the course of my travels, I felt as if I was being invited to one of several parties on the island of St. Peter. After an hour of having had a few drinks I decided it was time to take it a little further - to experience an altogether different way to pleasure a woman - one of her friends who is very good at it too. I invited the girls to join me and they happily accepted, as we were the only ones here at all.</p> <p>The first thing we did was to do some kissing. When the others joined us I could feel them getting a little flushed with arousal. We were all in robes and robes that barely reached halfway down to the floor all around us. As the others joined us in kissing, their clothes started to drop and soon they were naked. I felt my nipples start to tingle a little, and they started to swell. They kissed some of each others breast, and I could feel the erect nipples of the first girls.</p> <p>This time I wanted more. I wanted some action. I wanted them to take their clothes off too. I also wanted to take my own clothes off, but also had to have the other girls naked too.</p> <p>After they kissed some more I noticed that for the first time in a long time our tongues were in an asexual union. I decided to have a little something for them too. I put my mouth on their lips and gently probed them with my tongue, which they started to do with urgency, which I took as my signal to do the same with the other. Then I moved my lips to another girl's nipple and started to kiss and suck it too. With the third girl kissing me I moved my lips to the next girl's other nipple, which I could feel the nipples tingling in response to my oral work. That took another two hours, and they could not have lasted that long. When I kissed down the last girl's body I could not resist to move down between the thighs, which I saw were just as moist as those of the others, but where my heart was racing, I could not have been more surprised as to what I saw... a beautiful naked girl with a pussy that was already ready to be pleasured.</p> <p>I lay back in the chair and gently took the girls' body, running my hands all over her body and spreading the lips to get into touch every part of her that I could, which were already ready for me also. I lowered mine to her, licking at her, sucking the breast I sucked on hard. I pressed my face hard against hers, and she responded by lifting her knees, parting them, to give me even better access to her sex. She moaned as my tongue found her clitoris and her breasts. I was not prepared to perform oral sex on another woman's body, especially given I had just witnessed it. I licked her there very gently and she responded with moans of pleasure, and I could hear the wet sound as her juices ran down my own chin and stomach. I found her clitoris under my tongue and she moaned again and I was ready to come. I felt her body start to twitch, and I felt it starting to tighten up. And then I started to suck on her, wanting to make her come as soon as possible too. She seemed to like it too, and she was soon thrashing around in the chair, getting very aroused. She came almost as soon as she came.</p> <p>And then she moved and kissed me again, sharing her juices with me as we kissed. It was a first for me to be able to make out such a beautiful female body. I kept my lips around hers gently as I let her move under me, and in time to feel the muscles move to her next orgasm.</p> <p></p> <p>'n 'our' to 'n 'n we move</p> <p>n 'n—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
