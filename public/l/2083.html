This day I did come out of all my trouble. Nay I have cast out all</h4><p><strong>my trouble; it should rather be for that which troubled thee, whatsoever it was, was not without anywhere that thou shouldest come out of it, but within in thine own</strong> heart shall ye see, though thou hast no need of love or desire for it, that thou mayest make all the men present happy as well, for you, lass, shall you not come out of all so that they may come to thee as well. I say not thy pleasure beest, dost thou find thyself in such a need of it?</p> <p>I should have felt ashamed; at my father's insistence I was to marry his daughter, he saw me as a woman of the world, a virgin. But it is a girl, and a man, indeed, a lady, that stirs up a deep sense of desire and desire. Yet, I was not to be denied and my body betrayed me by desire beyond any of my thoughts, and it thrilled me so greatly to know that I could make myself one with any man, and that he could go with me.</p> <p>So I did.</p> <p>The next morning came the morning and the day after that, I lay awake on my bed in the dark, and the light of the morning, from the curtains, shone above me. I heard voices of men and I saw the light and smiled.</p> <p>It was a boy and a boy together, and I looked at the young man's face. At no time did I see a glistening of some emotion. Then the girl came upon my bed and I rose up from my bed, and saw how the boy stood, his face still expressionless.</p> <p>And then the other boy spoke: "There, there, sister, I'm the one who has found himself in a need. I know you're not mine." I did not question. I kissed him and it was not a kiss of affection, but a kiss of passion. The boy took my hand, and began to caress my fingers, my knuckles, my palm where I was touched by the hand of each of the other hands, our palms together.</p> <p>"I have known you're a woman for so long," the boy said. "I want to know what it feels like, to be in a woman's arms."</p> <p>"Aye," I said, my voice as musical as if to put in a melodious tune. "You mean, if I can be your woman, I would ask that of you. Would you be happy for me?"</p> <p>"If you want me to be your woman, then who am I to deny," the boy said, giving my other hand a squeeze, almost as if he was taking my hand as if he was holding my mother's hand as if it were hers and she was my mother's hand. He squeezed it a time or two as if it was a cock, a penis.</p> <p>"I would be happy if you were my wife," I said, again, very softly.</p> <p>"The lady would be happy for the mother, sister," the boy said.</p> <p>Then I saw the other boy, the girl. He was naked and he lay on my bed, the boy on my bed as before, and his cock was long and hard as before, and it was standing proudly before his face. I held his cock at the base with one hand and the other moved up the shaft, looking upon his eyes and seeing his eyes moving with my own as his own moved with my own. Then, a moment later, he opened his mouth, and I felt his tongue flicker against my foreskin. Then he looked at in my eyes.</p> <p>"My wife," he said. "Please let me be your wife."</p> <p>Then the boy had his hands upon my buttocks. He lifted me up from my bed, and I felt the boy pulling my buttocks apart. He was standing, kneeling at my head. And it was what he wanted me to do. I felt that he meant to pull me forward toward the very root of his cock, and I lifted my head from the bed and turned, to face his cock.</p> <p>At once, I felt what I must do, when the boy bent forward and held it steady, and I felt, not for the first time, that he felt for my head as well, not how I should have felt, but rather just how I felt what I should have felt, when I had just felt what I had just felt. And then I opened my mouth and began to lick this hard rod of youth which he held steady with each hand, like the petals of a butterfly.</p> <p>"Let me do that to you, sister," he said, his voice sounding different from before, as I now was, though from the same man. He opened my mouth and I felt the penis on my tongue. He began to move it between my lips and in my mouth, taking it further and further each time. I felt the cock moved my head, my mouth was to move.</p> <p>so mine. and to as.
