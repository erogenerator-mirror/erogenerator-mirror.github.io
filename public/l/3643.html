She lay stretched out on her stomach, my eyes admiring her pert naked bum. I had removed my shorts and my cock was hard as rock, and straining against my trousers. She had her eyes closed, one leg tucked up under her. I ran my hands up and down her calves and thighs, feeling her skin rippling as I touched her. I'd taken off my shirt and she was lying back. I slipped my hands up to her waist and slowly ran them over the soft, pink flesh of her stomach. Her skin was silky and smooth to the touch.</p> <p>My fingers were on either side of her belly button, and I ran them back down to her pussy. My fingers were wet, and her scent was so sweet. She parted her legs a little, and I slipped a finger into her warm, wet pussy. I stroked her back, down, around to her bum.</p> <p>She squirmed and rolled her bum against my hand. I slid a second finger into her and she moaned at the pleasure. I slipped a third finger inside her, feeling her warm, moist walls squeeze them as I slid them in and out of her.</p> <p>I had to have her now. I wanted so bad to be between her legs with my cock hard, buried up to the hilt in her wet, velvety cunt.</p> <p>I slid two fingers from her cunt to her bum hole. She clenched and convulsed as I rubbed her clit and slid my fingers around her anal opening. I slipped two fingers out her bum hole and slid them up inside her wet pussy. Back and forth back and forth.</p> <p>I ran a fingertip around it. She'd pulled her legs back and apart. I could feel her bum opening and closing, then parting once more to offer her the entrance to her body.</p> <p>"Mmmmhmmm", she murmured quietly as I probed her up and down with my fingers. I kissed her neck. I ran a fingertip down her stomach and over her pubic mound. Gently, I started to slip my fingers around her clit. Her body twitched as my finger slid around. She started to rub her clit with her fingers.</p> <p>Suddenly, she cried out and she had a second violent orgasm, with a gush of warm cum dripping wetly down between her firm breasts. She kept on rubbing her clit as her orgasm continued; one wave after another. I kept on going and I could almost feel my fingers sliding in and out of her pussy.</p> <p>I slid my fingers back into her and began to massage her pussy. I slid a third finger into her so that she could feel more of my fingers entering her body. I could finger her hard, and let her feel the full length of my fingers inside her. I rubbed her clit and circled her opening. She pushed back against my fingers inside as I pushed in and out, as I slipped a fourth finger inside her.</p> <p>She squirmed and writhed as she tried to wriggle away, not with fear or fear of anything but pleasure. I slipped a fourth finger inside her and stroked her insides, moving inside her, stroking her blood, her skin, everywhere it touched. She pushed back and forth on my fingers as my thumb circled her clitoris again and again.</p> <p>Finally, I slid a fourth finger into her and she pushed back onto my hand which still worked slowly in and out of her wet pussy.</p> <p>"I'm going to, I'm," she hissed breathlessly as her orgasm came to an end. "No more," she cried as her body twitched and convulsed on my hand.</p> <p>I pumped fingers back into her and brought my thumb round to press against her clit, and as my hand did this I slipped a finger into her anus. She tensed and suddenly stopped wriggling.</p> <p>I slid my fingers out of her and she flopped back down on the sand. She opened her legs and beckoned me up.</p> <p>I lifted her legs and slid back down the beach. I'd felt her warm pussy as it had been earlier, but now I just held my cock at the entrance of her body. She was wet and slippery with her juices, and my cock slid into her easily. We both gasped at the sudden sensation from deep inside us.</p> <p></p> <p>We had made lovemaking love, and I know love, made time.</p> <p></p> <p>You know love, in we didn't</p> <p>we don't you had I'mn't, love.</p> <p>I love, didn't—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
