For many years, we've stood together here with her, and we never want to leave. For so long, we've been there together.</p> <p>The world stood still as her hand touched me. It was as if an instant before, she had moved in. There was no hesitation or hesitation, this was that moment. She took me. I was her lifeline. My life and my time were at her service, and she was my guardian angel. I had seen the world as she had, the world was the same as all the others; a world where the world was beautiful and vibrant but the world was not. Nothing that could hurt or hurt her could ever harm us.</p> <p>I held her face in my hands, kissing her, as my penis penetrated her, as my member plunged deep inside her. I looked into her eyes and saw the sparkle of hope. In that moment, in that moment, there was love, warmth, peace, joy, and passion to be found within us. What was I supposed to be? The one who could save this world and raise this world higher than the clouds?</p> <p>With a final kiss, I slid my cock from there, as my penis came out of her. She lay on the ground, panting, her chest heaving, looking at me wide-eyed. Our fingers met, we smiled, and we kissed each other. We never stopped. We never stopped. There was nothing else in the world but this moment.</p> <p>With my free hand, I found her head, and guided it to my cock. There, she looked up at me with those big beautiful brown eyes and smiled. She sucked me into her mouth. There is nothing sweeter than the feeling that's achieved by lips on cock. I watched the love of my life suck my cock. A blowjob from an angel?</p> <p>From the moment I got that chance to meet, to meet this woman that made me feel like my life could have come to an end. For the first time, I felt that love and that trust.</p> <p>I lay down on the ground, and she climbed up, straddled, and guided my cock into her. She lowered herself, impaled myself on my rigid phallus, and raised herself as high as she could. I looked down at her. Her face was pure beauty. Her eyes were beautiful blue, and her lips were sweet. Her breasts were full and round. Her body was perfect, and I felt a sense of pride in the weight of those wonderful breasts atop her rib cage. I leaned down. I took a nipple into my mouth. I put a hand to her stomach, and felt myself sliding up her body. She closed her eyes, and my lips found hers again.</p> <p>She kissed me back. I kissed her with passion and joy.</p> <p>I reached under her with my hand, and caressed her clitoris, and she cried out and her body jostled.</p> <p>"Oh, God!" the angel, the goddess. She threw her head back, and her arms shot up to her breasts. God, I wish I could have been there, that we could have come together again, that our bodies could be joined. Those big tits were mine, hers are mine. We're connected.</p> <p>She was screaming. I was crying. I'm sure she was screaming. Our first night here together. How could I be so sure of that?</p> <p>The love of my life and her, the love of her and me, the angel.</p> <p>And there is all that other world, of God, of what we are doing, for this is what we do, and we want.</p> <p>What would we have—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
