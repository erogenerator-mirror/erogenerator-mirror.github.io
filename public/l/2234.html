The way I did it, at 5' 8" I had a fairly muscular build, so when I was fucking her she was always trying to make room for me in her life. I used to think I was super sexy: big, solid and solid. My name? What's that? "Kathleen Parker" was our surname to pronounce our surname.</p> <p>I started by just fucking Kathleen, the woman I loved more than anything in the world. That's a name we'd have to remember, it's a name of love and beauty that never changes.</p> <p>Since we'd been living together for nearly three years I'd developed a routine. This was not a habit we indulged in by sleeping in the same bed.</p> <p>We'd fucked every day. And, in just over three days, both of us had gained at least eight pounds, making it virtually impossible to leave my boat and my clothes.</p> <p>Kathleen was my girlfriend's best friend, and we'd spent nearly a week in the same bed.</p> <p>Her roommate in her room had just come out of her bedroom to see what was going on, apparently because the person who held the door was a different woman than who she had before.</p> <p>Ahem. Well, they could all have been mistaken. I was the one holding the door open, and I'd probably only be one more inch taller than the lady who was holding it. Still, she gave me a sign I could be trusted to enter or leave, and I could leave her room.</p> <p>I was sitting on her bed watching her undress. She turned toward me. She'd already taken off her bra, which was something we had never considered before. She took her panties off, and I could see her pubic hair: small and fine, but the pubic hairs were a shade of dark brown. As I stared at her pussy, she kicked off her shoes. Then I watched her remove her bra, and her firm breasts with their small, pink nipples were exposed.</p> <p>Now, she was a big girl, but she was also very beautiful. And so was I. She was the kind with whom I was completely attracted to.</p> <p>As we stood before each other, naked, her body, which had already been shaved by a razor, was even more beautiful than it had last time. I felt the first twinge of arousal in my cock, which had been hidden under several layers of clothes.</p> <p>Kathleen smiled at me, as she dropped to her knees to touch the head of my cock. Our clothes had been ransacked to shreds all day, in the middle of the yard, by dozens of people, a single car, a dozen buses, and a truck. We were both totally nude, which was exactly what our neighbors would have expected from a house with thousands of people.</p> <p>Kathleen brought me the head of my aching cock in her mouth. I don't know what she thought of all this: how I'd loved to start off being gentle and gentle with her—I never had been. Her lips were warm, wet, and inviting. I could have come in her mouth, but we'd been living together for the past year, and my mind was already trying to figure out how I could keep from just cumming in her mouth.</p> <p>I was aching for her to swallow it at the same time and I was surprised when I felt her swallow.</p> <p>"It tastes like a virgin pussy," she said, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand.</p> <p>I'm no virgin myself. I have no idea what she would do if she saw me now, and she looked at me as if she were about to bolt. She was staring at my cock, not at mine. It wasn't really necessary for her to look. She reached out her hand, and I could tell from her nervousness that she wanted to do something—that a girl would do this. Not just stroke my cock, but use it as a play toy, like a dildo, to keep it hard.</p> <p>That didn't work. She seemed determined not to, as she quickly moved her hand to my cock.</p> <p>"It's too big," she said, as she held the head of my cock as carefully as she could. "Let me take some of it."</p> <p>And she did, but only slowly, rubbing the tip of my cock on her lips before she slid down onto it, making me gasp with ecstasy, and then she began sliding up and down.</p> <p>Kathleen, with her pussy only inches away from my cock, was an experienced kisser. She knew what she wanted. She took the tip of my cock into her mouth one end of her tongue, then both. was slowly, and her tongue touching it, tongue and gently, and touching and kissing and then rubbing, moving on the other ways. of kissing, lips in a touch and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
