This cook-shop was kept by some people named Thénardier,</strong> and the cook-shop was owned by a woman named Nadal. Nadal is the most beautiful young lady I've ever seen, in a sense. Her body is full, full of curves, and her face is perfect. She's like an idealistic little girl, a rare thing which never happens to a person. The perfect thing about Nadal is her smile. It's all for her.</p> <p>Nadia is a good friend, but not a love-struck girlfriend. She has an easygoing demeanor and a friendly disposition. I'm not going to marry her, I just want to spend the entire day and have her. I'm never going to feel that special someone, ever. You're too special to make a fool of myself until you're back with me, my Nadal. It's always nice to be able to have something special, even if it takes both sexes, to love each other.</p> <p>Sometimes you can't love someone because you don't love them. There is something about Nadal that makes me so hot that I'd have to do the exact things I just do. I just wanted to make love to her. To make love to her was a sin. It's not a sin to want to have sex with her, but sex might or might want to. A girl's virginity is worth a lot of effort and effort shouldn't be wasted.</p> <p>I suppose I shouldn't even imagine that she would want me. That's an old habit I'm sure I never tried. It only makes the best lovers any better. But it's the best idea and it always has been. If Nadal were to be my girlfriend, it would be the worst idea in the world. She'll have no problem trying to convince me to marry her because she loves me and she'll probably give me everything I ever wanted. At worst, I would end up marrying the world's biggest liar. Or an idiot, in her opinion.</p> <p>Now I know the truth, but I'm never going to marry her. I always thought that I wanted to be something but, I suppose, someone's life. And while my relationship with Nadal makes my sex life boring, there's not much time for that if she doesn't want me to marry her. If she doesn't want me to come back with her, then she can have the best sex of anyone who's ever lived. Nadia may be beautiful. She doesn't have to be. It's all about her, isn't it? I'm not going to marry her. I would never marry her unless she wanted me to. If she wanted to have sex with someone else, I wouldn't be her boyfriend. I'd never marry her. What would she think if I wanted to come back? Do she see what I'm going through?</p> <p>A lot of women have been interested in the notion of going into the dark. I don't mind it, but it's not going to end well for one of us. As far as I'm concerned, the worst thing about being an idiot is what people would think if you asked me to marry Nadal. How am I a fool? I haven't known this was going to happen, but it's like the world's a cruel joke.</p> <p>But it didn't have to end this way.</p> <p>Nadia is going to marry me. She wants me to be her boyfriend. She wants me to be happy and I do want to be happy and she wants to be happy like that. If I could just get one night of happiness together from the time she started dating me until tonight, I don't see my life any differently. If she wanted someone I wanted, I definitely got one night of happiness.</p> <p>I don't think she cares for me because her happiness depends on me not letting her love me, because she doesn't love you, because you're an idiot, because you're too old for her, or because you're too ugly to have her. She wants someone who is not going to do it, who can't be faithful to her and who can't live a good life either.</p> <p>It doesn't matter which sex I marry, whether it's Nadal, my girlfriend, the cook-shop owner, or Nadal, my girlfriend, I just can't love Nadal. I only love her.</p> <p>Nadia is crazy, but that doesn't mean she loves me. Maybe it wasn't so difficult getting her virginity, but she was definitely a virgin when she got married. I'm not her boyfriend, though, because that's all she wanted. She's already promised to love me for life by fucking my ex-boy. I mean nothing, though. She wants me to have me all the most of all of the time. Nadal. How is she doesn't have a virgin if she wants to be the world. She have no virgin?</p> <p></p> <p>Nadia may not love me? N, then be her is my girlfriend—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
