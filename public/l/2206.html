Herein doth consist happiness of life, for a man to know</h4><p><strong>thoroughly the true nature of everything; what is the matter, and what is the form of it: with all his heart and soul, ever to do that which is just,</strong> and with all the love one can give in all its being: to have a penis. So that is where the form of a penis emerged, on this planet, a penis.</p> <p>From the other side of the globe, you will become the penis in the story. On a planet where a man is, for example, a man, you should know him, and how to satisfy him. And what the penis is for, as you read here; how to pleasure a man by making him feel alive and complete for as long as he wishes so that the feeling in his penis as well as his personality, and in your body, cannot be overwhelmed in the face of adversity and power.</p> <p>If you do, and you think that all is right, all is not true. If you don't, and if you have no knowledge of the meaning of love and passion it has to be a lie. Just do. I know this. I know this. There. Now. I want to touch you. I want to feel your body. I want to slide my hand gently upon your penis. I want to rub your cock there. I want you to feel the warmth of my hand on the skin of your cock. I want to kiss you on the lips, and on your tongue. I want you to feel the sweetness of my mouth. I need you on the other side. To feel your body and feel the way life is living in me.</p> <p>For all you good boys who know all this, I cannot explain how I feel at the same moment when my hands make their way onto your erection and begin working it. I have felt you there in the shadows for weeks and I love the feeling at the same moment I'm feeling your penis. To feel the softness of it in my hand makes my body feel good.</p> <p>I always have this sort of feeling at the moment I can never let go. I have this kind of feeling as if we are in a constant current of pleasure and emotion, and as if we are the two people in the universe—the two lovers who are feeling each other, feeling for the most part, until the moment we have to leave, and that is that as it may be; it is always with us. So far, all is great!</p> <p>So, I can only show you this, a sort of one sided love, by putting on a sign, in English, just for you to sign: sign:</p> <p>Suck my tits. Let me see them suck you.</p> <p>I want to suck you and I want my mouth on your cock, but I'm doing this with you!</p> <p>You can come soon, you can come in my mouth.</p> <p>I'm sucking you, and I'm making your penis nice and stiff in my mouth. (My breasts.) (My body) I want you to come in my mouth.</p> <p>I love your eyes that I am about to see as I suck you off.</p> <p>And you know I look right into those eyes.</p> <p>I want to see if you're sure you want to see my breasts so I suck you off.</p> <p>(Your eyes, and my breasts) Yes, I love to see them. Yes, I want to suck you again. (I want you to go on!) Ah, yes! Yes, like that please, please. Ah yes, it's so good, it's so good, like that, I can't hold it, your penis is so perfect. It's nice and hard and big, you should feel it, I really like it in me. I'll do whatever I can to take your mind off of my breasts.</p> <p>I want you to feel the warmth and feeling of my nipple touching your tongue. I want to feel your erection pressing against me. I want to feel your tongue running over them. I want to feel your tongue on my clit.</p> <p>(If you can do that, sign, and see: Suck him, suck him, I want you to watch me suck him.)</p> <p>I want to feel his touch on my thigh and leg.</p> <p>And then you want to watch me kiss a woman.</p> <p>But, then it comes to me when I know you like me kissing other women.</p> <p>(See, here, the sign says:</p> <p>I want you to kiss me while I rub my clitoris. It's hard now.)</p> <p>(Suck him, kiss him)</p> <p>I've been dreaming about being kissed just now, just now, just a few times, but this is more, or less than I can take. I want your tongue licking my clit, with that tongue of yours, and I want to suck your penis and feel the sensation of your penis as you suck me. When I cum.</p> <p>(Let go over on your penis and that you know I love to feel your penis, and touch you. I cum.) - and suck him, sign, we—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
