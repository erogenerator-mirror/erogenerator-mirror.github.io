Rider Haggard </h3><h4>CHAPTER IV The Kiss of Fate</h4><p><strong>There came a man to Philæ. Watching from a pylon top whither I had gone to pray alone, I saw him land upon the island and from far off noted</strong> 'That man is really the only name. Oh, what God has made him with His divine creation!' I stood at the far end of the ocean and I was thinking, "Yes, I know what you want to ask me to do, I guess I should stop there."</p> <p>I did feel the strong tug of a hard shaft and I saw my hands shaking, as someone pulled me to shore and a very handsome man came down to take my place. But, not for long. Someone had brought my clothes back and I felt a little of his essence sliding onto my skin. I knew it was the man but as I gazed up at him from my position on the water I felt his hands begin kneading my flesh. As he moved his body upwards he placed a hand on my left breast, rubbing his fingers around my areola as he leaned closer to take a deeper look at me. I took a deep breath and found myself arching my back and my knees shaking. His eyes were closed and his body was moving in time to mine. I felt a warm liquid that was flowing over my body. It started at the top of my breasts and rolled down each side of my torso. He lifted his body and I felt the warm liquid roll to the underside of my breast and drop down to my cleavage. This had an unusual effect on me. I closed my eyes, feeling some of the warmth roll across my breast and down between my legs. I started rubbing my fingers through my own juices to add to the liquid.</p> <p>Philæ placed his fingers on the insides of both my breasts and slid them upward to my nipples. I felt something cold and wet touch one of my breasts, making me jerk and a sudden, intense chill ran through my body. As he continued rubbing my breasts, he ran his fingers along my upper front to the waistband of my shorts. The heat of his hand on my sex made me shiver in a way that I didn't realize it at the time and I wasn't really sure how to react. I looked up at him as his gaze made me feel like a woman, feeling that warm feeling in a way that felt a little like a lover's hot skin. I reached out and touched him as he worked over my breasts. I felt him sliding my shorts open as his hand slid over my slit, sliding into my moistness to find a hot, wet pussy waiting for a man to satisfy. Phil did not disappoint. He stroked his long, thin fingers up and down the length of my slit then slid his fingers through my juice to rub over my clit.</p> <p>As his fingers continued to massage my clit I felt my back arch as his finger rubbed against my opening. It felt incredible sending my body into orbit. I looked down and couldn't help but wonder if it would be possible to touch a man. His finger found there way to slide into me and I saw him smile. "You see man, the way you feel feels much more comfortable than a hand job."</p> <p>"Oh god," I thought to myself, "That is so hot, I want to explode, I want to feel that hard, wonderful cock in me. I'm not sure I can wait to feel him. I need to taste him."</p> <p>I felt him slip out of my shorts and he lay me down on the sand. My knees came up over the edge of the dune. He quickly slid my wet panties to the side, but with one quick motion he plunged into me as far as he could and began pounding me against the bottom of the dune. I felt him throb between my legs and I felt a finger on each finger, then a thumb as he rubbed around my engorged clit. "Mmmm, I love that." Phil whispered, just before he came, "I love that." He did not say all that, but I felt him explode as I felt him shooting his warm juices inside me. I felt it running over my insides as he emptied himself into me. As we rested, he pulled himself out of me and stood up to get his pants back on. "I'll see you there at practice." he said as he began walking away.</p> <p>My eyes were riveted on the bulge in the front of his pants, which had once again developed in length until he looked back and smiled "If you are ever going to find the one and only man in this world, you can get yourself here, now." He said as he walked away. "I'm going back to my cabin now. I will call you in a few weeks, I just want to see how it goes" as he left. His hips were swaying as he was walking away and I was sure that any woman would look his ass. I wanted his butt. I could see all the shape a pussy and that little movement.</p> <p></p> <p>Phil returned to my mind and my naked eyes were back to my mind with Phil, all—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
