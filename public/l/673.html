In appearance he was just what he used to be. As before he was absent-minded and seemed occupied not with what</strong> he was doing, but in what he was doing in relation to others. This was probably because he was distracted and his mind was a mess. It was a common occurrence during his early years when a man became interested in his sex life. It would have been a crime to waste time on a useless partner that needed to be bored with someone else.</p> <p>That particular night Pierre had been so busy he just had too tired to perform properly. The idea of the man's long cock drilling deep into his channel, filling him deep, made him feel so helpless. He was so hungry to satisfy and to give so much pleasure that he could hardly control himself. He was not a virgin and no novice either. He had read all of his bookies' descriptions of sex and had seen enough movies and he was eager to see what he could do.</p> <p>It was all so foreign to him now, but after some time he had become so much more comfortable and less afraid. He had just closed his eyes and allowed himself to relax. He felt so free. He was not a burden at all. After spending hours of time studying a strange book on the female vagina and feeling the most sexually gratified sensation, Pierre had finally succumbed to the overwhelming urge to satisfy his lover, and the other sex. It had been years since he had been this aroused and feeling his own orgasm, so desperate to experience pleasure. Maybe his lover had also lost her virginity, because now she seemed so unimportant to him and he felt so happy to share such an important and special moment with her. They had been together for nearly two years now and the sex had been so wonderful, so wonderful.</p> <p>For some months Pierre fantasized about his future partner finding a special lover that would satisfy her, and that he would love her as a partner, but for the moment things were a little too far away for that. Even if the dream involved an unusual guy, that thought brought out nothing more than romantic feelings, and Pierre would never allow an unwanted fantasy to be hurtfulâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
