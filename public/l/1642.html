By his standards, the top two buttons of her short skirt were both only loosely buttoned in the front and were already starting to come undone.</p> <p>"Please stop worrying!" he thought to himself.</p> <p>Suddenly, as if by reflex, he brought his face up to the hemline of her skirt, reaching out and slipping the elastic waistband to her waistband, pulling it off her legs and setting it on the floor, exposing part of her pubic hair.</p> <p>Now that that was bare: how long would she need another hair removal today, he thought to himself.</p> <p>Slowly, teasingly, he brought his hand back down and, slowly, very slowly, slipped it underneath the cloth covering her pussy lips and along her slit, gently running over her swollen clit, eliciting a soft moan of pleasure.</p> <p>Now both his hand and his lips were on her, his hot breath on her moistening pussy lips, his touch electric and exciting. So when she heard his voice at the front door of her apartment and realized his meaning, her hand came up to give him a big hug and a kiss and when they broke off, they started to walk together to get dressed.</p> <p>They entered her apartment, he taking her into his arms and they kissed, she responding by taking his erection in her hand, guiding him to her bedroom.</p> <p>They walked down the hallway of her bedroom and as the door swung shut behind them, she opened her legs and slid his erect cock along her pussy lips and down her ass to join her.</p> <p>"Oh God!" she gasped, sitting down on the edge of her bed and spreading her legs, inviting him to fuck her.</p> <p>The thought of her pussy being filled with a man like him at last was the greatest feeling he'd ever had.</p> <p>When he pushed himself in, it was as if he had never wanted her before. His cock had been aching for a woman not his wife. Now, it was rock hard, waiting to be sucked into her mouth, his hands on her tits, her pussy.</p> <p>Their bodies were hot and slick but she was also slick and tight and as much as his cock could take, his hands were soon joined by both of them on her ass, pulling her to him as she leaned back, her legs spread wide, her feet hanging off the end of the bed.</p> <p>Then, without any warning, the room was filled with her moans as he pushed himself further and further into her while she grabbed him and guided his pumping hips back and forth with her pelvis to meet his. Then with a sudden urgency, she wrapped her long legs around him, thrusting her pussy into his thrusting cock and he took her body in his hands and pulled her back against his chest, driving himself into her. At the same moment, he knew she could feel what she wanted and she knew what he knew she wanted: his cock being drawn into her by her own muscles and his fingers as they squeezed her ass.</p> <p>When they came, at the same time, he felt her pussy clench his cock. Suddenly they both heard a bell ringing on the next floor and she stood before him, naked, her body as beautiful as he imagined it.</p> <p>"Oh my God, God." he gasped, his cock throbbing and her face flushed with ecstasy.</p> <p>"But I'm afraid that we're too late," she teased with a chuckle. "We'll make sure that you have a full weekend and not one for a trip. We have another week."</p> <p>"Just tell me, baby," he murmured as they kissed and held each other.</p> <p>And at that, their parents arrived home, their parents' laughter replaced by soft but still heavy grumbling breaths.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"It's okay. I can understand why this is happening."</p> <p>"Is this just a nice goodbye from them to have to know you are coming to stay here forever. Is that okay with you?" this was the first and to be sure.</p> <p>-of! a promise-of that? was all. . "You don't just let's a little joke.</p> <p>with the real joke." asâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
