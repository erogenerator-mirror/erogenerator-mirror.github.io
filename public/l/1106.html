Six o’clock was striking from Saint-Médard. Jondrette marked off each stroke with a toss of his head. When</strong> he had finished he opened the envelope. What the fuck am I going to do with this? He thought to himself. He knew it would make him look even more desirable in more intimate fashion than usual. He opened the last page and read over the title. It described how much he enjoyed anal sex. And it described what good he felt and what would come later.</p> <p>The thought of him having anal sex made him hard. He felt his cock swell even more. He looked down at his exposed cock. It was pulsing with blood. The pre-cum had oozed out of it and formed an opaque glistening white circle. His stomach had grown warm. Suddenly, his own cock hardened as he imagined what he would feel as he was being penetrated by a thick, fat cock. He looked down and saw his own cock was straining to be set free. He quickly closed the paper before realizing how much fun it would be to hold it.</p> <p>It should be fun to let go right now. He thought. I’m gonna jack off before we get to the fuck.</p> <p>He thought of being in the shower with the other kids and of him having a threesome with them. He thought of doing all these nasty and nasty things with girls while he was jacking off. It was just that simple – no more of that. He thought of what it would be like to feel like one of those girls and she was his. He thought of her licking his cock and he thought of a girl licking his balls.</p> <p>He remembered the first time he licked a girl’s cunt when she had taken him into her mouth and let him fuck her like an animal. What a fucking slut. He remembered the girl sucking his cock as he shot his cum into her mouth. His cock jerked furiously in his hand as he imagined what if would have been. He imagined himself standing there with his cock sticking out and his mind on her luscious breasts covered in his cum. He imagined her naked breasts looking up at his cock.</p> <p>He imagined her mouth opening as she sucked him. His cock began to spasm. He felt a strange surge in his prick as he ejaculated.</p> <p>His cum shot out of his cock in several long streams and landed on his chest. As the semen flowed down his body, more began to seep through his fingers. The hand holding his still-hard cock and the fingers he brought toward his mouth. He opened his lips, sucked on his fingers and looked up at the ceiling. For the first time he heard the sound of a cell-phone.</p> <p>“Hello?” he said, in a low voice.</p> <p>“Jules?” the soft, husky female voice on the phone.</p> <p>“Yes sweetheart. That’s me. How’s my evening?”</p> <p>“It’s been fantastic. I’m on my way home. I was beginning to think I might have made up my mind.”</p> <p>“We’ll talk about it later,” the female voice said.</p> <p>As if remembering the phone call in his hand, Jack opened the laptop and found it to be empty. So, he decided, they can’t come to me’s apartment in the middle of evening if they don’d already do this. After an hour and a half of driving, he had to admit he’d fallen asleep. He woke up around three in the morning, which was just as well since he had a few good-morning meetings scheduled. Not exactly the good-morning ritual. Not exactly when he would have to get up, shower and run into town, but his mind kept wandering to his wife, who would be there as well. Maybe she would be asleep, but what?</p> <p>He got up to get a cup of coffee. She was standing just outside the apartment door. It was dark and had been completely dark for almost an hour. He stepped out of his pants and threw them on the chair. As he sat on the couch, he opened his briefcase. He opened each item of clothing and drew out the items he usually kept in the briefcase. He wanted to look at his wife as much as he looked at his wife’s.</p> <p>He picked up the briefcase and threw it on the floor between them. As he started to place the items on the floor, a sound suddenly caught his ear. It sounded faintly like the shower, if there was a shower at all. He knew it couldn’t be a woman’s shower. He turned the noise closer and could faintly heard the sound of a female body in him. He imagined running. The image felt his cock growing stiffen of the image in his mind.
