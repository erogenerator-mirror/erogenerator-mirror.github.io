The house and the garden, with all the objects surrounding them, were now become familiar, and the ordinary</strong> routine was no longer an issue.</p> <p>The children's conversation was lively and energetic. There was an immediate revival to the atmosphere around them.</p> <p>"This sounds like fun," said Jennifer, "I'm not surprised it went down much better than with the other houses. The house and garden have been used more in the area than ever before. I guess you think that's what it will look like to make love to your sister?"</p> <p>"She's really something. She still has some ideas about this house and garden, but she hasn't really made any suggestions I can see. Maybe she doesn't even know how to build it."</p> <p>The conversation continued at that point with various other topics being dealt with. Soon, the subject turned to sex and family.</p> <p>"You should give her some real cock," said Susan.</p> <p>"Oh yeah," said Jenny. "We haven't even been fucking yet. He's too busy to get me off with his fingers."</p> <p>"You're right," said Susan. "I should have fucked more of him before I met you and Jennifer."</p> <p>"Oh yeah," said Jennifer. "He's really getting into it. It's not like I wouldn't jump him right then."</p> <p>"Yeah okay," said Susan. "There is something about being caught by your husband that has made me hot already. He has a nice dick and so do I. If he gets me nice and wet, I'll bet he fucks me whenever he can get me."</p> <p>"I haven't had much luck either," said Susan. "I guess this has to do with their upbringing, if sex is supposed to be about enjoying the moment. I'm not sure I've ever been with a real life guy."</p> <p>"What is your sex life anyway," said Jennifer.</p> <p>"Yeah, I have one, but you're the first one I've had."</p> <p>"You guys were the easiest to start with," said Susan. "I should have told you how great you both are. I think you both get along very well."</p> <p>"So I can't go back to where we are now?" Jennifer asked.</p> <p>"I certainly can't. The things we've discovered together are amazing and you've all really opened my eyes. We just have to wait for the right time."</p> <p>Chapter Eighteen</p> <p>Jennifer went off to her bedroom and sat down, naked, next to the computer on the desk. She pulled her knees up on the desk and closed her eyes. She couldn't believe how intense that experience had been. How many times had she tried to be discreet with her body while it was sexually active? This kind of stimulation was something she had never really considered, or at least not fully thought of as a thing she ever would do. She wanted to feel what it was like to come off sex as being a woman having sex with a man, as a man having sex with a woman. It wasn't anything she could ever be proud to be proud of, but still...</p> <p>She wanted to feel sex. She wanted to be fucked; she wanted to feel the touch of another woman's hand or tongue upon her skin. She wanted to be able to experience sexual pleasure without feeling guilty or ashamed. She needed to experience it to the fullest. She had no doubt that she had found the perfect girl. She couldn't resist, but she had to make it to the right place.</p> <p>She decided to get the most out of it. She turned off the monitor and closed her eyes, savoring her daydream with eyes closed.</p> <p>She didn't hear Susan return. She was in bed, with her legs curled up on her bed. For a second she thought about going outside, but quickly discarded that idea. Instead, she turned on the computer and started to type. After a short, but intense, daydream, she had been a bit more awake, and the screen filled with the image of her face, with her eyes closed and her mouth stretched for her imaginary man.</p> <p>The thought of that image brought on an unexpected erection, and Jennifer gasped, a loud sound that was both startled and excited. She felt herself blush.</p> <p>She was sure that if she opened her legs, it would flash to her man lying on his side with his cock in her hand. Jennifer had never heard such sounds, or felt such emotion. It wasn't just the arousal, of course. That was one of the things she had always been proud of about herself and her husband. In fact, she liked the feeling of being touched by another. She wondered if that might have a bearing on the sensations she felt.</p> <p>But it wasn't the image of herself that bothered her. They were her husband's penis, of course. It was something else. It was not just the idea that they were making her feel the sensation of it. She was making her vagina, notâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
