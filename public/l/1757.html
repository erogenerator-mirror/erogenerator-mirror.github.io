MORE ABOUT CLAUDE FROLLO.</h4><p><strong>In 1482, Quasimodo was about twenty years of age; Claude Frollo, about thirty-six. One had grown up, the other had grown old. Claude Frollo was no longer the simple scholar</strong>.</p> <p>They were the perfect children, for as long as they were alive, they would be married to their chosen Master.</p> <p>As soon as he was out of her reach, she felt herself being pulled into his embrace, her tongue lapping at his throat and her bare pussy, which was now oozing its juices down to meet the warm, inviting skin of his belly. She was glad that it was nighttime. She knew that he would make love to her soon. She had come close a time or two, but now that had been a few days ago.</p> <p>Claude Frollo's hands were all over hers, guiding her to her knees so that she could suck her way up his stomach. And now she was looking up into his eyes, eyes that pleaded with her to give him a blow job. She wanted to taste his juices, to feel the thick warmth of his flesh on hers. She wanted to love him. Only then would she be able to take him into her mouth, to swallow all of his hot cream.</p> <p>His words had been like magic and she had never heard him say the language that he had spoken. He smiled down at her, as he said that only when she was prepared to go further. He pulled her head close to him, running his fingers through her hair and over her face and lips. She felt his erection press into her lower stomach, to the left thigh, which was on his right side. His arm had encased her around the waist and now his fingers traced over the outline of her pussy lips, brushing against the tiny pearl of her clit. Her knees went weak as he began to circle her clit while she bobbed her head up and down. Her face, so familiar and so young, turned purple as he stroked her clit into a soft, shuddering point. She felt her own orgasm beginning to build, to burst over her.</p> <p>"Do it," she heard him say, "do it for me."</p> <p>"Yes," she answered, "please do it. Your pleasure is your pleasure, my pleasure."</p> <p>As her body responded to his words, so his, his finger found its way to her clit. Her body shuddered as lightning bolts tore through her veins. Her hands found her breasts, pulling and caressing them. She could tell by the look on his face that he was enjoying her torment at the hands of her Master. She lifted her head and looked right into his eyes, pleading silently, eyes pleading with him to give her pleasure. Her tongue snaked out at first and then licked along the tip of his dick.</p> <p>"Yes," he said, "your clit will always be my pleasure."</p> <p>"Now," she croaked, thinking that she had given him exactly what he wanted. Her tongue took him in her lips as his hand pulled on her hair, his other hand reaching down her body and holding her pussy, his fingers curling around her clit. He was teasing her with his fingers as she moaned around his cock, her tongue sliding back and forth across the tip, around the root. She wanted to taste him, to feel him in her mouth. But the feelings coming from her clit were too powerful, too powerful to be allowed to happen. She felt herself falling over the edge, over the cliff that started to crest from the pit of her stomach down to the soft, wet walls between her legs. She felt her climax come on. She was losing control as her body shook and trembled, and she was so close. She felt his mouth cover the tip of his dick as he started to pump her mouth. His hands were on her head, guiding her in time with his thrusts, his rhythm so perfect. His hips moved into her, forward and backward as he pushed himself fully against her lips. At the top of each stroke she was forced to suck on him, or at the bottom all his sperm would be forced into her. She felt him grow, sensed his explosion coming closer, his hot sperm shooting from him into her mouth. The sensation was incredible as her senses were overwhelmed. She came as he did, with a moan that was barely audible. "Oh, my God," she thought as his sperm filled her mouth, and as she felt the warmth of his cum hit her tongue.</p> <p>As she took his cock out of her mouth, her hand was stroking at the base and up and down. Each touch sending waves of pleasure through her like electric jolts. He sawed away as she masturbated, her other hand fondling his balls. Her tongue wrapped around as it tickled every nerve, causing him to shake inside. His hand left her hair and reached up into her face, finding her mouth. He kissed her, his tongue plunging into her mouth as his own, as his hands stroking out. At the passion filled hers with his seed. Her mouth was all through his, all that they couldâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
