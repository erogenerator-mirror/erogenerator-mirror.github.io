It is not possible that any nature should be inferior unto art,</h4><p><strong>since that all arts imitate nature. If this be so; that the most perfect and general nature of all natures should in her operation come short of the skill of</strong> sex, the more the sex, the better. So she had to create a sex-in-the-world scenario. Which was easy if you wanted to have a chance to feel in the moment and in the moment there was not a doubt about that. And I would have been the luckiest man in a hundred summers to have a chance to fuck that perfect ass of hers but I had made my choice too.</p> <p>Sitting on the floor between her asscheeks was a gorgeous girl as beautiful as the one I was sitting under. I could make out her face and the lines around her eyes. And from the way her legs moved in response to my fingers sliding up and down her thighs, she was wearing panties too. I could tell by her body that she was completely bare.</p> <p>I looked at her face with an intent stare. I would not just fuck it; I could kiss it. Kiss it as if it was her. Kiss like it belonged to my lips. Then I started slowly fucking her.</p> <p>After watching how I was fucking her, her moaning, and the fact that it was my hand over her panties that had the effect of pulling on her hips had me wondering the same as she was wondering my cock would. So I pulled in and out so slowly and carefully. I had to try to keep the tempo up. I could barely take my eyes off of her and the way the muscles all moved, she was just perfect to be fucked by my cock. I didn't want to hurt her. Maybe I could just take away her beauty, my beauty, and put my lust in a different place.</p> <p>But I did keep a couple minutes going. And in my opinion the fact that this pretty young girl was still standing there watching me with her face so close to mine had me wondering what she thought of her watching me.</p> <p>A while later, when she stood up, and looked at me with the same sort of stare that I gave to her, she suddenly reached down to grab her panties and pull them to the side and let my cock slide just half-way inside of her.</p> <p>The sight that caught my attention was the way her pussy opened right up and swallowed my cock. There was no mistaking that I could feel her pussy muscles pulling at me as she closed them tightly around me. As I was inside of her, almost fully inside, I saw the head of my cock just touching up to her cervix. I could feel the muscles of her pussy sucking and pressing on me as she held her panties to the side. And, of course, when she opened her mouth and pulled her lips back just a bit and looked at me in my eyes as if I were really saying "Hey" to her, I felt the muscles of her pussy squeezing me. But when she came back in a big wave of heat and wetness, I felt the muscle inside the walls of her pussy relax, clamp down tight around me, and let itself go.</p> <p>She looked over at me as if I was really asking her to join us in making love to me and I couldn't speak. I saw the way her body jiggled as she stood there, but the way she stood up and leaned over and kissed me and I wanted to feel what it was like. I want to feel as if my cock was actually inside of her.</p> <p>To be honest, I was afraid of what might happen if we touched each other if I did start to slide out of her. And I wondered what she would think. What thoughts would she have if her pussy got too tight around me anymore? So I wanted me to stay in her because I did not want to feel that tight pussy squeezing me.</p> <p>The whole time I was watching her, watching her while I watched her, I had never had any thoughts of sex with a girl as beautiful. But I wanted to feel as much as I wanted to be felt.</p> <p>So I started to slide in and out of her. First slow, slow, slow, slow. Then I went faster.</p> <p>In a moment my hands were still on her hips and I was taking slow, deep thrusts in and out. But I went deeper than ever before, pulling away so just the head of my cock would remain inside of her. I tried to do this to her but she wouldn't let me. I tried to take her deeper still, and she just laughed at my clumsy effort but she understood my error and pulled her pelvis away just as I pushed my cock deep in her.</p> <p>We began working our way back to the top of her body after she started to make loud, uncontrolled noises. I'm not used to talking dirty but I didn't care. It was music to my ears. And I felt her body shaking and her pussy quivering around the head of my cock and then she stopped.</p> <p></p> <p>In the meantime I tried to go deeper still for deeper I tried to go deeper now.
