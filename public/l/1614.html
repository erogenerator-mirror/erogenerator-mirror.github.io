The visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day; and all that she might be supposed to have</strong> forgotten were the memories, the pleasant memories. A day at Coles could get to me; but how the hell did I get home so early?</p> <p>The next day she took a leisurely shower. I watched a movie; I took a shower. I got dressed; I just sat in a chair and read a paper so it would appear that I was asleep.</p> <p>I don't really remember much when in the tub; all I remember is my eyes opening. I didn't see Emma naked; but I sure did hear her shower start. That's when I remembered my dream.</p> <p>The water was flowing over me; I reached behind me and untied my shirt. That's when I got the most intense fantasy of my life. I watched Emma take off her bathrobe and reveal her body. It was a magnificent sight with her legs dangling above the water. I had a clear view of her pussy as it slithered down, and I wanted it again. I reached between my legs so that I could guide my cock into Emma. She didn't say anything; she didn't resist; she just leaned back and relaxed.</p> <p>Soon she was taking it in all the way; and then back out. The water was running down her body; her tits were hanging above the water. She leaned back and started stroking while I fucked her. She was in her glory. I thought about what she said the other night, or that she said her father fucked her. I could cum; but only if it meant I could touch her, or maybe touch hers; but not her.</p> <p>I couldn't stop thinking about Emma's naked body. I knew that she had the best figure I could imagine; and if you believe your brain can tell that you are masturbating again, you need to think about her. If you look away from that window it can be pretty clear as if it were one of those old windows on the roof.</p> <p>As she was stroking and jacking on her own body, I was stroking and feeling my dick. I wanted to watch her. I felt good. I wanted to see it. I felt like she could see me. I didn't want her to. I felt a little guilty. Of course I wanted to see her; and I wanted to fuck her.</p> <p>I took a risk and stroked a little faster. I wanted to fuck her so badly. I wanted to eat it dry. I started to fuck the cum out of Emma. Then she started to get into it. She started to really moan; she wasn't talking words; but she still had the sound of a good little whore.</p> <p>I was right behind her. I had to stop before I shot my load; but I couldn't do it again. I wanted to do it again. The reality of that thought was just too good, too real.</p> <p>After I shot my final shot of cum the water had cooled and Emma was out of the tub. I knew that I would want to wake her again.</p> <p>I got dressed. I put on my underwear; I was ready. I went up to the front door, put my keys in my pocket, and said goodbye to Emma. It was the best goodbye ever.</p> <p>I wanted nothing else than to spend more and more time with her. It was a special day; I knew it at the time. But today I wanted to enjoy the day too.</p> <p>I got out of my car and walked over to Emma's house. I pulled over in front of her house.</p> <p>That's when I was struck with how nice she looked.</p> <p>The light was in the entryway. She smiled and said: "You can come in now, you know."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>She opened the door, then pushed me inside. She led me by the hand, which was still wrapped around my dick. I followed her through the house. She led me to a bedroom where she let me get on the bed. I got on all fours.</p> <p>I was so horny; but I didn't care. I wanted to fuck her. And I couldn't. I wasn't going to be able to think about it once she was naked, or bent over a bed.</p> <p>I felt her hands grasp my ass checks and spread them. I felt her wet tongue as it ran over my dick, then her hand.</p> <p>My cock was so hard. I thought about it as she wrapped her hand around my hard cock and started stroking me. She took it in her hand and massaged my balls. I didn't want her to stop, I wanted her to do it longer, to keep going on longer.</p> <p></p> <p>she took me, then took me in; I moaned of her, and the way. I was not done I was her, took it all, I was me oh she took meâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
