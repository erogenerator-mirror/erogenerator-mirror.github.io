She was</strong> not the marrying type at all, and she certainly could not imagine how any man could stand in the way of her wedding. Her wedding night was already over, and the two had much to do in order to complete the ritual.</p> <p>Dana was to take her down to the airport, where she would take her daughter for the honeymoon and take her home, where she would continue as her own mother. As long as Dana stayed with Edna, their son would have a place at home. With Edna gone and it being a small wedding for their son, Dana felt that she should have been at her husband's side. Her husband was so well respected that no one really needed to worry about her having to leave him. Besides, Edna was her mother.</p> <p>Dana opened the door to her home and then followed Edna through the door and walked through the hall to the front door. She opened it and Edna had already put her dress on after taking off the wedding ring and dropping it by the back door.</p> <p>"Edna. It is nice to see you again."</p> <p>Edna shook her head. "I can't believe what I just did. I am so ashamed."</p> <p>"Edna, no you are not. I am no longer your parent's child, and I am no longer your wife. Besides," Edna reached out her hand and took Edna's hand in hers. "Edna, this place is all yours. Everything you will ever need is here. Do you feel at home there? I mean, there is a lot of bedrooms right at home."</p> <p>"I am here. I just took off the ring." Edna said, shrugging her shoulders.</p> <p>"Oh, no. Look Edna. You are still naked. I don't care. I had only intended it to be a nice night for you."</p> <p>Edna felt a blush rising to her face as she stood there and looked down. She started to turn red with embarrassment, and Dana noticed that Edna blushed herself. "No. I mean... I..." Edna took Dana's hand and then followed her over to the bedroom door.</p> <p>"Edna, when we are finished with this, I want you to take your clothes off. If I were you, I'll get the best part of this house," Edna said.</p> <p>Edna turned to look the way she saw it, to see her naked on the bed. "Take off your dress. Then..." Edna looked into Dana's eyes. "Will you be naked when we are done?"</p> <p>"Yes, please be naked," Dana answered, taking the robe from Edna's shoulders.</p> <p>Edna was relieved. She had to admit that she actually felt as naked as she suddenly felt. Edna could feel her own naked breasts pressed against Dana's naked body, her breasts against her daughter's naked body. Edna pulled back and quickly removed the robe.</p> <p>"Edna, I didn't know if it would be that easy, but I don't really want you to take off your panties, or even your bra. Do we have to start over?" Dana looked at the floor, a look of panic on her face. "Edna please. Please don't do this. Please don't do this."</p> <p>Edna couldn't help but smile, feeling a wave of relief run through her at Dana's words and not only her own nakedness. She felt free. She never wanted to see Dana naked. She just wanted Dana naked.</p> <p>The three women sat across from each other in the center of the bed, and the room smelled of sex and oil. Dana felt very much like she had just received a good fucking from Edna, while Edna felt very much like, "Oh, thank you," and "Thank you," and "I had to stop myself from cumming just then."</p> <p>Dana saw herself as Edna. She was more of a woman than she ever had been. Her body felt more womanly than she had felt before she had had sexual intercourse with Edna. She was not only naked, she was feeling more female than male. She looked about the room and saw not only the wedding dress and wedding ring on all three of the chairs, but also the bed with its mirrored legs.</p> <p>Edna had looked in the mirrors at the mirror, and she had noticed Edna's reflection. The reflection reflected her, but she also reflected Edna's own reflection as naked as she was. Edna looked at herself in the mirror and realized that she was feeling rather than saw the same sexual feeling she had just felt when she came. Edna looked at herself and found herself, very much alike, a lot of more woman than she had ever been sexually felt with, Dana. a penis or not only an penis.</p> <p></p> <p>as sexual attraction with a penis.</p> <p>penâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
