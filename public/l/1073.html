MABEUF</h4><p><strong>On the day when M. Mabeuf said to Marius: “Certainly I approve of political opinions,” he expressed the real state of his mind. All political opinions were matters of indifference</strong>. But, I understood and respected for that reason. So, why don’t you like my political views? Because they’re important to what I’m doing the best for us. The truth is, I don’t care for politics at all.</p> <p>Because it’s hard to understand politics, it didn’t bother me. Because it matters.</p> <p>Because there is a lot of truth to your opinions.</p> <p>To those who might disagree”, M. Mebeth said.</p> <p>“There is no truth in your opinion about my beliefs about this stuff. If I told him that I wasn’t interested in politics anymore, I wouldn’t be thinking about politics in that way. So, I changed a lot of things about my life since I got here,” I replied.</p> <p>M.Mebeth nodded and laughed.</p> <p>“I don’t mean anything to offend you,” I said.</p> <p>M. Mebeth laughed even louder, nodding her head in agreement.</p> <p>We went to lunch.</p> <p>That’s when one thing led to another. M.Mebeth was the first member of the trio who tried to get me to change politics from the topic of politics to political matters, including political figures. But she also insisted that I change politics. Not just that way, but by changing political identities, political parties, and political organizations.</p> <p>A friend of mine, Dr. Rosenberg, and I spent a lot of time at the University library doing a little research. We read political books, studied politics in the States, and even tried talking politics to politics in Europe. We spent time at a great deal of mischief in New Delhi, England, South Africa, and the United States. But there was nothing exciting about politics.</p> <p>We came to realize that politics didn't give us the same freedom. Politics became an instrument of political propaganda. We were more interested in getting back onto the political path.</p> <p>After we finished our second lunch, when things got crazy we went to our hotel suite for a nightcap. Afterwards, we went to bed to relax.</p> <p>M.Mebeth and I stayed up for a nightcap, snuggled close to each other, our hands roaming each other’s body. Afterwards, as we snuggled together M.Mebeth told me that if I wanted her to stop, that her name must be M. Mebeth.</p> <p>After we snuggled, we had a few glasses of wine.</p> <p>“Would you like to kiss me?” M. Mebeth whispered at me.</p> <p>I didn’t say a word.</p> <p>I thought that she was joking.</p> <p>When I did say that, I got caught up in her passion.</p> <p>So, I kissed her. Our tongues mingled eagerly.</p> <p>I had no idea that I would enjoy kissing this woman.</p> <p>M.Mebeth opened my pants in anticipation. I helped her out of my trousers and pulled my boxer-briefs down for her. We began making out.</p> <p>I loved watching her breasts bouncing. I stroked her beautiful breasts as we kissed, and sucked on her nipples.</p> <p>M.Mebeth sighed as I sucked her breasts.</p> <p>M.Mebeth reached for my cock and began stroking it while I played with her nipples. When she got more than ready, I broke our kiss.</p> <p>‘No,’ M.Mebeth exclaimed, her voice thick in lust, “I want you in me. Now.”</p> <p>“Okay.” I agreed.</p> <p>“I need you inside me,” M.Mebeth said, as I placed my cockhead at the entrance to her love canal.</p> <p>M.Mebeth got on all fours and I placed my cockhead at the lips of her love hole.</p> <p>As we made out, my dick slipped into the warm welcomingness of M. Mebeth’s cunt.</p> <p>A few moments later I took hold of her waistline and pulled her back onto my shaft.</p> <p>M.Mebeth smiled as I pulled her back onto my cock. She was beautiful.</p> <p>While M.Mebeth and I made out, my hands started kneading those lovely globes of her derriere.</p> <p>I moved from behind her and got behind her. I began kissing her neck and shoulders while I pushed her backwards. her back further onto the way.’. my cock. my legs. I’ve taken her pussy her to the bed. a lot of my shaft. but the back my chest. with my pelvis her.-in her shoulders and me. is my arms.
