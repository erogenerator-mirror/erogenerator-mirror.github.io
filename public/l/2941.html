If thy Brother offend thee, tell it him privately; then with Witnesses; lastly, tell the Church; and then if he obey not,</strong> give thas permission, and the Church will grant thy desires. For these are the most popular ideas that are available, all in the same sentence.</p> <p>Let the Church know that when asked about this, the only thing to write is "the Church." (Lyt. 11:19.)</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>Now I tell the story. I told my husband I was thinking about having sex all night. I got a little uncomfortable. He said he wanted me to go to bed. "You go to bed with me. We'll have lots of sex tomorrow." He gave me a big kiss. It started out well. He made love to me. It goes in a rhythm as we both climax. Then our bodies start to go limp. We both had a good climaxing moment. This is called "Orgasm 101." It is something we have talked about. I have had orgasms. But it wasn't my first one. It was more like a long time ago. The whole experience changed my attitude towards sex. I don't know why. It felt good. Sex with my husband is great. We also have a great sex life.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>So the good part of my sex story is already done. I have already started it and I am sure I won't forget it. First, I want to tell you about some of my past experiences.</p> <p>I was married to my husband. Our sex life went from fucking to him having a hard cock inside me. This was our fourth anniversary. We had no children. We both were very busy with our careers and other things. I was thirty-five, about a year younger than him. He was twenty-two.</p> <p>We both worked for our own companies. We were married in less than four months. We had no children. We were also married in our 40s. I had been faithful to my husband till I was forty. I enjoyed sex with my husband and a second wife when they were around. This time I was not happy with it. I wanted to keep it as a secret, and not have sex with them again. We had never fucked again. It was our wedding night. There was the wedding day. I woke up in the morning naked in bed with my arms around my best friend, our two biggest friends, Paul and Susan.</p> <p>Paul was eighteen, a senior in my class. I was 24 and Paul was his best friend. We didn't really talk, but we were very close and loved each other. We both were in relationships to other couples. Our sex life was very active. We both enjoyed each other and loved each other.</p> <p>Susan was nineteen. She was married to my second wife, Paul. Paul was ten years older. I was nineteen. We had been married for several years. Our sex life was good. I was really good. I guess the whole sex and love was good too.</p> <p>We enjoyed sex. We all enjoyed our sex and loved sex together. We always had sex. We used condoms, often, I never was a littler on the use of a condom. We started fucking on the regular.</p> <p>Paul and I were just friends with two friends from work. They were not that close to us. There is no sex we wouldn't have made love to our friend's spouse during sex. It is all about our pleasure. Susan was my best friend and my second in marriage.</p> <p>Paul's husband was twenty-one. We knew each other through school. Susan never told us that our "friend" wasn't a man.</p> <p>Paul and I liked each other. We knew it was a lot. We talked frequently. We had sex with each other. We often shared. We had sex together again, and again. I got off in the night. Our friend Paul got off in my bathroom, and I got off in the morning.</p> <p>We enjoyed sex together. More and more with each passing month. Paul and I used condoms frequently. Sometimes we would just fuck. If sex was the right thing, we used condoms regularly. Some times I didn't want to go bareback with Paul during sex. Paul didn't. We also had a quickie with Paul on his back with me on top, and Paul eating my pussy.</p> <p>We used the computer more often than our friendship. We did lots of things together. We still liked each other. We only had sex from time to time.</p> <p>Paul was the only friend we had any longer. It gave us more time to make love to our friend's wife. Paul and I would make love very often, but also have sex with someone else. Paul could still get me off every time he visited me and he fucked me. I did. I had a lot of sexual experience with Paul but Paul, other than him.</p> <p>We talked when we still liked having sex with each other people. I was different and were differentâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
