It was the first time a woman ever touched another male, if that was even an acceptable description. It looked like fun. I'd never touched another male before. I looked at the clock. 11:30.</p> <p>I guess I'm not in a hurry. What would we do? Would I have to masturbate to sleep? I'd only ever seen penises. I'd even been inside one when I was younger and was too frightened. No, I'd have to be in some of the most erotic situations to experience real-life sex. I'm still a virgin. I'll have to learn how to get off without trying.</p> <p>A hand was stroking my arm. It was warm, and soft. A soft, sensual caress. I moved toward it and felt the warmth of the hand on my breast. The hand was caressing my nipple. I opened my thighs a bit, so that a hand could slide inside my panties, the other hand caressing my pussy and clit.</p> <p>'How long have you fantasized about seeing a man having sex with a woman,' a soft voice said.</p> <p>'Only you,' I replied.</p> <p>I felt one of the fingers start to slide against my pussy lips. It felt warm, like I had just woken up. It felt kind of naughty, too, and I didn't want it to stop. I tried to imagine being in bed with Mr. Peters, with Professor, maybe. It probably wouldn't work out. Then, of course, I heard a voice.</p> <p>'You want to do this with me,' it said.</p> <p>I'm sure some of my first thoughts were wondering what this strange voice was telling me to do. 'How would you like me?' I said.</p> <p>'Get on your back, girl. I want to see your wet hole spread open for your first man.'</p> <p>'It's so sexy.' I said. It was, actually, really erotic. I felt like I could talk with Mr. Peters again. It felt so soft and warm.</p> <p>'I'm going to get you naked,' said the voice, 'and then maybe I'll put my cock inside you. You want that?'</p> <p>'You mean to get naked with me!' I said, sounding surprised with myself, or maybe the thought. If it were true, it's what I told myself not long ago when all my fantasies were on one mind.</p> <p>'I will, and I'm glad you want to be naked for me,' said the voice, 'because I'm going to get me all wet by imagining you taking off your shirt and putting it on me when you get dressed and come.'</p> <p>'Don't be silly,' I said.</p> <p>'I'm not kidding. Get out. The way, I'm going to masturbate with her.'</p> <p>It was really exciting to know that I was doing something more erotic than what I'd planned. But I wanted more than that. I wanted to feel a man's skin touching me, caressing me. I wanted to touch every part of the body of another man, even if there were two or two sexes involved. And maybe I should have felt more like a sister to my male professor. How would I ever be able to go back to class from now? The fact that I wanted to do this with another guy really surprised me. I was just as horny as I was afraid to be. When I was thinking about it, all my thoughts and feelings seemed to come back to me. I was so conflicted.</p> <p>I put my hand on my chest. I felt my nipples hardening, pressing against the lace of my bra. 'I want to feel his cock inside me,' I said.</p> <p>'You want him to be inside you,' said the voice, again.</p> <p>'I don't,' I admitted. I started to pull down my panties, a little embarrassed that a man and a woman had been in the same bed in our own bed. 'Oh, my breasts he's not in me.'</p> <p></p> <p>'It felt as good as great, now I could see he was I pulled my panties. Yes he wanted to feel more—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
