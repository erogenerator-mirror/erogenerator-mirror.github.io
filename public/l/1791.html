THE RETREAT IN WHICH MONSIEUR LOUIS OF FRANCE SAYS HIS PRAYERS.</h4><p><strong>The reader has not, perhaps, forgotten that one moment before catching sight of the nocturnal band of vagabonds, Quasimodo, as he inspected Paris from the heights of his bell tower,</strong> and after many more minutes of him entering the fray, the time was right. He lifted the manacle and placed it over one of the women's feet. A woman, like myself, was not particularly well endowed, but she was worth fucking when it was the right thing to do with a man's legs in her.</p> <p>The man grabbed my wife, and guided her to the bed. She was already naked, and he guided her to lie back, and began fucking her with an abandon borne of a woman who was about to get a pounding in her cunt and a fucking that was destined to be a bit brutal. She moaned and cried and began to buck and her body shook as it fought for control over the first orgasm of it's life that it had been waiting so long for.</p> <p>"God, you're good," the man cried out to me. "You've got a great set." He bent his neck to kiss her, and she responded by wrapping her arms and legs around him, trying to draw him into her as best as she could. "So good," he said.</p> <p>"You're so very good," she said with a sigh. "How can you keep from going crazy when you've got two little whores in all my holes."</p> <p>I stood beside the bed as he lay, his body limp, as he fucked my wife, then he said, "There's more we could do. We'll see."</p> <p>He pulled my wife off the bed and put her on the side of a chair. "I've got a vibrator. It'll help you cum. This would be a good one for your sweetie." He lay beside my wife and worked a vibrator into her pussy. "I'd love to have a dozen of them. I've been dreaming for a long time of being with you, and here you are. So beautiful."</p> <p>He got up from the bed to remove his own device. "Oh, God, you're sexy!"</p> <p>She moaned when he began fucking her with the vibrator, and even louder when he switched it on.</p> <p>"It's wonderful," he said as he pushed a third finger into her cunt. "I'm gonna enjoy using this."</p> <p>The vibrator entered her cunt and began fucking her again.</p> <p>"This is my favorite. If you two don't mind one more second—"</p> <p>He stopped me from asking her another way.</p> <p>"Be my guest."</p> <p>Once again, I was standing, my prick at attention waiting for some sign of what I wanted.</p> <p>She rolled on the chair back, and I moved between her legs, my prick rubbing against her outer lips. My wife's body was all I could feel. She was writhing and pushing herself against me as I reached around and began fingering her cunt in her little pussy while I continued pumping her pussy with the vibrator.</p> <p>"God, I don't know—how—how—I've wanted to do that to you for so long," she said. "It's been—I mean—about a long time."</p> <p>Quasimodo was working the little prick in and out of my wife now, the tiny organ stroking her G-spot while the vibrator pounded her cunt.</p> <p>"Mmmm," she moaned.</p> <p>I looked down into my wife's eyes and she was watching as much as I was. Her gaze was still focused on my prick as Quasimodo began fucking her with the penis. My wife's eyes were open and focused on mine as I continued doing wonderful things to her.</p> <p>"You know, I should—," she began, and the words trailed off as he moved away. She looked up, her expression questioning. I reached for a condom and placed it on my prick as it continued to pump while Quasimodo continued to fuck her.</p> <p>The look of confusion and fear I saw in her eyes again. Not from Quasimo, though, but from someone who'd taken him into their own little world of sexuality, as her eyes had told me.</p> <p>I had to go.</p> <p>"No!" they both said together.</p> <p>"No!" I said as I pushed Quasimodo's shoulders back and began to fuck my wife with even more power than I ever had before. Her face reflected her confusion.</p> <p>"No!" Quasimodo cried out, lifting his head and watching me, and then turning to me at the same time. He took my hand. "Come on," he said. "Let me fuck you."</p> <p>He helped me to my feet and we walked into the bedroom together.</p> <p>"What're you going to fuck?" he said, she said. "I'm just come now."</p> <p></p> <p>"You sure about doing, I'll wait about it</p> <p></p> <p>I'll suck you to fuck me you all will—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
