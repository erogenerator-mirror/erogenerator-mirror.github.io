All that</strong> time before a real world was over.</p> <p>There I was in the midst of an alluring fantasy about three girls, all so pretty and as fresh-faced as if they were wearing aprons, all in pink. A couple of her classmates were looking at them in confusion. The two of them, though, were also dressed in pink too, with their tight-fitting pink mini-skirt and revealing tank tops, but still. It was a real tease. I smiled, watching her bare legs move under her tight skirt and her tight tank top, her long, slender brown hair framing her face. She looked so adorable, like a princess or princess from a movie.</p> <p>In the middle of making her eyes dance wildly, she glanced at her friends and then back at them. There was something about her eyes that just seemed to sparkle. She looked like she'd be really, really happy to spend the day with someone as happy as her.</p> <p>There was definitely something about her that appealed to me.</p> <p>As beautiful as she was, but not just any pretty girl, this was a pretty girl, who definitely had to be on a pedestal. To just wear a skimpy white shirt and a pair of pink bra cups that barely covered or barely covered her breasts was a fantasy in which I'm sure, in my biased opinion, would never be fulfilled. Only, to be able to tell by looking at her with a smile and knowing that I'm probably going to want to be her boyfriend soon, as many a young man as I do, is as attractive as being naked if not with the best girlfriends I think I've ever had, and certainly as attractive as a beautiful girl.</p> <p>I looked at her, hoping for the one moment in which she'd forget that I was actually her boyfriend. Yet, even in those brief moments with her, I don't recall having a single one of my girlfriends even seeing me completely naked. If nothing else, being just an average guy who works out religiously and that doesn't have anything to do with the female body or being so young and so beautiful, I could do with an average guy not a nerd, but a sexy male, a sexier man perhaps, and I could take care of that.</p> <p>Yet, I also couldn't imagine ever seeing any of the other boys in the class who had the same fantasies I did, just with her wearing a skimpy shirt and a pair of pink bra cups. I could never have imagined wearing something that made her look even more beautiful without being seen as sexy, much as I still am.</p> <p>After looking at her, I looked for someone else to notice. I didn't want to seem like a tease, but I really did like her. I was really looking for a distraction, a girl that is a hot one, a sexy one. Who'd want to know that everyone in English Class who's been studying English for four years is looking at her on a pedestal?</p> <p>I stared at her for several moments, imagining that she was my girlfriend. I wanted to see her beautiful face, the sweet smile of her lips, but her beautiful, sultry voice, and the fact that she'd given me that stare that I looked so, so intently at to be the best girlfriends I could have ever been.</p> <p>I had to wonder how many of the guys with that fantasy could see how attractive I was. I had to wonder if she'd make it on to one of our classes. I wondered if her sweet smile might turn into a seductively wicked grin or a suggestive wink. I wondered how many other guys might be so enthralled by her looks, their lust for her, and the promise of her gorgeous body that they might even be lucky enough to have their way with her. I wondered if she'd make it into one of our classes, a class so filled with sexual experimentation and with so many guys willing to give their all over their teacher, an instructor who was the only one with the ability to be sexy and to be a total slut, the only teacher that I know would want to be like that.</p> <p>As horny as I was, I hadn't cum at school in over a week and I didn't even mind it. I mean, who am I supposed to be when I'm not supposed to cum so many times at the same time that I don't do. My friends were really cute, most of them but with no real talent on the sports field, even the pretty ones. Besides, the girl who was probably going to my high school with the best grades of all the other girls in my class probably wouldn't have any trouble finding a way to even to cum at school, with an orgasm, if she needed to find out an excellent English, so I think that she was just in it to be okay.</p> <p></p> <p>My dream. I said it out for the best I was my dream I was mine, when I, the dream with the—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
