Baskerville Hall</h4><p><strong>Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were ready upon the appointed day, and we started as arranged for Devonshire. Mr. Sherlock Holmes drove with me to the station and gave</strong> me directions. I was in the back seat with the captain's son and the rest of his family. We had a great family dinner, we had a nice evening at Sir Henry's home, and then our dinner. He helped me carry everything inside, so I was very comfortable and cared for by him. The night he was gone I was nervous all over again. I went to bed that night and just stayed in my own bed. The night after the night in the pub with the doctor, Mr. Holmes, he'd driven me home so he wouldn't see me in all my silly nightwear. We had dinner that night and watched some television. Then we watched a movie and we watched some porn. We made love that night.</p> <p>The next morning I awoke to the smell of coffee, Mr. Holmes' cock still buried in my mouth. I took his cock out of my mouth, "Mr. Holmes? Are you in the bathroom?"</p> <p>"Yes dear." He leaned back in the chair.</p> <p>I straddled his cock and rubbed the tip in my pussy lips. "This is how I'm going to make you happy."</p> <p>"Yes dear." Was all he said.</p> <p>I rubbed his balls and his shaft and his whole cock-head came out of my lips, a dollop of precum glistening at its tip. "I hope to make you happy." I took his head in my mouth and swirled my tongue around his head. It got harder while I continued to rub his cock-head around my lips. Then I sucked on it until it felt as if it was about to jump out of my mouth. A drip of precum came out the tip and I licked it off. I opened my mouth wide and took him in my mouth. Now I was completely engulfing his entire cock. In fact, it was my first time. This was the first time I had received any oral stimulation all day. Just how much I had wanted to feel his cock in my mouth. "What do you think?" I asked, giving a knowing smile.</p> <p>Mr. Holmes nodded. "Oh God I've wanted to do that for so long."</p> <p>"Is it my favorite part?" I asked.</p> <p>"No dear. You know it. You're the best piece of candy the world has to offer." Mr. Holmes said. He held onto the back of my head. After all of the teasing I'd been through he just let me go. But today I wanted his cock all the way in my mouth again. I was glad he had my cherry out of the way. After a few minutes, I had his whole cock in my mouth. I loved the sensation while it was fully embedded in my mouth. "I love how you can make me cum so quick."</p> <p>"I have to try," said Mr. Holmes.</p> <p>I put my hands on the back of his chair and straddled his lap. I was glad he had his hands on the back of my thighs as I sucked harder and faster on his cock. I wanted him cumming in my mouth and cumming so fucking hard. When I was close enough I pulled away from his cock and told him to sit up.</p> <p>I got off of his lap, which he did with a plop. Then I started unbuttoning my shirt. When I had my shirts off I sat back on the floor, my panties still around my thighs. Mr. Holmes stood up and undid his pants. I watched as when they reached his ankles he got down on his knees and then spread my legs. He took his cock in his hand; just a wisp of hair coming down the sides of his thick cock and the tip of his head. He rubbed the tip up and down my pussy lips and my clit with his finger. At I whimpered in excitement. "Does that feel good dear?" I asked. He didn't answer so I put my finger over his lips. He stopped masturbating me and said "Not so long dear, I'm really close to cumming. I want to cum inside you."</p> <p>"Oh please dear." He wasn't begging. In fact I was eager to feel him inside.</p> <p>"Please Sir, I just want your cum." I looked into his face and saw desperation and love written there. Then he pulled my body closer to him. We were practically on the floor. I knew where our bodies were going. With one last quick stroke on his cock I felt him go even deeper than before. "Oh yesss."</p> <p>"Yes dear." Was all he said again. When he saw me starting to orgasm I grabbed the back on the floor and said, "Yay, dear, please dear." his eyes. I felt his cock go deeper, "Oh god." he couldn't finish it." I was on his face. . not stop. "Yess! I was thereâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
