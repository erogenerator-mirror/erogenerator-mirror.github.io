And the sound of her father, Mr. Jones’s grandfather who was now the senior of the family that produced the last of those old cartoons was still there, as was his wife, Elizabeth, who had been born on the fifteenth and eighteenth of April in July, as had everyone else at the family mansion in London.</p> <p>As a young girl, Mrs. Jones had been blessed with excellent physical education, but when she finished high school in her first year of college the first thing she learned in bed was that the joys of the world were far from over, and sex did not fall into the category of the most fun-filled experiences, the kind that gave you the most fun every day.</p> <p>And now, Mrs. Jones was on her way to her son, her twenty-year-young adult son. The news was so good, even if she had been looking to see if she could still fall for the one, who was the man she fell in love with, the way that she had fallen for her husband.</p> <p>It was as if her body had been designed to make this relationship something she would never be able to break free of in her life.</p> <p>Mrs. Jones knew that, in a million years, she would be able to stay true to the good of her family. But when her marriage, well it was a mistake, went south, something was missing here. Not like she could really take home her husband, even though she had been to Europe to stay with him. Something was missing there, something that had to be met and determined. Something that was the way for it to be done.</p> <p>It was not just the sex that was lacking, it was the lack. Mrs. Jones did not feel any different about the sex, and even if she liked sex it was not the great pleasure of having it, the great, powerful release that she enjoyed every moment her husband was alive and well. And she didn't want to talk about the sex with her children and her grandchildren. She wanted to save a marriage where nothing sexual could ever happen, when all that she had ever wanted in the world was a life with the man that was always there in her bed. If she could keep a family that did everything together for her just one weekend a year, it would be an end, a good life that she could live proud of.</p> <p>As a good Catholic, however, she could not do anything more than have sex with her daughter, as long as her son was her first lover when she was fifteen.</p> <p>But when she was twenty-eight it was not enough, and while it had been a couple of years since the last time she had had sex with a man or a woman, she felt she should have had sex with someone who had just married her. She felt that at forty-five years old she had just as much as she wanted for sex with her first lover, someone who had made her feel wonderful sexually, and when she was older, she wanted more and more for this kind of attention.</p> <p>On that level of the sexual situation, however, there was no other way. Only what was best for her when she could afford to let herself loose and allow the freedom of love to come out when she wanted it, and she was now fully in love with her son.</p> <p>And after she graduated she needed to have sex with someone else.</p> <p>Mrs. Jones had always been able to keep her sex life down with only masturbation, of course. She had always had a fetish for being naked and being taken by someone else. She had also never let on to whom she had been. If she had been alone and with her father she would give up, to save herself. She wanted the best of both worlds.</p> <p>But now, as if she was a religious girl whose mother had just turned sixty, she wanted to have what she wanted and did it with her son. She wanted to share it with him again, to return to the way they had all been when she was home and home alone.</p> <p>Her hand was trembling, her heart pounding in her chest. Her heart was pounding too, but now she couldn't speak. She just knew that there would be a lot of people who would be listening.</p> <p>***</p> <p>John was on his way back from school. He was not really a big kid at all, of course, when he was in his late thirties. He was shy, not really in the mood for being asked about a particular subject or a book, and didn't talk about it often. He was always polite to be polite, after school at the door and because she told her parents that she was sick and that it was her best for him to come home. No, so she could go. She could spend time with him and never to be when she felt safe and she should just to keep an open her house that they had to—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
