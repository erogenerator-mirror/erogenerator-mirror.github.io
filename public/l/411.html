Toward</strong> the end of his rope, when his cock was standing up straight, when his hand slipped through the hole to find, to stroke, a woman.</p> <p>It wouldn't have occurred to anyone else, who would be in the vicinity. In a time when every person in the world knew about him, and with all that was happening around him, every thought was focused on the woman being stroked by the man whose hands, his eyes, his fingers, his mouth and his penis were pleasuring the woman whose hand was doing all that in her ass. It was too much for anyone else to imagine. In less than an instant, it turned his thoughts into nothing more than a lust filled cloudburst of sexual desire.</p> <p>In the same instant, it wasn't that he was fantasizing about any woman, or that other men were around. What sort of man would be attracted to a beautiful, sexy, passionate, horny woman like her? All of that was just imagination. In that moment, it was more than that. It was more the thought of her. All along it was a sexual and sexual fantasy. It was a dream of his. It was a fantasy of a beautiful, sexy, sexy woman. All along, it was more than that. It was all around him. Everything about him. Including, the obvious one: his name.</p> <p>But of course, the dream wasn't all that clear. Or, if it was, it was more like he was picturing just the woman of his dreams. He didn't have any experience with women before, anyway, and he didn't know women before, though he suspected he could be the one. He didn't know what women looked like. Only, what men would think of his fantasies, what women might think of his fantasies, to imagine himself with women who were his dreams, and to know how their lips and tongues would feel on his cock.</p> <p>To make the experience even more arousing, and more sexual, he was thinking of a woman standing before him, naked, her legs pulled up, her mouth open, her tongue teasing him, her cunt wet and swollen. And she was giving him pleasure. He imagined her cunt was so wet and slippery, he could feel the warmth emanating from it. She was so beautiful.</p> <p>In more recent times, he had fantasized about a few women too, but with less experience than he had had previously, he had lost interest in many of them. And, he had enjoyed the experiences of women his age, with women his own age, too. But in the past, a fantasy of someone like this was always one of the things he dreamt about. He could imagine, with total sexual experience, a woman from his past doing this for him. And, he would have done it for a woman in his past if he and his fantasy woman had been there. Only, it wasn't a fantasy at all. In fact, when this thought crossed his mind, he didn't even realize what it was, except for it having entered his subconscious, at least in a conscious and subconscious way.</p> <p>It was one of the most erotic and sexy things he had ever done. As if it was somehow real, it certainly was. It was erotic enough to make him feel sexy and sexually aroused all at once. It was like he was in a dream.</p> <p>It was almost as if he was fantasizing about his fantasy woman. Even on the bed at his wedding to the same woman, he imagined her kneeling upon the mattress atop the pillows in front of him. And, as if he was her lover in the world again, they would resume kissing. And, after a while, he would fuck her. He would fuck her in that way in which he had never imagined, or even dreamed, but then again, the only way he would end up fucking her was in the act of fucking her in front of an audience.</p> <p>There was an erotic, hot feeling in the way his imagination filled him up with this fantasy woman, in the way he imagined seeing her riding him, in the way he imagined seeing her being fucked as if a bicycle, riding on a stationary bicycle. And the erotic, sexual, erotic feeling that coursed through him, through him, was the way, the only way, the only way, to continue.</p> <p>As if their kisses were coming from an imaginary lover's kiss, they would continue to kiss. He imagined her kissing him before. He imagined her kissing him on the lips.</p> <p>"God, I love to kiss," he whispered to himself, in such a sensual sensual moment. A moment so different from a moment to which he had the greatest sexual, sexual, incestuous, and emotionally erotic feelings of love. Only, and, as if possible, could be. For, could, could he.</p> <p></p> <p>A dream, you love.</p> <p>Love.</p> <p>Love, For love,</p> <p>For love Love—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
