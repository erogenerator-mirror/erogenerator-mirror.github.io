Youth is the season for prompt welding and the rapid healing of scars. Marius breathed freely in Courfeyrac’s society, a decidedly</strong> liberal environment. As a student-athlete, he didn’t usually take a life. He preferred the safe refuge of a doctor’s office to a doctor’s private practice, a place where he could take classes and do much more. But this is exactly where his life led him, behind the wall. He lived here because he knew that it was right.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The day came to pass quickly and as promised, the sun was setting as a gentle breeze caressed her soft flesh. As a student in class, she was still quite shy. Even students were never too shy around her. She couldn’t tell you how many times she had to kiss a man to get to class to do that. Most of her teachers were in different classes than she was. Her class was one of the last to pass as the sun began to warm the classroom. She was thankful for the window shades covering her blinds when she was done. The whole class was a riot as they made their way to class. Marius had no idea how to talk to a teacher because she was always too distracted with her thoughts or projects or her classmates.</p> <p>She finally reached the classroom to give her instructor’s name, Marius. The instructor was her boss, the one who always gave her such a hard time. Marius, not being a man of great wealth, was very busy. Although she hated the job, she loved the work just like it was. Marius’s skills with the computer in her class were really useful and he was always there for her without having to bother with her. This didn’t sit well with Marius. She didn’t even recognize him. Just because she had never met him, Marius made her feel a little better. Marius was a good teacher, a good worker and he was always at her work whenever she needed it. He had a bright personality and he was even more handsome. He had the brightest blue eyes Marius had ever seen. Marius, despite being only eighteen, felt that she would lose her job if she ever came back without him. She knew that she would make a good teacher if she didn’t want to leave.</p> <p>Marius was feeling very awkward with the whole class now. All the girls from the first semester had left him with no other option but to say goodbye. He couldn’t have done it without her. She was the most beautiful, caring and intelligent woman he had ever met. Even if he couldn’t have known how good she was in bed, Marius knew that he would love her. She was a young lady, yet the sweetest and brightest blue-eyed freshman he had ever encountered. There was one problem though, she was married but didn’t seem the type to give up a chance to date. The way Marius was looking at her, the way he was smiling and laughing at Marius, it was like all the other students in class were just smiling at him. The fact that the teacher was married didn’t bother Marius as he was a good-looking man. Marius didn’t really feel the need of a woman in his life. He didn’t care for the idea of marrying a teacher. He knew that some people found his work as a teacher interesting, but he just never saw anyone else in his field of vision.</p> <p>Marius didn’t see a particular problem for her when she went into the classroom to do his homework. She kept her arms in her lap and as she tried to concentrate, Marius saw her. Her eyes seemed to be glowing with a kind of energy she didn’t recognize. Marius had no idea what it was. She was so much younger than him, but he knew that she was pretty. Marius didn’t see that any matter, all the attention was all there to her. As a student in class, he found all that attention incredibly flattering, so he paid attention to what the teacher was doing. Marius knew what teachers were doing, even she was one of them in the classroom. Marius was used to paying attention to his teachers. He felt like he was doing a lot of stuff, and he hadn’t really got a chance to practice much until today.</p> <p>Marius felt incredibly aroused at the thought of some guy doing something sexy for her. The idea of watching him while she was done was just so sexy. She liked that idea. The thought of him making her cum just made her more excited. Marius was so much stronger now, so when he took it slow and forceful like a teacher, she felt like when she was being used, it. She got to him excited to do to do something special things in an even. He made her a little things for her body even. Marius. She did things like the things for her and to him, like that he knew—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
