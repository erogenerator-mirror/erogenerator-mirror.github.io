I should be writing, while wearing my own office, and having some of my staff, at my keyboard; writing, while watching my own students.</p> <p>If they are not being written, if they will not have, is what you can't write. If you have too many thoughts about the future.</p> <p>I should be at my desk, having my papers filled, while listening to, and not hearing, of the students and the work of the law, while staring at the students, and staring at the law books, while staring at my computer screen, while listening, when writing, for the students, while listening, as for reading, before going to bed, to the sound of your own sheets, before going to sleep.</p> <p>I should be at my desk, while staring at the students before going to sleep.</p> <p>I should be at my desk, while feeling a warm body against one of my arms.</p> <p>I should feel the warmth of a woman against my arm.</p> <p>I should feel a woman's hand on my shoulder.</p> <p>I should feel a woman's hand on my ass.</p> <p>I should feel a woman's hands against my breasts.</p> <p>I should feel a woman's body.</p> <p>I could feel myself getting warm from a woman touching me. My hands had moved to the front of my pants, while feeling, feeling, feeling; while touching the sides of my breasts, but I didn't even feel my hands. My mind had returned to the classroom, before going to sleep. I had nothing else to concentrate on, except my work, when I was writing, when listening, when dreaming, when having fun.</p> <p>This woman felt warm on my shoulder. She moved a couple of inches to place a hand on my left breast, and as her hand moved, she softly rubbed her fingertips against me. I lifted my arm and brought it up, feeling what it was feeling. She moved it up, and moved it down, feeling, feeling, feeling as her finger touched me.</p> <p>I could feel the warmth of her pussy, on my shoulder when I was wearing panties, when she had not worn any panties, when she had gone from sleeping to wearing her undies. I knew where my fingers were going, when she had pulled my undies down.</p> <p>I heard the sound of her hand moving on me, as I felt her fingers move against my breast before touching me, and feeling the warmth on my breast.</p> <p>I could feel my hand move to her breast, and feel the warmth of her finger against my nipple. I heard her breast softly sigh, with my own moan. She moved her hand again to my nipple, and slowly rubbed up and down, my nipple. I could feel her nipple getting firmer, and growing slightly, before moving to her other nipple, feeling it becoming even harder. I heard her moan, while feeling what her finger was doing, before moving her hand to her own breast.</p> <p>I felt my fingertip moving over my nipple, as her breast came together with her nipple. It touched me while her finger was against me, and my finger was touching her. I could feel each of her nipples against my finger, as her breast was touching me.</p> <p>I lifted my head, looking at her, just as she lifted her mouth to mine, as we kissed, slowly, hungrily, passionately, as we kissed.</p> <p>I could feel the desire in those eyes, as I looked at them. I could feel the desire in those eyes, as my gaze traveled down and down, down to her, to her lips, to her breasts, and down to her pussy.</p> <p>I lowered myself to her, as I felt her legs spread, and pulled her towards me, as her wetness, felt, and enveloped me. I could feel her hands on my back, holding my body up before lifting me up to her. I could feel my lips as they touched her lips, and feeling their warmth. I could feel how warm she was as mine were, with one hand. I knew hers felt warm, too.</p> <p>I lifted my hand, and brought it down to feel her breasts, moving my finger, slowly, around her breasts, down her belly, feeling her ribs, while I felt what I could feel her body with. She could feel warm skin on mine, as I felt that. She was feeling me as I was feeling her, as I wanted her. I could feel her touch as her own skin. I could feel her breasts as they feel the softness, as she had felt hers, as mine.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I lowered myself from leaning to her. I could feel myself to her.</p> <p></p> <p>I could be her.
