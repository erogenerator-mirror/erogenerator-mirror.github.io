He had been given a ticket to accompany the Queen of England to Her Majesty's Theatre, at the Royal Opera House – a theatre to which his cousin, who had once been Queen, died when a theatre crew performed a dramatic production of 'Blasphemy' by a character named Oliver Sade, a former student of literature in the great school of Shakespeare, called the 'Queen-Of-the-Fours'. The trip to his hotel to meet his queen at midnight seemed like all the more exciting than the journey home. Oliver's mother took great delight in bringing him off by giving him a very naughty, but also quite pleasant, French-virgining blowjob whilst, just after finishing the delicious champagne, she pulled her panties aside. Oliver was so excited by what had happened today; he found himself wishing that tomorrow was tomorrow – and that night, if his mother did indeed take him home, he would have plenty of champagne – the way a young boy does when he's feeling horny at the end of his first date. Oliver's mother did nothing more than blow him a kiss or to be kissed, but was even more fun as she kept encouraging him to come closer while, later, to fuck her.</p> <p>The Queen-of-the-Fours was at his hotel when he reached his home to collect his luggage -- he'd been told a hundred times to make sure his room and its bathroom were to his liking, and the luggage he was to carry would be most welcome to the Queen. He had absolutely no desire to wear a suit, but his mother, who was to be a lady when the weather was warm, and his uncles too, seemed to have no such qualms about him being naked. He entered the house to get his clothes; his mother was already waiting, her arms full of flowers and candles, waiting by the front door, her own candle burning.</p> <p>Oliver could feel the soft, feminine touch of his mother as she walked towards him, but it seemed as though, when his mother bent down and kissed his lips passionately, he could feel all the excitement evaporate from his body. When their lips parted, he could then see her smile, and her hands pulled his clothes out of his suitcase. He was almost fully erect and she bent down to touch him, rubbing him while he undressed.</p> <p>He'd been feeling very horny from the morning and morning, and his desire to be fucked had grown stronger, and, in fact, he did it as his mother, kissing him passionately, and then taking him in her mouth. He was about to fuck his mother, but he didn't make it a habit of fucking his mother. Instead, he'd come prepared with a condom. He was so ashamed of himself at having taken the virginity of the very sweet and innocent woman who had, once he'd kissed her on her cheek, told him to fuck her. He remembered back when he was still a virgin, when his mother had had a crush on him and, having fucked her, he had taken a condom from the bag and told her to wear it. Now, he was in her bed, naked except for his briefs and a shirt, with his mother, his lover and the beautiful daughter of his friend.</p> <p>His mother did what made him happy. She licked his cock and she sucked his balls and she even ate his ass, and she was the most exciting person in his life for her. She loved to tease him, to tease him mercilessly, but, at the same time, wanted to make love to him. What better way to begin your married life than by fucking the man of your dreams, right up until you realize that you're not in control of yourself – at least, not in any of your previous relationships. He just had to find out, once he thought about what it's like.</p> <p>Oliver's mother held him as he kissed and sucked her breasts and thighs, kissing his way up and up her body, until he came close to her pussy, and once she was wet, he took his cock in his hand and pressed her clitoris to the tip, until she was moaning loudly in anticipation.</p> <p>"Oliver," she said after she took his cock, "make love to me, baby."</p> <p>She guided his cock into her vagina, which was completely soaked with her blood, making it easy for him to enter her. Oliver knew he wouldn't have to fuck her, he knew he would just have to fuck her, because his mother was so beautiful and sweet – and he needed to fuck her. He fucked his mother, until he came in her a second time. She came too, moaning loudly, loving every minute of it. Afterwards, he put the condom on the nightstand in her bed and left his bed and, leaving his condom, while she lain to sleep. The one night and his other.</p> <p>***** had slept, the night to sleep, he wondered—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
