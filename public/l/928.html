Where was she? What was she doing?</strong></p> <p>A thought occurred to me that I had been thinking long enough since I had had sex with my woman and it had all been meaningless sex.</p> <p>I had been getting very horny and my wife and my girlfriend had been giving me a lot of advice. I had wanted to try something new with my new girlfriend.</p> <p>My new girlfriend had been a pretty good fuck however but I guess I had been feeling pretty bad for her in the end for sure. I did all I could to give her a good fucking but she was obviously not going to allow that. That is not the kind of thing to forgive. That's always the case with me. Just because I loved her didn't mean I had to get sex with her.</p> <p>I looked over to my girlfriend and she was on her back with a huge strap-on dildo firmly wedged inside her cunt. Her eyes shot open and she just stared at me in pure pleasure. I smiled at her back. I love it when my girlfriends are just like that.</p> <p>My girlfriend smiled back and just looked at me for a long moment. She then said, "Are you going to take me?"</p> <p>I grinned at her back and stood up behind her and once again began fucking my girlfriend. I pulled my cock out and placed it near her asshole and then pulled it up and pushed it inside her. It took a moment for me to get it in and it slid in with amazing ease. I placed my hands under her thighs and began pushing inside her with the same speed that she had fucked me. Soon I had my hand underneath them and began playing with her clit.</p> <p>"This feels so good!" she moaned.</p> <p>"This feels great!" I replied back.</p> <p>After a minute or so, I placed my hand on her clit and began rubbing it furiously. My girlfriend let out a sexy, throaty reply. I smiled to myself as I knew that I could have her from that moment on. I leaned over her back and began kissing her neck.</p> <p>"Oh yeah baby..." she said softly as I kissed her. "Keep it going."</p> <p>So I continued to kiss and bite her neck while rubbing her hard clit. It only took me a few minutes for her to reach her orgasm. She shuddered and moaned in a long, long moan as she released her cum onto my fingers.</p> <p>I was just about to change positions when my girlfriend looked over at me from the chair. She then motioned me towards her and said, "You can try to do so now." My girlfriend then gave me a playful slap on the ass followed by another hard smack of hers with the strap-on dildo on her ass.</p> <p>I smiled at her and placed my hand under her legs and pushed myself inside her ass with ease. I looked down at her and saw that her eyes were all red with lust and it looked to be the sexiest thing I had ever seen.</p> <p>It was her first time having anal sex and so I really had no problem taking her. I simply kept thrusting in and out of her while massaging her clit.</p> <p>"Awwww... that feels good." She said between moans. "It's getting me really horny."</p> <p>"I can feel you getting even horny." I replied back as I continued to make myself cum.</p> <p>When I began to orgasm, I looked at my girlfriend who had her eyes closed and a smile on her face. She then looked over and looked at the other person I was fucking.</p> <p>"Are you ready for me to fuck him?" she questioned me.</p> <p>I nodded.</p> <p>"Then I want you to fuck him like you did me."</p> <p>I smiled at my girlfriend. She reached up and grabbed the dildo and began to slap her clit with it. "Oh yeah."</p> <p>My girlfriend giggled. I grabbed her hand and started slapping her clit faster. I moved my other hand inside her as she did the same to herself.</p> <p>It didn't take long before both of us came with an simultaneous moan. I was very excited by having the other person watching me jack myself off into my girlfriend who was now rubbing her clit furiously.</p> <p>There was no doubt my girlfriend would have liked this position as she was extremely horny and she loved every second of it. My girlfriend must have really enjoyed the show because she kept rubbing and pinching her clit until she finally grabbed a hold of herself and looked over my shoulder.</p> <p>"Oh! Wow!"</p> <p>"You like that, huh?" I asked her.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><|></p> <p></p> <p>"I'd that's very hot stuff sexy.</p> <p>. Oh yeah very sexy. baby, that was you did I like that's good. baby. I mean that felt good! I think, I think your girl. I like you like the thought—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
