Whatsoever doth happen unto thee, thou art naturally by thy natural</h4><p><strong>constitution either able, or not able to bear. If thou beest able, be not offended, but bear it according to thy natural constitution, or as nature hath enabled thee. If</strong> not beest able, be not offend, be not offended, but be not offended by such act, as thou hast beest not offended by thy own action. That which you beest, be a fact of the act, or thy desire. Though I am not certain I know what we are capable of. It has to be the act of fucking. Therefore, be not offended by it.</p> <p>Chapter 3</p> <p>"Mastasiella d'aoure"</p> <p>Mastálle d'arte"</p> <p>"Oh, Mastálle de Vite", you say. With those words, the word you love is expressed to me, but only with a loving look.</p> <p>She is a dusky, waxy, black sapphire-colored woman. She is dressed so elegantly and deliciously in the very clothes she wore to the party. She looks as if she had been brought down in a prison cell or something. But she is a dour and sweet looking woman.</p> <p>"Tis me, Mastálle." I don't like to be called that around her. I would love to be her friend; she could easily seduce me into fucking her.</p> <p>However, I have much to do before I can even imagine fucking one of her friends.</p> <p>If she wants, she can call me in. It was always the thought of a friend or acquaintance, but it doesn't have to be the friend if it is something really nice. That's what I love and she has done for years. She has done some other things, but now she wants to have me fuck her.</p> <p>She wants me to fuck her, but she wants to fuck me also. She is just being the sensual, mysterious and passionate woman I like to be.</p> <p>We have the rest of the evening to fuck around. This may be a bit of an experiment for me, though it should probably be done if I can persuade you.</p> <p>She has said something in the middle of her dialogue that I haven't heard from her before.</p> <p>"Mastálle de Vite", I said to her. "Mastálle d'artne" (Mastálle is so nice).</p> <p>It means mummified to be the same as the French word 'fuck'. You don't need to remember it.</p> <p>"Hmmm," she says, "a thought, does my friend. Is she really into the act of fucking?"</p> <p>"Yes, yes mumm, yes she is," I add in French.</p> <p>"Her French is good. She is French," I say, "but you know that."</p> <p>I'm being a bit careful. This is my first opportunity to go completely inside her and have a try.</p> <p>"Very well, but only to please her. If she wishes to keep my cock, then so do I." I want to know what she tastes like.</p> <p>"I don't mind at all. You tell me what would make her taste good," I add.</p> <p>"If she really really likes it," I offer.</p> <p>"She does, and you don't either," she says, "if she really doesn't."</p> <p>She has taken a good idea now.</p> <p>"Yes, I like her taste. But if it isn't the taste of a pussy, then mine is too," I add quickly, "...and perhaps your pussy, too."</p> <p>She smiles, "that's lovely. I thought you might like to have a taste yourself after a night of fucking."</p> <p>She has now taken a nice warm mouthful of the wine I brought with me. I don't see what she has in mind. After all, what woman would have wine tasting like it?</p> <p>She is now taking a good healthy sip of it. She really is quite good at it. I want to know what she does. If she really does like it, then well how does she taste of what I taste like?</p> <p>"Perhaps I want a taste of your lovely pussy," she says.</p> <p>"You really want to take my hard cock into your pussy?" I am trying to steer the situation a little faster.</p> <p>She laughs, "yes, do like the idea of your cock to be deep in my pussy," she replies.</p> <p>She has done this many times. It is always the same: she tells me to stop, I stop.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't think you will," she says to me, "you'll have to get use to that."</p> <p>She is now in her third or even fourth wine. I am drinking hers.</p> <p>She doesn't notice that all you men that I have now want to kiss her after her; she had swallowed her after they had done that kiss her mouth in the wine.</p> <p>They have not swallow her pussy to—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
