What did Jean Valjean want? To finish what he had begun; to warn Cosette, to tell</strong> her where and when and to tell her more about the time he stopped on those short notice visits. The sex had been good, but he had been hard again. And he had told her that in a week, and a half, and a few months, and a couple more.</p> <p>"Come, Cosette!" his grandfather bellowed and pulled her into the bathroom. His hand had been in her pants. He had been in her pants. He had been in the pants of a man she had never met on a regular basis. He had been in her pants. He had been in her pants. He had always been in her pants.</p> <p>They had both cried at the same time. He had been crying because he enjoyed watching her cum on his fingers because the way those big, tight, wet cuntfolds of hers felt when she came in his mouth had made him hard again. She had been crying because she enjoyed him having seen. And he had had enjoyed seeing and hearing her have orgasms. They had both had and enjoyed each other's orgasms.</p> <p>"That's enough of that," his grandfather shouted at her. "The bathroom's got a lock. Go take your clothes off."</p> <p>She had tried to get away, but he was too strong. And she felt the cold iron on her shoulders. She turned her head and she saw his face. He was angry that he had left her in the state she was in; too angry that he had left her in the state she was in. And they both knew that if ever, ever she did again with a more dominant than her husband, that way could take over everything.</p> <p>Now, she had lost all hope of winning with him. She had also gained so much confidence. It was in the feel of his hand on her, the feel of his fingers on her clit, in her cunt, and in her ass and in her mouth that her mind couldn't erase. She was wet. Her ass and her cunt were wet.</p> <p>The door from her bedroom opened and she heard a sound, almost a gasp, then was replaced.</p> <p>"Hello, you hot little fuck slut," the voice said, it was Cosette. And even without her realizing it, she was turned on. She was surprised by what she was hearing. She was even more surprised by how turned on she was by the whole thing.</p> <p>The way he had been speaking to her had done it. It had said everything to her. And there was no mistaking that she was wet. She felt like she was already over the edge as he had been speaking. She couldn't help it. It was a thrill to be naked while being touched in all her slutty, private places for him.</p> <p>She felt him turn away. She heard him close the bathroom door and she felt his hands on her and then another man's hands on her clit, caressing and pressing it. Just then, and only that second, he turned away and she heard him enter the bathroom. And again, and again, and again. It was only the sound of what he had been saying and doing together with what she was feeling. And in the bathroom, she was sure, he was being watched.</p> <p>She heard him moving about, and she could hear that he was getting her ready.</p> <p>"Come here, slut," he told her over and over again.</p> <p>And she did. She was on his knees looking up and staring up at his hard, muscular body, with her tits jiggling and the muscles in his legs flexing, waiting for her. She could see that he was naked. She could see his cock, though, and that it was huge and hard against his belly.</p> <p>She wondered what it would feel like to fuck him, to be fucked hard and deep with that big, long, hard cock against her face. She wondered about their history together. She wondered if he would ever be able to fuck her and if she could ever do that and that she could do it and let him do it. She wondered about his future with her, but she was not ready to be married yet, not yet.</p> <p>He came back over to the bed and straddled her legs on either side of her feet, taking up a sitting position. Then he got down, and pulled her arms behind her head so that she had to look up in the mirror and watch.</p> <p>And he was so fucking strong. And his cock was so big and so hard that it stretched her with every thrust. But it was also wet and slick and soft and warm and it slid into her like a hot, wet, wet cock. It felt good and not to her. It had felt good. Like he was going in her hand, like he was going in her. Like he was going all around her. He was going. Just when he was going everywhere.</p> <p></p> <p>Cosette knew—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
