Timid smiled at Mala on the shoulder and hugged his mother. She too had kissed him once. Mala had kissed him for himself. She had wanted him to kiss her. The kiss was soft and sweet.</p> <p>"Mom- you make me so happy now, so happy."</p> <p>"It makes me happy too."</p> <p>'It makes you love me,' Timid thought to himself. 'It makes us happy.'</p> <p>Timid had kissed her. He had kissed his mother- he had kissed his friend. He had kissed him like a boy. His parents' love was a thing of the past. It was their passion that had turned him on like that. He had kissed his mother in an incestuous way.</p> <p>He had been kissing his mother, but he had never said those words. It had happened so quickly. He knew that no one had ever said it so gently and innocently. No one ever spoke the word 'love'. Timid knew that no one had ever had any kind of feeling about being a virgin. Even no one had ever felt the shame of kissing a woman and feeling the desire of being a man in the process...</p> <p>'What am I doing?' Timid thought. He looked at his mother- his naked body standing in front of him, his eyes gazing into hers.</p> <p>'I'm still a teen- my dick is still in my shorts and my mind is still in my shorts.'</p> <p>'It's a good thing,' Timid thought, 'he already has a boner.' He couldn't believe how nervous he was. And the excitement of the moment was still too much.</p> <p>'Can you imagine what it's going to be to feel my dick inside,' Timid thought and shook his head. There was no way that he was going to go through with his plan but he couldn't go to sleep with his face in her bosom. He was going to have a heart beating on her heart. And if his heart was beating with Mala, then it was just fine because he felt his dick starting to rise. And if he felt his mommy's heart beating with his classmate, he was going to have the joy of losing his virginity to her. He was about to lose it all and there was only one solution at all. He had waited a lifetime.</p> <p>'Wait a lifetime? How is that possible? But I'm getting hard.'</p> <p>'You shouldn't,' he thought, 'if his penis is growing it will only be two seconds. I'm not the only one feeling good in my life.'</p> <p>"Mom," Timid said hesitantly, "can I ask something of you?"</p> <p>"Sure," her response and smiled at him. He hugged her and held her like he had hold at a wedding. She held him just a little tighter.</p> <p>"Mom, when I asked what you feel like today and after you kissed me," Timid asked, "I realized that I had said this a thousand times."</p> <p>He realized his mistake. He couldn't stop himself from admitting his feelings to his mother. He could feel himself going hard and his boner was sticking even harder inside his shorts and pants. He couldn't stop himself from feeling his own excitement.</p> <p>"Mom," Timid said feeling like he had betrayed his own body by saying what he did, "I meant it when I said you made me happy."</p> <p>"No you don't," she said with a weak smile from her closed lips. She suddenly realized she had said that one of the few words that any son would ever say to her. She thought he was going to kiss her again. She decided to give Timid another opportunity.</p> <p>"You never have to say anything, mom!"</p> <p>"What?" Mala giggled playfully.</p> <p>Timid kissed his mother.</p> <p>"This is so perfect for your first time," he said softly. "This is so perfect."</p> <p>"I always thought you would ask me to marry you when I said you made me happy," Mala said and smiled at him, "but I realized that when you kissed me first- it was the truth!"</p> <p>"Are you sure?" Timid asked.</p> <p>"Oh yes!"</p> <p>"Mom, can I ask you something?"</p> <p>"Of course, boy!"</p> <p>"Do you want me to keep my virginity?"</p> <p>'Uhmm- okay," she replied. After this moment he should have been mad at her for letting him kiss her. But here, he was feeling a bit of happiness in it. Sheela on his face. Now she was feeling good about him. In her son. She really meant what she was happy.</p> <p>"Mommy son what?" Mala mom?"</p> <p>"Mom, I'm everything—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
