What is the present estate of my understanding? For herein lieth</h4><p><strong>all indeed. As for all other things, they are without the compass of mine own will: and if without the compass of my will, then are they as dead things</strong>.</p> <p>Chapter 8:</p> <p>After three months of our sexual relationship had fallen into a whirl of lust and arousal, we had decided on a week at which to experiment some bondage and sex. The following was the list of things we thought we would try.</p> <p>First, we found a local bar a week later to go to, (the owner, of whom we called Sir Thomas). He was on vacation, from his home in Bermuda. He and his wife, Mrs. (a widow with two young children), had been our maid of honor to be married just before he was due to fly overseas.</p> <p>We enjoyed the drinks and flirted a bit more with each other. The night progressed on, with me kissing him (his hand had not yet been in my blouse or bra). Then he turned to go to the bathroom. I took the lead when he was through the doorway, and knelt behind him, unbuttoning his shirt. I had never seen that sight before. To anyone else, a sexy show must be a very sexy scene. However, to a married couple, it wasn't. He was standing there, shirtless, and I was licking his nipples like they were candy, and rubbing the fabric of his pants over the flesh of his stomach and his crotch area, and, after a few seconds of that, he was pulling off his pants. I think he expected, and I really didn't have to expect, his dick to begin to poke out. I had been a virgin when we started dating, and I knew I really wanted my first time experiencing sex, not just being taken forcefully, but with a strong man's strength, and I would enjoy the full experience afterwards too. Then, as he pulled down his pants, his long penis was exposed. I took it in my mouth, like it had been a long time since I had been without. We went into the bathroom and, after a few brief moments of "fun" (see, a "good" blowjob) he stood behind me and started to fondle my breasts. I enjoyed that a lot while we did that, and my panties were quite wet so he used it to play with my pussy. I know my ass was too. It was really hot to the point of coming, and all the while, I couldn't stop the small sounds that come from me, when my vagina muscles tighten and my ass tighten.</p> <p>So, his penis was fully erect and the tip of it was rubbing my pussy lips. I didn't know where to go. I tried everything I could think of that I couldn't do. I pulled his penis into my mouth, trying to get it as deep as possible. I was afraid of choking, but I had no problem doing that. He came in my mouth, very deeply, without letting my mouth get to that area. That left my mouth full to make myself come, or at least give it a good blowjob.</p> <p>We laughed a little as we took our clothes off and went into the room. He made us drink wine, then helped us get undressed, and we took off our clothes all the way. My husband had a wonderful penis, and it did, as I have mentioned, give me a lot of pleasure.</p> <p>He walked on the bed and put his large penis near my pussy again. He spread my legs apart and began to stroke my clitoris in a circular motion, as if to be sure he had found out the proper way to do that. His hands were so exciting, rubbing the skin on my stomach, and I was getting wetter and wetter. I enjoyed it for a long time. I didn't want to be too rough, but he said,</p> <p>'Not too rough, darling, that's much better'.</p> <p>He continued to rub my clitoris, making me feel like I was an object. There was even a soft voice in my head, say, 'He's so big, darling, he'll make me come - will you do that for me, oh, please, may I, oh, please'. I couldn't take it any longer.</p> <p>'Yes, indeed you will, darling, you're so ready'.</p> <p>'Yes, of course, darling, I'll do anything for you... you can go ahead, do whatever you want.'</p> <p>He moved over to my head and gently positioned my face in front of his crotch. He pulled me forward and I took his penis into my mouth again while stroking and sucking it for all its length. I would get more of it than I could do before he got hard. It seemed he was close already.</p> <p>He asked,</p> <p>'Would you like some pleasure, now?'</p> <p>to which I replied, . Then, as if it came to which I replied 'I'll go ahead... but do anything with you' and do whatever' I did the best to which I said.
