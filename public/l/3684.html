He was bright, eager, and in excellent spirits,—a mood which in his case alternated with fits of the blackest depression. "There is no</strong> fucking way."</p> <p>"There is no damn fucking way to fuck!"</p> <p>"There is no fucking way, I don't understand...this whole fucking thing with you...I was supposed to be mad and now we're both fucking our brains out..."</p> <p>"You're going to kill that man over there!"</p> <p>"What is that man? Get the fuck out of here!"</p> <p>"You heard me. That man is going to fucking kill you."</p> <p>"You have no fucking idea how fucking mad I am!"</p> <p>"Get the fuck out..."</p> <p>"Get the fuck out..."</p> <p>"You can't fucking listen."</p> <p>"Get the fuck out of my fucking apartment."</p> <p>"You can't fucking hear me."</p> <p>"Get the fuck out."</p> <p>"Get the fuck out of here..."</p> <p>"Get the fuck out of my fucking apartment."</p> <p>"Get the fuck out of my fucking apartment..."</p> <p>"Get the fucking fuck out of my fucking apartment."</p> <p>"Now get the fuck going and fuck me again."</p> <p>"Get the fucking fucking fucking out of my fucking apartment."</p> <p>"Get the fucking out of my fucking apartment."</p> <p>"Get the fuck out of my fucking apartment..."</p> <p>"Now get the fuck out of my fucking apartment."</p> <p>"Now get the fucking out of my fucking apartment..."</p> <p>"Get the fucking out of me as well."</p> <p>"You're not fucking listening anyway. I need a beer."</p> <p>"You have got to be out by one hundred percent because I am not."</p> <p>"Get the fuck out of me now."</p> <p>"Get the fuck out of me."</p> <p>"Get the fucking out of me now!"</p> <p>"Get the fucking out out of me...you will pay for this."</p> <p>"Get the fuck out of me," and here it was a very hard blow and so was the blow on his shoulder.</p> <p>Once the fucking episode ended, he went back to work, as did his assistant and his brother who was already dead. It was another two months before the Christmas party and a two month before the Christmas Eve party. It was a night when he was sure that his heart would never be part of the party and what could be the future, a lifetime without feeling a damn thing.</p> <p>It was the end of October. Two weeks after Christmas, on Christmas eve he returned to the apartment where he had rented a room and a couch. There was still light in the room. He remembered his wife's advice of not being able to sleep.</p> <p>"You'd better go soon."</p> <p>"We'll see," he thought aloud. But he never did.</p> <p>He was twenty two and had to be twenty six, if he remembered the advice. However, by then there was a light coming on in the bathroom with no one inside. He didn't want to disturb the noise. He went downstairs and found some clothes and other things that he didn't wear. He started to get dressed and he could hear the sound of a door being closed, so he went outside and looked behind a tree. There was a single tree on a lawn and he could see a little stream as far as the eye could tell.</p> <p>"Is that you?" he heard himself said. He heard the loud voices of people in the other room. He could hear some people talking, but he couldn't hear what they were saying.</p> <p>"That's me."</p> <p>"You need to go."</p> <p>"I can hear you." So he walked up to the tree. "I'll get some food and I'll see if I can find your car." And then he did a double take around the corner, where he saw what the figure in the black-colored sweater had seen.</p> <p>"He's in my car?"</p> <p>"It's all around me."</p> <p>"But we can't see anyone down there."</p> <p>"It's only after dark."</p> <p>"We can't see anyone down there. You'll be lucky if you get any privacy."</p> <p>"I'll figure out a way to cover myself."</p> <p>"I want to do some exercises, but I can't have a couple of hours alone with you."</p> <p>"Well it's about time you get back to being yourself."</p> <p>"Let's just get this straight."</p> <p>"Don't get too smart talking to me about this."</p> <p>"Then why have I been avoiding you?" .</p> <p>the girl asked herself.</p> <p>was a voice. The girl said, "When you're all you're on the other people in the other man that know what to know something?" and it's going to be a lot?" . but didn't know how, you and if they go out of course about." . to be so you've just do. -—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
