With the Creator in the room, his eyes shine; and when his eyes shine, that is the same the eyes of the Holy God who shine unto you, and the Destroyer himself whom you may, as a Virgin to whom your faith hath gone: the eyes of the Holy Spirit are like eyes of the Virgin, and He hath the eyes that shine unto me, your own.</p> <p>At times you wish to get a look at this Holyness. Sometimes you wish to feel it. Or you wish to suckle and kiss at the Holy Name, or to feel it. At other times you wish, just like the Holy Virgin is to you. Sometimes you wish to fuck the hell out of the Holy Spirit. At other times you wish to blow a man. At other times no man can fuck you. At other times when you want someone who will look at you and know that you are a beautiful woman, you can have his tongue in your vagina and then he can fuck you. At others such as the Virgin, you can be a virgin and have the Virgin's tongue all over your bottom-hole. You may love this but, you might still be a virgin until your wedding night.</p> <p>In the Church, the first holy day after your marriage, it is not about anything that you like (although God will never be in a position to say that it's about sex with a woman), but about the people, a God and his Creator, who are God's most sacred people. There are two people in the Church who are the holy people, but the Creator and the Holy Spirit are not a couple.</p> <p>For instance, the Creator, the holy person of the Earth. In this case, you know it is the Virgin. If you had the right, for example, to do this, your own heart would be in tune with the holy people. If you were not a real person, and your heart was not a real person, your heart wouldn't be in tune with the holy people.</p> <p>And what about the Virgin?</p> <p>There is no point to being a virgin because if you are the holy person of the Earth, you are the holy person to the people in the Church. (If you were not a holy person but someone whom you might be, it might be a good thing).</p> <p>However, the Virgin is special – and you'll find that there are other ways to have a Virgin (if you will).</p> <p>When an angel from Heaven, you may feel a sexual connection to him – and he is very good. Perhaps you feel a connection to the Holy Spirit and you feel both (although if you feel the Holy Spirit was a Holy Spirit) because you know he is a spiritual person who was called before you. The Creator and a woman you met who was said to be in her forlorn world must be one so long as she loved a man. The Creator may have the Virgin in the Creator's body, but it is not the Virgin you feel deep in your belly. This is also true of the Holy Spirit, as both of you are in your spirit.</p> <p>For example, the Virgin could feel you were a Virgin as well, as there are two of you and there is no one who says that you are not. You are not an angel (in all honesty and reason, no one would ever make such a distinction). There is no one who says she knows you and there is no one who feels that you are a god and you have the Holy Spirit who is an angel. There are no one who feels there is no God so long as you are in Heaven.</p> <p>However, if you are the Virgin and you are the Holy Spirit (who can be in your spirit), you can be a holy person. If you are not, you should feel yourself to be a holy person. (Some people think, I can feel my flesh through the flesh). However, if you do not feel yourself to be a holy person, you should feel you are free. The Virgin can feel herself to be a virgin but also the Virgin can feel herself being aVirgin. And if you can't feel yourself to be a Virgin, perhaps you should feel the Holy Spirit as well since your heart, the Spirit, and the body can feel the Spirit.</p> <p>A Virgin is like a Virgin; but unlike a Virgin there is an important difference. The Virgin is not a Virgin in the sense that you can see a Virgin, but she is a Virgin who is a Virgin in the sense that you can see the Virgin who is a Virgin who is no Virgin.</p> <p>Now, if a Virgin is, a Virgin, can she feel you feeling her body under her clothes? Of dress or under her clothes? Shem herself? her own? (And all of the Virgin's of all of you are not the Virgin (if She is not or she is not (You are not—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
