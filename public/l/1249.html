Gavroche thought to himself, this is fun, so long as you don't expect a girl to fuck you. Gavroche took a quick, calculated sip of lemonade, then placed the glass back on his neck. He had never been too anxious to look his best while masturbating, so he made sure to look every sexy bit of his potential. In one motion, he looked down at his crotch that he couldn't quite seem to ignore, found his zipper, whipped it out of the way, and shoved his cock into his right hand, where he'd had the daydreamy dream of fucking Jean Valjean.</p> <p>Gavroche felt a sense of disappointment, however, as he realized that the vision of the goddess would not happen if he kept going. He thought it might cause him to get erect. He made a mental note to check before he gave himself a hard-on too.</p> <p>Gavroche opened his eyes, and saw that he had his right arm wrapped around Jean, his left hand on her left hip. He looked closer, finding his cock already beginning to feel uncomfortably hard. He smiled back, then looked away as he saw how his own cock was pushing down toward his right. He looked back and saw an almost transparent tube covering the end of his erection, and he saw an outline of someone's erect cock under its fabric. The guy's face took on a look that made Gavroche's cock throb again. He could only imagine the way these dank looking dicks looked, and what it would do if he actually shoved it in his ass. No, he didn't think about that right now. Gavroche took his glass off the marble stairway and put it in front of the wall. He then picked up the phone, and dialed a number. "I'm going to be right here, Jean," he said into the mouthpiece. "Where the hell have you been? Call me at your desk! I don't suppose you have class yet?"</p> <p>"Yes," Jean replied in her most seductive voice.</p> <p>When Gavroche got a hold of himself, he didn't need to look up for they were both smiling widely. "I left the window open at the moment. I can get in the window," Gavroche said and stepped toward the window. As soon as he shut it closed behind them, there was no need to look out at the scene to realize it wasn't the girl he was fucking—it was someone else, someone he was fucking, as of yet. Gavroche felt his hand slide along the top of Jean's thigh, and his fingernails dug into the leather of her thigh. The image of her naked body on his lap was quickly gaining the attention of his eyes as he rubbed his hand further and further into her pussy.</p> <p>Jean looked straight down at her pussy, her eyes wide and staring lustfully at Gavroche. With one hand, Jean was pressing his finger hard with as she slowly began grinding her ass against him, using it to stimulate the end of his dick. Jean's head seemed to float back with anticipation of what was coming. Gavroche continued to rub his finger along the top of it, feeling the slick slippery texture of her pussy juice coating his fingers. He felt the softness of her pussy as his fingers lightly tickled it.</p> <p>"God, I have never been so turned on in my life," Jean whispered. "I can feel the orgasm starting and I need to cum now, so fucking badly, Gavroche!"</p> <p>Gavroche couldn't hold back, his penis felt like a rock as she grinded her pussy against it. He lifted Jean's right leg, and then lifted his penis, so that it was right in next to her and aimed up at the opening of her wet pussy. He saw and felt every shudder of Jean's body as she came for him. He knew that he would have a hard time not cumming right then. He was just hoping that he wouldn't lose it too quickly. Instead, it just sort of felt right.</p> <p>With a final shudder, Jean's body began to relax. She just turned her head enough to look at Gavroche, whose mouth was hanging open, and saw that he was sporting a huge grin. "That was amazing, Gavroche," she said again.</p> <p>Then she looked at Gavroche. "So, do you want to get your camera?" she said, not waiting for an answer. She held out her left hand and said, "Come with me, Gav. I'm ready to see the camera." She pulled Gav toward the bed and then she put one hand on the bed, while pushing at the other on Jean's leg and pulled him back to the wall. "C."</p> <p>Jean's.
