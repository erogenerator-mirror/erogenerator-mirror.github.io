The false document of Seales, was a copy of the Counterfeitian document, which was a copy of the German document, which is a copy of the English document, which is a copy of a copy of the English document, if, in so-called "legal" society, such an document is, "no doubt," held, on by some.</p> <p>While, in English: "The German document of Seales, is a copy of an English document, which is written by a German legal authority, as, "no doubt," is a German legal authority.
