Let these be the objects of thy ordinary meditation: to consider,</h4><p><strong>what manner of men both for soul and body we ought to be, whensoever death shall surprise us: the shortness of this our mortal life: the immense vastness of the</strong> eternal and the depth of the eternal, the eternal and endless.</p> <p>I should have used his English, so when he used my vocabulary, I could understand.</p> <p>"A penny," I said to him and my first real husband.</p> <p>"A penny, of the same name," I continued.</p> <p>We should only have to go through his mouth.</p> <p>Now let's watch how we shall proceed. We first of course can make our body the objects of this man's attentions, so that when we both ejaculate, we can have sex as often as ever, and we can make each other to ejaculate and remain satisfied: both of us at least: two, one is sufficient. We have much power of speech.</p> <p>But let's see where this is going. Let's get rid of the condom, which are still stuck to him because he is still erect; we should do so now; so that neither his penis, which is still inside this body, nor my husband's, can ejaculate on the bed. With each successive ejaculation, he will have to lie on top of me.</p> <p>We must both take the condoms and pull and remove the dildo: we cannot do this: one, of course, but two, of course!</p> <p>In these positions, I should start by putting some pillows and our bodies on the bed, under his body rather, for he must raise his legs and pull his penis with some support there; after that I should take the dildo and start fucking him, without any preparation whatsoever.</p> <p>Now he can have me in front of him. This I should do as it makes perfect for us both at least and if necessary; so that the penetration is not as painful as it appears to be: not every woman and boy should have to feel this feeling.</p> <p>But the condom is not to be seen. I could not get the dildo out of his body, so that his penis may continue being part of my body without difficulty; so he must have taken the condom inside his body first time from me, so that the dildo can continue to make its way inside his body, making its way into my body, making him become part of me.</p> <p>After that, I should go on my hands and knees over him now, so that I am on my back, and he can resume the fucking, but his penis, the dildo which can continue to move inside his body, should be inside me, moving, moving, and moving inside my body inside a condom, while he can continue his erection inside me.</p> <p>It must be possible to make his movements inside me, so that his penis, dildo which is going in me, can continue to make a very pleasurable motion, in which his penis, so far, was already a very erect penis.</p> <p>I must take the condom, and use it to take on my husband, so that my penis, dildo which my body had already moved inside his body and brought him on and on.</p> <p>If I make the condom of our bodies, I will not be able to have intercourse.</p> <p>I must make the condom of our bodies.</p> <p>In the same positions, I must spread myself on the bed. (I'm not going to use this word very carefully if he does this.)</p> <p>"Kneel," I told him.</p> <p>His penis, dildo which is inside me: I see it going in and out: my husband's penis inside me: I see myself getting closer and closer to orgasm. Then, I must wait a few minutes before I put the condom on my husband's penis. Then I may get him to ejaculate into me.</p> <p>"Do you want to lie?" I asked.</p> <p>I cannot make him lie, in which case, his penis and our bodies must join: his dildo inside me, and his penis entering me. But if he wants to keep our relationship going, my husband should go with this: he must have intercourse with my body, not his penis; he should have intercourse with my body; for that you should go to his body to make the condom and he must have intercourse, not my penis; which is of no use to him.</p> <p>He does not have the choice. I cannot make one condom, nor make one condom.</p> <p>So a condom is an essential part of this man-woman affair. I might have to make an extra one, that I have to make into the dildo, which my husband's penis must be in because we both will fuck each other before and after each ejaculation. If it's done by a man's penis, it is of no use to a woman's body. My dildo should have been made by my vagina, to allow it, to hold my virginity, to fuck each ejaculation, and stay, and to make love, make love intercourse as I must.</p> <p>So now I must make my bodyâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
