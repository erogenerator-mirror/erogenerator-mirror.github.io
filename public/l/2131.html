Give what thou wilt, and take away what thou wilt, saith he that is</h4><p><strong>well taught and truly modest, to Him that gives, and takes away. And it is not out of a stout and peremptory resolution, that he saith it, but in mere</strong> moments of time, when all that is in its wake is the sun, and the stars are bright and shining. You can always turn on your imagination or your heart, when your love and your passion for and the love that flows from both ways. You can only never hurt and ruin what it is for all that we can do, in love or in pain. Never do the things that could destroy everything or anyone.</p> <p>And, as God is my witness, He can have any word that I say, for all that is in my hearts and in soulsâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
