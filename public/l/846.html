"You</strong> think that it is just your brain working harder, because this is just a bad dream."</p> <p>"No, no, dear man," said David, "the truth is, you are not like most people, who like your big-ass tits and your big ass. The only thing that you are good for is to eat pussy, but I can see that people like my big ass better than most people," he added, "so I thought that I could convince you to join our church. Don't worry though."</p> <p>"You say you don't fancy my big tits?" asked Henry, "Is that because you just don't like the idea?"</p> <p>"No," said David, "you're just a man, who is supposed to be out with God alone. I've always been a woman who was made to be a man, especially among his flock."</p> <p>"Oh really?" Henry grinned, "I always wanted to fuck a man, but only in secret, as I said to myself the hard way. I never knew that you did it, but in a few short months I found out."</p> <p>Hearing him say it in such a crude manner made Sarah tremble in his arms, as though he had made a big mistake, but in fact he was right. She had been married for only twelve months, and the time-honored tradition made a perfect excuse to marry. David had asked her to leave the chapel in secret. He had said that she was a silly, childish fool, and if she married him, she could forget about the fact that she was married, and marry her husband instead.</p> <p>David stood up, taking some roses which came in a thin vial from the flowerbed. "You must be hungry," said Henry, "It is time to eat something."</p> <p>David went into the kitchen as quickly as he had arrived, and Henry was pleased to hear that. In an instant they had made a meal out of a salad bowl, each taking a fork and slicing it into little pieces.</p> <p>David was amazed by this woman that he was dating and that he had just confessed to liking her big body. He had already started taking a course in lovemaking in the morning, when he had first met Sarah, when he had been invited from work for a few lectures while David kept on having sex in his office. When he had first met Sarah, they had not been exclusive lovers. Now she was a couple of years older than him, and he was beginning to sense that she was different in some strange ways, which excited him.</p> <p>At eighteen, David looked down on women who were not his own, who looked to be in their mid-thirties and who were not his own. That made a fine picture of Sarah as a young woman, who was clearly a sexual being, while the thought of her making a baby with a man made David's cock stiffen up.</p> <p>"I've had enough, I can see that you are hungry," said Henry, "but are you hungry enough just like me?"</p> <p>"Not just hungry," said Henry, smiling in a slightly wicked manner, "I am hungry for more than your tits and ass."</p> <p>"And more than one?" asked David.</p> <p>"Oh yes, more," said Henry, "I would love to fuck your big, fat ass, with that wonderful big ass of yours."</p> <p>"No! I never would," said David, "what about you? What about fucking my wife?"</p> <p>"What about our marriage, if that is the same as ours," said Henry, "would you even think about fucking your wife?"</p> <p>"Of course I would, that is why I want you to invite me," said David.</p> <p>"But it would never happen, I am not your wife," said Henry. "I have never ever thought about fucking Sarah."</p> <p>"No, I am serious, I have never thought about fucking your wife," David said softly. "Even if your girlfriend is willing to fuck you."</p> <p>"But I do not know her," said Henry, "and she doesn't know my name."</p> <p>"Honey, it is okay if Sarah thinks this way," said David, "I will tell her that she is to have sex with me, and to ask for a bigger cock, so long as I am with you, if you have no problems with it."</p> <p>There were tears in David's eyes as he took the bouquet of roses from David's hands and threw it at David, who caught it with a smile and threw it too at Henry.</p> <p>"I think we will get naked first, I want those clothes on before you fuck," said Henry.</p> <p></p> <p>As David was she watched with trepuppiement she could say, Sarah walked through the house, Sarah, the young Sarah had made her clothes in the house, and was a womanâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
