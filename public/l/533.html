There had been times, in the past, when he had gotten lucky enough to have just about anything his big-time fantasies demanded of him (and others). His exuberance had come through in his imagination. Now here was the moment of his lifetime. A few times he would say that he was aching for it, aching to give it, but was in his fantasies never having the chance—and being a man at heart.</p> <p>And just like that, the moment was at hand. For just a moment, he was going to do it.</p> <p>He stood, and with each step, the uniform-covered penis grew stronger, a bit longer than before. It was getting hard even with a mere slight adjustment. He reached for its base and pulled it tight against his body, his penis stiff and hard.</p> <p>"Do it!"</p> <p>He stepped forward cautiously until the dildo was pressed between his legs and pressed against the base of the erection. With his hands he gripped it firmly and held it steady. With his feet he began pumping and twisting and thrusting, his hands on the shaft holding the dildo against the base of his penis. He could feel it throb, and could feel the pre-cum on its tip. With each thrust he could barely fit the cock between his legs, and it slipped a bit between his inner leg.</p> <p>"Oh, come here!" a voice called out to him.</p> <p>He looked up and saw a very beautiful woman standing there, her hair, her eyes, like emerald gemstones in a blue sky. She was stunning!</p> <p>She could barely see him, the uniform-clad dildo stretching his vision as his head swiveled upward and he pulled on it. Her breasts jiggled just as he did.</p> <p>"Are you ready?"</p> <p>"Yes I suppose so," was all he could say.</p> <p>"Ready to fuck the living daylights out of a naked man?"</p> <p>He could barely speak, though he tried anyway. "I am, and I am ready!"</p> <p>They embraced together, their bodies pressed tightly together, their hands roaming over the other's backs and legs. He could finally feel the softness there, and his erection became stiffer, harder, and more than a little uncomfortable.</p> <p>"I think I'd better do a demonstration," the voice said.</p> <p>He turned to see who she was, standing there, a strange look on her face.</p> <p>"Of course you do, do a demonstration of your willingness," her voice said with just a hint of sarcasm in it.</p> <p>She pulled of her uniform, freeing her breasts from her black bra. With her breasts freed, she stood there and, bending forward, took her nipples in her own mouth.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she said, turning around and presenting the dildo to him. It was thick, thick, so stiff he could scarcely wrap his hands on it—and he didn't need to.</p> <p>"This won't hurt in any way," her voice said. "All these years I just wanted to see you fuck a man!"</p> <p>"Not just fuck me?"</p> <p>"Not just fuck you," she countered.</p> <p>She put one hand on his lower back and took him gently, guiding him. She pulled on the dildo again and guided it to the base of his penis. He could feel the length of it as it slid further and further out from his body in one motion. He had never imagined that it could go all the way and it did.</p> <p>And then she turned to the side and took his cock in her hand.</p> <p>"Come on, be a man," she said. "Let's see what it feels like to fuck!"</p> <p>This was too much for the poor man. It was going to be more than a day's fucking if he didn't want it, but the thought of what she might do to him was just too good for him to not want it!</p> <p>All he could do with his hands were grab onto the plastic pole and start pumping it. The sensation of the dildo sliding up and down upon himself felt wonderful. He could feel himself starting to come.</p> <p>"M-Mr. RostopchÃn" the voice called out to him. "Do a demonstration of your willingness."</p> <p>He was already at the end of the long line between arousal and orgasm, and when he had been standing there for a moment, his cock had throbbed and been painfully stiff, but, with the assistance of the dildo, the penis had now hardened docked within it was very, very, very, very firm. It had felt the warmth and felt the hardness of his penis in him. Oh, the feeling it seemed to him, the hardness of him, against himself.
