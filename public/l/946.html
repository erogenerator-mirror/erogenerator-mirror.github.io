And he had been drinking steadily, watching a video intently, drinking quite a bit too, and the sight of this young man was a bit too startling for him, but as he drank a little, so did the sight of her - and her body.</p> <p>As he drank, he drank, and his drink started to wear thin, and as he drank, so her began to talk more.</p> <p>She said that she wanted to come to his house - that they could do a lot together. And they could do it right here, right now, right in his house. And he was delighted! And he told her to go and do what she wanted to do, that he was only thinking about her; and she went with him.</p> <p>She said she was sorry, and he said he was too, but that she shouldn't worry, that he was the only guy who was good enough for her - that she seemed to think about him really good too, really well.</p> <p>So they would be together, and she was right here, naked and at his mercy, his cock inside her, his hands stroking her, his lips on hers, touching her, his hands on her breasts and her face, touching her everywhere, in her mouth, on her pussy, on her breasts, on her nipples, on her face, between her legs, on her hair, on her ass.</p> <p>He had always loved the idea, and the feel of her hair, of her skin, of her skin, of her breasts, of her body - the same way as he loved her breasts. When he wanted to suck on her nipples, his hands would rub against the smoothness of her bush, of her pussy, her ass, in her pussy, on the back of her head, over her lips and, especially in her ass - and after only a little while, he would feel her shudder and she would cum.</p> <p>That night they had only been playing with each other; he had not played with her at all - but she had cum anyway. He did not even know what he was doing with his hands, and her body did not respond at all. She said that she had never done this before, and it was a pleasure to feel his dick hardening against her thigh as he began to move inside her - that his fingers felt good inside her. And he wanted to feel good for her.</p> <p>They had only been playing, at first it felt good - nice - but then she began touching his head through his pants. She did it in that tight little grip he had always liked, and his cock was now fully erect, and she reached down and felt it, and he could only take more of her - and he was about to climax.</p> <p>She said she was worried if she was too nervous and too tired, he looked down to his own cock and his eyes met hers and her eyes widened again.</p> <p>Then he looked down again, and she said that she had not really ever done this before - he was supposed to do it with her, right on the dance pole, right in dark, with no lights, but he was still hard, and she knew there would be no need to wear a condom; that she could go slowly and be careful, that she would be as safe as she could be, that he could slide smoothly and smoothly in and out.</p> <p>And she was right. He felt her hand on his penis, caressing it, rubbing it as he pumped her - and then she was on her knees on the altar, taking him in her mouth just from behind, and he knew - and he did too. And she felt him shooting into her mouth, and her lips were as tight as he remembered them ever being. And she was still holding tight to him. Finally he felt that it had been the first time he had cum from touching her like that, having an orgasm from her mouth - and he looked down at his own cock as it slid through her fingers.</p> <p>They were there. They were really not even a little bit concerned about it.</p> <p>"I hope I still haven't forgotten what we have agreed to do," he told her.</p> <p>She nodded. "Of course you haven't forgotten. And I like to feel you do that too, especially sometimes when I really want to take you in your ass."</p> <p>He was right - it wasn't that it really hurt at all - it was just the fact he loved it. It was so good to feel her hands caressing his ass.</p> <p>So they got dressed.</p> <p>They went to his house right away from the rest area, where people might go, and watch for a while they wanted to do that, and talk and drink, and smoke.
