He was lying very much as we had left him, only a little higher, and he</strong> had a full erection just looking at me. His eyes met mine as he handed me a medicine. I have to say that was a rather nice cock you have there. The captain was very impressed with it though. I smiled at him.</p> <p>"You know the answer to that one, too. Thank you."</p> <p>He nodded as my mouth closed on the head of his cock.</p> <p>"Oh yes," he grunted softly as I took his cock into my mouth. I could hear him moan as I slowly took him into my mouth. He was a very patient young man. I sucked him for a long time, sometimes as slow as he liked so that he would enjoy it. After he came he pulled back, his cock still hard.</p> <p>"Want me to take care of that for you?"</p> <p>I nodded my head as he went to my bed. I did feel a bit of guilt when I realized that the captain of the ship had no idea about my secret life.</p> <p>"Here, take this," he pushed me back down to the bed.</p> <p>He was going to fuck me right then and there. He was going to use me however he pleased and to the extent that I had no objections. He was going to ravage me with his penis. And I was sure that he would.</p> <p>I lay there with my knees up, my feet propped on the pillow of my bed. This wasn't something we did every day for fear of being discovered. I knew that I would never have any privacy with anyone, especially with anyone as bold as the captain. I knew that in order for any woman to be a woman she had to first be naked. I thought back to the night before I had to be naked, though, and recalled the incident.</p> <p>The night before was almost always very sensuous. I had come home to my house after coming home from work. The maid had come the next day, however, but I decided not to go and confront the man she worked with. I knew there would be opportunities for me to join her in the pool, but I decided not to.</p> <p>My body was already wet from sex. I was so hot that I felt like I could cum as easily as if they had been inside me. My nipples were standing out as I spread my legs wider for their use. My clitoris was rubbing against the bedspread now. I began to moan loudly as my body began to betray me. I opened my legs fully, opening myself to the two men that were going to invade me on my hands and knees.</p> <p>The two men who had just arrived had come through the door. They stopped behind me on the bed as they came to an immediate conclusion. They saw what was going on before they knew for sure what was going to happen. The only thing they could not do as they knew what to do was to go and help me. And they knew that I would enjoy this.</p> <p>I heard a low chuckle from the third man.</p> <p>"What have we got here?" he said as I turned my face and kissed him.</p> <p>I knew then that there was no escape. This is what we got into. I had been a virgin, too. My body had prepared me for all this. As my first time, I hoped the captain of the ship was still as good at this, but I never got the chance to experience him. There is not anything you can do at first to avoid the inevitable.</p> <p>My hands were roaming all over the body of these three men as they explored with their eyes. I could feel their hard cocks in their pants and in an instant I was moaning into the mouth of each of them.</p> <p>"Oh yeah," one of the men in the room exclaimed. "Is she tight?"</p> <p>"Damn, she's tight. I really love a woman with a tight cunt."</p> <p>The voice was unfamiliar. Then, the third man came over and pulled my head back by my hair. I was still standing up. He took hold of my waist and began to pull my body back as I got down on my knees in the missionary position. Our two hard cocks were rubbing against each other as he lowered my body on to his. His hands held my waist loosely with his as he began to fuck my body.</p> <p>My eyes opened a little while later and I could see the first man starting to come. He kept his pressure off my body as he thrust in and out of me at regular steady strokes. I could feel his cock rubbing against the sides of my own clit. I began to shudder. I did not know how long I had been on my knees. I opened my mouth to speak, but no words came out. The man just grunted in my mouth. I felt him.</p> <p></p> <p>"Do you do it, do it do, it," " do it" "</p> <p>"do it "do it—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
