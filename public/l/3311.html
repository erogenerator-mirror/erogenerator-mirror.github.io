English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter LI. On Passing-by.</h4><p><strong>Here we find Nietzsche confronted with his extreme opposite, with him therefore for whom he is most frequently mistaken by the unwary. “Zarathustra’s ape” he is called in the discourse.</strong> “To the best of my knowledge,” I said. “You don’t have to ask to be.”</p> <p>“I do. I want to watch. But if I don’t, you can just stop. It is perfectly natural for a lover to watch a woman have a fantastic sexual experience, and I don’t have to ask.”</p> <p>“How long will I be watching you?” He laughed.</p> <p>I got out of bed: I wanted to be able to watch him when he wanted to have an orgasm.</p> <p>I wanted to be able to see what it feels like to have a penis explode in your mouth, to hear your voice as your climax rises, and to hear your breathing as you orgasm has your vagina muscles constricting round my penis every time.</p> <p>I undressed; my penis standing erect and eager.</p> <p>“May I,” I asked.</p> <p>Yes, of course.</p> <p>I got up on my knees and sat between his legs. I opened him from the side and ran my tongue along the length of his cock. I closed my lips around the end and sucked it in. I held it out for what felt like eternity. Then I held it in my other hand.</p> <p>He pulled my head into place with his hands.</p> <p>I held his cock with my lips and sucked his cock.</p> <p>After which I sucked his balls again and again.</p> <p>He held my head with both his hands, holding and forcing my head up and down.</p> <p>The room could no longer make sense except that I am sucking on his cock and he is holding my head with his hands.</p> <p>He kept a finger on my clitoris.</p> <p>I felt as though I would come at any moment if he touched it.</p> <p>He held my head in place and pushed his penis into my mouth again.</p> <p>Suddenly he pulled out. He stood up from the bed and walked toward me. He held my hips to control himself.</p> <p>Then he said, “Wait a moment. For your own sake I will try. But for your own sake, I would like to be able to have a beautiful and sexy orgasm too.</p> <p>“I don’t understand.”</p> <p>“Don’t worry,” he said, “You will find out soon enough.”</p> <p>“Now I don’t believe we are going to masturbate each other.” I said.</p> <p>“Don’t be silly. It is a test of your abilities.” I smiled.</p> <p>“Don’t you understand?”</p> <p>“Not really. You can tell in my voice whether I am able.”</p> <p>“I understand,” he said, “But I don’t think you feel quite as good as I did.”</p> <p>“It’s a good thing you were a virgin,” I replied, “At least I hope you did.”</p> <p>I looked on and laughed.</p> <p>“No, don’t do it, but try.” I laughed along.</p> <p>He took my hand and started to lay on the bed again. I was happy to help him.</p> <p>He spread my legs and got up onto his knees, his erection pointing at my face. I opened my mouth and he pointed his penis down. My vagina was on fire. I was almost afraid to let him put his penis in me. But he made it clear that he wanted me to wait, just to see if he would ejaculate, though he made himself very clear on the way.</p> <p>Then he pushed his phallus into my vagina. He wanted nothing but to make me wait. He started thrusting into my vagina. He took my legs and pulled them over his shoulder, raising my body up towards his thrusting, now only his penis penetrating.</p> <p>It made me feel more excited than I ever have been in my life to experience it.</p> <p>I was getting the satisfaction of seeing me being fucked.</p> <p>I was looking at him in admiration.</p> <p>After a while he pulled away from my vagina and moved up on the bed next to me. He put my legs down in the usual position, his penis pointing to my vagina and his penis touching all of the walls, the inside wall of my vagina inside my vagina and my anus.</p> <p>He lifted my legs and started to caress my thighs and thighs.</p> <p>He took my legs and and to his arms and my breasts and a pillow and he said, “ I want to do you’ll, to you know what my needs. was so to, I have a woman, and and to have your beauty. I can do not want me, to—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
