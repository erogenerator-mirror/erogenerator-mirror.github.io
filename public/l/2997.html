To Consecrate, is in Scripture, to Offer, Give, or Dedicate, in pious and decent language</strong>. We all know that God was the provider of blessings. How about the Old Testament: "For I am your Father, and you are not mine, as if your father were, though this is not all that is of God." Is That Right? Do it?</p> <p>As I said, we all know as we get older that all that is of God and all that is of God is right. That is what makes God so special. I mean, he was the provider and provider of strength. How did he come to be God's partner in Life through all this time? Did he ever come to his mind, when he felt the need for God at all? He didn't. We got on with our lives together, in the way that the Old Testament is all about it. We never thought of God not as the Lord, or as God's God. Why wasn't he always being a provider of our strength? If you are raised to believe in God, there is no such thing as God's provider, that is God's God.</p> <p>That makes us each a person. We live in a world where men and women are separate. Men and women are created in sin of nature, and they have no place in God's body. Sex with men has to be an act of sin. I love a man, that is all that is. That is all that can go wrong.</p> <p>We each need someone to be a lover that will be good for our heart. Sex with women is not what we need. What we want in our marriage is not what men and women can give us. If we wanted a loving relationship, we would have sex with women. If we wanted to fuck other men, men and women will be happy to share one another with a certain degree of trust. We need people who are willing to do anything for us.</p> <p>Sex with men is fun, but it is a sin to use men, or women, for that matter. If we were to have sex with a man, it would have been for me to have sexual relations with him. That would be a sin. That would be just as fun. If we were to have sex with a man, men and women would enjoy the fun of sharing the same man's body. With the exception to not having sex with men with other women, I want you to feel my body next to yours. There will be no sex, no sex. But if we wanted to have sex with another, a woman, it would feel good too. I don't mean that in a sexual way.</p> <p>Sex with a man doesn't have to be dirty, or bad, or wrong. There is no need for sex to be dirty, or bad. You're getting laid, if you care to know, and you shouldn't feel bad because of the pleasure. Sex is dirty, bad. It is sinful, or perverted. Don't feel bad about being a perverted whore. I feel bad because he can't get enough of my pussy, even on my own. The pleasure I get from sex is not sinful because there is just me. I don't think about other men.</p> <p>There is nothing sinful in having sex with a man, or woman. We are free, like the devil in Heaven, if we find it pleasing to have sex with other men. We are free to enjoy sexual pleasures. We are free to seek pleasure, and enjoy them. When it comes to sin, we are free to enjoy sex. It is sin in the sense that all we wish to have at our disposal is pleasure. That's all that is God's desire. That is the God's desire, so that God can't deny it. It is in the sense that he can say, "My pleasure is in all that is holy." That is his desire and he will seek it out and be satisfied.</p> <p>Sex with a woman, is not sinful because you can't love her. It's not sinful because you can't have her. It's not sin because your love of her is sinful, or perverted. You are so beautiful and sexy in many ways, and you have an angelic quality about you. A lot of people, even though they aren't so much beautiful and sexy as they are attractive and desirable. It has always bothered me because I've seen your beautiful body, and I've always wanted to have sex with you. I've looked at your curves and your beauty. I've had a crush on you, and you know it. I think you're beautiful just by looking at you. I'm not disappointed. You're hot. The thought of being with you, a sexy, attractive woman, gives me a hard-on every time. I still think about you in my mind and in my body and it is the same thought about me has only that. I could be with you, with you and in our body, what is all that is a sin. It's so much more erotic, is love andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
