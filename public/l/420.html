Strands of her black hair lay round her inflamed and</strong> swollen breast and she was naked and free.</p> <p>She moved her hips and made a soft moaning noise. For a moment we simply looked at one another gazing into lust's eyes. We smiled to one another that was the smile of two people who enjoyed every moment together. "I love you," she whispered.</p> <p>"I love you too," I said as we looked deep into each others eyes. The same breath; our souls and our body's. Our souls and our souls.</p> <p>Her eyes grew more and more dilated. "Come home to kiss." Her hips moved with an agonizing rhythm. I could sense her pussy begin to ache on her clitoris. It was then that I felt her pussy begin to quiver. "Fuck me." Her words were now more forceful. I was feeling the rush. Then her hips stopped their motion. She was staring at her own face and then her eyes closed and she smiled at me with her big smile of a sister to a man who loved her.</p> <p>There was no gentleness to go with any language; it was as if they were fighting to keep the peace. I could feel her inner being quivering on the verge of bursting. My cock was getting hard but I would wait forever for her hot pussy but now I had an idea about how to do it. I began my slow and long slow thrusts.</p> <p>She moaned and groaned which caused her sweet pussy to grip my cock just right. It was a lovely feeling to have complete control of a woman but somehow it didn't feel as if I was raping her.</p> <p>She moaned the more loudly her words became more pronounced. "Harder, harder," she gasped. "Fuck me." Her hips began to rock faster and faster. Her hips began to shake. Oh. Oh. Oh. "Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck." Her eyes were still closed.</p> <p>At precisely the same moment I began my deep thrust and she moaned louder, then she began to moan more loudly. "That's it. Fuck me." Her head was still down while her breasts heaved up and down. Her mouth remained open but she didn't move much. Then when she was about to cum she did.</p> <p>"I love you," I said to her as I continued to plunge my cock as if in perfect rhythm.</p> <p>"I love you too," she said with one breath. "Fuck me. Fuck me," she whispered again more passionately. "Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck fuck fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck fuck fuck fuckfuckfuck," she screamed. Her voice sounded so loud the entire house was now filled with her words. She was moaning uncontrollably and calling my name while I was fucking her senseless.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum." Her voice was louder now.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum."</p> <p>I knew I was going to cum but she seemed to have other ideas.</p> <p>She lifted herself to look as if she were going to kiss me or at least kiss me or at least go for a good kiss. Her lips opened and she slowly moved towards me. The movement of her body caused my cock to become bigger and she got closer. The head of my cock pressed against her pussy.</p> <p>"Please wait," she said. Her voice gave her words away although she wasn't speaking to me. "Please wait a bit until I get home. I can't wait. I'm too horny to wait now."</p> <p>"I'm not finished with you," I confessed. She seemed so passionate for me that she didn't seem to care. She seemed to want me.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me," she said. "I want to feel your cock inside me."</p> <p>I didn't know if to trust her or not. I wanted her to take me at my word. I began to thrust my cock in a slow and steady rhythm which had become harder and faster. She matched my pace as she felt it coming and cried out loudly.</p> <p>"I'm getting there," I said looking in the mirror at her body and then we both gazed at each other smiling at each otherâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
