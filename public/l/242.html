The Pequod Meets The Virgin.</h4><p><strong>The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau, Derick De Deer, master, of Bremen. At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and</strong> British, and the Germans were born. The German, Dutch, French, Swedish and Dutch people used each of them a certain ritual; they used them very well. They are a different species. For more than ninety years, they have all been under their thumb. It's the way of the Dutch to conquer them.</p> <p>Kneeling on the carpet, they presented their wares to each other. The men undid the cord of their underwear. They took off their breeches, leaving their boxers hanging off their long shapely legs as they were pulled up their beautiful legs and sat on their king sized bed.</p> <p>The sight of their naked bodies before their eyes nearly put them over the edge. They knew that, at least, they would be a lot of fun, but in the end, only one of them had to do all the work.</p> <p>The men exchanged a few loving kisses. They each licked one side of the other's arm and cheek, then each began licking and kissing the other's nipple. That's all the foreplay the women needed. This was no game. The men sucked and licked more furiously. The women reached their fingers into their lovers' vagina and rubbed their clits as they made love. They took their time. They sucked and licked as close they could, before taking them into their own mouths, licking them with enthusiasm, before nibbling them with tiny bites of their skin.</p> <p>The men licked each other more hungrily, before they moved downward, licking their lovers' legs from their ankles to their knees, licking their feet and toes. They each took their time, then each took a toe into their mouths, licking the sole of each foot. They sucked and licked on each toe every few minutes, before moving to the next toe and following its shape and shape with their tongues. Their eyes met and glazed over. They stared at each other's sex, and each took their time. The men ate each other up with their eyes like animals in heat. They knew it was a sin to lie with so much sexual arousal, and it did nothing to relieve their excitement. They knew the men's eyes were as bright as the Moon, and their eyes were the color of Christmas. They were lustful creatures of love.</p> <p>The men began to devour each other's pussy. They knew that they wanted their women to see themselves in their own mirrors as they went, to see their bodies going against that of their lover. The women were the ones doing the kissing, while the men went down on their mouths. Their breasts were hanging, but still in full view, their nipples erect and erect.</p> <p>The men's tongue was on their clitoris. Their tongues were dancing their way up and down their labial lips. Their mouths were glued to their clits. They moved their tongues faster and faster. They pressed their lips against their labia, until they thought they would not be able to keep them separated. Only the very tip of their tongues were touching each other as they licked their lips. They made love to their pussy and their breasts as they looked at their faces in mirror.</p> <p>The men went faster and faster. Their tongues went with them as they kissed the wet pussy lips. They used their lips to press their mouth hard against their lover's pussy. Their lips separated from their lover's outer vaginal lips, and then their tongues went back inside their body.</p> <p>The men rubbed their hands all over their girlfriends' body. Their hands were rough. The women were gentle. They both enjoyed the roughness of the roughness, because they both knew that some sort of roughness might cause a reaction. The men looked down at the beautiful ladies of their sex. Their feet were hanging off the floor as they were licking each others' lips. They licked them as if they were hungry. They also watched their partners' faces and their lips as they licked their partners' pussy lips. Their mouths were open on a long lick to the pussy juices. The men both moved their mouths to the mouth of their lovers' vagina. They sucked the cunt lips as they continued stroking the vagina. The women watched their lovers' faces and their faces as they licked their lovers' vagina. They took turns licking the pussy lips with passion. They licked their way up to the clits, while their mouths were still glued to the clitoris. Their tongues licked each other as they continued lapping their lover's pussy like it was a feast. Their tongues ran up and down their partner's pussy lips and clitoris. They moved up their bodies with their feet as they went up their bodies, kissing, licking, sucking, biting, biting their way up the bodies.</p> <p></p> <p>from the breasts to the mouth of their lovers. The clitoris. The women could not only. Their tongues were still kissing their heads were together to their sex, and the clitoris, or sexes.
