Natásha had been staying at her brother’s with her husband and children since early autumn. Pierre had gone</strong> out shopping that day for his father’s clothes. So there had been plenty of time for fucking, but Natáasa had decided later that being fucked wasn’t going to be all that great. Pierre had asked her to marry him and to be able to have all those wonderful sex sessions in the morning before they left for the day’s activities, and after they left, she had agreed, feeling guilty that she had been so sexually deprived of the kind of sex she had grown so used to at home. But she still liked getting fucked. And if being fucked wasn’t that good, then what was the harm in having more of that sex, having plenty of sex?</p> <p>Natáasa had made a mental note to find a better man for sex than her brother, Pierre. He was still so beautiful for his age and, while she always liked him, now that she thought about it, that was what was missing. Natáasa was in love with her brother but with a different man who could be her partner just as sexually exciting. In any case, that was good enough for her.</p> <p>But then she remembered that she had been so lonely being alone during summer. She remembered the loneliness. And she remembered what she would be feeling when she got to know her lover better and to fall in love with him.</p> <p>NatÃésha was at a loss, now that she had realized what she felt about her brother. She had been so afraid she would not be able to love her own brother, but now that she had realized how lucky she could be to get him in bed, and if only her husband would be there. It was time for her to have sex with her best friend. Not to say that she wanted her best friend to be her lover, but she wished Natáasa didn’t have one.</p> <p>In any case, no one could deny that NatÃ�asa had made a great friend and that she had enjoyed the sex with her brother the same way she enjoyed her good friend. And after all, both girls were sexually frustrated by the loneliness of the summer, and having sex with other people and being alone might mean that there might be no way that they could be in love with each other but at least enjoy sex with each other, and perhaps a little while at the same time.</p> <p>But for now, at least, it was nice having sex with NatÃésha, and she liked to fantasize about her best friends husband and daughter. That, too, was nice. She would be able to do more to the two of them than they could without a lot more planning.</p> <p>But now, after having been so lonely being alone for so long, having sex with her best friend was just going to have to wait. She had been so lonely after the summer. And now that she had enjoyed so much sex and had even had lesbian sex in a romantic way with the man she loved, she had more to wish for and to wish for more and more sex with her best friend. That was how she wanted this summer to go. It was like always doing everything in progress.</p> <p>Natéha, too, was just going to have sex with her best friend. That was her first step toward making that decision.</p> <p>But now that it was really going on, she just had to do it, too, if they could make this work. Yes, they could make it work, and she had already made it happen.</p> <p>Natéha and Pierre had just made love and were kissing one another, and then Pierre was sucking on her breasts like a lollipop, sucking her nipple which was already growing hard to him.</p> <p>NatÃJoseva and Natéeha just had sex with their husband. They were just fulfilling their lesbian sexual fantasies and their own needs.</p> <p>Natéa and Natée had finally made love. They had masturbated each other with a cucumber and had kissed each other in the car while Pierre had cummed in his mouth. Then they had kissed each other again in the bathroom of their new house, and had licked each other's pussy with their fingers after Pierre had used the vibrator on her clit during their first fuck.</p> <p>After that fuck, Natéa and Natéesha had been going at each other so much that they had been able to orgasm together once more.</p> <p>Natéa and Natéesha had made love again during the day just as passionately as she had always wanted to do so. They had kissed with every kiss, the one where they looked each other in the eyes in the mirror and let each other in the same thing, and just as many times it didn’s and it was so and it was too. She smiled to make her best friends to do so long, each day. And then, but for their new and new for each other—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
