But you should leave a message for him.” she whispered in his ear. Edna giggled and whispered to her that her lover would always love her even at this moment, and she kissed him with the hottest kiss she had ever had, then she pulled him into the hallway of their rooms.</p> <p>“It’s so naughty,” Edna said to him as her hand grabbed his semi-hard cock, “I really love you too. But how do we do this?”</p> <p>Her voice was sultry, “Are you sure you like me, Edna? I’ve always wanted to fuck you. But I think we need to keep this as simple as possible.”</p> <p>But they decided that the sooner the better.</p> <p>“Please do it,” he said and pulled her down onto his mouth. The Frenchwoman had no intention of sucking his cock or even having it in her mouth. She got down to business using her hands and mouth, moving along his rigid penis, licking it, sucking it, lapping it, kissing it, licking it all over, sometimes her head would bob back and forth. Her tits bobbed up and down as she went about his cock. She even licked his balls, which she knew was a little sensitive. This time was not one of those days. His cock was big and hard and ready. Her mouth was like ice water. He was big and hard, but her pussy was tiny and ready. She thought it would be fun to fuck that big cock, just for him. But he was her lover, and she wanted it, so she took it, slowly, sucking and licking it, making him feel good and tingly that she knew it would make him feel good.</p> <p>“Oooh, you’re ready.” he said as his hand pushed her head backward, so that it was resting on her shoulder. “You look good like this, beautiful lady.”</p> <p>“Fuck me, baby,” she whispered.</p> <p>Edna pushed her pussy against his hand, and his whole hand slid smoothly inside her wet pussy, moving over her clit, and inside, his fingers rubbing over it, touching it, pushing against it. She was feeling it, and he knew she was ready. It was so nice, and she liked it, too. He knew she was ready. So he fucked her with his hand, and his mouth, moving from one breast to the other, sometimes licking the tip of her nipple, making her moan and sigh and move in his hand.</p> <p>“You are such an erotic treat,” Edna murmured into his ear. “So nice,” he whispered, “so nice. You are a beautiful sexy lady. I’m enjoying your body. I’m enjoying you.”</p> <p>She was still trying to get him to fuck her. He was getting impatient. She wanted to feel his cock inside her so much and her pussy was still burning, ready to be fucked by him.</p> <p>“I’m gonna do it. Please?” she whispered and took his cock, guiding it to her opening. He touched her clit, stroking her tender clit, moving it around, and up and down. Her pussy was ready. She was ready.</p> <p>“Are you ready, baby?” he said again. “Are you ready to be fucked, baby?” he crooned again. “Please, baby?” he murmured again, rubbing her clit over and over his thumb, and he started to move his cock in her, sliding it through her pussy, sliding it up and down the length of her, getting close to her pussy walls and up into her. Edna was moaning and moving her hips, taking his cock in her. He saw her big tits, her erect nipples, the areolas and her big tits moving all around his cock. He was stroking her clit hard, rubbing it and moving it. Her tits were moving all about his cock, and he had his hand under them, playing with her hard nipples, and he knew she was about to cum very soon.</p> <p>“Hnnnn,” she moaned, “do it! Do it now!”</p> <p>Edna was now in her body where it was not before, totally and completely her body's body that she had fantasized about, and her body was taking control of every inch of it. And, with all that he had done already, to her, he now, he was stroking her pussy, touching it, and stroking, rubbing it, moving her clit. She was fucking him, feeling the cock like a woman in her body—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
