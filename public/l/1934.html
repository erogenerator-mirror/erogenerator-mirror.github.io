Under, above, and about, are the motions of the elements; but</h4><p><strong>the motion of virtue, is none of those motions, but is somewhat more excellent and divine. Whose way (to speed and prosper in it) must be through a way, that</strong> a person, (someone) might take pleasure in... (as long as they don't mind). Then, the next part of the process of making love was to have some good, healthy orgasms. Some sort of good, nice, fulfilling, sexual pleasure. What would be better is to think about it, how long has it been since anyone had satisfied that kind of sexual need that I'd hoped for? It would be more satisfying than getting pregnant.</p> <p>A good, healthy sex is good, a happy birth experience. For now, a good, healthy sexual orgasm is a special event, one which should be given to all participants in a good life, an even more special occasion which means being well prepared to give an all-nighter.</p> <p>Now, about when I get my sexual urges in motion? Because for now, that's how I feel. And just because I don't know, but I have an abundance of them; there's a man's seed in his shaft of love. A man's love. A man-honey. That would be my secret recipe for some good, healthy sex. So, now, that is what I do.</p> <p>I start out slowly and build up my sexual arousal. It doesn't take long though before I'm moaning, "Oh, yeah. I'm doing it with an angel in heaven," (I've also learned to write out the phrase 'I'm doing it with an angel in heaven'.") Or, of course, "You've got a fine ass," or, as I sometimes like to call it, "Your eyes. They make me want to fuck you," or, "Your eyes make me want to fuck you," or, "I'm a nice ass," or, "I'm looking forward to seeing you again." But then, my love life gets very, very bad.</p> <p>As time passes though, my desires grow rather less and not more. And I can't do anything about it. My sexual libido is so strong that I feel very, very uncomfortable.</p> <p>It's not that I can't keep going, I just need to be touched, to be loved: I just don't get how strong it is when it does come to that. Like I said, I guess it's the other way around. I'd tell you to fuck. It's not easy to do, but it's easy. I'm pretty good at it.</p> <p>A good, healthy young man's sexual hunger has to be satisfied by sexual lust, not by giving a proper, healthy orgasm.</p> <p>And that means making love, yes. I'd say that. But, I've gotten used to having to go from having sex with my partner, to having to have an orgasm. It's pretty much more pleasant having to keep from having to have sex with my partner. It's not so much that I feel like a failure, a fool; it's more that I'm not really in the mood, I'm not in the mood, or in the mood to give a properly prepared and good, healthy orgasm. That's the problem with sex. Once it takes me off the hook: you're just doing it through.</p> <p>My libido gets really bad, really bad, really bad. I am horny, I can't stay that way, I need to be fucked, just fucked. It takes a lot, but eventually, it will come to me. It can be very enjoyable. It can be very enjoyable. It can be as good as good as good.</p> <p>I can do. It helps, I guess. I have to. I know that now. It really helps. There's no other way to say it, though. I know that now. I think. Maybe I still don't know what I'm supposed to do when I get sexually frustrated. Maybe I don't need to tell you what to do, it's actually easier than telling you to go fuck yourself.</p> <p>It is. Not like I need to, but just because that might be easier. I just don't feel that way, I just can't have any more of that, can't have the feeling anymore, it's just not good for a long period of time to deal with it, and the fact that it's happening, makes it easier. It's okay. It's not bad. It isn't bad. It is fun. It isn't bad. It is just better. I can't have that, can't have that any more, it's too good. I will do it, even be that way.</p> <p>After all this is done, it's up to me to have the next round of sex. I can't think of a way. I know that now, but I am struggling with it, because of course that I don't know if I'll ever get a proper sexual, good, proper, sex. I can't, sex that I'll never even more than that I willâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
