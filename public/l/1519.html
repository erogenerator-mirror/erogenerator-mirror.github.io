English by Niccolò Machiavelli </h3><h4>CHAPTER II — CONCERNING HEREDITARY PRINCIPALITIES</h4><p><strong>I will leave out all discussion on republics, inasmuch as in another place I have written of them at length, and will address myself only to principalities. In doing so</strong>, I mean it in a grand form: I will not tell about the first one that follows in order of the actual story—and I promise that that will never occur in future stories, or by the end, as I already have said. I will simply describe what each of those names does and how it happens to me.</p> <p>To paraphrase the previous point to which I am most assured, for this, shall remain simply “in” with a word. This is what I will do to this story:</p> <p>I will be with you when you fuck me; I will be always with you when you fuck me…</p> <p>This is what I expect. It will be just like in my fantasy: You fuck me, and that’s all that will be there in my fantasy. I will write it all out and enjoy it in reality—I mean, it is a fantasy and therefore only necessary for me.</p> <p>This is not the true meaning of my fantasy, I will say that. But this is the fact that I believe it to be true. That is why I feel that there has been trouble. I have only recently come to the conclusion that if I am doing this in a real life environment with my mind in a real life state it is simply the wrong place for me to do this. The reality, if you like, is that I would rather lose myself in the fantasy of some real life situation than doing it in real life and being fucked. If you want to know the truth, you will have to find the real answer to this question in your fantasies, and whether you can get it.</p> <p>I love hearing you enjoy it. I have no idea why you are so happy and why you are doing this, or that it doesn’t hurt you. It doesn’t really hurt me, since you don’t really hurt me, but it doesn’t make it hurt any less.</p> <p>I love listening to you. I have never felt that I was a real person before, though I had no idea that I was so. I had no idea that I was such a fucking “good” fuck.</p> <p>Let me continue by using the index of each word out there in this story, or where I need to use it:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>“Oh, my God, I’m gonna cum now!”</p> <p>I want all to hear of it; to be sure.</p> <p>In truth, there is no better way to be fucked than to be the receptacle of a large cock. Even if it is a man’s cock. Sometimes it feels much different than when you suck on a woman’s pussy; and some women are much more sensitive than most men are. The difference can be even magnified if you are in the midst of having an orgasm. And just as that is the truth, if you suck a lover’s cock it is the greatest pleasure you can get when you are the recipient of their love.</p> <p>It’s not so much that I want to fuck one of those “big” cocks in the ass. I don’t see why you wouldn’t if you were in the company of a man. I’m just a woman.</p> <p>But once in a while there is the matter of fucking a man if he is willing to provide it. Sometimes just watching is enough; other times just fucking one is enough.</p> <p>I know that's an awful thing to be saying to a guy, especially when the man is the source of the pleasure to you all of the time, but don’t you find me too old for him? I never felt it when I was watching you suck on one of those huge pricks before. I wanted to. I wanted it to be you that I was sucking off. But it was just your cock that was being sucked on at the moment. And besides, you were giving a man a huge cock and letting a woman suck it.</p> <p>You are giving the man that great a fucking. Just don’t let anything bad happen to it. The man that you were sucking on could be you. I don’t know if either of us was ready for that when I left the bedroom; but just having the opportunity to watch you getting fucked by one of those big cocks is an incredible turn-on. It’s the thing that every woman who likes giving a man that great a fuck will love to have. It’s the thing that men find so attractive about a woman’s breasts. They seem so much sexier in your opinion. They don’t seem to be so huge, but they seem to be so full. They’m so pretty big at the way you can suck on them. I love it.</p> <p>And to suck on what she was the man as it—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
