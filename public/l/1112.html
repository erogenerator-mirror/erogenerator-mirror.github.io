The Revolution of 1830 came to a sudden halt. As soon as a revolution has</strong> become a successful one it became a problem in its success. This means that I've made some great plans.</p> <p>*</p> <p>The time was just around the twentieth century. Technology was being made available via the Internet. When you have something that is truly revolutionary, it becomes a problem. The first thing that has to be done now is have something useful to bring into the world. You take the Internet of course, but there is no such thing as an internet of the internet.</p> <p>You must have heard of the Internet, by the way. Every device and function that seems to exist in the 21st century, was on the internet. Then there was the Internet of course, but there was also the Internet itself. The world at large is expanding fast and in many ways we can see the modern day becoming a century in the making.</p> <p>There are plenty of places where that sort of thing exists. Of course, it has become an interesting topic though. Many of my classmates use their own devices to masturbate. I was one person who did that. I can't honestly say that I didn't have the opportunity to enjoy the pleasures that came with having such an active body.</p> <p>In my high school days the only sex I had was with two women and I was never even touched by another man. Sex was only given by a couple of guys but it was pretty fun with a few other guys. I mean, it's true that it was very boring with two guys but it was only on these occasions that there was something exciting to be done with two men at the same time. In my high school days, the only thing sex was all about was getting fucked. Not just fucked; I took care of myself.</p> <p>There were also very few who were very interested in sexual matters. Some even sought to get into a marriage before they were actually married or married to a guy. To a large degree I was the exception. I just sort of got the idea and thought that it wasn't that much of a different thing than it was. One day in my senior year I attended a party at which I was invited to a friend of mine's house. I had taken the liberty of inviting two of his friends.</p> <p>I had met him already. He was a former high school wrestler. A pretty name, he was tall and slim with short brown hair and brown eyes. We were about the same height and he was much more muscular than me. We both had a little bit of an American accent to our stories of our conquests. Anyway it did not bother me as much as I thought it would. That was my excuse to be there the next day.</p> <p>So I did most the celebrating; the one with the loser of course. It was a simple and somewhat unusual place for a senior. Actually, I had only been there once when it was really interesting that one of his friends had gotten engaged to a girl while attending the party.</p> <p>By the time we reached the party it was late. The party was on a Friday evening. There were at least two couples at the party, the woman was the guest of honor and I was just the other one of the hosts. Since the room was empty it was unlikely that anyone would know that I was there. So that is how it was arranged. We weren't invited, but the person that I did meet that day was one of his friends from high school. We sat at a table and had drinks and talked about nothing and of course drank wine.</p> <p>At the end of the evening we talked about baseball, politics, life in general. Of course, we had a lot of laughs. Then there were more. There were a lot more jokes. He told me about his friend, who had become a girlfriend of his. I told him about mine. He told me about his friend, who had become the woman of my dreams. He told me about mine too. So that was it. Just the three of us sat there talking about nothing for most of the evening. I wondered who is going to get the next one of his friends so early.</p> <p>By the end of that party we were both a little tipsy and tired. We had a nice quiet night in front of a fireplace in the basement. The lights were still on downstairs so we just sat and watched the movie.</p> <p>We did not talk much of the actual movie though. It is not that we knew of much of anything on television or film. In any case we had a lot in common. We could talk about stuff like what it feels like to date a woman in my case. I really didn't really care. If I could have gotten into a relationship with someone that I loved and was all I would be dating some way outta heh anyway it would have been.</p> <p>The girl I was the woman of the man of mine. She was the man. That meant that it. As in the relationship. Just as in English—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
