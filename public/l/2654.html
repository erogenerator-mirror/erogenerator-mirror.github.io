When they took us to the most prestigious design building ever constructed in the world, it was our little secret. It's a bit like a spy thriller; only we know what the characters were all planning to do and how to exploit the unique location in which we're living.</p> <p>I've been living near Leer for well over a year and never really had any sort of purpose to what they wanted to do, but I just kept finding ways to enjoy the time I had without being told what to do or at the point of no return.</p> <p>My real name was Zazzy, a big, handsome, bright young man, a man in his mid-forties, with a nice set of balls, and a nice cock. We had been having the houseboat for a few months and decided a month at least would be appropriate for a bit of foreplay.</p> <p>"Hello, guys, welcome home! Can you come again?" Zazzy asked.</p> <p>"You betcha, you little punk, you got a sexy woman in your life, no need to worry about a little romance and sex," I replied.</p> <p>"Oh, she sure could, no reason why I shouldn't," Zazzy said.</p> <p>He and his friends went in and sat on the couch in our living room. I was still trying to wrap my head around what happened while I was still in uniform. The guys were looking down at me for several moments without saying a word. When they went and sat down they sat down and were silent. It was as though someone was keeping the action in the room.</p> <p>"What is this all about, Zazzy?" I asked.</p> <p>"Well, let me warn you and then, you heard me, " Zazzy said, as if I was the only one who didn't have his job to take care of.</p> <p>"Yeah, well, I don't know, Zazzy, but I just didn't think you'd go up there and play with us like that," I replied.</p> <p>"Don't worry, I will, " he replied.</p> <p>I couldn't quite believe what I just heard, but I also felt some sort of arousal that I couldn't put a name to. This guy, probably twenty, had a thing for some sexy, young blonde, so I had a guess that his wife was married to a young, sexy, married girl. And it was kind of sexy, as evidenced by the look her eyes occasionally dropped to the bulge in Zazzy's jeans.</p> <p>"It's because of how pretty you are," Zazzy said.</p> <p>"So, have you seen my picture now?"</p> <p>"It's not you, Zazzy, and I promise I won't take it away from you, " I said.</p> <p>The girls were sitting on the couch, sitting very close to Zazzy, although on the couch I got a good look at his cock just as it went in and out of his uniformed pants. The bulge in Zazzy's pants did not move as it usually did and was just sort of jiggly. They were not wearing any socks so I had an idea that they didn't just go in shorts either.</p> <p>Suddenly the tension in the room got stronger, as he got closer. We all were in a daze, as well as the guys. I guess our minds were clouded by lust, as we stared at the two hot girls sitting in front of us. It wasn't long before we all heard Zazzy's voice.</p> <p>"My name is Zazzy, he said.</p> <p>"Okay, Zazzy, your name right?</p> <p>"You mean, you have a picture?"</p> <p>"Yes, I do, " he said.</p> <p>"That's it?</p> <p>"It's kind of like a big smile, except I get the feeling that the girl's mouth is all over the lens."</p> <p>"I think you're right," Zazzy said.</p> <p>"Well, Zazzy, I just want to thank you for making my vacation work."</p> <p>"Your welcome, as always, " he answered with a grin, as the guys got up and moved over to sit on the couch.</p> <p>We were staring at each other with our thoughts.</p> <p>"And what can I do for you, Zazzy?"</p> <p>"Let me know," he replied.</p> <p>We all sat quietly until, at last, we heard a voice in the distance.</p> <p>"What's going on, Zazzy, " it said, "I'm coming over that way now. Why don't you wanna leave us alone?" "</p> <p>"Oh, why don't you want to tell me to join you, Zaz?"</p> <p>" I want so, Zazzy, we want so, â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
