Queen Mab.</h4><p><strong>Next morning Stubb accosted Flask. “Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man’s ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when</strong> he kicked me again, my ass was like lead candy cane, the little red dot, and so cold, so pink, so cold, so cold, so cold, in my bed, in my life, for the next seven months.”</p> <p>“Saying, like you did my birthday.”</p> <p>“I just said it as I looked at you,” I said. “I can tell by looks. Look at me,” he said, taking out his hand and placing it onto my breasts, circling his fingers over my nipples, “I can see how much you want me. Why couldn't I be with you the last time? Your dad’s gone away, I’m in Europe, and I’m home alone on spring break, a house full of empty rooms, and you’re in here somewhere,” he said, and he put his fingers into the waistband of my panties, lifting them as he tugged down my panties, until they were bunched around my ankles. “You’re so fucking sexy. I think I could stay in here all day,” he said as he pulled me to him, kissing me deeply. He pulled off my panties, and they fell to the floor, too. Our kiss was so passionate, so wild, I kissed him back eagerly, and my hands roamed all over his shoulders, neck, chest, and stomach, and I kneaded his body at the same time, one hand on his neck, the other on his shoulder, gripping him tightly, and he responded to my touch with his own.</p> <p>I stopped kissing him to stand, while we were still standing, with his arms firmly around my waist, holding me up, and I kissed him, and our mouths meshed together, and my fingertips roved all over his bare shoulders. “I’m going to fuck you,” I said, and I ran my fingers down his back.</p> <p>“You’re going to fuck yourself with it,” he said, his eyes dancing with delight, “but you’ll really want it later. Your pussy is so wet, isn’t it. You want me to fuck you, do you?”</p> <p>“Yes. My pussy’s dripping. God, your words are so sexy, so sexy,” I replied. “I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you,” I said again.</p> <p>“Then take off your skirt,” he said.</p> <p>As I did, I felt his weight against my back as we stood there, leaning together, his hands on my butt cheeks, my hands on his shoulders, and his penis straining at his flies as I pulled off my skirt. “There you go,” he said, running his fingers from my pussy to my lips, “it’ll be a long time before I fill you up with my seed,” he continued.</p> <p>“I love you,” I said.</p> <p>“I love you,” he said, still holding onto me, his fingers kneading my butt cheeks, and his penis pulsing under me, as I continued to pull his boxer pants down. I felt a bulge in his pants with each downfall, and I leaned down and wrapped one arm around his neck, the other around his waist and I slowly stroked down, to his knee, and he broke away from me and stood up in front of me, his penis standing proudly.</p> <p>“Get yourself completely naked,” he said, “I want to see you naked, too.”</p> <p>I did as he commanded, and after undressing and laying my clothes in a heap, I stood in front of him in my high heels and thong panties, my breasts, a beautiful pink areola capped by erect, pink nipples, and he stared at me appreciatively, his penis already pointing directly up at his navel as I looked at it; it was so hard and strong, and the tip was pink and swollen. I slid it across my stomach, and up my arms, over my breasts, across my stomach, then into my mouth.</p> <p>“You’re beautiful,” he purred. “I love how you blush at times like this, when you’re embarrassed by your sexual vulnerability, and that’s what I really like about you.”</p> <p>I nodded my approval, and took his penis in my lips again, his hands, my fingers stroking him, stroking him, and squeezing his skin up and down, as my mouth. I kissed the length, and down his penis, and his tip, and his balls, and sac, head and crown, and head—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
