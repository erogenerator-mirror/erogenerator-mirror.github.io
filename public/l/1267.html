The Two Prisoners</h4><p><strong>A year after Louis XVIII.’s restoration, a visit was made by the inspector-general of prisons. Dantès in his cell heard the noise of preparation,—sounds that at the depth where he</strong> could no longer make out those words: “Your life is worth less than any of you,” and the same voice of the Lord: not so with those words.</p> <p>His face was in pain and fear. The man had said. The question was now why he would not come—and where else could he go.</p> <p>The Inspector was standing at the foot of his cell, wearing his prison uniform. He smiled. “You might like to look at our men again. “ And he bent down. He spoke through clenched teeth. “Our men! They have left their country behind!”</p> <p>His guards were there!</p> <p>In that cell, the inspector took out his .38 on the boy. That was in the middle of his punishment. “You will have the chance not to be executed, if we choose you over a prisoner who has failed to serve us. We will find you.”</p> <p>“But what about your life,” I protested.</p> <p>“And for heaven’s sake, we will come to America for the last time? If you still want to live in some small town, if you are ever free of prison and become a fugitive in some prison, you will give in to us. We will come and meet you,” the guard said. Dantès nodded. He did not wait for me to sign it. He handed it in front of the Inspector—to the Inspector. “So if you do not sign the papers and give up your rights,” Dantès said, “then you may live your life, no longer with a condemned person.”</p> <p>The whole story had shaken me. I had thought. “But if all this is true, how can we go home?” I thought. Then I realized I was very weak. I still had a lot to lose. There was no escape. “Well, I guess the Inspector will go on. And no, I really do not need to speak with him. What I do need to do is go home.</p> <p>The Inspector came closer to the girl. He lifted and spread her legs, and took his penis out of his uniform trousers. “You have a beautiful pussy,” the man said. He licked his lips. “You are ready—now.” And he went between them. He put his penis inside her. His hands were on her belly. Then he put his penis against her anus. He pushed it into her. When it was completely in, he came. With long, slow movements he gave his semen so much force that it made a white-colored slime shoot into the girl’s vagina. She screamed like a child.</p> <p>The girl went into her cell, covered up as usual with paper, her pussy wide open. “We must be thorough with you in your trial,” the Inspector said, not having seen the girl leave her cell. He went closer, bent down close to her face, and took the girl’s face in his hands. “I am sorry. I can not say for myself how much you have grown out of prison, but your father has made it very clear to him how much you have changed. And I am happy for that: he has made his point, and I have no illusions. He has made his point to you. All good things must come to an end.”</p> <p>So with a last kiss, he left her cell and came back. He spoke, “But I must go home—”</p> <p>I did not go back to my cell on my first day.</p> <p>When I woke up, the whole prison was deserted. But I knew I had a little trouble. But before any of my friends came in, I thought of a friend of mine, but it was the girl who I had been doing the rape with. She was not my new friend, she was the Inspector's girl, but it was not the Inspector’s girl. The Inspector had left me with his own friends from the prison. He had been one of the ‘assignees’ of the prison. Now he was going to fuck every girl that he wanted—and I would get to fuck him. I couldn’t make this move any more than I had been. Maybe I should have said: “Not for me!” But I couldn’t give anything else to those of the prison, they would have a right to decide on what to do with me.</p> <p>After the girl had gone, I saw that the Inspector had gone to bed again: so many visitors at once for a person to a girl that she too had not been there, yet fucked him. They had been the man was all the Inspector, no more than if she had been the Inspector. I had been a servant to a—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
