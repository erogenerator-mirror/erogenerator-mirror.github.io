I, who had determined to hold myself independent of all social intercourse, and thanked my stars that, at length, I had lighted on a spot</strong> I had been thinking, and was not disappointed beyond belief. Oh, how I'd wished I had been in bed with that boy yesterday!</p> <p>As he pulled his cock from my vagina, its tip glistening with my wetness, my eyes opened wide and I caught myself looking at his face, so perfect framed by his lighted dark hair, and his handsome brow, so close to mine. God, I could taste ourselves on his chin; I felt so guilty. How could it be possible for someone to be so beautiful when he was so handsome?</p> <p>He sat up, his knees on the bed, and held his cock with one hand. "You got the first part right." He rubbed his cock over my lips, and then down into the crevice of my thighs. "It's too easy, dear. You're doing great here."</p> <p>He touched his cockhead to my clitoris. "Yes, you got the part right." He bent his knees as he pulled it back, and pressed just the swollen tip in. It was cold—in contrast to the heat coming from my vagina—and I wondered why it would be so warm, given my state of arousal. "There, there. There, there..."</p> <p>He rubbed his cockhead on my labia, and then took it between his hairy fingers and stroked it. I shuddered. He bent closer to me, and brought his face to mine. "You are so beautiful." He was inches away from me, his tongue licking my cheek. "Just like you are. You don't know a word: pretty, sexy, lovely. All those things I think about in life, but never thought I'd ever get right in bed with a boy before this, never." He ran the tip of his tongue along my upper lip, then back into my mouth. He broke off and stared at my eyes, his eyes wide and smiling. "You're beautiful," he said, his voice smooth and easy and strong.</p> <p>I smiled. "Thank you, that's so nice." I leaned into his embrace and reached around his middle for his cock—which was still hard in my hands. It felt heavy in my hands. I took it in my hand and pressed just the head against my vagina, then ran it down my slit, to circle my clitoris with my fingers, then back up again to rub on his cock.</p> <p>"I'm just waiting for a few minutes." He touched his fingertip to the tip of my clitoris. I held his cock, my fingers tight around his shaft, and turned my face from side to side. "Don't say no," I said to him, but I couldn't think of saying it, couldn't say anything, so I kissed his mouth and sucked on his tongue. He took the hint and his finger began to slide on and around my button, then into my vagina, in and out, in and out, faster and faster—I was on edge. I couldn't say a word—his words were a blur. Everything was so perfect. I could lie back with my arms around his neck and let my fingers slide up and down his chest—sometimes reaching to caress his nipples in turn, sometimes to rub on his belly as he thrust his cock into me. Our kiss got more and more passionate. "Let's get on the bed and lay down and let me fuck you."</p> <p>He moved up next to me and took my hand and brought it back to his cock. I put my hand around him and caressed it. "I think we'll do it right," I cooed. "I feel like I'm ready to cum..."</p> <p>"Yeah," he said, and moved to straddle my hips while still holding his cock. "Let's do it one more thing..." He took my hand and put it on his cock, rubbing the tip against my clit with his finger still pressed against my vaginal walls. I rubbed my hand back and forth on his cock, which was standing on its own, a long, thick, vein. When I touched his cockhead against my labia, a shudder ran through me but it did not affect me. When he pressed his cock head against the opening to my vagina, a shudder ran through me again, but still not caused by shock or shock or shock—I opened my legs. A big, tight part of it was inside and held it fast. I wrapped my legs around him; my hands cupped his balls, and my ankles and calves.</p> <p>"God, you feel so good," he said. "Your pussy feels so soft and warm and tight and so sweet and wet and tight against my cock. Yes, that's it." I could feel the full head pressing against me, then pushing into my cervix. It filled me inside. The tip against me, almost in, the back. His cockhead, pressing against the channel, inside me. It filled me.
