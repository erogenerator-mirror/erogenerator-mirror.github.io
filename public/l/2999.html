"It's nice to be wanted, desired, loved, nurtured, and even cherished." She kissed his knee. "But, it's also really nice to come home to someone who makes you feel safe and at peace. I want you here with me, and I will be happy for you and for you with me. There's nothing as beautiful as being here with someone you love."</p> <p>She kissed all around her husband's ankle and back. He looked down. "Thank you, sweetie," she said. She was naked, apart from a very tiny little blue skirt and thong. She bent down to run her tongue over his big, stiff dick.</p> <p>He looked down. She kissed the head of his prick. It started to get hard. As soon as she got his prick out and rubbed it for a minute or two, the rest of his body got tingly. He wanted her to give him full-length, then kiss him.</p> <p>He looked back down. God, he wanted her to put her mouth around that big dick of his. "That's it, sweetheart," he said. "Suck me."</p> <p>She sat on the bed, straddling, then sitting down on his dick, slowly, feeling it rub between her legs around it, before it made itself known, and then went deep inside her.</p> <p>She was smiling when she felt his hands on her head again. One holding her hair, the other going the other way. He was taking her face in both of his hands. She closed her eyes, enjoying, as he rubbed her mouth on his cock. His hands were warm. Her mouth was warm. He had his tongue on top of hers like a baby touching, touching.</p> <p>She felt his legs grow more muscular. As she began thrusting up and down on his dick, his hands were on her breasts, fingers pinching the sensitive nipples. His hands felt all around her body, her head. "Come for me, my baby," he said. She felt his cock swell. She felt him swell even more, and then come, just like he came, and she felt her own orgasm beginning.</p> <p>His hips were moving up and down. "Ahhhhh," he said. "Yeahhh!" His hands were on her ass. "Yeahh!" He was fucking her.</p> <p>As soon as her orgasm faded, she put her head down on his shoulder, and lay on top of him. He was warm to the touch, too. He wrapped his arms around her, and she felt her pussy moistening, as her insides started to spasm. They continued kissing this way, slowly moving until his dick softened enough that she could move her hips up and down with his.</p> <p>He let her. Then she pulled back, and looked at him. "So?"</p> <p>He reached up and rubbed his hands on her face. "So," he said, "are you okay with me getting you home, so we have a home together!" His voice was all business, like he didn't want to get into trouble.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she thought. She'd given him quite a blowjob, and she wasn't about to lie to him. "But, it's your home."</p> <p>"It's more like a place," he said.</p> <p>"Yeah, like a place where, if, I love you, I will love you," she said. She turned around to face him. She could feel his dick hardening again. "I will love you as I love my daughter."</p> <p>He stared at her. She felt it, saw it. "What, baby?"</p> <p>"You will love me," she said.</p> <p>"I love you," he said, as he reached over, lifted her face to his and kissed her.</p> <p>She felt her body stiffen. She kissed him back. "I love you," she whispered.</p> <p>He looked at her and sighed. "We'll do anything," she thought.</p> <p>She got off him. "Well, we'll do whatever you want us to. But, we still have a home together." He gave her a kiss. She got on the bed, and got on her stomach. He got on top of her.</p> <p>"Can we just try and do everything?" she said.</p> <p>"Sure." She moved up to him. He looked at her in the glow. "Are you sure?"</p> <p>She kissed his lips. "I'm in charge," she said. "I'll try not get sore."</p> <p>"Okay," he said.</p> <p>"It's really nice."</p> <p>he pulled down to her. He kissed at his chest. She sat her.</p> <p></p> <p>he down on her bellyâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
