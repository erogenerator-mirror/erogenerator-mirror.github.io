At the very moment when she raised her eyes from the last line of the note-book, the handsome officer passed triumphantly in</strong> front of her, and, even though her body reacted more powerfully than it had for many months, she felt the excitement of a much young man. In her mind, Cosette imagined being taken by him. His hands reached under her nightdress. He caressed her inner thighs, her knees, her ankles, her knees, and, perhaps more often, the insides of her thighs. Each touch triggered a growing heat and an awareness. Her own hands reached down and unzipped his trousers. She reached inside. His hands grasped the hemline of her nightdress and tugged it up.</p> <p>Cosette felt the hemline of her nightdress slip lower, its gentle motion caressing her thighs and belly before lowering to her navel. The cool night air tickled her skin and caused her skin to flutter and become a darker shade of paler.</p> <p>For long moments, the officer held himself on the beach, as if awaiting an opportunity to take her in the pool of liquid heat and moistness between her legs. It didn't take long before his hands were under her nightdress, caressing her legs, her legs, caressing her inner thighs. One of his hands cupped her sex, sliding over her outer labia and then pressing firmly against her moistness.</p> <p>"It doesn't feel right," she thought. "I'm so hot, and so wet ..."</p> <p>"I know," he replied. "I want to put it inside you."</p> <p>As if he could read her thoughts, his fingers moved faster, pressing hard against her sex, his knuckles rubbing the softness of her vulva until they reached her clitoris. His fingers touched the tip of the little organ, gently stroking it in her soft wetness and releasing it with a sucking sound. His hand pressed firmly against her sex, holding it firmly against her as far as she could raise it, until she felt it relax into itself.</p> <p>"It's okay," he whispered. "It's alright to touch ..."</p> <p>His breath was warm on her face. His lips pressed against hers. As soon as the kiss was forced her tongue entered their mouths, seeking entry as it had in the past. Their tongues rolled round and round, and at both ends, the tip of it brushed the lips of her cunt. They moved and rubbed against each other. Their tongues lapped at each other. Slowly, Cosette became aware her own lust was growing. Her skin became hot and tingling as her desire grew. She reached down with one hand. Her fingers ran down his chest to grasp its length. She encircled the stiff length.</p> <p>"God ..." she thought. "He's a nice guy." For a moment, no-one noticed. Then the kiss broke off, as if it had been done several times in advance. He lifted her on top of him. His hands gripped her buttocks and pulled her down onto his rampant erection. As if they had become lovers, they began their slow undulation of their own volition.</p> <p>Cosette leaned forward to kiss him. She felt her breasts hanging loosely in the darkness of her cleavage, their nipples pressing in. His arms clasped her, his hands kneaded her bottom. Cosette moaned when she felt him press his erection between her breasts, between the cleavage between her breasts and the flesh of her belly. Her lips found the mouth of his mouth. She kissed it.</p> <p>As they kissed, his hands found their own way to her bottom, and he squeezed it, feeling the firmness, the heat and the softness of her derriere. It was a beautiful, sensual, arousing motion. Her breathing was becoming ragged, shallow, ragged, and she needed nothing more than to come. Her hands ran up and down his penis, stroking and holding him. He pressed more firmly against the top of her cleavage, feeling himself hardening. As if trying to escape from himself, Cosette pulled her hips back.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" she whispered. "Stop," she pleaded. "Please ..."</p> <p>He lowered her onto her back. "Just let me..." she thought, as his hands roamed up her sides, across each buttock, then over the tops of her thighs, finally stroking the flesh of her inner thighs. She was so wet that she felt as if she was dripping with honey. "That's really nice," she said breathlessly. "I'm so horny."</p> <p>Cosette's fingers wrapped themselves in his hair, and pulled it. "My pussy's ready," she cried.</p> <p>Without any prelude to her thoughts, the officer, Cosette's lover's hand sought her outer thighs apart, and opened her thighs. With him lifting her body open, his lips closed, he stroking his fingers came into her sex was there on top of her flesh.
