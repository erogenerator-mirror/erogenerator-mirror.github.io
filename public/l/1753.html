GOOD SOULS.</h4><p><strong>Sixteen years previous to the epoch when this story takes place, one fine morning, on Quasimodo Sunday, a living creature had been deposited, after mass, in the church of Notre-Dame,</strong> in Saint Tropez.</p> <p>A fine day to screw, the author thought to himself, in order to bring back the previous day's events to the back of his mind – the best day to fuck since World War II.</p> <p>The weather was warm as the day, sunny and pleasant, on the island of Montecristo. The wind was strong today. The only sounds in the room were the sounds of the sea against the blue water of Montauk, a small harbor and the rumble of the sea gulls. Two hours ago, the author of this story had heard the sound of crashing waves in the background and a brief glimpse of a small figure floating among them.</p> <p>But this particular sound didn't come from the man on the far shore. It came from the woman.</p> <p>No, the author thought, the voice belonged in the sea. It was female. It was female. It WAS female.</p> <p>There were other sounds... a low moan. The sound was male. Male. A moan.</p> <p>The sound came from the other side of the sea, and he heard it. Female. There was a noise… a moan. It sounded like a moan.</p> <p>He paused in his masturbation. He'd given up masturbating. So he remained naked on the yacht, and he was waiting for the sound of female.</p> <p>He'd been thinking of it when he went to get a drink from the bar. It was the same kind of drink that the owner had given him, and it was a slow drink in itself, but it had brought back memories – the memories of sex with various men. And he loved women – men who were so hot. So horny. So beautiful. And there was nothing between them. But he was ready to fuck again – not just any man, but any woman. No, he reasoned, she wasn't even a woman, a woman who had just fucked him – a man. No, it wasn't fucking – it was just screwing.</p> <p>But he wanted to know more. And he was curious about her story, the character's voice, the woman in the story, and he wanted to know more about her. Now he just lay there, and he felt himself growing, becoming erect again with the memory of her name.</p> <p>And then there was her voice again.</p> <p>The voice wasn't her voice anymore. She was only there when she needed – when she wanted. Her voice was strong... she needed more, more pleasure. More sex. More intimacy between the two of them.</p> <p>No – that voice was not there anymore. There was a voice now. It was the other voice of the sea, the voice of the woman. But she wasn't the one in the sea. She was the other voice. "Where did you just go in the sea? Or do you want to go back in the sea?" he muttered, his cock twitching in his hand. He was close to cumming – close, but he wasn't going to cum yet. It might be late, but soon, soon...</p> <p>"Come now..." she cried. "Come now! Fuck you, fuck me, fuck me. Come! Now!" And she went faster. She took all of the strength of her body, both of her limbs, and the boat, back towards the island, with her legs spread apart behind her. She looked back over her shoulder at him – the same beautiful gaze that she'd had when she fucked him. In that moment, she was no longer the woman. She was the woman he'd read about in an erotic novel, his beautiful, elegant woman, the woman who wanted something more than sex from her lover... She'd become a woman, as he remembered it.</p> <p>And he was going to fuck her. He'd never been that turned on by any woman he'd known. He wondered whether she had wanted sex like that – if some of her lovers had been fucking her. And how her lover would feel about fucking the woman in the sea, and her lover herself, the woman in the sea. And how they would look, how they would feel and be. How they would be closer.</p> <p>But his cock got even harder, pulsing as his mind raced on. She couldn't make him cum, wouldn't even make the sound, because they would be out of the sea – out of sight of the sea. They wouldn't know it.</p> <p>But his dick stiffened in his hand. He thought about whether to give her something more, something more to cum with – but the thought of that image was suddenly gone.</p> <p>Just to be gone, he thought. Just to be gone, to be dead. The idea was gone. The thought, in his mind, and his cock had been left the one. he was never to do away from the thoughts. the moment, "The thought, not even the moment no longer, but the moments.
