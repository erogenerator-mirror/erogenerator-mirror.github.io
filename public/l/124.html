The Jackal</h4><p><strong>Those were drinking days, and most men drank hard. So very great is the improvement Time has brought about in such habits, that a moderate statement of the quantity of</strong> bourbon, liquor, and whiskey is to be considered a good measure for the quality and comfort of the consumption.</p> <p>While these stories are fictional here, I hope you enjoy reading about the pleasures of the alcohol, and the pleasures of lovemaking.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>I had always had a deep abiding love for sex. It was the most joyous experience of my life!</p> <p>But not like I had always believed. When I first heard about the sexual revolution in 1964...well, it was always a huge step closer to being a sex-inclusive, a social liberation...and a liberation for men and women in general. Until I met my beautiful, wonderful lover, I wasn't sure if I liked his sex-inclusive experience very much or not. I didn't. The sex I liked was a lot of different kinds of sex. It was fun, it was exciting, it was free. I didn't feel like I loved sex, but when we did it, it was a real, real good time!</p> <p>And I loved it all.</p> <p>And so did my friends, and I.</p> <p>I had friends who went to clubs and clubs every night that was open to my "fan club" (I'm sure you're gonna find your name in the news, and in other places, but never thought you would have a live sex club) but it always seemed to have me coming over for the party. And we were always able to be there, as many of my friends had, and we had the party, we brought our "friends," we even had some booze and lots of the good things. It was always fun, and it always felt good to talk. We were always having a great time.</p> <p>When my boyfriend, Jason, asked me to be his sex-in-clusive friend, I accepted his request. I felt very liberated already.</p> <p>I looked Jason up and down, then I saw that he was very handsome in the eye. His body, which made him look younger than his age, and his cock was like a real sex-inclusive man! And now he was a sexual, liberated and sexy, sexual person. We'd been together for three years.</p> <p>I felt so connected to Jason, like my body was my own, and my love for him was my own, but this was real, not just in my eyes.</p> <p>Jason's body was very beautiful, and it was a pleasure to be intimate with him.</p> <p>I had the feeling I was going to find out soon, when he invited my friend, Sarah, and I to be his friend.</p> <p>Sarah was an incredible woman. Sarah looked very much like her ex, and she reminded me of the woman I'd read about. I was going to meet her there for the birthday party, because she looked really beautiful and smart. She'd be a knockout!</p> <p>I was looking forward to seeing Sarah's beautiful body, but not as much as Jason looked forward to meeting Jason's, and certainly never had, and we'd meet for, maybe, a real live sex-inclusive experience. I was a bit of a fool!</p> <p>I felt a rush in my head, as I realized that we were going to have an actual, live sex-inclusive experience. And all of the others who'd made a sexual, sex-inclusive trip to London to see the London Symphony on the 50th of December...but it'd be so much more intense than that!</p> <p>I had an overwhelming feeling of excitement.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>Chapter Three: The Birthday Party.</p> <p>Sarah met Jason and we had a wonderful time talking, and for several minutes I couldn't even imagine life without him. We really went out of our way to get ready to party, and Jason had me bring along all of my friends.</p> <p>Sarah had made it very clear to me that this was not a happy place to spend a birthday party. She also said we were going to have a really great time if we were able to enjoy myself. And I really felt good for her to say that.</p> <p>I felt totally out of place, being so out of place.</p> <p>I felt like such a beautiful woman. I didn't have to be so glamorous. I didn't have to be a gorgeous, sexy woman. I felt beautiful. I felt so sexy.</p> <p>I thought Sarah had a wonderful sense of dress, but I was completely overwhelmed by her presence. Sarah had also made it clear she didn't approve of any of 'those' men.</p> <p>I was totally out of the loop at that point.</p> <p>Sarah's presence, and its implications, were really brought back to me.</p> <p>Sarah. I was so different.</p> <p>I was, that I wanted to get more, to experience myself, to get a</p> <p></p> <p>I, with myself.</p> <p>Iâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
