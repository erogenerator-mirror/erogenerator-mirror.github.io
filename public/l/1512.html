He built up the fire and, as soon as he saw Great Bear stirring, set off to get their horses. When</strong> they were all ready, they all went into town to stop at the local grocery so they could pick up something to eat.</p> <p>"So, how's business this year?" Bear asked as the four of them sat out at the local café.</p> <p>"It's starting to pay off," one of the women said. "We could do with looking at that TV guidebook for some more information."</p> <p>"Can you take me shopping tomorrow and see some of the stores I wanted to see?"</p> <p>The others all agreed.</p> <p>"Let's go," Bear said. "We can find something to eat while our clothes change."</p> <p>"But clothes change? It's like we still have clothes on," Little Bear thought out loud.</p> <p>"That's not what it's about," Bear assured them both.</p> <p>"Let's get rid of those things before we change too," the other one said.</p> <p>Bear walked off to change and Little Bear followed while the other women helped pick out the clothes for their new outfits.</p> <p>They came out with their new outfits shortly after nine o'clock, and Little Bear took them from the store in her store.</p> <p>"You know," Bear said after she was back in her store. "You are still the prettiest woman he's ever seen, aren't you?"</p> <p>"I'm not the most attractive woman on earth," Little Bear declared as she turned to look at the clothing on his bed. "You're the least attractive woman he's ever got!"</p> <p>The women in the store giggled and Bear laughed and Bear said, "I guess not."</p> <p>"Oh, you know," one of the women said, and Bear smiled when she put her hand on her friend's knee. "It's not about you, is it?"</p> <p>All four of the women laughed, and Little Bear said, "No! I just like being sexy!"</p> <p>Bear laughed along with them and the women asked, "Would you two ever do anything with you clothes?</p> <p>"Anything, but we could never do anything like we did with our clothes!" the other two said.</p> <p>Bear said, "We wouldn't mind."</p> <p>The others all agreed so they all got out their purchases. Bear and Bear each got two dresses and two pairs of shoes. Then they went to see what they wanted to do with it.</p> <p>The dresses looked good, and they both liked the blue silk ones, but they also liked the tan ones.</p> <p>"Okay," the others said.</p> <p>Bear was a little disappointed because of what Little Bear was wearing, but then the other women agreed.</p> <p>"I love the white ones, too," the saleswoman said as she slipped his boxers down to the bottom of his butt. "You know, it really does look good when you're nude!"</p> <p>Bear was glad because it did have something on it in case they wanted to make love to him. His cock got hard at the attention.</p> <p>"It looks pretty good in person," the saleswoman said as she held her hand out to him and said, "Why don't you show me."</p> <p>The clerk's assistant held the thin, satiny white dress up against his butt for a second and said, "I love this. It's perfect on you."</p> <p>He was a little embarrassed by the suggestion, but he wasn't about to turn around just because he was wearing a white dress like this in his store.</p> <p>"It's okay," he assured her. "I'm not embarrassed. You look very nice in that!"</p> <p>The saleswoman smiled at him and said, "Thank you."</p> <p>Bear looked down and saw a little of the red dress he had bought for his wife that year. A little of it was see-through, but he didn't care.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I looked like this," the clerk said.</p> <p>"It's okay. It looks okay if its wet," Bear lied. The saleswoman said, "I was too!"</p> <p>"Don't worry," Bear assured him. "The skirt doesn't leave the whole thing open."</p> <p>The clerk looked inside and gasped when he saw the red dress. "I never figured you for that," he said.</p> <p>"I guess I will have to wear my new bra in the store," Bear offered.</p> <p>"No, it's okay," the clerk said. "Let's give the dress to my wife."</p> <p>"Okay!" the other woman said. "I'll get my blouse for you tomorrow."</p> <p>The three other saleswomen smiled at each other and said, "We'll do that."</p> <p>Bear didn't want to wear their clothes now."</p> <p>"I want to do them" to do</p> <p></p> <p>" to be</p> <p>to do us.</p> <p></p> <p>" to do" to—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
