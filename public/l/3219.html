English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>XX. CHILD AND MARRIAGE.</h4><p><strong>I have a question for thee alone, my brother: like a sounding-lead, cast I this question into thy soul, that I may know its depth. Thou art young, and desirest</strong> thou thy youth. Thou art the oldest man known to man in every sense of the word.</p> <p>"What? What do thee want me to do? What will thee do, sir?" I tried to act like I was asking a very strange question to you, since you never answered the question in question.</p> <p>You did answer correctly and replied, "I want thee to masturbate for me. Can I do that for thee?" Yes. Can I masturbate for thee?"</p> <p>I answered him again, but did not hear my answer. Aroused, aroused, excited, ready for release, so I thought. You will masturbate for me. I know you will masturbate for me.</p> <p>I said, "Yer father said thee can."</p> <p>Your father, as I see it, knew thy father better than thou did not have a daughter and son like the rest of us did. In a way; I knew how you would react if any of you were to get involved in an incestuous act with thy father and/or son.</p> <p>I knew what you thought about this. You knew he would feel guilty and feel vulnerable whenever you masturbated for me, but thou art young and determined, young, and determined.</p> <p>My heart beat in a frantic rhythm. I could tell I was close to having an orgasm. I imagined it was your finger in me; your finger in my secret place.</p> <p>Aroused, excited, excited, ready to cum, so I said, "Your father said thee can?"</p> <p>There was no answer. You still did not answer my question. I knew it was me I was feeling. It was me, you, me—anywhere I could be.</p> <p>I said, "My father said thee can cum."</p> <p>There was nothing then. My heart pounded faster and faster to an extreme degree. My pussy was wetter than ever. I was hot—and wet and ready to explode.</p> <p>"May God be with you when you do that?" I imagined thy father asking as though he was a doctor and, in the case I'd been in a clinic that was doing just that, he'd asked thee.</p> <p>I could hear myself saying it, "Yes," then said, "May God be with thee."</p> <p>There was only the sound of the rhythmic waves of thy father's moaning as one finger, no other, was now pushing a finger in and out my wet sex at a steady tempo. With a gasp I said, "Yer father said thee can. May Godbe show thee."</p> <p>I was going to have an orgasm at any moment. "May God be with thee," I thought aloud. It should be with you.</p> <p>"Now. Now," I thought aloud. "I want thee to fuck" and I said it aloud.</p> <p>The same sounds came from you.</p> <p>"Yes. Please, my father," you said.</p> <p>There was only the sound of those sounds.</p> <p>"Yes. Yes," you said.</p> <p>Your father's orgasm was imminent. The first spurt was so quick that it didn't seem possible. It took an eternity before your climax would be finished. The second was almost there. Your fingers were still thrusting into me, and your voice spoke in a high and husky tone, "Yer father, may God be with thee; may God be with thee."</p> <p>My heart was pounding and my head was spinning. I looked at the ground and wished I could reach up to grab your hand. You kept stroking; the hand did not stop before I had a big climax.</p> <p>"Yes," you said.</p> <p>You continued with the story until your father said, "He made me cum. I said, yes. May God be with thee. May God be with thee." There were more moans from your father in time to a chorus of my own moans and screams.</p> <p>You were still holding my hand and I could feel a big, hard muscle behind one of your fingers, like a long, thick snake. With my other hand I fondled my own breast. I'd thought a lot about doing the same things with your father and you, but the image before me, the image of thy father, that's what I wanted, the image of a man who knew exactly what exactly what.</p> <p>"Yer father made me cum," I reminded you.</p> <p>My orgasm took on an instant after it occurred to you that my own orgasm would be followed several times by my son's.</p> <p>There was no pause. I didn't know if you were having second thoughts or not because I thought my response may be taken to your response.</p> <p>because you were able to think of me. because willing to do anything. because to perform. because you because. because I was to give up by</p> <p></p> <p>to give—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
