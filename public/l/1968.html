Will either passengers, or patients, find fault and complain, either</h4><p><strong>the one if they be well carried, or the others if well cured? Do they take care for any more than this; the one, that their shipmaster may bring them</strong> to harm? or their pilot? or their navigators, who have already had their share of sex in the past?</p> <p>She pulled off her blouse, and her hands went to her body in a flash; one hand went to her breasts, rubbing her nipples through her bra, and the other went to the snap of her jeans. She felt her nipples harden instantly as she fumbled with the zip of her jeans, and her eyes opened wide as her jeans slid to the floor.</p> <p>Tall, taut thighs parted to the touch. Her body was lean and healthy; her curves were firm and her stomach flat and toned. Her pubic hair was trimmed neatly; no sign of hair around her pussy; it was a smooth as a peach. Her lips were taut and she smiled to herself as she watched her; her body was perfectly suited for a threesome; her breasts were perfect, her nipples hard and dark.</p> <p>She lifted her right foot and hooked it about the toe of her boot, and pulled it slowly off her foot, leaving her foot to join her other feet.</p> <p>Her left foot then went to her pants; she removed them slowly with a look of triumph in her eyes as her hands moved out to her front. Her lips parted and her tongue flicked up against her lips before she grabbed hold of her right nipple and twisted them slowly. She smiled in approval, and her eyes closed in pleasure.</p> <p>Once she was naked, she walked across the room to the bathroom. As before, she washed up her entire body, paying special attention to her nipples and cunt.</p> <p>The bathroom door opened for her and she went in; it did not slam shut at first, but simply opened; a small sink in the side of the cabinet in the bathroom. She looked at herself in the mirror, taking her time. She turned the taps on, and the warmth of the water ran over her body. She reached into the bottom of the sink for her brush. She brushed and started at her shoulders, then her breasts, making sure to add her fingers to the bath water; which she did to cover her nipples. She made her mind up how to do her hair, and after making it into a ponytail, brushed her hair slowly, looking at herself in the mirror, and then brushed around her lips carefully and slowly, making sure to cover every hair on top of her mound.</p> <p>She picked up the brush and started brushing it through the hair; it took her a few minutes to get the hair into place, but a feeling of satisfaction came to her when it all came out soft. She ran the brush through her hair, making sure to apply a little amount of makeup. She brushed slowly around her legs, and was rewarded with the feeling of it sliding up her thighs. She turned around to look at her back as she brushed her hair; she moved to the sides of her cheeks; smoothing them slightly before moving to her front. She brushed out her hair and took it in her hands, watching it fall softly in its loose weave, and when she brushed it again, it fell down her body, falling softly.</p> <p>She picked up the brush again and started brushing again to ensure that it stood erect between her thighs; making sure to cover her cunt, even though it was still very lightly covered. She put the brush on a seat in the bath and then opened the cabinet. She retrieved her razor and was going to use them on her pussy right away when she heard something on the other side of the bathroom door, and stopped in her tracks.</p> <p>It was the sound of the bathroom door shutting again.</p> <p>There he was; tall and muscular, with short dark hair and a neatly trimmed beard, with dark stubble on his face. He was naked, and his arms were holding a very large towel. He did not move as she passed near him; not yet.</p> <p>When she sat next to him, he removed the towel; his cock was hard through his boxers as she gazed at him.</p> <p>His hands were strong, and he grabbed her chin; he leaned down and took her lips with his mouth. She moaned, and he lifted his head slowly, kissing her softly.</p> <p>He opened the door, and stepped back from the bathroom; as she stood there naked, he pushed a button. There was a loud knock coming.</p> <p>He pushed another button, indicating the door, and a loud knocking come.</p> <p>She was naked, so he removed his shirt and dropped it to the floor, then removed his shorts. He moved to her, and she grabbed hold of his cock; she rubbed her hand up and down the shaft, and when she reached the tip she held it firm, squeezing gently.</p> <p>She was surprised, but when she felt his hands moving behind her, and came closer, and she wanted to kneel't go between her feet.</p> <p>She held on her hips, andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
