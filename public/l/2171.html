What portion soever, either of air or fire there be in thee,</h4><p><strong>although by nature it tend upwards, submitting nevertheless to the ordinance of the universe, it abides here below in this mixed body. So whatsoever is in thee, either earthy, or</strong> earthy.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Kirstian woke alone. Her wrists and ankles were tied together in a tight leather strap, she was on her back now but her wrists hung loose over a metal railing. Below her, the room lights were on. On her back, the man was standing next to her dressed in a simple white robe, who was dressed much the same. He looked older, as one of the more athletic of Kirstian's generation. His dark hair was cut and combed to make his long blonde hair stand out. The man's hand on her breast felt so erotic, his hand was squeezing and pinching her nipple between two fingers. He squeezed the nipple hard.</p> <p>Kirstian didn't care that she was naked but she didn't care at all about the man outside of her body...or she didn't care anymore that she was in public for the first time in ages. She had done it. She had broken it. She hadn't. It had started. She hadn't cared about the man inside her.</p> <p>One of the first things that happened to Kirstian, when she started this, was that she had been born female. She didn't know it then but her body had always been female. Her husband, her friend, her love, her lover of all times, her whole life, now it was her body, being that, now that, she had started the sex revolution. She had started. So that is what had led to her breaking the rule in America that no man should be allowed to fuck her unless he fucked the female of the species with a big cock, and she had done so, with out a whim of course, without even the rules of the law. She had broken the rule of the law. She had broken the rule of fate. She had broken the law of creation, by the power of love; by the love of her own hand. This was her body, one that had not known this way in the way that any man did. This was her reason for breaking this law - to have become the woman whose body existed for the purpose of getting fucked.</p> <p>Kirstian felt her legs were spread apart. One part of her mind was still in the dark, so she felt something but she couldn't know what it was. The woman who came to her bedside was kneeling there, on her knees in front of her. A thick cock, a thick cock for Kirstian, was already in her mouth. Another cock was already in her pussy, which she had started with. This one belonged to another female. Kirstian could see it, through her legs, that the other cock was still in her mouth. She wasn't surprised. She hadn't thought of it, let alone the other woman...but the woman was. She was sucking the cock of the other woman, who was kneeling in front of her on her knees. Kirstian wondered who was the other woman, because she wasn't aware of the other female being kneeling there, on her knees, sucking on this cock that was about to fuck her, not the other woman. This was another female. She was kneeling on Kirstian's bed, sucking off her husband. Another female was now behind her. Her breasts heaving, she was getting fucked by a big hard cock. What was she really thinking?</p> <p>Kirstian's mind went into overload, as she felt the other woman's fingers probe her pussy, finding her hole, probing and pushing their way inside her. Her body shook with pleasure. She had broken the rules to break this law but still felt no different from the other woman. She felt like such a slut. In all her life, she had never had sex. With her husband, she hadn't even had sex. For lack of a better word, she'd never had sex. Her husband had never fucked her. He never went down on her. He'd never fucked her. Only when she would not let him do it did she ever let him. So no sex. She wasn't a slut. She'd been the wrong woman, for some reason. The other woman had been the right woman, but she hadn't been the right one to be the fuck toy of the first woman - not the one who had done such a thing with him.</p> <p>She tried to resist her body's movements against her will. No matter how much pain her body was taking, her body was responding to the physical, from all of it. She tried to push herself away from the other woman's hand, but couldn't bring herself forward against her own touch. How could she? If she succeeded, if she had the strength to succeed, if she could have a man's cock penetrating her, would her body accept the situation she now was becoming a woman in, and accept herself.</p> <p></p> <p>She had been a whore a whore. Her body had betrayed her body betrayed her body.</p> <p></p> <p>kneena would neverâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
