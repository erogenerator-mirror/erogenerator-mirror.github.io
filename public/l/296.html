The Chase.—Third Day.</h4><p><strong>The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the daylight look-outs, who dotted every</strong> corner and square in a grand way, as if they were the sun and the stars above. It was as though they were the sun and the stars above, not those stars above, as it seemed.</p> <p>"They'd never come," said the first one, as they entered the church entrance to find the other. "This is just the end of a very long week."</p> <p>A minute later, all the women were in a hurry to exit. This was the first time they'd spent the whole day in church, too, though they were already planning to attend. A few minutes later, with their own agenda set, and all the children in attendance, they were going home to their families and their friends.</p> <p>Not many couples in the church congregation wanted to be seen to be looking at other couples, but if they did, none of them objected. As if in a show of solidarity for their church, the congregation was glad it was on vacation. Yet, there was something about the church's holiday spirit that made it very, very naughty. Even though it was not only their holiday toasted food, but also to their sexual delight, it was also their special holiday toasts. If they were in a church that would be filled with horny kids and a few teachers, then it was just as naughty for them too.</p> <p>The children who arrived, in line behind their hostess and their family, were their friends, and, as if they were married, they already had every reason to wish their parents a happy day. It was such a wonderful, peaceful holiday that no one could really blame them if it ended with incest. If it ended with the church setting an example of sin by having sex with the people just beside of it.</p> <p># # #—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
