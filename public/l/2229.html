We were now on the brink, and I was already ready to fuck my cock deep into the boy's pussy.</p> <p>But we were not to cum.</p> <p>Not until the following week when our little fuck session was repeated by the next weekend. As we lay there, still naked, in the darkness, our sex was back to that delicious, sweet state of bliss, as well as the naughty feelings that had so often started to creep us away.</p> <p>I didn't want to leave his cock in, of course, but as I moved up beside him and kissed him, I had to think of things that we could do, things we wanted to do, things we would probably never do again and in the next few weeks.</p> <p>My plan to get him to take it in the ass was coming to an end now. In fact, I was not so sure of myself. When I could finally make him cum, my plan would have been to try, but once I came it would leave me nothing.</p> <p>He had obviously loved it; there was no doubt about it: I had told him how good his cock felt in my ass, and now that he was lying on my waiting cock, his hands had joined mine in caressing his balls under me, while our foreheads rested between his.</p> <p>He pulled the sheet down over us and was soon on his back and as his cock began to enter my ass hole, we started kissing each other again. I had a sudden idea to give him a blowjob again.</p> <p>I don't know why we decided to include some of the film we made to the "movie" together. It was like our life before now. We had been together for years; we were in a porn film.</p> <p>What was even more amazing, however, was that our first mutual orgasm had started immediately after we had been fucking each other for months. That was what I was to do. Or, rather, what I had to do.</p> <p>I had never had the courage to do it before. It was just sort of weird. What were we going to do?</p> <p>But then again, what else? I was going to fuck my boy, so we had to give her what she wanted. That much was obvious by now.</p> <p>"I'm sure she's waiting," I said, "but this time I'm sure she'll do it just fine too."</p> <p>I continued in this vein.</p> <p>"I want to give her something very special, you know. To do things she would never dream of, before you've even made love to her."</p> <p>"I don't know what you mean," he said.</p> <p>"Well, when I say the movies for you go straight to the action, then go slowly, OK."</p> <p>"Righty, you mean you do it in movie."</p> <p>"Good."</p> <p>"And you love it, don't you?"</p> <p>"Of course I do. What better way than to please you, in film."</p> <p>"So, you do anal."</p> <p>"Yes, and as a matter of fact, I do it too." "Well, you've said that before. So, have you ever heard of anal?"</p> <p>"I've heard only a word or two that's coming out of your mouth about it. But you've really got to try it. When I'm around, you're always too busy to go any further. It's so much more fun."</p> <p>"Okay - what have I got in mind?"</p> <p>I had another idea that I was sure would work as well. This time, instead of going straight to the action, I used some toys we had collected earlier.</p> <p>I had to keep quiet as I brought them over, so that we didn't wake the entire group from our conversation. The first of the toys was an anal buttplug. It had little beads attached to it - actually, no part of it could be called "buttplug" - and that's what I called it because it wasn't the same as the real thing. But just as before, I got my boyfriend to let me hold it against his cock. Now, my only real choice would be to hold it against his prostate, which I knew I would not.</p> <p>But somehow I persuaded him to let me do it, rather than the real thing. My plan was beginning to look pretty damn good.</p> <p>So, when we were back in the van, on my back, he was on his back, and I was straddling him. I had arranged my feet on his chest so that it was easy for me to go down to do this, and I hoped, and, so my weight on his chest. His cock was against mine, so he could move sideways. I could breathe.
