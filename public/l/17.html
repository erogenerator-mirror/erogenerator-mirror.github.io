Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy</strong> was as ignorant of sexual activity as she thought. She was about to find out that she had been wrong.</p> <p>Mrs. Wickham had always been attracted to older men. This had become an everyday occurrence in her mind since she met John Wickham several years ago. The man she often fantasized about was not any younger, but she had never once imagined any man having sex with her until now. It was the first time that she had actually known anything about sex, and despite having an affair with her neighbor's son for a short while back in the early 70's, she was more than sexually aroused by the idea of fucking her young neighbor.</p> <p>"I'm about to do it myself. My husband left me about eight months ago so I can't really start right away," she said, feeling a little apprehensive about using the word "fuck". Before she could think about it though, she asked her husband what he was doing. "Oh, nothing much," John answered. "Just my hands and my imagination."</p> <p>Elizabeth smiled at this. John was more than a little curious about the subject anyway, like many women, many men wanted some form of intimacy before he got an erection. Elizabeth found some comfort in the fact that she was very much interested in getting some physical pleasure by using her hands and imagination.</p> <p>With her husband's consent, Elizabeth slipped off her bathrobe and sat naked before the full length mirror on the bedroom wall. First she touched her hand to her breasts and imagined they were a pair of cocks while watching pornography. After a few strokes in her vagina she slipped one hand inside her panties and began pumping herself while imagining Mr. Wickham fucking her from behind. Elizabeth's fingers were soaking and her vagina felt tight and hot as she worked.</p> <p>Meanwhile, John Wickham slowly worked his rigid penis until it looked like a missile was ready to launch. Once she realized this, she dropped down onto her knees and quickly slid off his shaft to lick his testicles. John gasped at the sensation as Elizabeth ran her tongue up the entire underside of his scrotum.</p> <p>John was definitely feeling it this time. This had been the first time Elizabeth had eaten another man's genitals since they had started getting married six years earlier. His head snapped from side to side as Elizabeth licked his balls and sucked on his penis. Then she slid back up and started sucking his penis right before going back down. He was in heaven as he felt the warmth and wetness of Elizabeth's mouth and tongue working as best he could.</p> <p>John looked down to watch Elizabeth use two fingers to tease his testicles while she continued to work him with her hands and mouth. He felt the pressure building in his penis, as if it were the first time it would ever feel this good. Then it exploded, pulsing and sending a stream of warm semen into Elizabeth's mouth. Some of the semen entered her belly, some trickled inside of her vagina. She continued with her sucking and stroking even as John finished ejaculating. Finally, Elizabeth released John's penis and sat back in the chair. John was feeling a little ashamed and a little embarrassed that he had cum so quickly in the middle of the living room floor, but he figured that he had done it anyway.</p> <p>"Now it is your turn," Elizabeth joked with him. "I want to see your penis."</p> <p>Elizabeth lifted his cock to her nose and inhaled and then gave it a quick kiss. As she pulled away he could see the wet spot in the end of her nose as she looked into his eyes. Then, she got down on all fours across the room and positioned her rear end in front of John.</p> <p>"Let me get some lube," she said. "Use your hand so it is nice and slippery."</p> <p>Elizabeth squirted a large amount of lube on her hands and began stroking John Wickham's penis. Soon, the head of John's penis was at Elizabeth's nether lips. She rubbed her fingertips along his scrotum and her index finger rubbed her anus gland. Finally, she pressed her fingertip into her anus and pushed it in and out, coating it with more oil. When she felt John's penis begin to grow, she turned and sat on the arm of her chair so his penis was pointing right at her face with his glistening penis touching her cheek. With one hand still stroking his penis, she parted her lips and took the head into her hot mouth.</p> <p>John almost lost it then. Elizabeth felt like such a sexual being right now and she wanted to make love to his penis until she made him climax.</p> <p>John slowly pulled his penis out of Elizabeth's mouth, just the tip. He slowly slid his penis down Elizabeth's length with his hand as instructed. Elizabeth put as instructed then took the base in her mouth and began slowly slid back to his pubes, then, again out and then back in.
