But he was no fool, no foolish boy, but a young boy, an age to be rid of his feelings once and for all, which he took heed to.</p> <p>Siddhartha walked around the town, enjoying the sights and the sights of this time of day. This time of her life was as good for it as any she ever had. As he entered his first job-hunting mission, she had been the happiest and happiest girl in the world. She lived in a small town, in an empty apartment, a lonely life, in an empty house.</p> <p>It would soon be her own personal adventure. Perhaps, she thought, she would be there forever, a good and happy family, happy with the way they were going to be, but she feared what they would be. She would always fear it, for what it would be like to love again once again.</p> <p>She stood outside a closed building and waited as he entered the open door. She got to him and smiled, her lips soft and inviting. Her eyes danced with anticipation as she touched his face, his body. She had always had an idea of what to do and she was now ready to take it all on.</p> <p>She kissed him deeply and passionately and their arms entwined and her legs spread. She felt his mouth against her neck, his arms around her waist and she felt him moving down so he would be able to feel her body, his hands touching her. She felt his hands on her back pressing her against him, pressing the bulge in his trousers up against her.</p> <p>And then their lips touched and when they did, she felt his first kiss. She was a woman of many years now in a man's world, one who knew how to have her own way, a woman who had never felt anything as good as this, the same feeling in his kiss.</p> <p>Siddhartha was now naked. The coldness of the ground seemed to disappear under her feet as though they had been replaced by soft cushions, which she could lay her body against, feeling the touch of both their lips and bodies. She felt her toes on his shoulders and he pushed her gently down.</p> <p>"Take off your clothes," she told him.</p> <p>Siddhartha had worn a heavy white blouse for her old job, which was now nearly two years in the future. And it was a bit too heavy to hang on long enough to be sexy, so she slipped her arms through the buttons at the front of the blouse, which were rather uncomfortable under the cold air, but which she managed to get the sleeves off, as it was more comfortable for her to let her bra slide off.</p> <p>She sat down on the ground next to him and lay on her back. She didn't have to bend down to remove her panties (she loved that). The blouse was much too heavy to make any difference to any one wearing it. It made for something a bit more interesting.</p> <p>She was sitting on the cold grass, her legs spread, her feet high above the ground. She could feel an almost painful erection through her pants.</p> <p>She was feeling excited. She couldn't have imagined a more erotic experience. The man in front of her was still a young boy. She took his cock in her hand and made him lie down on her. As she got onto top of him she made him lie down on the grass and he watched as his big stiff cock came into view.</p> <p>"Put it in," she told her, "now!"</p> <p>She took it in her hand and started rubbing it along her pussy lips through her pants. Their skin made contact on the grass as she felt it slide inside. She kept rubbing it in and out.</p> <p>In a couple of seconds she got her first orgasm. The feeling of the hard cock inside her made her whole body tremble with desire. She felt her own juices dripping down her legs towards his big balls.</p> <p>She felt this orgasm coming from her own. She was the happiest she had had in so very long. She was a happy and sexy woman. She loved sex. She did not feel any difference between what she had experienced at the job interview or what she had enjoyed the previous few days. Maybe this was the best possible thing she had ever done for herself.</p> <p>That was when she saw this dark man moving closer. He was a tall black figure, with a large and very strong body. Sidsha came up behind him as he lay down on the grass. When she reached the bottom of his body, the naked black man grabbed her and kissed her on the back, his big strong hands spreading her legs wide on the way.</p> <p>un. un out a bit her lips and that she got in a kiss on her own mouth which her own hand inside- and they kissed. She got up to his face. They kissed again on her face and toâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
