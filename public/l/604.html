His feverish state and the inflammation of his bowels, which were injured,</strong> had made it easier than usual.</p> <p>The man, sitting in the car that day after another of the last flights were in Cairo, could be seen on the side, looking as his older brother. He smiled at Andrew and took his arm.</p> <p>"Where are you going, Alexander?" The prince asked when they were at the house.</p> <p>"Home, son."</p> <p>Alexander did his best to smile and hold Andrew tight but the young man looked exhausted. He took Andrew's hand and looked down at the youth.</p> <p>"We have to fly soon. We have to go back."</p> <p>"I'm fine, dad."</p> <p>"I know that, son."</p> <p>Alexander smiled in relief when the prince took Andrew's arm and led him away. The prince was a lucky father. When Alexander went back to the house he thought he'd just have to stay. He got up and started to grab something from his kitchen.</p> <p>"Here. Let me get that."</p> <p>The young man looked at the little plastic bag with a confused look on his face. He opened the bag and showed it to him. It was a tube of lubricant. Then he handed it to him.</p> <p>"Don't do anything you won't like."</p> <p>"I won't." Alexander took the tube and squirted a small amount into his hand. He began to rub a small dollop onto his penis. It wasn't hard to make in the rain because the drops only wetted the cloth.</p> <p>"Don't do anything too difficult."</p> <p>A little while later they were out in the field of BorodinÃ¿ when the car flew over a cliff that made the sky almost light.</p> <p>"We're nearly there!" The old man shouted as the car stopped in the middle of the cliff. "We just need to stand here for a few minutes."</p> <p>"Can I get the lubricant from the little bag?"</p> <p>The prince shook his head.</p> <p>"No. I can't."</p> <p>"Can't what? Take the tube inside you? I can't have that. It's dirty."</p> <p>"You just don't have to do it."</p> <p>"No. I've never touched myself in front of anyone else."</p> <p>"What makes you think it's dirty?"</p> <p>"I don't know. Some people would do that, too."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"I don't know. It's just that, even in the middle of nowhere there are people that have some kind of a fascination with how it's done. The same things that lead people to do. Most of the time they just do it, but sometimes they get a little carried away."</p> <p>"But the way the world is, it's really difficult to do it."</p> <p>"Come on, Alexander. It is our country. Let's just let it happen."</p> <p>The prince nodded and took Alexander's hand under the water. The prince was right. The old man needed lubricant because of the accident and that was the only way to do it. The prince would just have to wait until the car was out of sight. The old man took the boy's hand and guided him out through the opening with his help.</p> <p>Alexander followed his son down this rock outcrop into a small clearing in the middle of the area. It had some dirt and a small dirt covered grass area with some roots up between the earth and ground.</p> <p>"What are we doing here?" Alexander asked. The old man gave a short laugh under his breath at his own stupid question.</p> <p>"Oh, I can't imagine." The prince looked down at Alexander's naked body. "I only just got the tube out. You can do it yourself."</p> <p>When Alexander did it himself, he was surprised the old man wasn't already in the position he was in with his back to the window. It wasn't as bad as he thought it was. As he stepped up on the ledge that Alexander had been standing at, the prince put his hands on Alexander's thighs in order to spread his legs.</p> <p>"Alexander, do you mind?"</p> <p>"No, no, I don't mind." Alexander's expression changed. He leaned forward and opened his legs slightly. The prince's hands were holding his thighs open.</p> <p>"Will you do it, Alexander?" The look on Alexander's face wasn't as innocent as he wanted. "Come on," he said softly to Alexander. "Put a hand on my hip, I'll do it."</p> <p>There was no hesitation in Alexander's movements. He put a hand on the boy's hip and pulled him closer till he felt his penis press against the dirt under his belly.</p> <p></p> <p>cock.</p> <p>them. "Yes, Alexander?"</p> <p>in. The boy's.</p> <p></p> <p>skin and and felt. —</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
