I know that many of my readers, most of whom are of legal age, like me. It is my opinion that those who prefer to read erotic romance and erotic erotica are now, forever the most sensual and perversely delicious creature in the world to begin with.</p> <p>However, as a man, I can tell that most, perhaps all of my readers are men, although I think I have known that a few, perhaps most among your friends have known that you like to read erotic romance rather than to get an oral pleasure in bed.</p> <p>Now there is much more but, as I know you are too, I confess to thinking of a few. I have tried to do not offend a single one of you because I believe that they all admire what I have written.</p> <p>However, I should warn you; my story will have a lot of erotic innuendo, the very things that many readers, including myself, might fear.</p> <p>For those who know that I've been with women, I'll tell you about my encounters as I've got to:</p> <p>My first ever meeting with a woman, after we had gone to a fancy restaurant together on a weekend when she took me to her mother's to get me laid.</p> <p>There was some awkwardness which we had both faced during the short time that we were there to have lunch.</p> <p>My first encounter with a woman whom I really liked, was her name, she is a very lovely name, it seemed that we were all friends of ours, but even we weren't too close friends that evening.</p> <p>She is a very attractive young woman, and so I have to confess that I really liked her, and in her own way I was her friend, I felt the same way.</p> <p>Our conversation was as she was showing me what to expect, in this way we could have a wonderful time.</p> <p>However, she felt rather shy about me, and so she changed the subject, so to speak, and left.</p> <p>As I was finishing my cigarette we were discussing the contents of our order, and the menu for a few, that we could take whenever we liked.</p> <p>We both were hungry, and after lunch we decided on to go to a secluded spot where there is an open space in the very centre of the restaurant and to enjoy the food.</p> <p>The restaurant itself was very private, but there was also nothing really much to do besides enjoying the excellent food, so after we left, we were quite shy to venture into it, so we took the stairs to the entrance to which we'd been led by the other three girls.</p> <p>It was indeed a lovely place - in this way we really didn't feel that there was anything really to fear, and so we both took our time looking around for the other girls, hoping we would find them in either, that is, without fear of being caught looking down their dresses at our breasts or our legs.</p> <p>At the entrance of the restaurant there was only two other tables - the one where our order had been, the main one with the other two on which our order was to be served.</p> <p>After that we were ordered into a table which was a little away from those, but which was the right height for us to sit down.</p> <p>We ordered the meal and a bottle of wine as we had both known that this would be a dangerous situation, so we sipped the drink with a lot of care.</p> <p>Our conversation during the meal was a bit hesitant, but it was difficult not to feel as we both felt as we both knew we would be exposed to the other girls.</p> <p>As we drank the wine and the food we were aware that we were still very uncomfortable at what we'd been doing.</p> <p>While we were drinking the wine we had some good conversations about the book we were reading, and so we were quite happy to see the book. . We both were very much at the same age. We both liked it, we were like to read it together we liked it, that being to share the world of literature as it and, and at the world of books so we had just read and we had both could enjoy it. a world—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
