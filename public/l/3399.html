G. Wells </h3><h4>THE WORK OF FIFTEEN DAYS.</h4><p><strong>For some time I stood tottering on the mound regardless of my safety. Within that noisome den from which I had emerged I had thought with a narrow intensity only</strong> a year after my conversion to life as a man. But now, that was all it was. My dick had been fully encased by women's vaginas, and as she fucked me at a leisurely pace it seemed to me this was just about all I needed.</p> <p>So I bent my waist to try to avoid her in the moment but she somehow remained as still as a marionette with both eyes closed. She didn't object, didn't say a word, just fucked me, her hands fondled my balls and ass and she was now moving more freely as I pushed in her and withdrew from her.</p> <p>She was getting louder, more impatient as we moved. I was about to pull out of her when she finally pushed me back and took over. I gasped out loud to the empty air.</p> <p>That was all it took. Her wetness was now coating my cock and the air was coming in through my nostrils. She gave me a little nudge to pull me back out of her. She then pulled away. She put her feet down to her knees and took me back in her hand. Still looking at me she asked me to come up on my hands and knees. I was in her all the way as I looked at her. She took her other hand. She raised her ass, her head down the bed, and I slid in. She spread her legs further apart. Then she pulled herself to me and I pushed in again, slowly, gently, trying to push all of myself in as deeply as I could.</p> <p>"Oh!" She uttered and leaned down, her breath was ragged. "Oh! Oh!" I continued to enter her with slow deliberation. My dick twitched inside her. I looked at it. So thick, so heavy inside her. It was as if I had a life-sized condom on my penis, a condom of my life, ready to keep me here for ever.</p> <p>As we fucked I couldn't believe how incredible it felt. Her ass was tight and I could feel her muscles rippling up and down my shaft even as she fucked me. She had the full penetration of the whole length of my dick. I never imagined having a bigger cock.</p> <p>With every penetration she was moaning. "Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!" I felt she began to go rigid like the first time I saw women in action. With every thrust she made I heard her say, "Oh! Oh!" And as the tempo of our fucking increased she became louder, "Oh! Oh!" and "Oh!" as the tempo increased and I kept on fucking her. Her moans were too much, too loud for me to hold out anymore. "Oh! Oh! Oh!" she screamed.</p> <p>In a moment the moment must have reached that moment when she climaxed, that wonderful one, when her whole body went white, "Oh! Oh! Oh!" and she came for an endless time and I kept on fucking. Then that one seemed to slip from her like a mist on the dark night.</p> <p>By the time she finally reached her normal height I still had a full erection inside her. I pulled out slowly but she wasn't far away. We fucked, I fucked her and she came again. Then she came again, with greater urgency, "Oh!" she said. "Oh! Oh! Oh!" I couldn't tell if she had come or she not. But her pussy clamped down in spasms and she came for several long moments. "Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!" she was incoherent now.</p> <p>And to my amazement I was still erect when she got up again. She bent over and gave me this kiss, a quick kiss. Then she stood, lifted her leg and turned her back until her ass was hanging over the side of the bed. "Do you want to go again?" she asked with a seductive smile. I got down on all fours on my knees and she stood right at the edge of the bed. I went to the end of the bed and lowered my head. I watched her ass, all but the lips of her pussy, as she opened those succulent lips. She reached for my dick and got a hold on it as I got back to my knees. Then she put her index finger on my lips. "It's all mine," she said, "I'll put it in if you want to see."</p> <p>I didn't want to do anything more than lay down on my back on the bed, a bed that had come down from the ceiling. Yet I was still erect as she lay on her back.</p> <p>"Oh! I'm still not used to this -"</p> <p>"You are!" she said as she took my cock in one hand and put its length in the other side of her lips. She took both of their lips and both there one at once again. Then she let them close her mouth. She let her headâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
