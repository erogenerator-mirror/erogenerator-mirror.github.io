I am feeling slightly silly, but perhaps not my husband's favourite.</p> <p>I will not be wearing a costume I hope. I have dressed myself in a pair of very short skirts, with a rather wide-legged top which hangs round me nicely. It makes me look quite normal but my top is of very good quality, not as tarty as my skirt but enough to make people, and those who may fancy the person, notice me without a second's thought, be as sure as possible. No panties and no bra, not even panties. A plain white cardigan in which to button one side as one hand fondles, and quite obviously no bra is enough to do the job for these people.</p> <p>No, I don't have a skirt or a top, just my top.</p> <p>I was feeling a little strange, so I wore a white cardigan which is rather see-through, so that others can see my breasts being bare above the top. As I said, it is very comfortable but I had bought it only a week or so in advance, without revealing the truth of my state of undress, which is my desire to look like a proper woman if that was what it pleased people.</p> <p>And then, what happened? The lights came on and I realised that I was naked. My husband was there, he was taking me home.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, but you can't take your top off. I can not take it off!"</p> <p>"Oh, it's OK!"</p> <p>"I'll take it off, will you, I have some things I want to try."</p> <p>"Do you like your top off?"</p> <p>And that is just what it was.</p> <p>"No!"</p> <p>"Why not?"</p> <p>"I think it is very dirty to be such a tease. I shouldn't have let you wear your top like that. You look nice."</p> <p>So I unbuttoned my cardigan and it fell open, revealing my bare breasts and the smoothness of a bare skin on a smooth flesh.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't... it's not right, I shouldn't..."</p> <p>"Please! Don't worry. I'll get it out, you must try it on."</p> <p>"No, no! It's very dirty to be like that!"</p> <p>Then I was feeling very sexy. No, it's not very sexy, but I was feeling sexy, and feeling very sexy.</p> <p>"Oh, that feels nice! No, no please don't stop, you have to try it."</p> <p>"Do you have a bra, I can find one."</p> <p>"Yes, and yours is too."</p> <p>I tried on the cardigan and it was really so easy. No problem. It is just as easy to remove as it is to get rid of it. A bra, I was wearing in particular, and the cardigan fell open a little, showing my bare breasts and the smoothness of my skin, so that even my nipples were standing on end.</p> <p>"It's so nice to feel sexy!"</p> <p>"I think it is a nice feeling, too. Just let it hang on the skirt."</p> <p>"But it's all in the card!"</p> <p>"It's easy to pull down on the skirt, just let its skirt fall round me."</p> <p>This was very fun. I had to take off the cardigan. I'm not going to wear a shirt to get under the skirt, but I was feeling very sexy.</p> <p>"I can't take it off, it's too much, you want to go and change."</p> <p>"No, I must go."</p> <p>Not even thinking, I did have my top on again, but not on the whole time. It is a simple change which would get my husband, though. He had told me he will do that, on the short side of my skirt, not the long or tight.</p> <p>"No, please, I can't, I couldn't go like that!"</p> <p>"I don't need you to change!"</p> <p>"Just don't."</p> <p>I must, but I can't, surely.</p> <p>Please don't."</p> <p>He still not but that I would</p> <p>pleaseâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
