How hast thou carried thyself hitherto towards the Gods? towards</h4><p><strong>thy parents? towards thy brethren? towards thy wife? towards thy children? towards thy masters? thy foster-fathers? thy friends? thy domestics? thy servants? Is it so with thee, that hitherto thou</strong> have forsaken thy own ways, and have now forsaken thy own heart and soul? Have they not been broken in by thy own deeds, by thy own deeds, is in fact such a sin as the one you have made. But these are your own faults. Have such a sin as, hath it, taken from thee thy own body, with you own soul, to your own self."</p> <p>With his other hand, He began to touch the sides of her face, first with his fingers and then with his palms. Leashe smiled. "May we?"</p> <p>He leaned forward and kissed her lips. The first kiss was almost tender, but the passion was a great passion, a great passion, that, by itself, was a great passion. As he kissed his wife, he began to take off his clothes. Leashe felt like a child, out of her bed. He was the young priest, and she had no love left to share with him.</p> <p>She looked into his eyes with a lusty desire, almost as if to beg him to take her again, yet this was her own lust, a desire for him, a need for him. He moved, and as he stood, he placed his clothes right into the closet. He took her hand, and led her to the bed. He lay back on the bed and she sat beside him, on top of him. She kissed him, on his lips and chin. He closed his eyes, and moaned. She took his dick in her hand, and rolled it over her face. "Let me lick it, my love," she said. "Let me suck your dick."</p> <p>He smiled at her. "All right, all right..." he kissed her and rolled onto his back. She straddled his hard member, and he pressed his pelvis upwards to meet her mouth. Her pussy was warm and moist, and she moaned when he felt her hot wet tongue touch him. They made love, she riding his dick, he on top of her, he taking her. And as he held her breast, she moaned his name in the night.</p> <p>"Dance!" she cried.</p> <p>He stood, and Leashe fell. She was on his belly now, bent over his lap. He kissed her neck, then moved lower, to her firm breasts. He rubbed his fingers over them. He felt her back arch and her moans get louder. He kissed a small bruise there, then sucked them into his mouth. His cock was aching, with arousal, and he did not care about such. Leashe moans turned to moans, and he knew she was close.</p> <p>"Don't forget," he whispered. "Let's forget--just take me."</p> <p>He rolled her over, grabbed her ankles, and pushed her legs apart. He then pressed his dick in and began to move it in slow long strokes, his head going in and out of her. His dick could go only up to his balls in her sopping love canal, and now he wanted her as deeply in her as possible.</p> <p>"Cum all over my dick," he whispered. "Let me make you cum when I want to."</p> <p></p> <p>He kissed her again and then pushed her back on his dick. He slid it in and out, in and out, as if he was going to fuck her forever. Then he took off his clothes, and she lay on her front. He entered her slowly, and she cried out. "Take me, baby." he said to her. "Take me in yourself...all of me..." he went back to fuck her, and she put her hands on his stomach as he pounded her. She looked at the ceiling of her bedroom and stared up at her lover as he fucked her. As she was watching him, he came. He kept on pounding, and she came again. He felt her body tighten and knew she was getting close.</p> <p>"I won't last much longer," he said.</p> <p>"Yes, yes," she cried out. "I want you to cum in me, now!"</p> <p>And he was in her. He began to kiss his way up her body again, his dick going up and down in her pussy. He could feel her juices on his dick. And he wanted to cum in her again.</p> <p>He took her hands on his dick, and put them onto her breasts as he pounded her. He grabbed her breasts, they were nice, full, firm, with no sag, only the firmness of their softness, and her small nipples. She pulled and squeezed them, and it was wonderful.</p> <p>"I want to kiss you now," he said to her.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"Do it now."</p> <p></p> <p>He kissed her. "do it now</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"You kiss me</p> <p>kiss it l "lâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
