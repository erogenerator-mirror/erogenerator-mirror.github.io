English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>XLI. THE SOOTHSAYER.</h4><p><strong>“-And I saw a great sadness come over mankind. The best turned weary of their works. A doctrine appeared, a faith ran beside it: ‘All is empty, all is alike,</strong> and all is yours.' We all want to understand, I say, but, I don’t mean to offend. ”I didn’t mean to be vulgar, maybe. But, just a little, I have no more words!</p> <p>You will find that I am talking about the Lord God, “I’m going to destroy you,” I say. Perhaps it will be easier if I keep my mouth shut.</p> <p>You are going to be with me, you say, “I cannot make you happy. I cannot make you happy. I have to make you happy—”</p> <p>Let me take the blame for all these thoughts and memories. You don’t have to be in love and loving for just any reason. Your life is all yours. I’m your pastor.</p> <p>— ——————</p> <p>I was a young pastor and I was just young enough to be your pastor. I didn’t have to be a young man to have an answer to your prayer. I had, in high school, been married—“I will marry and live life as if it were normal for me to be going to church,” I said in your prayer.”</p> <p>All the men and women I prayed to were all men—all the good men and women were all men. None of you had to be a man to go to God.</p> <p>I looked at all the women in my life. I looked at all the girls you probably had sex with. I looked at all the beautiful women you did—and I looked at all the women who had sex with you in the same way. You were just like all the other men and women who did this, “God bless the Lord”.</p> <p>It had been six weeks since you said, “I can’t give you anything. All you have to do is ask.” I told you that was exactly the way it was and we could still be doing this all seven years of the rest of our lives.</p> <p>“I want you to try something else. I am really attracted to you. Have your sex with me—like we did. I want to ask for my permission to give my permission to give you,” I said.</p> <p>“It never happened before,” I said.” And I want it to never happen again.”</p> <p>I know I was blushing. I tried to look away or to pretend I had never seen the man and a woman before. Then I looked at you. I watched as your eyes grew wide.</p> <p>“I want to go to church,” I said. “I don’t want to stand around watching the men, the women and children of this country as they suffer from sexual torment. I want to find a way to please God as I please you.”</p> <p>You looked like my pastor's prayer book because you were blushing.</p> <p>“I want to have sex with you once. I want to tell you the truth.”</p> <p>“What?” You asked, shocked.</p> <p>“I… uh, well, I was in Africa,” you said. “I was in a convent,” you said in a panic.</p> <p>Now, I was confused, too. This wasn’t the most flattering thing I had ever heard. Then I stopped. I was embarrassed.</p> <p>“I, I don’t know what to say,” I said.</p> <p>I thought for a moment. I could have said, “I’m sorry. I was in the convent. I can’t—“</p> <p>Suddenly…</p> <p>I pulled you down onto the floor and my hands were on your legs. I had never touched a woman but I wanted to and I did. I rubbed you hard. And when your legs spread apart, I knew you wanted me to touch you.</p> <p>In my mind I pictured you doing this, doing this to yourself, as men do. You wanted me to do that for you. You wanted me to do this. I saw you, watching as I teased your legs apart.</p> <p>Now I wanted to see you getting what you came for. I could feel a rush of warmth spreading through my belly and into my groin. I wondered if any of the men I prayed to had ever felt that way, before.</p> <p>I ran my palm down your leg. My hand reached up to your bare pussy and then moved under your skirt. I didn’t realize you were wearing panties.</p> <p></p> <p>it. I must be thinking that you wore panties, I was feeling it. I was touching it.</p> <p>. Your pussy where you. Your slit.</p> <p>I wanted, your clit what you in my mouth.
