English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>LXXI. THE GREETING.</h4><p><strong>It was late in the afternoon only when Zarathustra, after long useless searching and strolling about, again came home to his cave. When, however, he stood over against it, not</strong> one foot from where he stood. He could smell her; the musky perfume of a woman who has been intimate with him since the day before. He could taste her...his touch could be felt there, as though her flesh was, to him. His eyes dappled over a face of beauty. He could also see how her skin, pale as ivory now, was covered with the glistening black of her eyes. Her eyes were a deep green, the same color as their surrounding, but still deeper than those of an animal. Even in her eyes it was evident that she could do things with him without looking.</p> <p>Zarathustra pulled a face as he stepped into the shower, turning it on, to wash away the dirt and mud of a day's playtime. Her touch felt...warm, but unlike a woman's caress. Zarathustra had been with other women already, so it was a shock when she touched him on his most private of openings. His eyes became wide and he stared at the floor, as though the floor itself was her domain. Zarathustra was not aware that she had brought him here, into her lair. The water stopped and Zarathustra grabbed the shower curtain.</p> <p>"This is where you can wash away this shit you did when all of this shit was at your level."</p> <p>"What?" Zarathustra was almost on the verge of tears.</p> <p>"I don't think I'm sorry you did what you did, you idiot," Zarathustra's tone was mocking. "I was looking at you, naked, on your bed, and when all of that happened you fucked. I have a point though. I got a fucking idea of what happened. Look, maybe we can do better. Is that what you want?"</p> <p>"No!" Zarathustras face was now an angry crimson.</p> <p>"It's not what you think," Zarathustra continued. "You have all this. You have all of that. And you're not going to fuck anybody else, right?"</p> <p>A look of anger and disgust came to the corner of Zarathustras' eye. "You want to fuck me without using this shower, then? Is that why you wanted me to clean up those dirty stains where you fucked me?"</p> <p>"Well, yes," Zarathustra spat out. "But what you are implying is a bit more, isn't it? And you really need to think about that."</p> <p>"No, no, I can't do that. It's not like it is for you. I mean, I know it will be better for you when you can see me without all this shit I just put up on a bed to wipe away that shitty stain on my bed."</p> <p>"But I don't..." Zarathustras' words trailed off. "I can't...ah."</p> <p>"Do you know what I'm asking, Zarathustras?"</p> <p>"No...I don't know."</p> <p>"Look, I don't want you to get your shit. Ever. You have to do all of these work," Zarathustras said. "Just remember that, or we'll be fucking for a while. You need to get your shit together."</p> <p>"Is everything all right, then?"</p> <p>"Just remember that you are not going anywhere." The water stopped, the curtain was pulled back, and Zarathustras was no longer in the shower with him.</p> <p>"You're not getting out of that! How am I going to explain to my husband that sex is not all that good. How am I going to explain how I'm going to explain that I have fucked you? How am I going to convince him that fucking is not all that good for his ego? This is something, Zarathustras; you're not changing. Not this time. And, really, you shouldn't be fucking anybody else without using this shower."</p> <p>"But it will be better for everyone," he whispered. "Everyone."</p> <p>"Right. Right. Then we'll clean ourselves up. So...let's do this."</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>Zarathustra finished his shower and stood naked in the living room, staring at himself on the couch. The last thing he expected was to be looking at his wife after what he had shared with others already. However, there was nothing but the glow of love and friendship shining back from the face of love. There was something different in the intensity of Zarathustras' eye as he watched her. It was a deeper look he hadn't seen in his wife of such intense love but that of an instant sadness.</p> <p>"If you don't mind not have something else to wear this..." He says, I'll go and get dressed," she whispered. "After your clothes and bring these clothes we'll be getting dressed weâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
