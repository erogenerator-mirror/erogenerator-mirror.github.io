She was soon convinced that it</strong> had to be a special someone to have a moment to confess his love for her. Her eyes had to adjust to the light, but she soon became comfortable with the sight of him standing against his desk and her standing there naked as he studied her.</p> <p>Emma could feel the wetness between her legs. She could feel his eyes burning into her and he was taking his time scanning her body. She knew it was going to happen. He took his time, taking in every inch, every curve. The minute with him was making her feel so safe and cherished. He stopped at her sex with his mouth. Emma was so turned on by the scene that there was nothing left to the imagination. Without a doubt, it had always been a favorite memory of his.</p> <p>Her breathing became uneven and her thighs tightened against his hairless lips as she felt her body growing heavier with anticipation. It started to happen, it moved in her body like a speeding motor. She was so sensitive by the time her second orgasm overtook her. Emma was not the only one of the young men, she had been on the receiving end of many orgasms while her husband had been inside her. The young men didn't realize it, but as they watched her, they didn't mind giving her pleasure to the fullest.</p> <p>Emma turned around and bent over. Her wet sex touched the warm surface of a large desk top. Emma stood behind him now and positioned herself in a sixty-nine position where he had started a long time ago. As they both worked feverishly on their mutual need, Emma felt another orgasm approaching. He began to lick her and she loved it, but she couldn't take it any more. She pulled him away and pushed him to the side. She took her sweet time kissing her husband as she got dressed again. With no underwear, Emma stood in front of him naked from the waist up. Emma didn't care how small and insignificant she was anymore. Her husband was a handsome man. If she had been able to turn around and walk away, Emma'd have jumped his bones. But instead, she did something she never dreamed she was capable of. She didn't.</p> <p>Emma ran her hand through his hair, pulling him towards her. He was not sure how long Emma had done this before he realized that he should go and ask her how she was feeling. His wife was so innocent, so pure. Emma's touch felt so soft that it took a moment for him to focus on her face. Emma ran both of her hands through his hair and her eyes closed, enjoying the sensation.</p> <p>Emma leaned closer to him so that her breasts were touching his shoulder. She rubbed her breasts with her right hand and continued to kiss him passionately while letting her left hand explore his body. She felt him responding and she was thankful. She didn't know whether she should do this. To give him pleasure, but she couldn't do that. She reached down and felt her husband's testicles, which were almost swollen, and found them covered by a large pair of testicles. She grabbed his cock and slowly rubbed her fingers on it. He was still holding her to him when she felt his tongue on her breasts. He licked and nibbled her breasts without actually kissing them, but his mouth felt amazing. In fact, he started to suck on both of her boobs at the same time. He sucked her harder than anyone had sucked her breasts before.</p> <p>The stimulation on her breasts and mouth made Emma forget about everything else except the sweet loving sensations she was feeling. Emma felt the warmth from the young man rubbing her. She was getting closer to another orgasm so easily, but she decided she needed much more. Without releasing her to him, Emma quickly moved over the desk to sit on her husband's lap.</p> <p>Emma's body moved at a quick pace. She was aching to feel her husband inside of her. The first time was so perfect. Emma was so wet and ready that she knew it would be so much more satisfying to do this than to take something that felt like that. She needed her husband's body. There was no turning back now. She needed to feel him as she felt him when he fucked her. It was like she wasn't going to stop until she finally got her orgasm. Emma needed to be filled and be filled like she never had been. She needed his cock inside her without missing a beat. This was her greatest dream and now, there was no turning back. Emma needed to get her husband inside of her again, to be with him forever.</p> <p>Emma leaned down and took her husband's cock in her mouth. She wanted to give him as much pleasure as possible. However, it wasn't long any longer. Emma stopped because a moment. Emma lifted her legs were tired from supporting her and spread, Emma started to the desk. Emma's legs were lifted. Emma's legs were held Emma. Emma's legs were held Emma were held Emma heldâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
