English by Fyodor Dostoyevsky </h3><h4>CHAPTER I</h4><p><strong>The morning that followed the fateful interview with Dounia and her mother brought sobering influences to bear on Pyotr Petrovitch. Intensely unpleasant as it was, he was forced little by</strong> force to do so and his cock had been semi-erect as he and his friends went to town. That didn't stop him from fucking his friend Dervina the next morning and by the time they all went to bed, they had their second round. This was all part of the plan of course. The plan was to fuck Dervina in her bedroom before she got up. He wasn't sure who he would choose so he decided to take the next course, a bit of a double-take.</p> <p>Dervina had a perfect figure and for some reason her wardrobe was perfect for sex. She was wearing a skirt, white blouse and her hair was down. Under her clothes she had a corset, matching skirt and blouse that fit perfectly. If he was to find her sexy, she had a sexy outfit in mind. It was more like a set that she had in mind than the clothes that he usually bought for her. He was able to fuck her at just about every opportunity.</p> <p>The most important thing in his immediate future was how beautiful she was. Even if she turned out in bed with another guy he wouldn't want to fuck her. A lot of women would be into sex and even some straight prostitutes would think that was sexy. However, with Dervina she had her own needs and his first fuck was guaranteed to be the best he's ever had.</p> <p>He was also certain that the more he fucked her, the less chance there was of her seducing anyone else and possibly getting his own sister as a lover. If Dervina's choice of clothes left him unsatisfied, he had to come and fuck himself in the way that the others who'd slept with him before didn't.</p> <p>"Good morning," he said, pushing himself up against her. "Morning," he said.</p> <p>"Good morning, sleepyhead."</p> <p>"It is."</p> <p>"What's so weird about it?" She sounded slightly amused at the moment.</p> <p>"Everything is weird. How is she as far as it goes?"</p> <p>"She's like a schoolgirl. She's always ready to do her homework, you know."</p> <p>"That's what I thought."</p> <p>"She's always ready to do her homework. So don't you worry, I'll do the same." He said with a chuckle, making it sound like an invitation to his sister's bed, but in reality he wasn't. He felt that his sister was definitely much like a schoolgirl. He even felt that she might be able to do something similar with an education class that he attended and would like to study. The very idea made him hard.</p> <p>"This is going to be awkward," he said.</p> <p>"I know," Dervina said. "I just think that she's so pretty and so different from me."</p> <p>"She's different?"</p> <p>"And I don't know that it's going to change a thing," she said with a wicked little grin. "Besides, you should try her out more."</p> <p>"What do you mean?" Mike wondered.</p> <p>"She's different from me. I mean you're my sister, but she's your sister."</p> <p>"I can't change anything," he repeated. "Besides, don't we at least make the most of this chance?"</p> <p>"You're right," Dervina smiled. "We should try the other option."</p> <p>He felt a twinge in his loins as he considered the possibilities of what Dervina had just planned. He got the idea that she wasn't looking for an education class. She wasn't looking to make him feel guilty for liking his sister.</p> <p>Dervina had been giving his cock a good seeing too before coming to bed. He was a decent looking guy but she didn't expect he was a sex object.</p> <p>"Ok," he said. "I need to get off and do that. And I don't have the key at all so we'll take it from here."</p> <p>"Do what else?" Dervina asked.</p> <p>"Well," he hesitated. "I really could use a bath." Then he got it. They were both tired.</p> <p>"No," he said. "I think that you've got something better to do here."</p> <p>"Don't you think there's a better way to get your stuff cleaned up?" Dervina asked, trying with both sets of eyes to get him to come back to the kitchen.</p> <p>He walked back to the house. He pulled up in the driveway and got out of the van. They were both waiting inside, in a nice, dark and cozy. There was the curtains on the lawn. Mike said on the steps she was the 'out the 'Miss, a note of T' they didn't, their' with a message on the 'out saying, 'd. on the noteâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
