Mr Power stepped in after him, curving his height with care. —Come on, Simon.</strong> Do it. I'm in the mood for a little fun.</p> <p>"Hang on. There's a first time to get that."</p> <p>"You want this bad boy here, isn't that right Martin?"</p> <p>"Yes — and maybe it's that good," Simon nodded his head. He leaned against the wall for support, feeling himself lift up onto his toes as the carriage turned towards the next street. It was a dangerous position to be in, but something, any thing, did it. Martin was just a big lad, big-tittied and lanky and all, and Martin did. He could have made trouble for himself, but he wanted this to end.</p> <p>"And maybe it'll be nice to you Martin," Martin murmured. "You get so much attention because you're a big lad? Why don't you stop taking your clothes off while you're driving?"</p> <p>"Because I can't do this with your clothes off."</p> <p>"We're in the right location."</p> <p>Martin hesitated. He was standing next to a young woman dressed in a red velvet negligee (with a huge gold bow) with high-heeled shoes.   "Would that really be such a bad thing. After all, you're going to have to do this every week?"</p> <p>"Wouldn't it be bad if you had to get naked with me?" The blonde asked, turning back to the car. Her long, lanky hair was piled up high on her head.</p> <p>"The sexiest bit is that you didn't have any clothes on, and I have no idea what the hell that must have been. The look on your face, on this young woman, like I was there last week, I'm going to fuck you up," Martin chuckled.</p> <p>"Ah, that's not what me and your friend said."</p> <p>"So what?" Martin asked impatiently. He was ready to get involved now and he couldn't wait any longer, as much as he wanted to be.</p> <p>The young woman, dressed in the negligee, reached her hands inside the negligee and pulled down her panties down. She lifted her hips up to her feet and stepped out of them, leaving a pile of sexy black stockings on the floor. Then she held up her skirt, turned around, and lifted the top of her negligee. The blonde, who'd been watching from the carriage, had now slid off her panties.</p> <p>"We'll see. Take off your clothes, then. And get a look at that tight, round arse of yours," Martin said, and leaned down.</p> <p>The young woman bent over to pick up her panties, then wriggled them down her thighs. The stockings pulled tight over the white cheeks of her ass, her pussy peeking between her legs.</p> <p>As a man, the sight of the young woman's bum caused an erection to grow and grow. He could smell the sexy and earthy scent of her sex wafted sensually from between her legs. And he knew that he was going to have some fun with this sexy older woman.</p> <p>And so it continued…</p> <p>***</p> <p>Martin turned the key, and the carriage sped through its journey to the end of the Avenue de Mer. The door closed. Martin and Simon reached the end of the road, and the carriage turned into a dark corridor. Martin and Simon walked to the end, and he saw several doors lined up in the middle.</p> <p>"Okay," he said, "go for it guys."</p> <p>Martin and Simon both reached into the wardrobe, pulling out shoes and a briefcase. They followed their lead, pulling open the draw and getting out their shoes, as well as jackets, shoes, and jackets, from the pile of clothing on the floor.</p> <p>"Here we are," said Martin.</p> <p>"Oh really?" said Simon. "And what's your choice of clothing?"</p> <p>And they walked to the door of the store, then walked to a room down one. Simon unlocked the door, pulling the heavy case on the floor inside. "What's mine in there? Oh yeah," Martin said, "and one more thing too. I think maybe we ought to put this down for a while." Simon held up his shoe box. "A really nice pair, these ones."</p> <p>'Fuck me,' thought Martin, as he opened the case and extracted what looked like a sexy black satin black bra and black silk thong.</p> <p>"And what's mine?" Simon continued.</p> <p>The pair returned to the room and sat down on the bed to find the sexy garment wearing just the lingerie of the top and was wearing her panties. They sat on the bed.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>'The pair of shoes opened the bed, to which they did their clothing was quite an open briefcases.
