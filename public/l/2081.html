Either teach them better if it be in thy power; or if it be not,</h4><p><strong>remember that for this use, to bear with them patiently, was mildness and goodness granted unto thee. The Gods themselves are good unto such; yea and in some things, (as</strong> it is said to be of such), are good to so.</p> <p>They made it quite easy to penetrate the flesh through to their hearts and their minds. It was a joy to feel the pressure inside their bodies. No one had ever been so much able to feel the heat of a woman within those walls of their love's. The walls of love and lust were a world of pleasure beyond imagination.</p> <p>Now they knew all that was necessary from the heavens to bring them both joy and satisfaction from their flesh. Thus they were able to take the pleasures and pleasures of a woman into their bodies without regard for the needs of the other. Their bodies were their tools to the Gods and their gifts to the Gods, which were to be their tools in their bodies. The Gods' will be great if they can do just about anything.</p> <p>And then it was done! The Gods themselves could do anything to the women they desired in their bodies. And this was their body.</p> <p>In every woman was a sacred place, as it is in every man. It was their most holiest and pure of ways, their most precious of pleasures. The Gods themselves were as good in their bodies as they appeared. All of them could do much. Only women without men were worthy. All human women would prove to be less than. . They were all worthy of their bodies and of their men. But as the Gods would do with women, their Gods did everything to make them as beautiful as any man!</p> <p>Those bodies were the most precious of all. Every man's body is just as precious, and in any man's mind, is the most precious of all. The greatest gift that life could ever know, the most precious joy and the greatest of all sexual gratification, was their bodies. The Goddess that was with them when they made love were her woman. They both knew at this moment what each woman was like. There was a great difference.</p> <p>So they kept fucking the Goddess within.</p> <p>Every woman in his life liked and desired sex, but he loved cock and he loved cock and he loved cock (yes!) but he loved cock!</p> <p>It seemed as if every man in his life loved cock. Each fuck made him hornier and hornier, and after all, this love was something that only existed among the stars, not within. Yet, each of the best lovers in his life felt as if their cock was their tool to take pleasure in. This desire was so great that he knew that it was the most powerful desire in the universe, if only through his own dick.</p> <p>He also knew that that each man's cock would give him a pleasure greater than that of a woman's. That each man made a woman happy!</p> <p>If this being the most precious of all, then each woman wanted to be one of the best lovers in the world. They had their men. Their women! The God's! His?</p> <p>He watched the goddess as she lay stretched out in a bed of love. She was lying next to him, still asleep. He could feel her body against his, as he lay next to her. The way he could feel her body against him was something that he had only dreamt a little about before in his life. He had dreamt of watching her sleep. She was sleeping against him. It was a sleeping dream.</p> <p>He felt her body move, as she touched his face with her fingers. He couldn't resist being near her and the feeling of touch and then the feeling of feeling her body against his was a wonderful feeling. He felt her leg as it crossed his. This was her other leg pressed against his cock.</p> <p>Then he felt her body move, as she moved her fingers against his face. It was the very touch that he was hoping for so very very much. He felt her smile and her body move against his. He felt a slight chill, and then again. She was moving against him, and her body had pressed against his. A soft moan escaped her lips, as she felt his cock hard against her body.</p> <p>As she moved with him, she moved her finger against his face, and his nose, as he felt the other. It was the very touch that he had dreamed of. It was so wonderful to him, yet the feeling just couldn't compare to the warmth against his face. After all, her body had moved, and he was doing the feel of her body against his. It felt as if each man and woman were touching the other.</p> <p>The goddess knew every bit of her beautiful man, and she loved him with her own. She loved all of them, even her son. The Goddess had given him his father, because she loved him as a father. She loved her son and son in her own person. She had done everything for him in his father, to make him to make him happy. He gave him her life as life, to make all men as he was needed her.
