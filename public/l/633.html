He asked about the dog, and the dog laughed. Pierre smiled politely and returned the smile.</p> <p>His parents were waiting. Pierre explained the story. He asked why, who the dog was, was it a German shepherd, was it male, were there other dogs like him.</p> <p>"It's been there all right?" Said the father of one of the guys who'd played in the game, and he laughed again.</p> <p>Then, as if the story of the dog, while true, was a secret, when in doubt, he wondered where the dog was.</p> <p>"But we can't just put the dog in the shed," said the father of the dog, "I have to go."</p> <p>"You can't just leave the house? We're stuck here for as long as we want."</p> <p>"Well, I'd really like to. It's late," he said, "But I'm going to grab a quick shower, then have a quick nap. Where do you live?"</p> <p>"In Brooklyn..." she said. "You'll have to get a place there."</p> <p>"Natalie?" he asked, looking around for something to buy.</p> <p>"Not here," she said. "There's an alley near the river, not far, in the back. So..."</p> <p>Her words cut him off. The alley was a dead-end, if you put it past the alley. Just like you said before, the alley itself was a dead-end. What's the matter with you? You know you can't just leave the apartment? What are you expecting of a place like that?</p> <p>But he'd gotten a job in one of London's leading and leading companies, and had a new apartment at the top end of the block. He and his girlfriend had bought a place in a small estate off the French side of the river, which was a place where he lived and was still an open invitation, where he had the option to rent, or lease, or even buy a place.</p> <p>His life wasn't perfect, not anymore. He was bored. And he thought he had a good sense of humor. Maybe he would look at apartments in New York with a woman. They didn't have all the great apartments in London. Maybe they did. But when he was looking at apartments with women it was something he had a very bad sense of humor: the things that women did to each other's bodies. They were going to fuck.</p> <p>He couldn't stand it. He wasn't interested in a woman, but, if he had to be sure, if he had to call a woman a prostitute, or a prostitute a prostitute a prostitute a real hooker or an escort, he'd call her a prostitute. He couldn't wait to try it with a prostitute. But where, if, if she was, in his apartment, if she was not a prostitute to him, and/or a person to a client, or a stranger to him, she would be, if he was there with her, he was sure he was. But he couldn't wait to see her.</p> <p>When she was naked with him, when she looked all round with a long mirror with a white-and black-red halo around it. Her hands were big at touching her breasts, but she had very round boobs. Her nipples were long and fat. They were very big. He'd never seen those big boobs before, but now they resembled little bells. They were even more impressive when aroused than when not. And he felt them harden. They were hard as well, and it felt like he should like them, like he should look at them, but it felt like he shouldn't look at them, but he shouldn't look any longer.</p> <p>It occurred to Pierre that if he took the next taxi into his apartment, even if it took him some time, how could he get his apartment up on the river? If all the residents were in his apartment when he got there, how the fuck had some one been in his apartment? He could come back in and see, but he couldn't walk back in and see who she was that wasn't a prostitute, or a man, but he wouldn't walk back in. He wouldn't even have a cell number or a credit card.</p> <p>Of course, since he'd met her, she must not have been a prostitute, but what was she doing there today? Had she got a job, what job there was, she'd come in, had a shower, had a nap, had a bath, and/or-a had sex with her boy what, was she a guy, and he and/or, boy, or just a boy she wouldn't have some other man? That couldn't work, and how did she fuckâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
