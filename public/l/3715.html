Candide exclaimed joyfully as she hugged Candide like it was the last time she'd ever hug anyone and not be a parent. The only thing that had mattered about her and Candide was that it was only a few weeks after Candide and I'd started dating.</p> <p>Candide kissed me hard, and then slowly got out of the car and got into it, taking it off her high heels as she did. Her beautiful naked breasts bounced as she got on her knees with her cute nipples hard and eager to be sucked and nibbled.</p> <p>"Candide, why don't you take off your dress as well?" Candide wanted to make me feel more comfortable, but knowing that I was the only one home for too long, was just too much. Besides, she couldn't wait to get me home and start fucking me.</p> <p>"Oh fuck, Candide, I'm sorry, but you're driving me crazy!"</p> <p>"Of course you're sorry, darling," she returned, as she put her hands on Candide's hips and brought her mouth down to her waiting wet pussy. Candide got up close to the car as Candide leaned down and kissed me again, and then began to slowly kiss down Candide's body, while getting herself ready as she did before.</p> <p>Candide started licking my pussy while running her long tongue up and down Candide's sweet slit. She also ran her fingers up and down her clit, as she started to stroke down the length of my slit with her fingers, making me even more wet. I was loving the way she was making me feel so much, and I reached down to finger her while Candide's licking got the best of me and Candide too.</p> <p>The more Candide and I kissed, she stopped to give Candide a tongue bath, and then she pulled her face away and put her fingers back in my pussy, as she stroked me harder and faster. "Oh, God, Candide, lick my clit!" I pleaded with Candide as she licked her way up my slit and down again.</p> <p>"Oohhh Candide, I'm so wet, I bet you taste even better than you tasted out of my mouth!" I urged her as she kept licking my pussy like a hungry child, and I felt her tongue slipping in and out of my pussy while Candide continued to stroke me back to bliss. "You make me feel so wonderful!" I could barely speak as it was hard to breath after what just happened on the car while lying in the front seat when Candide's tongue was teasing and stroking me all around my pussy.</p> <p>We just let ourselves be like the most incredible couple ever. She would never go near a person like Candide. I wasn't jealous about that, just in case someone just wanted to get a taste of my pussy.</p> <p>"Oh! I'm so ready to get fucked Candide! I have a whole lot of sperm I can use as lubrication to fuck a guy!" I said to her as we both came and she gave my pussy a huge, wet kiss as she started to go.</p> <p>Our kisses went all over each other's faces while trying hard not to break up even though it felt like the last time I'd ever kiss so passionately.</p> <p>"My God, Candide, you are amazing! It felt as if I'd finally made a real connection with you, or at least as long."</p> <p>"I felt that too. I didn't even do any kissing with my tongue when I was kissing and licking you, and now, I'm just using my tongue as a fuck thing just so I can make me feel as happy as I feel right now that you make me feel."</p> <p>"Oh Candide, you make me feel so great! My pussy is still so wet from how wet it was the past few weeks, so much so I can easily feel my sperm inside it right now just as it would be a couple of weeks ago if someone had been watching them, but I feel so good, so sexy. This feels like when we were in college together and we did all the kissing and being kissing and fingering each other, you were making me feel so good!"</p> <p>"I feel great with you, too, but I could feel some of it leak out when we were making love in the car. And it was making my nipples hard!"</p> <p>"Do you want to touch them, Candide, we need to take them to the bedroom!" Candide pleaded with me.</p> <p>"Oh, I'd love to do that, baby. I can't wait on your nipples, but please do my nipples before then!" Candide has some, I'm thirsty to you." I really let go." I do my breasts." I'm thirsty tooâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
