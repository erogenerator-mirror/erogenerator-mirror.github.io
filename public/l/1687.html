It made her laugh to think of Desiree with a baby. Why, it</strong> was the most wonderful thing that could ever happen to a person. How it might have been wonderful to be happy with the baby. It could've been glorious for the mother to raise the child she loved with all those people looking out for her. It could've been beautiful, perhaps most beautiful thing that anyone could ever do to her. Yes, it was amazing. Now it was about fucking. It was about fucking hard and fast.</p> <p>She sat there, still nude, looking out the window for hours, not paying attention as people passed by.</p> <p>Desiree had told her that she was going to have the baby of her own free will and that she was going to get into her personal life.</p> <p>In her spare time she fantasized about what it would be like for her to fuck someone else and feel the pleasure of being with another woman.</p> <p>Desiree had never considered herself a lesbian nor was she quite sure what she had in mind if that were ever the case. She was just trying to get that fantasy alive and for fun.</p> <p>When Desiree left for the office and walked through the reception area they both smiled as they heard the sound of her car pulling into the garage. Desiree went over to the door and opened it to let all of it to go in. Upon hearing the car door open she had thought that she was going to have a huge orgasm there to the sound of the door opening. Of course, she got carried away in the excitement for who was coming in. After all, the door was opened by who.</p> <p>Desiree was still standing there, completely naked. And naked and all of it was wet in some cases as she saw the black body, all of which fit perfectly into the room. Her panties were on the ground, soaking her panties. She wasn't used to being this much wet in public but all of the little things made her have to admit that the wetness did make her feel beautiful. Desiree had no such reservations at all now. She put her arms around him and they began to kiss.</p> <p>Desiree began to feel hot and excited. She could hardly wait to feel their bodies touching. They'd have the chance to do more than hold each other in their arms, kiss and sometimes even a little tickle. They'd have a chance to really be naked in public.</p> <p>With each kiss, kiss and touch of his tongue inside her mouth and then the warmth of his hand on her body, she felt her body responding with excitement. She put up little resistance as they explored each others mouths with their tongues.</p> <p>Desiree's body felt like it was on fire, as he began to run a finger along her lips and between them. She knew how to control her desires on those who felt what she did.</p> <p>Desiree felt a tingling in her pussy as he continued to slide his finger along her pussy. He had taken his finger out of her mouth and was working it along her lips down to her clit. His finger slid lightly down her slit to the opening of her labia and then back up to her clit. He was so gentle and gentle with her. Desiree was not only enjoying everything that he was doing to her but was loving every second of it. She pushed her crotch against her fingers, wanting to be touched even more.</p> <p>She felt so good to be touched in her pussy. Even though she was trying very hard to enjoy it as much as she could. She was still so wet. The wetness of the room, his finger on her clit and it felt so good to have it out and into the open. She liked every bit of it.</p> <p>Desiree could feel him moving his finger back and forth at her clit, causing her body to move. She felt every single nerve inside her body being connected to his every movement. She loved it. It made her feel so much at home, so very good to feel what she wanted and what she needed.</p> <p>Desiree knew that this was the signal of the baby of her life and soon enough they were going to have the child.</p> <p>She spread her legs even wider to give him more access and soon enough as her hand reached for the baby's breast she found his mouth.</p> <p>"Oh, baby!" she heard him cry as his lips, tongue and fingers massaged her nipple. He knew what she liked to do and she loved to play with him and to make him squirm with pleasure. She loved what he could do to her. He was doing amazing things to her with his mouth and fingers.</p> <p>Desiree took in what he was doing and her body responded immediately to what he was doing to her. She began rubbing his head, neck, back and her neck and.</p> <p></p> <p>Desiree loved the texture of his mouth. It felt so sexy and was so sexy, so arousing his hair and his head—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
