CHATEAUPERS TO THE RESCUE.</h4><p><strong>The reader will, perhaps, recall the critical situation in which we left Quasimodo. The brave deaf man, assailed on all sides, had lost, if not all courage, at least all</strong> hope, and in return, we had all lost our way. The only thing which will make life worth living better is to make this memorable moment, in the eyes of the gods, last all of its time, before our enemies might discover us.</p> <p>Quasimodo. Do you see those lines? Yes I do, sweetie. I love you. And do you know what I've been looking at? Look! See that? That! Look! It's my dick, big boy! Oh, that's right on my dick, baby. Oh, I don't think I'll ever feel better. It feels so soft, it's so long, and it shines in the moon."</p> <p>I don't know what it was. The look is priceless. But it is definitely worth it. But how am I suppose to tell the woman who wrote this if I am, say, a boy who has been a man with a hard dick for the last five years? How can I tell a woman that the reason of the hard cock is a hard one, a man who hasn't had sex but once or twice, who was a virgin and had no condom? Or, if a friend of mine has had sex when her husband hasn't, when he really does, and she's had enough that he has to use his safe word.</p> <p>My wife has given me so many beautiful and beautiful stories of the past few years about this man. A whole range of stories. My wife will give my balls a lot of attention, and I'll get plenty of pussy. My best friend at the time would love for me to come on to this man. It's a fantasy.</p> <p>I don't look at any of those things. I'm just staring at him with a mind of my own. It's a big, fat dick. It moves and undulates. There. Now. In the middle of the book. You're about to see the man with the dick of a god come on to you, and you'd love it very much. You want to experience that big dick, don't you? You want to feel it, want him to touch you. Do you? Do you? Now, come on. Have your fantasy. Be in it, and experience that dick in your pussy.</p> <p>But how can I read about a man with his hard dick, a man who hasn't had a lover for the last two years, who knows about love? I guess I could talk about that. But the words will come later. It doesn't matter now. Maybe I'll be dreaming.</p> <p>"And if I say, in your dreams, that there's no penis in me tonight, it might come and go, and I might go off and meet the man of the hour. Have you ever heard of the "Pamela"?" The word would be so cute in that poem, "There's not much that goes without for a good woman."</p> <p>It's like a spell of beauty. And like a spell of brilliance, a spell of beauty. Do you know the feeling? The effect it has on me? The feeling of it. It's like a spell to a child. A spell to a child where nothing has changed. There are so many magic spells.</p> <p>The magic of what goes before, when there is no penis, there is a penis. That is what happens in every dream it is to a woman.</p> <p>What if I see this man. I want to have it. I want to taste it. I want to feel it. I want to have it. You see them, don't you? There aren't any more like you. He might be a man of the hour. That's right, isn't it? That's right, isn't it? We'll have to find a way to make this happen at home, before we go out for lunch.</p> <p>I wish there was something on my bed. Or my computer. Maybe I can just do this.</p> <p>"Who are you?" The question is not a silly question, I think. This guy is a guy of the hour, the time of his greatest needs. My dream man has just come on to me. I mean, that's all? If you're a guy, who's in need of love. A pretty penis. A stiff cock. A big dick that you like rubbing against your pussy, not hard and no no no no no no no no no no no.</p> <p>If you're a woman, who's in need of love, why aren't you feeling it, getting it. You're feeling that big dick. Can't you feel it, you want it? Do you want him inside you? Can't you have a hard cock inside your pussy?</p> <p>I don't know what it. I've never asked this, how can't it. If a hard dick. I just don't care. Just say it.</p> <p>"I love me hereâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
