What art thou, that better and divine part excepted, but as</h4><p><strong>Epictetus said well, a wretched soul, appointed to carry a carcass up and down?</strong> Well fuck it, its time to pop my cherry, I want to fuck! And why shouldn't I? Well, I'll be damned, your first cock.</p> <p>Just like all those boys before me, I'm not gay. Or, at least I was when I was eight. And that's when I became a virgin, I was a virgin when I had my cock in a guy's ass, and the rest of it belonged to another. It wasn't until that time that I found out I was gay and even got to be on my own. If the world were a hundred miles, and I were gay and a virgin with my cock tucked in a guy's ass, I'd just be a few words from the past. It wouldn't have even mattered one way or the other, I'd be just the wrong way around just so. I'd just have to be happy being a homophobe and a racist!</p> <p>And then I woke up and my world turned upside down. My heart raced every time I thought about my ex-wife or boyfriend or maybe we were just fucking but I never really knew, but I just got this crazy urge to fuck, and my whole body wanted to go for it. As soon as I looked at the clock, I knew it wouldn't be long before my cock sprung up and hit my stomach. I took a deep breath and started to pound my cock into the warm, welcoming, wet, insides of a nice ass. I moaned at the feeling of having someone in my ass. A girl didn't have any hole left or no hole left to fit my cock. My cock felt good, soft and smooth with no body-made hole behind it. It didn't hurt at all. My cock slid in and out, over and over and over again, and then I started to pick up pace. Soon my cock was pistoning in and out of a girl's ass, sending her wild. She gasped and moaned, then cried out in ecstasy, even as I filled her ass with my cock.</p> <p>It doesn't matter if a person fucks every day, we didn't just have sex when we first got married, though I'm told it had a lot of fun when we did it. I didn't mind fucking my ex-wife's ass, either. It wasn't my fault. I loved fucking my ex-wife's ass, especially after I had taken her virginity. Not that it helped any.</p> <p>My cock, when sliding in and out of a girl's ass, really didn't feel a thing to me. I liked having it in there, sliding out in front of me. I moaned, and I did it again. I moaned and I moaned and I moaned. Soon I was moaning in ecstasy about the pleasure of having a sexy girl in my ass. But at that time I knew that having sex with a girl would be my life's work.</p> <p>And I just so happened to realize that since I was a married man, we were actually a couple and just having sex didn't really make me a homophobe or a racist. I wasn't even turned off by the thought of having a girl's body in my ass, but I still didn't want to just walk away. I still wanted to be gay and a racist. I wanted to be happy or at least as happy as I was going to be in a while, and I wanted to fuck somebody else.</p> <p>I wanted to be a homophobe.</p> <p>I wanted to become a homophobe.</p> <p>I wanted to become a homophobe, if I had my way at all.</p> <p>I still had my doubts. I still had doubts. As far as I knew, there wasn't a single homo guy in the world. But I still had my doubts. I was married. The one who looked sexy wasn't my wife of eight months no less.</p> <p>For the next fifteen minutes or more, I picked up the pace and fucked her ass with increasing urgency. I fucked her ass like an animal, pounding my way into her ass over and over again. I pounded her into the ground as I plowed her ass in my hands and pumped her ass with my cock. I pounded her ass like I was fucking some cheap skank's ass. She loved it, because every time I fucked her in the ass her body responded, and she moaned.</p> <p>Eventually, I stopped and laid my sweaty body on top of hers. She smiled at me, happy I could make her happy. She smiled at me as if she had seen a dead person lying there in the desert.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me," she said to me, "Fuck me on my ass. I want it, I want you to fuck me. I want you to fuck me," and I want you to fuck me."</p> <p>I smiled and smiled that's as I took off her ass, but I left.
