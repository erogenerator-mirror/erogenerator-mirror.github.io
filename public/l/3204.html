English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>V. JOYS AND PASSIONS.</h4><p><strong>My brother, when thou hast a virtue, and it is thine own virtue, thou hast it in common with no one. To be sure, thou wouldst call it by name</strong>, because thy father hath a name which may be called thee upon thy knees.'</p> <p>If it were not, all in due course, I would not be here doing this, standing where I was.</p> <p>The sound of those words echoed like the melody of a song in which the music is now more familiar than it was when the man who was performing the song was performing his own.</p> <p>For he was so familiar, that my heart seemed to just pound out of my chest. And then he did this. He began again.</p> <p>This man, who had already had sex with three other men, was fucking my brother like mad. He was fucking my brother!</p> <p>Now, the man who had been dancing was fucking my brother.</p> <p>"I'm coming," I said to the man who was now driving his penis into my brother's anus. "Come on, brother. Come for me," I said. "Give your brother what he needs."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>He began to move very fast. And I felt his hands on my hips. Then he began to move very slowly. I felt myself falling backwards onto the bed next to him. Then he was on top of me. And I felt him entering me.</p> <p>I felt him come inside me. Then, he began to fuck me again. The other three guys were fucking him, too. I could hear them talking. Saying what they had thought about me, how they wished they had known me once.</p> <p>"Come in, brother, give it to me," I said to him. "All of it."</p> <p>But, I'd always hated this. I despised being forced to be a whore for them. My husband never wanted to fuck me on a bed and then leave me on a kitchen table. And now, he came like I never had—and they were going to fuck my brother.</p> <p>It was the most erotic and lewd experience of my life. My husband and his friends had just fucked me! How could I possibly not want to be fucked by my husband's friends? And more importantly, had my husband known about this? Oh, oh, well, I suppose that was a one-time thing—it was, after all, my marriage.</p> <p>But, still, I had to admit to myself that it was something else. It had become part of my life from the beginning. I knew that I had to find a way to deal with it. I had to know what it was, not just what it was, but what it felt. Who was my husband? Did he love me? Did my husband love me?</p> <p>"Fuck it, brother," I said to the man who was raping me. "Do it. Do it on the bed."</p> <p>To be continued...if this is so fascinating—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
