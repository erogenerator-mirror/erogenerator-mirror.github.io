But he wasn't able to wait much longer, his cock had been too much too soon. He was glad she didn't object to his absence. The day she had decided to bring up the idea of being fucked by his cock, had been the day it began. The thought of being fucked by him had never even occurred to him. He was certain he would never fuck her again. But, the idea of the two of them fucking each other brought a great thrill, and he began to fuck her.</p> <p>His cock had quickly become a permanent fixture inside her pussy. The more she fucked him, the more he became. The thought of her pussy and his cock fucking each other so often, filled with the thought that he would never fuck her again. He had never fucked her as hard. He had never sucked her pussy too hard. And, if he hadn't had such a strong desire for her so, that day, she definitely would have told him it was too soon.</p> <p>This was such a wonderful discovery to awaken from. To discover if what they had both been waiting for, both of them to experience, both of them were now so happy about it.</p> <p>The day they had both decided to talk would go on. But first, they had to discuss how much they both enjoyed it the way they had been. She knew that's what he had been hoping for. He said she had been very considerate, considerate with him. She wondered who he had been hoping for. He had to explain to her how much he loved it when it happened. And, that, it had indeed done. He had said she had been such a good hostess. And, he had said she had been wonderful. She had made herself quite comfortable to his need. His desire to be so good to her overcame all thoughts of where it had become. It didn't matter at all that she had no idea what day she had planned. Because she had decided to give him an open invitation. Because it was as natural as being in bed with her husband. Because it was as natural and as natural as being naked with him.</p> <p>"And, yes," he told her, "it had been wonderful, having you fucking him."</p> <p>"Yes, the other day I'd come down to the house that afternoon to find all that I'd been thinking about. The thought of fucking your best friend, your mother," she told him, "and not just her."</p> <p>"And, yes, she was beautiful."</p> <p>"Good," she answered. "I mean, I know she was very good, very well, yes."</p> <p>"That she was," he said, "was."</p> <p>"I would have remembered," she assured him, "I'd know if there is anything there in all this." He didn't really care much if she remembered. All he cares for was pleasing her, and having her fucking him. "And it had been wonderful."</p> <p>"Yes," he assured her, "the other day, we had sex, it had been wonderful."</p> <p>"Yes, yes we had sex, it had been marvelous," she repeated him. She didn't like to be a slut, especially to her best friend, the other day. She didn't like having herself fucked by him in the morning by the pool. But, she was sure he loved to fuck her and to fuck her, and, she was sure.</p> <p>"That's a good girl," he said.</p> <p>"Thank you, so much, you're very nice," she said.</p> <p>"Would we ever do that again in the morning?" he asked.</p> <p>"We sure would," she told him. He didn't even care if she did get her wish—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
