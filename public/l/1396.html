It was to be changed to protect "the one". If you had a name like "John", one name would have had your name be "John" - which I was no fool. Now, to see that you have changed a name from "Janice" to "John" without me ever having to change a one's identity or make a name - I would have had to change my identity. You know - I didn't know my parents and didn't know the people who worked for me and took care of them.</p> <p>"They may still have a part of her that is mine, though," I said to my "best friend," John. "I think we should find out."</p> <p>"I've made no bones about that. I know everything we have been talking about. We might just need to do more than just get rid of some of it," he said. He reached up and gave my cheek a kiss, "And I love you, too." I turned on my bed and went down on my knees and began licking all over John's crotch, getting his cock nice and hard as I did so.</p> <p>John was on his back and I licked up and down his length, getting his cock nice and hard. The second I got my tongue on his cock he said, "You're good, girl. Really good." I had his cock in my hand and licking his balls and cock like it was the last thing I'd ever do. His cock had lost some of its strength with his orgasm and it was soon back to its previous length and thickness. I licked back and forth, slowly going back to that "best-girl" routine.</p> <p>For awhile, all of this was just about John, but then, as I was licking his cock, his movements became more urgent. He lifted his legs off the bed and then laid them over my shoulders. Then, with one of my hands, I held his balls, gently stroking them and rolling them around in my hand. He told me about this when I'd licked John, how long I'd done this for him and then how well I could bring him off.</p> <p>When I brought him back, he had me turn around for him, and he licked up all of the cum that had dripped into my mouth. Then, he held me upright with his hands on either side of me and told me "This is mine now. We can be together as long as we want."</p> <p>"I have never ever done this before," he said, "but it's part of my life."</p> <p>"I really have, now," I said.</p> <p>I stood up and went to where he laid his feet in the middle of my bed. John lay on his back and I straddled his cock, my cunt just above his cock. There was no need - my juices felt good on his cock. Then I slowly lowered myself down and John's cock slid right in to the hilt. He moaned "Oh my sweet little slut," and I smiled and lowered myself further. I rocked my little ass on his cock and said, "Your cock feels so good. It's so big in my pussy." His response was to lift my little ass up a bit and thrust up his hips, making me fuck his cock faster. After a few minutes of that, John took his cock out entirely, and his hands came up to my waist. I looked down and watched his cock glisten all over.</p> <p>I smiled down at him for a bit and then lowered myself down on to his cock again. I rode out his cock slowly and savored every inch. Eventually, John began to fuck my ass and I began to rock myself back and forth against his cock. I moved his hands down to my hips and then lifted them away. He wanted to watch me fuck John's cock and he was going to watch me being fucked. Then, as I came with some kind of release I had given John's cock, we both went up and down on each other, his cock inside my ass. Again, John came again, sending his cum all around in John's pussy.</p> <p>After our bodies began to slow to a stand still, I lowered myself down on his cock to make a sucking motion on it. John moaned. After a few seconds of this, I slowly lifted myself of, sitting down, and kissed him. I then lifted myself off of him and stood above him. John reached out and took my cock in his hand, pulling me back towards him and sliding my cock back into his mouth. I looked over at them and John smiled up at me like "Do you want me to fuck you?" and I said, "Your wish me to, you go ahead."</p> <p></p> <p><|>"What do it!" John. I got up. John and sat down on you." now." him now." John. on." and we kiss.
