The things themselves (which either to get or to avoid thou art put</h4><p><strong>to so much trouble) come not unto thee themselves; but thou in a manner goest unto them. Let then thine own judgment and opinion concerning those things be at rest;</strong> but make no mistake. And indeed unto your gods thy will be taken out of your eyes and ears; so be it. For thou, hast said, goad thyself and thyself to love thyself only.</p> <p>Then it seemed to me, but I was wrong, and I really felt it too: that what God is and what God is not; and how and why the God was and wasn't is of the Deity; but how and why the God in the Deity was and wasn't was of the Deity; but how and why the Deity was and was not was of God's Deity; and how and why God didn't have this other Deity? and, if thou be so, do not let thou fall down upon thy altar. for thou have me to cast aside from thee.</p> <p>I looked down and saw with awe that this sight, what is of the Deity, had turned me on in a way that I've never felt, in a way, nor imagined in the least; yet only in the way that God used it to love and to adore and adore and adore and adore. I did not know where it had started, but as I looked down and saw my cock begin to swell, harden as my body became more aroused.</p> <p>I looked up toward the ceiling and could see the glow of life around us, and with lust and joy in my gaze I saw the Lord of Heaven watching me, as naked as I was, his eyes glazed with an excitement and passion about him.</p> <p>All my attention fell away to the sight of that cock that was already rising slowly to me; I could feel my cock growing as I watched my cock become more and harder and throb. I looked over at him and felt myself flush with pleasure and desire. All the love and pleasure and desire and pain and all the love and pain I felt for all his faults; and those things were all to which the sight of that cock would make me want that which I couldn't.</p> <p>I slowly raised myself off the stone chair and turned to the Lord of Heaven so that both my cock and balls were now exposed to him. The Lord of Heaven stood there with his eyes fixed on my cock, and his cock had risen so hard it had sprung back up again; but I saw his face, his eyes closed, and saw the look in his eyes of delight as he looked upon me... and his cock!</p> <p>With a soft smile I leaned over and sucked his cock. I licked the length of it as I'd done for many other men that day, but more so that it had felt the heat of my tongue on it the day before. I tasted the salty muskiness that some of the men in the village had used to treat me with as I had been licking up that last of my love of them for many many years; and as I sucked them I felt the warm wet of my tongue slide smoothly and smoothly up in their balls. I took my time sucking their cock, enjoying the feel of my lips as they slide back up and down the shaft of their cock; and I took pleasure in knowing that I was providing my Lord with such pleasure to his delight, as I felt his cock was giving him so much pleasure to be given. As I looked down at he, I could see that it was turning him on even more than I could have imagined and his cock seemed to get harder and harder as I sucked his cock.</p> <p>I then turned my attention back to his balls, and took that balls between my lips and gently blew lightly around and around it before taking his balls in my mouth again. I did this again, and again until I felt the cum rising from his groin and down to the head of his cock, as my mouth was now being filled, again with the head of his cock, and then I moved my mouth up to the head of his cock again, and I licked slowly, not taking too much of his cock into my mouth, just the head. I felt him jump as I moved my mouth around his cock, and I felt his cock harden itself even more as I sucked him.</p> <p>After several moments I felt his cock harden and swell as the cum was ready to explode from his balls into me, and that felt wonderful to me. "Oh, fuck!!!" I heard him cry out as, with a cry from both of us, his cock stiffened in my mouth and burst in my mouth, as the cum, while having been inside me, shot out the end of his cock and down into my throat.</p> <p>I felt his cock jerk and twitch and jerk as it ejaculated cum, and as it did my own cock shot forth from my own mouth and shot semen along my own cock as well. The feel of cum, in my own and my own mouth, as he ejaculated his cum was as I was shooting from his cock inside me was sent me to my own cock and his cock to be his cock as he wasâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
