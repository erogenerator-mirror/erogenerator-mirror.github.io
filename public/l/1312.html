The Will</h4><p><strong>As soon as Barrois had left the room, Noirtier looked at Valentine with a malicious expression that said many things. The young girl perfectly understood the look, and so did</strong> the boy.</p> <p>"Hey."</p> <p>"No! It's not what it looks like."</p> <p>"I know. I know that. If we were in the dark, we'd have something."</p> <p>"That would be pretty cold."</p> <p>"Well, maybe I'd better start looking around."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"For once, you'll get away with it. There's no future in that, baby. I can't be responsible for you if you're still a virgin."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>It was a lie but it was also true that no one except Mr. Banes would have the balls to go through with that. The woman at the counter was wearing her wedding ring, and her heart ached as she watched her boyfriend.</p> <p>"Are you okay?"</p> <p>"Oh, God, yes. I just need to get out of here."</p> <p>"I'll be right out," she replied, then got up to go to the ladies' room. The boy was on the other side of her, and the woman behind him was on her way out.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The day in question was a Friday and the night was the same. It had been a long, cold winter day. As a consequence, the two girls had to get up to bed to help clear out the snow. When Noirt was in bed, both of them got naked and got into bed.</p> <p>The boy's body was warm and firm, no bones needed, and his penis was very impressive. But his face did not reflect his thoughts of beauty, Noirt had told him that. He was not the person that she had expected to attract: he stood just right. But this was different. She was a virgin, her first time with a man. And even though she knew what she would find there, even though she knew that she needed to kiss his forehead or to kiss his lips, it still was a first for her. He was the most important person in her life, and she was just a girl. As the night went on, they could both enjoy sex with each other. As night fell, she closed her eyes in relief and joy. That was all it took for her to begin to feel so loved and cared for. It was everything she knew she deserved - she was not his sister!</p> <p>Noirt, however, was not ready to go out with her family. It was time for her to be alone with the boy and that he would forget his own virginity. So they went to a local hotel to have a drink and talk. But she could not have done that before today. It was not what they had planned to talk about, either.</p> <p>"What?" he asked.</p> <p>"I just wanted to talk," Noirt replied. Then she kissed him lightly.</p> <p>"Really? Did it turn you on last night?"</p> <p>"What do you mean?" No, never do that again.</p> <p>But he didn't care. He kissed her again, and Noirt felt his penis rising. She let out a sigh and reached down to guide it into her.</p> <p>"Aaaaaaah!!"</p> <p>The sound was unlike anyone ever heard and Noirt found herself getting wet as she waited for his penis to penetrate her.</p> <p>He began to move inside her, and Noirt felt so good that she felt almost guilty.</p> <p>"Do you like it?" he asked.</p> <p>Yes. Yes. It was so good.</p> <p>"Do you want me to change?"</p> <p>"It's okay."</p> <p>"Well, I'm not sure."</p> <p>"I know you can change, if you want. Just go ahead."</p> <p>She did. She looked down at his penis for a moment and then she closed her eyes again.</p> <p>"Can we do it inside?"</p> <p>"Uh, yeah, sure. Why not?"</p> <p>He was right. She would want him to stick it up her ass, as a matter of fact.</p> <p>But he was not sure of the right answer to that question. But he also knew that the most important question was whether Noirt was an ass slut. That would have to come later.</p> <p>But now she did need to understand that a man's penis is a penis and no woman is a cock slut. She was a virgin until last night, and that was only because her brother-in-law didn't understand. If she were not to feel that way then she wouldn't be like him. But that didn't mean that there was the right answer to this question.</p> <p>As she tried to imagine what it was going to feel, she had a hard to be the right, she touched. So if it might do it. But it was going to stay there. "I can I just give it up my ass slut. I can't go with ass I got it all," she'd let youâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
