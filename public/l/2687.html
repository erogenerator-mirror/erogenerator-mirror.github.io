From this, that the Law is a Command, and a Command consisteth in declaration, or manifestation of the will of him that commandeth, by voyce, writing, or some other</strong> purpose, and hence, is called the law of limitations of the law.</p> <p>The Law is the Law of the law.</p> <p>As I read the word fuck in the middle of all of this, and all over again (I want to say 'Fantastic sex', but I'm not sure if you can really, really, quote this word in the middle of the law). I have come to respect that word. The word fuck refers to sexual expression of sexual lust. The word fuck implies sexual desire for someone. (That is why they are such wonderful fuckers. In a little while anyway, I would like to be so very fucking, so fucking horny, that he would want to fuck me and screw me and fuck me and screw me over and over again until we were completely drained of all that sexual energy).</p> <p>It's because men are sexual beings, but the law of limitations in the law applies to those which are considered to be superior in sex. We are, or were, human beings in a way, and so are we. Sex is a human part of who you are sexually, and so you are made to fuck. We are, and are, people with a desire to possess as great a sexual pleasure as you are with a desire to possess as much pleasure as you are giving, and the pleasure that a man can get from fucking is beyond our understanding, and it is time for him to have a different opinion.</p> <p>He can, I think, understand, but I can't. It makes me feel like I'm making a decision. I don't understand. I have no sense of what I'm asking for. I have no respect for anyone, and I do not know how to be any more sure of what I am asking for. It's no longer my will of sexual lust, but the will of all men; I feel like a fuck for any of them. I'll just say it. I feel like an object for them to fuck, and it feels real. It feels like the real thing, and, like I want it for myself.</p> <p>Yes, I'll say it; all right I will, and I'm a man. I've done this, and I want to do it again, and again, and again. Is that the word fuck in the middle of all of this? That is, though, too much, too fast, too fast.</p> <p>Fuck the Law: The Law of the Law</p> <p>God is my body. (As is this word). He is my body.</p> <p>I've fucked all men. (Yes, yes, yes.)</p> <p>I've fucked men in the back of the van (Yes, yes, so, so fucking sexy.).</p> <p>I've fucked the driver (Yes, yes, and oh, how I love that word!). (Yeah, I do! I love that word!)</p> <p>I'd never fuck them in the back of the van (Yes, yes, and oh, so damn sexy!).</p> <p>"Fuck the way it does in the back of the vehicle" (Yes, yes, yes, again!)</p> <p>I'd never fuck those men in their van (You know, I was just as surprised by their van as they were.)</p> <p>I've fucked in an alley (Yes, yes, yes, yes, again!)</p> <p>I've fucked in a pub and nightclub (Yes, yes, yes, again) (Yes, yes, please God, again, please God!)</p> <p>I've fucked one of the men whose face I kissed (Yes, yes! and yes!) (God, he was my type) (Jesus, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!)</p> <p>I've fucked two men in the cab of a cab (Yes, God, I'm cumming again, please God, more, please more!)</p> <p>And, yes, in the shower (Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!) (Don't feel guilty, you know it's the Law of the Law for them!) (God, I love that, God, you are such a slut!)</p> <p>I've fucked three men in one car (Yes, yes, please God, you are such a slut!) (Jesus, I'm so sorry, God, please God, I'm such a slut!)</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>This is the truth of it all.</p> <p>Yes, this is the truth of it all. The Law is the law.</p> <p>"To fuck is to fuck, God" (Yes, yes, thank you, thank you, God, thank you, thank you!)</p> <p>"As long as he's good, as long as the right woman is good, as long as the right man is good, as good for all men know in love, as good as you both well as you are good are good and evil."
