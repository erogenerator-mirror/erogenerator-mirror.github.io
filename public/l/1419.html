Not another word had I heard to enlighten me on the subject of my expectations, and my twenty-third birthday was a week gone. We</strong> were never going to have a traditional family weekend. No wedding and no fucking.</p> <p>I had just finished my shower and decided to dry myself off. The water was nice, and it was soothing; the towel had come with a pair of old clothes I had never worn. On my second day of the year, it made me feel more out of place. I didn't even have to dress up for school to get a decent amount of stares from guys and women.</p> <p>I was a different person. I had not been able to have kids because there was money; I had never been so excited to have one for a life. And yet the last five years had been hell for me.</p> <p>My hair had grown a little loose and I had gotten very wet, which was the norm for me. But that was all for the last few years on the summer.</p> <p>I decided to take the clothes the other day off. I grabbed my towel and stepped out of the bathroom. It was a good thing that showering had been so important. I looked in the mirror, and saw myself naked. I couldn't believe how hot I felt. My breasts were perky and I thought about rubbing my own nipples when I was alone with my thoughts.</p> <p>It didn't seem like being naked anymore. It just felt right to me. I got my dress out of my closet and put that back on. I slipped on the top of my sandals, my thong, and my bra. I looked in the mirror and saw that I looked more like a girl and one of my teachers. I laughed in pleasure at how much attention it would get from people in the class.</p> <p>As I walked across the street, I saw the guy who had been teasing me for the past eight months walk into the school. I walked to the front of campus and saw him catch me at the door. He gave me a little smile, kissed me on the cheek, and started to leave. He stopped me and turned to ask me what I expected to get from him.</p> <p>"We should get along now," he said. "You're just about as hot a student as any other."</p> <p>"Yes," I smiled. "I'm already over this. I know you like to keep your eyes on me though. You wouldn't know what a whore I have been, and I'm sure you'd like to know what a slut I was," I thought.</p> <p>I closed the door and I started to walk back toward my dorm. He took longer this time, kissing me, but we just stood awkwardly.</p> <p>"You really mean it, don't you?" He whispered. His kiss got a little passionate, a little wilder, but nothing was ever more passionate than his kisses in the past. If I had known how much I liked him, I would have jumped him right then and there. "You are a slut, aren't you?"</p> <p>"Yes," I whispered and he kissed me again. "I love to be used. You have a very hot body, Mr. Anderson."</p> <p>"Yes," he moaned. "I'll be happy to fuck you anytime you want."</p> <p>"That's what you're going to get," I smiled. "I'll let you fuck me. I want all your hard cocks in me."</p> <p>"Is that okay?"</p> <p>"That's fine with me," I said. "Just let me do the work."</p> <p>He kissed me one last time, and I went inside.</p> <p>I was very excited and I got wet at what I had just heard from a guy. I really needed to be careful with whom I took off their clothes. It felt so good being naked in public. I wanted to feel free, but I also wanted to be alone too. What was I becoming?</p> <p>I got to my dorm and went in. There was a beautiful girl waiting for me.</p> <p>I had her undress and was trying to decide how to approach her.</p> <p>She was beautiful. She had black hair which she wore up into a loose ponytail and it was long enough to cover her lower half. It was a cute thing because it looked like she was wearing a little leather halter dress. It just about covered her ass, but enough of it went up to her hip. When she pulled it tight, I was glad they didn't have a strap on.</p> <p>"Hi," I said and took her hand.</p> <p>"Hi," she replied. "We should have gotten these on together."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I said. "They look like something a woman would wear to go out to the movies with some guy."</p> <p>"I don't know," she replied. "That's a dress comes off without much better." Her body was amazing. I don't think of her, and her tits, but they were the same kind of size. Maybe 36c and a little ofâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
