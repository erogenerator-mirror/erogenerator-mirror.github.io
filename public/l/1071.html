It ends by becoming bearable. It finally assumes a form, and adjusts itself. One vegetates, that is to say, one</strong>'s life is a dalliance. It's too bad that there are no good people to do the jobs. It just does the job, too.</p> <p>So, in the old days, the "I'll do anything I'd liked to do" thing was a joke.</p> <p>In the 1950's, and in the 70's, the movie, "Goth," was even more popular than it has been on the porn channel now. Of course, the film had more than one, if not three endings. As far as I know, "All you can do is fuck" is a joke of epic proportions. Still, in some ways, it's even better than that movie did with the "all you can do is fuck" ending. For one thing, the sex is fun, but it is also frustrating. If you want to do a good job of it, then you have to try.</p> <p>What it's like to have a man of substance over a guy who has the sex you want; that is to have the sex without him knowing it, but in the way your sex life is now. If you would rather to have sex with someone who has the experience and wisdom of all of these men, then you have to try to find a good one.</p> <p>For example, I guess you could say that sex with Jim is a serious and serious relationship. However, it was never the same with Jim. He became more or less daily, more and more infatuated with me, almost as if I still existed. During a few memorable moments, I've become very interested in the idea of having his body. At least, that's how I'm going to think of it.</p> <p>However, the real reason I'm giving Jim a blowjob is to keep him guessing while he's in a state of total bliss. And it's no fun when he has to ask me to go down on him, whenever he wants me to suck him off, whenever I want him to cum in my mouth or even, for that matter, when I want to eat him while he's in a state of utter bliss. I'm not saying that Jim and I are not still having wild sex, but we certainly are not doing so as far as sex is concerned. If we're not together and we're both having lots of sex, then why would he think I'm not taking part.</p> <p>He did ask himself something though, and he asked me to do it again. I'd better give him a big smile when I say that.</p> <p>It had to be the same with the other two guys, which is to say, of course, I'd say so himself and have a look of awe at what he had to offer. Also, it had to be a guy's idea to have sex with me. He did have the experience and wisdom and experience, but I did have all the experience of all three of us in his world, so I didn't have the experience.</p> <p>So, as long as it's a good idea to have a special kind of sex and have Jim's body, I really do feel that I'm doing it right. He's an active participant, whether it be in giving pleasure to my lover, in watching movies on TV, or helping someone else with their homework; he's also a good, fun, caring lover with whom to have and to talk with, which is to say, to enjoy. I think that's what he means by having a romantic and sexual relationship with me. I think he means, in a way, that he'd enjoy making love to me on a level I'd rather have with someone else.</p> <p>I'd be a fool not to make a mental note of it, even though I'm thinking so myself.</p> <p>It also makes me look forward to his arrival. I always do enjoy him, and I have to admit I'm a happy person by having a relationship with a man of substance.</p> <p>THE OTHER CHEESES</p> <p>There are a few things I'd like for him to do, as an example.</p> <p>First, if you're going to be doing something that you feel you're not doing, then just enjoy it. Secondly, when you're alone and I'm not in the hotel or, well, you don't see me, go elsewhere. I think it's fun to go to bed with Jim. You just have to love him and appreciate how he's doing.</p> <p>If I was going to do it next week and it was just him, I wouldn't even be here but I would still be here. So I'll enjoy what he's doing, but in the meantime, it's all good with him. I know that he's there in your arms, with you and with me.</p> <p>And, We just enjoy this is my special, if you're special in all that's between us.</p> <p>So you both,</p> <p>' <), and special in my—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
