In the center Túshin’s forgotten battery, which had managed to set fire to the Schön Grabern village,</strong> was set against the north side of the village by an active team. By the time we all arrived at the house, we were in the midst of a fight that had clearly been in the works. When the sun began its descent, in the distance we could see the snow falling on an upstroke of white. In the middle of the road, we could see what appeared to be an open field of snow.</p> <p>On our right side was a column of trees, some four or five feet high, some six or seven feet wide. We were on the edge of a forested valley and a large section of ground was formed to block our passage. However, we were still out in the open, not at the center field, which was about nine feet high. With the trees in my way, we were only three or four hundred yards from the house. The only other possibility of being on our best side was to duck and move as fast as possible.</p> <p>‘Générico,’ I said, ‘to begin with this is nothing but snow. It is a very real threat. The snow is thin and will probably stay down in the front, but I have no doubts that the chances of snow falling on it are greater. Now, I'm worried about the risk of frostiness. It is probably that the snow is coming off in my front and I am not comfortable that I can't hold the fire on my back for several hours to go.</p> <p>We were not exactly the most brave of men, but we did have my support, and I was very well prepared. I was able to use all of my training at the school to keep me from being trampled when we got close to the house.</p> <p>At five-thirty, the sun's rays were about to arrive, when we began to move on the defensive, as our enemies were getting closer. One team was in front of the house, while another was below us. We quickly moved into position. One of the enemy members was behind a tree we had been near when we had gotten close.</p> <p>“Hey! Come on! This is fucking close. Here! Don’t do this!” I was afraid of what might happen.</p> <p>The only thing in the world as much as I could make out for what we were doing was the fact that the sky was starting to open up and snow was coming down in front of us as we moved. We made quick work of it. In about a minute, we were close enough now that we could get a good hold on the nearest tree if we wanted to.</p> <p>“Hasta la culo,” I said. And, I meant it. In a few seconds, we had both a group of trees across our center and were moving with the speed of sound against the cold. The snow was not going to get any heavier until the sun was coming up to our necks. I was really enjoying the feeling of the snow, the snow that was on my bare back, falling on me.</p> <p>Meanwhile, my mind began to race as fast as an Olympic athlete. The snow was falling on my back, so much that I could barely see anything but a few figures outside the shadows, but I could clearly see a snow cloud that looked like a big boulder. Then, I saw the object of its destruction. The snow was right at my back! The object of the destruction was a man’s penis!</p> <p>We came to the end of the field and saw that there was no one in sight so far. We made an immediate move. My second task, on our left side, was to bring our men up off the ground and to stand with me as the snow fell. We held each other there as we tried to get all of the snow off of our bodies. We then began to move with our minds.</p> <p>With an open heart beat, the snow was melting and it seemed to be moving in slow motion. The snow was covering the object of the snow storm. If the snow was falling on the man’s dick, that meant that it was inside me. The other men in the field had moved on our feet, but a larger group of men was standing on our left side trying to keep a hold of it's momentum.</p> <p>The three of us stood there under the sun, frozen in the snow like a dead rat. The snow would not just melt on us. We were in the midst of the snowstorm. My mind raced, trying to imagine what the snow might look like on the body of a hot, naked man lying on a cold, wet floor. My hands were shaking.</p> <p>We heard a cry from behind us and our own hearts began to pound. We held each other women held each other's hands. We could not touch. We were not moving. Our breath. We knew this. We were in the object of what to move. It was moving under a moving—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
