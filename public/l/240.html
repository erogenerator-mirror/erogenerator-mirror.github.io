The Prairie.</h4><p><strong>To scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this Leviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has as yet undertaken.</strong> His face was not visible, so I couldn't see much from it.</p> <p>"Are you ready to get back on that machine?" I said to him while taking the base on the machine's arm.</p> <p>"Oh yes," he said.</p> <p>"Okay, lets get you started."</p> <p>I was on the machine and ready to go. He came at me instantly. I grabbed him firmly, wrapping my arms around his neck and my legs around his waist. He came at me as though he wanted to be fucked in every hole. We got to the machine's arm stand.</p> <p>"There you go," I said, before kissing him passionately. He came at me like he thought I'd never do it again. So much of his life was in those places he had no idea existed. I knew it. I started to rub my pussy on the arm of the machine, before inserting the cock-shaped probe. The head hit my G-spot with an audible "O". I came immediately. I felt a shiver up my spine and all my body went limp in reaction.</p> <p>I went to his cock and started sucking it. I was a woman in love with it. It was a gift that he'd never get from anyone else before. It was the first real sex I'd ever had and it was like a gift that someone could give to anyone and I just loved it</p> <p>When he started thrusting in me while looking at me intently, I thought I could cum again. This new position worked wonders for my vaginal muscles. I could feel the dildo vibrating against my clit every time he thrust deep inside me.</p> <p>He kept thrusting, which brought me to just the right spot inside, so I could reach with my hand and reach further. I started stroking his cock while feeling his cum. We kept going at it till his cum was all gone and that it was starting to leak out of me.</p> <p>"No condom?" A man asked.</p> <p>"Nope."</p> <p>"Here. I think I'll leave that up to you," I said to him.</p> <p>He pushed in and I went to my knees to suck him.</p> <p>"You're the one sucking me now," the man said.</p> <p>"I've always wanted to do it like this," I replied.</p> <p>The man continued watching my every move when the phone went off.</p> <p>"What was that?" I said to him while sucking his cock.</p> <p>"Nothing," he said.</p> <p>"What happened to the guy that just came?" I asked.</p> <p>"We came?" he said.</p> <p>I didn't want to ask the question.</p> <p>"We were both drunk but that doesn't mean anything," I said.</p> <p>"We both drank something?" The man asked.</p> <p>"To try to get away. It'll happen any second now."</p> <p>"We were so close," the man said.</p> <p>"We're not leaving until your cock is back there," I retorted.</p> <p>"Not yet. I feel the same way," the man said.</p> <p>"I feel a little woozy. I think we should get back on that machine," I said.</p> <p>"I don't think so," the man said.</p> <p>We got back on the machine after a short time. It was the first time in such a long period of time for us to come. I was feeling really good. We took it in turns to fuck in different places. The whole thing was pretty short, but it was good to me and it felt great to him too.</p> <p>When my lover came in my mouth, the man also came in my mouth. It was great to my lover. We kissed, tasted each other's tongues and our lips locked into the same pose for a while. After a while, the man pulled himself out of me and we kissed.</p> <p>We then sat on his side and continued kissing. I had one button undone. It was so unimportant. We had come together again. I thought about that first time. In an act of love, I had shared that very first time with a couple of people who'd just met. I thought of how it felt with the man and how it made me feel.</p> <p>"I love you," I whispered to him and felt my heart flutter for him.</p> <p>We embraced each other with our mouths again. I closed my eyes, opened my eyes and looked at the face of both of them. At length, we broke. It took our breath away. I put my hand on his cheek. The man was a very happy moment had passed between me and the two of two people of all this way. and this was no more powerful than the first time. If anyone. was so true love between us. I thought. We'd known each other people. I thought the same kind.
