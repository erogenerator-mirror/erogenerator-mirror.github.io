Haydée</h4><p><strong>It will be recollected that the new, or rather old, acquaintances of the Count of Monte Cristo, residing in the Rue Meslay, were no other than Maximilian, Julie, and Emmanuel.</strong> We all arrived in Monte Cristo in this same car in the following month.</p> <p>I got off the train and made my way into the museum. Julie's sister, Emma, greeted me with the same greeting she always did, and Emma introduced me to many of the other acquaintances there. By nine, we were engaged in a very lengthy conversation and all we had in common was being friends. We finished our lunch at a restaurant a block from the Metropolis.</p> <p>One hundred and twenty-five minutes later, we were in a bar a few blocks from the museum: we had eaten, drank, and had sex. And in what we were sure to be an unforgettable Valentine's Day. We drank so much that no one dared be a porter in Monte Cristo.</p> <p>In another alley behind the museum, we fucked for four hours in the alley behind. In the alley I had a lot of fun: I was fucking Julie's sister Emma, we fucked for a half an hour in the alley behind the museum. Emma had an unusually good orgasm from me fucking her sister in the back of my car. Emma was in my car with Julie and I, fucking me in bed for the next four hours, but my sexual energy was diminished when Emma's orgasm overwhelmed hers, and she orgasmed from my fucking her in the alley next to us.</p> <p>Another block ahead, we heard a knock on the door at exactly nine thirty in the morning, and Emma opened the door and welcomed me, wearing a very seductive look, and looking exactly as she had a week before. I introduced Julie to Emma, and she hugged me, which Emma had been doing in Monte Cristo.</p> <p>"Good morning, Mademoiselle," Emma said. "I like you."</p> <p>Emma took off my jacket, revealing a long shirt, black slacks, and shoes. Emma kissed me passionately, and ran her hands through my chest hair. Emma kissed me on the lips, and we broke off the kiss, and she took off my shirt, exposing my chest hair for the first time. I was now naked in the museum, surrounded on all sides by beautiful young women, as my beautiful friends embraced me. Emma kissed me gently on the lips, and then we continued our kissing for a few moments more. Emma was obviously very experienced in kissing, and our kisses aroused Emma even more. My lips were on the back of her neck, Emma's lips on my ears, Emma's hands on my breasts that swelled under Emma's jacket, Emma's hands on my hips and butt cheeks. It seemed we had no time to get dressed before the next door visitor knocked at precisely ten o'clock in the morning.</p> <p>Emma and I broke off our kissing to get ready for bed. Emma undressed me completely naked and lay on her back on the bed. Emma got out the condom and put it on me. Emma had never been with a woman before and this was just to be my first time.</p> <p>Emma was definitely different than Emma had previously been: she was much taller and more voluptuous; she didn't have her weight on, but her muscles were very strong against her flat stomach and chest. Emma's boobs were smaller, but more firm than Julie's. Emma wore nothing under her uniform except a thin pair of leopard print panties.</p> <p>Emma had never been with a woman before, and she was obviously a little scared because of that. Emma did have small tits, but she had an awesome body. Emma's butt was very firm despite that small, but very shapely, and for some reason I could see some hair around Emma's vagina, like dark hair surrounding a penis. Emma's vagina was shaved and the lips were very pretty, despite her big boobs and large thighs.</p> <p>Emma got on the bed with me and we hugged and kissed for another minute, then Emma looked me dead in the eyes and said:</p> <p>"You are the only person on Earth who's ever seen a girl naked before."</p> <p>I kissed Emma again, and as I kissed Emma's lips I said:</p> <p>"I've seen lots of women, and some of them are very pretty, but my friend's in Monte Cristo."</p> <p>Emma kissed me again, and said:</p> <p>"Don't you feel a little silly being naked in Monte Cristo? You are not naked because there are girls there who will be naked when we come back for you."</p> <p>Emma smiled at me, and said:</p> <p>"In a few minutes, I'm going to be naked too. But I also feel a thrill just thinking of being naked with you." I am naked Emma. I was wearing nothing at all by wearing only my socks. Butting shoes. Allyson all day.</p> <p>I didn't know. I had a pretty socks. . I look sexy when we could really pretty, but I can't—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
