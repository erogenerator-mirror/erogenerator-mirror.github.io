I was twenty-nine, married to a man, and in love with him for years. He was an intelligent adult, and he was not a stranger to having sex – he was one of the closest acquaintances I had. However, we have never had any such relationship, and I love him and care for him but cannot even be that close. However, his first night here, he was an utter gentleman, and he enjoyed making love to me. We went through many stages in our relationship. We spent all night watching films, going to the cinema, watching the opera, drinking, chatting on the telephone and then we went to bed. We masturbated, but did not actually make love. But a few evenings later, the sexual tension between us was overwhelming and we were in our bed, the bed he has occupied, the bed of our future husband, the bed we will be making love to each other. Our love was strong, and we were fully compatible. I wanted him, and he wanted me. But we also wanted to know and be compatible; it was like a puzzle I never knew about.</p> <p>We had begun to experiment; the first night of our relationship was when he came home after a very long evening with me. He got undressed while I was watching television, and started kissing me, touching me, and in many ways, enjoying my body. But we were having too much sex with our first night, and were not completely ready to consummate our relationship.</p> <p>***How do you like it? Should it be difficult?</p> <p>***I am not sure what happened with sex, but I still feel it was special between us. How it is difficult to explain it? But in many ways, it is much better to express oneself in a positive way and to enjoy the experience of life in a happy, loving, carefree way if there is something to be learned in sex—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
