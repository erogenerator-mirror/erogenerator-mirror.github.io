I looked at myself in the mirror. I'd lost the weight. I'm a 5'8" tall with a solid 170 lbs body while at the same time at 5'7" and at around 205 lbs. I'm not skinny but I don't look too fat with just my 5'5" frame. I don't need all of it. My body still responds nicely. I get my butt back under control.</p> <p>The door to the shower stall unlocked. I put the shower curtain down and leaned over to go in. I got my hair down and brushed out my ear. I put my hand down below my waistline.</p> <p>It's not bad to wash the body that has been hiding forever out here.</p> <p>I'd like to be able to wash and play the body of some good-looking man who was only half a month out of the Navy, but I'm not looking to become a model.</p> <p>"Not much to wash?" I asked, and then I looked down at my chest. I took my shirt off. "Just take off your bra and go for your briefs too."</p> <p>I looked down. The fabric of my briefs felt tight across my chest and waist. And I wanted to be wearing something sexy with my briefs on. I took my briefs off and stepped into the shower stall, closed the curtain, and took off my briefs.</p> <p>"I've got to wash my hair," I said.</p> <p>"You have," replied my sweet neighbor Tim. "Let me wash yours."</p> <p>I washed my head, and my neck. I used one hand to soaped me up and the other hand to soap up my crotch. "Turn around and rinse the shampoo from your hair."</p> <p>When the suds washed my hair, I turned around, rinsed my hair, and rinsed my neck and shoulders again. I turned around to get my back. Tim's hands were busy as well. I leaned back against the bathroom wall. Tim's hands were making their way all around my body, massaging my legs, ass, breasts, stomach, pussy, stomach, tits, legs, stomach, pussy, ass and chest and stomach, and he kept his hands working out my body and my body was washing from his fingers. His fingers were feeling me up.</p> <p>"Nice shampoo," replied Tim to my question. With his index fingers he gently combed his fingers through my hair, and then he brought them up to the back of my neck.</p> <p>"I bet. Nice shampoo," I said back to Tim.</p> <p>With his fingers combed through my hair, his hands started moving lower, down to my ass.</p> <p>"Hmmmm," I said to Tim. I wasn't really saying that to him. I wasn't really offering an 'oops but, it's hot in here,' proposition. I wasn't actually offering an offer to Tim's fingers that his cock had already been feeling up, and his fingers were now combing and feeling up my ass.</p> <p>"I bet you wish I could wash everything for you," Tim said to me. His hands were caressing my body. "I bet you like to be washed, don't you?" Tim said to me as he continued to play with my hair.</p> <p>"Yes," I said to Tim as I moved a step back from the shower wall, pushed my feet further apart and moved my butt forward while still keeping one hand on my ass and other behind my back. "I'd love to be bathed by your hands." I'm not sure why I said that, especially as I was beginning to get turned on. I was trying very hard not to act like I was just trying to turn on a guy.</p> <p>"Don't you wanna wash your hair?" Tim asked me after rubbing my ass.</p> <p>"Yes, but I'd really like to see your beautiful body," I said as I turned around in a circular motion.</p> <p>Tim's hands were back roaming all around my body. He was rubbing all the front parts of my body with his hands. They were rubbing all my body, front, back, sides, butt, breasts and stomach. They played all my body with their hands. It felt wonderful too.</p> <p>Tim's hands were also rubbing all over my front side, and back. They were sliding all around my back. My body just below and stomach and legs and side. It was all felt so sensually touching all over my tummy front and below</p> <p></p> <p>I continued to and</p> <p>there were all oversâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
