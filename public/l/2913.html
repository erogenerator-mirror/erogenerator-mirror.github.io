(See Erotic Coupling Guide, and the Author's note for that part.) I shall not repeat, but it is the act of fucking, in order to become Lord or Savior, or to destroy the evil, depraved, depraved wickedness which is the perverted wickedness of the sin of fucking.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>* %</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>"There it is," I said once we were ready. "I think you're right; it's been a long weekend, honey. Come on. Let's go take a swim in the ocean, shall we?"</p> <p>Hmmmm; I thought; 'I wonder if we will do that!' He led me by the hand upstairs to the master bedroom, where I had an unguarded moment to enjoy the sun and warm sand, when I'd seen his large, erect, but not nearly as erect a cock as I remembered having. He did not say anything about his erect cock, yet it did take all my will power to stay in the mood. I was getting aroused, actually, and he was not. We lay back down on the bed. We kissed, he kissed and I sucked the end of his cock when we heard the splash of surf. He reached and held my hand as I slowly slipped the end into my soft, wet vagina, and then slid the rest into him. Oh my - I thought, 'This will feel fantastic!' He kissed me. We kissed and then he kissed again, and we kissed like two long time lovers, as he continued pumping in and out of me. We kissed and kissed and kissed a while longer, then he gently pulled out of me and moved me onto my knees in front of him, then he knelt and held me and kissed me deeply and then we kissed again; our tongues exploring and dueling with each other, for several wonderful minutes.</p> <p>And as if to confirm what I felt and wanted, he gently moved me up until I lay on my back on the bed. When I did this, my beautiful, naked body was laid out in front of him and he raised the hem of my dress to see my legs: all tanned, not tanned, but beautifully tanned.</p> <p>"Oh my, you are beautiful," he said, softly as he looked me up and down; I had the best tan he'd ever seen. He took my hand in his and kissed it. "And yes, you're lovely," he said.</p> <p>I moved forward, and he lifted my dress and kissed my breasts and then sucked my nipples, making me groan out loud. Then he sucked both of my nipples in his mouths, and I put my hand to my lips and sucked them for both of us again for a minute and then he moved between my legs and looked at my pussy. Again, he slid his lovely tongue out to wet my labia, and he slowly brought it to my vagina and started to flick my clitoris. I was so excited I couldn't help pushing my clit upwards towards his face so he could have better access to what was so important and sensitive, so he knew exactly what to do to make me feel good. My cunt was throbbing from the excitement, and I had to have him between my legs immediately.</p> <p>I lifted myself and allowed him to move between my legs and he gently positioned the head of his penis to my hole and slowly inserted it into me. I held him there a while as if I was afraid to lose him, and he held me for a while. Then he lowered himself onto me, a long, low groan from him as he penetrated me. And I knew what he felt the moment he started to move in me. He started in and out, moving ever faster, as my vagina relaxed to give him more room, for he kept going in me, while I held onto his head with my hands, wanting to keep him inside me. After a while, I just felt his pubic hairs brushing my clitoris when his pubic hair brushed my pubis and I thought, 'He's about to come in me with his cock inside me!'</p> <p>Then I felt the orgasm building inside me and when there was nothing left to push, I was so turned on, so excited that I couldn't hold back. My fingers had found their way beneath his buttocks and he lifted his buttocks again, and when I gently pulled them apart from his lower body, he felt as if he had exploded, and as I felt the moment when I had been the one who had been the one to feel his coming, he lifted himself down onto me and we both came in a long, long, deep, long, intense, passionate orgasm and long and long, mutual explosion, which was the greatest orgasm which was a truly most significant moment in which I had taken place meâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
