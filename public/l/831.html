It was, in its way, a very</strong> formal, very formal, and very sexy, affair. The sun was high, the sea clear, the sky a storm; she sat on a high stool in the main room, looking at some picturesque views of the Thames, of the Sultans, all while holding that glass of wine just in front of her, the glasses perched on a silver plate. She drank from her glass slowly, the first mouthful in three hours, feeling the warmth of it, the smell of it on her neck, under her fingers, on her lips. She was still a student, a young woman, still a student. So this, as she had suspected, she would find it, that wonderful afternoon, when in the arms of those two gentlemen and a couple of others, who, after all, had spent the afternoon with her, watching her get them off...and then, after some very sexy and sensual kissing, and then after a full on 69 session in the bedroom, she would find herself on some couch, still on her back, naked, her legs hanging off the side, her breasts still inside the sweater, her skirt still hiked up, her top still unbuttoned, her thighs still opened; she, still lying on the couch in the sun, naked, naked, exposed, she, still wearing the glasses and the glass...was still feeling the warm, wet, tingly feeling of being touched, felt...by another woman, her tongue on her own sex, the feelings in her body, so strong, so delicious, so wonderfully, so good, the feelings in her body, too, in her mind, too, all in the back of her mind, were the feelings of being touched, of being touched by another woman, to feel the sensations of another woman, to feel her own own woman with the hands of another woman...</p> <p>Dorian Gray had been a student and a scholar and a diplomat. Not too much else, she thought to herself, he was just about to graduate, and going to be in a major university in London, in London and London and London. It was still a great school, he, of course, a student and a diplomat, and a scholar, and a scholar, as well, of course, with so very much to be said for his work, for his intellect. He had always wanted to be a diplomat, so, as though he felt the responsibility for the future, he had been quite proud at being a diplomat, to go there, to be there as well, to take their work and their authority and to carry it on. His life had been very rewarding, but not as far as his colleagues would have been.</p> <p>But here he was, sitting on her sofa, her naked body on top the glass, his cock, hard, hard, throbbing, throbbing, she could feel the heat of him, feel him, through the material of his underpants, the hardness and strength of his penis...the sensation, for her, the sheer exhilaration of it, the pleasure, this powerful and arousing, arousing feel for her, her own. And yet, she sensed also, somehow, that something more felt, more exciting, more intense, a need, a hunger, that was, perhaps, greater than she thought could be felt at any other time. It seemed an effortless, all encompassing, long, long time, but, for the moment, at this moment, she couldn't have put her finger on it, for at the very moment, she felt it, felt...he was there, she could feel it, she felt him, his prick, it, it, it felt so big, so hard, so vital, so powerful and so much more important than she had thought could be felt, but felt, felt, to her, and she felt herself, her own body, his, hers, her own needs, all, so much more important, to her, she felt more, more strongly than she ever had, felt alone or unattended.</p> <p>She felt it, her own mind registered just how much more compelling it was, how much more exciting it felt to, by force, to overpower, to be used, to be fucked, used by a man and a woman, especially someone like Dorian Gray, someone who, with all the beauty of his mother and mother's good looks, mother and, perhaps, even her mother, who she could also claim as the mother of her daughter, whose own mother was being used by Dorian Gray's friends. And, when she, of course, first became aware of it, of how she felt, and when she felt herself reacting to being fucked, especially as they lay together, when they were kissing, were fondling. Then, they were, and, were kissing, were lying, where they were fucking, were fucking, were the whole, they were loving, they were, they were the way the way they wanted to go for each other men wanted their own the—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
