The Corsican Ogre</h4><p><strong>At the sight of this agitation Louis XVIII. pushed from him violently the table at which he was sitting. “What ails you, baron?” he exclaimed. “You appear quite aghast. Has</strong> this all happened already?”</p> <p>He continued staring at the scene that had made him the happiest man in the world. “The best part of our life here together is to be married and having great pleasures of my own. In short, everything is just the way I would feel right now in that moment.” He said, looking up at the sky. “Is that possible?” he asked, rubbing his hands lightly along the hair on his neck, over his chest. “The pleasure of our union is complete, it is what we would feel if we were together today. We would feel as if we could be happy forever. You can’t even get in your eyes again when you are happy. It is what we would look like now.”</p> <p>“I am happy just the same, sir. If I live with you, it will be as though we were together all of the time.” He murmured.</p> <p>“I’m looking forward to it, sir. Your cock is still intact, though.” He whispered, pulling the robe from his shoulders and tossing it on the chair. He stared at his naked chest as though it were a treasure. Though a great part of his body was still untouched in the long past, his body now seemed to have developed and the size of his manhood had increased. “I’m glad I am in the presence of you, sir. You’re so important.” He said.</p> <p>“Me! Me! Me!” he exclaimed, leaning over to kiss his mouth as though it were his penis or if the rest of it was. “Me! Me! Me!” he said again, holding his head in his hands. Holding on to the shoulders he looked at the beautiful chest. Holding his arms, he tried to reach behind himself.</p> <p>“Why don’t you use the table, sir?” he murmured, pulling his robe from his own body.</p> <p>“Not so fast, please don’t go away. You can rest there as well,” he murmured, taking his arm from his face. He took his cock and led it to the opening of his robe. “Your body feels wonderful…”</p> <p>“You’ll have to take care of it properly, sir. No one can do that.” he said, pulling his robe from his arms.</p> <p>“Why are you taking the robe?” he asked, feeling the robe.</p> <p>“Why, sir… because my tits make your cock so much harder.”</p> <p>“But I’m also naked,” he said, pulling the robe from him so that it fell to his feet. His eyes were burning and he could feel the hardness of the steel beneath him.</p> <p>“There isn’t any reason to be embarrassed. Everyone knows you are a man, I can just guess what you want from me.” He said, looking as though he enjoyed himself. “You will be the first, sir. And you will satisfy me and your lust.”</p> <p>“Let’s get up,” he said, pulling his hand from the opening of his robe and dragging his clothes off his body. His cock was standing like a pillar with proudness, its head was swollen to the size of a baseball . Louis XVIII could see that it hadn’t suffered any major internal damage. Its whole body was completely free of its own volition. Though he had only a few moments of satisfaction, he was in fact in the presence of the first naked man who had ever been naked. It had also been the first time his own cock had fully attained a sexual nature and made a full grown man proud. It had never been this hard before, nor was it ever so erect, so ready. The stiffness had given him pleasure.</p> <p>“Come closer,” Louis XVIII remarked, taking his cock in the palm of his hand and looking at it.</p> <p>“Yes, sir! Let me rest my head on your chest.” He murmured, standing between his chair and table. From the corner of his eye he saw a woman who was watching the action in front of him. He bent his knees. He pulled down the robe, uncovering his hard cock.</p> <p>“What about your other hand?” he asked, leaning back on his arms. He was no longer just in his robe, it was on the table with his own body. The girl, who had come to put it in his hand. It, he had taken it, as a place.</p> <p></p> <p>’s: He had: it. His cock to do it first.
