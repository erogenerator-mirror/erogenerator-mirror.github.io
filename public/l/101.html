My God, all that is still available. I guess I’m going to fuck the Queen of England, but we’re going to go ahead and buy our own.”</p> <p>I was a little unsure, so I said simply, “I’m happy.” I’d done it before, though it’s not really as special to me as it must be to you. I’d fucked the King of Europe many times before, so don’t be surprised if I’m making a big mistake. But that doesn’t change how much I love you. I wish I could live with you forever.</p> <p>We have to go. We have to go, don’t we? I mean, we’re both tired out, and I have to take you home and tell you how much I love you. But it’s not the same without you. I’ll even go talk on the phone to your sister one day - maybe you can get to know someone there or at least she’s your sister.”</p> <p>He reached into a bag and pulled out an old dress. It looked old but had probably been brought down by the time I was born, so it was very old even though we were in the military. It was very tight; the only difference was it was almost invisible. There were many other layers that couldn’t hide the huge, hard cock between his legs, if he had his way. You can't hide that much cock in a dress, can you? I thought about the Queen of England, naked and bound and with her tits and pussy and ass and her tits and puss. What about that - that’s another woman for you, eh? Just get them out and let her catch them? No way - no fuckin way!</p> <p>I picked a pair of dark grey jeans that had the word “Tess” across the front. They had that sexy, lacy black pattern that was so good on guys. When my friend Jill picked the jeans out of the bag, it was just the kind of jeans I would have wore in public, but I knew that wouldn’t be the same. The jeans were kind of like what she had in her bag. They had a nice, low rise scooped neckline that was nice and low, but the deep plunge with the high collar showed a lot of cleavage. They buttoned up the front, but the back just came across the bottom of my butt. The back was tight. Not quite elastic, but definitely just right. So tight that it almost felt like it had a knot going straight through my butt, or maybe it did.</p> <p>“Wow, we can take the Queen’s clothes and put them on.”</p> <p>I laughed. “No way, not with that long of a dick’s life,” I said. Then I took the dress off and turned around. The shirt came next, and there was no doubt about that - the scooped neckline was sexy as hell. It hung low around my hips and my breasts were bare, for a moment. The low neckline looked kind of like it had just been sprayed on without even being cool. I could feel my nipples harden, and I looked up at him. My eyes flicked down to the front of the shirt and my pussy tingled a little. He saw too.</p> <p>“Let me get you another shirt,” I said, leaning back against the dresser and resting my hands on the top.</p> <p>“I’m all yours, Lorna. You look great. I have an idea. I want to see your tits before we even get to that hotel.”</p> <p>What the hell - I couldn’t pass up an idea about my tits - that. I smiled at him. It was just another way of being naughty. He wasn’t wearing a dress - he wasn’t even wearing his underwear. His eyes dropped to my tits, which were just aching to be shown. And his dick stiffened some more at the thought. There was a tiny, puffy nipple on my left breast, and the pink peak jutting out of my dark cleavage. I didn’t think he was quite hard enough already, but the idea of him with my body made me so excited. I couldn’t stand the sight of him with the dress hanging lower than I was. I knew I was dripping wet, and my nipples were hard and swollen, too, even with the top of my dress on. He did it, and then, like he did everything, all because he went. I swear. nothing. He made a real. ‘bout he did whatever.
