The marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the ——regiment of infantry, and Miss Jane Bates, had had its</strong> uses.</p> <p>There was nothing more for Jane and Louise's love for Mr. Bates, if only in the world of fucking. Mr. Bates was dead. Jane had made sure of that.</p> <p>It had been Jane's and Louise's time on the battlefield. They had seen it, heard it, and believed it. For them, that was good news.</p> <p>It was time to stop fucking.</p> <p>Mr. Bates had fallen asleep on Louise's knee. Jane and Louise were the last to come downstairs. Mr. Bates' wife was dead.</p> <p>Their wedding night had gone well; Louise in her bridal gown wearing her crown, Jane in her dress, and Mr. Bates in his underpants, ready to mount her. They had made love. They had fucked. It was the first time ever, not just with a boy, but with a man, with a man who made love to their bodies. They had fucked good. They had fucked beautifully.</p> <p>Mr. Bates had cum on Louise. It was her first time ever. He had cum over that. The thought brought an immediate feeling of revulsion.</p> <p>Mr. Bates had also had a good night. They knew. He'd fucked. They hadn't done anything else.</p> <p>Jane and Louise had made wonderful love. They'd made good love. They had enjoyed it. They had enjoyed it to the fullest.</p> <p>Mr. Bates' wife had died, and Jane and Louise got their wedding night together.</p> <p>They had danced and kissed and groped them. They had played games and danced. They had had a good time. It had been very good.</p> <p>They had tried to make it last, had tried to be good. They had tried, and then had kissed and caressed and kissed others. They had been wonderful.</p> <p>Mr. Bates had his hand down Jane and Louise's dress, in the warm folds of their flesh, and they had made love to each other.</p> <p>Jane's and Louise's wedding night had gone well. Mr. Bates' wife had indeed died.</p> <p>The first time, while Jane and Louise had been waiting for the other, Mr. Bates had gone down on her, had her in the bathroom, had her on the counter, had her on the bed, had her in the tub and she had cum on his face. And then there had been a night of lovemaking. It had been a night of lovemaking.</p> <p>Mr. Bates had come a few times, and more.</p> <p>They had come to know what it could be like. That, and the first time they had done it. They had talked and talked and talked, and he'd done exactly what he had told her to do.</p> <p>They were talking, and he had gone down on Jane too, had her on her back, had her on her knees, and had her sucking his dick.</p> <p>It had been Jane's wedding night, and he had come, after he'd had Jane's ass.</p> <p>It had been Jane's first time.</p> <p>It had been Jane's first time and before they ever saw it.</p> <p>He looked up and smiled at her.</p> <p>"Thank you," he said. "You were right ... you're a wonderful woman. You're so beautiful."</p> <p>He kissed her as she lay back on the bed, and took the other person into his arms and held them together, and said, "Thanks, baby, for letting me marry you."</p> <p>"I know, Mr. Bates. I was just kidding, but when you told me you were getting that on film, I thought ... I don't know ... well... I didn't make my first movie with you."</p> <p>"I know, honey. A lot of guys have done that already. I never thought I'd do what I'm doing now without your help.</p> <p>I've made love to your mother every night for the last eighteen months. It's been you first time, for two months. How did you know?"</p> <p>"I'm not some film star; I'm not some fucking high-priced porn star. It's you, Mr. Bates. It's you Mr. Bates. It's me for you. What do you think about me?"</p> <p>He looked at her.</p> <p>"I think ... I'd like to take you home with us, and we'll finish with that. After you've given me my money back."</p> <p>"What's the matter?"</p> <p>"Nothing, just something ... I'm going to give you all your money back, and I'm going to be so happy."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yes, honey. After me with me. No, and your money; nothing else, and ... that is what we've, and that, I, after me," he said.
