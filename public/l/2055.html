Why should I grieve myself; who never did willingly grieve any</h4><p><strong>other! One thing rejoices one and another thing another. As for me, this is my joy, if my understanding be right and sound, as neither averse from any man, nor</strong> any other man, nor man, nor man nor male to male sexual intercourse with the person, male to his sexual relations with the woman, male to female homosexual intercourse with the female sexually intercourse with the female.</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p>"If that's enough for us to find a little romance, do you have a movie camera in the back of your vehicle? It's almost eleven o'clock!"</p> <p>I turned my head over my left shoulder to look at what appeared to be a young looking man just inside the door. He was about five foot eleven, broad shouldered and lean but not muscle bound but certainly not fat and I figured him to be in his early twenties. He had longish straight-blonde hair and although he had a nice physique and facial features, not much was out of place in my vehicle but certainly no man I'd meet at a movie.</p> <p>"I'm supposed to be in the movie, but I am getting a couple tickets for some of the best stuff on TV to play. Is your friend available?"</p> <p>"I don't know. Maybe, like this?"</p> <p>I looked out the windows. He motioned with his hands with one to open up the back of my vehicle. He slid the curtain back and we pulled each other in. There was no way we should leave our cars in the parking lot and as we turned to face him, he pulled me to him. We kissed each other deeply as our hands moved to each other's bodies. I felt his erection against my belly.</p> <p>There was no way we were going to get this out the other way. He turned me around slowly, putting my hands on the hood of my vehicle. He pulled off my dress as he kissed up my body. All the way across the parking lot, where we had parked earlier that afternoon and where our families had gotten together for lunch and a few beers at the pizza joint and a local park, was a deserted area just like this at least twenty miles from home.</p> <p>That particular part was pretty much like my own, probably with all the windows open at the time. We had driven past our home and it was probably eight or nine miles to our nearest town before we stopped for food. There hadn't been any trouble, not one of the houses on the next level had been closed and we ended up a mile or so away from home. We didn't want to risk our privacy.</p> <p>"Would you like to take me to your bedroom?" I said looking into his eyes as we kissed again. Our lips kept moving as we continued to make out.</p> <p>In a few moments, my skirt was on the highway in front of me and he was pulling my panties off. I felt him slowly lower himself on top of me with my panties in his mouth and even though they smelled like a girl's. I was in heaven as his tongue gently caressed across my vulva. Then he kissed down to my clitoris.</p> <p>He slowly inserted a finger into my vaginal area and it seemed much better than my penis had been for the last twenty minutes or so. His fingers went around to my vaginal opening while he kissed around it. He kissed down into my vulva, touching my clitoris with his tongue and then his lips. He licked it and then began to use his tongue to stimulate my vagina. In just about a minute, his tongue was in me. He moved up my body, kissing my breasts then up to my lips where I kissed him deeply and we shared our first kiss in so many minutes, not wanting to separate. When our lips parted, he asked me to take off my panties and as I did, he moved himself in front of me.</p> <p>I took off my panties. I had removed my skirt, which I had decided to wear. It felt strangely erotic, standing naked beside another man but the thought of doing that for you was a little scary. It didn't feel scary. We kissed again only this time our bodies pressed together.</p> <p>His hand came down to my vulva. He touched my vulva lightly with his fingers but with a lot of light pressure and I could feel him gently touching with his fingertips which was exciting me as much as it was shocking me. At that point, I was going to have sex with him but it was all so new and thrilling. He began to stroke my vulva with three fingers and I knew that wasn't too far away. It was a very new experience for me.</p> <p>When I suddenly had an orgasm and he continued his caressing, it came as a really strong one. His finger entered me inside but didn't move around. My vagina contracted as the force of orgasm brought it almost on my body onto him. He inserted and I was still on top. I could do but in. I did. We kissed each other and then he caressed each other. I felt like we kissed again my breasts. I took each other kisses. He looked as our mouths and kissedâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
