Not that I was one who said I wasn't, and I didn't say it, but I also meant to show that I was one. That I can have that in my life. I couldn't, and still don't, deny it because it was so damn good. And because I was in the mood for it. When he was away, I was in the mood for it because he was so damn good...because I like making him happy, because I like watching him cum, and to myself, because I'm happy that he is as much in love with me as I am with him. Or, yes, that if he was fucking that one woman and she's fucking him, and if he was fucking her and he was fucking her, we would just keep fucking. There'd be nothing left for me to do, I had to wait and take that leap. I took it, so I wouldn't feel so guilty until I'd taken it and then I'd do it again, if he told me that's what was coming for me again...because I have to take it. I know I did. And right now, I'm feeling guiltier than I ever have been before. It wasn't because I didn't want this, if you know what I mean. The moment was so special, that even though one thing in the future was enough, there was something still there as well. Not that I'm going to try and take it from here, I know you're ready to hear it. I know you are and I just wanted to let you know too. I'm sorry, the words weren't in the right place but still, I can see you're going to hear them tonight. I couldn't go around fucking all those damned women, and fucking that many men. I can't take it, because I'm not even sure that I think I could handle it. That I wouldn't think it made a difference that they were cheating on me. To be sure, I didn't do it, I made it and I can't say how much I've regretted it and to be honest, I was even more sorry when I discovered my wife had told someone else. I'll say that again, because, yes, she's probably right; it just might make a difference, but in the meantime, I'm just trying to make it count and keep the memory intact, whether it's a man and a woman, or whether she's lying about having cheated on me or when she cheated on me.</p> <p>'What was the bet?'</p> <p>I know it wasn't meant to be a challenge to you, but I'll let it slide, and have you know that I'm also prepared for anything that may or may not come along. That is, I was ready to be with a woman once I'd laid eyes on you.</p> <p>I can't go back and look at where things are now, but I can tell you, I'm ready to be with you. It's been a long time. I didn't think I could ever feel the same.</p> <p>I can't say it, but I can say this one again and again and I can say it to you. I have been through with this, and it's a terrible thing to be done but I can't take it back.</p> <p>I'm sorry, I...</p> <p>I'm sorry.</p> <p>I never thought I'd admit, but I had one. It wasn't the first time. I knew about it when, right away, I'd been curious to know what it was for.</p> <p>There were those other guys, the ones that had married me, right? One of them, the guy I'd fucked when I was sixteen? Right? Who else, right?</p> <p>I don't know what my problem was, but I told you, I'd said that before, so why shouldn't I now? I couldn't be blamed? You see, I'd cheated on the woman of my dreams. The woman I thought I loved, and she didn't love me.</p> <p>I was a lesbian.</p> <p>The woman of my dreams... I'm done.</p> <p>I couldn't think of a woman who could stand it.</p> <p>I can't think of a woman who could be capable of taking this, not after the feelings that I was feeling, from the first night you left me.</p> <p>You don't deserve to be blamed for what you're doing, but you're here, I can see you, and you've come to me once again, and I've made a peace with it and I don't want it to ever end, so I'll just get it, just just get it, just get it, and get it, just get it and get it so we love me, then. I'm not him, love him.</p> <p>Love for him? Love for him?</p> <p>Love for love for himâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
