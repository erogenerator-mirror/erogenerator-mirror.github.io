May not thy mind for all this continue pure, prudent, temperate, just? As a fountain of sweet and clear water, though she be cursed by some stander</strong>-in in the heavens.</p> <p>'I'd be in bed with you,' she'd say, but not in the way that we'd done. You'd stand still in time, and I'd have those clothes. In time. So how long had she known?</p> <p>Oh, oh! She's got a lot of patience she's got.</p> <p>'I'm dreaming the moment I woke,' she'd say.</p> <p>'I'm dreaming the moment I'm awake,' she'd say, but not in the way that you wake.</p> <p>There she was, that smile that made her breasts ache. You'd wake, wake.</p> <p>'I dream the moment I'm awake, ' she'd say, and you'd be in bed with her.</p> <p>'I dream the moment I'm awakened.'</p> <p>So, then we're still asleep.</p> <p>'No it's not like that,' you'd say, but then we'd be in bed, naked in each others arms, face to face, naked in each others mouth, and you'd be in her pussy, her pussy you were dreaming would be in time with me, too. Or you'd wake.</p> <p>'Do you want to know what it is like to dream,' you'd say. It's a good dream. A real dream. You'd dream.</p> <p>'It's like you're not there and I'm dreaming, too,' she'd say.</p> <p>'It's much like that,' and she'd kiss, caress, stroke and squeeze one of your nipples that's been peeking and waiting for more. You'd wake, wake, and wake. You'd have a dream. You'd wake.</p> <p>'I'm dreaming I'm dreaming I'm dreaming you're in my pussy, your pussy, your pussy, your pussy,' you'd say.</p> <p>'What I dreamt was, I dreamed I'm fucking you,' she'd say. 'How do you wake? With your cock, your hard cock?"</p> <p>She'd be in the midst of making love to your cock as she'd wake, of feeling your hard cock in her pussy. 'How do you get home?' or with your cock or yours in her pussy, of feeling it pulsing and throbbing, her pussy clutching you, sucking you down, as she'd wake with her cock inside her, her hands guiding you, guiding you as you sleep. Or you're in her pussy, you're in her pussy. You'd wake as you wake. She'd come awake by the dream of you and she'd wake with her hand in my pussy, fingering me to orgasm, which she did, too. She'd cum. Cum. Cum, for me. She'd cum again, in my pussy, in my pussy.</p> <p>She'd be in the midst of telling you to do things, to have sex, to take her from yourself. To take her. To have sex with her.</p> <p>She'd never said or said that it would be any good to have a man or man but you and you were in a bed with her and she'd sleep with you. I was in a bed with you.</p> <p>In my dreams you're fucking me.</p> <p>'I wake. I know I'm dreaming. I know a lover with a cock is coming into my dreams and you're dreaming I'm fucking you.'</p> <p>'I can't sleep,' she'd say.</p> <p>'Can't sleep?</p> <p>'Can't sleep and you wake up. That's what a dream is. I dream I dream I'm feeling your cock inside me. I dream that you're cock is fucking me.'</p> <p>'The bed,' she'd say, but it's not too late to be dreaming. It feels great, having you in me. It feels nice. It feels wonderful going in.</p> <p>'I dream that I'm fucking you,' she'd say.</p> <p>She's still waking.</p> <p>'I say we don't have plans this weekend and it's Friday,' she'd say.</p> <p>'What? What? It's Friday. It's Friday morning and we'll have a few hours, a few days, an hour or so, to ourselves,' you'd say.</p> <p>'What are we doing? What are we going to do?'</p> <p>'We are going to make love to each other,' she'd say.</p> <p>'That's not what it is. What does that mean?'</p> <p>'It means you're going to be awake for the rest of the weekend and I'm going to be still fucking you,' she'd say.</p> <p></p> <p>'I'm not dreaming,' you're not dreaming,' I'm not dreaming,' I'm not dreaming we're not dreaming what we're not I'm not there.'</p> <p>'What kind of being there's not fucking is not going to be there're not me—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
