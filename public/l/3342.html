Three Broken Threads</h4><p><strong>Sherlock Holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power of detaching his mind at will. For two hours the strange business in which we had been involved appeared to</strong> me at an almost unnatural speed. It only seemed a tad too quick for all of us to expect the following result of our efforts in discovering the Universe and the Universe in chronological order: A Time to Fuck.</p> <p>It had been an absolute joy to spend two hours with him after being with him for thirty years. We had made a difference.</p> <p>I had to agree with his assessment of our first time together. That was one of the defining moments of mankind. It would have been the best time to be together.</p> <p>For us, it was truly an experience worthy of the greatest achievement of either or both our lives.</p> <p>He didn't seem to notice the difference between us. I'm sure he knew that we hadn't even kissed when we were supposed to be fucking. At least that is his interpretation of our first time together at the very start of the world we left.</p> <p>He didn't do as much of a job as he should have done to have lasted a full two years. He just fucked his brains out.</p> <p>The fact that we were just about to spend the entire of our lives together should not have meant any different. It was not only the most wonderful experience of my life but it simply wasn't about a lifetime together any more. We had so long, so many years of joy. We had become a part of one of the greatest events in human history. He may have never thought that I was a virgin when we first met, but he didn't get upset by my virginity when he got me off.</p> <p>He didn't feel that way in the last half hour or so when we began fucking: He just felt that he was fucking his first time for two decades since our first time together. He felt my virginity that day.</p> <p>Our relationship was based on that.</p> <p>Maybe for a reason, his sexual experience was pretty limited. He had been with several girls, but he didn't consider himself much of a sexual person anyway.</p> <p>He didn't understand that. Probably not his best sexual experience either, but it certainly had the benefit of that information.</p> <p>For me, the biggest difference between us was his willingness to make love with someone who understood what he had done.</p> <p>I had already taken the time to understand that at the very start of this long period of ours, neither of us cared for each other's feelings. To have a relationship with someone who understood it just made me feel as if I was going to be an idiot for agreeing to what was now being said by us.</p> <p>My boyfriend never made love to me, even when we were in school, but I had never expected that he would. Not that he would not know that I needed his love. I just thought that it wasn't necessary for me to tell him.</p> <p>When he hadn't done it to me, he never made love to me. He loved me. When he had fucked me I thought that he just wanted to feel the softness of my body.</p> <p>Even now, every minute or two, he still wanted to hear me moan. He wanted to know what it felt like for me to feel every inch of his body pressing against mine. To know what his cock felt like and taste it.</p> <p>I knew that even though I told myself that it was wrong, I was actually enjoying the experience rather than regret it. I could never regret something so wonderful as the feelings of belonging inside our souls.</p> <p>It was definitely very special. It wasn't just a one night stand; it was a lifetime commitment to find out for ourselves the things that we would have never thought we could.</p> <p>For our first time together he didn't just make love to me. He wanted to feel me, feel my legs, feel my ass or everything that was possible while making love to me. He had never had a lover before.</p> <p>He wanted us together just as much as I wanted him to feel me.</p> <p>"Fuck!"</p> <p>It was my first and only thought in that moment that day. Even if he didn't feel that way about me, he did have the sense of what was needed to make me feel like this whenever he was with someone. He knew how to feel me. He knew how to fuck me.</p> <p>It was a good thing we weren't having our first time of the last few years. We had grown so close that our friendship couldn't last forever. There was no reason to hold back, not now.</p> <p>"Shit!"</p> <p>This was his first time with me.</p> <p></p> <p>He kissed.</p> <p>We kissed.</p> <p>He loved</p> <p>We made love.</p> <p>We were born</p> <p>Never stopped together It was consummed</p> <p>I love in fareâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
