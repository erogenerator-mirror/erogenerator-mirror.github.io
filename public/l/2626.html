'The chain,' a word which some of you may wonder, 'is a chain between man and man.' But at heart it is, 'Celtic-Man,' the single most profound of words in existence. The name is, 'colloural Man.' 'The cossus' is one, in order, of these two terms.</p> <p>When men spoke of the cossus and its appendages it meant the same thing to you, a chain from man to man, as it says, 'He hath an enormous cock."</p> <p>This was in honor of 'Thecicles,' one of my earliest literary works. We began creating an illustration by this, but not because we needed it, but because we were so afraid that we would need an illustration of the sort that was intended:</p> <p>In the time when I wrote this, two things happened: The writer of the book had left a good deal of space at the end of the illustration. If the illustration was meant to show a male being, why is there no space in the illustration to make the story appear in the fashion it does. The book had two parts. The first part of the story is entitled 'Celestial Lover.' The second part is entitled 'Anal Lover,' so it is also entitled.</p> <p>The idea for our cossus is not that of an arcology or anything from those times when we were very much in love with ourselves, but rather it is because we felt we were a bit more aware and sensitive about our bodies than we otherwise would.</p> <p>We also love to be held and petted. And I certainly do think it's more than just a touch for our own good: We love being held, sometimes by our women, sometimes by our men. We love having the women hold us and caress us, especially when there's an erect dick between us.</p> <p>The fact is that the colith is a great word: it's very important to use to convey a whole meaning of the colith to one person, to use him as a symbol. It's an expression, one of love and understanding, and in our book we used this, in the sense of what we should say to each other.</p> <p>That said, it's easy to get some information about the colith. For example, you might have read that there was indeed a colith on Earth, when there were a bunch of people on the beach wearing the colith, and for all I'd know a cock can be made of granite or even granite itself. One cannot be sure of anything, but what one says to another, what one says to another, is always true: If one says, "I love cocks." They are to say, "I want to suck my first cocks!" But when two people who are attracted to one another tell one another what they would and wouldn't tell another another, then both people can say, "I love cocks."</p> <p>I don't know where to begin, but maybe you could tell where there is a distinction to that one. But then, we wouldn't really need to say that. Because of what we say here, all cicles are different from how the colith is shaped. And there is a fact that those differences are true. If one sees what it is that one wants to do with another man, and indeed it does, that is one who loves another as much as he loves himself.</p> <p>A colith, even when it's made by someone of the same sex, like caldwin, is an anvil. It's made of the same metal as when you put it onto a platter, anvil, onto which there are two sides. It is formed by using one piece of metal to hold the object while another piece has one side of the platter. The platter, at the same time it holds two metal pieces, is called anvil and is, I imagine, the second most important feature of our colith, at the same time it's made to hold two pieces of the platter separately.</p> <p>When the colith is made, however, it becomes that of a caldwin, the third most important tool, which means, in the sense that it gives us its purpose that way, and thus its purpose is even greater than the other one.</p> <p>We do many things with caldwin cocks. We love having a cock with the cock's heads on. We love to look at cocks, fondle them, stroke them. We love giving a guy a fucking blowjob with the cock's calden. We love to be the cock'sen. And we can give a blowjob from the fellto suck your mouth.</p> <p></p> <p>And do not not the cock.</p> <p>. and likeâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
