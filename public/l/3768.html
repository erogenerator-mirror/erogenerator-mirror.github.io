That was in stark contrast what happened next.</p> <p>Lizzie's heart raced as it seemed that somehow, somehow, the man between her legs was fucking her. The girl's body tensed, held in place only by her arms as her eyes flashed up and the man buried his face in her breasts, his tongue flicking across the tip of her nipple then slowly sucking and lashing it between his teeth, sending chills all the way through her.</p> <p>In her lustful and confused striptease moment of weakness she knew the girl would not be able to resist the man. She'd come so hard, so ready, so utterly, so utterly... she was in such a precarious state, a helpless creature on a point of no return.</p> <p>The man was fucking her in the bed of the Victorian house, as it happened.</p> <p>"Halt!" she growled at him with a moan of despair and fear in her voice.</p> <p>"Are you still there love?" the man asked her in a hushed breathy tone, but with a touch too high for any normal conversation. It seemed strange to know that he was so intimately connected with her, it seemed strange and unprofessional to address her with the words that did not even occur to her. That it was she. That she loved him. That it was wrong to love him like that.</p> <p>"Yes," she said as the man's tongue lashed her neck and she almost screamed with frustration and fear, trying to speak against the sensations he'd caused.</p> <p>"Are you still there?" He did not answer verbally; merely held her hips and started to move in a figure eight, where he was penetrating deeper with each movement.</p> <p>Lizzie almost felt his hard dick enter her mouth as he entered, and felt even more of her body take over, and then, as he moved deeper into her she became aware of everything for the first time since their first session of unbridled sexual activity, her husband being in her mouth rather than fucking her on the bed of the Victorian mansion.</p> <p>"Do you still want me to fuck you in your tight little cunt? " he asked, thrusting his hips forward so that the swollen head of his dick pushed into the wetness of her belly. "Yes! Fuck me with your hard pussy," he added at length.</p> <p>"Yes!" Lizzie growled at him and then felt as the walls of her pussy sucked in on his dick head, sucking it in deeper than any man.</p> <p>She'd been a virgin when they began. A girl who had made love to a man.</p> <p>Her vagina stretched to accommodate him, accommodating his penis... to accommodate how long he'd been fucking her. It would not be wrong; surely. "Yes!" she moaned. "You love me. You dirty bastard!"</p> <p>It was what men had done to her. He could make her do things only he'd ever done to her before. They had fucked her. They did things only they'd never done before. They'd kissed her, touched her face, her hair... to her toes, and then, after the two of them had been through their mutual sexual exertions, he'd used her so thoroughly that no more than an hour had passed by time had passed when he'd cum inside her and left her to sleep, knowing that she loved him as much as she loved him now.</p> <p>That had been the night, the one thing he'd told her she didn't have to know to be sure she was ready to love a man and not a woman. Not any more.</p> <p>"You've been waiting for this haven't you? " he'd asked.</p> <p>"Yes!" she moaned at the memory of that night and that night and that night after the two were finished. "Fuck me. I wanna come. I want you..."</p> <p>And she'd had.</p> <p>Lizzie had been with men. But this man was different. This man didn't have the experience of fucking her. It was not like he'd ever been a man, and was not much of a lover. There was no doubt he would find all this sexy and seductive, he knew she'd come. He knew she'd never been satisfied even if she'd wanted to; that she was completely at his mercy. When he was finished fucking her, he'd pulled out. His cock was wet from her come and his come was oozing out onto her belly as she looked him in the eye.</p> <p>Now he was fucking her, fucking her with no finessems, his cock. Fuck her in her body and not the other way. As she didn't even the woman could be able to know what the way she'd have been fucked, fucking.
