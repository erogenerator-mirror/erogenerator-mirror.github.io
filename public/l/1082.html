The sexiest of all women has the most wonderful and wonderful husband, or boyfriend, who can satisfy her; as often as he can.</p> <p>But all the sex I can think of, can you imagine? No?</p> <p>In the old days of the internet, where you can see pictures, I've seen so many pictures of naked women that can be downloaded from the Internet. If I'm not honest, you'd really know how hard I'm trying to remember pictures, because, when the sun was supposed to rise in England, every night when I'm not looking at a picture of naked women, I'd just start playing with my cock, hoping, praying that someone might, in some way, be interested in joining the website. I'm never a believer in masturbation, because even though there's much in the way of pornography, there's so much to be said about some sex act, whether or not that it is real, and whether or not it is really happening, you can always hope someone to join in.</p> <p>This whole, all the talk of sex is just such a waste of time. If I was a man, I'd take on my life if I could, be it only to be with a woman who wanted me, a woman who wanted me as much, if not more, than I wanted her (I mean what difference can it make when I'm in the presence of a beautiful, sensual woman). And if I had sexual urges as a man, I'd be all too willing to make a play for someone who wanted me to be part of their lives.</p> <p>It's my decision whether to be with her or not.</p> <p>As I said, I've been doing some reading around the Internet. I'd be willing to join one of the websites if it's all right with reading about the lives of women who want to be with men. But what is this? Is it that I can read about sex, or even about a woman who wanted I'd like to join a friend's sex chat group, and who liked men?</p> <p>It sounds a little weird. To tell you the truth, I'm not particularly interested in getting sex, but I'd like to help someone find what they, maybe, like sex, are looking for in a woman.</p> <p>There are women I knew growing up, who wanted the same things I feel like I do, and who have such amazing sex lives. That's why I choose to be with women.</p> <p>Myself, I've told you there are a lot of people who want to talk about sex. If you find me to be the greatest sex partner you ever had, you must be curious about the kinds of things a man should ask, things men should ask. Is this a lot of women, or for other women as well, like in your own sex life, as well as mine?</p> <p>I am a very passionate reader. I read many erotic stories, read an essay from one of my fellow Lit-Editor friends, a woman who is not a fan of the male gender, and a man who seems not to be interested in the female gender. I'd like to join this website, if I can, I can chat with a very attractive woman who like women, and chat with a lady who like men.</p> <p>It's been a few months since then, since I last visited this site, who knows? Maybe it's too early in the year that women will be so much more interested in sex than men? Perhaps it's too early to start a conversation about sex with a woman? I wish I were there, but I don't have a lot, so I don't bother answering that.</p> <p>I'm really looking for an introvert. To be honest, even I don't know myself, but I was just a short while ago chatting with one of my friends, her name is Melissa. There she was, and my conversation with her was fun. It is always a turn-back to the past, for me to talk with my friend about sex, to learn about her sexual fantasies. So many things that I have in common with men, and a woman, they don't have all about what I ever thought was that I could do.</p> <p></p> <p>But I could never have in common with men, even, women.</p> <p></p> <p>To have made love that which I can only like to the good—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
