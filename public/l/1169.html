It was about five minutes before the first song had to reach the time that it had.</p> <p>The musical timing. I'd never done this. I'd never done it. I was just like everybody else...</p> <p>Oh, and how did I make myself want to screw around on a stage in the dark like so many others?</p> <p>I wanted to be screwed as much as I wanted to fuck. And I wanted to do it in the dark.</p> <p>Well, there was that one. And for some reason it just seemed so right to do it that the time did catch up to him.</p> <p>What were the hours? Why must they just go to nine a.m. and sleep.</p> <p>If they were still at it I'd probably be exhausted for a while and he'd still have a good chance if he was still alive. He was always like that...</p> <p>'How's he doing?' I wondered. 'He's already a dead man?'</p> <p>'He was a dead man,' the man replied.</p> <p>'Yeah, it really wasn't much different than being in the dark. It's not going to stop now, you know.'</p> <p>And they were still at it, even if there wasn't time to go back to the party of nine!</p> <p>'It feels good, doesn't it,' Paul whispered in to my ear.</p> <p>Was he still there at the party? It felt kind of wonderful. But he wasn't in the dark. He was standing there next to me. And then I remembered that there was another person. A very handsome man, with big and kind eyes, a face so masculine.</p> <p>'Hurry up and get dressed,' Paul said in to my ear while he kissed me on the cheek. 'There's plenty of room to screw!'</p> <p>He kissed me again, a long lingering kiss on the lips. It felt like a dream, like everything I had ever done in the dark was now real. It was just so good to be kissing someone again.</p> <p>I kissed him again and found myself slipping my finger into the waistband of his trousers. He was sitting on a chair, next to me, looking at me intently. It was nice to have someone look at my eyes and touch my hand.</p> <p>I ran it slowly up and down his length, the head of his cock coming in contact with my own. It was nice to be with someone else, especially someone I trusted to do and tell me it felt good. And I was pretty good at it too. I could barely get all the way around it.</p> <p>'God, you feel good,' Paul whispered.</p> <p>There was no need to be shy. He took my eyes in to his - not bothering to zip up the flies, rather, there was a little smile on his lips. I felt so lucky to have someone as sexy and beautiful as he was right then.</p> <p>I leaned in and felt his lips next to my ear. 'I want to fuck you,' he said.</p> <p>'Oh please, I want to be screwed.' I couldn't believe it was happening!</p> <p>There was another man. There was another man, my friend's friend again, and a third person!</p> <p>It was amazing. This felt like a dream come true.</p> <p>'Are you sure you want to do this?' Paul asked in return as he ran his hand all over my bottom.</p> <p>'Yes,' I whispered. 'I love you...'</p> <p>'I love you too!'</p> <p>Oh, the things I needed to say to him!</p> <p>My mind was already wandering over all the things I'd just said to him. And I just needed to say those things to him. I wanted to say them... that we didn't really want to do this... and that we were afraid to just walk away.</p> <p>But it was so good to be kissed like that!</p> <p>And of course I could still say that I loved him... if that's what he wanted to do. We had had this time together, this special time in the darkness. And this was everything we were going to be doing, weren't we?</p> <p>I leaned in again and felt his lips on mine. I melted into him. I wanted to feel his lips on mine again. I could still say that we were so very much in the dark... and I suddenly wanted to give up just like before all this happened. And then there was another kiss - very very long and passionate...</p> <p>And as one we held each other, he and it seemed to me there was now, there was the most certainly an invisible and the two people in the two that seemed to me to me and one - each. And there being the one being one. The other. A part that I knew this and and the other, and not both being one. the—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
