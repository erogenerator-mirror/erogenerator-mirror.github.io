Whatsoever thou dost affect, whatsoever thou dost project, so do,</h4><p><strong>and so project all, as one who, for aught thou knowest, may at this very present depart out of this life. And as for death, if there be any gods,</strong> I say, because, for the first time in many centuries, I do not feel the needling of death, I should go on in my life to be in the mortal world, as the day of the Dead begins. And I've chosen not to go on. In a most fitting way, I must live that life in the face of everything that is to come on our way into eternity. But then it's as if one's existence is so very matter of fact, that this very reality is just possible to come out like a wave as a single wave upon ocean tide, that even the most unkempt of man's dreams will never go as they did before.</p> <p>FIVE.</p> <p>The endâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
