O my soul, the time I trust will be, when thou shalt be good, simple,</h4><p><strong>single, more open and visible, than that body by which it is enclosed. Thou wilt one day be sensible of their happiness, whose end is love, and their affections dead</strong>.</p> <p>For now, the thought of their coupling made a bit more acceptable -- if a bit more interesting.</p> <p>"I want to make love to your ass," She told me, her lips now gently pressed against mine.</p> <p>"Well..." I started to say more than anything else, but then, the words were lost forever to me, "But first, you need to be prepared to be my first white bitch."</p> <p>I took her back in my arms.</p> <p>"Ohhh, honey," she said, kissing me back so passionately I almost didn't know she had done that any time I'd mentioned this to her. Her hands then began exploring me over my shirt, kneading my butt and pulling me tight against her.</p> <p>Even with the shirt off, I had to resist the urge to touch myself all over. Not that I had a lot of personal time to do so. It'd never crossed my mind - or should I say, my imagination - to have one of those situations happen spontaneously one day when I had the chance to get close to her. I think that may have been the first indication of how we were going to handle the things we were about to do.</p> <p>"I'm all yours, baby," she purred, pressing her body tightly against mine and sliding her hand up and down my back, occasionally running her fingers up and down between my ass cheeks. I tried taking the plunge, but the heat in the room was more than just the heat from her pussy which I'd just been so well lubricated.</p> <p>"Oh. Sorry!"</p> <p>She quickly pulled her hand out of my ass and looked me in the eyes. "Don't be."</p> <p>She ran a finger down my cheek and into my hole. "Oh, God, honey, I forgot, I shouldn't have done that! I'm just not sure I like it."</p> <p>We kissed once more, and her hand soon left its place, but then she returned to stroking my pussy, moving her fingers over my clit, pushing them deep in my cunt. I was already coming already -- in fact, before my orgasm had even come upon me.</p> <p>She withdrew her fingers from my hole as soon as they were covered in my own juices.</p> <p>"No, honey, I want it, I want you. I want your first white ass fucking. Can you do that for me?" she asked, a small smile still appearing on her lips. I nodded, and her tongue replaced her fingers for the first time. I reached out with my other hand again and grabbed her ass, trying to pull her closer as I felt it tremble for her.</p> <p>She put her hand back on my cunt and rubbed herself gently, but then leaned forward in the doorway of my bedroom. I leaned my head back and waited for her to take my anal virginity.</p> <p>"You ready for it, baby?" she breathed.</p> <p>I nodded again, unable to say anything other than "Yes!" as I felt her lips close over my virgin hole and begin to lick and suck it into existence, pushing my pussy against her face.</p> <p>In my heart, I remember how much of a turn on I got from that first kiss. There was simply more to it, and the feelings I got from that first tongue-wrestled tongue of hers that first time together seemed to last forever to me. It was as though every sense in my whole being was centred on my pussy.</p> <p>She kissed the center of my canal and rubbed it, causing my ass to twitch, then her tongue went back to work upon my opening again. Her tongue probed deeper this time, but I guess she was able to taste the pre-cum of my cunt. In this way, she could taste how excited I was to be used by a woman. And she'd just do it for me, too.</p> <p>"Oh, God, you are a good cunt licker, honey. And your cunniness is so good," I moaned into her pussy, my head thrown back and my arms hanging limp, my legs still wrapped around her and squeezing her as she worked my anus with her thumb and two fingers. We still held each other's gaze and she smiled at me, then leaned in and licked my cunt.</p> <p>"Yeah, baby, you like my cunt licking, don't ya'?" she cooed.</p> <p>My body betrayed me with excitement.</p> <p>"Mmm-hmm."</p> <p>I was beyond excited by the sensation of that first lick, but I think the whole idea of being used as a bitch was having an effect on me for the first time. I don't think they'd ever told us we were gay, but, "Be sure, it's you who this or that."</p> <p>I took my cunt licked her as many fingers to be fucked. And I came for my ass, and my assâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
