One might have</strong> feared he was going to be the one to fuck her. Now if you believed that a man is supposed to be made to be fucked, then you would be wrong.</p> <p>For a boy, with his mane mop to his ears, his brown hair streaked with grey strands, and his deep brown eyes dark enough to be difficult to see through with the moonlight flickering lazily over his skin you saw a man that could fuck in two places at a time. He was tall and thick and hung heavily over her but he was also fucking hard enough to beat her. The contrast in blood-red and green with his dark skin made you want to grab a hold of the bastard and shove him away like a lunatic. He must have been feeling sorry for her because he looked at it as if she were one of those "the good girl", which was why they were doing this! But surely he didn't care about her virtue because he was fucking her as if she was an animal. This was even more than two people doing their thing in the bedroom but in the dark it felt so much like two people doing whatever they wanted out of bed!</p> <p>Now it was his turn to fuck her and the moment he entered her she felt the pressure build in her core and then she started to cum. He had fucked her more than once in her day and night but still he'd lost himself in her, only he still felt that wonderful moment of intimacy from day to night. There was only one real difference in this moment: she didn't feel the tension within him as she had felt before. He wasn't even trying to fuck her, he knew how best to please himself. He simply wanted to fuck her. He loved her and wanted to fuck her every day since he was born.</p> <p>"Oh god," she almost said. "I'm coming," she said to him in a high voice.</p> <p>"Don't you dare," he replied. He was only partly aware of her vocalization and the tightness of her internal walls closing themselves over his cock. It was almost as if she were trying to hold his blood inside her by sucking him down inside her until she couldn't feel him anymore. But he had not yet come so she thought she'd made a breakthrough somewhere. He couldn't hold back even if he'd wanted to and this sensation was enough to make him feel like he might pass out when he finally started to ejaculate. The fact that he didn't even seem to be aware of her vocalization when he just kept coming made her realize that it was her first real cock-to-cock fuck in her life. And the sight of it was even better than she imagined.</p> <p>The sound of her voice while he was coming made the whole thing even more exciting. She was completely unaware of her lover's condition due to her pleasure and her sudden change of expression. She saw all of the joy and joy and joy because the moment he was coming, her body felt it, but it also felt some way less than her earlier climax. She really felt it, which was even better than the one she had just experienced in herself. She just loved the moment. In this moment she didn't even know that she was making love with her lover.</p> <p>"Please! Oh god," she said to him in another high voice. "Oh please!"</p> <p>"Good." He didn't hear the word she'd whispered. He merely didn't hear it, but he would later. Later when you're ready to get fucked, he wanted to keep fucking her until he'd come. He just wanted to come in her. He wanted her to feel it and feel it while she was still so open to him.</p> <p>"Please! I'm coming," she said again. And it ended that way too. When her climax swept through her she almost screamed. It was so much better than if he had just pulled himself out a little and left her lying there, the full head of his cock still lodged inside her while she hung suspended in the air her legs wide open and his head just barely penetrating her.</p> <p>He had just cum so much and so many times in her and with her and with her. But her orgasmic feeling of power over him, and then her body's sudden pleasure, was more than he remembered to be in her before and it made it feel even better when he made love more. When he finally came to her, her body seemed to have lost its energy and she felt something about him that she never felt about anyone before. This was love and, in her mind, the power that the man had over her. It was like a woman possessed, but there was no mistaking the way it made one feel about a woman.</p> <p>When she finally came back she felt the rush and then how much stronger, she thought that she wasn't just the strength of the power of her lover, it had made her feel. She didn't have to be like any.
