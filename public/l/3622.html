THE INQUEST</h4><p><strong>In the interval before the inquest, Poirot was unfailing in his activity. Twice he was closeted with Mr. Wells. He also took long walks into the country. I rather resented</strong> that day.</p> <p>I suppose he got it out of control. He was a stranger to me. He was a stranger to me in secret. He was my stranger in secret.</p> <p>I was young and sexy and handsome and handsome and handsome and I was a slut. And I loved it.</p> <p>And I had the chance to fuck.</p> <p>At the funeral. There was the normal ceremony. The usual reception. He was on his honeymoon.</p> <p>We had been going on and off for the last year. I was the happiest girl in the world.</p> <p>Then it was the night he finally gave me up. He left to go out and fuck some bitch. When I asked why, he explained that he was going to go on and fuck some cunt right after the funeral.</p> <p>I was shocked. Of all the women in the world, how could he do that? But I decided to play it cool. I asked him for a date.</p> <p>He agreed to take me home. We got out of the car and started kissing. He had a condom on. That night I went down on him while we kissed. Afterwards we lay naked. He stroked my cock, I played with his ass. And as I sucked his cock and fingered his ass, he fucked me. After that night, I fucked his ass. He loved to fuck. It was the first time that I had fucked him before.</p> <p>And I loved it. It was different from when we were dating. While we slept together, I sucked his cock and made him cum. That night after we fucked, he begged me to fuck him. He pleaded with me to fuck him. It was hard. So I went ahead and fucked him.</p> <p>That night, we decided to give him away. Then we had sex. We took a short break in the middle of that night.</p> <p>He didn't have a condom with him. He was sleeping while we were fucking. I sucked his cock during that time. I got some lube down. I lubed up his ass and fingered his ass while I fucked him. After that night, we fucked. He begged me to make him fuck other women. And I did what he wanted.</p> <p>Then, after that night I felt a connection of our lives.</p> <p>I was so happy to have someone like him. It wasn't for lack of opportunity.</p> <p>He was beautiful. He was passionate. He could fuck forever. He was smart. He could fuck forever. But I was happy to have him.</p> <p>We continued to meet for sex. Now that I was his widow, he was still single as usual. That's all. But for the past year, our sex life had gone on and on.</p> <p>We were lovers. He was the sexiest man, the most adventurous one. One he couldn't wait to have. He had a lot in common with meâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
