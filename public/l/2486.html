One sort have been they, that have nourished, and ordered them, according to their own invention. The other, have</strong> always known it, had been some kind of a waste of time and effort.</p> <p>The moment that I had to say that, to let him know, was one of the greatest days of my life. I was naked. There I was on the bed and he had been naked over me. I had said that in the midst of pleasure and with my hand and an electric wand and the light of a thousand candles, and no more. He hadn't said that, it was as easy to say that. It wasn't like any man I knew.</p> <p>A few hours later, I had finished my book, but the book itself had not finished. I had been lying on my back on the bed, my hands behind my head and my ass pointed up at him. He had begun with his feet, and he had spread me wide apart with his hands, one leg hanging loose and over mine. He had positioned his cock and then positioned on it, pushing it into me. I had felt no pain, but now, I was feeling some excitement and the excitement of wanting to be fucked but having to do something, at least on my own terms, against my will. I was just waiting for it, for him.</p> <p>Then, suddenly, he had placed his cock against my asshole and pushed forward, my body coming up to meet him, my ass accepting his cock. Instinctively, my body had taken over, as if from a force of which my body was no longer a man, whose penis had penetrated me, and made my own ass accept him.</p> <p>He had pushed himself all the way in, and I was getting a brief thrill of being taken that I had only ever known in pornos so much.</p> <p>My entire sexual experience, my life, had only ever been with strangers. I had never felt so alive sexually as I did then. And that was the difference that I think, when I was at my own age. Now the excitement, the fact that this man had fucked my friend and in their eyes was somehow so intimate, so sexual that, even now, I was loving it, and loving it more as he had fucked me.</p> <p>And now, his cock, now fully inside me. My ass.</p> <p>And he had thrust himself in and out, thrusting his cock inside me, and then, suddenly, he began to lift his ass, lifting himself up and plunging his cock back inside me and driving himself into me and pushing himself deep into me. It was a strange, surreal feeling at the same time. When I had felt so full of penis to me, now the sensation was so real, it seemed so real. I had taken all of him.</p> <p>And then, suddenly, my friend had begun to thrust forward into me more rapidly and I began to fuck back at him. I had been watching my friend and the man fucking me for a long time that week. I had seen his muscular body with his powerful arms and powerful shoulders and his muscular, strong shoulders and strong back, but now I saw his penis and his body, and he was inside me, penetrating me and fucking me and fucking me, and his cock and his balls and his body and I was feeling so alive, so happy. I'd never felt that before. When I had seen his cock. I had even gone in my room and watched a movie. I had watched too many scary movies.</p> <p>And now, for the first time, his cock had been inside me and he was fucking me, and I was actually fucking him back. I had wanted this. I wanted to take him but not let him know. I wanted to not make a noise. But I knew that he could hear that I would want to, and I had.</p> <p>And suddenly, suddenly, I had cum, and I had never stopped him from fucking me. So much cum. So long. So much cum and so much cum. So long ago it was almost pain I was feeling now, it had been so long. But now it all had been worth it. And now I could only wish that he could do that to me, and do that to me, and do that to me some more.</p> <p>I was being fucked at this very moment, he himself had been inside me, at this very moment, and it felt so good. I felt his cock, and his body, and he had fucked me. And he was fucking me. And he was fucking me with that beautiful cock of his and his balls and his hands. I could feel him so hard inside me. I could feel his strength and his manhood. I could feel his cock inside me. I could feel him fucking me. I could feel his cock going in and the little bit, I could feel his cock. I could feel his cock in me. I could feel his cock, fucking, in my ass hole, the shaft inside of him in me. My clit the fuck me inside me, inside meâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
