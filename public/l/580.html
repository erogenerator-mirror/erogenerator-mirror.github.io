He felt the two men and the group behind him. He could still see them. The men had been transformed into men. He recognized them among the men but they were all looking his way. They were no more than ten feet in front of him. He felt something he wasn’t expecting on this front. There were two of those men on the ground below him. He felt a sharp slap or a pain, some sort of roughness, on his ass. At first he felt hurt.</p> <p>He didn’t react.</p> <p>It was time to take things to the next level. He knew that the men on the ground below him would be rough with him. But he still wanted to make it as smooth a battle as possible. He needed the men above him, on their knees, their heads bowed, their hands behind their backs, and their cocks out, begging. He didn’t want to think of how it must be an ordeal for him to be used or humiliated. But this was a way of giving pleasure and satisfaction to those he loved.</p> <p>For the next several minutes he was not afraid. He was doing his manly duty. The men above him were not afraid of him.</p> <p>The two men came to his sides. One of them knelt behind Pierre. The other moved in front of him and knelt in front of Pierre. A hand reached down, took him by the cock and guided him to the ground. He felt the hand on his dick but it moved away. The last man knelt in front of his cock. He pushed against Pierre’s head. He reached out and took hold of Pierre’s dick. He pumped in time with the two men who had given him such pleasure. Pierre came and came. The men cheered him on. They applauded his obedience as he had done for their pleasure.</p> <p>As he lay there, gasping for breath, his dick was still rock hard. He heard the men above ask "How’d you like us?"</p> <p>Pierre answered "It was lovely, all of it." It’s only then that his memory came back.</p> <p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p> <p>Pierre woke with a start, a shivery feeling between his legs. This thing had happened. It was not what he had intended, it was more. It was like he had become a part of a dream. If this could truly exist he thought, he’ll never be the same.</p> <p>He felt a tongue on his lips and a cock at the opening of his mouth. He opened his mouth for his mate and felt it move inside, pushing and sliding in. The man on his cock pushed, he moved his head back again. Pierre was sure it could do this. But his thoughts were interrupted, suddenly he felt cold, like something was poking against his bottom. Slowly he opened his eyes to see what happened. He immediately saw a shadow move towards him. He looked down to where the cock which had slid into him had reached the entrance of his asshole. He saw the cock he loved being the recipient of.</p> <p>Pierre raised his head and saw his dick hanging there.</p> <p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p> <p>In the shadows above his cage Pierre remembered that they were going to fuck him. Pierre remembered what was going to happen to him. But he couldn't move. He couldn't escape. He couldn't get his mind off the situation. It couldn’t help but feel the heat of desire between his legs.</p> <p>As Pierre was lying on his back and lying on his side, facing the cage door, he was naked, save for a leash attached to the collar around his neck. His cock was still stiff as he could remember it taking control of him almost a year earlier. He felt totally at their mercy.</p> <p>The two men behind him, they were still kneeling behind him. The one on his back, their hands on his chest, their cocks were on the floor.</p> <p>Pierre was being raped.</p> <p>- - - - - - - - - - - -</p> <p>Two men stood at the door of the cage. They had already taken off their robes and were nude. One man walked into the cage, pushing two more together so their cocks were a little bigger.</p> <p>Pierre’s eyes were wide. He’s wanted the same thing, what more is there? He couldn’t move. He couldn’t escape. It was too scary. The moment of truth. There was no stopping him. He just needed to go along with what came to get by it.</p> <p></p> <p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - — - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
