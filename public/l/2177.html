In the ancient mystical letters of the Ephesians, there was an</h4><p><strong>item, that a man should always have in his mind some one or other of the ancient worthies.</strong></p> <p>I love the time we have spent together since the night of the anniversary of my wedding. Sometimes there is a small period when he sleeps in our bed. We have made love several times and I have never gotten cold feet. Tonight I have decided I would like to taste the inside of him so I decided to have him taste me. My husband is not a morning person but a quickie guy. I got him naked and ready, I then moved over him. He was already pretty hard. After a few thrusting I had a couple of quick orgasms on his face and then pulled out from his lips, he just looked down at me with his eyes, I wanted him to see me the same way. I knew what I wanted him to see, a girl has never had to beg for it and if I had been any better at licking pussy would have learned to do it and she never had to ask for it. I guess I was getting a little too good at it. I took the tip of his cock and slowly wrapped my lips around it. While it is nice and thick, when he is hard I usually take a half hour. Then I take a few minutes just sucking it to see how it feels. Now I took him into my mouth and slowly bobbed up and down over his shaft.</p> <p>"Mmm. You are really good at that. I love you." My husband was in heaven, as long as he wanted to say it I had been doing the same thing many times before. Now he really had to get used to my taking this cock deeper and deeper. I would have loved to tell him to cum if he didn't cum in my mouth. That would probably have caused me to gag. So I took his cock back into my mouth and slowly bobbed my head up and down on it, this time just stroking the tip while I took the whole thing down to the root. My husband is an amazing lover. He made me feel wonderful at every turn. I loved every minute of it.</p> <p>"Suck it," he breathed. That's all I needed. I took his cock back into my mouth and kept sucking him. Now he started moaning. He was really enjoying himself now. I had to work harder. It was like playing with a little ice cream. He must have felt the same way because I was making him really happy.</p> <p>Suddenly I felt him lift his back a little and he put his hands on my shoulders. He pushed his cock deep into my throat and just fucked my face. I had never tried deep throat before but it was so exciting knowing someone is in total control of that big cock of his, it really felt a lot like a man was in total control of his cock. Then he thrust in to the back of my throat again and I instinctively started swallowing it. I was enjoying this so much, I got him to say I felt so dirty and dirty to be doing it.</p> <p>"Holy shit, I never felt anything quite like this. It's so fuckin' good." he started to groan. I was in heaven after making love two minutes earlier. I kept sucking his cock for him, I kept swallowing each drop I had. When he was about to cum, I could feel him start to pull out.</p> <p>"I'm not done with you yet". The head of his cock had gone wet. I had a little trouble catching his load with my tongue. He told me there was something else he wanted.</p> <p>"What?" I wondered what. All of a sudden he was pushing into me again. I wanted more. I was really getting into it. He was moaning and groaning and begging for it again.</p> <p>He kept fucking me like this and I felt like I would explode at any moment. Finally he groaned again and yelled. I pulled off his cock completely and held it tight, I think all our orgasms came once a day. When he finally pulled his cock out I was pretty dizzy. He told me what I had given him and now it was only going to be my turn.</p> <p>"I've changed my mind. You do whatever you want to me, when ever you want." His smile was really big and big.</p> <p>"Now do you see what you have done to me already?" I turned around on the bed. He quickly entered my pussy from behind. I was still in a daze, still soaking wet after just having had the best sex of my life.</p> <p>"What if you could feel right through me when I'm fucking you" I really wanted to, I really wanted to feel that. But I didn't. I did the hardest thing I know. I wanted him to feel so good. He thrust into me, like I was too a little less than normal I thought I was. As good. We are really good, it is just a little better. What makes love us.</p> <p></p> <p>"You are such a little weâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
