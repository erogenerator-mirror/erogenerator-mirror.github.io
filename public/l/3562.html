No Stephen Blackpool. Where was the man, and why did he not come back? Every night, Sissy went to Rachael’s lodging, and</strong> he went home, and fucked her without giving a shit, and then took a nap before he left.</p> <p>As she walked to the back door of her room, she picked out something to wear. It was an old school tie-on shirt with a white shirt tie. And what better way to keep up with her new role-playing boyfriend?</p> <p>When Sissy opened the door, she found the shirt she was wearing on her.</p> <p>“Wow... you really look sexy in that,” Sissy thought to herself, smiling at the dress and all.</p> <p>And what a dress! It was black with black leather pants, with a black belt and black hat, and a matching black jacket.</p> <p>She smiled and stood in front of him, and then she pulled him in for a quick kiss, before she closed the door of the room behind them.</p> <p>“Sissy, do you really wear this to meet your new lover? Please don't tease me anymore!” she giggled. “Or should I say girlfriend?”</p> <p>When he entered the room, the shirt he wore and the pants she wore were gone. The tie-on shirt was a bit too short for her, and her white shorts were gone too. They were just gone too, but Sissy wasn’t surprised that the pants too were worn by her new lover.</p> <p>She closed the door behind him and stepped forward. She wrapped her arms around him and kissed him. They kissed passionately, their tongues fencing and dancing all around each other’s mouths. Sissy felt her own pussy get wet, almost dripping. When she wrapped her arms around his neck, he turned her around and kissed her neck. He kissed her breasts and she felt him licking the skin below her collarbone, his lips touching her nipples.</p> <p>Sissy moaned when she felt his tongue licking at her nipple, then he bit it lightly, just hard enough to cause a small sting. She felt the wetness of her wet pussy and nipples leaking onto her shorts. She moaned again when he kissed her neck and sucked her nipples softly at the same time.</p> <p>As he sucked her nipples and his hands rubbed and pressed at her, he nibbled at her neck and shoulders. Then he kissed down her neckline, licking there as he slowly lowered the collar of her shirt.</p> <p>Sissy felt him licking it.</p> <p>Her arms came up and he kissed and sucked at the skin below her collarbone, down her breast. Then down to her belly, which he licked and sucked. Sissy felt him licking the bottom of her naval, making her shudder with desire. His mouth came in contact with the thin belt of her pants, while Sissy felt his hands sliding down her stomach, through the waistband of her pants, and finally pushing them down her legs. Sissy sighed and moaned as he finally kissed his way to her inner thighs. Sissy felt his tongue sliding through her legs as he kissed down to her crotch. “Oh, I...” she moaned when she felt his mouth pressing on her sex, licking at her pussy lips.</p> <p>“Sissy, do you want more of me? I have been missing this. I wanted to be there.” He was kissing her crotch, moving his body all the way up hers. “Sissy, is this what you wanted? You wanted me all over, now go ahead and have some more fun, you naughty little whore.” His voice was soft, sexy and sexy. Sissy couldn’t believe he was giving her a massage.</p> <p>“Oh God, yeah, you naughty boy, that feels soooo good.”</p> <p>And he went down upon her, his hands sliding up and down her sides as he kissed her, licking at her.</p> <p>He held her head with her hair in his hands, pulling her head back and forth as he took each of her breasts.</p> <p>“Oh! Sissy, they feel so good! I think I am going to fucking die, I am just about to explode. Sissy, you are so wet! So wet!”</p> <p>One hand pulled the bra up, as the other fondled her breast while he sucked hard on her nipple. Sissy moaned and begged for him to lick inside her, to tongue her pussy.</p> <p>Without stopping, he licked up her lips, slowly, making Sissy’s juices flow, until he stopped, and he kissed at her, and then began sucking her, and she felt his tongue working her, and not like she thought. She felt it was going inside her clitoris his tongue.</p> <p></p> <p>like his tongue. like her cock.</p> <p>like his sucking like all like me sucking like him sucking. Sisssses</p> <p>so. it.
