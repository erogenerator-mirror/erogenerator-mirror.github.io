She was no less desirable for her mother's love, and especially her daughter's love, as they both saw their world through new eyes.</p> <p>I fucked her until she begged me not to. I had my cock in her vagina when I wanted to, but there were other parts of me. When she was ready, she had wanted a lot of it before she'd left the house and the girls left for her home. That was going to happen that night, to be sure, with her little body. She'd wanted it, but not here at the moment, so I wasn't going to risk it. Marianne was beautiful.</p> <p>I thought of every girl I'd fucked last night and thought about doing it again. But I'd never had the chance; I wasn't quite ready to even try, unless she could convince me the right way to try. Marianne was beautiful. Now I was determined to give her the love she deserved.</p> <p>I fucked her until she screamed and climaxed with orgasm after orgasm. If anything, it got even better, having her pussy contract around my cock, and making me ejaculate in her vagina. I didn't go soft inside of her, just continued fucking for the rest of the evening. I just kept on fucking until I could no longer hold back.</p> <p>The problem was that I wanted to last, and I didn't want to rush it. I wanted to fuck Marianne's little brains out, so I did. After making love to my wife, I knew my strength would not be nearly as strong once I left her, and that might just be too much. I pulled out of Marianne, leaned back against the chair, and got on my knees to fuck her.</p> <p>When I was as hard as I was going to get, and it was a lot harder than before, I stood up to move. Marianne, I think, realized I was going to shoot my seed while fucking her, and she was ready to do whatever I wanted. She grabbed the back of my legs and her hands, then opened me up, and pushed it in so that a small gob of white spunk flew into the air.</p> <p>The sight of her doing this made me groan, but I wasn't going to say anything, since I couldn't speak either. Marianne's fingers were busy with my cock. She moved it around in her hands, which made it feel warm and good. The sight of her doing this, of her little hand wrapped around me, was almost as big an orgasm as her vagina. Her fingers were working on her pussy better than I did. Her hand moved faster, and her breathing started to get faster, too.</p> <p>"What's the matter?"</p> <p>She looked me in the eyes, and smiled. "I'm ready."</p> <p>To tell the truth, I would've loved to come by just now, even if it was because I hadn't been able to hold out the whole day, but I was too far gone now, and I needed to fuck her again. I looked into her eyes, and saw the same passion and passion I saw in her eyes when she had my cock in her mouth before.</p> <p>I moved in her until I was close to the point of coming, then I stopped and let her relax. She held my cock, and I felt her fingers working on my hole. I felt my balls tighten, and it was almost a physical reaction to the thought that I'd come so late.</p> <p>I lay still for a moment, until a few seconds later, her fingers were rubbing my little hole. Then she looked at me and smiled. "Can you stay a while?" She asked.</p> <p>"Sure." I said.</p> <p>She didn't wait for a reply, so I asked, "Can I stay a little longer?" She looked surprised for a moment, then put her finger to my little hole and moved to kiss me. She sucked my lower lip for a moment and then kissed me. She broke and got up, turning around, then reached back to grab the bed post. She reached between her legs, and took my cock in one hand. I watched as she rubbed the head of it with the outer tip of her fingers. That look of sexual wonderment on her face, when she looked at me when she brought me closer to coming, drove me crazy. She took me in her mouth as well, and she let me go the first time. That's what it was called. "You're so good for me." Marianne said as I started to come down.</p> <p>I'm not sure how much longer I felt the pleasure of her tongue, but her pussy, dancing all around my cock. I was not sure that I'd come much before, because all we didn't think of course that, but, but the thought of that, but of us together we both feeling—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
