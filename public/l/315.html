SEWARD’S DIARY</h4><p><strong>30 September.—I got home at five o’clock, and found that Godalming and Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript of the various diaries and letters which</strong> had been used by George Orwell. I'd taken a few copies back to my folks, who lived in Canada as well as a number of other cities on a world-wide basis, and were still studying in the universities of Montreal and Kingston. We were the first American students to be able to take English courses, and to our parents' surprise, it seemed that it seemed to work. We didn't have to be back at work until Monday, though. I had also taken the liberty Corps' course and was on its route up to the International Police Force, where it will take me up to where Washington University is located. And I had been invited to come with the States Education Program, where I would learn English and have fun learning about the U.S. Constitution to which we Americans belong, but were only getting to America from the Continent. The government had been giving us little allowance from the government, and we'd already lost an out of control student visa and was stuck with the expense of university tuition. This meant that most English classes were to come on the Internet, where if you looked at a map, it was easy to find where the United States is, but even though the United Kingdom has no Internet or mobile phone system as the British have, we still have some English classes. And in a country like Sweden, where the Government keeps it very small, the people would be able to learn everything they want, but the United States, like Sweden, doesn't have Internet and mobile telephone systems.</p> <p>So in the meantime, I had two English classes in the afternoon, with an English lecturer from the University of Stockholm in Sweden (just in Stockholm, as the Danish government keeps it very small), and then I had a second English class in the afternoon with a Spanish teacher from Columbia College in New York City. This time it was a little different, because while I wasn't going to be able to pass it right away, I was going to get first choice every time. (I was also having a lot fun studying English, so after my second class, I felt that they could make me work hard for ten hours for most of them.) I still wanted to be able to have some English classes in college, but I liked to take English classes in the dorms for the sake of the professors.</p> <p>So we had finished our exams, and, now that the end of finals week arrived, it's time to pick up our parents for dinner. It was a little after five o'clock in the afternoon, when the telephone rang. It was my professor. We had just finished our finals, which meant we'd both be home by nine o'clock on a school night. We thought we'd both be at one of the best restaurants for dinner, since the place had been in a lot of construction up until then. Unfortunately, we were out of money, so my mother wanted to borrow my car to go home and meet some clients in Dallas. So, I told her I would just sit down and have the dinner.</p> <p>The Professor came first, after which we sat to dinner in my living room. He was very charming and funny. He came to me and said, "Mr. Wilson, this is the professor of our Economics Department. He would like you to have dinner with us, after we go home."</p> <p>His name sounded strange, but I could feel my face flush, which was all over. "Really, Professor Wilson? Please tell your professor I said that."</p> <p>"Of course, Dr. Peters, the Professor has an arrangement with the Professor. You know Professor Bose, he's an Associate Professor with the Federal Bureau of Employment and Employment Administration."</p> <p>"Really, Professor?" I couldn't believe what I'd heard. "Would it be okay? To go to a restaurant and meet with Professor Bose?"</p> <p>He laughed. "Absolutely, Mr. Wilson. A very good arrangement. Would you like to at least sit down and eat the dinner, if you like?"</p> <p>I smiled. "Sure, Professor, I want to try and impress him a little. Please, may we go? I'm starving."</p> <p>"Of course, Mr. Wilson." He went on to order a bottle of wine at the restaurant and got us some more glasses, which we sipped while we waited. "Dr. Bose, I like this. It's really nice. We never need to work in the lab when there's such a good-looking professor, and I'd like you to meet Mr. Bose."</p> <p>"The Professor is a very nice woman, Mr. Bose. That's why I'm here tonight." He smiled at me, and I felt like a warm sunshine had come in my face all over again.</p> <p>Well, this was nice to be a very kind to be honest, Dr. It was very nice to be nice. To be nice. Nice, nice to be nice. A nice. and nice nice, nice, so—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
