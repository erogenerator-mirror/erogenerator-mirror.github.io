The theory</strong>, though, could only be that these men exist to fuck women and to do that is illegal. But, these men and boys were already doing it, in one way and another. They were in the presence of two women who could easily be fucked by a dozen men. Then, just like the first time, they were all fucking them, too. This time that they were all fucking themselves.</p> <p>"I'm gonna fuck you," whispered one of the boys as he leaned down to kiss the girl's open neck.</p> <p>The boy moved his hands over the boy's chest and his fingers started to rub their way down his naked body. When they reached his stiff cock, he pulled it against his own stomach. The boy's stiff cock had an upward curve to it that was much to different from any he'd ever touched before. The boy's cock was about the same length as the boy's, if not a little bigger. But, when it came to his cock, the boy was definitely bigger. The boy's cock was longer than the other boy's cock, but thicker. The smaller cock on the smaller side looked about six inches shorter than the larger one.</p> <p>"What is your name?" The boy asked the girl. He was on the ground beside the girl, and his hands were moving to cover his erection. The girl watched the boy move his hands off his cock. She sat up and turned around to let him see her naked body, but no one else was there.</p> <p>"Donna," she said and looked at that same naked body.</p> <p>"What are you?" The boy replied. He stood up and the girl felt his hands move to cover her body. He touched her breasts and felt her erect nipples through her t-shirt.</p> <p>"I'm Donna," Donna said. She looked at the girl who was in front of the boy, and looked at him. She looked at the boy who was looking at her before her. "My husband," she said. "Your name's Jason."</p> <p>Jason's eyes widened as Donna looked back at his naked body. Her eyes moved to his erect cock and he felt his own cock growing hard. He wanted that hard cock in her so badly, but couldn't bring himself to do it. In front of all the other naked men there, he was about to fuck Donna. The only reason he could go was because of a moral question. Jason had to wait a little longer though. He wanted Donna so badly. He wanted the girl who had been in the hot tub. He looked over at the girl's hands which were on his body, and saw his hands touching her breasts. He didn't even know the girl. His thoughts turned to the hard cocks in front of him. The girl's hands felt so good on him and he leaned his chest against her and let his hand stroke up to her breast.</p> <p>Donna's mouth opened as her fingers moved under her bra. She felt his hand brush against her nipple. Jason hadn't touched or touched her nipples. She'd already told him they were sensitive and that she thought so. Jason had touched the nipples on her body and she liked it. She smiled.</p> <p>Jason smiled at her. "It's ok," he said. "It's just that I've always wanted to do it with a woman," Jason said and looked down at her body. But, Jason had never touched a girl's body. He only did it in the showers and he was always too shy and scared.</p> <p>Jason thought of Donna and knew he'd never do it with a woman because of some fear and because he wasn't sure she really wanted him. He wondered if she really wasn't sure he'd want to do it. He didn't know how much that it meant that he wouldn't want to. How much was fear, embarrassment, and pleasure on him for having sex with Donna.</p> <p>They were both naked now. It was a naked beach, a nude beach, for that reason. Yet, the girl was completely naked, which seemed odd at the time, but it didn't matter. He couldn't understand the way they looked. Jason's cock was still rock hard. The girl pulled his naked body against her naked body. She was leaning against him.</p> <p>"My husband, Jason," Donna said. She looked over at Jason. "He's naked too," she said. She could feel his hard cock against her naked assock and tried to ignore the feeling of Jason's erection, so close to her. She was tempted to lift her foot up onto the foot rail, but she didn't, afraid if she did, she'd be tempted to do anything else.</p> <p>Jason didn't know what to do. Even though he'd been in the company of a naked girl before, even though, to touch her body was still sexy. He felt so different and he'd liked to see the girl and touch her. Jason's body like Donna's it was soâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
