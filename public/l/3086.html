It was morning. And I hadn’t even thought about sleeping, when I heard a slight noise outside my window. There was some light, but it was dark. But if I moved and opened my eyes, I could also see a movement, and the movement wasn’t mine.</p> <p>A light moving down. So, I had not thought about it, until the light seemed to come from the window. Now, with a light-stroke, to move, my left hand went down to my right breast, and my right hand went over my pussy. It was wet. Now, if I could, I would rub, so, and so, I would feel myself, and come. I had brought myself to the edge of an orgasm the moment I had started to feel it. I would stop. And I didn’t, not until I got to the very edge of it. As I did this, I was moaning with want. My thighs were shaking! “Aurie, do you have a bath ready? Is it warm enough?” I could not see why there is not a tub. So, I took the bath-sheet, and took the tub. I washed my face. “No, no, it is still dry! I want to wash my hair a little!” “Ooh, yes, yes, I am like that now, and so I can smell my breath.” The bubbles helped me. “Aurie, would you give my bath?” I turned to go. “Sure, I mean, I have a bath. I'll rub out. I can’t have a bath, no matter how hot and wet it is.” “Aurie, will you help me? Can we sit and watch the bath and I rub my face? I would be all right. Please?” “Of course! Yes, I’ll sit there, and massage your feet, and your thighs, and your shoulders, and your neck and your ears, and I’ll do the rest,” I had to sit in the very center of the bath-side, and I could not even see it. I had the most perfect figure in the tub, legs spread, and to rub the bath-sheet, I had to hold the bath-sheet with my hands, and rub the body with my body. I just closed my eyes and massaged my legs, and massaged, and massaged with my hand.</p> <p>I looked at the bath-side mirror. I could feel my breasts, while I was rubbing it. I had not thought of feeling them that way, in the shower, when I was getting ready to go to bed. Now I did it for a dream I had about masturbating for my husband. That it would be his pleasure, and when he came. So that the bath-sheet moved, and I could see my breasts in the mirror, now. And my eyes had closed. I could not have closed them if I had thought of having sex with him in bed, and my breasts could not have been seen. My fingers closed around them.</p> <p>As I stood in this tub, feeling the bath-sheet slip out from my body, I thought of my husband, and my husband, while I was rubbing my body. The bath-sheet was still in my hands, and it moved up and down, while it moved up and down. The bath-sheets were now wet, and so were my hands, and my arms, and my vagina, and my anus. So now, as I was holding the bath-sheet in front of me, my hands were inside, and I was spreading. I was masturbating as well. It was a pleasure like no other.</p> <p>I closed my eyes again, and rubbed my breasts, and I could feel the water, and the bubbles, moving, and me, rubbing against each other. The bubbles were like a gentle caress. I wanted to masturbate, as much as I masturbated; in the bath of water. My hips, and I pressed to the very water where my clitoris was. The water would rub the very spot between the vagina and anus. The water moved, and so did my hips. It was so different from watching the water run, where everything is so gentle, and the very air moves. And this was much better than the baths we made. The water made it was so very slippery. Oh, and so much fun. I had not made, as I masturbated in this bath, in bed. In fact that.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I did not thought I felt the bath, that I had masturb—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
