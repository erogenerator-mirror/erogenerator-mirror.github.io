Yet, we all need to get over them.</p> <p>Maybe we all need to talk about what happens when you get involved in your love-making.</p> <p>Maybe we all need to talk about what happens when you make love to your lover's pussy.</p> <p>Maybe we all need to talk about what happened on my wedding night.</p> <p>Maybe we need to chat about what happens when I kiss the bride's breasts and you start to lick the groom's pussy.</p> <p>Maybe we need to talk about what you can do with your mouth and tongue, even better with those two vibrators and the three Dildo vibrators.</p> <p>Maybe we can talk about all that we want to know about each other, we shouldn't talk.</p> <p>What I really like to talk about is our love-making.</p> <p>There are so many things that are really very complicated with you.</p> <p>We haven't talked about us and you.</p> <p>We haven't even seen the other side of you.</p> <p>Our love-making can't be that messy or boring. There's really plenty of food, plenty of clothes, we can't keep our hands off each other.</p> <p>Maybe we're not the most romantic couple but we can talk about it.</p> <p>Perhaps we like to go to the bedroom and I take the other one off, we can talk about that too.</p> <p>Maybe we like it slow.</p> <p>Maybe we like the missionary position and I take the other one off. What was the first option?</p> <p>Maybe we like having your legs up high and my cock inside of you.</p> <p>Maybe we can talk about what each other likes and what it feels like to be with someone other than me.</p> <p>So let's talk about everything that happens when you kiss someone's breast and your lips kiss the other breast.</p> <p>Maybe we can even be friends with another couple if we're alone.</p> <p>Maybe we like eating each other's pussy too, which is not a good idea.</p> <p>Sometimes we can talk about fucking and what we should do if we're alone in bed after everyone turns off the lights and comes down, but most of the time we're not really talking about fucking and kissing at the same time.</p> <p>Maybe we just like to talk about all the different experiences with other people; the time we have at your party over at the college and what we do if we're together on our Honeymoon.</p> <p>I know, all I know is sex, talking, kissing, sucking, feeling, stroking, licking, feeling, sucking, feeling, touching, feeling</p> <p>And you never know if another person and another situation will bring about sexual situations.</p> <p>There is one thing though; that doesn't sound right but if I ever get the courage to talk to you about sex, ask out you are very sexy woman and you would make the woman of my dreams a happy woman.</p> <p>If you like, I can even let my male friends fuck me.</p> <p>If you like, I'd like to fuck my male friends with just about everything you find interesting.</p> <p>And then the sex can get sexual again.</p> <p>If you feel safe, we don't talk about our past sexual relationships, we don't talk about future sex with a partner but we talk about sex. Talk about sex with the person who brought you to orgasm in your bed. Talk about sex with anyone or anything but talk about sex with anyone. Sex with people with the same sex.</p> <p>I'm having the same feelings as you are and if there is anything the people I know have in common with me that won't help the situation, but I just don't feel safe anymore.</p> <p>Then I'll get home and I'll look you in the eyes and kiss you, even if you haven't done it the first time, that is, if you weren't my man</p> <p>just because you're here in your bedroom so you can see that I'm getting home</p> <p>you can see there you can watch you get home</p> <p>because of home so can get home gone you can get home you can be home is home be you're happy to get home</p> <p>gget home to come home—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
