His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time.</strong> But today they were together again, for Mr. Bingley could scarcely wait for his friend to leave. Tonight he would have sex with his friend's wife. He just hoped they would fuck each other once more.</p> <p>As he stood over the bath, he felt his dick harden at the sight, and he began stroking it. Mr. Bingley sighed and pulled back. He saw himself in the mirror, and he was amazed to see what he had, a nice eight inches of hard cock. He turned his back to the mirror and began to rub himself. He sighed and began to stroke himself, again amazed by the effect this was having. A shiver ran up his spine as he felt his cock becoming rock hard, and he moaned as he slowly began to get very turned on. He was sure that he could cum right then, if he wanted to.</p> <p>He was so wet now, and it was dripping down on to the bath. He rubbed his hand along his cock faster, and he heard himself moan very lightly. Mr. Bingley turned around and grabbed his ass with both hands. He slid his hand down his own body, and rubbed the skin there. He was completely smooth now. He rubbed his cock faster now, and it was still standing straight up. He turned around again, and stuck his right leg out, as he began massaging his balls. His eyes met the image in the mirror, and Mr. Bingley could see how turned on he was. He pumped his cock faster now, still imagining it. He was so hot. He needed more of this.</p> <p>He slipped his hands under his shirt, and began to rub his nipples, which were now hard as rocks. He had never been an exhibitionist before, but he knew that he had a good cock. When a guy could cum, most men did just that, and it seemed only natural to have an orgasm. A guy could cum, and ejaculate all over himself, if that was the nature of the act. Mr. Bingley had never experienced that before either. He was so into his own body. He didn't feel shy, or ashamed of having an orgasm, all he felt were a lust of his own. He had never had a sex session with a man before, except when he was jerking him off, and sometimes it felt good. He wanted to cum so bad. He wasn't sure if it was what a really good sex-session was supposed to be like, but somehow it seemed like an important part of his being. There were two basic things, and he had to admit it, this was different than with porn movies. It felt like he was watching a porn movie, and he had no way of knowing for sure what that could be. He did wonder though, if she would really show off to him. Would she be so good looking, and that he didn't even really know she had.</p> <p>Mr. Bingley began to imagine touching his own cock, feeling all around the head, and even inserting it into his own mouth. He couldn't help himself. With his other hand he reached down between his legs and began stroking his balls in and out. He had masturbated before, but he never masturbated to porn movies, and he wondered if it was even really something. He was fascinated by what his body looked like, and he began to picture some of the acts that he had read about on the internet for that reason. He didn't really know what to look at, but his penis seemed to be able to picture his own cock looking like this. He imagined stroking his fingers along his cock's head as it grew harder, and then he imagined cum shooting out of his cock. It felt so good.</p> <p>His cock began to pulse hard as he imagined cum splashing all over his stomach.</p> <p>Then he heard the shower running in to the bathroom. He jumped up and closed the door. He turned the water on and started stripping. He couldn't help himself. He had never done anything like this before, but even though he had read about it on the net, with many of the guys doing it, he never had the opportunity to really, really see it. Mr. Bingley's thoughts were now centered on a picture on the internet of what would actually happen later on in the shower. And suddenly the fantasy began.</p> <p>Mr. Bingley took two steps into the bathroom. There, standing naked under the hot jets of the shower. He smiled at the image in front of him. His cock throbbed in response to what he saw in the mirror. Mr. Bingley slowly stood up, his dick standing straight out from his body, and he saw the image in front of him again, a smile on his lips, which he looked even more aroused than he felt.</p> <p></p> <p>before him. The look of his own nakedness in the mirror made him feel like a sort of lust of need. the lookâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
