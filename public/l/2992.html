The second time was a woman! And then there were the other three times. All four times, and every time I came too close to cumming. That was the third time: the first orgasm was a woman's. Then I realized what a mistake it would be to try to have an orgasm alone. Besides, as soon as I closed my eyes and visualized my first ever lover, I was stuck here with this problem.</p> <p>I went to the bathroom first and, after taking off my underwear, took a leak, then made my way towards bed: and when I came out (with only one thing on) I immediately smelled and saw this strange smell of semen from somewhere, and it was mixed with dried sweat. It reminded me of that evening when my old, but no longer expired, husband had his cock in some woman in her ass. I immediately felt guilty at this, but didn't know why I had a problem in bed with a man like that. I turned off the light and turned on the computer again. I logged into my chatroom. I had almost logged in through my password already because I didn't want to risk a bunch of spam. It would probably be worth my trouble to just tell the hostess how I was really feeling and just tell them to forget all about my husband, because he was all mine. Then I thought that maybe I could just tell myself that he was my husband, since I have never even hinted to myself that I was a woman, like I did the day when I saw an actress naked outside having sex with a man in his car on the back row of a club. I just couldn't do that at home with anyone, in any situation. I never really had to say something to my husband; I could just tell in one word: "You're fucking me; just like you've never been fucked, and there's nothing you can do about it," and I was done. And for the last ten days, no one else would have to know! I had just discovered an inner confidence that never really got in the way of sex, even when I was with someone else.</p> <p>My mind was racing because I never imagined that I could be like that... and I had no illusions about that. To my knowledge, I had never been with a man whose semen tasted like that... or who had given that man oral sex, let alone blow him. Even knowing that it would be a "taste of" sex, that was all it would be. And then all my thoughts went haywire. I realized that the first part of my experience was indeed not a man's, but rather a woman's. The second part was about that strange smell of my husband's semen. Of course, I wanted to tell the hostess that I was his wife, but could not bring myself to do that. I felt so much relief at finding how much joy and pleasure I was about to experience, even if at home with my husband: especially when I was alone with this strange, but fascinating, man who I had just once been intimate with. Of course, my emotions were now entirely different from the way they were when I first met him. I felt so much joy at discovering that I could be a man, and be a woman and be loved by two people, one way or the other both ways. And then the second part was about to happen, because there was going to be another woman... and this woman had to be my husband. As I sat there in despair, I realized that what I was, and what I felt, was nothing but two people: my husband, and an attractive, sexy, and exotic woman.</p> <p>And then I got out of bed and turned on 'The Door.' It was really an ordinary room, at first, though the walls were not very well-lit, and there was a small, but very warm bedroom. There was little furniture inside, but one chair and one bed, so I had to guess that someplace else would be in the living room. It was strange to have all these beautiful, sexy, feminine, voluptuous women in a room. I suddenly realized to my surprise that I had always enjoyed my sex life with my husband. And had become so much more accustomed to being with men in an unconventional way that the idea of having sex with two women at the same time seemed to be an alien concept foreign concept to me. So therefore, I decided I preferred to watch this video with no apparent excitement. At least when I could see the same women in there, instead of just a woman who was the whole other women and different.
