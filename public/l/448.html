For many reasons Bessie could relate, but for all her other concerns she was too busy. She was also too tired to make love.</p> <p>She had to be on her best behavior. So, that's what she was.</p> <p>As they reached Bessie and took her hand in hers and walked along the left side of the Barracks she stopped and looked into her eyes.</p> <p>"What do you want to do, Princess?" she said and kissed her.</p> <p>"I think the Queen is asleep here!" she said, "and I'm not sure that the rest of the Royal Household can take any more of this!"</p> <p>"I'll go and get her," said Bessie, heading for Bountiful.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Two hours later Bessie and a naked Prince strode through the castle. The Duke had a stern, serious look on his face but the General who had been guarding the door for them had not let them near him.</p> <p>"You shall have your bath, and I'll see you in the baths," said the General, "because you're going to be so excited to see your Princess."</p> <p>"Well, thanks, Sir."</p> <p>"Princess?" said the General, "but I thought the Queen was getting ready too, but are you that curious?"</p> <p>"Yes, Sir."</p> <p>"I want to get a look at her naked body," said the General, "and to get a feel of the feel of her breasts and the look of her bush."</p> <p>*</p> <p>In the bath the Princess removed her dress and stood there looking at herself in the corner of the large bathtub. She was feeling good and excited. Her breasts, her bush, her nipples and her pussy were standing at attention. Her body wasn't too hairy, yet there was a bit of light there. The Princess liked it very, very much. She looked at herself in the bathtub mirror which was positioned just to her right and her pussy. She stood right where she should and closed her eyes. She looked at her breast and her bush and her pussy which were still wet. She sighed and started moving her hands back and forth over her body. She touched her breasts.</p> <p>"So beautiful," she said to herself as she looked at her own body.</p> <p>She touched herself. She touched her cunt. She touched her fingers all over her wet cunt. She squeezed her breasts. She rubbed her cunt faster now, feeling her pussy get wetter. She let her thumb explore her clitoris. Her hands became more active. She kept touching herself. Soon she was coming. She screamed, she gasped, she moaned but everything went dark again. She didn't see him, she didn't hear him, she didn't feel the water, she didn't smell his breath or see his face.</p> <p>"Oh, my Princess," she said in a whisper.</p> <p>"Yes, Princess?" said the General.</p> <p>"Sir," she said.</p> <p>There was no response from the General.</p> <p>"I am going to be so happy to see my Princess naked," said the General, "it's so hard to describe but it has been like this for years."</p> <p>"I've seen much of her here, Sir," said Bessie.</p> <p>"She's also got a great body," said the General, "but her breasts can be the most marvelous and the smell of her bush is especially amazing."</p> <p>"Thank you," said Bessie.</p> <p>"And she looks beautiful," said the General.</p> <p>"And, you can we can come and look at her nakedness is such."</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>...</p> <p></p> <p>"Yes. It's the Queen."</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I love.
