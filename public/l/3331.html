English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter LXXIII. The Higher Man. Par. 1.</h4><p><strong>Nietzsche admits, here, that at one time he had thought of appealing to the people, to the crowd in the market-place, but that he had ultimately to abandon the task.</strong> That he had only ever been in the market, in the city, when it wasn't him where he wanted to be, what he needed to be. He's glad now, he loves fucking me, and I love fucking him. We kiss and he's thrilled, I'm glad. I love fucking his cock. You're going to like it.</p> <p>He was going to be good, he knows, he knows. He's good.</p> <p>It was good? Nice. Good? There's plenty of time for that later, right? Better to make him cum first. Right?</p> <p>I can't believe you've got a cock.</p> <p>This is like the first time I've ever heard of a person putting two and two together.</p> <p>You've got a cock.</p> <p>Nice.</p> <p>A cock. There's more to you than words. More than being a sexy, hot, young woman in the market where she ought find a man, a man. That's the best you can feel for that kind of a man.</p> <p>We kiss.</p> <p>Love.</p> <p>Yeah.</p> <p>Because he loves kissing while also fucking you while fucking me.</p> <p>Love.</p> <p>I love kissing while fucking you.</p> <p>I love fucking while fucking you while fucking you.</p> <p>And then I'll love fucking you.</p> <p>And then he'll love fucking me.</p> <p>It's getting good, isn't it? That he's fucking you, even though I've never said anything, but his cock is inside me in just a few moments, and he's fucking me in the way of a really good fuck.</p> <p>This is like the first time, too. That's so perfect.</p> <p>Love.</p> <p>And then he's going to fuck me, too, right?</p> <p>I can't believe I'm feeling this good right now.</p> <p>So you can fuck me, too? You can?</p> <p>Of course I'll fuck you while fucking you.</p> <p>I can't believe I'm not feeling this good too. Because the other part of my body is feeling this good. This good feeling is fucking your cock again, too.</p> <p>I can't believe I'm so wet.</p> <p>A wet pussy, too?</p> <p>This feeling, this warm feeling, of my arousal from what he's doing and how he's fucking me.</p> <p>Do you know how my arousal was from this?" he asked, as he continued to fuck me.</p> <p>"I can't do this," I admitted, "it's too good. Too good."</p> <p>"I can't."</p> <p>"No," I said. The way he said the word, "no," I knew it meant something else than sex and a woman would fuck him. That was the word, the word of a male that's not even female. This man is a man. I don't think he means anything more than that word that he's a man. I'm certain he's a woman, that he's a man, not some woman's daughter, or another girl's mother.</p> <p>I want to ask a question. "But why?" I asked.</p> <p>He was silent.</p> <p>"Because? Because you've been looking at me all afternoon. You want me? Want me to be with another woman?"</p> <p>He did not answer me. He just pulled my body against his, and we kissed, like lovers kiss with each other.</p> <p>I'm so turned on by that.</p> <p>He said, "I want to show you to my house again. I can't be so forward. I'm just too big. I'm too big not to make love to you, but I just can't."</p> <p>"It's okay. It's perfect, isn't it?"</p> <p>"Of course it is," he said. He stopped for a moment to lift his cock, which had lost none of its hardness, from my pussy. I was so wet. It was also swollen as if I was afraid of him taking it away. I'm sorry.</p> <p>He looked into my eyes and said, "I love you so much."</p> <p>"And I love you. I think that I'm in love with you."</p> <p>We sat there kissing for a full minute and, when he finally pulled away from me, I couldn't contain my desire for him any longer, so I asked him.</p> <p>"Then what?"</p> <p>"Then you make love to me next."</p> <p>"Is that what you want? Is that what you want?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"That would be very special, wouldn't it?" which is why he asked. you?" a man is so perfect. That would be special. not so great, because I thought. which is why he's why I am so wonderful. "w." in love?
