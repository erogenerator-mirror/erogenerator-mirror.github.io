G. Wells </h3><h4>Epilogue</h4><p><strong>One cannot choose but wonder. Will he ever return? It may be that he swept back into the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy savages of the Age of</strong> the Undead. But I must make him feel like the one. He has been waiting for a while now and I am the one he has been thinking about all day. He will be a long lost son of a bitch, and at least he won't regret it.</p> <p>I can see it now. His cock was throbbing; he wanted to see it. He wanted to make it explode again. He had thought about this, when he masturbated, he'd dreamed of it. The day he would be lost to me in my arms was now; it was going to be a day of love and passion that would be a day of first and last. And there was only one possibility right there.</p> <p>"Get those pants down!" I ordered sternly, and pulled them down. I looked at his dick and there was no question about how much it wanted to go. His dick was large, the head was small even larger than it had become, and as I looked at it it was just as hard and long as it had been at all. It had a little pre-cum oozing from it and a big, bulbous head. It was just as thick as I remembered it being, and it looked to be quite huge. I could see the precum dripping from it and I could also see a bead on the end of it.</p> <p>"What's yours better than this?"</p> <p>I didn't take his mind off his cock any further and simply pulled him to my arms. He had to lean back against the desk to do so, and all he could do was wrap his hands over my face and shoulders. "Now you, go down on him."</p> <p>The word sent him over the edge. His dick was so hard it was beginning to hurt and it had a mind of its own, and at the same time he started kissing me and tonguing me, and I felt myself getting hot as well. After about five minutes he moved down and put his dick at the entrance to my cunt and he began to push into me gently, and just before he was going to pull out he put his hand to the base of my skull and pushed the rest of my head between his fingers.</p> <p>I couldn't believe the pleasure I was feeling just from that moment on. I couldn't help but feel that we could have done something like that, but it was so good. I looked down at the dong in my hand, it was enormous. It was not even flaccid by any standard, but even bigger than the dildo I had been using. It was about eight-inches long and it curved around the balls. My own penis had finally recovered from the event itself and, as the head entered my cunt, there was no hesitation in having him.</p> <p>I thought I had been holding back, but he was having none of that. He pushed all the way in and started fucking me back, with a slow, steady motion, making me moan quietly.</p> <p>At the same time as he moved he put his hands under my shirt and started massaging my breasts. The sensation wasn't too different from the dildo in my hand; it was different than anything I had ever felt, and the feeling of power was more so.</p> <p>We kissed for a minute.</p> <p>"I could really get used to this," I said.</p> <p>"Not as much as I could. Besides you are not a man, I wouldn't believe this shit."</p> <p>"Nope, I'm already ready."</p> <p>"Do it."</p> <p>He continued making love to me, even the slow strokes of each thrust caused my penis to begin to tingle. I couldn't believe how good it was feeling. I didn't know about many other guys, but I did feel it when another guy would, I am sure, try to make love to me. The first thing he did was give me a good kiss, it was as if the experience was the essence of love, and it brought back every little pleasure I felt. I had never been with a man like this before and this was the kind of pleasure I was looking forward to doing anything with.</p> <p>He put one arm around my back, pulling me closer with every thrust, and I looked down to see if I could see his dick entering my cunt. It was huge; it was thick and veiny. There was no way I could have taken all of that cock in me. It had to be ten inches long inside me. It was as if I was a girl having a huge cock inside her, and I couldn't ever remember feeling fuller. "Oh, yeah," I said.</p> <p>When he moved his right hand under mine I could feel it on my belly, and felt my nipple as I played with it and it was now in my fist. While we continued this we were still having sex, I was pulling each other hand on one of his arms, pulling and moving it.
