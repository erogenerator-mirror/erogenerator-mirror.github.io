On the tenth of August the regiment Prince Andrew commanded was marching along the highroad past the avenue leading</strong> to the Great Hall of Erechis.</p> <p>They marched to the grandstands, the Royal Palace of the Kingdom of Erechis. The British Army had captured this historic Place.</p> <p>Two days later the British officers and enlisted men had the Grand Hall to their home city, London. They walked out onto a grass verge, holding each other tightly.</p> <p>The Grand Hall was a beautiful sight. There were numerous monuments and museums. The Grand Hall also housed three thousand armed soldiers and hundred twenty-something armed civilians who marched up and down the Grand Hall. The Grand Hall also housed the staff and civilian personnel. There were also numerous museums and attractions. On one side was an American History Museum, in the other was a University Hospital and Food Service.</p> <p>"I think this is the best thing to happen all year," George Orwell whispered to himself as he wrapped the medal around his neck.</p> <p>George Orwell had been his assistant a few years earlier. In fact he was the Assistant Secretary of Education. She was an aspiring economist who enjoyed teaching and supporting his cause. She was also a Secretary of Education who loved being an American History teacher and studying history.</p> <p>The relationship was very good with the American History Museum and the Library. They also were a very good physical specimen of human beings.</p> <p>They also kept an eye on the Royal Hotel, the Royal Marine and several other places within a thirty mile radius of London.</p> <p>"I know it would be nice to stay here and play golf," Orwell said.</p> <p>"I didn't say I wouldn't play golf," George replied. "I would love to stay out here with you. We are going to be such good friends," he added.</p> <p>"You are so sweet," the American History teacher replied.</p> <p>"I'll have a lot to tell you before next week. I want you to have a great time," Orwell said.</p> <p>"Of course," George replied. "I love you. I truly do."</p> <p>"Hang on so you can talk a few more minutes," George said.</p> <p>"What are you so happy about?" George asked.</p> <p>"I'd be happy to have your support," Orwell grinned as he grabbed his coat.</p> <p>"Thank you, sweetheart," George whispered as they hugged.</p> <p>"It's been a while since I've seen you smile so long," Orwell said over their shoulder.</p> <p>"Not that long," George replied.</p> <p>"Too long, as well as too long," Orwell added as he wrapped the medal around his neck again.</p> <p>"We are going to be so happy," Orwell said again. They continued their stroll.</p> <p>"We're going to be so happy," Orwell continued as they walked.</p> <p>"We are going to be much, much happier," Orwell said.</p> <p>"Well let's hope," the Englishman added. "We're here tomorrow. Goodnight," Orwell whispered. They kissed and snuggled until morning.</p> <p>"Good night. I love you," Orwell said into the darkness. "You can sleep with me tomorrow. I'd like that."</p> <p>"Promise?" the Americans woman asked.</p> <p>"You'll always be my best friend," Orwell replied. "If you need a friend to say goodbye to, ask."</p> <p>They kissed and kissed and kissed as they got to the hotel. Their hearts and minds were filled with thoughts of what could happen next.</p> <p>"I love you," Orwell whispered in the darkness. They had walked towards their room.</p> <p>"We're going to be so happy," Orwell continued as they reached their room. "I promise"</p> <p>"I love you," Orwell confirmed as their hands touched each other.</p> <p>"We both love you," the American History scholar whispered as their lips touched. They both could not keep the image of the lips touching each others virginity away.</p> <p>"Can we make love?" Orwell whispered. "I can never get enough of this. I've missed this."</p> <p>"What makes you say that?" Orwell asked.</p> <p>"It's a beautiful picture," the American History teacher replied.</p> <p>"Why don't you bring it with you," Orwell suggested as they reached their room.</p> <p>"Would you like some chocolate cake?" the American History wife asked.</p> <p>"Only if you eat it," Orwell grinned as he had already tasted chocolate cake.</p> <p>"Let's try one," the British teacher whispered.</p> <p>Inside their room, each of them stripped the other of her clothes; except for Orwell being stark naked. Their mouths met in an intimate kiss as the American history was unbuttoned their neck and her lips locked with the same chocolate cake they had previously had done to them.</p> <p></p> <p>"I love you two people who I love I hate I love I hate I hate I hate," Orwell, you," Orwell," Orwell the Nazi—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
