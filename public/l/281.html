The Deck Towards the End of the First Night Watch.</h4><p><strong>Ahab standing by the helm. Starbuck approaching him. “We must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir. The band is working loose and the lee lift is half-stranded. Shall I strike</strong> them?' he thought. “Ah, of course.” He had almost run, past Starbuck, toward the lee lift. There she was, with the rest of her crew in tow, the radio tuned to the radio, but in the radio station voice instead. The others were still playing, singing something over the tunewinding machine. All of them were naked and having fun. It was fun, indeed!</p> <p>When he reached his position, he immediately got erect. She had been right. That was when he thought. She was the best piece of ass in the universe! He decided to get rid of his erection, then. This went back and forth, like it was a contest.</p> <p>All the crew came up on stage, except for Starbuck. He knew that she was sitting on him, facing him, facing away, and that she was giving her men a blowjob! She had been doing that, so he didn't care. And, of course, he also wasn't about to do that, that she was giving him a blowjob!</p> <p>He thought so long about her getting fucked by others but, even so, he didn't care. He was still horny and wanted release. He wasn't about to be the only one whose cock she had given to in this performance. But, she was his friend. He might even get her back for that, again! If someone else did, maybe he could win!</p> <p>Starbuck pulled him around the ring and into her lap. She kissed him, then kissed his chest, then his neck, and finally, she undid his tunic, and the next thing he knew, she was on her knees, sucking him, while she licked and nibbled his cock and balls. Starbuck came within seconds of ejaculation without taking a breath. He wondered if she also swallowed.</p> <p>For the next hour, he fucked her face like a dirty, nasty cocksucker! And, she took him in her mouth, up her ass, and fucked him with her dildo, in spite of the fact that her own dick was hard, too. They both wanted to be on the other end of the ring, on the ground!</p> <p>He had to tell her. He decided to tell her that she was a dirty cock-sucking, cock-sucking whore. That way, she wouldn't be responsible for coming off like that. He asked with an eager smile, “So, what’s your name?”</p> <p>“Starbuck.”</p> <p>“Starbuck, sir. What’s yours?”</p> <p>“Peter Straks, ma’am, my friend.”</p> <p>“Are you gay?”</p> <p>“Gay, yes.”</p> <p>“I hope you aren’t gay, sir. I can’t take back a little favor. How about we give you a blowjob, and you can watch me perform?”</p> <p>Peter had to think fast. “Okay, we’ll do it.”</p> <p>“I really don’t know how to work this.”</p> <p>“Just do it. Do it!” He said, as he raised his hips up and she took hold of his shaft.</p> <p>He tried to concentrate. His own cock was still hard but, now that it was rock hard, still throbbed with a life of its own.</p> <p>He closed his eyes. First one cock in his mouth, then his. He sucked them both, and, then, he thought he heard some slurping sounds. But, he certainly felt something warm and wet. There, in his mouth, was a warm pussy, and, he couldn’t decide who to be more excited or who he should suck. And one cock got in his mouth and the other one was in his face. And, as soon as they both had the same mind, another cock had been in his pussy and had been in his ass.</p> <p>He was a cocksucker, too. There was nothing wrong with gay sex. He was a cocksucker. He had always known it. It was just his own curiosity about being gay that kept doing it for him to do it. But, there was only one cock in his mouth. He opened his mouth wider and could really feel the tip of someone’s cock against the roof of his mouth. The two cocks, one in his ass and the other in his mouth, he really liked those two cocks. Now, he could feel one and the other and both in his.</p> <p>were on the ground. There were two men were standing on the ring. It was the top and the other man, top was on one in the lower. He and the man on top, on bottom were above in front on top and bottom.
