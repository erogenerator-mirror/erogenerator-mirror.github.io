At the conceit and apprehension that such and such a one hath</h4><p><strong>sinned, thus reason with thyself; What do I know whether this be a sin indeed, as it seems to be? But if it be, what do I know but that</strong> these are a most precious and precious thing, which is in fact, all that has been and will be, the gift of God to the one who will now possess a son, a son with a son to fuck. With that, I move my hands down to my hips and lift them up towards the heavens; and they seem so to so, so sweet, so lovely. How many fingers are there to be made, how many fingers are created? My face turns to a smile as my eyes look down upon her beautiful body. I move down until all the flesh is before me; when I reach my face, I can see her entire body is so smooth, so flawless, so gorgeous and so lovely! I can even see her nipples are erect. I can see that she is excited by my hands on her breasts, which are so smooth and so perfect, so beautifully shaped. All this is, of course, all for an instant before I realize that she has not cum, that a finger, a tongue, a penis, a lover, she has never given one to me. But then I remember what she told me, that she was told to be a virgin, just "in the back" when sex was allowed and it is, of course, forbidden, as it is forbidden today. My heart skips a beat, which shows my own sorrow because I want her so very much, so very much; but I cannot go on, I cannot think of her, can't think of anything except those wonderful breasts and soft, tender lips upon mine. I close my eyes and think of her hands as I feel her breasts pressed firmly against my hand, her hands, her lips, her lips as the first to my mouth. I can see the lust in her eyes as if it were in my heart then as it was in her eyes. I am not afraid to embrace her, can be drawn nearer to find her, to be a lover if she is a lover. I am not really ready to be one; more than ready, not really, but I am in love with her now, I know that. And this knowledge makes me want to kiss her, I want to kiss her lips, her eyes, hers.</p> <p>I stand now in my living room, naked, as she was before and as I look at the mirror, I feel, more than feel, that this love that was made is not really mine to love any more. In time I will have to get out of her, but now I need not fear the fact that this love has never come. I feel that I can love her, that I can share a feeling of a child which I share at times with my father at those times, but that is now gone to the arms of the loving arms who have given me the love of my life. I love her with all the love of my life and for that I want to have her.</p> <p>And with that I know that we will be together forever, forever, foreverâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
