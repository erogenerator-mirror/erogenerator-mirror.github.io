END OF THE STORY OF THE CAKE.</h4><p><strong>La Esmeralda turned pale and descended from the pillory, staggering as she went. The voice of the recluse still pursued her,— “Descend! descend! Thief of Egypt! thou shalt ascend it</strong>!”</p> <p>“I thought it was a myth.” Chapter 6</p> <p>Deserach,</p> <p>The man had risen early. He had done so at first, to a night party that would have given her time to be alone with the woman beneath, to a moment of pleasure when she would be in love with only her lover. And then she had left.</p> <p>Now, he sat, waiting in his bedroll, eyes closed, as a small smile curved his lips. He had come awake for just a moment. With no memory of her passing.</p> <p>But he wanted her gone. Wanted to wake up from her sleeping body so quickly he wondered if he could stay awake long enough for her to come back.</p> <p>No. He would sleep just a little longer.</p> <p>Deserach had risen. She had returned. He had come up in search of her—or to watch her wake.</p> <p>He sat, waiting. He was tired. He didn't want to wait. He wanted to wake her before she awakened.</p> <p>He leaned on the bedroll over his head, legs splayed apart. He lifted his head, eyes closed, waiting to see what she would do while she slept.</p> <p>She did wake and opened her eyes. She sat upright on the bedroll and looked around the room. She was naked—and beautiful. She was beautiful. Her features were flawless. Her eyes were blue. It was the sun. Her hair had changed to dark blonde. Her nose was pink. She wore glasses on her nose. She had changed her hair color. Her hair had changed to white. Her hair was long and straight. And her blue eyes looked good.</p> <p>She had never been a beauty queen before, perhaps not even a celebrity. He could never understand it.</p> <p>He stared, mesmerized. His body was stiff in anticipation, like the muscles of his body tightened on each motion of his fingers. His heart was beating. He could feel himself growing harder, harder and harder.</p> <p>His cock hardened and stood at near-eighty-five-percent stiffness, his chest rising and falling almost imperceptibly and the veins standing out on his neck stiffened until they stood out nearly an octopus-size black line. His mouth was dry. It was the only thing he could do to keep his body from trembling and jittering. It was the only thing for her—</p> <p>No. No.</p> <p>No. That would be too much. Too much of a failure. Deserach shook her head in frustration at the thought. She smiled shyly at the idea, thinking he could have found her the same way. She had been naked.</p> <p>She hadn't.</p> <p>Had he found her? Had he been a dream? Could he have actually come to her and rescued her from her own bed? Could a dream like this have been real? Had a woman like that been kidnapped and sold into slavery not long ago and not had it been planned beforehand?</p> <p>But, the dreams weren't dream. No, it was in a nightmare. Only a dream.</p> <p>She smiled. She remembered how he had tried to find her—and how he had been trying. His hand had seemed small and clumsy to her as he took his shirt off, but with nothing more than the slightest resistance he had exhibited, she had responded.</p> <p>His hands had been so tight around her, she thought, his fingers tight enough to be able to wrap themselves around her neck.</p> <p>“Don’t move me, darling.”</p> <p>His voice was hoarse and low.</p> <p>She knew she should have moved. She should have taken the sleeping pill, but a wave of dizziness overcame her. She held a breath, and then she exhaled slowly, her face moving a little wider as her body relaxed, but only for a moment.</p> <p>“Don’t speak,” she breathed.</p> <p>She was close to orgasm. He was close to giving her the orgasm—and it would probably take much longer if he continued to pretend it had never happened.</p> <p>Deserach couldn't help herself. She leaned down, her body moving with his, and her eyelids fluttered a fraction. She leaned her head back, and rested it on his shoulder, and the tips of her fingers brushed his hair. grazed him. as they kissed his shoulder. as they stroked. and hers. as they stroked as they kissed.</p> <p></p> <p>She was near to the edge that was his shoulder. to the edge of her breast.</p> <p></p> <p>that—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
