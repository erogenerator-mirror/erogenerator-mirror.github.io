Mrs Smith hurried to get the morning paper in her purse from her room before heading into the bedroom.</p> <p>Mrs Hart was a little over dressed for her college classes to prepare and she quickly pulled down her sweatpants, leaving the blue cotton of her panties over her panties. She stepped into the shower and turned it on, making sure that it was clean and it was not cold.</p> <p>She had decided to use the soap in the kitchen that had the kitchen table open in the kitchen. She walked into the bathroom and turned on the water, taking it off and dropping it out the corner of the shower to the floor. She opened the glass door of the shower and grabbed her shower gel, rubbing it all over her body, starting with her shoulders. Her breasts and stomach were very sensitive and her backside became rock hard when her flesh was squeezed against her. It was the first time that she had been turned on that way.</p> <p>Her nipples were already hard and her breasts were so round and firm in her hands that she could have grabbed a handful of them in every room in town but she chose not to. Even though it was cold and raining outside, she couldn't believe the way it had turned her on. She turned the shower on and began washing herself in the shower, looking at her body in the mirror. Just as she finished she opened the shower door and stepped out, toweling her body down as best she could.</p> <p>Her hand drifted across her firm tits, making her nipples erect. The water felt so nice as it washed the soap off of her body. She stood there and let the water soak into the softness of her breast. It was the first time that she had felt her breasts being stimulated after so long.</p> <p>She felt her clit swell and start to ache even though she still could not believe that a guy would want her like this. It did not bother her if they would be naked and that would bother her if she had sex every day. The excitement alone would make her feel so good.</p> <p>She walked over to the bar in the kitchen area. Then she sat down on the bar stool, sipping on some water and letting steamy air and steam fall into her lungs. The hot water felt so good on her body and made her feel so naked.</p> <p>Her hands went to her crotch, squeezing her inner thighs, making her pussy juices flow freely. There was a soft but insistent sound like a slap against thigh and it made her feel so naughty.</p> <p>She looked into the mirror at her hard breasts bouncing with every step. And she looked like a horny tart and that made her feel very proud of herself.</p> <p>She let her hands roam around her body, feeling the softness of her hands and exploring with every second. She felt so sexy and sexy. Even though she had never done anything like this before, she hoped that the right moment came to feel some good sex.</p> <p>She took her foot and began to squeeze it, feeling how heavy it made her legs. The firmness sent waves of pleasure into her toes. She moved her other foot, feeling how much pleasure it generated. With just an inch of space between each finger to play with the soft soft skin around her heel she felt a whole new way to experience pleasure.</p> <p>She felt like if she did not get her pussy wet enough she would be unable to walk away and she could not walk back into the kitchen any minute.</p> <p>She rubbed her hard nipple through her bra as she closed her eyes in anticipation of the pleasure.</p> <p>She opened her eyes and she saw that the lights by the pool in the dining room were already up and ready. She took her bra off and looked over to the clock to see that it was 5:30am.</p> <p>The clock next to her made it obvious that it was 3:20am and she decided to get a glass of water. She returned to the bathroom and put her panties in the hamper and her bra on the dryer, making sure they did not give the same impact to the panties as to the clothing.</p> <p>She looked into the mirror to see the face of a girl in love, standing before her with her eyes closed and feeling that naughty anticipation. She closed her eyes and rubbed her pussy. In the mirror she could see her backside of her clit. Her legs and there were bare, the small pink underwear; the white cotton of her panties against her panties were so transparent pink cotton panties. Her pink cotton panties; her hair topless bra.</p> <p></p> <p>When she looked at the window again, she could see the face was closed it was exposed now.</p> <p>she had to the window.
