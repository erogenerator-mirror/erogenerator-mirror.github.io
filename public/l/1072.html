It was three years since he had left his grandfather. Both parties had remained on the same terms, without attempting to</strong> change the relationship. Both parties were in agreement regarding this, because each party understood the relationship the other found necessary. Thus, that's why he would never change the agreement with her. It was time for him to move on.</p> <p>And in that moment they felt more together than ever before, with his parents leaving the country, Marius leaving the country for his wife and home with his mother. Life had to be perfect. He would do anything for her, whatever was needed between them. Yet, the fact was, they did little more than kiss. To him, she made no sound that night. He just left the lights out on her bed. She didn't move until he turned on all the lights, and she closed the blankets with a sigh. His hand went to light her lamp with his other hand. She closed her legs. When he turned back the lights, she opened them again. After a moment of pause in closing the lights, she turned them on again. She smiled at him and started undressing.</p> <p>Her hand went underneath the blanket, and she began rubbing herself. She got aroused enough that she could feel herself through her pajama bottom. She had never touched herself so intimately. She rubbed herself faster, making it even more exciting. As soon as she felt her finger slip inside her pussy it was over.</p> <p>The memory of him fucking her made her fingers that far back inside. It was time for them to fuck again.</p> <p>She opened the bedside table drawer, and pulled out a condom. She was wearing only one of her panties, and she handed it to him, and he took it from her. He smiled at her as he put it on, and he began doing her with his condom. He removed the condom too, and he lay on the bed, propping himself up on his arm. He looked back at her, and then started kissing her. She sat on top of him, and then he put his condom on. He wanted her to be the first she felt his cock inside her pussy.</p> <p>When he saw his condom on the bed, he started thrusting in and out of her. It took all his conscious will to continue to love her. She looked at him, and he was holding her face as he kissed it. Her breasts bounced and bobbled with each of his strokes. She felt his hard thrusts as he fucked her. He loved how she looked in her panties and bra. When she wore a bra, he could see how her nipples were hard and pushing out. He would kiss them. And then he would suck them.</p> <p>She squeezed his arms as he fucked her. He moved faster, and she felt his muscles tightening. Then he started to moan, and the feeling of his body tensed. He grabbed her face tightly. He could smell her pussy on his mouth.</p> <p>'Fuck me, Marius, fuck me.'</p> <p>She moaned. He could taste her pussy as he made his cum deep inside her. It took everything he had not to take something from her, but it had meant so much to him. She could think of little to do with her parents, but it was always his fantasy. Besides, this weekend was to be the start of it. He was going home with his family. As soon as he reached home, he knew it would be one of those events, where he would be with her.</p> <p>And when they were out of town, she would be with him. She would be sleeping with him, but only on weekends, she was going with her parents on one of their nights. Once he came home, she was going with him again, but this time she would be alone. He realized at the same time what he was feeling.</p> <p>They held each other tightly for a moment. She felt safe and protected. He held her close, and then it was quiet again. They kissed for the first time. As they kissed, Marius felt his fingers moving inside her panties again. It was like she wanted to say something. Something that would make him think that that she really did not feel a need to be with him. That something deep inside was missing. It was time to put his mind in the right place. He wanted all the love he could give hers.</p> <p>When the last kiss ended, she looked down at him.</p> <p>'I want to you to make me pregnant,' she whispered, as they hugged one more time.
