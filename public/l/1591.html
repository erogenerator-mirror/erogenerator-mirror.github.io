Quick and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging, and telling her to come very often;</strong> which in all her years of life she had always taken the time to attend.</p> <p>There were few things in their lives that would put their friendship, sexual passion, and their love beyond all that she had accomplished over the years. Yet, there was more to them. She was happy to be a woman, with an important man, with a wonderful man, and with two great kids.</p> <p>Samantha was happy to give back to a man as a woman, with her heart, mind, and body. Her love was still there, but she also had many friends, some of whom were still her friends. She had a wonderful friend in Julie.</p> <p>Samantha had been in the Navy with her husband's company before. She had been a Navy sailor for about a year, and she was now going back home. She wasn't sure if she would ever see the Captain, but, she certainly wouldn't want to leave.</p> <p>In any case, Samantha had just gotten married, and life was going great. She was in love with a wonderful guy, and she loved being a good wife and being a mother.</p> <p>It was with the great love of her life that she married the man, and with the loving of her husband. In no time at all she had moved into the life of a loving spouse. In doing just that, she gave herself to be a loving wife more often than she had in her entire life.</p> <p>Samantha's greatest hope was to find a wonderful man. She had been in love with a wonderful man who gave her everything in life.</p> <p>There's just enough room for Samantha's other side, and there's no doubt that there's a lot more to offer in the bedroom than she thought.</p> <p>But, then, there's no doubt that there might be a lot more in the bedroom than Samantha thinks at the moment.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>"Yes, Sam, yes," Jennifer groaned as she felt a second orgasmic wave wash over her.</p> <p>With her two lovers still fucking her, Jennifer was still lying in bed naked and covered in sweat. There wasn't enough room and for both of them she was naked.</p> <p>Samantha's eyes followed her lover's every move and she enjoyed every moment of each of their love-making. She wasn't about to let these two fall apart.</p> <p>Jennifer had been on more than one sexual encounter in her life. Although she had been with a number of men and women before, she had never allowed a man to really penetrate her. When she made love with a man like Samantha was once, she knew that it would remain an exciting experience.</p> <p>It wasn't just her lover's cock to have in her. It was also with someone who had just given her all those orgasms just as her body was making her feel very much better than her own body was.</p> <p>It didn't matter what they used to do in the bedroom and where they were both fucking, because neither Samantha nor Jennifer had any real desire to ever get caught in any other way.</p> <p>It didn't bother her. She enjoyed sex more than she enjoyed fucking, and there were more than enough men and women she knew who were both good at cocksucking and liked to fuck. But, once the pleasure of a lover's cock was all to her, she didn't have to worry that one of her lovers she had never met was her lover.</p> <p>Besides, Jennifer enjoyed fucking, especially in the presence of her lover's husband. Not to mention watching a man fuck, especially a big-booty female, especially one as big-bottomed as Jennifer was.</p> <p>"I'm ready for a few more things," Jennifer moaned.</p> <p>Samantha watched Jennifer slip down again and took her lover's cock in her hand, rubbing its head against her pussy lips and wetness. Samantha's fingers were busy teasing her nipples when she felt a new set of hands rubbing her body.</p> <p>As Jennifer had started fingering her nipples, the same hand that had been fingering her pussy, stroked Samantha's breasts and slid down her tummy. The fingers traced her pubic crease, which the middle fingers explored and then touched her sensitive spot.</p> <p>Samantha wanted her two lovers to fuck her, but she didn't want to hurry. She wanted the sex to last for as long as it could. She wanted it all; the hot sex, the feeling of a sexy woman stroking her husband, the taste of hot pussy, and lots of cum running out of the corners of her lover's mouth.</p> <p>"I want to be a woman," Samantha's. "now." She wants. She did it all the way.</p> <p></p> <p>"I want to be," she and now as she, now and forever."</p> <p>like she always, now. Now as well and will</p> <p>"fore and forever "fore and always with—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
