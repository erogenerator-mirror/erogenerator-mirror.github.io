Not to be slack and negligent; or loose, and wanton in thy</h4><p><strong>actions; nor contentious, and troublesome in thy conversation; nor to rove and wander in thy fancies and imaginations. Not basely to contract thy soul; nor boisterously to sally out with</strong> thy soul. This was not only a very private and personal moment, but a very private and personal experience as well, an experience of a special love for thee; of having the greatest joy of thy youth.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>I was standing at the counter, my mind whirling, while our hands fanned out to the back of the line, with a few others standing on the other end to us. We had finished our evening drinks and were going to go our separate ways; I had been a great help during my part time job at Bimbo Bimbo's, but my friend and I had not been far behind. As an old man, I had thought back to when I had been younger and wondered about our life to the point that I had no reason to worry about it. While I have no particular interest in the likes and dislikes of the likes or dislikes of the dislikes of the dislikes of the dislikes of the likes of the dislikes, I had wondered a great deal about our life together. My friend, Julie stood behind me, and I thought she had just given me a hug.</p> <p>What had started as a very casual date had suddenly progressed to sexual encounters, and by that time, I could actually feel the warm breath of those around me as the tips of our tongues touched. What had started as a very casual event was now becoming much more. Perhaps it was the alcohol, I may have had a couple drinks in me while we talked but it seemed like we were going to be out together. My friend and I were both in the midst of getting ready for bed. Julie and I were alone just like in the past. As Julie's and my friend were both dressed from the waist down in a short skirt and tube top; a short skirt and tube top; panties, and bras, it seemed to me like we were just having our own fun at this hotel. Not that we had been very loud; instead we were chatting amongst ourselves, and I wondered whether Julie had felt the same way about me.</p> <p>I started to take my shirt up and saw that Julie was reaching behind her for the hem of her skirt. I raised my hands up over her ass cheeks and then slowly pulled her skirt all the way up, making slow circles around the cheeks of her ass. I slowly kissed her neck while working my hand all the way around to her upper chest, and when Julie turned quickly, I began kissing the top of her thigh. Julie lifted her leg just up a bit, giving me room to continue, then lowered it back down to rest her foot where she lifted it also. Julie had always been very tactile. As Julie had been, I had always loved her legs, and now it was just right. My friend was as much of a part of this as we were.</p> <p>As Julie pulled up her leg and I continued kissing between us, I reached behind her to unsnap her bra, and that took care of the rest. I slipped the straps down her arms, and then brought my hands up to rest against her upper chest, while moving them down her front. In an instant my friend's hands were on Julie's bare boob, tweaking her nipples. I was already in position to put my mouth over Julie's nipple, and I could feel it was erect. The combination of my hands caressing Julie's breasts, and my mouth sucking on her nipple, made Julie moan with pleasure as she pushed her bosom up against my head. Julie, meanwhile, was working her fingers into my hair, wanting me to kiss and suck on her nipple.</p> <p>I decided to go for it, after all that we had been through. I reached my hand down between us, and started feeling Julie's panties. My friend's panties, although not very wet, were very slick. She had to be wet, because mine were soaked, too. I slowly slipped my middle finger under the panties, slipping it between her thighs. My friend lifted her hips off the seat, and made me take her panties lower. I kissed her pussy lips one last time, and then slipped my finger through the opening to Julie's vagina. Julie moaned again, and placed her hands on mine. If she was wet before, she was now just as wet. I ran my finger through her lips slowly, feeling them get even dampter, then moved it in a circular motion around and around Julie's pubic hair. I felt the muscles of her inner vagina slowly begin to tense. At the same moment I felt Julie's hands go to the front of me, and she pulled down on my skirt until it was just above mine.</p> <p>Julie's legs were shaking so much that they almost dropped down, but I held them up very still. Her hands went to my head for support while Julie's head. I started pulling her head back. I was face just a distance from Julie's, and pulled her breasts were pressed against my breasts up to Julie's Julie's Julie'sâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
