Let us make good use of it. My case is, as I have told you, almost</strong> a waste of time; my time will come when we are in the proper position."</p> <p>"I love the sound of that," replied Watson. "And yes, Mr. Holmes, I do still love the taste of your spunk. Not only do we have half an hour, here's a good time to get back in bed, to finish what we have started."</p> <p>"That's certainly acceptable, Watson. If you don't mind giving him a little rest," said Holmes. He slipped his hand around his erect dick and stroked a couple fingers up and down, then stopped. "I will do much better with my tongue than with my hand now." He took his dick into his mouth. With his head thrown back, his eyes were closed, and with his mouth open, he moaned a bit as Watson's lips pressed against her skin and gently closed. There was just something about Watson's taste that drove Holmes insane. He'd seen it before—not literally—but in his mind, many times. He'd had his mouth and fingers wrapped around his cock; he'd imagined this moment. Now, his lips wrapped around it, and suctioning him, the sensations became much more erotic. He was lost in the pleasure of Watson's mouth. For him, it was a blissful experience. In fact, it was as sweet as he'd thought it would be.</p> <p>"Okay, Mr. Holmes," Watson said, her lips still around him. "My tongue is about halfway inside. I really want to suck you off. As a matter of fact, I'm going to suck you until you cum, and then you'll leave my mouth, naked as a board, and we will consummate our marriage, right here, right now."</p> <p>She slid up the bed, onto her knees. Her eyes were locked on his, and, for the first time, she leaned over to kiss him. He sucked in a sharp breath as their lips touched. His tongue probed her mouth—not the first time; this was just the first time, he told himself. The feelings were indescribable. It seemed as though he were being kissed on his most intense of secrets—their most sacred of secrets.</p> <p>They kissed again, this time with more passion. Their lips were parted, he could see their tongues caressing each other, as they shared their forbidden taste in their mouths. Watson's tongue darted around his wet lips, while his dick thrust upward, trying to find those lips.</p> <p>Her tongue moved around him, as well, as she slipped the tip of her tongue into her mouth and teased his teeth. Watson continued kissing him, her body straddled him for support as he raised his hips against hers. "Mmm," she moaned, "I want you inside me. Right now." She leaned forward, taking his face in her hands and turning it to one side. Her lips moved out from his and she kissed him deeply—teasing him. She licked along his lips, then kissed down to his neck.</p> <p>"Mmm," she whispered in his ear, as she placed her hand on his chest, pressing her body hard against his—as if to push him closer to her. She was pressing him against her, as she licked all along his neck, with her tongue and kissed him a little lower on his chest—only to be met by his mouth.</p> <p>"Oh, my God!" exclaimed Watson as her lips came in contact with his nipple.</p> <p>"I know. I want you so badly." But Watson's words didn't register in his brain. He had no idea how to get her to do something like that. She kissed his nipple, one knuckle at first; but then kissed his other ear. She was sucking on it more and more forcefully; and he knew that in her, as well.</p> <p>"Mmm, it's so hard," she whispered, as she rolled her tongue back and forth across his hard nipple, and she ran her hands around his waist and pulled him toward her. Then she kissed him just below his left nipple, and ran her hands over both of his nipples simultaneously, as if in a dream.</p> <p>Now his entire world seemed to have come to a complete halt, but that didn't matter. Just when he wanted a chance to breathe, and was about to ask a question in a different language, his world seemed to turn back inside out:</p> <p>What are you doing here? It's my night to tell," he said, trying not to sound as though he felt like he sounded like an idiot. Instead he sounded like an idiot.</p> <p>You tell me if it is wrong. You're the wrong. Now go away from me when you are you can't. You're not I like. I like I don't like you; you're just where you, and I.</p> <p></p> <p>I think.
