THE RELIGIOUS MOOD</h4><p><strong>45. The human soul and its limits, the range of man’s inner experiences hitherto attained, the heights, depths, and distances of these experiences, the entire history of the soul UP</strong>, the limits, and the depths of its innermost experiences thus taught was in the past and beyond, here I am, ready to fuck, waiting, waiting to fuck.</p> <p>For the past five months, I've been fucking my man!</p> <p>The thought has made me feel like a whore.</p> <p>I love the feeling of cumming in his cock! It makes my pussy throb and my cunt get moister and wetter for it! I was ready, just as you asked. As soon as his first load of cum hit my pussy lips, I let out a squirt and I screamed!!!</p> <p>As his second load was squirted into my body, I felt my pussy walls tighten as a wave of ecstasy shot through my body. We were no longer man and fucking! We were one. We were fucking!</p> <p>I screamed into the night air because of this second act of my body, this second act of loving man. Our souls were connected. We were united in total lust. We were a complete package.</p> <p>I smiled as he lay on the bed next to me and began to kiss my tits and face, softly running little kisses down my neck to my tits. His lips moved down to my neck as he slowly tongued and sucked on my tits. The thought of him sucking on my tits while cumming inside me, I wanted to suck him some more! His warm kiss covered me with soft, sensual lips. It had been so long.</p> <p>"Honey, you're going to fuck them harder then you fucked me!" I thought.</p> <p>He lay his head on my breasts while his tongue traced my nipples, from my tits all the way down my stomach to my belly button. He was still kissing me, his body warm against mine.</p> <p>I was on the verge of going to my second peak and his cock was still throbbing inside of me. I felt a sense of completion that he was fucking me without any concern for his orgasm! I felt like a dirty slut; my body was on complete fire! It was like I was not even there but was completely surrounded by him. I felt his strong arms wrap tightly around me as we kissed. I could feel my nails scratch and scratch inside his shirt. His hands traveled from my tits down my abdomen to my pussy lips which were soaked with his cum, still clinging to his cock as I slowly pushed his hands up my body.</p> <p>When his hands reached my pussy lips I wanted his hands back down my waist and on my hips that were thrust my hips further. This was so different! He could do everything he wanted but I wanted to have him touching me! I wanted to feel him, feeling him inside me! For the moment I wanted to feel all I had. I wanted to feel him cum inside me! I wanted to feel his hot cum filling me as I fucked him. The fact that he made me feel so good made me feel so submissive!</p> <p>Before I could feel his cock going deeper into my body, his entire body grabbed in and he fucked me as if I was a cock, which I should not be.</p> <p>"Oh my Sweet Tommy, I Love you!" I moaned into his mouth.</p> <p>"I love you, too, darling!" he said with his mouth just above mine!</p> <p>His mouth moved further down to kiss mine and his tongue began to dart inside my mouth as he fucked me, harder and harder still. The feeling of our bodies going as one as our mouths opened wider. Our arms were trembling as our tongues fucked, caressed, probed, and licked each other.</p> <p>I felt his cock throbbing and pulsating within me and realized his cum was still inside me, if not. It was in me, in my pussy too. Feeling his cum in me and filling me with his manhood was so wonderful!</p> <p>His legs wrapped around me and began to lift me up in his arms, moving me with his cock. His kisses moved from my mouth down my forehead to my eyes where his lips would be just under my left cheek. His lips touched my nose, on my lips, my chin, my cheeks, my lips, as his face moved over into my eyes where he would look into my eyes in the darkness of night.</p> <p>His hands lifted me and dropped me on his cock, my body sliding against his as his weight pinned me down until my legs straddled his thighs. Our mouths had moved from one another; our bodies moved against each other, as one soul. Our bodies were touching against each other, pressing with one hand, against each other's lips and our body parts.</p> <p>I was feeling how his hard cock pulsating inside my body.</p> <p>Oh God's cock inside my body He's cock felt Our souls Our souls, souls Our souls We We can—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
