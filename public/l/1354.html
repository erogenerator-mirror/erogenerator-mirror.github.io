Locusta</h4><p><strong>Valentine was alone; two other clocks, slower than that of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule, struck the hour of midnight from different directions, and excepting the rumbling of a few carriages all was silent.</strong> The night would be young...</p> <p>I was still horny when I got up to the loft. I got up and got into the bathroom. I took my clothes off and stepped into the shower. The water felt sweet as I soaped myself up. I looked at my body in the mirror, taking the shower head and running it through my hair. My hair was cut short and cut to just above the crack of my breasts. My body's curves were tight as it stretched all the way in, but still... It felt good to be with my man. I looked down at the glass showerhead and couldn't help but smile, the feeling of the water making my breasts rise and fall. I grabbed my soap bar and poured some soap over it, then worked it all over my body, starting with the head of my cock.</p> <p>The feeling was wonderful, almost as good as the shower did the other thing. I took my arms and pulled myself to the bottom of the bathtub. The water hit the back of me, then just ran down past my thighs. In order to stay clean I stepped forward. The showerhead was directly ahead of me, and I looked down as it slid over my stomach.</p> <p>I stood behind my man and just let myself feel the water. I never stopped loving him though, that perfect cock just the way it is. I washed my hair, running the tingles right down my body to my pussy. It's always been that way, not wanting to just feel the sensation of the water and just being able to do it again.</p> <p>I was still holding my shower nozzle and the other thing which I did want to do was make myself cum. I wanted to feel the same pleasure as my man, even if it was just from the shower. I couldn't help but remember that beautiful body as I washed it, making myself cum thinking it. It was just what I wanted. I looked at the waterhead. It was the perfect way to feel the water hit the back of my body as I ran the water over my body, making me cum. It was pure pleasure I had, the sensation I was about to feel. I slid my body out of the bathtub and turned around.</p> <p>I grabbed my shampoo bottle and the bottle of body wash and the shampoo in a towel, then turned around, getting the body wash out of the other towel and a bottle of body wash. I walked over to the shampoo bottle and took the body wash, letting it run over my fingers as I started to lather up. I started to lather my body, starting with the middle finger, then using it from my other hand to my palm. I slid the finger around my middle finger, getting my finger extra suds and the rest of my bodywash. My nipples were hard as they rubbed against my body. My cock was hard again like it had been before I washed up. I slowly ran the showerhead over my ass. I closed my eyes and let the water slide over my body. The feeling of the water was incredible as you get a towel and soap from a soap bar. The sensation of the shower head sliding over my body was just the perfect sensation to reach.</p> <p>I slid my ass a little lower, then ran my showerhead up my crack. The feeling of the showerhead sliding up and down my crack was delicious, causing my cock to jump to attention as it touched my skin. As good as the feeling was, it was nothing compared to the feeling of my hands spreading the showerhead. The feeling of my body, my hands, my body... the feeling was electric.</p> <p>I slid my back up some more and felt the wetness of the shower gel against the inner portion of my ass. I ran the water over my ass and pussy, rubbing the foam against each wall. Slowly my back got closer to the glass shower head. Finally my hands felt the pleasure of a powerful showerhead on my ass and my cock was rock hard inside.</p> <p>As my hands were going higher and higher, my cock started to reach out against my leg. My heart was racing as it did so, trying hard to stay focused. I looked around, but didn't see anyone. The water was nice though, the cool water flowing over my body as I touched myself was making me feel so good. I stood up and stepped into the shower. The water ran on my chest down over my stomach, and I watched as the water dripped from my body as it ran over it. It felt so good to run my hands over my body as it ran down past the bottom of my breasts and back up, almost touching my cock. I moved the shower head to where it was most comfortable. I wanted to do it on my stomach and back up to my tits, but not at my cock, which did so much easier to move to my tits down, instead to a little and lower. I moved the shower, and got my cock, againâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
