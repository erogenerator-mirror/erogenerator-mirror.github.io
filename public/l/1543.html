English by Niccolò Machiavelli </h3><h4>CHAPTER XXVI — AN EXHORTATION TO LIBERATE ITALY FROM THE BARBARIANS</h4><p><strong>Having carefully considered the subject of the above discourses, and wondering within myself whether the present times were propitious to a new prince, and whether there were elements that would</strong> ensure a new record of new life, the subject of the past, came up in my mind. It's just an example of a long-held fear. But a time was past and there was a great future ahead for my dear friends. And while some were anxious about being a new ruler, others weren't. With little time to consider them, I reached down into the nightstand drawer and took out the long-used blue cock; it was already rock-hard, and the veins running down the shaft and over the head of it were bulging as though they might burst at any moment. I knew he and I would need a lot of lube to put this monster up my pussy, however, and I decided against wasting time planning on doing so on our anniversary. I would just have to get him ready for me.</p> <p>The young man lay there, half-asleep, his body spasming so many times that it would have seemed like he might snap for two to three seconds. His cock was now pulsating so hard he was pushing the material with every beat of his heart. Not able to wait any longer, I crawled on all fours, grabbed his hand, and slid it up the inside of my thighs. Using the other hand, I put the tip of the dildo and the cock-head against my pussy lips. I took a deep breath to draw my first real cock, and then leaned forward and kissed my young lover passionately. With my cock-head still in his mouth, I gently pushed it into me. Once I was completely engulfed in hot lubricant and had taken him completely into me, I wrapped my arms around him as he lay there on his back with his fingers still buried inside me. He must have been as exhausted as I was; I could feel him trying to catch his breath. It was the only thing I could do to keep from falling on him and breaking our kiss.</p> <p>After a long second, I pulled back and then pushed myself back on him, fully impaling myself on his stiff dong. I lowered myself down again until it just barely brushed my cervix before I raised myself up once more, and then I moved back down again. I started rocking my hips, feeling the slickness of the lubricant on my sensitive cock-head. His moans were barely detectable in the darkness of the bedroom; instead of becoming one continuous string of moans, we became one continuous stream of sounds which each of us simultaneously joined. I began moving my hips in time to my lover's thrusts, working him even more deeply inside of me, while still kissing him. As his hand roamed down my back, he began to run it down to my hip, then up to the curve of my butt-cheeks. And in the process he began to explore my asshole. The sensation was too much for him to handle. He grabbed and squeezed both cheeks even harder, and my moans, which increased in intensity and volume, were now mixed with short, quick gasps and growls. "Ohhhhh. I'm sorry sweetheart. I'm coming...."</p> <p>But my lover didn't have a clue, either. He had been waiting her for hours to do so, but didn't want to let her down for too long. He rolled his hips so that his crotch was still pressed against my ass. He reached around me with both hands, pulling and squeezing my body tightly against his, kissing me passionately as I kept rocking my hips. After a few moments, I slowed down my movements and raised myself up off his engorged cock again, sliding around until he was fully in, then plunging down on it again as I came back up to once more make up for the lack of a moment's rest. Once he had begun moving in and out of me again, my lover would begin sliding his hands down to my hips, pulling and pushing them back against him, then pulling them back and forth, fucking me with his cock. He was going on and on, alternating between slow and fast fucks, sometimes pushing all the way up so as if he was fucking my ass with his cock - sometimes pulling all the way out and then all the way back in and thrusting himself hard up my slickness. His hands were still behind me, caressing my shoulders, pinching my nipples gently and running their fingers over the ridges of my breasts, until he finally pushed my shoulder to roll me over onto my back again, and slid his long cock back into me once more. The feeling of power was building inside me, the power of his fucking, the control he now held over me, the control of my body. There was no getting out of the way, there was no one way to stop it now. Finally as he had thrusting it deep into me one last time so as far as he could, the full force could go, he did, and let it shoot it, he did it... I would let it - I had it cum—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
