M. Montgomery </h3><h4>CHAPTER XXXVI. The Glory and the Dream</h4><p><strong>ON the morning when the final results of all the examinations were to be posted on the bulletin board at Queen’s, Anne and Jane walked down the street together. Jane</strong> was wearing a thin white blouse and a tight navy-blue miniskirt. Anne wore a very fashionable, very sexy pink button-up blouse with a black skirt that was very short. Both were wearing high-waisted blouses and their buttons undone enough to give each a peek at their cleavage.</p> <p>“You”s is always my favorite color,” Jane said. She and Anne were wearing matching lipstick and nail polish. When looking at Anne's blouse, she could tell she was wearing a very tight-fitting blouse, showing a very nice amount of cleavage. All the while, Jane knew her husband was watching her from across the street. And, she had a very sexy smile, even with no clothing of her own.</p> <p>“I love seeing you wearing your sexy lipstick. This is so sexy. That’s so sexy baby.”</p> <p>“I bet that feels good. Do you think you will let me kiss you tonight?”</p> <p>“Oh yes, if it feels sexy enough for you.”</p> <p>She knew her husband would be watching as well. Especially after Anne had her hair styled. Anne and Jane had just finished with her makeup. Tonight they would take off their tops and then start their make-overs. Then, they would go out on the town.</p> <p>“How about tomorrow night?”</p> <p>“Sure. Why not?”</p> <p>“Great. Then, maybe Anne and I can spend the night together. We both have to work the next night. Then, we can go to your family’s place.”</p> <p>“Yes. That sounds wonderful. What time do you want me up at nine?”</p> <p>“I better make sure everything is up to speed so you don’t forget. I can see you are still feeling horny.”</p> <p>“Oh, that’s perfect. Just the way I like it.”</p> <p>“Well, I bet you do, too. I know you. But, you are not exactly used to getting all of the attention of men. And, I’ll be down when you get up”</p> <p>“Thanks.”</p> <p>And then, the two girls put their tops back on and then went back to their tops. They were ready to go home. But, this time it was so fun having a couple of drinks. Anne and Jane had a very sexy and exciting time together after they got home. They both felt very sexy, with their outfits showing the most of their breasts to anyone who stood close enough to them.</p> <p>“Come home to fuck me.”</p> <p>“Okay!”</p> <p>“Honey, I’m horny,” Jane said to herself. But then, she giggled. <~Thanks for reading This Is A Wonderful Day in the Making today. I hope you enjoyed it. The more you read, the better it will be.
