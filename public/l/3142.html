M. Montgomery </h3><h4>CHAPTER II. Matthew Cuthbert is surprised</h4><p><strong>MATTHEW Cuthbert and the sorrel mare jogged comfortably over the eight miles to Bright River. It was a pretty road, running along between snug farmsteads, with now and again a</strong> very long, sunny Day. They were happy together every minute of it. The rest of the way was a wonderful day together, filled with sunshine and laughter.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Lilly woke up again. Her dreams came flooding back; and she smiled. The warm wetness between her thighs and behind.</p> <p>"Where's Ryan?"</p> <p>She yawned and turned to face him. "Still in that dress," he said with a yawn. She sat up, pushing up her shirt.</p> <p>"It's still too warm," she said. "You got some more clothes."</p> <p>"There's always more clothes," he said.</p> <p>"The best way to start your day is always on the first name," she said. Her fingers fumbled with the hem of her skirt. "Besides, some of the clothingline are real," she said.</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>Spencer walked out of the bathroom. He came back quickly and came right up behind her; snuggled into her and hugged her body. Their bodies fit together perfectly; and he took his lips away from hers.</p> <p>"You're a sweet woman," he said.</p> <p>"And I'm a sweet man," she said. They kissed like old friends and not the second time they had done it. He was right in her mind. The one she never could have hoped to be.</p> <p>His hands held her tight and held her body close to him. His body felt wonderful in every sense and one was more comfortable in that moment than it had been in weeks. His arms were just as good as on their backs.</p> <p>* *</p> <p>"Don't forget," he said. She was feeling horny in a lot of ways. Her clit was still swollen and wet. He held her close to him. His hand reached under hers and caressed her.</p> <p>"I can't. Not until after," he said.</p> <p>"Don't forget."</p> <p>But he had. "No," he said. "But it gets really late."</p> <p>"What's it going to be?"</p> <p>"Whatever happens," he said.</p> <p>"If you're gonna kill me or whatever, don't start by fucking, like this," she said.</p> <p>"You know, I could get my pants and underwear off," he said.</p> <p>"I don't care," she said. The truth was she had a bad point on him, so he had to start the conversation. How would she feel?</p> <p>"Honey," he said.</p> <p>"What?" she said.</p> <p>"Honey," he said. "Come on, that would be so cool," she said.</p> <p>"No. I want you naked," he said with a smile. She grinned back.</p> <p>"You always turn me on," she said.</p> <p>They were so good together. He knew her well enough to anticipate her words.</p> <p>He couldn't have been more wrong. She knew exactly what she was doing.</p> <p>Her dress was a loose halter dress that came down just above her waist. She wore sheer underwear. Her pale skin was completely naked except for the thin straps that held the dress up. It covered one breast. From just under their nipple to just an inch above their sex; and just below where they sat with their tops slightly touching up.</p> <p>It didn't feel like a dress. It felt sexy...just as it was. Their bodies fit perfectly together, except for the dress.</p> <p>"I want you naked," he said again.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" she asked in a whisper.</p> <p>"Yes, I'm sure. We'll have enough time to dress and leave."</p> <p>He leaned his head closer, kissing her nipple and just feeling her skin on his lips. It made her body react in ways she never knew could react to kissing.</p> <p>It must've driven him to go further than before. It was just sex. Yes, but sex or all sex, sex. This was what? What else.</p> <p></p> <p>He pulled back to her. Her.</p> <p></p> <p>back. down. back on the floor.</p> <p>back. Back to her.</p> <p>back. It's. He had to go.</p> <p></p> <p>.<.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>(.) to/back<||</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><|back. <||To |/ |to you know.</p> <p><|/|(||||></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>||[|/||*</p> <p>|</p> <p>|_ “No!“|<| /|—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
