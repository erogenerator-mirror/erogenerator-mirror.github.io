She had called on her former</strong> teacher with a plan to save their marriage. They had known it and had resolved it with a determination to make God a living. And now, it was Laura's husband.</p> <p>They had decided to remain friends in the eyes of God, so they were. They had no plans. He would marry her. She was too young. They weren't going to marry. They were married.</p> <p>So she had changed her appearance on the day God sent her there. She stood five feet tall and had a slim, lithe body that most people would find attractive. She had nice, round breasts, and she had a narrow waist and an even tighter waistband. She had the curves of a goddess. And she had a heart-stopping ass. And she loved wearing short skirts, and she had very high high heels on.</p> <p>And when they were on the side, he had always been there, always being there. He was always smiling, and he had always made a good first impression for her. There wasn't a moment in all those years when He hadn't greeted her, always so sweet and loving. And tonight, however, He had kissed her, and they had kissed in public, not in a romantic way. And in a loving way. But they were here, on this romantic night, and tonight, it would be just a bit different. It wouldn't be every night. And she would have felt the same way when He made love to her. God has always taken care of his bride.</p> <p>And when their kiss broke up, there was a moment of sadness. She was afraid. She wasn't sure what would have happened if He hadn't been there. But when His lips touched her cheek, she could tell that she was falling into his arms. He kissed her with tenderness, and there wasn't no more doubt. She had no doubt about how much she loved Him. They had spent many years together. And now, she loved them with the same passion she had loved her childhood. She didn't know what happened between them in that moment. But they were always there. And there was something about seeing them that made them special together. That set a new, strange kind of love in their hearts. And when she wrapped her arms around Him, there was only one thing left to give her heart and soul.</p> <p>And that was her beloved husband. Now that she was in the land of the living, She was going to be the one to give him his first kiss. She smiled when her lips touched his, but she didn't hug Him in return. She kissed him long and gentle with her lips, a kiss that never failed to ignite her passion for Him and cause Him to smile back at her.</p> <p>But tonight, they had gone straight to the bedroom. She went in first. She kissed him gently. She kissed him everywhere. She kissed every inch of his body. She kissed and sucked His cock, which was standing proudly, with one arm over his hips while she had his hand on her ass while they were kissing, his lips and tongue exploring every surface of her mouth, but when He was not on top of her in bed, he usually used his mouth for kissing her.</p> <p>She took His cock in her mouth, first, and then she took his hand and led it over her pussy, where she had an instant reaction. She was already wet before they made love, and it took less time to get him hard than it should. And she loved his cock, because she would have loved anything else, but she had to say how much she loved him. And she did.</p> <p>She looked into His eyes as she sucked the tip of his cock. She loved the sight of her blonde-haired, angel-like face gliding across Him, His perfect white teeth shining in the moonlight, all of who it was she belonged with. When she put his cock in her mouth, she imagined that it was Him, and that she would always have chosen her husband the night before her wedding. Tonight, she would have chosen her husband to be the one to take her away once and for all. And then she smiled.</p> <p>They rolled onto their sides, and she was on her knees, waiting patiently. He loved to see her on the bed, the sexy, confident, sexy teacher kneeling before Him. She was the most passionate of any of her students, and now, she was His to teach. After all that was still yet to come.</p> <p>The words were all he could say.</p> <p>All his friends in heaven's eyes would say. They would say, You know, that.</p> <p></p> <p>This. "We can't love, she was meant the love</p> <p>He was the moment.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>For He felt the moment. But the moment</p> <p>They would stand. He could love</p> <p></p> <p>For us And, we could notâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
