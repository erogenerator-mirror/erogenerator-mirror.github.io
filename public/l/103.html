October 9, 1890.</h4><p><strong>Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both</strong> enjoyed.</p> <p>'I'm sorry' had been our pre-emotional declaration, after the first fuck we'd had. Now we were both feeling the deep stab of that initial shock. We had fucked, and, if my eyes had registered that I was now going to be making this all more real, they wouldn't have been the most recent and more real fuck we'd had over a decade. There hadn't been much that we hadn't done, or perhaps, hadn't wanted to do, and as with our previous sexual exploits, it was as though there were only a bunch of memories, a few moments of pleasure, and then some later, if we had enjoyed ourselves. No regrets, none. Just a lot more sex.</p> <p>The following week was the weekend before Thanksgiving and we planned the day's activities accordingly. I'm sure at some point on Thanksgiving night that we would be at my place, where we'd be sleeping, and I'd have a chance to catch a bit of my wife. I had been planning to fuck her all week, at least before the holidays. Of course there were some details that I didn't quite know, and a couple of times when we had been busy that she'd not been ready, we'd still need to fuck to make the weekend memorable, but as soon as it was feasible, we would probably just fuck ourselves to sleep. No promises, no expectations, no pressure. No.</p> <p>We arrived at her place in Columbus and parked, with our hands around each other's waists and our faces pressing into each other's eyelids, and immediately set up our hotel room. We'd just changed into our nightclothes. It was dark, a big one that we'd been planning for days. No other lights on in the house. Just a pale room to start, maybe even a nightcap in our room.</p> <p>We spent ten minutes in the small, dimly lit bedroom, kissing, caressing, and generally taking in as much of the outside of ourselves as we could. I was always feeling so aroused by being in the first two stages of sexual activity, being fucked, and being made love to. I was also feeling the desire to fuck. This time though it really was only my wife, that I was fucking. It almost seemed surreal.</p> <p>It was as though she was fucking me, instead, for just as I was turning away she was taking me into the dark bedroom, and I was taking her into it.</p> <p>'It's not fair,' came my conscience as I felt her first tentative lips kiss me. 'You're so sexy, and I'm so happy that you're mine. It's not fair that I was the only one getting all naked in there and having sex.'</p> <p>I kissed her back. 'You're so sexy, and I'm so happy that you're having fun.' As I said it just, I felt her naked body. Her little breasts, that had once been so pretty, standing proud with such large tips, her nipples, those areola with little, hard buds, were now a hard pink and very inviting.</p> <p>'So I'm the only one having sex with a sexy woman, especially someone so special and so beautiful, and that's what's turning us on.'</p> <p>I could feel her nipples getting harder, poking down against my chest. Then I felt her hands slide down my body and, finally, into my bush. We were in the middle of a bed, the middle of only a few places. She was still on her back, so her legs were splayed in front of me, and her knees were bent, so as she continued to kiss me her hand was still wrapped around my dick.</p> <p>I couldn't hold back any longer. I wasn't sure, even for me, that she was fully aware of what was happening, but, to be honest I started to feel that sexual excitement I'd experienced on numerous occasions before. I'd felt it with my wife. We'd all done it before. Maybe a few. But not now. Not with her, not with my own daughter on top of me. Not that I knew how I felt about her like this. But, this time, that was happening, as our bodies were in close proximity, and I think we were both feeling that desire now. The feeling of our bodies touching, touching her.</p> <p>The first kiss with her felt like a long and wonderful eternity. Just a quick peck on the lips. I could feel something starting to swell in my head as I pressed my lips firmly against her chest, and felt her arms wrapping themselves round me, and I could her head dropping onto my shoulder. I couldn't stop myself any longer, and I heard her say, 'Oh my God, God, you're a real big strong, I thought. We'll keep taking you're not so strong.'</p> <p></p> <p>Oh yes' oh I knew.
