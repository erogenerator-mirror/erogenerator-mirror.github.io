To the civil inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she</strong> found that her husband was an unrepentant, albeit rather less cockless fellow.</p> <p>Her husband sat beside her dressed in his usual dress clothes. Elizabeth stood up, smoothed down his shirt tails and buttoned his trousers. Then with a flourish she was in a pale green top, her hair in a large blue braid hanging from a gold collar, and her long gown flowed down to reveal her naked back.</p> <p>She gave way to the meal. Her husband asked her to stand. She did not wait. She took his hand from his trousers, and pressed it to her mouth. They kissed and the dress parted, and his hand slipped inside her robe to caress her breasts. She groaned with pleasure as his fingers began to tweak her nipples.</p> <p>"We can't leave the wine."</p> <p>But her husband was too much of a gentleman, and they decided to leave on their ways. Elizabeth opened her robe and allowed the dress to fall to the floor. She stepped out of it, and walked back to the kitchen.</p> <p>'He's still looking at me.'</p> <p>She heard footsteps. She was still in their garden outside.</p> <p>'We should be getting back. He'll love it too.'</p> <p>'You're too beautiful.'</p> <p>'Oh really?'</p> <p>'I'll find out soon.'</p> <p>Their garden grew thick with flowers. She reached up to caress the hard tips of their long and upright breasts. Their nipples were hard. Elizabeth knew she liked to be able to do things to them which would drive them wild.</p> <p>Her husband stepped towards her.</p> <p>'Oh my... you're lovely!'</p> <p>She didn't stop him. She felt her gown falling to the floor. Now she stood before him in a pink, lace corset that clung so much to her generous bosom from her waist upwards. Her nipples pushed outwards. Then she stood still. She wanted to ask him what he was all about, if he was all about her. Then she knew she shouldn't, she shouldn't have been thinking of such things! But now in all her nakedness...</p> <p>'There's the coffee?'</p> <p>And it was there, in front of a sofa. She crossed the room and sat down behind the sofa. She was in the middle, of course. He moved closer. Her husband had already removed his shoes and was about to remove his trousers. She saw his hands undoging the belts. He looked at her face for a moment as if he had expected her to resist. Then his trousers fell. And he stepped out of them. He was wearing a dark blue under garment, and his erection pointed proudly forwards. Her husband reached out and touched the underside of the tip of the tip of his erection. She saw him smile at her, but she still didn't have the courage to move. His fingers trailed up and down her spine and then slid into the small of her back.</p> <p>It seemed to her that he wanted her to move.</p> <p>'It wouldn't be cheating. I want to kiss the top of your breast.'</p> <p>That was something a true man would do.</p> <p>His fingers pressed firmly against the front of her. She felt hot and slick with passion. It was a good feel, but it was what she needed. She moaned as his fingers traced all round her breasts. Then he knelt down in front of her. His fingers slipped lower and lower.</p> <p>He opened her dress and exposed her breasts. He pressed her breasts together so he could get his hands all over them. She felt herself moistening. It was exciting. How could it be cheating? Just as his fingers slid over her nipples...</p> <p>'No. That's not cheating. That's what I just wanted you to feel. I know you're shy.'</p> <p>She was ashamed to admit that she found a man's touch exciting.</p> <p>'I know. You're a sexy man. Can't I trust you?'</p> <p>She was relieved to find that her nipples were aching for him to continue.</p> <p>But for that he was right again, he had brought his lips to her nipples. He pressed his lips to them.</p> <p>She wanted to tell him that he shouldn't, that it wasn't a good idea to kiss a woman's breasts, but the sensation so excited her that she moaned just then. She saw her husband's lips move away from her breasts, but in the distance, and she felt his tongue trace a line on her left nipple. She gasped with pleasure.</p> <p>'You feel so good... Don't you want to kiss me more?'</p> <p>'Yes, I want to kiss you more.' her husband replied.</p> <p>. Her body quivered with a sudden excitement. and a soft sigh of wanting more. More and a shudderment of pleasure, but a yearning.</p> <p>.</p> <p></p> <p>, that his lips—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
