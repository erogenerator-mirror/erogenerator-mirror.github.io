Her ex-husband had always preferred her in missionary because of the angle of his body, so they never lasted long. Their first orgasm was very good. Jane really loved to have sex, she was already extremely aroused, as she recalled his hot body against hers and her orgasm coming, the excitement in watching as the condom slid off. And the first orgasm was even better than Elizabeth's.</p> <p>Now for her first time she had to settle for missionary position.</p> <p>Her ex had never fucked her with long, fat cocks, but her ex-husband had tried, and she had tried, but he always came rather quickly.</p> <p>And to top things off, she'd fucked the man who'd just dumped a big load of cum all over her.</p> <p>She couldn't do this though, her face and chest were hot and flushed, she was already aroused. The thought of being fucked by a man who had just cum in her mouth made her pussy throb even more intensely than ever; she felt a powerful urge to cum. She couldn't wait until morning to see what he thought about it.</p> <p>She closed her eyes. And after all the years she'd spent as an amateur porn star, the idea of being watched made her orgasm so much more intense. In fact, that orgasm really was something else - a release of power, from which a woman couldn't get off alone, and in her case the idea of being watched gave her that release of pleasure.</p> <p>She opened her eyes again before slipping away from the thought. She smiled. She'd just had a wonderful orgasm with a big black man, and with his cum and her vaginal juices all over it, she felt very desirable and sexually aggressive. She opened her eyes, put on her bathrobe and headed for the stairs.</p> <p>Elizabeth liked to walk the whole way upstairs, letting the feelings from her body wash over her, her eyes closed to take in the sight of her long, beautiful black mane. It was a long, very enjoyable walk. And while walking downstairs she felt the familiar tingle of arousal that her walking made.</p> <p>The house was dark.</p> <p>She closed the glass patio door and walked to the steps. She'd only made them a couple of steps back, so she was pretty sure the top step was locked. She reached the top step and turned the key. "Hello?"</p> <p>She didn't hear a reply. Maybe she thought that's it; maybe she'd make a sudden decision to let them see her. Maybe she'd make a choice and they'd just come upstairs at the right time to talk - and have a drink. "Whoa, wait a minute."</p> <p>Instead of listening to him, she heard a voice say her name. She turned the key, pulled the door open and looked at him. She looked like a woman who'd just received a big, heavy orgasm. A man of almost 50 years with a large, well-proved penis. And when she looked at her own reflection, she almost looked as if she was half as attractive as she felt.</p> <p>He wasn't all there, just big and masculine. His face, with a very masculine look, was hard and determined, his eyebrows had drawn up and were a rich shade of black. He had a big, dark head, but the rest was fairly smooth, and the beard was neatly trimmed, with just a couple of strands of hair on his chin that she noticed when she looked closer. His arms were large and muscular, and the muscles appeared well past his shoulders. But even when she looked at her own reflection she could see that she was very much a woman. She'd never felt so naked before in her life. She wondered if her lack of breasts were causing him trouble. She liked to look at herself in the mirror when she was masturbating.</p> <p>"You're awfully hot, you know. Are you turned on?"</p> <p>She didn't answer.</p> <p>"I'm just trying to help."</p> <p>"Sorry." "Thanks. I just don't feel right about it."</p> <p>"I don't either. It's not fair for us to have to be dressed like this." He reached and pulled the light switch.</p> <p>She looked at him. "And what might we wear?"</p> <p>"I don't know yet." He laughed. "I think I've got some clothes. What do you think?"</p> <p>"I think you're sexy." She liked to look at him that way, that way and she liked to look at him that way - because he was really sexy. "I was just going to get some clothes, but I guess I could change into another one of those ones."</p> <p>"Do you're sexy?" ' I like to do?" " I like to think?"</p> <p>She loved to?"</p> <p>" if youâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
