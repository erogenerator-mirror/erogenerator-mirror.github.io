English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>LXIV. THE LEECH.</h4><p><strong>And Zarathustra went thoughtfully on, further and lower down, through forests and past moory bottoms; as it happeneth, however, to every one who meditateth upon hard matters, he trod thereby</strong> upon the land and, to his amazement and horror, the very ground that he had inhabited. "But..." Zarathustra murmured, "I can get pregnant," and he started to protest that he would never allow it, but now Zarathustra knew no different. He had been a virgin from the time that he had been born to him. "Do it," he said, and he held his penis, which was still somewhat shriveled to the point that it was just as long and thick as his finger. He held his cock in his hand and looked at it: "I've not had my own cock."</p> <p>"But, my husband, let me," Zarathustra said, his eyes flashing up to a full, knowing smile, and he held his cock. Without any further ado, he put his hands to the sides of his buttocks and spread his legs. "But it's not the right time now!" He smiled back at Zarathustra: "I don't have a long life anymore! It will be just as good when you're on your back, while I'm at the mercy of my body!"</p> <p>At this, Zarathustra was almost in tears, but his voice came to him. "It is now my duty, for you to take me inside!" He pulled it out, and in a gesture of encouragement, he turned around, and mounted himself on Zarathustras. "Now it will be our duty as husband and wife!" He was looking at the same face of his father! It was very strange for him, because he did not want to be a wife of his own. He thought of his mother's face and then to have her hand. He wanted to make use of it; as though the woman would have a cock and she would take the wife from him. The woman would take the husband, and in turn, it could be said that he would be the wife of his father. But a husband like him shouldn't have anything to offer a woman. How should it be possible for a man to be a husband? And it might have been only when the husband was married to a boy.</p> <p>Zarathustra was very aroused when he had penetrated Zarathustras, and his cock was hard and twitching. It was getting really hard now, and he began to fuck, taking his rod in and out of Zarathustras' wet and slick cunt. Zarathustras opened her legs as he began to fuck, and he fucked her with wild abandon: "Fuck my cunt! Fuck it all! Make me take your sweet prick!" The sound of wet, slimy skin sliding on wet, sticky skin grew louder and clearer: "Oh you must fuck me all the time, like a whore! Now I can take your sweet prick!" Zarathustra was beginning to enjoy her own fuck, so he reached under the woman's legs and rubbed her clitoris as he continued to fuck her. "Do you like that? You must have liked it when you were watching me!" Zarathustras, unable to help herself, moaned "Ah, yes, you're so nice! It feels so good! Make me cum now!" She was feeling really full now! That's it, she thought, make it last. She closed her eyes and began to move her hips in a wild rhythm as she began to feel her own juices. She was so excited to feel what Zarathustras was feeling, but she wanted it to last.</p> <p>Then Zarathustras suddenly stopped fucking her: she felt as though she was coming to. She began to move involuntarily as she had her orgasm. She let herself fall on Zarathustras' chest, feeling the soft warmness of his chest. Zarathustras took her breasts in his hands and began to knead them. "Oh, you're good! You really are!" She smiled at him. He looked over at her, and he was amazed at her, with his eyes. "My god," he thought, "I do know women as you have them!" He had never known her with sex before, but he found himself amazed that he had been a fool for such a beautiful woman, and his own wife. That it was her who did it to him was something that he had to think about. It was like, for a minute, he was thinking that he was a fool for thinking like that, but it was not to be! He felt the woman's hand, which caressing his cock, and he looked down at it. "Your prick is very hard!" She smiled at him, and he felt his cock start to stiffen. "It would please me to come to come inside you! You!" He was thinking to do this, but he didn't he realized for himself that it was a fool. But his cock grew more he felt as well as it had become hard and he was an old and that timeâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
