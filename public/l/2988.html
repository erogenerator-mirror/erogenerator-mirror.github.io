If he</strong> is Christian, then she is Infidel. If he is Christian, she is Infidel.</p> <p>"God gave us men to love," I told him. "God gave us women to Love. I love a beautiful, strong, beautiful woman, and I wanted her to love me."</p> <p>"That's right you silly boy," God smiled at me. "You've always been like me! You're my favorite. You're my favourite of a girl, and it always gets me more attention than usual! Oh, and you love me!"</p> <p>I can't say if I could say I loved her because it was so obvious. But I certainly loved her because my love for her so completely eclipsed any other man's, and I was in love with her too. Our love made for one another and made for us both, even if only by the actions of the two men who loved us.</p> <p>I can't say I really loved her because there was no other reason for the love. She was my girl. We'd always been so close, and we had so many things to talk about, but our love transcended the actions and decisions of the individual. It is as if we had been so close for so many years. There was no other way to say it.</p> <p>Heidi took my hand. Her kiss was so sweet, and as our passion began to get more intense, my lust was getting stronger. It seemed so difficult. We were both so nervous. It was so bad. Heidi took a step back from me. I had to get down on my knees in front of her. I thought our love would survive what happened.</p> <p>"God, I love you. I'm not sure what to do," I started to say, but she pulled my head against her and pulled my face on her breasts. She ran her right palm down my neck and chest to my stomach. The other hand dropped to my dick. She gently squeezed it, and in a husky voice said, "I love you too."</p> <p>I leaned forward and put my arms around her. She wrapped her arms around me, and I kissed her for the first time. I wanted to go slow, to move slowly, and make love to her until she agreed to me. I could feel her hands on my back as she gently pushed me into her. The kiss was tentative at best, as if that was what she wanted to do. But it was also passionate. Her lips were so soft, so soft, and so incredibly sexy. There was no need to hurry. We were so close. I looked at her. For the first time in my life, I had the thought of doing something that would have been hard on me before, and I'm happy that I felt it. I was also happy it was what God wanted from me.</p> <p>I pulled away from Heidi. Her arms tightened around me and her legs tightened around me. I kissed her again. It was soft, loving, and tender. I had never felt an emotion more sensual. I had never felt anything more right.</p> <p>She whispered to me, "Oh, God," as I kissed her again. Her hands on my back were so gentle. For the first time, I wished there were more than what was between us. It was more than I could have ever imagined, but I was willing to find more.</p> <p>I took the back of her shirt and pulled her back to me, and she grabbed my waist and kissed me again. She was trembling as she kissed me. I could feel her passion. Just the simple touch of her fingertips against the smooth skin of my back and chest was like a caress. I could feel her love deep inside of me.</p> <p>Her kiss made me crazy. I grabbed her ass and we locked lips again. We kissed deep. Our tongues explored each other's mouths. Then we kissed again deeper, and I started to grope into her back as our bodies pressed into each other.</p> <p>Heidi broke our kiss and put her hands on my hips. She began to lift her shirt and we kissed again. "Let's go to your bedroom," she whispered to me.</p> <p>I put my hands up to my mouth as if I didn't know what to do with them. I slowly raised my arm, and kissed her right arm. Heidi smiled as her eyes opened wider. Then she kissed the left arm. Her eyes were closed. I was on my knees at the ready.</p> <p>A minute later, I kissed my way down her neck. I pushed her t-shirt up her body until it hung off her arms. Her bra came off next, and then I took off my boxers and we crawled onto the bed. I was almost in a trance as I knelt next to Heidi. I was only inches away from her beautiful, sensual, naked body.</p> <p>I was looking at a woman who I had never saw before. I had been so many times. I had kissed who I had been so many times Iâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
