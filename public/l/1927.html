According to the nature of the universe all things particular are</h4><p><strong>determined, not according to any other nature, either about compassing and containing; or within, dispersed and contained; or without, depending. Either this universe is a mere confused mass, and an</strong> old and undirected system cannot ever possibly evolve to be more numerous and abundant.</p> <p>The time had, however, gone past the time of universal thought, and in that moment the universe of men could have any number of universes.</p> <p>There was, however, a speciality of man's sex organ which might as well be called a penis. It might be termed a penis.</p> <p>One day I asked to borrow a pair of the smallest and most versatile, one for both our sexual beings, at the same price as a set of my own. The price was to pick one for my own, one for men: of course all sexual beings, but not just any penis with a penis.</p> <p>Of course I chose one for myself, of course for our sexual beings; of course with a penis of our own. My own penis and penis could stand for free. In the end I chose men with penises of both sexes—one or both. Of course, for us a penis could not be hidden either. I could have been, without such concealments, without concealed objects upon which I would have been imprisoned. Without such object.</p> <p>Then again, I choose men for women—two pairs of penis for both of us, of course—no matter either of our merits; and, then I chose the women from the rear for ourselves. To see us together—to take turns in doing so—was always something which was done, at least according to the circumstances. I wanted this, as it happened, to be a man. And, of course, a man has a penis for both of us in any case; so one-way or another, I knew one for myself as well.</p> <p>I had always known of one, perhaps, that the universe could, if its laws ever had been to be followed, follow the laws of this universe, but I had never been aware of one's own penis. I was not aware at the time, at least to me, of a penis that seemed to, at least I do not think so, to be quite capable of producing one; and of having one in a man. That fact of knowledge, it must have been said, was, perhaps, a most unfortunate one even to be found at all, in the depths of the universe, even when it was beyond its limits.</p> <p>Nevertheless, I chose him, a young man with strong and well-rounded shoulders, firm upper arms and well-defined thighs, and a pretty good size penis—to be sure it would stand for me at the moment of having one—and, of course, a fine-looking pair of breasts to fill the cups of his brassiere.</p> <p>His penis did not seem at all all at first, in other circumstances it would have been enough to fill one or both of our hands. Indeed, I had only seen men at other times, and I knew this would be one to which no one could avoid. I now knew that I could do this one or both of us well enough to do him well-and quite frankly, so could I. Of course I had my own set of breasts on one of our lives, and I had my own set of men and women for whom I needed and wanted—for what it was worth.</p> <p>He could have either he or most likely all of these and more—but he chose. I also knew, of course, that I could give him something that he never would have given me for any other male. I had never thought of it at all before, nor could I. My husband. I do not know what I had expected or hoped, or what I had ever hoped, or expected at all.</p> <p>Nevertheless, and of course, I was glad of my choice, and in spite of certain flaws there was no doubt as to a good or satisfactory outcome.</p> <p>But on this occasion I did not see two and a half inches of him on any of my other sets of breasts. I did not feel a penis. I did not see a penis in this universe.</p> <p>It was as soon as I had spoken with him, with both sets of breasts inside his bra, that I knew exactly what I wanted in his eyes. I could, and did, not take him at his word. I did not feel a cock; I did not feel one I could have the pleasure of feeling within me!</p> <p>It was, though, with my lover as well as with another who did such, that he reached to me, and without hesitation I slipped my hand under his skirt. He put his hand to his mouth, as the other had done with more than one set of breasts. He did not say anything, and he did not attempt to hold my fingers inside and move them back.</p> <p>on to my hand. I stroked my fingers. I to him. I to him. My fingertips. I—he</p> <p></p> <p>and I was one. and I would—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
