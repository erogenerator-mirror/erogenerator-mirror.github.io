The forecastle, which lay before buried in sand, was heaved up at least six feet, and the stern,</strong> and I was still conscious. In that short time it had only been five and a half minutes after landing, only the air-carrier and the navigator had made it back onto the main deck. I could see the sea surface was still a dull shade of grey, and I guess the whole ship was dead.</p> <p>And the weather was the way. I had made myself as comfortable as possible, and the air-carrier was doing everything and everything not to do anything as it slowly drew its first wave deep into the ocean at a high velocity. There was enough air in the cockpit to make it last for as long as I liked. And of course there was a chance that the waves could be made in no time at all.</p> <p>And it was too early to go in search of my ship, not even fifty kilometers inland. I had to hurry, for my captain was already asleep at midnight, and I didn't want to wake him up, so I made another break into a long run into the dark. There should've been lights on, but no lights were showing any signs of existence, much as I hoped they might be. I quickly made a sharp exit around the last kilometer or so, and then pulled myself back into the cockpit and got back on it.</p> <p>When I came up to take a leak I noticed a light above the ship. I ran back out to the cockpit and asked the captain if something was wrong with his ship.</p> <p>"They're on the port side. That's why we weren't looking for a search vessel."</p> <p>"They're right above our ship at the far end right now," I confirmed for him.</p> <p>That's when I realized that the light was just from the light in the cockpit so the captain wouldn't see me, like he needed to. "What's down there?" I whispered.</p> <p>"It's a little cloudy."</p> <p>"Couldn't this be heading up toward civilization?"</p> <p>"It might be a mile or so away," the captain answered from the cockpit, and I heard his footsteps coming closer as he approached. "You've been gone over thirty kilometers and another fifty minutes. There might be an area in the sea where a craft may have been docking with the colony ship, but it's nowhere near that big of a city."</p> <p>The captain sighed. "We're going to need to find the next colony ship, though, don't you think?"</p> <p>I laughed.</p> <p>"Is that what you intend to do?" the captain asked.</p> <p>"I intend to sail off the island and look for something in the harbor. What I'm hoping to find there won't be anything there that I could use to bring down," I answered.</p> <p>"Do you know how to sail?" he asked.</p> <p>"I'm an islander," I reminded him, remembering my time on the Island, and it was far too late to tell him that. "This will be the best place for it."</p> <p>"I'm not sure. I've heard that some pirates have done it in there once or twice while I was alive, and even the Captain seems to have been in that kind of a ship before himself," the captain chuckled. "The next time I see him he might just be hiding there."</p> <p>"It would be a great place to hide, wouldn't it?" I asked. "But you've never seen pirates in the harbor before."</p> <p>"I've heard that too."</p> <p>"I hope I haven't disappointed you."</p> <p>"Not at all," I replied, and then I leaned closer to him. "Do you know where you're going?" I added, looking to my left about halfway out of earshot.</p> <p>"Are you interested in finding out?" he asked, the corners of his lips rising up in a smile when he realized what I was offering.</p> <p>"No," I answered simply, knowing that my chances were slim and that I had no way of getting out of that situation. "I just wish that I could find something... useful to do. I'm getting tired of my life."</p> <p>"Maybe we can find something to entertain ourselves," the captain said, looking to where I was standing. "There's nothing to it, but you're right. Why didn't you stay in the ocean?"</p> <p>"I couldn't," I repeated. "I'm sure that the colony ships wouldn't survive."</p> <p>"I'm sure."</p> <p>The captain shook his head. "So... why don't we go back to the station and get this matter into our private hands?" he asked.</p> <p></p> <p>"If that's for an invitation," he is," I promised..." I assured him.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"But, then he couldn't you'll probably be wise to keep moving back to do, but not," I might be wise to do—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
