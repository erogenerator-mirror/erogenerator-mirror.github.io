It was only one phase of the multitudinous emotions which had assailed her. There was with her an overwhelming feeling</strong> of love and trust like she didn't just want to be with him. To feel everything that he gave her. The same feeling where she wanted that he came from. She felt him in her belly, filling her and filling her up. That, and the feel of his semen coating her walls like a layer of moisturiser.</p> <p>Edna didn't even notice that her first year in college was approaching. She had come from a small town where everyone was so nice. So polite and sweet to her and she didn't mind. There had been some drama in that first year. She had never known boys who liked to be around her.</p> <p>Then something happened. A sudden, undeniable rush that took her breath and left her heart stopping. It's like he's not there in the first minute. Like he's gone all day, just the thought of being with Edna is enough to make her shudder.</p> <p>She looked up and saw Edna leaning against the wall of the dorms. The boy who was sleeping over there was smiling in the dark. She leaned back and looked again, as Edna watched her. She started to get up, but Edna just put her hands on her hair and put her face against the wall. Her eyes were shut so tightly she could smell his scent.</p> <p>She sighed deeply, before she opened her eyes and looked up again.</p> <p>"Hey, you. I'm glad you're back."</p> <p>Edna moved. She looked down and saw that Edna's head was down against her breast. Her eyes looked at the hard outline of her neck as she whispered,</p> <p>"I'm glad you're back Edna. I've missed you."</p> <p>Edna held her hair just below the collar of her long t-shirt. She gently rubbed her cheek against the hardening nub of her nipple.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful." She looked up again. Edna had closed her eyes. This time he had his head between her shoulder blades, his lips touching her lips, her nipples.</p> <p>The kisses that went on for a moment became passionate. Then Edna looked down and reached up and pushed the strap of Edna's uniform down. Edna moaned quietly when she felt the warm fingers of Edna's hands slide against her skin.</p> <p>Edna moved in and grabbed Edna's waist. She rolled her hips, and then pulled the younger woman onto her. Edna slid down on top of her. She was still wearing her skirt and socks. Her mouth went for her face, her mouth took the time to kiss and nibble.</p> <p>It began with only his mouth. He kissed her lips and then her neck. It was a slow slide that ended with his arms wrapped around Edna. The taste of her skin, the feel of her breast inside his mouth. It was almost too much.</p> <p>Edna raised her leg and wrapped it around Edna's waist. She couldn't believe how close together they were. It was almost like their kisses were one. Edna's head was resting against her neck. Edna's pussy was rubbing against her leg. Edna's hand went between two of her breasts. Edna moaned again when her fingers curled around. She began to circle her nipple, and found her nipple was hard as steel.</p> <p>Edna moved the other hand and began to rub the erect nipple between her thumb and her forefinger. Her finger moved it through Edna's softness. Edna was moaning softly but she was definitely not used to doing this to someone. Edna had been kissing Edna before tonight. She stopped to kiss her throat. Her tongue moved over Edna's skin and she felt her pussy become wet again. Her other hand was moving gently against her breast. She didn't want Edna to stop. It felt so good.</p> <p>Edna continued her movements, her hands still on her breasts touching each other as she moved her mouth over Edna's. Edna moaned deeply and kissed her deeper. She lifted her hands up to Edna's head. She pushed her tongue between Edna's lips and she kissed her. She was about to pull away, but Edna moved her mouth back onto her. Both started to feel their bodies connect, her thigh rubbed against his, her stomach in his lap. They came up to their knees. Edna sat up, and they both kissed again. Their kisses were passionate, not shy and demanding. They both were breathing hard.</p> <p>"Edna, let's get back."</p> <p>Edna smiled with her eyes closed and her hand covering Edna's face. Their kiss became longer, and their bodies touched. Edna bodies became one. Their breath met as a sensual. Their love. They both feeling. The one being one. Edin and one person one each. .
