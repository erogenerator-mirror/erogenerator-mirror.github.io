He's known for it a long time. It's always been very good. Whenever I read that particular poem my mind would get instantly aroused.</p> <p>So we get into the good stuff. I love watching him work. Sometimes I wonder if there's any romantic element in it. In truth, the most romantic things he does are when he makes love to some lucky girl, or her little clitty gets hard while he's fucking her. But not tonight. Tonight, he's going to put all his focus on her, all the way down to the nub of her clit.</p> <p>I'm sure he knows that. When I was a teenager and I read his poetry, I would masturbate furiously to his poetry. The only time I went that far was when I was young. I didn't know what to do with myself. I think it was all hormones. He'd be fucking her while I watched. And he'd probably come while he read it. It would be an experience so special and exciting that it wouldn't be long before I'd have an orgasm.</p> <p>That's my line, and my mother's line.</p> <p>He's done himself a big deal for me. He's gotten away from us.</p> <p>In between the first words coming from his mouth, his body and his words, his cock starts to move and twitch.</p> <p>And it happens. It's the first time I've seen him in action. Like, he's got that long cock waving back in front of him, ready to strike.</p> <p>He leans down and grabs the tip of my dick. He grips it like you do to your child. And just as it's about to go to his throat, his lips close over the tip and he sucks and pulls it toward his mouth.</p> <p>"Mm-mm," he says with his mouth open as he works. He's going to have so much fun with it.</p> <p>I can't concentrate on what's happening in my head. My hand is flying back and forth in the air, but never has I masturbated like this before.</p> <p>His finger tips lightly squeeze my flesh. It's hot and hard, and I can't get enough of it. My hips are rising and falling in slow motion. I'm so turned on, I think it might be time to cum.</p> <p>My breath is coming in ragged breaths. I'm holding it, but I can't hold back. I start to come. I can't take the pressure from his finger wrapped around my cock anymore. I start to convulse and spasm.</p> <p>And I'm still coming. All right, I can manage it. I can't even make myself stop to get myself off. My semen shoots straight up my shaft to hit my mother's tits, and he follows me, too, squeezing the tip of my cock and milking out the rest of my orgasm.</p> <p>When I'm done cumming, he releases my cock. He's got his finger again in my anus and his tongue right in my pussy. I'm just holding myself off the bed to do better. I don't want to move in case my parents come, so I hold still. But he holds my cock, and works his tongue out to get more saliva on his hand and my sensitive head, and slides his finger and thumb into my ass again.</p> <p>The whole time my come is coming, and as soon as I've calmed down a little, he slides his finger back in. I start to feel something else going on. His head is down against my leg and my mother's face is next to my cock. She's just smiling at me like a parent is grinning after her daughter's birthday.</p> <p>It's very weird. But it gets better with my brain. Maybe it's the alcohol. Maybe it's the taste. Maybe it's the fact that I'm finally getting my first fuck. But I can't help it. And it's so good to feel my own ass being so stimulated.</p> <p>It's like the biggest rush. That first penetration of a man's cock. The whole time he's holding my cock up against my belly with his other hand, just pulling it back and forth as it jumps out when his other hand gets into the mix.</p> <p>That first penetration made me even more eager for him.</p> <p>I love it.</p> <p>And in his eyes when his tongue is at me like that, I know I've done right. I love it.</p> <p>I'm still coming—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
