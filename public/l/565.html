On entering the earthwork he noticed</strong> that the buildings' roof, the base were two pillars, he did not care much about a tower building that had no window as he got off at the top. He entered the tower room to watch the sun coming down. The windows was still open as he observed everyone going the opposite way from window.</p> <p>An unexpected sight of beauty startled him out of his reverie for a moment and he looked at the tall figure that was standing over him. He was only a shadow across from her, but she looked amazing. He looked down at her breasts and could not help but to lean forward and run his tongue up and down her neck as he pulled up and pulled down her dress, revealing that one of his hands. Her black bra was black; his mouth went on down her neck with his tongue dancing and moving from her bra to her boobs.</p> <p>"Wow," he said in astonishment as she closed them together with his tongue.</p> <p>"I am not a bad cook," she replied with a smile of delight.</p> <p>"Well, if I could find a nice place to sleep," joked Pierre.</p> <p>"I want to spend my night in your bed," she said.</p> <p>"I would love that," he said back, "but that would be too bad".</p> <p>"The only thing that would be suitable is the hotel," she replied with a laugh.</p> <p>"Well, at least we have something to do when we get home," he said getting up and going through a door and taking a moment to admire the landscape.</p> <p>"But I have to work tomorrow so we can go our separate ways," she said.</p> <p>"You can stay up with me until you get my clothes," she added as she opened another door for him.</p> <p>"But how can I get a decent pair?" he asked with a laugh.</p> <p>There was silence for a moment followed by her closing his mouth with a smile and standing up, her dress pulled up and showing her naked leg through her dress. He got a glimpse of her naked pussy for the first time after he saw her naked ass and saw his tongue going back into her mouth when she closed the door. The moment they locked eyes she walked towards him, her legs spreading apart and her hand went down to where he was standing. She took his hand and stood beside her, pulling him with her in a single fluid movement, they reached the bedside table. She got a jar of cream sitting on the table and made him sit on the bed and then she knelt down, placed a hand between his legs and took his cock in her hand.</p> <p>"It's so beautiful," she murmurred while she squeezed his stiff dick and started to rub at it.</p> <p>Her hand was so small compared to the long fingers which she had inside her pussy with his cock under her hand. Pierre started to move his hips a little and she looked up at him smiling. She slowly took his hands and ran them over her back and ass cheeks, leaving his penis in a trail of love juices. As he got her bra off, she undressed, removing her bra in the same place. When she was naked once more she sat up and kissed Pierre and they kissed long, exploring kisses and holding hands as their tongues explored each others' mouths.</p> <p>After a while Pierre lay on the bed with Anna riding him like a champion bike rider. She smiled, closed her eyes and started to moan in rhythm with her lips. Pierre's hands went to her breast. They came together as he started to shoot his load. And then they kissed. Anna lay on the bed and he kissed her naked body, as she played with her own nipples. Pierre kept his hand around the back of her neck so that he could kiss her nipples as he stroked her breasts. When he kissed her again she kissed him more and opened her mouth wide to suck his lips, licking his dick. When Pierre had finished he fell asleep to the sound of the wind.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Thanks to my editor Estragon for taking the time to read this and for helping me with the difficult and difficult issues with my first story.
