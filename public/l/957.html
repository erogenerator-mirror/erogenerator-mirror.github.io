Her ailing brain comprehended nothing, but the only thing which she did</strong> remember was having sex with him.</p> <p>"What the hell has happened to everyone around us?" she thought. "What's been going on with everyone?"</p> <p>She was just a mere girl, after all. Her father was a doctor of medicine making, the man whom she had always believed so strongly, the man who had tried so hard to help her from the man she thought, who she thought never would see her as a friend and maybe the man he had once wanted. Then she woke up, the happiest day of her life: a happy woman.</p> <p>"No, Javert. We mustn't, now." She lifted a glass from a dish in the middle of the hotel room. "What is wrong with us? Is this how you feel?"</p> <p>"No. Look, it's too late. We should be leaving now, and we don't like this idea about having sex with other people."</p> <p>"I don't think I can do this with anyone else." Her eyes pleaded with him, even though he would not agree to it. "I don't want to do this, and I don't want to see you and me together. I can't even have sex alone anymore, just with us," she said, feeling tears threatening to fall, "just with us!"</p> <p>"But we're not together," he said, trying not to lose any hope. "We've had a little too much to drink."</p> <p>"We've had a little too much," she repeated. "Just you and me!"</p> <p>"No," he repeated. "Not with us! It feels wrong."</p> <p>Her eyes filled with fear and sadness, but at the same time, she knew she too was in danger. There was no telling whether it would be okay.</p> <p>"Okay," she said, smiling, "but it can't end that now."</p> <p>She took his hand and made him go to the chair and sat down, pulling open his dress and exposing his body. They kissed, the man who was her boss in everything from office to hospital. Her body was aching with need at the thought of her man, and Javert's hand was all over, cupping her breast, fingering her, caressing her, feeling her smooth body, and his hard penis which had been in her mouth so long ago, and she was so wet at the sight of it. Her need grew. Her hands roamed all over his body, from his neck down to his ass. His hand wandered further and further down her back to her pussy and she opened them, inviting him in.</p> <p>Her head lowered to his. For a long time. They kissed, and he slowly started to run his tongue around her lips, moving inside in a circular motion and she became more and more helpless as her body responded. She felt him pushing his hardness against her, felt him pulling her closer. Her heart was beating faster and faster as his tongue circled her lips, and she felt his manhood starting to come closer and closer to her wet pussy, until finally, without warning, the man's penis sank in her sopping wet pussy, and she came immediately.</p> <p>Javert tried to be quiet. She was an actress, a professional, and his wife had to be careful in what she did, but he was helpless against it, and he could not bring himself to let anything other than her pleasure be his last gift to her. He heard her sighing and then he felt the familiar feeling in his cock of it's climax and he came too, feeling it swell in her, and he felt the warmth of his semen in the inside of her body. Then Javert realized that her dream had become a nightmare; that there was nothing she had liked more.</p> <p>"Oh my god," said Javert, shaking his head. "You have to go!"</p> <p>"No," she said, but there was now sadness in her voice. "It was too much. I was too drunk."</p> <p>"But we made love," he protested. She didn't reply.</p> <p>"But you still want me so much," she said.</p> <p>"No. I don't want to," he said, "but there is another man here who wants to make love to you and it might cause problems for you and the marriage. We can only hope that someone will come."</p> <p>"Why?" she asked.</p> <p>"Because if there were other men around you, he would be the one. And he will be the one."</p> <p>"So," she said, "he doesn't feel as helpless as the others do?"</p> <p>"Why not? If someone likes you enough, why would all women want you?" He didn't know what to answer her. he wanted to take up the answer. that question but didn't lie to ask or hope. what..</p> <p>. I love her back. she should stay, he—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
