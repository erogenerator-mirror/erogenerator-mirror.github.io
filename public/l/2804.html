(Psal. 96. 1). And again, "God is King though the Nations be angry; and he that sitteth on the Cherubins,</strong> let the Earth rejoice..." (Psal. 92. 3).</p> <p>I wanted to fuck a god and let his life lead him through the stars. "God has king; not a god." (Geselle, "Pray for wisdom" (Ch. 10, 8). I wanted to fuck the king, and let the earth rejoice. "God has king..." (Geselle, "Pray for wisdom...", "No one's king, or God is king, until he brings forth a god" (Geselle, "Pray for wisdom."). I also wanted to fuck the king, and let the Earth rejoice..." Let the earth be jealous, and rejoice..."</p> <p>So I said, "Let the Earth rejoice to God, and let the Earth be jealous of God..." I told the king and he could fuck me. I told him to kiss me, I wanted him to see my penis in its erect state. He went to his knees and kissed my penis in reverence...it's not hard it's not hard."</p> <p>I took that as a cue to fuck the king and kissed him, letting the Earth know its approval. "He has king...if God would let me."</p> <p>I fucked the king, all the while kissing his mouth, tongue and chin, which also had a tongue-stud and a tongue stud. I felt a hand on my neck. It was the god of love that took the man first--the lust.</p> <p>When I pulled on the king I held it up, and he let go of it. And I put it straight down, and let the king take it in its hand all the way down; I was now in heaven and the King was in heaven.</p> <p>When I had got the king fully hard I sat on it, and let the king push all the way in.</p> <p>"It's so big, like a long, fat horse," the god was saying as I started fucking the king. When I got the king in my hand I let the king do as he pleased--and my balls were ready to shoot their loads all over him. I let the king do every thing but fuck and fuck.</p> <p>I kissed the king again, and let the king suck and kiss me. We both came at the same time. This time we were as loud and horny as we ever been. The king loved kissing me. It was too weird being kissed by a guy.</p> <p>When we had done our business one more time I said, "My little penis of yours is hard again," and kissed the king. "May the Earth bless our King...his kingdom..."</p> <p>As the king was leaving the office he could feel his balls about to blast his seed into that guy's vagina. "We'll talk at the office," thought the guy who had not comeâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
