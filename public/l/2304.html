I turned off the lights in my cabin and took off my glasses to go back out to my boat that I had set up as a night camp. I started stripping down as the boat was still a few miles away and soon I was shedding my clothes to find myself in the light of a full moon. I was soon laying out naked in the moonlight, my penis standing at full mast, and a big dark bush hiding it. My pole was rock hard and aching, I stroked it a bit and I decided to give myself the best blowjob of my young life....and before anyone else in the cabin could see I had it wet as a sponge and begging for more. I then dove in to be eaten out to complete the blowjob.</p> <p>I was in no hurry, I had more than enough time to work my cock as I was giving head to a very beautiful 18 year old girl. I worked my way up to her neck, licking and sucking at her skin, when I came off of her chest, I looked up to see that she had pulled her robe on and was laying on her back on a blanket. "Ohh, good you're here" she said as she lay there looking at me.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm glad to finally meet you, my name is Jay, I didn't think even you knew me". I then kissed her on the lips, kissing with lots of tongue. "What would you like to do when we get married?" She asked as I began eating her pussy. I then got up and walked over to her, and she grabbed me and began kissing me, she broke the kiss and said "You have an average penis, well not too much in the sense of penis I mean".</p> <p>I said "Oh yeah, I think you've got some really neat hands" She smiled at me and said "So when we get married we're going to have sex". I looked at her and pulled her to me so we were eye to eye.</p> <p>I then said "Well, if you ever change your mind, you have to do it tonight after dark". And said "Oh I love that night too, you will always have the best memories of waking up next to me". And then we kissed, we then moved to the bedroom and I laid down next to her on the bed, as she moved over to the head of the bed I began kissing down her neck, I could tell that her hand had moved to my cock as I laid her down. She then began stroking me and then I put the head in her mouth. I was feeling really good between her lips, she slowly worked her tongue in ways that made my shaft stiffen up and it was all I could do to keep from getting another blowjob. I began sucking very gently on her nipples as she began licking my shaft and her lips. I could feel her wetness on my fingers as I felt her hand stroking me up and down. I then lowered my hips and plunged my cock into her pussy. Our eyes were closed and we started kissing and slowly moving our hips. She was moving her hips towards me and grinding on me. I was fucking her sopping wet pussy, I could feel my cock pressing against her pussy walls, making her move more and more, she was moaning in pleasure, "Oh please keep fucking me, fuck me harder".</p> <p>I was now sliding in and out of her, my cock was wetter than I ever remember it being, and I was fucking her hard and fast. She was moaning, "I'm getting closer, I love how big and hard you are", as we fucked faster and faster. "I'm going to cum", I said. "I'm close, I'm going to fuck you till you beg me to stop". "Yes...NOW!", I yelled at her. I then pulled out and shot my cum all over her tits, then moved over her legs and then on top of her body. "Are you ok, honey?" I managed to hear in her muffled voice. "Yeah...I'm fine, it was just...."</p> <p>As my body was still laying beside hers, she reached out and started to caress my cock. "What is your name"? I asked with a question in my voice as I looked at her. My answer was muffled as she continued to stroke the shaft. "Is it still like that?", she asked with a smile.</p> <p>"Yeah I guess, I don't know if I ever liked how good you were at sucking, I never would have thought you could do that".</p> <p>"I really enjoyed doing it" she said. "But there is something else", she smiled. "Would you mind sharing a piece of me with you while I have an I get dressed to?" I have fun"?</p> <p>"Sure, let me do that too, and then"</p> <p></p> <p>and lay and layed and began getting a little do asâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
