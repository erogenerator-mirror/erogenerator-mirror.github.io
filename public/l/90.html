The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill</h4><p><strong>It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself ‘The</strong> Rabbit'’!</p> <p>She looked up into the face. It was indeed a green-skinned cock. That was where she thought it was, too, and what she'd thought was her own face, however, turned from a green-skinned one in favour of a blue one and her own, and it turned from one to another, from one white cock to another. There was no part of this that she couldn't see.</p> <p>She felt the hand take the handle of her own hand, and the cock-head pushed against her cunt. There was no more foreplay or finesse to its thrust, just the cock-head pushing against her cunt lips, and pressing firmly against her cunt hole.</p> <p>“It’s going in!” she cried. “I can’t, you can’t, you can’t. Don’t push it any more!”</p> <p>“Just push it in,” he muttered. “It likes it!”</p> <p>“Not in me!” she told him emphatically.</p> <p>He took hold of her hips, and thrust forwards, plunging his cock into her. But that wasn’t what he wanted. He wanted the real thing! It wasn’t even going to fit!</p> <p>“Wait a sec for me to adjust,” he said, and he pulled it out again. “It likes it! I can’t! I can’t!”</p> <p>“Move it back in for it,” she told him. “I’m not doing anything, even if it likes me!”</p> <p>“Then fuck me!” he said.</p> <p>“What!”</p> <p>But she didn’t.”</p> <p>“Fuck me!” she yelled again.</p> <p>“What?”</p> <p>“Fuck me!”</p> <p>Again he didn’t wait for her invitation to enter. This time he reached back, and, without any urging, he held himself up from her.</p> <p>She felt him withdraw, and she saw a look of astonishment cross his face. “There’s no way! I’ve never done it,” he told her, and, again thrust himself into her.</p> <p>In the first time she’d felt him taking her, it had been so sudden, so unexpected, so sudden that her whole body went rigid and she cried out sharply at the sudden loss of the cock. She did manage to lift her hips slightly again – almost, but not quite, to push him back – so that instead she had to push him back to begin to fuck her.</p> <p>It was all the way in. She still cried out at the sudden intrusion into her cunt again, but there was no other kind of entry than that of his cock. And there was more of him than her other cunt was really giving! Much more! The thrusting of his cock was just frantic, even as it went in and out, in and out, in and fro, in and out, it kept going. She was, it seemed, the very embodiment of that cock of his, in full colour, in motion. And now it was just as she was trying to push herself up off the floor to meet him, not at all as he was now moving up the rest of her.</p> <p>And still they kept going. It was a real movement. It made the shaft of his cock all the more hard. The head was sticking out of her cunt, and on the first thrust, there was an awful gush of semen gushing into her, and she found that it was coming out of her cunt, and it was actually coming out of her cunt! It was coming out of she!</p> <p>And then again, and this time she felt her own hot cum spurting out of her, and she was pushing herself up to meet him, again and again he entered her. And again, and she just pushed herself up to meet him, as she was, and they continued to thrust themselves into her. And when it was not her own sexual tension which was coming out, it was more that it was coming out of her cunt, just as it was coming out of her. The fucking was, as it always had been, wild, passionate, and she knew it would last, if it ever did, forever. And he kept on. And, as she thrust her own tongue into his mouth, he pressed his cock into her even more firmly, and it was at last her cunt, cunt, cunt which was now so, in addition of the cock and, of course the fucking, that she was, which was thrusting up and almost the hard on the cock of the cock of the man. The God! It was fucking.
