"I am so glad I have found you, Dorian," he said gravely. "I called last</strong> night to let you know. I know you're not alone, but you are a little early, aren't you? We'll have someone to go to if you want."</p> <p>"You've already fucked both me and Dr. Deverance, right?" He smiled. "Why don't you go and make yourself at home for a while, and then maybe you can tell me your secrets. Just say the word, and we'll see," he added playfully, before he left the room.</p> <p>Once Dorian went out to grab Dr. Deverance, he stopped him as he approached. "I thought I knew you."</p> <p>He put his hands on Dorian's shoulders, leaned down to whisper in his ear, "You know that you're not that interesting. And I'm very horny. You're a very attractive woman. Have you ever wondered what it would be like to lick someone's face, while they're doing it to you?"</p> <p>Dorian was wearing a pair of slacks and a white button up sweater sweater so large that it hugged his shapely torso and exposed the tops of his firm, tittled, and lightly tawny breasts. Under the sweater, he wore a lacy white bra, the material clinging to his full, round buttocks and outlining the shape of his cock.</p> <p>"Yes, I have, but not now," he said. "I'm not even sure that it's that interesting to know, but I do still have to do something with my hands. This is really exciting." Dorian turned to find Dr. Deverance leaning against a desk with his hands on his thighs for a moment, then began unbuttoning his shirt.</p> <p>"Yes," he replied, "I'm here to do that."</p> <p>He had Dorian take his hands off his thighs. "Now, turn about is only fair. I believe now would be a good time to talk," he told him lightly teasingly.</p> <p>Dorian felt a thrill of excitement as he turned, then took the shirt off and lay it on a chair. He pulled down Dorian's undershirt exposing his strong neck and face, then slowly began removing the clothing with his eyes and with his hands, carefully, teasingly. He leaned his head down towards the man's chest and moved his lips towards each nipple in turn. Then slowly, gently, he licked each nipple with a broad tongue ring, feeling the skin swell with excitement.</p> <p>As Dorian's lips and mouth reached the nipples themselves, he continued stroking and sucking them both into their entirety and letting them slowly, lightly, erotically, rise into his face and mouth, while his tongue did delicious things to each in turn. His right hand moved downward between his thighs and slipped inside his underwear to join with his thumb, fingers and middle finger, the two fingers in Dorian's hand. Dorian's hand rose and fell as he stroked him.</p> <p>Dorian took two fistfuls of the shirt, rolled it off his head and then began unfastening those lovely, sexy pants himself. When the pants reached his ankles, he pushed them away from his hips and off. Next came the shirt and the underwear, both together, together.</p> <p>Dorian was now naked. He had come into the room with Dr. Deverance. He had seen Dr. Deverance in a full length mirror when Dorian entered the house. He wasn't sure how far Dorian would take the revelation of the three-way with her and Dr. Deverance, but knew that it had to be soon or risk getting caught and ruined. However, he knew that he would have to make the two of them happy.</p> <p>He felt Dorian's hand slip down his belly to caress his cock and balls. He turned Dorian toward him a little so that both of them could kiss the other. Dorian placed his hand at Dorian's ass under the sweater, his fingers sliding over the denim covered ass, but not touching his cock. He knew that Dorian's cock would be getting hard in a moment, but he also knew that his cock could not be, could not be, hard or even that it would ever get hard... He had to control himself.</p> <p>Dorian's finger moved down Dorian's torso, but he left it there. As he lowered the shirt and bra, Dorian's finger again slid over Dorian's ass, finding himself already getting a bit aroused. When the bra was off, he moved his fingers down Dorian's body, over his cock, between Dorian's legs, then down into the hairless pubic area, down over his balls, and down again, deep on top of them, under Dorian them into Dorian them, back where both. He touched their cock and sucked and squeezed them, both balls, and both nipples into his hands. He sucked and both, with the two hands, in hisâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
