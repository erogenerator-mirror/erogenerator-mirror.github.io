I look forward to hearing from you as ever. Please take this story in the spirit that makes it even better, and the story you are writing can be read together as one, at the same time!</p> <p>*</p> <p>Chapter two: The next step of an exciting journey</p> <p>Chapter one: the next step in the path to my quest, to achieve the goal I've set for myself</p> <p>The world's second greatest achievement, one I have had since the dawn of civilisation, the following week had been one of the best days of my life. I had met three of my neighbours, as friends of friends, before I had taken on these three. I had spent many hours in the sun, listening to the sound of the birds and listening, and finally making love in a special way, to my heart's content.</p> <p>My life began with a new friend - a friend who had become my first sexual partner in less than 24 hours.</p> <p>I had met them on a holiday to Paris. I had made love, had sex, and had fun, but I was more than just a sexual partner to them. I was just there for the experience. We'd both gone for a drink in the French Quarter. We had started by having sex with a French waiter; now we were having sex on the table, at the restaurant, and at home, in our bedroom. I had spent many an evening getting ready for my date with David.</p> <p>The following week, I had spent my second week at the cinema, a fortnight of cinema watching, and spending the next weeks learning about each other. They had told me to strip, to play with myself, to take off my dress, my underwear, my bra, my garter belt, my stockings. They had told me to take off my clothes, and I had. I had tried to play with my nipples, which were already standing to attention. But I couldn't.</p> <p>I had never gone with a girl. I had never even had a threesome. But then I had spent many nights in bed with another girl, kissing her, kissing up and down her body, exploring her erogenous zones, finding her clitoris, finding another new area of her body I liked to explore. I had been happy until I felt what it was like for her to be on top of me, her body thrusting, her muscles tense, holding, feeling her body quivering. I had loved every second of it, of her body trembling and melding in joy. I had climaxed at the same moment she had, just a little after all of those years apart. I must have fallen asleep after the orgasm that had been so delightfully satisfying.</p> <p>Chapter 2: An exciting story I must tell, an interesting adventure to follow.</p> <p>Chapter 3: The next step in my journey in exploring the world of sexual behaviour.</p> <p>Chapter 4: One step I will find I must take.</p> <p>Chapter 3: The next step in discovering I must explore what is between my legs.</p> <p>Chapter 4: Two weeks of a month of discovering I must become a sexual creature!</p> <p>Chapter 4: One step in finding myself an older woman.</p> <p>Chapter 5: Two weeks of a month of enjoying each other's company.</p> <p>Chapter 6: Both of them a sexual creature.</p> <p>Chapter 7: Three weeks of learning the truth about the nature of the world, and a new world that is not only free but free at the same time. Chapter 8: And finally two weeks of exploration!</p> <p>Chapter 9: A journey of discovery made, and new experiences discovered.</p> <p>Chapter 10: And finally an adventure that will make me believe what I am feeling.</p> <p>Chapter 11: One step of learning that women, and men, have different forms of communication.</p> <p>Chapter 12: One step of learning that women may be different from men.</p> <p>Chapter 13: One step of learning that women may be different from men.</p> <p>Chapter 14: Together in the light of night!</p> <p>Chapter 15: Learning that each of us are differently born.</p> <p>Chapter 16: What would she feel like?</p> <p>Chapter 17: One step to join the fun.</p> <p>Chapter 18: One step to find out for ourselves both our desires, desires, needs, feelings, and attitudes.</p> <p>Chapter 19: A new step to explore!</p> <p>Chapter 20: One step!</p> <p>Chapter 21: Two steps of exploration!</p> <p>Chapter 22: Two steps exploring!</p> <p>Chapter 23: Two steps of exploration.</p> <p></p> <p><|end</p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 24: An adventure!<|end<|end<|end|end|end|></p> <p><|end.</p> <p><|<|end<|end—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
