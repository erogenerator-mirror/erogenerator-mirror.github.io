As long as the foot doth that which belongeth unto it to do, and</h4><p><strong>the hand that which belongs unto it, their labour, whatsoever it be, is not unnatural. So a man as long as he doth that which is proper unto a man,</strong> and to him, even unto her as man or as man, or anything else that can be used in an occasion such as that which be be hath never been. And thus, my dear man, as I will be, in my eyes to you, an honourable man, an honourable gentleman, to whom I stand by, I am an honourable lady, a lady who will be the only lord of mine own land; and so be it. I, in the same and thus, and thus not just, doth so honourable man nor man, and so be it. I doth not give that which you doth give to me freely; and that my heart hath not taken you away in this matter yet; but if such honourable man as I be hath hath a love for you to care not, in which I may do so, in my heart of hearts doth be the love that you so desired.</p> <p>And such is my honourable man which doth be such a kind as such a lady as I be.</p> <p>*</p> <p>I stand before you for the longest time, looking you in the eyes, in your eyes. I feel a longing to kiss you, upon seeing and feeling your lips so as yet hidden, and I find myself doing that very thing. You are so soft and yet so sweet and you have been there by my side in those moments which I so adore. So as I look upon you, I feel that my kisses of those lips, and upon feeling a longing for that, I give to you so much. I so adore that you hold me so sweetly after such a long and wonderful time; and I so adore that your hand I doth carry in mine, doth doth stroke me and feel your desire so as yet unseen. Ah, you are an excellent kisser, you know. I so adore you. But now. I so adore you, also.</p> <p>I have kissed you so many times. It is as if some small part of my being is giving me the kiss of many others. And so many others I have felt, on those last kisses, before my departure, since my stay in Venice. The first kiss. Oh, I just know. It was a kiss, my last kiss, to kiss you. It was indeed a real kiss.</p> <p>My head leans back against you, and I have just stood there upon the grass of your garden, a grass planted there in a most natural way. Here in the dark of the night I had never before, nor ever would have looked upon a beautiful, most beautiful, and sometimes lovely, flower with such a flower. As I stood there upon the grass, as I was, and as you, I still stood upon that grass, you have taken my gaze from all else aside from your lovely eyes which I so adored for ever before. I stood on the grass in the very spot where you stood upon that flower with such a plant, and even as I stood there upon those flowers that you always stood upon upon the grass, I was in the presence of you.</p> <p>My heart so beamed because, as I stood there upon the grass, upon that grass. And upon that grass you stood upon, on the grass, as I stood upon that grass, as I stood upon that flower, as I stood upon that plant.</p> <p>I stand there upon that grass, and upon that green garden, in front of such a beautiful, most beautiful flower which I so adored. I feel so good upon standing there upon your garden with you upon the grass, as you always stood there upon that grass in front of such a beautiful flower. I feel so, so good upon standing there upon that grass. I love you so much.</p> <p>I know that there is love in your eyes. You know that there is affection there for me. I know that you're a good kisser as well. And you know that well. And you've felt the same love for me as I felt for you. You know that, and perhaps more than one, there is more inside of our hearts which are, and more, passion than either of us. There is love more than anything which we'd ever felt.</p> <p>As I stand there upon that grass in front of your garden, I stand right there upon that grass with you. For there is even more of the very love and passion the two of us feel upon the soil and the place where we stand upon it. I stand there upon that grass upon which we stand upon each other.</p> <p>I've come to you thus. I've come to your garden. I've come to your love. I've come to your heart.</p> <p>I've said these things. I've said them. as in the same words. my last night in this second evening ., but no other moment the words.-in-in which you., or the words which I've said, that night are given me. which Iâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
