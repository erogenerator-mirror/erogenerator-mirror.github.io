The reader knows. Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean had arranged things so that he could exist there, and he could almost breathe. It is a strange</strong>, but wonderful thing, but when you've had a while to wait until a very long time to make love again you simply can't let go of those feelings. He was in the back of a coffin, naked, wearing his coffin jacket that he had been given by the Count (that was his name, remember), he was wearing a coffin mask, and it was obvious that he was in the coffin right now, and his coffin mask said he was naked. But he would die if he didn't continue to enjoy himself.</p> <p>It's been years since I've had any man that I've made love with, with a condom, with no cum. I've already tried sex with my fiance. Only a couple of times. I had to pull out. I had to pull out. He came out of the coffin and I didn't know exactly what happened in this world. I had never felt a wave of pleasure or an intense, overwhelming orgasm before. My lover's cum was everywhere, on his face, in his hair, on his chest and arms, even in his mouth and all inside his mouth. He had to have gotten off. And in a few seconds his cum was in my pussy, and I was sucking it off him.</p> <p>"Jean Valjean, get me a condom," he said, so I had to get dressed.</p> <p>So we both did. We sat on the sofa, next to each other, and began our journey to a new place, to a new time. It was dark, but we didn't care; we were in each other's arms; we kissed deeply, deeply, so passionately, so lovingly. And we were on the rug on the rug so happily, lovingly, so contentedly and blissfully, with our arms intertwined, our kisses all over, our hands caressing each other, and my lover's cum inside my pussy, where our lover hadn't been. We kissed and kissed and kissed and kissed.</p> <p>I could feel the pressure building to an unbelievable climax. I pushed his face away from my breast, which I would have loved to suck. "Make love to me," I told him. I held his face against my breast, but that wasn't necessary. He put one arm over my waist and the other in my crotch, and slowly began to fuck me and I was moaning and writhing with pleasure and desire, begging him to come inside me. Then I felt his hot cum begin to fill the condom. Then I felt his tongue in my pussy as he came. His tongue was so expert, to be such a sweet and delicious lover. But I had to be careful. I couldn't let him go, couldn't give him a moment to breathe from now on. I wanted to suck all of his cum into me, into my pussy. As he tasted his juices, as he pulled out and his cum ran out of me, I moved my hips back against your mouth and I could feel my climax building again, faster, harder.</p> <p>The condom was already filled, but you gave it to me so that I could feel you. And I knew that when I was completely filled with your cum, when you had removed the condom, you would be able to make me cum again. I could almost feel your orgasm in my pussy again, even as you came. And I could see your whole body shake. I could almost feel the intensity of yours, your lovemaking with your ex-husband. My lover's cum, his cum, inside me, all inside my pussy, I can feel you—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
