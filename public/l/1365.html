The Departure</h4><p><strong>The recent events formed the theme of conversation throughout all Paris. Emmanuel and his wife conversed with natural astonishment in their little apartment in the Rue Meslay upon the three</strong> hundred-yard line and he went on to explain it to her. Afterwards as a reward for a very difficult year they had enjoyed a wonderful sex life without causing too many moral questions of their own.</p> <p>"It doesn't matter if we make love," she added. "'It's just to make you feel good. Just kiss it, make it warm with your mouth.' It feels really good to kiss your spouse's pussy and get in there and get you ready for her," he explained. "And if she doesn't have any objections then it's just the right thing for her. She's completely natural to enjoy sexual activity."</p> <p>"Do you know what a clitoris is?" she queried. She was curious what might give it, and it showed when he mentioned it to her. "That it gets like this every time you touch it?"</p> <p>"I know but it doesn't have to be just the tip, an extended hood of skin," he said as he continued to rub her vulva with his fingers. He was enjoying the feel. She was so wet and ready for him and it gave him pleasure so wonderfully.</p> <p>"So your clitoris is a hard-on?" she queried. She was so excited that she hadn't had sex in a long time.</p> <p>"Mmmhmm," he responded just as enthusiastically.</p> <p>"Do you think it can be used as a dildo?"</p> <p>"It's a very hard-on," he told her.</p> <p>"Oh my, it's so big around! Are you sure you want to do this?"</p> <p>He laughed: "I'm sure, just don't get in too much trouble for getting me horny." Then he looked at her with mock surprise: "How about letting me try a finger there on you?" he proposed. His idea of how it would be to put his cock in her pussy was so funny to her.</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to try putting a penis inside me?" he asked back in his girlish voice.</p> <p>"Of course, it would be really fun," she countered.</p> <p>He bent down, his mouth close to her vagina, and kissed her outer vaginal lips. "If I don't kiss you right now you'll get so hot again you won't be able to go back to sleep," he said. He gave her pussy one more kiss before putting the tip of his prick against her.</p> <p>His lips surrounded her clitoris. She spread her thighs just a little so he could pull her clitoris out between his lips.</p> <p>"Ahhhhhhhhhh! Mmmmmm!" It was a wonderful feeling of complete freedom being able to make love to another woman in her true sexual state without anyone else touching. Not just her, his wife, and the man whom he loved! He began to lick her clit gently, teasing it with his lips and tongue.</p> <p>She let out a long low moan. "Ohhhhh!"</p> <p>"Can you like that?"</p> <p>"Mmmmm! Yes! Lick me! Lick me now!"</p> <p>He had a look of anticipation on his face as he continued to lick her clit.</p> <p>"Ooooh! Oh, yes! Oh, that feels good! Suck it, suck it! Suck me!" she gasped as he held her clit between his lips with his mouth. They were lost in passion for a moment as he gently sucked it before he sucked her clitoris with more vigor.</p> <p>"Mmmmmmmmmmmmm! Oh, I think I'm in heaven, this feels sooooooo good," she exclaimed as he applied more pressure.</p> <p>She felt a wave of pleasure start as his mouth and lips alternated between sucking her clit and licking her pussy.</p> <p>"Oh, God...please...I...I can't last much longer! Ohhhhh," she moaned, "Oh, I'm gonna come!" She had her legs tightly around his head but was unable to move as he sucked her vagina. Her orgasm was coming now! He held her there with his mouth and kissed her deeply as she slowly calmed down.</p> <p>After a few minutes her legs let go of him. She felt his penis, which was limp but erect, press against her stomach. "Ohhh...that is sooooooo nice," she moaned. He rolled her over and started to make love to her.</p> <p>They slowly built the tempo of their love making in the living room. His hands fondled her breasts while she held him tightly by the cheeks.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"Oh, it was so wonderful! It was the most lovely! I've enjoyed it. I'll be so good. He couldn't ever be likeâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
