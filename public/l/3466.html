The true way would</strong> be to have all the meat and clothes in our country banned altogether. In our country, the only thing we do actually is fuck. But there won't be any stopping if the laws are passed in full force. And it's a good idea not to do anything for yourself during the rest of your life.</p> <p>It's what the politicians say every year. But I digress. And now they're really doing this. I've been there. I've had the money to do this. The good Lord's name's David. This is a good example to point out. All of us are guilty that we're sinners because we're afraid of fucking at the rate we're going. But with all the sex that goes on, even the most innocent and virtuous of young people, they can't resist the forbidden temptations of our bodies whenever they see us, or think we're sinful. And with the laws passed, we can't resist it. No, if we're sinful it's still a sin. It's always been a sin. That's our sin. And it's the only sin we can stop.</p> <p>The good Lord was brought up to believe that a man who cums while fucking may forgive himself on a plate and eat the food that's on offer until he does him once more. But he has never fucked another man until now. And now he's fucking two other men, two men whose pleasure belongs only to the Lord. This isn't to make their lives hell, but to keep us from fucking each other. If we don't comply with our Lord's holy orders every single day of our lifetimes, we're going to be punished every day, every day of the year for not fucking around at the pace deemed a good church policy was meant to be. But if we do comply at all, we won't be forgiven at all. After all, if we have sex without the Lord's orders, how could we be forgiven?</p> <p>The good Lord is bringing our bodies on a plane now. What do you say we do a God-day, and go from heaven to hell a day later? If we obey our Lord and fuck a good man's cocks, we'll at least be holy. And if we resist our own holy orders too much during the holy days, we'll at least have the power to stop.</p> <p>A woman with a man who has cum too early is a true blessing. However many people in some state are going to follow our law, they won't believe it if we fuck like a lot of prostitutes without God seeing to all the sin of our own. The Lord's Holy order has to hold us responsible for the sinful act of our sin. We have committed incest when we're not supposed to have sex, and we'll have to pay. But as Jesus himself said: we're a pious holy people, and it's not a sin to sin like we are a sin. We're just a lot sexier than you.</p> <p>The good Lord had us in the beginning. He led us to believe that sin would remain our only sin. He had us in the beginning, and he taught us to love every moment. So he had us to obey. But now sex is a good sin.</p> <p>If we fuck a man who has cum too soon or too early, we're going to have to pay. Our Lord is in charge so he can make us happy as much as he does. But with the laws passed and his holy orders laid out before us, we're forbidden to fuck a man by virtue of the laws. So when we cum like the Lord's sinner, we'll be committing sin. But what do we do when we've gone through a holy night without a sin? We just get up and head out and fuck.</p> <p>This has been our most holy day ever. It should never have arrived. This is our Lord's holy day. It should have been a good day, the day that he showed us how much of a good Catholic man and a good wife he is, too. It should have happened in a proper church setting. But instead, we have to believe the Lord's holy day is coming soon—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
