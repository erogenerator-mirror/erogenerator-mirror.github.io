From his vantage point near the bed, I am sure the older man, his name is Martin van Bledsovin, could not have been more pleased to have an elderly woman as a substitute lover. He is much younger than his wife was, who married in 1948 rather than remain in her husband's castle and now stands as a prince in the Kingdom of Transylvania.</p> <p>When he began to kiss his wife, he asked her if they were going to marry. She said that she preferred not to answer but instead looked at him as if he was talking to royalty. It was the same question I said to Dénèle for Dèle is her daughter.</p> <p>Martin gave in and kissed his wife while thrusting his hips and pressing his pubic bone into hers. It was very erotic to me and when he stopped kissing her, looking to the side, I saw the older man had a smile on his face.</p> <p>When his wife began to suck lightly on his cock, I saw the younger man pull his wife into her sexual embrace. I am sure Martin has heard all that he wanted to hear in his life and now it is he’s having a fuck with such vigor.</p> <p>When Martin came in her mouth, I saw the happy face on her face as she looked past a boy who had his mouth full at her open mouth. I also seen the smile on her face as she pulled his cock and sucked the boy’s sperm into her mouth. It was the happiest moment in her life.</p> <p>After his climax, he turned his wife to face him and she kissed him. His mouth was covered with cum and he drank it without question. He kissed her forehead.</p> <p>“Málokov, I never knew that you had a man as a husband in your life, a husband in your life.”</p> <p>“We met at the same party, when you went to one of your parties with your wife, but, you are the first one to kiss me.”</p> <p>“Oh. You are such a considerate and sweet kisser, Martin.”</p> <p>“But, if a man is in love with a woman and he has an affair with her, he must be very, very jealous of her at his age.”</p> <p>“Oh, I’m sure he must be.” But, you know that he will always be in the way.”</p> <p>“Yes, I hope so. My love for you was great and I never felt like I should be so jealous.”</p> <p>“But, how could you expect me to have an affair with you?”</p> <p>“You must be an innocent because you are my husband.”</p> <p>“Are you serious?”</p> <p>“Do not put yourself out by telling him that I am your wife.”</p> <p>My own question seemed unnecessary. He looked over my shoulder at the couple and said, “My love.”</p> <p>He kissed her, kissed her mouth and she kissed him back. Now, Martin wants you both to be happy. And, if he comes to love both of you, he will definitely love you no matter how much he may want to screw one of you.</p> <p>They must make passionate love to each other, and they certainly would love that to be the case for my beloved Dénèle. But, he wants to have both of you together. So you must wait until you are married and you both are at your peak. This was never about sex. He could tell, and I can assure you that you will enjoy it. But, you must wait until my love is fully satisfied.”</p> <p>She kissed him again, this time his lips to her mouth. Then I saw him sucking her breath and then her lips, kissing her hard and deeply and then, her eyes, which had once gleamed into the sunset, were still locked in hers, as if a lock, which then fell down and was released again.</p> <p>To me, seeing the couple kissing each other and the love reflected on her face, is such a beautiful moment. I want my wife so badly and I don’t have anything else to do except to go back and see what I did wrong. But, before I do that, I must stop watching him and I have to prepare myself for the same, before I go back to the man.</p> <p>’m ready in case or not?</p> <p></p> <p>’go and not,’s</p> <p>either and, but don’s a—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
