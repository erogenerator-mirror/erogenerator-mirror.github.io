The Guardsmen held him up by his arms before his body crumbled to the floor.</p> <p>At the far end of the High Guard stood Emperor Napoleon and his entourage, in fact only the two were left. However, once Napoleon had gone through all the ranks of the Sergeants he held him up by his neck and kissed his hair.</p> <p>His mouth opened for Napoleon's next command, and soon the two were locked in a tight embrace. Their lips and tongues explored each other as Napoleon explored her face with his tongue. Both were clearly aroused at the prospect of more sexual fulfillment.</p> <p>"And don't think I'm not going down on you," the Emperor said quietly. "Your wife, Anna, is already quite wet."</p> <p>"Yes, I do love your cock," Anna replied. "I also love the thought of what you're going to do to me in the future," she said.</p> <p>"Anna, you're a very attractive woman."</p> <p>"Oh, yes. I've always thought so. You never knew that I loved oral sex. There you go, giving me the oral treatment like all you's been doing. Now I've got the honor for it." She turned to face the Emperor. As she did, she reached to her crotch and began caressing herself through her skirt.</p> <p>"Let me at least undress you."</p> <p>Anna unfastened Joseph's pants, then took his cock and knelt down in front of him. Joseph, at the moment being unzipped, took it into his mouth. Anna slid the zipper of his pants down and began stroking his cock.</p> <p>"Anna, I love your hand on my cock," Joseph said. "If I knew you had such an excellent hand job in addition to having a fine tongue you could be a porn star I'd do something like this often."</p> <p>"Then I'm sure I'd get loads of blowjobs," Anna agreed.</p> <p>"And I wouldn't be able to last very much longer, much less enjoy what is about to happen next," Joseph said, pulling his foreskin back. He could feel the pre-cum coating the head. Anna took his cock in her mouth and started to work over him. She cupped his balls with one hand as she sucked him. She sucked and licked his cock from tip-to-head for several minutes.</p> <p>When Joseph came in her mouth, Anna lifted her head to see how Joseph was doing. He smiled up at her. Anna opened her mouth and let the cum fly. She closed her mouth tightly and tasted just the first shot of semen. The second shot landed on her tongue. Anna closed her mouth and swallowed again just as Joseph's next jet blasted against her throat. The third and fifth blasts coated her tonsils. Joseph's head was still turning slowly in Anna's direction as he watched his semen oozing rapidly from Anna's lips and on her chin, chin, and neck. Finally, when it was over, Anna was finished cleaning Joseph's cock until it was clean.</p> <p>Anna stood up, grabbed her dress and blouse and left the room. As she walked out she handed Joseph a couple of tissues and a bottle of his own special brandy. He took them in hand and sat back on the sofa, taking a long swig from the bottle. Then he took himself a deep drink and leaned back in the chair.</p> <p>"Anna, I want to apologize for my behavior during your wedding."</p> <p>"Joseph," Anna replied. "I'll tell you about it later, then it's late and you can go home and fuck your wife. Go to bed, honey, until after the wedding."</p> <p>"OK. I understand." He sat back and took another drink from the bottle. "And I'll be sure to do a lot more of you before the wedding." He smiled at her and looked at her. "Don't worry, you're not upset with what just happened."</p> <p>Anna looked down at herself as she thought about what she could do to impress the Emperor she had no doubt had the means of acquiring the Emperor. However, she would need time to think about it and her plans for the upcoming wedding as well as with Joseph. She took another deep drag from her brandy and then got on her high horse again.</p> <p>"Anna," Joseph said, "you need to understand that I love you and you love me, don't you?"</p> <p>"Yes, I think I do."</p> <p>"Do you love me?"</p> <p>Anna stopped in shock, then looked at him and said, "Yes."</p> <p>"Do you need to make me, Anna.</p> <p></p> <p>There is a special kiss, Anna," Joseph. "A special name for love you do? She smiled Joseph?</p> <p>I love is, you love me? do now come to meâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
