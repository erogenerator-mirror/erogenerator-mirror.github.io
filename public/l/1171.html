All that they heard was confused noises, and at intervals, fusillades; but these were rare, badly sustained and distant. This respite, which</strong> was what it was, came, though the moment when it was, as he was, with much the same result. He felt nothing between his ass and his cock in any particular way, although he was definitely still inside of her as she lay there.</p> <p>Her body was warm and solid in the confines of his body. His entire being was centered on it. Her entire being was focused on him.</p> <p>Her face was pressed into the bed. Her eyes were closed. She was sleeping. But then, when in this moment, they were closed in the way only their bodies were. And it seemed all of that mattered.</p> <p>His head was somewhere else. He didn't know that and maybe that wasn't true either. Maybe it was another dream; but in the wake of this whole time, or whatever it was, it felt like this whole time, every fucking night, the few weeks before and every day since, as if this dream was the greatest and absolute greatest time of his life. That was something he had wanted to do for so long. But, all things at once, every moment of this whole time, and then his dick, with its pulsing member, inside of her, she would sleep. So, he thought, all those things were not important but in this moment, they were important.</p> <p>And with that, his mind came, and this was what he found most important. Every single moment of this night meant something. But he also knew that all of that counted against something. For the whole weekend, or so it seemed in time, it seemed that he had nothing and nothing else to hold on to, as if he and her had nothing and everyone else had nothing and nobody. In addition, to make sure they were still alive and on their way back to sanity, he had to hold onto something for as long as possible.</p> <p>And in any event, in the end, she had no clue that he came back. No memory left to share. So instead, he began to push into her. He was a quick study in how she came back to life. Her body could move to him, and he knew that she could only move. She was the first thing they had ever touched.</p> <p>And he was still inside of her. So fucking deep, he remembered; and she responded to his deep, steady thrust by tightening her body around him. She responded, but she couldn't move with him like he was fucking her. So he had to do the rest with her; and that was exactly what they were going for tonight. And besides, who would ever get bored of fucking one of them anyway? He did not have anyone else in his bed right now. That would have at least explained why she went out on Monday, even though he was not home alone until Monday. That would also explain everything about when he fucked her all weekend.</p> <p>But of course, that did not answer him. Not at this moment. She felt him deep within her. They both felt him deep within her body. Her muscles were still tightly wrapped around him when he was pushing into her, but then, it was enough. He was pushing deeper, but she couldn't move so much to get him in.</p> <p>He thrust in and out between her lips several times; each time eliciting a soft, almost imperceptible sigh from her. On the fourth thrust, he pulled out of her, and rolled her over on her back. She moaned, and that earned a nod. His mouth made a line over her right breast, a line that he had never been able to do before, and that earned a look over her shoulder. When he returned to his position, he kissed above her breast, and then, as if to remind herself, again she brought her hand to her pussy. He slid back and forth between her legs, and every time he made room for her, she felt him grow inside of her.</p> <p>Eventually, he felt that he held out for a long time. He knew what this was; that he came when she came. There was no real feeling or anything inside of him, that night or any other. But now, when he came, when he saw his mark on her breast, that was what he saw as a good night. And when she came, well, this was all right too. And for the first time ever, there was something right about it to feel him come deep inside of her. He wanted to stay there forever, until he was done fucking.</p> <p>She felt him push out into her again, and then he thrust in again. She felt her second nipple slide, and feel his hands move to a finger to her lips, and he moved first one finger back and forth, but to her face, to her lips, and then to her mouth. She felt his mouth. His lips and her vagina, both of them, his hands and both at once again. His mouth was to her—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
