Valentine</h4><p><strong>We may easily conceive where Morrel’s appointment was. On leaving Monte Cristo he walked slowly towards Villefort’s; we say slowly, for Morrel had more than half an hour to spare</strong>. She’d come in as planned with no rush. He couldn’t wait to fuck her. For the first time, Morrel didn’t look out of place standing at 5’4”, with light brown hair, large blue eyes, and a beautiful young face. Her breasts would be huge: 32DD. Her eyes were her best feature, and she knew what she wanted to do with them. He knew that from now on; he would fuck her every chance he got. This wasn’t just because of the fact that he was a virgin; his entire sexuality was on display. Sex mattered and needed to be consummated. He'd do anything she wanted; he just hoped that she was ready for it.</p> <p>Mordre moaned; his face pressed hard against hers. She put her arms around his neck; her breasts pressing against his chest. They kissed longingly. Morrel slipped his hands under her loose top and bra and felt the weight of her breasts pushing against them, and her nipples hardening under his touch. Their tongues were exploring; exploring the boundaries of each other’s mouths, delving deeper. Morrel’s fingers were caressing her bra strap, running over her nipple, while she undid his shorts. He knew as soon as he saw her beautiful face he would want her even more; he always wanted to see her naked once they were in bed. It was true...now he wanted to enjoy it, too.</p> <p>Mordre slid her bra straps off its shoulder and laid it on top of her top. He lifted her shirt over her head, and tossed it aside, along with her bra and pants. Morrel didn’t seem to care as long as she was going to get to see her gorgeous little body; that part she liked a lot. He cupped her breasts in his hands, and kneaded them gently while kissing her. Their moans and cries encouraged Morrel to continue. Her nipples were as hard as he could make them. She kissed his neck while he ran his thumbs over them; his hands would squeeze the cheeks of her ass.</p> <p>Mordre’s kisses were moving further down her neck, towards her breasts. The anticipation was killing him. He could scarcely breathe. The anticipation of having to spend so much time with her was killing him. Her breasts were large and heavy, and her nipples were so hard, he thought he might have died when he was licking them. Morrel gasped when his mouth took one nipple in; he had just barely finished it when she came, and he nearly couldn’t breathe. She tasted so good; so soft, so wet, so beautiful. Her moans were music to his ears. Morrel had never known a woman like her; his eyes couldn’t seem to focus, his mouth couldn’t even close enough to suck the sensitive pink tip into his mouth. He sucked it like he would suck her nipple; his entire body was on fire and he hoped she wouldn’t notice. He was in a hurry to be alone; he didn't want to leave. For years he’d imagined making love with her. There had been times when his dreams had been as hot as those. Now he imagined lying beside her with his mouth sucking her nipples.</p> <p>The whole situation was a surreal dream; his whole life had just been a fantasy; but with Morrel, he wanted more. She was perfect, and to have this opportunity to experience her was more than any fantasy; he wanted to make everything real. It was one of those things that happened without any hesitation. To be as close to her as possible without hurting her; while being with her was the most romantic, erotic, loving, and pleasurable experience he had ever had.</p> <p>Mordre took both her breasts in his hands and began licking all around and around her nipples. He felt her arch her back as he did so. Their tongues danced in each other’s mouths while her hands were all over his chest and back. Her moans were music to his ears; his hands, his mind, everything about this moment was music to his ears. He wanted to taste her, and he wanted to make love right now in front of everyone. He had to have her right now. He wasn’t sure how exactly his feelings with her had made them even; but he decided that they needed to get it right if he was ever going to get his wish.</p> <p>Mordre placed her hands against his chest and lifted herself slightly from the bed. He watched in wonder as his bride’s legs slowly parted, revealing her gorgeous pussy, moist, swollen, wet pussy. The sight was alluring beauty, even more beautiful sight. She began sliding her hands down his body slowly made her breasts to him every moment. She looked into submission on her eyes and he saw he could do more. He was as—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
