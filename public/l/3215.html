English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>XVI. NEIGHBOUR-LOVE.</h4><p><strong>Ye crowd around your neighbour, and have fine words for it. But I say unto you: your neighbour-love is your bad love of yourselves. Ye flee unto your neighbour from</strong> the house, you flee from the school, and now you can get a piece of you. Now let me in.</p> <p>I know that this is all just a crazy dream, but in all certainty that's exactly what we did. And it's quite clear that you're the one in control. Now lets' see what happens if I tell you, shall we?</p> <p>"A bit cold, love? May I enter your body? I can help you. It may be cold, but I can make you warm, and feel your heart beating... I will be as cold as you are warm and you'll like my body."</p> <p>"Well how could I possibly refuse," you smile up at me and gently lay your hand against my upper arm, and slowly you move my hand down to the side of my body, and your hand caresses me like a lover. Your fingers move around my belly, making me gasp and relax into you closer and closer until finally your face comes towards mine. You kiss me and press your naked hips against my body, making me moan. I feel your wet penis against me, and gently I undo your pants, and then you step away from me so that I can take off all of my clothes.</p> <p>"Let's go to the bedroom, love," you whisper in my ear, and then you turn around and lead me to the bed. I take off your shirt, and then you let me remove your pants, followed shortly by your underwear. We lie next to each other and kiss, and I move my hands across your body. You begin moving your thighs, and I touch the tip of your erect penis with my fingernails. You kiss my mouth and begin kissing my breasts, first along the edges of my areolas, and down to my stomach. I feel your lips brush across my nipple through my bra, and I feel your penis pressing against my lower stomach. I'm about to lose my virginity, and you're in control. I'm about to lose my virginity.</p> <p>But the dream ends abruptly, and you kiss your way back down to my breasts. I feel you begin to kiss my belly, and then suddenly you move your hands downward as if to push my panties down. Then you pull them down, and then as the panties drop away to join my clothes and shoes, you are between my legs now. I can feel your hardness pressing against my own. You kiss me again and move your way along my legs, kissing along my inner thigh. I want you inside me, but I'm still scared. Maybe I'm not ready for you to put a condom, or let me feel your bare penis in my body; maybe not really. But you start rubbing the tip of your penis on my clit, and I reach my hands up to hold you there. You slowly pull away from me when I'm not ready and sit down on the side of the bed, and I have to sit down beside you. We lay there for a few moments, and I'm beginning to relax. All my fears are gone, all my worries are gone, my love for you has turned back into a loving, trusting smile...</p> <p>At last, the dream has ended. But it continues on for a few more minutes, and then you begin kissing your way up my body. I can feel your warm lips touching my nipples as your lips make their way towards them. You slowly move your mouth over them, and then you give them the same treatment as before. Then you're on top of me, and our naked bodies begin to press together. You begin licking my breasts, and then your mouth starts to tease one of my nipples. You kiss me gently while you pinch the other. My hands start to caress your face and your hair. You reach down and feel my stomach, and gently tease your fingers up and down my stomach until you touch my vagina. You find it warm and wet, and you lightly trace the tip of your penis and around the lips in between them, leaving only the tip as a barrier.</p> <p>"Please touch me," I tell you with my eyes closed.</p> <p>You give me your hand and place your palm on my vulva. I feel the tip of you touch it, and I can see that you can see it as well. You then put your finger against my wet hole gently, and you begin to slide it in and out, making me moan and breathe in pleasure. Then without warning or care, you put your middle finger in your mouth, and take it from your mouth and gently put it on my tongue. Then you suck it again and continue to do me gently, while your mouth works itself between my legs. I'm so close now and I feel as if possible my vagina's going to burst. But I'm not allowed to yet to orgasm yet.</p> <p>You move your hand starts to kiss my clitoris up my breasts again, and find my vagina, and kiss it and slowly, and now kiss it as yourâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
