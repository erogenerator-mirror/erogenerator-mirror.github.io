In the mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon, gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called,</strong> "Hush! We are not that old." Mr. Rochester's wife, Mrs. Rochester, made a joke about me, and Mr. Rochester smiled and waved me off. As time went on I learned that he was engaged to one of his students. Mrs. Rochester, who had become divorced, had a boyfriend. He had been single most of his life, and while he dated girls from another town, he never seemed to want more than one girl at the time.</p> <p>For over a year I had become more interested in male sex than I had been in my male classmates. In the early years though it was all just talk, and I knew that my classmates were looking rather than being sexually charged. But it was a different thing. I found that older men were more sexually active, and when I was around older men, and even Mr. Rochester, I found myself getting excited thinking of his cock pumping its spunk down my throat or into my mouth. For the very first time I was really turned on by something other than sex.</p> <p>One day I had to go to another class to pass Mr. Rochester's class. He had a friend over, and as we had come in to his office, I saw Mr. Rochester sitting behind his desk. I got up as we approached. We stood in front of the desk, our arms around him, and stared at one another all the time. When we were almost to the professor, Mr. Rochester said, "Let's get this over with. I've got a feeling you'd enjoy spending the day with me." We had barely gotten to the front of his desk before he had pulled me behind himself and was making love to me with a passion that I could only describe as a desire to fuck. I think it was more like a frenzied sex encounter than an actual sex act. When he put his hands on my shoulders and began to push me back toward him, I realized that my head was spinning, because it was all about my lust and sexual pleasure. I was just getting over my shock and surprise that this really happened. I was still not sure whether I wanted to do it, to be with a man, or to continue what I had thought of as my college romance. It was the first time I thought of all those years ago when I had the urge to do something to him and really have him, but I had no idea what.</p> <p>I don't think I ever really realized I wanted to be with guys, particularly Mr. Rochester, until all these years later. I had always thought that the sex act was like a thing for boys, and he could do it too, but, even now, now, I had the feeling that it would take a strong man just to make the most of it. I had always had that feeling. Mr. Rochester had always loved me, and I always felt that if I wanted more, he would give it to me. He never gave a crap about me just being with men, and if I thought he was giving them something sexual, like blowjobs, I didn't say no. I did love sex, I was proud of it.</p> <p>Our first two dates, after I had gone to school, had been a lot of fun. But there seemed to be a third man there. Finally, on our second date, I was a little more open to the idea of having a third man, and I knew that if I liked him, I would really enjoy being with him. This man, I had met, had been a friend of my old classmates, and even more than a friend of my former classmates. I found that there was this feeling that I could never quite explain away, like what this was like as if it was happening for all of college kids. Whatever it was that attracted me to Mr. Rochester, it was all so natural and it was so exciting, so new, that my heart just raced and my panties turned to jell-eyed anticipation.</p> <p>It was also so much like a lovemaking session. Mr. Rochester kept us naked for two weeks. Then he had me put on a robe and come to his office where we made love all afternoon. I don't know how it happened, but as soon as we entered his office, I became an object in front of a room full of students. As soon as we entered his office, I immediately felt that this was the first time someone had really stripped me of my clothes – and my husband. I had never felt more exposed than I did that day, even in my bra and panties, when I got in Mr. Rochester's office.</p> <p>For a while, as Mr. Rochester and I talked and laughed and got good-natured, one student or other, I thought I would take a few liberties with Mr. But I don't know what goes as I didn't care, and my legs, but I never touched, or licked, and was in my breasts or sucked, I—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
