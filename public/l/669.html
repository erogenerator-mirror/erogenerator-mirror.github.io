A huge campfire was blazing brightly in the midst of the snow, lighting up the branches of trees</strong>.</p> <p>"This is the best place in the world to be a bonfire," I grinned as the first starlight began to illuminate the tree branches above us.</p> <p>"This is just like the first bonfire," she said.</p> <p>Our bodies were pressing together, her breasts pressing against me while our feet were still on the ground, her hips pressed against me. We kissed passionately, tongues fighting hotly and my cock pressing into the crack of her bare ass.</p> <p>We kissed all over the tree again, our lips smacking and our breath mingling with the sound of our bodies beating against each other. I could feel her nipples pressed against me through our clothing as we kissed, and I could also feel her hand clutching my cock while the warmth from her hand reached it.</p> <p>"I'm a bad boy," she said after our kiss broke. We both laughed at that as she began to undo my pants, which had become damp by now. She pulled my jeans all the way off, my cock springing to life and standing up straight.</p> <p>"Why don't you step outside and have a shower before we both burn up the wood?" she said, and we both laughed again. She was a perfect little nymphomaniac who enjoyed sex while she waited for another opportunity. "Come on, it's just a bonfire!" she giggled as she ran up to me and kissed me once on the cheek, then quickly grabbed my cock in her hand. "Don't forget to wash yourself, too, because I'm just getting started!"</p> <p>We spent two seconds together in the woods, exploring each others bodies with our hands and fingers. After that, we sat under the trees next to each other, soaking wet. The cool water felt almost refreshing, especially after having to share it with the naked woman with my raging cock. We kissed passionately while our bodies dried, until finally she stepped out of her clothes. She was naked to begin with, but she soon joined me in the shower.</p> <p>"I wonder how we can possibly wash each others bodies?" she asked. "This is our first day at nudism."</p> <p>"It's not a nudist camp," I said, "but it's pretty damn hot!"</p> <p>"I know," she replied, "but we'll have to go back to my place and take it easy next time. I still don't want my clothes to get in the way!"</p> <p>"Let's take it easy again," I said, and we both laughed.</p> <p>We exited the shower and got out again, but again we had to get our feet on the ground again, and again we had to get a couple feet on the ground. With a few of the clothes sticking to our feet, it was easy to pull them to our feet before we got them all the way off. She looked in front of me and caught my eyes staring in the mirror.</p> <p>"Why don't you take a shower with me then, honey?" she said, kissing my lips and making a little game of kissing them. "I want to show you a very arousing new way to love-making. I'll be standing next to you in the shower with just my breasts covered with soap until the hot water runs out, and then I'll put soap in the shower and turn the water back on. I'll be leaning against you in your arms as you hold my tits." She rubbed my throbbing cockhead up and down her bare leg, which I noticed was quickly becoming soaking wet.</p> <p>"Would you like to wash my back, honey?" she asked, and I couldn't believe this was actually going to happen.</p> <p>"You sure do!" the guy next to me, a middle-aged woman who was sitting next to me said, "I would love to. But I'm just a little nervous."</p> <p>"It's okay, honey," she said, "as long as you don't mind me washing your butt."</p> <p>She took my hard cock in her hands and slowly rubbed soap onto it. I was amazed at the smoothness of my hands and the slippery feeling of her hand sliding up and down, squeezing the head and rolling it around in her hand. She began to soap my back under my arms and then she let go of my dick, which I immediately grabbed and began to vigorously stroke it. My other hand gently rubbed her pussy through her short shorts, but she had already taken her panties off, and she let me kiss down her neck.</p> <p>She was soaping my naked body with her hands that I started to rub her breasts while we kissed in a steady, rhythmic fashion, with our mouths. She grabbed my face against each other body. Her body under my face on her tits. Her tits, then me on Me, on Her, on Her tits in mine, my face, between Her, my cockâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
