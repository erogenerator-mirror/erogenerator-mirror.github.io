The thought seemed to be coming. The music was over. "Ahhh," she moaned, but Jean Valjean could not help herself. Her mouth fell open. As if a new tune was going to be made her.</p> <p>Her pussy was dripping wet in anticipation of a cock.</p> <p>As her lips parted and the door opened, her heart started racing. Jean Valjean was a virgin. She had her fair share of boys. But this particular cock was the first one she ever saw.</p> <p>The man was not even wearing a bowtie. His long hair hung in front of his brown eyes. Jean Valjean noticed his hands. These hands belonged on some other girl's wrists. Those long fingers were not bound. This man was not going to hurt her. These hands belonged back at her wrists instead of across her breasts. These hands belonged to someone. They were her own hands. Not her own and she was not going to do anything that could possibly harm the man whom she was about to fuck.</p> <p>She was so wet. So horny. She could not believe that she was about to take pleasure in sex. She was about to have sex with this man. Only a girl could have her. Only a girl could have a man. Only a girl could have a man. She held back, so that she would have all of this. Jean Valjean didn't have to think about it. She did not have to take it. She had to give. She opened her mouth and placed a single tear down one of her cheeks. Then she sucked the tear into her mouth. After which she lowered her eyes again. And she took herself to the most gorgeous cock that she had ever had.</p> <p>Jean Valjean wanted to be this guy again. And she thought that she wanted him to be the one she had fucked but never before had she been so aroused to be so naked and so willing. And so eager. That she would let these hard dicks penetrate her and fill her to what felt like a thousand tiny orgasms. But if she was a girl then she must really be a virgin. And Jean Valjean liked that. She liked it so much, a little shyness, a little shyness in herself. She wanted so much to be that girl, not a girl herself. She wanted the handsome man she had kissed, the man she had touched.</p> <p>If it were not for the fact that she was in a bar with her boyfriend having too much free beer to take out of the fridge, she would have felt embarrassed if she was going that way but with an erection. She always felt the tiniest bit embarrassed at that moment but she didn't mind in the least. She did not feel shy at all. She felt a great excitement. She really did feel like this guy, a nice looking man with a strong-looking, yet not too masculine, masculine man with blue eyes. But instead of feeling that great excitement, she just found her pussy getting wetter by the second and could not wait any longer.</p> <p>When she closed the door and turned the lock, Jean Valjean felt like she had just entered some wildest sexual fantasy. She had never felt like this before but she loved being the one who was being penetrated. She felt that she could not go back. She was completely free. She would not have to do it any more. She wanted to do it again.</p> <p>As Jean Valjean approached the bar, she was glad to see that she could not see any sign of the handsome man seated by the bar. He was alone, but she could see something else. His dark eyes gave away his excitement. For a second, it seemed as if the man would be walking away in some other direction. Then, in his head it seemed like a dream and she remembered him kissing her. But the reality was that she could not go home without that man. There were no strings attached but what would she do if he walked back to his car tonight? Or if her boyfriend walked back to his car tonight? Even if he saw her naked and wanted her, what would a boy do without looking at her sexy face to see her naked body? Would he have seen her with a real lover's cock in his hand? Or would it be more likely that this man would take her instead?</p> <p>She sat there looking at her reflection. She was in a trance and her own body felt hot. And she was looking at herself in the mirror. "Wow," she thought. "I really can do that," she thought, "I really can do that!"</p> <p></p> <p>She had to keep thinking about these things for so much as she could not. "Keep going back to the manning about her heart, to this moment in her own heart in time. And she had stopped in time, she really, there could never go back—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
