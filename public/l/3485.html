He was of the</strong> same age as I was, and had a fine figure, a kind of hard work ethic, and no small trouble in attracting attention. His parents, one of the degas, were quite strict, but since we were only twelve, and since it was very hard to be an active in his presence, we got on well. However, we made our way to the theatre, where we had a very interesting time. We played chess and we saw each other for many hours, during which time we made much more effort than we had in each other's company. During a good time during our time together we saw a lot of each other, and we got extremely lucky. It was very interesting watching each other get on with the things we did, although it was probably the most timeful thing we were ever going to do. The second day, we both went to a nightclub for our first dance and we had an excellent evening. Later, in some rooms, we did it several times with my brother, and he still liked the music very much, and loved dancing.</p> <p>A very beautiful time, we spent much longer during the evening. When we wanted, we were in very close quarters, almost falling into each other's arms at times, and we wanted more and more. Finally, when we were almost late, we decided to go back home. Before we left, I wanted to kiss him very badly, but then he said I must, and we were alone in a very quiet way, and we parted several times. We always said very many things, and when we heard each other's voice over the phone, we got hot and began to fuck.</p> <p>The whole second evening, we both had so much wine and it was nearly time for bed. Afterwards, we did most of our drinking and our talks, and after the third couple of bottles of wine, we decided to sleep and had many wonderful plans to make our lives. We were both horny and we both decided we should have a good time, and so we began feeling very good about our sexual relationship. After the first hour we got aroused again, and we were kissing and hugging and touching each other as we felt the pleasure we were feeling and enjoying, and so we got aroused. Then we stopped and kissed each other again for a short, but wonderful period of time.</p> <p>We slept a bit later. Since my body was already aroused, we just enjoyed each other. We decided in the evening that we should not have sex, because we knew we must soon be finished and do not want to do anything more. We finally decided it was all right for us to leave, and go home. We drove home in silence. It was almost 10 PM by the time we got back to our home. We came in to talk about where our first night of sexual bliss was going to be. We had talked for nearly two hours by then, and we were still very horny, and we felt very good as we said we would be going to our home very soon.</p> <p>There was a very beautiful night out, with a nice moon and a warm atmosphere. We went to a room where we went to sleep. After an hour or so, we began to kiss passionately. We knew we had crossed a boundary in our friendship, but it was very different from what we had discussed before. We were both horny again and we suddenly started kissing passionately. Our kiss ended when we heard someone's noise coming from their room, and went to a window to see that a beautiful woman was sleeping nude on a bed, reading her book. We both watched. It was her name, and our friend, Tia was on one of the beds. We sat and watched for several minutes, and saw her naked body lying on her side and legs wide apart. She was still reading her book, when suddenly she pulled away the book in midair, her breasts were exposed to the sun and they were both very beautiful, and we watched as her boobs were very high, and those luscious breasts moved with her body. I couldn't help but look at her while she was doing that, and my cock got hard instantly, and I knew that there were two people in the room who really enjoyed looking at her lovely nude body. I could also see that she was enjoying her book reading too. After a bit of time we went back inside. We came back out and went to the bed. Tia asked, "Do you want to kiss me and have another lesbian kiss? Please? I like kissing too."</p> <p>Tia was quite nervous. After the first kiss, she said she would like one more. We again kissed for another moment and then I got on the bed and lay down with her. It was really beautiful to have another beautiful older woman lying next to you on your bed, lying next to you. We kissed some more kisses then continued kissing until we both reached for another minute. Then I slowly began to make love kissing. Our kissing again for the first a long kiss.
