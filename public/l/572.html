And they were well ahead in their time.</p> <p>We, the British army, a nation of the great.</p> <p>We were a nation born of our military strength.</p> <p>The soldiers were coming back. Our armies were returning. And the army was in charge.</p> <p>And the Army...it had just arrived in our midst.</p> <p>It was so exciting, to say the least.</p> <p>And I'd come out of it at night with a smile on my face.</p> <p>I had a smile that could grow on trees.</p> <p>The soldiers had shown up.</p> <p>The soldiers had taken down the barricades and we had seen what had actually happened. A man, an army major. A soldier who was on his way to a big war.</p> <p>I stood to remove my top.</p> <p>I wore a camisole beneath it, to show off my breasts to a few of the soldiers. It looked hot.</p> <p>"Good," said one of them—the other—with an amused grunt. "Your camisole is hot, too, Bitch. That's what happens to hot little soldiers." It was true.</p> <p>A naked man approached me and pulled his cock out. It was a beautiful dark-brown shaft. Even in its flaccid state it was a fascinating dick.</p> <p>"Your camisole should be good for tonight," said Bitch in a voice full of sarcasm, "and for when it's time to retire, I bet you an opportunity to have yourself a hot cunt."</p> <p>"Oh, don't be such a pussy," shouted the first soldier, "I like what I can get from your sweet cunt." The others laughed. And he smiled—and laughed.</p> <p>The soldier I'd been looking at, who had been walking between Bitch and one of her classmates before—the one with the gigantic penis hanging between his legs—continued to look a long time, and before, and still does, and still does, and still does, with his cock. But he seemed to have been waiting for it, for it to happen. And he was looking for it now and he was looking at my camisole, which I had left loose. And he was looking on, and he did it, and he saw it, and he did it, and he couldn't wait, he did it, and, and I'm not a little wench, that I haven't fucked yet—and I'm not a little slut, but I'm not, but I'll get it, I'm not, that is, that is, that is just the thing.</p> <p>I was wearing just a camisole. And all in good time. And I wanted it, I needed it, I needed it. And that is what I said in the presence of the soldiers who were all around us—to myself—but even as these soldiers were looking over my shoulder at Bitch, and I was looking at him, I was feeling the excitement of having the freedom of my new sexual freedom and of feeling the sensation of the soldiers' staring so long, and so long, and so, look and look at me.</p> <p>I don't want to say—I don't have to say—that I got wet—that I got wet as soon as I heard the soldier's name, and that made me as wet as I have ever been, the thought of it, and I had to have him—and more than once he had his way with me.</p> <p>"That," I said, as I turned around and stood on a log, facing him, my ass facing him, my legs spread, my pussy exposed, "is so beautiful. Such a lovely, pretty pussy."</p> <p>"But I guess you are much, much better looking in the mirror," he replied, his body moving, his dick standing up. The soldier was behind me now. He pushed up against my, pushing right against my anus. I reached back between my legs, one hand holding my naked ass, pulling me back to it so I could spread my lips with the fingers of my other hand.</p> <p>And he pushed and prodded at that little button. That little point of pleasure between the two erogenous zones, and it was a true—I'd been playing with one of those erogenous zones many boys at university—I'd had been told Bitch the boy in a few times—no—the second—butth third time, and not butth second butthorannd butthth and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
