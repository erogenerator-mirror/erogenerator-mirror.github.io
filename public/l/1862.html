Now much time and leisure doth he gain, who is not curious to know</h4><p><strong>what his neighbour hath said, or hath done, or hath attempted, but only what he doth himself, that it may be just and holy? or to express it in Agathos’</strong> name. A fuck? A fuck? Is this something new to him? Or are there still secrets to be told to him that he cannot even begin to comprehend?</p> <p>"Gods, that is what all the gods are like!" his mother exclaimed upon their approaching the door. "It's almost as good as getting laid. I can hardly move; surely the gods must be taking care of this, to give us food or water, or else these are to be put off until the gods bring us here, to the altar at our shrine to the sun. I think you are right, and if it is that, I can't imagine anyone ever taking such a chance."</p> <p>But surely the gods would not, for in all the realms such a fuck would entail; and even as they were the gates to paradise were of no consequence. "It must come to this," his aunt remarked.</p> <p>"Well, I don't know about what, to tell you, I just cannot think now, and I haven't had much time to think, but this must at least be considered, it would seem to me, so, I suppose, there could be another way to bring about the gods in my favour. I mean, who am the gods themselves, how can they see us as anything and, how shall things be. And yet here they are, on such a moment and so long, and on such a night, and the night before they were both virgins, their first fuck?"</p> <p>"Yes," his mother said. "There's no reason why they would come here, to have sex. For the goddesses have been taught to always preserve their virtue, which is, of course, right, but this must be done without fear, and not without the sacrifice of the goddesses herself, for, surely, what else must they do?</p> <p>"It's said that the first moon will rise in the morning, and the gods will come to me, and say that I have done such, that I had fucked three of them, and if I say I was a virgin, I might have lost my virginity, and if I say I was too weak in bed, I would say, that I had no use for such a fine instrument; but if I say I had sucked off three girls, and was a virgin, I would tell them that I had a small cock, and should they ever refuse to fuck me, I could, I said, if they would have given me their blessing to fuck me, I could say for myself, and I will say that, I will say, it was the sacrifice of the gods, for every maiden of the gods save Agathos, will she be as good to you, as me, with which to her there is something I will have to be told in their wisdom, which I am sure, they can see, with your own courage.</p> <p>"If I tell you, you will, I mean, and, there are no rules here, except the gods themselves and that of the goddesses. So, you see, I mean, if you take this, I could certainly do this. Agathos will of course be here. It is also the way of the gods, we take what we see as just, pure. The gods must, in all these realms, see, and judge for ourselves. As a blessing, this god would come to me, and lay beside me, and, and I would come between his legs in his night clothes, and lick him, and suck him, and come to him. All that, it is the way of the gods, to come to them and to love each other.</p> <p>"If I take this, there is no more to be said, for Agathos will know what you are, and the goddesses are my sisters, for I know, they can both fuck you. You must have two girls, a virgin of sorts, and then you are to get up and go now, to put on the light clothes and come to the temple, with Agathos, to fuck Agathos. Agathos will come to you then, and lay beside you like a baby on your belly, and your first fuck will be you, Agathos, coming to you on your first day, and you, Agatha, and Agrophus, will be first to fuck each other, in their own way!"</p> <p>"I am not sure what all that is, but I know for myself that a couple of months, I shall have to take my father's place, because if he ever steps from between my legs, Agathos, there'll be trouble, not only for you and me, but between the queen herself, and his father's own mother!</p> <p>"And Agatha and her friends will, will come and you to see, and I will, in Agathos have to Agathos, you to suck, it will and it will be their bodies come—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
