English by Fyodor Dostoyevsky </h3><h4>CHAPTER I</h4><p><strong>So he lay a very long while. Now and then he seemed to wake up, and at such moments he noticed that it was far into the night, but it</strong> didn't seem to matter; the light came on and he felt the cold hard reality: he was awake! All around him was the sound of birdsong, and a very loud voice was asking him to say something. And now he knew that, with this great knowledge, the night of a sleep wouldn't be over very long, he had to be really dreaming.</p> <p>All night long he'd be looking down his slumber as he fell into a deep slumber. He was dreaming in his sleep of a very beautiful woman. He was looking down at her, lying in an all but nakedness that was all a dream. He could almost feel her body pressed against his and every movement she made, felt. And he could feel his cock press hard against her as they stood in the middle of their room, his cock and balls pressed against her body. It was so warm and cosy with the light. So soft and cosy. She was laying there in his bed naked, as he walked towards her, his cock still pressed hard against her body.</p> <p>He looked up from her eyes as she smiled and looked directly into his eyes, and in a second he saw her smile widen as she reached out her hand and gently cupped his rock hard cock with her palm. She stroked it and smiled. He felt her hands on his cock, and it didn't take much of this before he felt the same warmth and soft pressure against his cock that he remembered from earlier that morning. Her hand felt cool against him, and for a moment he felt as cold as she. Almost like she was sitting on his cock, he shivered as his cock hardened. Her hands felt so good. He could feel how warm, how soft and smooth they were, and it was her breasts in his eyes that he felt so hard. The feeling of her skin and her breath was electrifying to him, but the feeling was even better as she felt his cock hardening between her breasts. It's hardening against her skin makes her nipples so hard and hard against his.</p> <p>So he felt one of her hands move from his cock to his balls and caressing them. He felt a slight touch of her hands as they made their way upwards around his cock and gently squeezed it as she felt it up against her soft breasts. She felt so warm, so soft, and so incredibly hard. He could feel the warmth and the softness of her breasts against his cock, felt as if she was standing on his cock, and it was the very next moment that he felt himself become completely rock hard in her hands. When she felt he was fully hard, she stopped her touch and looked down in amazement. She looked so sexy that she stood there, smiling, as she slowly undressed him!</p> <p>"Oh my god, that feels amazing! I can feel your hard cock against my boobies!" She spoke as she slowly lowered her hands from him, feeling the cold air against her bare breasts as she did. She saw the look of surprise on his face, and she smiled wickedly at him as she took his rock hard cock in her hand and rubbed it along her breasts. Then she looked up at him, and she lifted up from the bed and she put her head down over his cock, and she lowered it so that it was pressed right against her soft lips. She opened her mouth and felt it enter in, felt it slide across her lips. They kissed, and he felt as if they were one in a very long and sexy kiss. She didn't just feel his cock, she also felt her breasts against him, felt the warm hardness and soft feel of something warm and hard against her skin. And all of a sudden he felt her mouth, and it was her tongue that was gently probing his mouth and sending messages straight to his groin. Then she kissed him again, and he felt her tongue gently caressing his. It was so wonderful. He felt the sweet intimacy between them as they kissed, felt as if they were one person. He could feel himself becoming as close to this wonderful woman as he felt before and it was the best moment that he had ever experienced in his life. He felt as if he was in an orgasm, as if she was the one causing his pleasure, as she felt the most intimate contact, as he felt what she felt. And both of them began to make love in the bed, and for a moment, even her lips felt as if they were moving closer on top of each other, as if they would kiss each other more as they made love, as they slowly became one.</p> <p>The feeling of feeling her against him, feeling the warmth and her softness of her body against his, and his erect cock pressed against him, as they made love, as they joined it made love was and made love and made love, made love seemed to each other, and made love, as lovers, as lovers make love, love was love to the way, as lovers were to love, asâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
