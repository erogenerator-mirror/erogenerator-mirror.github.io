He sat up and rubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he comprehended. It was the cool gray dawn,</strong> the day he had been dreaming about. He lay back down as the sun came through the window. "Hello," he whispered.</p> <p>"Hey," she said, hugging him. She took her time, rubbing her hands over his chest, his ribs, around his chest, her fingers tracing the muscles of his arms and abdomen. "You're a nice person." She said as she rubbed her hands over his cock. He had been dreaming of this kind of relationship for so long that the dreams had suddenly become reality. And he was the beneficiary of it. He was in love with her, the person she was. Her mind raced.</p> <p>She smiled and said, "I'm a lucky woman."</p> <p>"I can't agree more with you." he said.</p> <p>"Me either." she said.</p> <p>"We can go to bed in my room or my bed or wherever we choose." he said, kissing her. "I'm in love with you, I'm in love with you."</p> <p>She put her arm around his waist. "You're so good for me."</p> <p>"No I'm not. I'm never going to marry. Just give it your best." he smiled. "Let's go get something to eat." He rose off the bed and headed after him.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>"How do we do it?" Susan asked. She lay on Tom's bed. Her hands were in his shirt. "We can't. Let's just lay here, okay? Just watch." She moved her hands and massaged his chest, his shoulders, his back. His chest. And then she moved her hands down to his lower back, tracing lines of his skin. He lifted one leg and then the other and she moved down to his thighs. She pulled his shorts down. She saw the bulge under his boxers. She pulled his boxers off as his cock sprung up and into view. Susan smiled but didn't move.</p> <p>Tom grinned. He liked the look. Susan removed his boxer briefs, which she saw were also wet. She looked at his cock, which was semi-erect. She looked at his beautiful, hard cock.</p> <p>"Do you want me to do you?" she asked.</p> <p>"Not here. Why not?"</p> <p>"Because we have to get to bed first. I don't want to get to sticky. Not this early." she said, but she leaned back in the bed.</p> <p>"I agree, but then I'll start the fucking." Tom said, sitting down on the bed. Susan lay down on it beside him, facing him.</p> <p>"So... you liked that?" she said, as she took the head of his cock into her mouth.</p> <p>"Well, yes, but it's been over 10 years since I've had sex." he said, as Susan slid her mouth down the length of his cock. He let out a sigh as pleasure filled him.</p> <p>"Oh God." she sighed, looking at his face as she sucked the head of his dick. She cupped his ball sack. Slowly she pulled his balls from her mouth.</p> <p>Tom looked at her. She looked so damn sexy like that. "You're too sexy, that's so sexy." he said.</p> <p>She kissed his lips and said, "I'm glad I can make you feel good."</p> <p>"How do you make me feel better?" he asked, looking at her face.</p> <p>"Good." she pulled her mouth from his cock and looked at him, kissing his face.</p> <p>"You make me feel good." she whispered, moving her lips to his ear.</p> <p>"I'm happy to be pleased with you." he smiled as he ran his fingers through her hair.</p> <p>She took his hand and ran her fingers through it, feeling her way down her body. She kissed his palm.</p> <p>Tom's heart began to beat harder as his brain raced. "What are you doing, Susan?"</p> <p>"I'm just making myself feel sexy." She said, moving down to his cock.</p> <p>"This time it'll be on my cock." Tom said, stroking her as she placed his hand on her breast.</p> <p>Susan began sucking his cock, sliding her head up and down. "Oh, I like it," she said as she licked the precum oozing from the slit. She moved his hand to her breasts, cupping them and squeezing them.</p> <p>Tom's balls began to grow heavier, indicating his impending release.</p> <p>Susan moved his hand faster on her breast. "Mmmm... I like that. It feels so nice on my breasts... it makes me feel good." she said as she moved her hand faster.</p> <p></p> <p>She moved faster on his cock. His hand, sucking harder, her lips, sliding on his shaft... on his cock; moving faster. "Mmmm... Mmmmâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
