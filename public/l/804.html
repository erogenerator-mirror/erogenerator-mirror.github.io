Four times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times it wasted to nothingness in his</strong> hands. It seemed as though every fiber of his body was being caressed by fingers and tongues as he fucked the very fingers that owned his heart, mind and soul. Tom was fucking the life out of two of the most beautiful and sweetest looking women in the world. When he heard that name in your mind his heart gave a flutter and began fucking. Yes, he was fucking them. They were gorgeous and he couldn’t wait to get those two out of his life. And so was his hard cock buried in the sweet mouth of a woman that could never, ever, be near him, nor would he. The women he knew and loved in the world, the one that he loved and wanted to love, were in his life.</p> <p>So that night, just like every other night had come before, Tom fucked in various ways but always the memory of those sweet lips on his cock, that sweet tongue working its way up his body, his sexy body sucking on his hard cock, was always with that hot and eager mouth and loving tongue of hers on his mind. The thought of those lips licking up and down his rock hard cock was a sight he would have wanted for many years. But now his dream was about to be fulfilled. He was finally fucking a young woman that was going to be his forever and he couldn’t wait to get her to sit on his cock in return.</p> <p>The memory of those lips licking around his cock brought Tom over the edge and when he opened his eyes to watch her straddle his lap and slide down on his hard shaft. Tom looked at the sexy woman riding him and all he could think of was the way those sexy lips were wrapped around his cock. He watched her hips and he saw the way her thighs hungrily squeezing his hips. Tom had his hands back on those smooth, sexy hips and he couldn’t keep them still as he fucked her. She bounced up and down and the look on her face was one of pleasure and satisfaction. In addition to the beautiful girl being bouncing up and down on Tom’s cock so much, there was something else.</p> <p>Her hips were so sexy that when she got close to Tom’s face he would lick her lips. He loved to have his lips on hers. He loved the way she could draw his tongue deeper inside her and that tongue was so good. He loved the way he could always feel her tongue running around his lips and down his face, the way her juices would run into his mouth and down his chin and on to his chest. The combination of his lips and tongue were in contact with her clit as she rode him. He couldn’t keep his dick in place inside this sexy girl so he had to reach around her so that he could rub her clit, he could reach underneath her so one of his hands could rub her firm nipples. The feeling of having her clit massaged and then sucked and pinched by his tongue as she bounced up and down, the feeling of having her sexy hips bounce up and down as she rode him while Tom was sucking her clit and finger fucking her clit while sucking on her delicious button made Tom so hard that he thought both nipples could cum on his chest.</p> <p>Then the look of pleasure came over her face and it told Tom all he needed to know. Tom had never felt it as intense as the sensation he was feeling was when his cock was inside her. Her whole body clenched, unyielding, and undaunted just the way he and her bodies were. Her hips gyrated ever faster, pushing and pulling and pushing him, forcing him deeper and deeper inside her. And then, when the pleasure came to a screeching halt she started to cry and a guttural sound of ecstasy came from her throat. God that sound! That sound made Tom think again that it was the sound of pleasure not the sound of having a woman orgasm. And with that she let out a long moan and a shudder of pleasure that pushed Tom over the edge and sent him over the edge.</p> <p>It was a feeling he would never forget. It was such a feeling. Tom’s thoughts were fuzzy when he thought about the experience. He felt a warm trickle of sperm run down his shaft and down his balls. Tom was lost in thought and lost himself to the wonder he felt while laying in his bed in the morning after his dream. He was lost in that night with that gorgeous woman, that beautiful face again, the sweet smell of her sex, and still the way his cock felt when it was buried deep inside her wet and tight pussy.</p> <p>It would be so hard, so hard for Tom to explain to himself why the dreams began to become so much more real. Why the one would go with things that he was doing and the other than what he was thinking or thought, while his dreaming as he couldn’d become something deeper and not just another fantasy. It would be something that was so—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
