Cosette came with M. Fauchelevent.—“This is reversing things,” said Mademoiselle Gillenormand, “to have the bride come to the house to do the courting</strong> and, of course, the boudoir.” And the two girls got off the bed before their guest arrived.</p> <p>“We will have you dressed in dresses, and you will go to Paris to see her,” said Mademoiselle.</p> <p>The pair of them were in their undies for the night. “Come, darling,” said Cosette, and she led the couple out into the night. The pair of them, and the groom in their undies, all night, had fucked each other until they had to stop the act, and they, all at once, were exhausted and glowing.</p> <p>“To the house, to the boudoir, to the chapel. It must seem so long. You will do it for me, then.” And she was gone, and Cosette opened the door to her cottage.</p> <p>It was full, and it was beautifully furnished. The door was not closed. Its light was on now, of course, and it must be full of their guest. One of Cosette's toys was under the pillow. It was red. It was not the strap-on. It was black.</p> <p>“In the room,” Cosette said aloud, and her new master and lover entered, naked, her back to him. He embraced her waist, kissed her cheek, and pulled her onto his lap. Cosette was naked. Her new lover, his eyes were on hers, as did the others in the room. He had to be careful not to get hard for her. She had made herself comfortable on her bended knee, just like any other woman. Her new Master had already fucked his wife. He felt the stir that the evening gave him.</p> <p>The young woman spread her legs, and arched her hips, as she raised her pussy lips to show her Master, then took his throbbing dick in hand to guide it into her. Her mouth formed a circle as she sucked the head and felt it penetrate her to the hilt, stretching her. They fucked, of them they fucked, of them they fucked, and there they fucked, and each of them fucked, and fucked, and fucked, and fucked. Cosette was wet. The girl writhed under her in ecstasy as her Master penetrated her. He fucked the bride. He held her by her ass cheeks. Cosette had the head inside her while she humped the cock in her pussy. The cock was in her body. She orgasmed in the way she liked. She made the man who fucked her cum in her and suck him off. She fucked him. She loved the taste of him so.</p> <p>There was a woman, a naked, slim blonde woman, holding Cosette's legs open for her to suck him. On the bedside table, she was a woman, a woman from the past two days, and she was sucking the dildo. In Cosette’s bedroom the scene was beautiful as it was in a mirror on the wall of the bedroom. He had her naked, his body on hers, her on top of him, with the black woman under the black one, her head on his shoulder, a woman from the past twelve hours, and her pussy wrapped around his cock.</p> <p>Cosette could feel him move and enter her again. She had lost herself in his cock. He had stopped when he was hard. He had moved into her, entering her again and again, entering her. He was fucking her. She was fucking herself on his cock, taking him fully inside. They fucked, they fucked, and they fucked, and they fucked and fucked. He held her ass cheeks apart in an invitation to enter her anus. He held himself, pushed, and she relaxed. Cosette wanted to feel him in there.</p> <p>The bride's tongue and her lips slid into the wet hole of the blond. Cosette was a little disappointed with her pussy. The pussy that she got only on the side of the cock in it, but not on what Cosette wanted inside of her. The new owner of the cunt was better. She would have the cunt, and she would be the mouth. Cosette opened herself. Munch was in her mouth. She didn’t want there to be someone else in the room. She didn’t want her lips touching Munch. She didn’t want anybody else to know that she was the one taking the dick. Cosette could feel the tongue flicking on her clit and ass. She could not help herself. She started on the cock to get the cum from him.</p> <p>The new owner of the cunt, she had to suck it. Cosette loved the taste a cock in her daughter. Cosette licked the cock for pussy as it, she licked it, she licked, she loved the ass, she sucked, and she sucked for she loved sucking it—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
