Therefore I ask you to take the time to read the remainder Of The Discourse, which will introduce a new chapter of my life.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>A week or so after their encounter with John, Jennifer and John stopped by John's office. He was sitting inside looking at his old desk, with his laptop lying on it.</p> <p>"We have just taken a new step in our relationship. We are now starting to truly live out our fantasies...we just don't know if we can. The idea of letting each other know that we are all in it is exhilarating, but the idea of sharing with the other is equally invigorating. I'm happy that our first couple of steps will be our secret. What am I thinking about when I'm sharing those thoughts with you?"</p> <p>"My fantasy is to give you a lover. That's why we had that discussion. I'm thinking you could do anything with a lover. I'm thinking, that you would love to have the attention, as my slut and as your whore."</p> <p>"I'm excited, because I want to take you against your will again. I want to be with you, to feel each caress to our bodies, to watch you get more and more aroused with each passing moment. You will look like I'm about to enter the room for a second. I'd just stand there and watch if you were ready."</p> <p>"Of course I'm ready. I'm ready!"</p> <p>"That's okay, I just want to stay in character with you."</p> <p>"Of course you do. We are going to make love like you said. Is that a challenge or not?"</p> <p>"Yes, of course it is. Now how about having some breakfast?"</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>As soon as the door closed, Jennifer started undressing for him. She had put on an off-white tank top with a lacy frill which displayed her breasts nicely. The buttons were undone, and was clearly visible. She had a pair of panties on underneath which were clearly visible. As she slowly pulled them off over her hips, her ass and pussy were completely exposed. She had not planned to let her panties stay that way - even though she had planned to wear them for him. He had thought that she had not had him topless. Then he had imagined her naked, and now he was fully aware of the reality of his own nudity.</p> <p>"Let's go and put these on. I want these to look perfect from this side," he said, taking her in his arms. He was completely turned on, and he quickly stripped off his clothes, tossing them aside. She had never seen a man's naked body before, and his penis which she couldn't decide whether to be small or fat.</p> <p>She climbed on his lap, straddling his stomach with her legs. She was wearing stockings with the seam of the garters attached to the garters: and a thong. Her pussy was already wet. She slid her fingers through her neatly trimmed bush to tease herself and tease his cock.</p> <p>John was in the middle of the kitchen floor with Jennifer on top. It was quite clear that she had been enjoying his attentions and was ready for him. She had already started sliding herself up and down on his erect cock. It looked pretty good. She was looking great from behind. Her breasts were bouncing nicely when she bounced up and down on his shaft. He had felt that he had to take his hands off her breasts to do that, but she kept bouncing herself onto his cock, driving herself down, and moving herself up, grinding at his groin.</p> <p>Finally, he sat up, taking her in his arms. She kissed him passionately, while she reached between them and started rubbing herself. John was aching for her. The moment he had dreamed of for a very long time, she had shown him she was ready, and ready to be part of his new life.</p> <p>"John, would you let my love give you a little love massage before we start our dinner?"</p> <p>John stood up, and led Jennifer to the middle of the kitchen floor. They moved to the couch, where they had started their first passionate moment. She sat down, and he knelt between her outstretched thighs. He put his hands on her belly, rubbing up and down and in and around her soft, moist pussy. She moaned softly. He used his fingers to spread her lips apart, and kissed the entire area of her pussy. After moving around the outside of her labia, and making her wet with his tongue, he slowly started opening her vagina. He was amazed at how his tongue could move from left and a little to right, as he moved from right, and he moved in, and side and back and up and inside and out and back againâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
