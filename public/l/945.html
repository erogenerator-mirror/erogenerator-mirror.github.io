Madeleine is no other than Jean Valjean. We have already gazed into the depths of this conscience; the moment has now</strong> become the moment.</p> <p>I have the right to say this I must, of all my friends and fellow authors, proclaim, unequivocally, in my consciousness, "The most famous of all forms of pornography will never be fornicated upon or filmed for public viewing."</p> <p>A man can kiss a beautiful woman, can kiss her breasts, can kiss her bush, she can kiss her toes through the length of her legs. A woman can lick a pussy for the first time, if only with open tonguing. A woman can suck a pussy to orgasm. A woman can wear lingerie, or wear panties. A man can have sex with a woman in their bed. A man has a cock, or a cunt, which he is going to fuck. A woman can have fun with a pussy that would otherwise be filled with a man's cock. A woman can have fun doing men (or a man, to be more precise). A woman can have fun with a man's cock. I can, for example, have fun with the art of kissing a beautiful woman. A woman can have fun having fun with men. A woman can take a cock (or a girl), or a boy's cock (anywhere, anytime) in her ass. A woman can have some interesting things to do by sucking a man's cock.</p> <p>A woman can get the most out of anything she does. She's very good at doing something sexy, or exciting. She's got great sense of humor and a sense of fun. Her pussy knows how to have fun. There's no better sign of her joy than a woman's mouth or cunt when she's doing something very naughty. I've no doubt that her pussy must be dripping, and wet, in a very literal form.</p> <p>I am now thinking of a moment, and I shall soon have some thoughts of my own. I have the right to express my thoughts to the readers, but please, please read on and vote.</p> <p>If there is something you'd like to read, or perhaps find some other action to my characters, you'll like this one. My story is based on events prior to the events I shall tell you. This story takes place shortly after the beginning of the twentieth century, in the seventies, and I suspect that will continue well into the seventies, in the seventies as many other things, but some things remain as we know them now. This story takes place in the year seventeen hundreds, the year that became an English school.</p> <p>I have been writing, thus far, and I have just discovered a thing, and it is one of the longest and the most profound things that anyone has written to me. I just recently learned that I am, indeed, going to find the joy of life anew during these fifty years.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>THE GENTLEMEN OF GENTLEMEN</p> <p>"To the most beautiful woman on the planet, to the most beautiful woman on the planet, all are worth more than one hundred thousand dollars," said the author of the first and the most famous book of the year, Richard Fenton. He was reading his third to the most famous book of the year, The Art of Making Love.</p> <p>The author had found a niche within his particular community, a small area in New England, with a small town, its inhabitants mostly middle class, with more than one wife (although on a quiet Monday there was little and no need of a party). He wrote those book books to be loved and admired by anyone to the point that he often became a celebrity.</p> <p>He was living his story of the New England past, when his sister, Mary, became very wealthy, and he decided to go for broke and do things his way.</p> <p>"Where I came from, what I'm about to share with you will not take place in English history, nor will it lead you to many different perspectives of the past, but let's go with the truth, shall we?</p> <p>First, let me tell you what I've come here to write, to see, and to learn, as we are, and as far as the reader is concerned. I can't speak the language of other countries where I live, as I am in London. It's the United States that I live in, rather than England.</p> <p>"That is to say, to my parents where I'm from, there's no other word. I have no idea what I might have accomplished with my education during the years when my mother went to Africa. We didn't even know all of it, but we've all learned enough about English literature from our English masters, to know that it isn't so difficult to have the right to love English.</p> <p>"I'm not to say this, in all of course with all the joy a woman, but some women in England. Buttnay. If I must have a lady. I must know that woman to be a lover love—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
