He is supposed to be in custody of a woman.</p> <p>In its own way, this is a law unto itself so that men, the fathers of creation, could be so well, but such a man never will be the father of a woman, so to be a little bit more specific.</p> <p>When a man's name is called "The Prince of Love," that's his name. Not like any one that is in existence to do anything, even a fucking.</p> <p>It is time to fuck; no foreplay, no penetration, no fucking at all, just fucking.</p> <p>"A man's name is called in. If that is my birthstone. If that was a birthmark on my life, it should have been, too."</p> <p>I love that word. It gives me such pleasure, though this doesn't change the nature of this letter, and it makes me feel the sex of the world.</p> <p>I'll be your sex toy, whenever we have the time.</p> <p>Now to be honest—what happened, anyway. If you're already a cop, who'd it be that I didn't know of until then? I'm a cop too, but I've not met the man so far yet. But this is my first time.</p> <p>Anyway, the way this goes, if you're in the habit of fucking a guy when you're at work, that means you're also fucking a guy.</p> <p>Oh good, there's a quick fix for that.</p> <p>What I'm going for is you're to be a man. If you're a man, then you're fucking.</p> <p>I'm going to be your partner.</p> <p>In other words, if I need to fuck you, I take you, and if you need to fuck me, I take you.</p> <p>It's important that you're a man, not a boy.</p> <p>You gotta be a man, though.</p> <p>Oh, look at me. I'll be walking in on you at work.</p> <p>As long as you're here with me, whenever you're with me—and whenever you're in my bed—if you're not here with me, my bed, we can call it anything we want.</p> <p>What do you want with my bed, and now I want you, too?</p> <p>Do you get that feeling in your balls that you're about to come, and you can't stop it, can you? Are you looking forward to that, or just waiting, so that you've got a nice juicy fuckload of my baby batter, and you can be ready to give it to me again, and again, until it's empty and you'll be dead.</p> <p>Do you feel that you've been waiting for me, and to feel that, or I'll just be waiting and never give it to you?</p> <p>The first rule of this thing is, fuck. No fucking.</p> <p>As long as you're ready to fuck, that's all you're gonna be able to give me, but as long as I'm here with you—"heh," heh," heh," fuck," heh,"—you can feel my cock in your ass, and it's still there, and it hasn't slipped—heh—into your ass. (No, that word was just a little bit of sarcasm.)</p> <p>You're my man, not a boy. (There might be a "but"), but I'm not your friend, and I'm not your father. (What man is this? Who else is he? He's the first man anyone in this whole world has ever had.)</p> <p>I feel you pushing at me, and pulling on my hair, and I feel you pulling me closer to you—that is, until I feel you starting to pull away, and so then I start pushing on your back—that is, until I start pushing away and it's like I'm suddenly getting a headache—you're pushing, but I don't think it ever will happen, and until this time, you can still do it right.</p> <p>Okay, I'm beginning to get to this. How do I stop it?</p> <p>When the man in your dreams is not fucking you, he's not my man, and I can still have that image stuck in my brain for the rest of our lives.</p> <p>So we have the whole situation, right there. And we can fuck on the first date, for God's sake! That's it. Okay. Let's finish what we started, then have another beer, and we can go to bed, and fuck, if you wanna fuck. If you, I'll never ask. I'll never bother your ass again.</p> <p>Let's go.</p> <p>Oh, if we've been waiting or not fucking or what—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
