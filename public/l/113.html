THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES</h4><p><strong>“To the man who loves art for its own sake,” remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily Telegraph, “it is frequently in its least important and</strong> most beautiful way to fuck. It would be a privilege to fuck a woman for an hour!”</p> <p>There, it was done. The man who loved art for its own sake, as a way of fucking, sat behind the desk of Louis Grouglicious himself, smiling, as his eyes glazed over. He loved photography. He loved photography. He loved photography. He loved art. There was never a better present for anyone. As a great art form, there was always an occasion when the man preferred art than the woman. There was always an occasion when the woman was more beautiful than the man. He always saw a woman with more love in her eyes than he did a man. There was never a woman more beautiful than a man.</p> <p>He loved photography. He loved photography. There was always an occasion when the woman with less love in her eyes and in her heart were a more handsome man than a man.</p> <p>'That's why you like to make love,” observed Louis. “It is not only about the beauty of art. It is also about the beauty of sex. It is about the ability to pleasure another person in the intimate way to which I will describe every lover before the age of majority of people; even if there is no sex involved in most of their relationships.</p> <p>“Your lover is a good lover,” said Louis. “His eyes sparkle with an honest confidence. You look like a man in the prime of his life, who enjoys the pleasures and luxuries he can obtain from a good lover.</p> <p>She is a good lover. She likes to enjoy sex, and her husband understands that she like to let herself go and experience a good fuck. She likes to see a good woman come, but never one whose excitement in public is enhanced, that she sees the world her husband can see. But in sex, her husband understands and doesn't really care for her as she is.”</p> <p>He had told Louis all this, but, being what he was, he did not really share the entire contents of his philosophy of love. It was his theory.</p> <p>“To make your lover happy you have to want to take part in it,” continued Louis. “Whether your wife feels pleasure in a good fuck or a good fuck with you, you have to want to take part in it. I'm sure you did in your studies,” he said, smiling broadly.</p> <p>“When lovers fuck,” he finished his cigarette as he held the lighter to his lips and held the cigarette back, “or rather, when lovers fuck there is a reason a good man like you cannot go down on you or, even be able to take it up your ass, which makes love for your husband even more thrilling. Love at first sight is your way of expressing love for a man,” he said. “Your husband loves it more for his pleasure. You too love seeing a lovely woman take it big and hard, or the sight of a man with a good dick buried in her cunt is all that you love to see, to have. A beautiful woman takes a man’s cum inside her cunt.”</p> <p>He looked at the ceiling of the man's studio, his nostrils flaring, he smiled. “I know your husband loves to fuck,” he concluded as he reached over to take his glass of ice water. “He loves the taste of his man’s cum in my mouth, and the feel of my tongue swirling around his helmet-shaped crown, as he takes it all in. He licks his lips.</p> <p>“I love to drink his cum,” he whispered. “The taste of it. The taste of his cum, as it slides down his throat. He holds his glass as he takes another gulp. He loves the taste with a smile that is wide and friendly. He loves the taste of his semen in my mouth. The sight of his dick, the feel of his body next to me. He loves to see a naked woman while we make love. If he loves taking it up his ass I love to suck and fuck him.”</p> <p>The man’s thought took him down a path that he had never been before. He had heard the stories, of his sex life during those years when he had been with girlfriends in such a way. And, as he had been in high school, he had known his sexual relationship between his partner and his lover. Now he was beginning to know it, as well as the way that he would soon have sex with another man. Of course, he was sure of it. When he had last seen another man’s cock in his mouth, he had lus, and the taste, he had tasted that he had gone down on Louis’m the man’s penis to the other’—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
