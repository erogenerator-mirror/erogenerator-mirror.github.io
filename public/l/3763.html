That's what made him think of taking Oliver's virginity. The way to deal with that is make Oliver yours, he thought to himself. And just as if he was going to put his cock in Oliver's hole, she should too.</p> <p>"Oh my God, it's so big. Do you really have to take it? Oh yeah, it's inside my tight white pussy," the blonde said.</p> <p>"Well, yeah, I guess I need a cock first," Oliver replied. "I have a nice thick cock. There's a guy fucking me on that couch next to yours in that dark room with that damn blindfold on. I think it's the first one. He looks hot."</p> <p>"Fuck him. That's better," Oliver said with a smile. With those words, he leaned over and wrapped his lips around the tip of Oliver's cock. Even with the hood retracted, the tip of his dick looked longer than any cock Oliver had ever seen. He had never touched a dick before, but there was something so erotic about the smell of Oliver's cock, particularly compared to Oliver's, when he was licking him. Even with Oliver's cock being slightly longer, it looked longer and more like his own.</p> <p>And it felt even more erotic when Oliver's hand found the smooth, hot skin of Oliver's shaft. He squeezed it lightly, feeling himself getting harder with each squeeze.</p> <p>It took a few moments before Oliver reached around Oliver to find the zipper on the back of the dark room. He had no intention of just ripping Oliver's shirt off, but instead, Oliver pulled down the zipper slowly, revealing an incredibly tight pair of white cotton panties. Oliver's hand found it easier to do so, because it felt so strange, feeling such tight fabric rubbing against the skin of his own shaft. There was a certain, familiar texture to it that Oliver just couldn't place it.</p> <p>When it occurred to Oliver to touch himself, he stopped. The memory of that night would haunt him for days. Oliver would say something about it later, but that memory would never come. Oliver was so lost in the feeling of sex that what he did with himself, with his hands, with his body was a part of Oliver's entire reality.</p> <p>What Oliver did next should have made this night about the sex that was always the one thing Oliver wanted. But Oliver was not like some guys. He would never fuck on a first date. He had a long drive away, and he would only be coming back for his own. So Oliver would use this time as his opportunity to give Oliver his first experience.</p> <p>"Let's get you out of these," Oliver said as he slowly eased Oliver's pants down.</p> <p>Oliver had no idea what he was doing. He had never touched another mans cock before. It wasn't even close to Oliver's that he'd ever touched. As far as sucking, he had never tasted or fingered another guy's erection. But the feeling of his own soft smooth cock sliding in and out of Oliver's mouth brought a new kind of pleasure.</p> <p>This experience had never happened before. Or was it?</p> <p>"Are you going to do it? Do you want me to do it?" Oliver asked nervously. He knew exactly the right thing to ask, a question that would not require an answer.</p> <p>"Yeah. I mean, if you're going to do it, then I guess it's my time," Oliver said defensively.</p> <p>Oliver paused for a few seconds. Was that a sign of how he wanted to proceed?</p> <p>He had no idea how to go about a first time. That's what happened in the park. Sometimes, it was a short walk over a busy highway and Oliver would do things with his mind. Oliver would lie about how he was leaving school. Oliver told stories about school. Oliver told a story about himself. Oliver liked it when Oliver kept telling him what happened in the park and what he did in the bathroom. Maybe it was the memories about the other night. Or maybe it was just a way to say something that would make Oliver smile in a way that would make him feel really awkward about not wanting to touch a part of himself that wasn't Oliver himself. Maybe it was just that Oliver's mind was blank with emotion. The day, the day which started on a day like this one, just seemed to happen naturally and naturally. Oliver felt good. He felt good. Like Oliver could take care of himself. Maybe a lot of people do that. Oliver didn't really need anyone else. All he needed was someone who would help him find a level of comfort and excitement with Oliver. Oliver felt good in some ways, although Oliver was no substitute for most people. A kind of him. But for Oliver, Oliver his own life, Oliver felt good at least for the same. Oliver felt good.</p> <p></p> <p>And Oliver's he took Oliver.
