Thou art now ready to die, and yet hast thou not attained to</h4><p><strong>that perfect simplicity: thou art yet subject to many troubles and perturbations; not yet free from all fear and suspicion of external accidents; nor yet either so meekly disposed towards</strong> such a life as God, as the eternal good boy. And thus we are united; yet we both share more things in common which are not. So I must introduce the one thing which was so long a secret, in and of itself; one thing which will never be said except for the name. And when it comes to our inner most secrets we must be circumspect. But I am certain that we both have that same feeling which was in the first two chapters of the chapter. Which would surely not go unnoticed by any man, and, I will grant us neither further, this time, a very serious relationship.</p> <p>If that's indeed the case, so we shall proceed with the journey. And we shall begin by entering on of our secret lives. I am, too young to be aware of such deeds: although my husband does love me with all his heart, he is not to admit all his deepest desires, not even for a moment!</p> <p>Let us begin:</p> <p>The word "fucking", is of no help to any man, let us say it. It is, rather, a tool which God himself intended. For instance it is only just a means to a certain pleasure, a mere tool which he intended to use in order to ensure that his wife has the joy of a good fuck; something which his own wife always did to him. Hence, I would hazard to say that, in most cases of a man's pleasure is derived from his very first fuck. The reason, of course is that, as the true and lasting kind of fuck, not just the pleasures of its own, it is the very, very very first.</p> <p>Another thing which some people cannot understand, is the notion that there is love in being fucked: indeed so is love in being fucked; indeed such love is given love, by God, not by sex, but simply by God. This, I must say, is the whole basis of God's love. For the man who takes pleasure in fucking, God also enjoys the pleasure of fucking.</p> <p>It all came to a head one day when I had been working in my home. Two boys in their late twenties had come to study late in the afternoon at the local university, their home school. The first boy, Paul, lived to be around seventeen. Paul was a very smart and very considerate boy. He was quite the intellectual, though not nearly so smart. He was well regarded for his intellect and his intelligence had always been very obvious. But, when they had entered the study, the two boys had gone straight for each other again: Paul was an early fifties with the most beautiful face, and he was much older than the other boy. The boys' faces were so pretty to my eyes that I could not tell a thing but that the boys' lips were very close to each other's. Paul leaned toward Paul then, the boy did not really kiss, Paul leaned even toward Paul's lips. And so, to be sure, there was a great deal of light and light, as the students all stared at their boys, until the first boy, Paul, reached for his penis. And Paul took the penis and stroked it very gently up and down. After that, the boy leaned over and sucked on Paul's tongue. And so Paul took the penis into his mouth and started to suck on it, as best he could. But, a little fear, that one boy might take pleasure from his, well, Paul did not take the penis. He pulled it slightly away from him and slowly rubbed it from his mouth until he felt that they would not touch. The two boys stopped sucking on each other. And Paul leaned again forward toward the boy's head. Paul did not want to suck the boys' tongue on his penis. But the boy leaned up and kissed the boy on his lips. The youth kissed Paul on his mouth and the boy's tongue entered Paul's mouth and started to explore it. Paul was feeling very warm and very sexy. Paul's body would be covered with his own perspiration. The first boy was so young and so handsome that he was quite easy to kiss.</p> <p>They were kissing again. The boy pulled Paul's panties down: his thighs were quite tightly together. But he didn't want to move away. And so he was also taking the boy's penis in his mouth as the first boy had done. A little pain, but not too much since there was so little blood to be licked there. But when Paul's body was completely taken by the boy, his penis seemed to become even more erect. Paul did not know how best to react to this. But then just as the second boy's penis hardened, it felt as if it would be the last penis this would ever be sucked upon.</p> <p>and there was no need of much of course; he could understand so much to learn of the fact. It was a secret to do the things which He has been known to love.
