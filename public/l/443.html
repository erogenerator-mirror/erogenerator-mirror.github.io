Instead the two of them were alone in a small, old wooden chapel which had never been in use. The priest-president, a well-built gray haired man wearing only a small cloth robe, stood up while he surveyed the situation with an expression of a thoughtful detachment.</p> <p>“Yes. It had come to this with more than a sense of urgency because the Emperor needs his own army at his side but we don’t yet have the manpower for the army of our people,” the priest-president said in a voice full of wisdom and caution. “On the other hand, we can afford to be more productive than that. If we keep at least five soldiers under our command we’ll surely be able to manage the army.”</p> <p>That’s what makes my story so charming. I’ll show you what you need to do.</p> <p>He reached under his robe and pulled what looked like a heavy metal mallet out of his shirt and offered it to her. She looked at it tentatively, but took it down. “Would you care to take my name for the document,” she said hopefully.</p> <p>“I would very much love to.”</p> <p>“Now then, will you put your hand on the document?”</p> <p>He did. It was so stiffly and stiffily. She put her hand on it and pressed her palm to the paper and looked at it with a curious smile.</p> <p>“Now, we can begin. Take your shirt off,” he said, his voice commanding. She lifted her arm and unbuttoned the top button of her shirt, then undid the next. She raised her arms slowly, letting the fabric glide downwards, revealing her white bra which she unhooked easily. He had undressed almost to the bone, and was naked under the towel.</p> <p>She was already hard as a rock, which made him shiver. He was already hard. She pressed him gently, but the man was rigid. He didn’t move for a long period of time with his hands clasped inside her shirt as she kissed the bottom of her breasts, his tongue lashing at the nipple.</p> <p>She stopped kissing him and stepped back. There was this big bulge in the young mans groin, but he kept it at semi-erection. She undid his towel, freeing his cock.</p> <p>“It’s wonderful,” she said. Her lips kissed his cockhead, and then went down again, this time with her hands on his thighs. His cock was standing proud, straight and proud. She reached out her mouth and drew it in slowly, her lips dragging it to the back of her mouth, her tongue licking away at the underside of his cock as her head moved up and down his thickening pole. Her hands came back to his stomach. He could feel that her pussy was wet, it would not be a shock to find some moistness there.</p> <p>“My turn, please” he said.</p> <p>“I will do it. Here, now lie down,” she said, and she went to her bag, pulled out her razor and proceeded to shave away the hair around his cock in a few moments. He wasn’t sure what happened to the haircut he had, but when she finished he was a smooth bronze in spite of the sharp edges.</p> <p>She took the blade away from her, then she stood in front of him and spread her legs. He approached her sex, which had the outer lips spread, and rubbed the tip of his cock along it. It looked different than a man’s – there was no hair there, instead a thick strip of curly hair ran down to a low, pointed base. She opened herself to him, inviting a more intimate penetration. Her cunt was wet with anticipation. He pushed the tip of his cock against her hole and he could feel that she was dripping. He pushed gently against her, feeling her warm muscles as they tightened around him.</p> <p>She opened her eyes and looked towards the church that was in the midst of the congregation; everyone was waiting and watching the ceremony. She turned back to him and put the blade on him. He looked back down at her, his eyes telling her that when he saw what she wanted – his face was a picture of ecstasy. He pushed his erection against her, feeling the head slide slowly between her pussy lips. She was tight and hot, just the way he liked it. He pushed again, and the tip of his cock was completely inside it. The Emperor looked as if on a warm, the lips stretched and the fleshy with anticipation. He started to push again, and push a little at the tip started to her again. He pushed again. He heard the entrance to her, and her.
