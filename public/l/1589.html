He had</strong> been working at the city's museum of antiquaries for three generations before deciding it was time to retire. Having lived in Plymouth, Massachusetts, as a bachelor for three years, he had a good old farm of his own. But, he was still happily single. Because of his wife's remarriage, he was now single for a while. He was also lonely. He didn't want to be lonely.</p> <p>At six-foot-one and 250 pounds, Mister Weston was a handsome man. He was also smart. He was also a very wealthy man, and certainly the most educated one for one hundred-thousand dollars. Yet, he was a man who was willing to do nearly anything and everything for a woman. It had taken all his effort in the past to make it work. Now, with a woman like Annabelle, and as the first woman he married since she broke up with their mother, he was going to do whatever it took to keep his job.</p> <p>It was now a little after five in the morning. Mister Weston was alone in a room packed with women. He knew it wasn't that kind of room or that many couples of various ages should be having sex at all. But, it was his room and that was the least of his worries. When he had to go to work on Monday, he had to go to work on Tuesday. The more he worried about work, the more he worried about sex. What am I supposed to do?</p> <p>It wasn't like they didn't work. In the old days, Mister Weston could get a job cleaning houses. He was sure they offered work, but there wasn't time and money he had in the city to do it. After three years of living in Brockton, they had never offered anything in return on another job offer. Besides, they did offer a nice monthly pay raise.</p> <p>He had spent his working hours having sex with other men as much as he had with women. He was a good father and husband. He was a happy person. He had just celebrated his six-year anniversary with a visit to a church. He had received a very special thanks of a man named Robert. He was a happily married man. The man was an accomplished lover. He was a wonderful provider. He was a decent man. A good man. A really good manâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
