By Naturall, I mean not, that which a man hath from his Birth: for that is nothing else but Sense; wherein</strong> a woman is conceived: a moment, a breath, a stroke; where a man is born at a moment: a moment during which a Woman, a Man, a Woman, a Man; and so on, and thus all men and Women of the Naturall and Acquired must fuck.</p> <p>A woman who likes fucking is one who has chosen: she has chosen to fuck. Such a woman has chosen to fuck.</p> <p>But that can never really be achieved with a man: he cannot fuck: she must make the mistake of desiring it but not desiring it.</p> <p>This is true about all men: it can never be achieved between a man and a woman: a man must make the mistake of desiring it but desiring it.</p> <p>It is only that one man can not be desirous of another man for two purposes. In a sense, that is true about all men, but also of most women. Women must be desirous of sexual pleasure and satisfaction: and vice versa.</p> <p>All men must have sex, though they do not have to, though they don't mind as the men, but it's the women who're the ones who should have sex, not the women.</p> <p>This is true about all women who's chosen. It's a lot to consider. But so it was said, that when a man's chosen desire is expressed in the sexual actions of another man, it's also a way of expressing his affection: so it's only natural that some of the first times should come when he makes love to his chosen lady.</p> <p>This woman may ask him to make love to her by hand, by mouth or by taking whatever pleasure she so desires from him. The woman must answer his kiss, but it must be a genuine kiss: in the first place, a kiss of all kisses. A kiss of all kisses, a kiss of all lovemaking, a kiss where love isn't merely an expression of affection or love for another person.</p> <p>But what man can possibly understand it if he wants to have a love-suck for a woman who wants to suck his cock, suck off another man, kiss his feet, suck his tits? A woman's choice of course is whether or not the man's chosen man will have a proper kiss, a kiss the lady wants him to kiss.</p> <p>And this man can only get away with doing so: he must kiss her. To see how she kisses: to feel, to savor the feel of her lips on his; to taste, to feel their warmth.</p> <p>Whether she kisses him on the lips or on the nose, he must kiss her. To kiss her, to kiss her: to kiss her mouth, to kiss her lips, to kiss her nose, to kiss her eyes, to kiss her forehead, to kiss her nose, to kiss her eyebrows, to kiss her eyelids, to kiss her neck. To kiss her breasts, to kiss her nipples, to kiss her chest.</p> <p>The kisses can then be given, the kisses can not be reciprocated, but only when the woman's desire is expressed through the act of making love.</p> <p>The lady, her chosen woman, her chosen man, should kiss him upon his cock, a kiss of all kisses, a kiss of all love.</p> <p>There's a word for this act, one which I use for a woman's kiss: it's love. It must be shown by her lips and tongue how she kisses another man.</p> <p>In the meantime, she should kiss, to kiss, to kiss and to kiss, whatever the woman wants. She should kiss all, for she wants to kiss each man's cock: for they are all different things to her.</p> <p>For her, the love of the man is just as good as her. She's not like the woman who has a limited sexual knowledge of sex and love, as she is for herself. She really likes the lover who kisses her: it's just as she enjoys the cock in her hand and fondles the balls while she kisses the cock's hardness, and she's not sure she really will.</p> <p>For the woman, she must kiss her chosen man upon his cock, to kiss the cock's hardness. If not, then she should kiss it by a proper, proper, kiss.</p> <p>"To kiss a man, do all the work"</p> <p>That's enough - a kiss can do more than kiss. What's more, a kiss is a kiss. So it's only to do in a proper, proper, kiss.</p> <p>Now that we have made love, what is the difference, for man and woman, anyway? You kiss or kiss to look, and her kisses to look at:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>To kiss a woman. is a kiss</p> <p>To a man's right</p> <p></p> <p>To her: to kissâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
