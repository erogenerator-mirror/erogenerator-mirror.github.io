There was little else their duty could have demanded. * * “This won't make war”, said Kutúzov. “This is good. It is good. I like the work.” Tanya was sitting down, feeling very smug. She had found her love. Kutúzov, who had been her captor before, had also felt some comfort. “What can't be done, does anyone,” she said. “You mean this,” said Kutúzov, as he unzipped his pants. “That is what I want, isn’t it? This is what I want!” “This is what you get out of these lies”, Tanya told him.</p> <p>“I would like it if you were my lover,” Kutúzov said. “This is what I want. And if you were my lover, I would do anything to have you.” “You just can’t say that, Kutàzov!” Tanya said, getting up to slap him again, but Kutêsov just leaned back and puffed his chest out, in a way that Tanya thought he was enjoying the show! Tanya was still in the mood to tease him, even if Kutúzov didn’t know it. And when he got out of the chair, Tanya told him that he had to go to the next room. She then began to think about what she wanted him to do to her. She thought about getting herself off, but Kutúzov had made her come. There was no use denying his feelings. She got up, walked to Kutúzov, and grabbed him and began to suck on him. It didn’t take long for the man to come in her mouth. Tanya liked to swallow the man’s cum. She swallowed every last drop.</p> <p>Tanya stood up and left, saying, “I'm outta here.”</p> <p>She walked out and looked into her window. No, more like, “The next bedroom upstairs.” She thought to herself. She would take up that bedroom again tomorrow.</p> <p>Tanya returned to her chambers. She didn’t like how she looked. She looked at her clothes. She liked what she saw, not the clothes in the clothes department.</p> <p>“You might want to try them out yourself”, Tanya's mother said to Tanya.</p> <p>“I'm ready” Tanya said. She was ready for work!</p> <p>They were going to get some more work tomorrow, Tanya thought to herself.</p> <p>The END—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
