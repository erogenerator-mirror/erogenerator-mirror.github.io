She had to cover up one hand from my other arm with her blouse.</p> <p>"Ahem, if you can stand, I'd like to say hi."</p> <p>"Of course, d'you know that is not an invitation?"</p> <p>"Yes, and your son," she said, her lips parting to show what she had in mind.</p> <p>"Of course it is," I agreed, and reached out my hand to the back of her hand.</p> <p>She took it and we touched, and as the kiss broke, I felt like I had never experienced before, a feeling that I was not going to stop, if I wanted to make her cum. I kissed her again, and she parted her lips for mine to kiss back, and I felt that she was about to go all the way. My cock got into full erection by the sight of his mommy tongue-fucking me.</p> <p>I felt her tongue-fucking me. God, what was getting into me? I didn't care. I just had to touch this gorgeous creature-mother as she kissed me, and I tried to do just that, but when I felt her hand cup my cock just below the tip, it felt as if it might explode.</p> <p>I reached around her and found her breasts through the thin jacket. Her nipples were stiff and stood out hard, like points of a red telephone handset waiting to be played with in order to get picked up. Her hair was a perfect arrangement on the back of her head, she was wearing a bright-red cap, and her bangs made her eyes pop a bit.</p> <p>I leaned closer to her and kissed her again. And we did it. It was as if we were on our way to a sex show at the theatre. I took her lips between mine, and she parted them, and I kissed her neck. Her breasts felt warm as I did just that. She shivered and her lips went from my neck to my earlobe.</p> <p>"I'm hot for you, my boy," she whispered, as she turned slightly and put her cheek on mine.</p> <p>I put my hand on her ass and squeezed the firm roundness of it. It was warm, smooth, and smooth. I was ready to get inside her. My cock was up and out of the leg of my jeans like it was on fire, but I put my hands on her waist where I could feel that she might not mind.</p> <p>"Do you like what we have here?" I asked, as I got down on my knees to her right and took her right breast in my mouth. She lifted her skirt a bit on the sofa, exposing her left leg. I kissed up the inside of her thigh as I ran my fingers up to the hem of her skirt. She moved her right leg a bit, spreading it to give my hand easier access to her soft pink pussy.</p> <p>"Mmmm," she said in what sounded like a moan. "Just...just touch me there...," she panted, as she raised her skirt all the way to just above her knees, and let me run my fingers up to the juncture between her thighs.</p> <p>I spread her lips and felt warm pussy juices coming out. She was wet, and her juices were dripping out with a look of excitement. I touched her clitoris with my middle finger.</p> <p>"Yes," she whispered. "I love it when a boy touches me there."</p> <p>It's a wonder she didn't say, or ask me not to go down on her. My cock stiffened up in an instant.</p> <p>"Hmmm, no touching me there. Just touching it," she urged me. I pushed her back on the sofa and she spread her legs. I looked into her eyes, but I was in no hurry to get up and get in between her legs. My mind was on what she just said, and I moved my body to slide my throbbing cock into her pussy-hole.</p> <p>"Oh, yes!" she groaned, and I felt a jolt of electricity through it into my brain. "Fuck me, lover! Fuck me!"</p> <p>I didn't hold back. I just drove forward, driving my cock straight into her pussy as she gasped. It was heavenly. As she pushed her groin up and down on it, her tits were swaying, I'm sure we were making music in our chest-plucking.</p> <p>When I pushed into her pussy full, I felt that she might get an orgasm, but she didn't. Her eyes never left mine when she spoke or looked down. She just kept kissing my face and kissing me with her lips. When she said, "oh...my boy that!" I got a guy's my guy there!" her it's so nice to make me," she said it's so I said, I said I made aâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
