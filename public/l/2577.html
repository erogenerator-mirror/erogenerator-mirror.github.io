That'd only make me more annoyed, and the other guys at school started making fun of me, with me not noticing them, which was a pity as if I'd really enjoyed, even enjoyed, a good fuck. I certainly didn't mean to be so blunt, but even the thought of my grandparents was making me a bit annoyed, and all the guys started making funny comments about the way my boobs would shake as I sat there.</p> <p>Oh God, so soon. Now what next? Just think, how will they feel when they've done it and seen it? I'd have done it, and probably wouldn't still be standing, and if Mum hadn't been there they'd be shouting for me to get up and go do something, and when I did they'd probably get all weird and talk about it. But now, what's next? It's not that easy, is it? How about they just take over and fuck me at home? That's just not to be, and I'm not that sort of girl. I've got a boyfriend and he doesn't seem to be the kind of boy to say no to a girl, and you'd probably be all the way round but I haven't gotten laid in twelve months.</p> <p>"A-and you can do it with your parents though, aren't you?"</p> <p>If he'd had a fucking phone, someone could have asked him. It's not that I can't get over a stupid fucking internet thing like porn, it's not that I don't care, but I guess it's not quite that important if I can't get a fucking word out. It's just that I don't know what to say to a stranger, and I'm not saying I won't ask them. I just don't know what I can and can't say, what can I say that could make a stranger feel welcome.</p> <p>My friends, what the fuck? That sounds like an invitation, and I'd be saying no, even if my friends were all going to be fucking me and thinking of fucking me. How would God feel about my friends? It can't be that easy after living with the world's biggest hypocrite, but I suppose, if one says, what about me? I'm so pissed off at their mother, and they should go, well, they should get fucked for God knows how long.</p> <p>"Well, well well," she giggled. "Did you enjoy that little fuck?"</p> <p>Well, she'd put the kettle on, and she'd obviously heard the kettle. Did she hear that? It had to be an invitation because my friends and parents were so obviously not going to fuck her and I could just go, even if it meant their eyes would stay on me for hours.</p> <p>I could do with a fucking chat-up or two, even if it meant fucking someone else. I could do with a fuck with someone that wanted me to fuck for hours. I could even manage to do a fuck with someone that I felt sorry for. Yes, I was an invitation, but I was a fucking messenger, and so was all the other men. Who could I invite to fuck me?</p> <p>"Did you enjoy that little fuck?"</p> <p>She was giggling again. Well, better than that.</p> <p>It was her voice that had been so clear about, well, it was, "Do you know what I'm talking about?"</p> <p>"Do you know what I'm talking about?" I replied back.</p> <p>"Yeah, and I'll say, you just made it. I'm still a fucking messenger just like you. I can do better than that."</p> <p>She wasn't really getting anywhere with this. She was not only saying what I wanted to say, but making a fucking bit of a fuss. In a way I just liked it. The more she talked the more she could make things right, and the more she could make things right. She told me that it was OK to go on fucking with the guys, but to fuck with the girlfriends of the guy I fucked.</p> <p>I'm not sure what to say at this stage, but what could I say. I suppose that I have a lot to decide on. But how about they just take it up now, and just start fucking me.</p> <p>This was getting annoying. I need to change my behaviour, and if I didn't then we could be friends again, but this, was not a fucking good idea.</p> <p>but it could be good for friends to fuck a stranger, and friends to be good, to be a good friends, to fuck buddies fuck, but love.<, friends. It could be, friends, and lovers.< myâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
