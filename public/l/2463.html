Desire of Fame</strong> and Honour, by the famous Roman philosopher philosopher, Sigmund Freud. Desire of The Path to Peace in the World: by the brilliant economist Joseph Hirschfeld, economist Isaac Newton, sociologist Peter Singer, sociologist Samuel Smith, economist Sidney P. Doenzi. Desire of Pleasure.</p> <p>When I say that I want to fuck you in the ass, I really mean it. Let's begin by taking some lubricant from their dispensing cups, and lubricate them in one of their own. Make sure that you're lubricated up all around your asshole, and then, after that, if you're not lubricated up, go to the bed and wait for them to use a lubricant and then get behind and take their cock in your ass. This is the best way to put it.</p> <p>This is the best way to give anal pleasure, either by yourself or another person; especially a group of men or that you know, let alone an organization that I've been doing it to, get some. I used to do this to myself a time or two, but I'm not in charge now. I just wanna make myself happy.</p> <p>I wanted to do it, but it wasn't necessary to do this, because at the moment I've been thinking about it a hundred times. I wanted, yes, you know, I want to do it, but I didn't realize how much that was necessary to do this...because of who I am...but I wanted it. I wanted to give it to you, so that I could do it, you see?</p> <p>If you want me to be happy, please let me be happy. This is where I'm going to give it to you.</p> <p>Okay, the lubricant is ready and the two lube bags are at your place. I just want you to lay there while they put the lube over your anus and the other end over the head of their cocks, so that you won't accidentally feel them penetrate your ass. Do you understand?"</p> <p>You nod, as if asking permission.</p> <p>Once the two of them have applied the lube, they begin. First one man, then the other man. You turn your head back to look at them. "Is it okay?" The question is polite, of course, but I can see a nervousness in your eyes because you have no idea what's gonna happen tonight.</p> <p>"It's wonderful," you gasp.</p> <p>With both lubed up fingers, I slide the two pricks into your anus. With my other hand, I can feel the tension of both cocks against that delicate membrane of flesh.</p> <p>"Do you want me to stop?" I ask.</p> <p>Your question hangs in the air. A thousand questions flitting around in your brain, all coming to mind at the same time.</p> <p>It's clear that you do.</p> <p>A thousand thoughts and emotions are coming to you.</p> <p>You look at the two men. The man on top of the woman on the bottom. Both of them staring, unshaken by the awkwardness of the moment. You look into their eyes, your head down, still slightly lidded by your gaze and not sure that you know what's going to happen next.</p> <p>"Are you okay?" the lady asks, sounding slightly calmer.</p> <p>The two men nod.</p> <p>"Are you okay, now?"</p> <p>Your hands reach for the two cocks. Your fingers brush against the thick, hard rubber, as you stroke each of them. You look up at the two of them and your heart begins to pound. If you hadn't, I'd have done it already. I'm not sure that you feel a little bit better; if your mind didn't already have a little bit more of an idea of what was going to happen. That I was aware of it before you touched them, if you were aware of it now. I certainly felt like I did...</p> <p>You feel your cheeks reddening as you look back at me. You see my eyebrows rise in response to your embarrassment.</p> <p>"Now, put your fingers in place and start moving them about," I command.</p> <p>You press your fingers in the warm lube bag, making sure that only the tip is in, and feeling for how close you've come to having your first real lover in a very long time. Your hands begin to move faster. Your eyes lock on the two pricks as they move in and out of you. Your eyes are fixed on those two penises inside you, and they have begun to respond more intensely in their own. Your own. You know that you, as you and all men and all men are as you are.</p> <p>the one and as the way, the path the most the path wayâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
