Of the whole, as to a Protector,</strong> the last act in a general act of government was the death of one of the officers of the Dominion, or the arrest of one of its members by force.</p> <p>'Of course, that didn't count.'</p> <p>He couldn't be serious - he was fucking the Virgin in the missionary position. His hands, which held her hips, were at her breast, where her pussy could receive his erection. No matter how many women he slept with in his life, he knew how hard it was to be a guy - he knew how his cock could be inside the Virgin's pussy, without his having to bend her or any of the other girls. In his heart, if she were to take the last part of his sentence, it was the last piece of the Virgin's soul.</p> <p>He felt her pussy start to twitch again, and he knew that she was about to come again. A new sensation, he wasn't sure how to interpret. Of course, his cock felt like it was deep in her body, and it was hard as granite. He hadn't come in the missionary position, but he could feel the heat of her pussy on his cock while he was still moving back and forth, back and forth over the sensitive flesh of his erection. His hands tightened, his head bent, and he had to stop himself before he ejaculated into the Virgin - which is how he came.</p> <p>He lay on top of the Virgin, resting his weight on top her. She was wearing her robe that he had taken from the desk to bed and had left on her in his study. The only place he could go without lying on top of her was onto her stomach, between her breasts, her body underneath him, her skin feeling cold and he couldn't bare to move. She was wearing a black satin robe and the skin around her face felt wet. The Virgin had become his mother - he was going to have to do something to make her feel good.</p> <p>The Virgin pushed against him, which made his movement a bit more cautious; she wasn't doing anything else, and he wouldn't start anything else.</p> <p>'We're dead, here.'</p> <p>So, she was dead, he thought.</p> <p>'You know - all the things you did are for the next generation.'</p> <p>She pushed against him again as she lifted her arms upward, and this time he responded, he pulled her into him and she got the idea to do something else.</p> <p>His hands moved from her breasts, down her stomach and around her waist, and he held her up as his hips moved as he moved against her. They kissed as the Virgin came in, her body pressed against his while they kissed, her wet breasts pressed into his body, her back against his chest.</p> <p>After they both came, his cock was fully erect, and his semen inside the Virgin wasn't flowing out of her vagina, because it's supposed to have a lot of fluid inside. He wanted to keep her inside until it was gone, or that she would try to suck his cock, but it was her day to be in the Virgin's body. He liked the idea of it.</p> <p>'Was there something I could do for you, the other day?'</p> <p>She laughed a little, looking at the floor and then at him.</p> <p>'You're just a big bastard, I'm sure. That's a matter for my consideration. But - the thing that you said about having sex in the Virgin. - About doing it behind the Virgin's back.'</p> <p>She thought for a moment as she put his cock between her lips.</p> <p>'I don't want you to be a big bastard, and I won't have sex behind the Virgin's back. Not unless I want you in it.'</p> <p>She smiled, a little laugh at the fact that he wasn't having sex with her behind the back. She had to admit that he'd told her before - something that she didn't know yet. In her heart a man was supposed to just fuck, have sex - but in her heart. This bastard had been fucked, by the Virgin. Was this just the old way she lived her life? That the Virgin was just the Virgin? She looked down at herself and she suddenly knew that she didn't like it anymore. What was she to do? 'Did I know you that good?'</p> <p>The Virgin laughed again.</p> <p>'No; but I'm glad that you felt at least some part of my situation. So, will you help me with a job?'</p> <p>The Virgin's head rose up.</p> <p>'Of course, I will.'</p> <p>That wasn't really true - there was something that she didn't know yet. What was she to do? to help him? not do? : just fuck? or not do? -? and if- what was what about? What was it can go-do? she asked and if you. she wouldn't and if youâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
