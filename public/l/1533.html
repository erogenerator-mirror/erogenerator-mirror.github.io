English by Niccolò Machiavelli </h3><h4>CHAPTER XVI — CONCERNING LIBERALITY AND MEANNESS</h4><p><strong>Commencing then with the first of the above-named characteristics, I say that it would be well to be reputed liberal. Nevertheless, liberality exercised in a way that does not bring</strong> the subject further to personal embarrassment. For instance, the idea that it would be appropriate to insert his cock into a well-lubricated vagina would not, as it were, be regarded as a moral imperative, as with many feminists, that this would be appropriate. This would, however, be a matter of personal conduct. If it were of a sexual nature to a man, then, while a well-lubricated vagina might be better than any other place, this was a moral imperative. But to the proles of society it might well be considered to be sexual intercourse—or so it is said.</p> <p>The following was an example of this.</p> <p>"'Oh, yes. Please...oh, yes...'," she said. "Take me in the ass. I really want it!"</p> <p>"Yes, good. Put your finger in there. Make it nice and round so I'm nice and clean!"</p> <p>And it was.</p> <p>"That's it. Put it in me. You want to fuck me with it, you're going to fuck me with the stuff. In the ass!" She was panting with the exertion of it, and I took a mental note of the name - Caine. It was, after all, a 'dirty word' for anal sex, and its meaning was a good one. (I, too, was feeling a little dirty. I had a girlfriend who made me wear a dainty pair of knickers every night.)</p> <p>"I want everything; I want to be fucked with everything in me and in me -- in everyone, everywhere,", she added.</p> <p>"You like anal now," I said. "You're going to suck me off, so you can have my prick in your mouth, if you want to, too."</p> <p>"Of course I want to," she said, without even blushing. In some ways I would like to see her suck me off, to have my prick in her mouth, but I'm not sure I would be able to, well, get it into her. Of course, there was no way that I was going to be able to come in her there either. (There's a lot of room in the kitchen and in the bathrooms in my house; I can even see it.)</p> <p>"But first..."</p> <p>I placed my hand on the small of her back, guiding my manhood to its target. She moved her face down to my groin, and I felt the tip of my penis enter the groove of her anal entrance. "Are you sure you don't want me to have no trouble taking your ass?"</p> <p>"No, of course I want you in there."</p> <p>"Of, of course..."</p> <p>I pushed into her a little harder. She made no sound, or movement. Only a sigh. The sigh ended: "...Oooh..." Her sighs turned into sighs, and became more ragged; she was breathing heavier, and faster. I pushed harder and faster, sliding more of my prick into her rear channel. "Is that what you want? Is that what you've been waiting for?" I said. She turned her face to me: her eyes, her mouth, her tongue, her face. She nodded. "Yes," she said again.</p> <p>I started to withdraw from her pussy. She gave me a look over her shoulder, and said "No..."</p> <p>"No? No?"</p> <p>"Yes, yes, absolutely."</p> <p>"Yes," I said.</p> <p>In spite of my desire to fuck her pussy, though my desire was also hers, I hesitated. She asked me to stay still, "Yes," I said, "that's what I want: to fuck you."</p> <p>"No, I mean yes, I don't want you to take my ass."</p> <p>"Yes," I said. She looked at me with surprise, then looked at us and back at my prick, which was fully embedded in her anus. "How would you like to let a man put his dick into your ass?" She was surprised, but said "I don't know, no, not really."</p> <p>"Oh, yes. You don't know, but it's, well, the idea itself." I took her face in my hands and leaned in to kiss her. "Does it still feel that way?"</p> <p>"Mmmmm." Her breath coming in little shudders.</p> <p>"It's too dirty to be fucked there," I said. "Do it."</p> <p>She opened her mouth, and with a slow movement took my prick into her mouth. "Do it," she said, and, when I didn't take it for her, she sucked me into it. It was, it seemed too messy. She was still breathing heavier: not breathing heavier.</p> <p>"Do it still feel that you want to be tight."</p> <p></p> <p>it to feel good—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
