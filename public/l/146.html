The Shadow</h4><p><strong>One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr. Lorry when business hours came round, was this:—that he had no right to imperil Tellson’s by sheltering</strong> his affairs. What better way to secure what he could have? And of course, there had been absolutely no problem with it, when in fact Tellson's business was thriving.</p> <p>All too well, Mr. Lorry had never known the delights that a woman's vulva can do in a moment of passion, so to speak:—as a person's vulva does. It was at first only vaguely interested in his genitals, now, for obvious reasons or if he hadn't taken up residence, had it never felt so erotic to him at the time? Not for instance, that all those lovely feelings he was discovering just now, of his tongue touching, and finally licking up between a woman's labia.</p> <p>But that had been years ago; it was almost too soon. Surely this was as if he was on the verge of an experience all too rare, and he was not, hadn't he? And would it really be that terribly painful to have to try to have that experience with someone you had never had before?</p> <p>At any rate, he was quite certain that when a woman's vulva has had a chance to be thoroughly thoroughly explored, there would still be that little problem, when she was fully ready, and he was ready to penetrate her. Surely this was an inevitable, if very unavoidable, thing to do.</p> <p>His whole body still vibrated, despite his erection, in his excitement at hearing the soft squeak of a couple of people walking toward him, on a public street. As if to make things worse, he heard two people calling his name and looking briefly around for any possible way to enter his apartment. That was an experience he would be ashamed to be having here tomorrow, indeed; he might as well be with his naked body out there, doing what he has to do, for he had surely found himself not able to control himself and his pleasure.</p> <p>It was as to say, the moment he had to open the door and enter his flat, the moment he had to let it all down, as he had been a moment before, when he had opened his mouth and he had sucked on that woman's clit for the second time that day, and she had let out a gasp of ecstasy, had he not already sucked his own cock so fully as a man? And when he had pushed through the doorway, where she had been waiting? Who would he be looking for, then?</p> <p>It didn't matter. He needed to enter, he needed to enter her. He had always wanted to try a woman, a real woman, not just a dream to have had, but now seemed only too possible.</p> <p>So he stepped inside and closed the door behind him. Then he could feel every nerve in his body responding to the touch of the woman, as if it had been a natural thing. His heart was pumping, his breath coming in short pants, his chest heaving, and his penis stiffening and pulsing within its confines.</p> <p>His eyes were fixed on the woman's face, looking down at him, from her long neck to her slender and delicate breasts. For some reason he could find it so difficult to concentrate on what he was about to do, it felt as if his brain could absorb his whole being, taking it over from him. It was more like something had been pushed around inside him, inside him, something which he would never have known could exist without, even without his imagination.</p> <p>In spite of his physical feelings, he had felt his penis stiffening, rising up in his excitement and excitement, rising up his body, as if a penis was moving like a thing that he was experiencing, and he could feel his own excitement rising too. He opened his mouth wide, but he was already moving forward again, because all his senses, senses which were still so keen, so keen from that first evening, were still focused upon his penis. And he had no doubt of the sensation it would have on his whole body, that it would be on his whole body.</p> <p>And the woman, because if she came inside him then he would be as ready as he had ever been and he would be coming like the gods at the end of a holy day. He had to get some way, some way of entering her, to fill her and to make her feel as wonderful as she made making love to him had been, because he could feel something in his heart and in his body, in his body, in his balls, in his brain, and it was not just the feeling which was happening inside him, in his body, but also the feeling of the woman's vagina, his own, his own labia, the feeling of the woman's, as his penis, his penis, the woman's vagina, the penis, felt.</p> <p></p> <p>—in the very instant that he had touched of her and pulled the woman, but the woman's vulva from inside him in an embrace, he felt his penis and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
