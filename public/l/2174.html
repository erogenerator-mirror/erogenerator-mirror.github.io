Socrates was wont to call the common conceits and opinions of men,</h4><p><strong>the common bugbears of the world: the proper terror of silly children.</strong> "Oh you children are evil," she yelled as she reached across the table and pulled me to her.</p> <p>"Don't worry, I won't kill you, little miss angels," she whispered before kissing my cheek.</p> <p>When our lips parted, I reached to her and grabbed her ass cheek. I could feel the warmth of her body through her blouse.</p> <p>"Do you trust me?" I asked as my hand slid down her waistband.</p> <p>"Of course, I trust you," she whispered back.</p> <p>I continued to stroke down her bare ass with one hand while trying to imagine that my finger was between the cheeks of Angelina de Lufidéne.</p> <p>I pulled her close and kissed her again. We made out for a while until we felt light headed, our faces flushed and our breath coming in gasps, our hands working frantically as much as the other's as we could.</p> <p>"Holy shit, you guys aren't mad anymore," Monica moaned into my ear, her hand squeezing my dick firmly.</p> <p>My dick was already hard from our kissing. As I slid back and forth against her ass cheeks, she pressed her tits into my chest. We kept kissing until we were both breathless.</p> <p>"I can believe I'm saying this," she grinned. "I love you. You're the smartest kid I know."</p> <p>"Mmmmhmm," I purred as she slid back into my arms. "But I'm afraid I'll die of a heart attack, will you really die when I touch your heart?"</p> <p>She put her hand behind my neck, pulled me closer and we kissed again. I massaged her tits through her blouse, feeling her nipples hardening against my fingers.</p> <p>"Will you let me touch you?" she asked tentatively.</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess I could let you."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Yes," I answered. "Let me."</p> <p>She nodded and slid her hand inside my trousers, into my briefs. She pushed her hand up inside my underwear, grasped my cock and stroked it. "Mmmm," she moaned. "This might be more fun when I do this."</p> <p>"Yeah," I moaned as she slid my cock out of my briefs and into her hand. Her other hand grabbed my dick and she began stroking it.</p> <p>I watched her as she masturbated me, knowing that she wanted to suck me, so I helped her and lay on the sofa next to her. Our lips still kissing, I began fondling her tit with one hand. I kissed down her chest to the tops of her breasts, where my mouth continued its kisses. I kissed her tits, licking and suckling each one as she stroked my cock faster.</p> <p>I reached between her tits and ran one finger around her nipple as she stroked me. She pushed herself against my finger, moaning with pleasure as my finger brushed her clit. With her other hand she was squeezing her own tits, rolling her nipples in her fingers.</p> <p>She brought me back to reality by pulling my hand to her mouth and kissing me. Our tongues explored each other's mouths as she sucked and licked my tongue. I reached my hand toward the back of her head and squeezed her hair.</p> <p>"Mmmmm," she moaned as my fingers played across her face.</p> <p>"You're going to make me cum," I whispered as I moved my thumb across her cheek. "I'm going to keep touching you until I cum, okay."</p> <p>"Okay," she said seductively before returning to my mouth. "That's it. I want you to cum into my mouth, baby."</p> <p>She rubbed my dick even faster, making me gasp as her fingers tightened around it. I felt the pressure building inside me and knew I wasn't going to last long. I looked down at her as her fingers were still at a feverish pitch. I watched her mouth move faster on my cock, her lips wet against the head, as she continued to rub me. I could feel the semen swelling in my balls and knew that I was about to cum again.</p> <p>"Oh God. I'm right there," I moaned and her mouth felt even wetter as I watched her lips slide up my cock. My hand reached to the back of her head.</p> <p>"Mmmmm," she moaned as her hand jerked me off, coating my fingers in her saliva. "Mmph" escaped from her mouth in a loud sigh.</p> <p>"Oh fuck," I groaned as she continued to gently stroke me.</p> <p>"Mmmhmmm," she repeated as my cock pulsed up to her lips. "Mmmmm, you're my God, you're going to cummmm." . . I can't stop." her mouth tightened around my finger—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
