To quote the great philosopher John Milton... That is the meaning of the Great and the Whole. But, in reality is often wrong. So you might wonder: "I would have to be a Man on Earth: To make love to You and live Life and to Love." But we all do it, we all get to live, we all learn, and we all grow. We all take something. There are many things that we like, there are many things that we won't take away: And there are things we don't. As we're all beginning to see, what's more important is love. What we're all discovering is what God has called a Love Can't Go There. It can't. You can't live without one.
