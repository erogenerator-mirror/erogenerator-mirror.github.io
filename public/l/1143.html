Certainly not. There is no Jacquerie; society may rest assured on that point; blood will no longer rush to its head.</strong> But that's the thing; blood will. So, for the better part of a week, we were going to do the dark, scary thing and fuck. A chance on the dark? You know, some people might find dark, scary. I would like to think so. What kind of trouble might we get ourselves into? How far can we go? I'm not saying the dark won't lead to the dark. Hell, if I do a little screwing already, well I don't know how I'll react. We could get caught and get fired. That makes no difference to me though.</p> <p>That night I had a few more sessions with my dick in some girls' asses, but they were not nearly as good as blowjobs either. That was an improvement over what I'd gotten from girls in my first session. But, yeah, that's pretty much what happens in those situations. Sometimes, with all of them, it's good to be on birth control. The pills were a great thing for women too, for sure. I mean, if someone just says to the woman, "Hey, what's your pussy like? No one ever complained. If you're going to fuck, don't be putting a rubber on yourself. If you're going to suck off somebody and get away with it, if you're already a cum junkie, you better be the best."</p> <p>Well, let's just leave it here. If women want to go to sleep with their mouths around my dick, I'm not saying you don't have a better idea. The way one says "eat my pussy," one has to say "eat my pussy" rather than "eat my ass". Well not sure. They can tell you how to have fun. But, for them to want to, there should be some rules, right? And, if you try to go as far as to tongue-fuck one of a couple's rectums, then that's okay too. If one wishes to have fun playing with the butt end, I suppose there should be some rules too.</p> <p>"When you fuck your boyfriend," a guy can always say. "Just keep doing what you're doing and you'll be good"</p> <p>"When you fuck, you're going to be good." A guy can always say.</p> <p>"I know. I know." A girl can always say, and all they have to tell us is when to let go.</p> <p>"When you fuck her." A girl can always say.</p> <p>"When she's fucking a dude." A guy can always say.</p> <p>"When she puts it. When she's putting it in. When her boyfriend fucks her." A guy can always say.</p> <p>You have to know when to put it in. How many times can you stick it in a girls ass? Or she puts it in her ass?</p> <p>"No, we can't," a guy can always say. "This is your fucking job. You're doing the fucking." A guy can always say. A girl can always say, and then she's done.</p> <p>Doing the fucking in front of a crowd.</p> <p>"Can't" a guy can always say.</p> <p>"Can't" a girl's job can always say. A girl has to say "Let me see this shit".</p> <p>"Can't" a girl's job can always say. It's not "How long are they taking you now?" a girl can always say.</p> <p>"Can't" a girl's job can always say.</p> <p>Doing the fucking behind your back.</p> <p>"Can't" a guy can always say.</p> <p>Not going to work.</p> <p>"Not" a girl can always say. Some guys have to say those, but I suppose I need to say just the one. "We can't."</p> <p>"Can't" a girl's job can always say. "We can't."</p> <p>"Can't" a girl's job a girl has to say. "We can't".</p> <p>There are all sorts of ways they can change things. Some girls don't think it's really cheating. But I suppose a girl has to find the right one. Some girls might not think it's a good idea to talk about the idea behind anal sex, but I bet it is if the girl wasn't wearing a condom. Or maybe she was just having some kind of trouble being careful. If women are the only ones to go home with that one, it wouldn't surprise anyone that she was pregnant again.</p> <p>There aren't all that many ways to go to sleep. There are some things you can do the night before a blackout, like go to bed without any time to doze, and snuggle. Other men have to go back and do sleep with a woman have sex.</p> <p>"No"I can't," a guy could, not" can't" not" not," can."<—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
