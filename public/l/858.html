I now ventured to descend: it was deep dusk; I retired</strong> to my study as the room fell quiet; a man came to my door, knocked three times, and entered. I greeted him.</p> <p>“Honey?” I asked him.</p> <p>“Hi dad.” I greeted him.</p> <p>“Doing really good,” he replied; he was tall and broad-shouldered; he looked good to me.</p> <p>We embraced; as we embraced, I felt his thick fingers wrap themselves around my waist. I smiled, then kissed him. He kissed me again, and we went upstairs. He pushed me down on the bed; he unbuttoned my blouse; his hands were on my bra-covered tits and one of them was there, his thumb rubbing my nipple. Again, I moaned. He pulled off my clothing; I felt his warm mouth on my nipple; his lips sucking it, his tongue flicking it, his fingers were in my cunt as I moaned again. Again, I moaned; I moaned and he kissed me, sucked it; then pulled it out of his mouth and kissed it, then kissed my tits before letting go, and going back to their sweet mass. I moaned into his mouth; I wanted him to move from my mouth to my tits and suck them; I wanted him to fuck me and suck them until I screamed his name! I did so; he got on me as the bed went higher. I was on the bed, looking down at him kneeling above me, his cock looking huge in front of me. I looked up at him, at this monster, which looked so good, so big, so perfect, oh, so fucking long! He looked down at me as I looked at him; as he lifted my head and held it so that it was only one foot wide. His fingers took mine as I held him, he held his cock and I did, I held it, and he did; it was really long, and so big and so beautiful, and so hard and so thick and so fucking big. Then he kissed my lips, and I kissed him again; I kissed the lips to the end of his cock and put my mouth over the end. He tasted good, his saliva was warm, and I licked it up with my tongue, and up to the tip. Then, I licked his balls as I held both and they hung there, so beautiful and so fucking big.</p> <p>“Suck my cock,” he said, “suck my cock,” I did, I sucked and I sucked and I sucked, sucking like a baby getting milk.</p> <p>“Suck it,” he said as I sucked.</p> <p>I did, and I sucked it hard and deep and he groaned as I sucked on the end.</p> <p>“Ahhhhh, yeah, suck it, suck it, suck it,” he groaned loudly and I kissed his balls. He went wild; in spite of the fact that he wanted me to suck his cock,”Suck it for me, suck my fucking cock.” He moaned some more; he was so fucking hard and so hot. The words; the action as I took his whole cock into my mouth. And he sucked on my tits, his cock fucking my mouth; he was moaning and yelling and groaning; he was going to cum, and he was going to cum now. I sucked him, I sucked him, oh, oh, Oh yes, I suck it, owwww! I sucked and he pushed into me, and I sucked and he came! I came! He came like a fucking whale as I squeezed his balls! I sucked and he jerked and I sucked him and he came!</p> <p>He fucked my mouth and I sucked him and we went all the way to heaven. We came, and fucked together, and he came and he came. I had a cock in my mouth and I'd had one in my cunt, and it had been in my cunt.</p> <p>“I want you to fuck me again,” he said so softly and I did.</p> <p>And we did! He fucked me, and I fucked him, and we did. He got on his back, I straddled his legs, his mouth to my cunt, his mouth to my tits.” He was still inside, and he kissed me as I rode his cock up and down, it was hard and it was hard and he took a nipple in his mouth, sucked. In spite of all, my cunt was on fire, and I couldn't stop my orgasm from coming. It was still hot and heavy; he liked it fast; my cunt was in need. I needed.</p> <p>He took my hand from his dick and like a condom, wiped it had fallen asleep. He put it on his cock, I told me to move up.</p> <p>I was not my—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
