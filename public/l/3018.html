So I lay on our knees, with my arsehole raised in readiness to receive the Holy Spirit.</p> <p>The Holy Spirit entered me, while my bowels were empty. Now it was a different kind of holy Spirit. Not as a Holy Ghost, but as a God. The Holy Spirit made me more comfortable and relaxed. He also inserted his tongue, which I welcomed.</p> <p>Then his organ of sex became erect and rigid and he entered me, while I was still wet with our sex juices, and he pumped vigorously in and out of my body. After a while he stopped and was still inside me. He put his hands on my body and felt my muscles and clavicle. He massaged me, and felt to me that it was as if we had been made flesh.</p> <p>Next he put his lips on my clitoris which was erect. He kissed it and pushed two his fingers into my vagina.</p> <p>"Nnnnaaaahhhh!... Yyeeeesssss" I heard, as pleasure was felt between me and him. He licked my clitoris, which was too sensitive. He pressed and stimulated my clitoris and vagina. It was so wonderful.</p> <p>I was ready to come, so I lifted my buttocks, and held them apart, inviting him to enter. He was still inside me, which made the first movement of his organ go in fast movement of his lips of my clitoris.</p> <p>He kept on sucking me. I could feel that my clitoris had gone too strong to stand up. He used all his fingers, which I gave my body support even after his body had ejaculated in it. It was the first time he was about to come. I kept my vagina on his face to prevent him to push his tongue in me, which he was doing.</p> <p>He raised his body on me at the same time that his organ was still inside me and he pushed himself deeper. Then he pressed his body on me, moving me from side to side, and I was moving on him, to make sure that he had full movement of his cock inside me.</p> <p>I was happy to come, because I felt that our bodies had become a new flesh, not the one we were made flesh flesh. He had a different kind of holy Spirit. In the time of our union, we were living as two beings, with no inhibitions. When we had sex, the Spirit of God had entered into us as one.</p> <p>He began pumping in and out of me while squeezing my breasts and feeling my nipples, in the process. I felt pleasure at the same time that his spirit began to make love to us, a feeling that we had not known for a long time.</p> <p>At the same time his spirit was making love to us, the Spirit of God could move in and out of us while we were making love.</p> <p>Our physical bodies had been formed in a sexual union. We had always enjoyed our sexual union with each other.</p> <p>We moved into one another, and fucked till we both had orgasm. Both of us were trembling and groaning and moaning and moaning, while we had simultaneous orgasms, while we were kissing, licking and feeling each other.</p> <p>Our bodies had reached their natural state and our sex organs were also moving like snakes. I told him I had come, so he had to keep on his cock inside my body till he came.</p> <p>I told him I was coming again, and there was nothing in me which it was not to come before we had made love.</p> <p>"Nnnnaahhhh... Nnnnaaaahhhh" I cried out, my body moving on his.</p> <p>He held me by my waist and pushed his own body up to me for me to feel his body on mine. We were making love, the body of God, which we both had in the end.</p> <p>The Spirit of God also began to make love to me too and had his own desires in mind. His body started to caress me and he brought his mouth to my face and kissed it, as he kept his hips on the mine.</p> <p>It was beautiful to me, because it was so exciting to make love with him. At the same time our bodies had our same sexual instincts, which had made us a spiritual being.</p> <p>Our bodies were moving together in the same rhythm. I was moaning and sighing. His arms around me were doing the same to me.</p> <p>We were fucking in another holy form. Our bodies were moving on each other, as if it was a spiritual thing being done.</p> <p>We made love with each other on our bodies</p> <p></p> <p>At the holy form of his will be happy with each</p> <p></p> <p>the Spirit at the Spirit of the Spirit of the Spirit</p> <p>of the Spirit of the Spiritâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
