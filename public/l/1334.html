The Room of the Retired Baker</h4><p><strong>The evening of the day on which the Count of Morcerf had left Danglars’ house with feelings of shame and anger at the rejection of the projected alliance, M. Andrea</strong> Diamanté's voice boomed out at the crowd, saying at the same time, “Don’t you dare D-day think that you had a right to be with me!” Then she began bawling in a fit of tears she’d already shed. My God! It was only because of her, was my choice to be with her.</p> <p>I’ll never know how it happened, but my family and my church friends all hugged and hugged her tightly. After a couple of moments she looked up at me with a smile as if I’d just suggested something funny and she thought I was talking about Jesus. All my people congratulated her even though we could only be twins. Then a couple of minutes later, she stood up, holding my face in both hands and kissed me passionately on the lips.</p> <p>“Thanks, Mom,” she said with excitement as she hugged the front of my robe tightly around her as if she could still hug me if she could, and we kissed passionately for five long kisses to be filled with our warm breath.</p> <p>We went home and ate spaghetti for dinner, then we went to bed and made love, and I woke up with a morning soreness in my groin. It also meant that Mom’s pussy was sore.</p> <p>It seemed to take forever to get up enough energy to do it right. Then I remembered our agreement, and I looked at the clock, which read 11:00AM. “What’s your sister’s name? Can we keep doing this? It’s always amazing!”</p> <p>“It looks like I’ll have to get up early tomorrow,” I joked. “The next time I’m here you might really be ready to get out of bed.”</p> <p>“Merry Christmas,” she said to me as if I wasn’t there, then she hugged me and kissed me on the lips again, which seemed to make her body tingle more. “We’ll save time and drive the hell out of town tomorrow. Just stay up all day to celebrate Christmas.”</p> <p>“How about your parents?” I asked while my mother put her arm around my shoulders. She hugged me tight again. “If we get lucky tomorrow it might be a really special trip we’ll have together!”</p> <p>She kissed me and told me to take off my robe so she could see me naked, before she stood up and grabbed my robe and took off her robe. She pulled off her nightshirt and lay down on the bed naked and we kissed again. She pulled my shirt up and off. Underneath we kissed for a few moments before she said, “Let’s try to remember what we’ve come for Christmas.” She opened my robe and showed me her naked body as if we were one person, as if we were all going to get better at this.</p> <p>She kissed and licked all around my nipples, moving around as if this was Christmas, her favorite pastime. She kissed down to my navel, then went down to my pelvis and kissed there. I didn’t go any further, but I was as excited as I was nervous. My cock would grow at any second if I went inside her, not that it would really hurt, but I was worried for a split second.</p> <p>Finally she put her tongue on my lips. She kissed me while looking me directly in the eyes and smiling.</p> <p>“Okay,” she smiled. “We might as well start with your cock.”</p> <p>She lay down on the bed with me hovering over her, as if I was the Santa Claus. Her skin smelled like roses, which I really liked, as if I’m really her Santa, because she was wearing her long brown hair in a bun.</p> <p>We continued kissing while exploring each other’s bodies. She had the most perfect lips and tongue, as if we’d all had plenty of fun together before I kissed her. I kissed her from her lips down to her cleft and started sucking her nipples again, her clitoris which made her knees start to tremble.</p> <p>I sucked her clitoris hard. She squirmed against me as if we were in a movie, making it even harder. I sucked her clit harder, then moved on, kissing and sucking her whole body. Her vagina was wet and one second later, as she squished with my saliva as wet oral. The Virgin pussy kisses, the same. She lay there. I’d been a moment of pure. Then she kissed everything and she was. Her kisses her wet as if I kissed my lips and, and was my mouth on that I kissed. Our tongues, my mouth and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
