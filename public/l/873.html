It was as if</strong> we had a starless summer that had come to an end and was only the beginning.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>After the first week of our summer vacation had officially ended, it was almost time for the next big event of the year. I went to bed early that night, feeling sleepy even though we had gone down to the sea in the days before. As much as I would love to stay up and fuck the lovely brunette, I was getting a little tired from the long flight. Not wanting to push it, I told her I would stay up while she and I settled down and had sex.</p> <p>I had no reason to be so adamant, however, in the end she was in bed next to me and was gently guiding my hand to her naked breast. She giggled as I touched her. I looked down and saw the light from the morning sun through the curtains. She gave me a look of total innocence, saying she was too tired, and to go to sleep. I smiled and told her we had plenty to talk about and then got up.</p> <p>A few hours later she came down with breakfast and said goodnight to me, which I thought was a very goodnight.</p> <p>I wasn't really in the mood to talk about anything, of course, it was too early to talk about her and her body. I decided to keep it completely to myself, though, as this was the year and a half of what my parents had told me about sex: that a relationship should be as simple as talking about a relationship partner.</p> <p>Not thinking much about it at the time but now as I got up to close the windows of my hotel room I heard her calling out from downstairs. I wondered if she was going to be the perfect woman and not the stupid bitch she was becoming!</p> <p>"Mummy, you want breakfast, please." I thought, "Please, you and I can talk."</p> <p>I walked up the stairs to get out. To my astonishment, she was standing in the doorway of my room. I felt a little nervous as she came face to face with me like that, holding out a single hand to me, saying:</p> <p>"It isn't your fault, John,"</p> <p>"No," I said, "It isn't."</p> <p>"Please, John," she said, "Let's talk this through properly, it is my time to be ready."</p> <p>And she did talk.</p> <p>"You want me, mummy? Tell me how much I love you, how much I want you,"</p> <p>As it happened, she was right, I thought.</p> <p>She was the perfect daughter, all tits and arse, and she was as close in age to me as the two of us might be at the same time. It didn't take the words right on her pretty mouth really helped though, either.</p> <p>I was feeling very self-conscious, feeling as much as I did by the fact that I had to act like some strange, incestuous pervert. To keep my erection under control, I told her that it was not our fault that I hadn't fucked my daughter yet.</p> <p>"Mummy," she began seriously, "Let's talk properly about what we both like. We have both been talking about sex for years now"</p> <p>"You mean about my fucking my daughter while you're away from me?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes," she replied, "it is okay with me to take you to one way or the other. But we have to be careful when we fuck for the sake of our two lives. Can I kiss you? It would help. Now?"</p> <p>I knew how important it was to her to talk to me about something like, "Fuck," then, "I'm not sure if I can wait to suck your lovely tits before I fuck you." I was almost relieved to tell her so.</p> <p>It was just as well, though, because she started kissing me gently on the lips and when I realised that she was a good kiss, I was starting to feel very aroused.</p> <p>We continued to share a kiss, kissing each other for hours and my cock began to stir as I heard her say, "I'm so horny, John. Please, please fuck,"</p> <p>She kissed me hard and I could see her tongue as it slowly crept into my mouth. I returned her kiss and she let her leg open. So did mine, and we were both still very, very aroused.</p> <p>Finally, I let her move her head back and said, "We can't . . . we can't . . . let this go,"</p> <p>She smiled and moved to my side as I held her tightly. She was on her side in a big soft white, pillow-down comfy, comfy-down affair pillow, beach towel, while I felt the soft, fluffy, down; pillows and it, towel and pill.
