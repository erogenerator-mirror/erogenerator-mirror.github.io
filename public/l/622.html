He was conscious of an aloofness from everything earthly</strong>. In his mind, he could only make it possible for him to feel. But there was nothing else that he could do.</p> <p>In his mind, it was like an electrical current going around his body. He could not believe he'd gone through the whole process of seeing himself like this instead of in a mirror. It was like the experience of walking upon a beach. He would be back in a sea of people holding hands, enjoying themselves.</p> <p>In his mind, his body had begun to get hot. His fingers moved down towards his groin area. The sensation was intense at first, but then it became easier as his own body started feeling the same feeling too, as if the electricity had just been released inside of him. In his dream he thought it would never last.</p> <p>For the moment, he wanted to fuck again, as he remembered the wonderful love-making that had followed. It had been so long since he'd made love to his wife. He had had two children to get through, but that was probably just what life was like. With only the slightest of touch, he'd have imagined it really could be that good.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm so glad I got this chance," he said to himself. He had no idea how long he'd been standing there in the doorway to their bedroom.</p> <p>As if he was reading his thoughts, he stood there for a few moments, looking into the open doorframe, then turned to face the mirror as the energy began to move and spread inside of him again, making him feel like he was floating.</p> <p>Suddenly, he felt as if he too were floating, and he felt that he could be floating forever.</p> <p>"Oh, God!" he shouted, his cock expanding to it's maximum size, ready to go again. It was throbbing against his body like the last orgasm he'd experienced.</p> <p>"Holy fucking shit!" he yelled again, feeling his orgasm start to reach its peak, and the next sensation that he experienced was as if this would be his last orgasm.</p> <p>The sensation he needed now was to fuck, and in the time it took him before feeling that his cock would never grow to its full potential, he was in pain, the pain of cumming inside his neighbor's house would be excruciating, but he felt it nonetheless.</p> <p>"Oh God yes!" he yelled. "So good!"</p> <p>His cock surged, growing ever faster in response to the pleasure within him, and he couldn't hold the rhythm of it. The pleasure became stronger and more intense, and it was only then he realized that he had his hands around each other's waist, his fingers digging into his shoulders. His orgasm couldn't have been more intense if he'd been wearing clothes, because his cock was pulsing and twitching in his hands, and even his knees were shaking as the orgasm grew.</p> <p>"Holy shit!" he yelled again, pulling away from the mirror to look into it the most. His whole body trembled as he felt the intensity of the orgasm slowly building.</p> <p>"Oh shit, holy shit!" he yelled again, feeling his cock pulsing at first because his entire body had been aching to cum, and then at the sensation of exploding inside of his dream-perfect neighbor's house. That last sensation was enough to send him over the edge.</p> <p>"God damn! Holy fucking shit!" he yelled, feeling as if he was being murdered in his excitement.</p> <p>His mind was going wild in that moment but he wasn't moving, and he didn't have the energy to hold back his climax.</p> <p>"Oh my fucking God!" he said again in that moment. He could feel the semen rising in his balls and he pushed himself closer. "I'm going to cum!"</p> <p>"That's it. I'm almost there," he heard him say as he thrust his erection forward.</p> <p>He felt his cock pulse as he felt a tremendous ejaculation go through him, and as he felt the cum shoot up into his body, he couldn't deny that it felt like he was filling his living room with hot, powerful jism. The feeling was as if he was getting more pleasure from this amazing feeling than he would have ever expected.</p> <p>"Holy fucking fuck!" he yelled one last time, pulling himself up so that he was laying on top of him. As soon as he felt that sensation, he pushed himself up into his bedroom.</p> <p>He took a while, lying in bed, trying to recover from his orgasm with both of them. At that moment, he knew that there was no way that he'd give his cock a break from being inside of his neighbor's house. No way!</p> <p>It had felt great to her. It felt like more than that. It felt like the world was on a whole around him. It made his body felt as if he could have complete happiness.</p> <p></p> <p>"Oh, , I'mâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
