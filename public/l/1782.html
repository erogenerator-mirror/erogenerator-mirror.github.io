HUNCHBACKED, ONE EYED, LAME.</h4><p><strong>Every city during the Middle Ages, and every city in France down to the time of Louis XII. had its places of asylum. These sanctuaries, in the midst of the</strong> world to serve as heaven for the most stupid human being, the world is a good thing to me.</p> <p>The last place of his greatest importance to me. I love Paris, although Paris was a good idea at the time.</p> <p>We'd arrived on the second day, as we'd been told to. Our fellow Christian Saints who came down from the gates on the second day, who made us a family out of the gates of our own holy lands. It had been a long day at sea, as we'd traveled from the gates of our own holy lands, down to the gates of Paris. We all disembarked, and were escorted down the street to the Saint Laurent square.</p> <p>We took off our robes and threw them on a chair, which we then set our luggage on the ground. I was told to put on a dress which would reveal my white underwear underneath, and that I must remove my undergarments so the men would be able to see my naked body. I took off my clothes, and stood in my panties and bra in the mirror. I removed my underwear, I then put down my panties, and walked upstairs. Inside I was told to put on a light white top and skirt. I put these on, I placed these on, and put these on.</p> <p>A young male priest who was standing nearby, his eyes glued to me, said:</p> <p>"The sight of your naked, white body makes me so excited. There's a man there who will lust for you. I will love you for your skin, your eyes, your skin. I will love you forever. He is your friend, his name is Francis. As for the clothes, don't you feel free to have one on with your body, so long as you put them on for him."</p> <p>When everybody had all gathered around me, I started to get out of my clothes, and everyone applauded. In one moment I was in front of my audience, and my naked body was on display for all to see. Then I was handed my robe, and the man who spoke to me left to be escorted by an apron.</p> <p>To be continuedâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
