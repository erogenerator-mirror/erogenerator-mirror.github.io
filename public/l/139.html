A Plea</h4><p><strong>When the newly-married pair came home, the first person who appeared, to offer his congratulations, was Sydney Carton. They had not been at home many hours, when he presented himself.</strong> They were still in the living room, talking and talking. They had both been naked under their robes.</p> <p>"Now to bed," she said, pulling off her robe. By now they were asleep. He had done well. They had done well. There wasn't any need for her to go out. He hadn't yet slept alone. He'd have to wait for her to be ready.</p> <p>She undid his tie. He didn't resist as she undid the top button of his white shirt. She slowly undid several buttons. He wanted her to undress him. He wanted her to undress him. He wanted to put his hands on her beautiful, young body. Her dark skin and dark hair, that had been so close to his, were now a lovely soft light color on his pale skin. His cock swelled as she unbuttoned his shirt and removed it.</p> <p>She smiled and dropped the shirt, leaving him half clothed but completely naked. She knelt before him, taking him in her hand and slowly running her tongue up the underside of his cock. His face contorted. He tried to pull away but the robe held him still. Her tongue wrapped itself around his cock.</p> <p>"My beautiful husband," she whispered as she stroked her hand up and down his erection. His hips thrust against her. She wanted him. She needed him.</p> <p>"Get up here on the sofa. I want you from behind," she said, as if he had asked her to. She moved in front of him and dropped to her knees. She moved her hands to his hips and pulled them apart. He couldn't hold back his groan. Her tongue swirled around his head. His hands tangled in her hair as his hips thrust against her face. She had never let anyone down there. It was her way. She'd done plenty.</p> <p>She looked up at him from between his legs, as she continued to stroke him. She raised her hand and placed it on his stomach to hold him in. She had him under her control, now. He wanted her. She looked him in the eyes as her tongue licked him from the base to the tip. When she got to the head, her tongue glided down her husband's shaft. He groaned. She looked up. She sucked him into her mouth and held him as she licked him from the base to the head, licking at him with her tongue. She opened her mouth, her hand stroking his shaft. "Mmmmmm." His moans were growing.</p> <p>She lowered herself to take him deep. And she could swallow him. His hands were in her hair. Her lips and tongue moved with him. She held him until she felt him swell and then she moved back to his hand. He pulled her into him and she felt the cum in her vagina. He moved his thumb across her clit. She moved her hips. His finger moved to the small spot under her belly. "Mmmmmm." She moved her ass as she felt his finger begin to press against her anus. She gasped. His finger moved lower and entered her mouth, pushing deep into the back of her throat. She swallowed.</p> <p>As she moved her head, he moved his finger in and out. His hips thrust.</p> <p>When he couldn't stand anymore she began to suck him again. Her mouth moved faster. His hands clenched at her head. His hips thrust. She felt his cock swell. She lifted one leg onto the sofa so he could hold both her hands above her, as his cock thrust faster and faster in her mouth.</p> <p>She was taking him down her throat. His hands held her as he pulled her closer, until he could feel his pubic hair pressing against her nose. He wanted to stay there for some time yet he didn't want to come up from her throat. "Suck me. Suck me!"</p> <p>His hips thrust against her lips. She moved her mouth and fingers. He felt her mouth swallow his cock. He moved his hand to her face, pulling her head hard against him, fucking her throat. His hips thrust. His cock swelled. He could feel himself cumming in her mouth. His body stiffened. It was a climax of epic proportions. She could feel it as she held on as his cock exploded into her throat. "AHHHHGGHH!"</p> <p>He felt as if the universe was on top of him, in front of his eyes, as he gasped and groaned. Some of his sperm leaked from her mouth and onto his cockhead. Her face looked satisfied, happy.</p> <p>As he came down from his peak, Sydney stood up. He could feel his juices running out of her thighs. His legs were shaking. They had not stopped moving. Her face was back to his cock and his cock, but hers.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"You did you are the good."</p> <p>She was goodâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
