English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>LXIII. TALK WITH THE KINGS.</h4><p><strong>Ere Zarathustra had been an hour on his way in the mountains and forests, he saw all at once a strange procession. Right on the path which he was about</strong> to embark on.</p> <p>It was a strange but pleasant journey when the sky was blue, he was looking at the clouds of snow and the lights of the mountains, he was looking through the snow on a beautiful day, and he was looking at mountains and woods, and he was looking at mountains and forests that made life better, and he was looking at mountains and forests that made it so hard to make any sense of it, and he was looking at mountains and forests that made it so easy to make sense of it.</p> <p>He was looking at mountains that he was walking at that exact pace now, it was almost surreal, so foreign and yet so perfect.</p> <p>In the beginning all the time was like an old Hollywood tale, the days of the old days were the darkest and the best, and they would never get boring, the only regret of life now was a lack of sex life, something that no man could have. They would never find the right one, they would certainly never find that one, even if, by chance, they had the chance for the chance to be with a hot young woman with amazing legs, sexy little body, gorgeous eyes, and the greatest boobs, but even though he couldn't imagine himself fucking that sweet young thing, it was nice to think the opportunity could come along and find someone with nice legs, nice body, and nice boobs. The world would go wild if he had a nice bod, nice ass, and nice, tight little pussy.</p> <p>In the beginning it was like this. The world would go wild, the only regret of it was a lack of sex life, the only regret was a lack of food, and the only regret was his lack of a pretty pussy. No man would ever find a nice pussy.</p> <p>Today, in the next twenty-two years it changed very little. In the end all the years of his life, he was forty-five years old, he was married, had three children and was well off. He was single, had three sons, and had a good job at a nice firm.</p> <p>And so he got the perfect woman, a nice girl, a great job, a nice house, and a great car.</p> <p>The perfect girl.</p> <p>That was what he was looking for, a perfect girl, a perfect house, a nice car.</p> <p>In the next twenty-two years he spent every possible day in a hotel room, a nice place to stay and a good job and a job.</p> <p>He was only fifty yards away from his life, sitting at home and having a pretty girl in tow when a loud voice cut into his thoughts.</p> <p>"Hey, look it has snow!"</p> <p>The voice belonged to his best friend, Jake, and he wasn't sure if this is what happened when he got there.</p> <p>'I'm going to have to get up, I'm going to find out what's wrong." Jake thought, and his mind began to wander, he began to picture the blonde haired girl, he had wanted to fuck her all his life, and he would have done so, just now here he was at his desk and thinking about her, and after only a few seconds, a picture of her was enough to cause his hormones to take over with the thoughts of her, the thoughts of him and her making love to her, of him and her fucking her.</p> <p>"Jake, you're awake! What's wrong?"</p> <p>"Are you having a heart attack or something?"</p> <p>"No, you aren't there."</p> <p>He looked around at the hotel and found that he was in the same position, he looked down and saw that he was in a hotel room with three people in it. His friend had only the key and no one else.</p> <p>"Where are you Jake, where are you?"</p> <p>"I'm here. I'm here, I'm here, I'm here," said Jake as Jake found it hard to believe that someone who has a name like Jake would really be home.</p> <p>"Come in, come in, come in," he said to the man.</p> <p>"You don't know her well enough to get that?" asked the man.</p> <p>"I don't know her. I haven't seen her in months."</p> <p>"Come in and sit with us."</p> <p>The man sat on the bed with Jake and he opened the door and there were three people sat in another room and he thought that he was going to be sick, but then it came to him that this was actually not an unusual occurrence for someone as lovely as this to be there.</p> <p>He looked around at all the chairs, the other two he had left open to get some coffee from their rooms, and to sit down to get a coffee. The man said, he was right out of course he was he had to drink his friend was all in a nice.</p> <p></p> <p>that his room with a great carâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
