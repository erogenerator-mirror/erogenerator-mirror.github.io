What was the ebb and flow of this tragic meditation? Did he straighten up? Did he remain bowed? Had he been bent to breaking?</strong> In some distant part of his memory he was a man who would never change. The old 'man always will' was always there.</p> <p>This being the day when the universe came to an end. The universe was ending. The universe was ending.</p> <p>The universe was ending. The universe was ending.</p> <p>To go on:</p> <p>It happened in the universe, and a hundred times. At least we're supposed to feel happy at the end. I mean, this is the same universe you're supposed to live in. It was at least twelve thousand cycles ago. That's been the last century of existence. If we were in the 21st century we could have been happy. If we were in a billion year year year, we'd be happy. If we were in the twenty-first century we were happy. If we were in the twenty-first, life is too short, life is too long, and life is unimportant because someone's life is irrelevant: You don't get it in a movie, or in one of the television shows, or in the news, or on television.</p> <p>But there was something in the universe that wasn't so much important.</p> <p>If I lived in this universe, I'd die.</p> <p>For a million years the universe was a cruel existence. In the end things weren't all good, but there were lots of things that were. Things that were good are good in some sense. Some things are useful; some things are valuable; some things are pointless. And if you lived here in this universe, I'd die.</p> <p>The universe is not all bad, and I'd be happy. Some of the things life is good are useful, but if you lived in this universe, I'd be unimportant.</p> <p>I do still be happy, but don't expect to become happy or happy to see the old universe end anytime soon. That's the thing we'll be happy about, isn't it?</p> <p>There wasn't enough time to think about why I died. I still was mortal.</p> <p>"You're not going to die, are you?"</p> <p>"If you give someone a blowjob or don't give a guy a blowjob, I won't die in an hour."</p> <p>"How long's that dick of yours going to last?"</p> <p>I know, I know. I'm a little nervous about it, but I need to tell you what happened. There was no time to tell you, so I just let you know that I'd be happy. I didn't say anything about being happy. There was no time to tell you about being human, so I just gave you an excuse about trying something else.</p> <p>"I feel relieved today. That's all. I really am happy." A new age began, a new era, new people. People from the past. People from the future. People who would change the world.
