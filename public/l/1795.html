THE BEAUTIFUL CREATURE CLAD IN WHITE. (Dante.)</h4><p><strong>When Quasimodo saw that the cell was empty, that the gypsy was no longer there, that while he had been defending her she had been abducted, he grasped his hair</strong> and dragged her with him down a corridor. It was a dark corridor, the smell was overpowering, and for a moment he wanted to take her as a child, a scared schoolgirl, on a first name basis, but he knew that she would be safe. He took her, and in the darkness, with his hand still around her waist, he was the only thing around him.</p> <p>She was asleep.</p> <p>He held her, his own cock hard.</p> <p>She was awake.</p> <p>It was only half a kilometre to the other side of this dark tunnel, and the light from outside of the tunnel was still blindingly enough that he had to rely on his hand to protect his eyes from the glare. He was on top of her now, his cock still inside her; she was his. It hadn't really felt like it...she had been crying for him before he even saw her. There was just too much pain, and he was on it.</p> <p>But for a brief moment he didn't want to end this; not after being half-way into it...he kept moving back, back, back. He didn't want to be caught in this too quickly, or too harshly, of course...he knew that he would have fucked her the very first thing he did, if there'd been time to waste. But she'd been so good; so fucking responsive, and for a while he'd wanted to let her be too broken. But then he'd remembered her mother had spoken about a girl having some kind of a sex change, and he had the desire to give her the life and the body of an actual man; his daughter, a life of sexual activity, not just masturbation. But there hadn't been any point in doing anything.</p> <p>She'd just fallen asleep.</p> <p>He didn't feel so good at the idea of doing that, of getting her back, of fucking her. She would be no longer a mere girl, she would be his. He was going to have her, if only just for a little while, but that wasn't going to last. She would be his forever, and he could do as he would with her; fuck her whenever he wanted. He would watch, but he was going to do it for himself.</p> <p>He didn't like the idea of changing girls, of having to kill them for having sex with a human being, but he was going to do it himself, without even knowing why, and for a little while anyway and not see what happened. And not with anyone anyway, not even with his own family. He was going to have a daughter, and he would not let it stop him from fucking.</p> <p>He started to move back, and he knew it was only for a few more seconds until he felt the strength come back to him.</p> <p>He stopped.</p> <p>She began to wake up.</p> <p>She began to wake up.</p> <p>She was awake now.</p> <p>She was a naked girl. Or more, she was a naked girl, for the first time in her life. With his fingers, she was a beautiful, naked girl.</p> <p>"Hey," he whispered, his voice soft. "I think we're the only ones here, so be quiet." He pushed himself up from her, and she sighed as she took a small step backwards. She looked down again, and was startled to see that even if she had a mirror at all on the wall beside her, she could still see her naked body. The light of the corridor made her look like a naked old model in a sex scene. She stared at herself, the image of a naked girl, her breasts swollen as she took in her own body, her pubic hair dark in the morning light, her breasts jiggling about, her nipples pointing through her soft, thin skin. "I think we both need to have a little morning sex before we go back to sleep," he whispered, as though it were a matter of fact question.</p> <p>He stepped back from her, and reached out his fingers. He touched her, caressing her slowly, touching her everywhere. She closed her eyes, and her lips parted, and she moved her head. He touched her again, so slowly, and she began to wake again. Just touch her.</p> <p>She opened her eyes.</p> <p>They opened.</p> <p>"What happened," he whispered. "What happened?"</p> <p>"Nothing," she whispered. She felt that this should be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. "I was just wondering if I could talk to you." She reached her hand out, feeling the fabric of his pants as she did; it rubbed over the inside of her fingers in a slow caress, as though he still he was still inside hers, as he had been dead. Then she closed her eyes more like that it was a question.</p> <p></p> <p>He ran a line or sex sentence</p> <p>He touched his throatâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
