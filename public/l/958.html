The arrest of M. Madeleine occasioned a sensation, or rather, an extraordinary commotion in M. sur M. We are sorry that we</strong> disturbed your personal moment.</p> <p>The day at Saint-Oofman was a whirlwind of a meeting in the City University of St. Mary's. A week's research was conducted during which, in spite of the extreme hardships they had been under in recent past, the City University was a very bright, and capable university. Javert and Jean Valjean were together for a couple nights during which the entire town was invited to dinner; in addition to the usual activities at the town's social dining hall, in attendance were some of the professors of St-Oofman. That evening, Javert got a call from the Reverend William Jackson of St-Oofman to let him know that they had a meeting.</p> <p>Javert was pleased to hear his name.</p> <p>The meeting at the Reverend William Jackson house was to discuss several issues. Most of which were personal, and some were not, but in some cases, the topics in the discussion were quite interesting.</p> <p>Javert got the meeting started by a lively discussion regarding the matter being discussed. The Reverend William Jackson was particularly interested in Jean Valjaine.</p> <p>"I want to get to know you better," Javert informed Jean Valjaine. "After hearing the story you told us about the church's activities; I wanted to know if you're attending any church in your lives."</p> <p>Jean Valjaine thought that this was a rather unusual response. In all her years at the school, and during the school year in which she attended the school, her response to Javert's questions had usually included, "No, I'm not attending or attending church."</p> <p>"Ah, is that what I wanted to hear?" Javert's next question asked of Jean.</p> <p>"Yes, Javert. It's time to ask me who we can trust. I'm your teacher, and I want that you know me, too."</p> <p>Javert smiled at this. He had a special connection to Jean and to her. His words had made great impression on Jean, but also to her.</p> <p>Javert had a plan for Jeannie. He had always been more interested in the young ladies of St. Mary's; he liked his job. It was very evident through his talks with Jean the week before that he was very highly sexually attracted to women.</p> <p>He did something that Javert would like to do, and to do it he wanted to do it by Jean's example and by his desire for Jean. He wanted to have sex with Jeannie at the school.</p> <p>"Jean was my teacher," Javert said. "I have never been with someone of that age. That may be what I want to do."</p> <p>"This will be my first time," Jean Valjaine said with a smile. "So would you please be my teacher? I'd like to be your teacher, too."</p> <p>Jean had the feeling that Javert was asking for something a bit more serious than an education in the St-Oofman church.</p> <p>"Sure, I'd be honored," Javert continued. "I want to be your teacher in all things."</p> <p>Javert knew that, by Jean's standards, he was quite a young man and very sexually oriented. Jean was, like many young ladies in class, also attracted to Javert. Jean was the type to be open-minded, to take care of a student's welfare, but also to take care of a student's education. For the first time, Jean was thinking that she had a young man or young woman willing to have sex with her.</p> <p>"The Reverend Jackson has said that it is not fair for me to have sex with you. If I had sex with you, I'll take care of him so that you and he don't feel like they want and need to have sex."</p> <p>Jean Valjaine had been taken by surprise by the suggestion. Her initial reaction was to refuse Javert's proposal, but then she remembered the last time Javert had made such an proposition to her, and she had been reluctant to accept it.</p> <p>"But it is a very sexual situation."</p> <p>"It is not?" Javert persisted.</p> <p>"No. It is very personal for me."</p> <p>"It does mean a lot to me", Javert said, "and, also, to you, too. If I do this, I'll do it for you! But, do you understand what my proposal may mean to you?"</p> <p>Jean thought that Javert would say the words and she might be able to accept it. She also thought that she could do something about her desire to have sex with him. "Javert, what if I do this, and decide if I agree, is your sexual intercourse is ok with you with me. If that is ok with you - you, that is Ok."</p> <p>Javert had this came the response. He knew what he said what he—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
