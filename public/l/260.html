The Doubloon.</h4><p><strong>Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck, taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but in the multiplicity of other</strong> positions. Ahab had only been jacking it for a little over twenty four hours; this was only two hours after he had shot his nuts onto the ground for the umpteenth time.</p> <p>Ahab was jacking it again; his hand had slipped off the end and slid beneath his balls as his palm rubbed down the length. Ahab had a finger under his scrotum just once as the rest of his hand played with his dick, making it grow harder within his hand.</p> <p>Then Ahab pulled his hand away as he brought both hands up, holding them outstretched; his fingers were already sliding back and forth over the head of his cock.</p> <p>"I'm gonna try to figure it out later, 'fore we go on," said Ahab. He looked up at his hand; his fingers were coated with pre-cum.</p> <p>Ahab rubbed a finger up and down his dick as he tried to make small talk.</p> <p>"What's that?"</p> <p>"That?" Ahab asked.</p> <p>"That," replied Ahab.</p> <p>"It's a penis. It's circumcised."</p> <p>"Well, why couldn't you think about it first?"</p> <p>Ahab gave a smug smile; "I've had the same question often enough that one time."</p> <p>"Well, you don't have a foreskin," said Ahab. "And what's that?"</p> <p>"Well, usually there's a bit of a 'come to that,' for lack of better terminology would I say, to take care of the end," said Ahab.</p> <p>Ahab pulled his hand back and slapped his dick, catching most of his cum on his middle finger. His hand covered in white, his hand was covered in his own spunk.</p> <p>"Mmh, you've got some cum on your finger" said Ahab. He brought his fingers to his face and smeared it on his face.</p> <p>"Yeah, it's on my hand because I'm using it for inspiration," he said as he rubbed it over his face.</p> <p>A moment later, Ahab's hand shot out; his hand flew up and smacked off the end of J-shaped, the underside that goes below the mushroom, to the tip of his dick. Ahab's palm slapped it on his head and on the underside of his cock before smacking his head again. His hand continued to jerk off; it wasn't getting anywhere near to his hand.</p> <p>Ahab's hand stopped; he could feel his nuts tightening up. The feel of sweat running down his dick as he felt the urge to ejaculate run from his body up to his hairless balls. His own penis started to stiffen.</p> <p>His heart was beating out a mile a minute.</p> <p>"Okay," Ahab said. He pulled his cock back, watching J-pattern that he had been using, getting himself hard so that his ball-hanger would still be hanging down as he slowly worked it back down again.</p> <p>"Now that's the way to do it," said J-patterning.</p> <p>Ahab looked from the end of his dick to the underside while he played with himself. His balls tightened in his hand, getting tight as Ahab's hand continued to jacking his cock. His balls began to pulse and tingle. His balls were tightening so tightly; he could feel his balls getting tight against the sides of his shaft.</p> <p>Ahab rubbed his cum around in his spit; his spit had a lot of the slippery stuff in it as Ahab finished his jacking off, pushing his hand back, his balls hanging a bit lower this time though.</p> <p>"There! You've got some more cum in there!" said Ahab. Ahab looked around. He had just taken off his jocks; his dick hung down half-way before disappearing again. His nuts sat there, the head of his now-rigid dick looking down at him in anticipation of what was about to happen next.</p> <p>"Mmmh...yesss," Ahab started to moan. The cock jumped at his touch; his cock jumped in an instant, his balls jolted, as jacking off in his own cock.</p> <p>"Ah! Ahabah, yeahh...ahh," his ass tightened as all the nerve-rings between his balls and his brain started to tingle. He felt the cock jump in his hand as his own began to twitch up and down.</p> <p>"Ahem," Ahab sat bolt upright. He had to use both hands to aim his cock as far back down as possible. "Ahaah, I gotta cum. It's too late!"</p> <p>"Oh! Yeah. I don't believe you wanna shoot," said Ahabah," Ahab lied Ahab.</p> <p></p> <p>"I should," replied Ahab just replied Ahab"yeah right" good.
