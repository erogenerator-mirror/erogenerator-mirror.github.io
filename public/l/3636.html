All possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed to be entirely taken from me; and I firmly believe that</strong> if that is all that makes life better.</p> <p>At the moment I was still trying to catch up with my mom, as she had been all packed up and ready to go, so to speak. I was still so nervous about being alone with her, and I knew my mom already knew what happened. So now just to get a couple of things straight, I asked her, "May I offer you something to drink?"</p> <p>Instead of asking for water, Mom immediately replied, "Yes! I'll have a glass of lemonade!"</p> <p>I just shook my head in disbelief that a glass of lemonade was one of the greatest things in the world to me.</p> <p>After a few seconds, I decided to give mom the glass of lemonade and then take some time to think. I decided to go for it.</p> <p>After pouring both glasses of water into them, I walked back in and sat down opposite my mother. I placed one hand on Mom's bare knee, then gently pressed it towards her lap. I smiled, looked over her shoulder and watched as my fingers gently parted her legs. I sat down slowly. I gently opened her leg a tad. Mom instinctively tried to close her legs, but couldn't do anything.</p> <p>I thought with a grin, "Maybe one day I'll be able to give her the foot massage...you know how I hate the feet."</p> <p>Mom looked a little embarrassed, a little afraid. "That's very funny, you perv," she said.</p> <p>"I was just wondering," I smirked.</p> <p>Mom's reaction was obvious, the same as mine, and my expression must have clearly implied her fear. Mom slowly opened her legs a bit further.</p> <p>I started in with a slow move, but then got faster as my hand went in under her right thigh. Mom quickly wrapped her legs around the top of my hand. I could feel from her tone that she was liking what I was doing.</p> <p>My smile grew a bit brighter at Mom's reaction. I continued, "I know about the foot massage", so to speak. My smile was now bigger as I said, "I could show you just how well my hands do."</p> <p>"Well, please go ahead." Mom pleaded.</p> <p>"Certainly, but I'm sorry to have made you uncomfortable," I said.</p> <p>My answer was a loud groan in her mouth. "You are such a perv! I'll be back at school the following night when he makes the foot massage," she said.</p> <p>"That's not quite true", I mocked.</p> <p>"It certainly was a lot better than masturbating", she giggled.</p> <p>Again I got a sly smile and a slightly wicked look from her, which suggested I wasn't trying very hard. However, I was thinking, at the very moment my hand was moving under her other leg, I should be embarrassed to be doing this to her, so I answered, "I'm sorry, my hand feels good."</p> <p>Mom's response to my compliment was quite clear, now that we were alone.</p> <p>I could clearly gauge the direction of my hands. I couldn't tell how big they were, and I kept my body language quite low, so as to not embarrass her.</p> <p>After a few more moments of silence, Mom took a sip from her glass of water. This went on for quite some time. After a while I was starting to become distracted, as I was looking at her pretty legs and now the way her thighs were moving under the blanket. Mom's movement on the blanket wasn't the most erotic sight.</p> <p>Finally, I looked up, looking at her right eyebrow, which was still slightly upturned, so she could see me clearly. I smiled and said, "Why didn't you tell me?"</p> <p>Mom giggled and nodded, just before she closed her mouth to say, "You see."</p> <p>"I am sorry I am in too much of a shock about this," I said.</p> <p>"Not really" her response was, "This is a pretty big shock for a teenager"</p> <p>"Don't be," I said, "This is just a young teenager going through the same kind of turmoil,"</p> <p>Mom smiled again and said, "Don't you understand what kind of age young people are when it comes to sex?"</p> <p>"I was shocked the first time I saw you naked," I said, "and it also seems to be all thanks to your legs. After some time, I found myself looking at you nude. It wasn't the first time I had had seen you. I was surprised though, I have never dreamed that the whole time I was watching you were in bed naked."</p> <p>"Is there are only we were just one bed," Mom and we had never have never even," me masturbated," I," I replied.</p> <p>"and just sleep," I lied—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
