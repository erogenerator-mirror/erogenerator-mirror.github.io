Ever consider and think upon the world as being but one living</h4><p><strong>substance, and having but one soul, and how all things in the world, are terminated into one sensitive power; and are done by one general motion as it were, and</strong> it happened all the time. We were all eighteen at the time, and all of us were in our sexual prime. It was not just that, and it couldn't all be over. I wanted a little time together with my friends, with some time alone together, alone to do things. I was getting my college degree, I was going to start going on dates, and I had no real plans of leaving that campus, and it made it easy, but it seemed like it was going to be the same all the time.</p> <p>But, here I was, feeling a lot more alone, being with a few other friends, and having a few dates myself. There is nothing to be done! I wanted to have a nice life, if it meant having a steady girlfriend. I wanted other women (at least one at the time, and that was two girlfriends), and I wanted some other sex. So, I got some wine, and relaxed.</p> <p>I had an appointment:</p> <p>After about a minute of just staring out the window, I began thinking about her. I was in heaven every time I had to touch myself, looking in the mirror. I wanted her and wanted her so much! This is what I needed. The best sex partner I've had is a girl. That would certainly be a bonus. Plus, I have no real friends around, and the world could use a friend.</p> <p>I remembered how she said she never had any. Maybe she said I was an 'older guy' because one day, I told her that I had a girlfriend (I'm 32!). I told her that she could come along, I was ready to start.</p> <p>I took her by the hand and led her to a room. She couldn't take her eyes of my ass, my tits as my breasts, and my legs as they were, I am a tall red-haired lady, 36DD-28-32 (not that big anymore). She asked me a lot of questions, even though she probably thought I was fat and ugly or something, and what if she had a friend (or just a date?) that I had, maybe she could start. It is hard for me to understand the way women are made in this world, especially about the size of their tits.</p> <p>We were both naked, and I felt very self-conscious. She took off all her clothes and we embraced and kissed. I was so eager I was ready to take her right there.</p> <p>She was on top of me in a few minutes, her clothes were scattered all over the room. I can't believe how much of me was on this earth; it felt as if I were on a planet where there had been no sex.</p> <p>She started kissing my neck, down near my boobs and breasts. She would kiss and lick my nipples, then suck on them, and I was surprised that my nipples were so hard that they are so hard when she licked and sucked them. Finally, her hands were on my pussy and she opened it up, and she put 2 finger in, started to run them in and out of my vagina, and to stimulate my clitoris as she did so.</p> <p>I was ready to come right now. I put my hand on her head, and pulled her up; I wanted to kiss her so bad.</p> <p>As I stood there, we looked towards one another, as if to start a long, happy line of kissing and then breaking out into a passionate embrace, we both were feeling aroused and wanton. I kissed her deeply, exploring her mouth with my tongue, sucking on her lips passionately. She responded to it like no one else does.</p> <p>After the kiss broke, we continued passionately and were soon going out of sight of the street. I didn't want to go back to her house, so I led her to a little table in another part of the room.</p> <p>I put a pillow on the table and knelt down; I kissed and licked, and started rubbing my fingers into the folds inside her. I felt her whole body tremble uncontrollably, as if I was touching the inside of her vagina to the point that she was moving it around in circles.</p> <p>After she got a firm grip on my hair she came so hard that the pain was instant. I was ready to stop it... I was ready to take her virginity. I looked up into her eyes, and saw her eyes were full of lust, I was ready to make love to her, to show her I was still in this world I belonged to. I looked up at her, still holding her hair, and she gave her best sign of approval.</p> <p>I stood up, taking off all of her clothing, including her clothes. I mean all of her clothes except her glasses and lingerie and bra. I am so lucky. As I have seen many times in life, but not in this world she wasn't really, I was one of the female to show her bodyâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
