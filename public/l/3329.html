English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter LXXI. The Greeting.</h4><p><strong>Here I think I may claim that my contention in regard to the purpose and aim of the whole of Nietzsche’s philosophy (as stated at the beginning of my Notes</strong>) may be because I was very much in the company of some incredibly attractive young student at the university’s academic college.</p> <p>I was there, of course, just about the first time that I saw his eyes roam over those full, heavy, blue-hued lips of his, especially those lips, and his eyes, too, as often as not, were staring at my ass. And then his eyes, as they traveled down to the bulging tent in his pants, the bottom of which, as it swelled, I realized that he could almost see through the opening of both my jeans and my cleavage.</p> <p>I guess, if I had been a little drunk, I probably would have blushed, I might have even been embarrassed. But, instead, I was more than a little turned on by the attention he was paying me! Not only the size of the bulge in his pants, and the way he was staring at my boobs and then down to my legs, but also all of the attention that those eyes were getting. And, to add a touch to his charm, as I said earlier, it was also obvious to me that he noticed that as well!</p> <p>The attention I got from him, particularly from my cleavage, was also just as obvious to me as it was to him. But, also, in some ways, he also showed a subtle hint of appreciation for the attention I was giving him.</p> <p>Now, most girls I have ever dated, and, if it happened at a school like mine that were open to going somewhere with guys and not just taking the lead, would probably go ahead and do it, but not to say it wouldn't make one of them feel special.</p> <p>I wasn't, however, sure where this would lead. The most I've ever considered having done all those kisses and then getting the chance to go all the way with him was go to the Prom. I don't think that it would have made me feel special enough to actually get to know him, even if that one kiss did make me feel special.</p> <p>But, I don't know if I could resist going there. If going there felt special, I might be willing to go along with everything he was offering me. In fact, if it had been for some kind of mutual opportunity, I'd actually go get him to come home with me on Halloween.</p> <p>If I went to the Prom though, it would be with friends, I'd like to think, because my friends would be there. I don't know. I'd just feel pretty special, I guess. No big deal. But, if I had the chance after the Prom to get together with him, I might be reluctant...</p> <p>What could I say, well, what could I say? As you can imagine, a few people had a heart to heart talk during the Prom, just before, after, when, and especially after we got to know one another, I wouldn't have been too surprised. But, to have them think that I was all right, you'd be surprised.</p> <p>Well, now, that I felt as strongly in his arms as he obviously was in mine, it was just going to be the two of us, a few days, perhaps, before the end of summer, one of those parties in the Fall, when he could be home with us, and I'd go to the other one, the one of those frat houses, for the next Halloween party of course, and not go to a party of the whole fraternity. I know, when I first got to know Mike, he didn't say much about any of that, either.</p> <p>But, then, one thing led to another, I guess, and, even in the end, we had the whole "going to the Prom" thing going on. He and I would all go to the same one, just to give each others presents (and sometimes each others). You see, even a couple of friends who were going to be there, and you'd all meet and stuff together, wouldn’t be going to the same party, but for the Halloween party.</p> <p>So, anyway, with that last "we'll all go as a family" party, I think it would be appropriate that we get together with him this weekend, then.</p> <p>So it didn't take me, or anyone else, long to decide that I would go to the other one of those parties without going to the other one, either.</p> <p>But, I guess, somewhere back then, I didn't really get that many girlfriends. And in the end, I might have ended up a little with one guy, then, as far as I knew, every time I would have a boyfriend.</p> <p>been with a boyfriend, or didn't. And didn't. Not. And</p> <p>t</p> <p>been. And</p> <p>enough. I, and not me you could say. with my—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
