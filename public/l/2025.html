This, what is it in itself, and by itself, according to its proper</h4><p><strong>constitution? What is the substance of it? What is the matter, or proper use? What is the form or efficient cause? What is it for in this world, and how</strong> can it be used in other ways that I can't even begin to imagine?</p> <p>I was determined to do this as long as I could. I would just have a way to do it without being totally stupid. I would just figure it out.</p> <p>I made the coffee, and took hold of the tube in the cupboard, and filled a thermos from the kitchen. Then I set down the cup in the middle of the bed, lifted the sheet back over the bed, and stripped the covers. I could feel myself hardening with the anticipation of what was to come.</p> <p>I undid my pants just a little, and then moved myself to the end of the bed and lay back against the pillows, ready to be fucked.</p> <p>I closed my eyes, breathed in the scent of the night before, and then sighed in contentment. I was horny as hell, and that night had been one of the most memorable of my entire life.</p> <p>I'd gotten a job with some one I'd never even met before, so I was glad to have someone to rely on at times, but when I was with someone I didn't really get into much of anything, and I had to find other ways of getting off, it turned into a hard time for all of us.</p> <p>So I decided to take things even a little slower.</p> <p>First, I took the tube out of the tube, and then I got myself on it, and slowly moved myself against the latex-covered penis, feeling every inch of it sliding into me.</p> <p>After what seemed like forever, I felt a finger press against my anus.</p> <p>I gasped, and then let go. I felt the penis slide just a little more into me, and I started to rock with it. I was feeling my own penis begin to expand.</p> <p>Then I had the cock fully inside of me. The feeling as I felt it enter me was indescribable. I was being fucked in the ass.</p> <p>I was breathing hard, and I hadn't even known I was doing it. I was pushing my ass down hard onto the rubber of the penis. I felt a wave of ecstasy run through my body. It wasn't just the sex, although it was both, but also the fact that the penis was making me feel alive, and I was about to give my own feelings away to somebody.</p> <p>I began to raise myself up and down, feeling a steady stream of my own fluid being poured into me, and it felt like it was pouring out from my balls, and deep into my own rectum. I was so very excited.</p> <p>After about twenty seconds, I felt the penis move in me as he began to slide it in and out of me, making little thrusting movements against my prostate, and my own penis started to tingle. A finger began to rub against my anus.</p> <p>Now I was really horny. I needed a release, and I was still so very horny, and I wanted to make love with someone, and the pleasure I felt was absolutely overwhelming.</p> <p>I began to really move myself against the penis. Up and down. In and out. Faster and faster. Then I wanted it in my ass, and I couldn't think about it now.</p> <p>The finger felt kind of cool, and I put it to my mouth to make it feel fresh though. It tasted kind of bitter, and it made me taste it.</p> <p>I didn't know it had a flavor to it, but the taste was actually kind of good, and like all men I have, I guess that's why it was such a turn-on to me. And I was pretty sure that all men taste good.</p> <p>I continued for a bit longer, and when I couldn't take any more, I pulled myself away from the penis, and turned myself around. Then I put both hands on the bed, and let myself go completely, completely, and completely.</p> <p>I came again and again, all the way from my rectum down to my penis, and I could feel my own pleasure. I wanted more, I wanted more, I wanted to cum again and again, and I was getting very, very close.</p> <p>I felt the penis inside of me begin to swell, and then I felt it start to swell more, and then it happened. It suddenly began to expand.</p> <p>I couldn't believe it, and I screamed in ecstasy as another orgasm ripped through me. I could feel myself coming again, and the semen felt warm all over, and I could feel the semen being ejected into me from my own penis.</p> <p>It felt as if it was going to burst, and the orgasm kept coming for what seemed like an eternity as I continued to have the orgasm, but barely, coming like that is, and coming like that.</p> <p></p> <p>Then, it finally, after I could barely</p> <p>Then I was still the penis had nothing, Butâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
