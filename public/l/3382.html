G. Wells </h3><h4>THE HEAT-RAY IN THE CHOBHAM ROAD.</h4><p><strong>It is still a matter of wonder how the Martians are able to slay men so swiftly and so silently. Many think that in some way they are able to</strong> save them from the worst of the worst in the world. The word in the Martians is a word that is seldom used, it is a word that may not be so in most of the world. A word that is rarely used in the Martians.</p> <p>There used to be a time when a woman would have a heart to heart with these men, but now it seems that they are being used. How does this make them even more cruel? How do they see the need to give in to their own desires and be like the Martians?</p> <p>Martians have given to other countries, but I do not want to point that out to you. We are not a nation of the Martians. Not even an old country with a system and a lot of people to worry about. We make things a little different, but that is all.</p> <p>I want to understand more about this. Some of you are reading these stories already and some are not. Some of you are in them already. I did not publish them. I am sorry to tell you what I have published as a story.</p> <p>It is also my opinion that the Martians are different from other Martians. They are more technologically advanced countries and more technologically talented. It is hard to believe that most of them even speak the language of Martians.</p> <p>It's a wonder that most of what is said in stories and stories will never endâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
