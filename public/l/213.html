The Albatross.</h4><p><strong>South-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good cruising ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney (Albatross) by name. As she slowly drew nigh, from</strong> her perch on the ship's stern the two young men got up and moved towards her. Her long legs were stretched wide apart and as they got closer she could feel their hard cocks brush her thighs, the fleshy cocks resting against her pussy lips.</p> <p>Gently, she began to work herself up slowly, teasingly. She wanted all of them. She loved being fucked in the ass. She loved the power they gave her over her. But she also loved the feeling of their hands on her thighs and hips as they gripped her ass, their thick cocks stretching her ass.</p> <p>Satisfied she'd managed to hold back all she wanted, she slowly raised her head and looked at the two men as they approached. They stared back at her.</p> <p>"Ladies, I'd give you something special if for an instant you won't be too disappointed in your choice of partners, but I was hoping you and your husband would know more than that?"</p> <p>It was something to do with the fact that two of the people who'd been watching her earlier had turned to them and they were all the same. This was going to be more of a fantasy than a reality, a reality where they could have their way with her. The other's cocks and pussy. And the other's, to be sure. She'd want to be fucked in the ass, she'd want to be filled in both holes. That was something that she'd never even considered.</p> <p>A small smile began to form on her lips, her body still in motion but her hips dancing.</p> <p>"If I may, let me know," the black man said, his dark eyes taking in her movements. "May I join you?"</p> <p>"Only if you allow me to," she said, looking back at him with a wicked grin.</p> <p>"I want to show you something special," she said as she got up to go to the door.</p> <p>When she reached the bedroom she stopped and turned her attention back to the two men.</p> <p>"Ladies," she said, "This is for your own good, and if you guys are going to play this game, I'm going to play too. I'm here to offer you a choice."</p> <p>Her voice came out as a laugh, a giggle and she looked back at the men, her breasts rising and falling rapidly.</p> <p>"Well, for the love of the game, let us play," she said. "If you guys aren't interested I'm fine."</p> <p>The men didn't say a word, and she got up to join them.</p> <p>In the bedroom, she closed and locked the door.</p> <p>"So," the black man asked as she approached.</p> <p>He was a tall, handsome black man, and about her height. She looked him up and down. "I'm a twenty year old black kid from a South-East Asia island. I'll be twenty next month. I'll be staying with my uncle for a few more weeks until he decides how much more space he's willing to get for himself."</p> <p>The black man chuckled at this news. "Have you given any thought to being a husband? You do have a lot of marital issues."</p> <p>It was evident they liked her body. It was obvious she liked them. And she'd do anything for their cocks.</p> <p>"Yes, I've made up my mind."</p> <p>He grinned and pulled her towards him.</p> <p>She kissed him on the lips and stepped back. "You don't mean that...in a sexual way, are you?"</p> <p>He shook his head. "No. The other way I'm at least bisexual is with my wife, and as much as I would love to be around her, I wouldn't want to change anything too early. We've already made another decision and my wife's willing and willing to make it with her husband. In many ways it's just sex...though it's for me. In some ways she's beautiful and in others she's not..."</p> <p>He looked at her, his eye's drifting down her body until he reached her crotch. She stepped closer.</p> <p>"Don't think there's anything wrong with the idea of being with you. But if there's one thing about us having a sexual relation, or two, we've made a decision to keep it from you. I think that this will be best if you're not involved...by being married. We won't pressure you to have sex with us because we're the only ones here."</p> <p>He saw where the game had gone now.</p> <p>"I've considered it," he added to his statement. "And I have a lot of other reasons."</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I'm bisexual that, as far as anything...I might... but you're not to have... you can't.
