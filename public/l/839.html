He was walking home about eleven o’clock from Lord Henry’s, where</strong> he'd been invited to go to, at eight fifty-five, he heard a noise on a small part of the apartment building. He was on his way up, and as he approached the window above the building, he saw a figure leaning back on a lamp post, and a rather attractive young woman, probably in her mid twenties, dressed in a short summer dress, standing beside the little window, her body clothed in a matching skimpy halter dress. And they were engaged in what appeared to be a very passionate kiss.</p> <p>"Oh, my sweet little angel, that's so sexy...do you find your sexy little angel very sexy?" the young woman asked, as she continued to lightly rub herself on his shoulder.</p> <p>"Oh, he loves me," the young woman in front of the window moaned, as she pressed her body against his. "I wish we could be like this all the time!"</p> <p>"Yes, yes we can be," the young woman moaned, as she leaned forward and kissed his lips with a soft passionate kiss. "But why don't you come inside and join the party."</p> <p>"Why not?"</p> <p>"Honey, I don't want to be too formal. I need to enjoy myself. But if you don't want us to share our passionate kisses with each other on the door step, come on inside, and join the party. I have to tell you you are right, but I'll leave you to find your friend."</p> <p>And finally a smile crossed his face, as he realized that she definitely meant he could join some of their other friends, but that wouldn't be his thing. And besides, as he realized he had to stop himself, he thought it would be easier to stop himself from joining her, to just go on with this adventure and enjoy it as it was. But alas, all he could think of was to see if there was a way to stop this temptation. And as he did so, he suddenly heard the sound of the sound of heels on the carpeting. This meant, perhaps, the young man had a new conquest.</p> <p>"Oops," he said. "Sorry!"</p> <p>Now the young woman, who was wearing a light floral dress, was standing beside the apartment window, and this young man, who had no idea who this woman was, was standing behind a window. But the young man also had a look of shock on his face, as he suddenly realized they were engaged in a moment of wild passion, and they were in his apartment, and he was with a beautiful, young, beautiful woman. And the young man's eyes and ears began to feel the blood rush to the extremities of his cock. Oh my...he could not wait to tell his friends that his date was fucking his fiancée! As he felt his own cock begin to throb, he took his eyes off of her and looked her in the face, which looked to be glowing with anticipation. Then, he looked to see that the young stud was behind her, his hands now caressing her ass.</p> <p>"Are you kidding?" the young stud cried. "I have never touched a woman there before! And you're a woman! You are really gorgeous!"</p> <p>"Oh, darling," she moaned. "Oh, darling! You've never touched a man before, have you? Oh, God, I want to kiss you. I want to do all the things my tongue can't."</p> <p>And suddenly, she grabbed his head, turned it towards her. He felt her tongue suddenly touch his lips, and they kissed passionately for several seconds, but she then stopped kissing him and began to whisper in his ear.</p> <p>"Kiss me again," she said. "Maybe we should have a little fun before we go out."</p> <p>"No, wait," he said. "Wait for us. Please...kiss me again."</p> <p>This is what she said, as he took her into his arms. They kissed for a long time, not saying anything, but he felt the warmth growing in between his legs, and was ready to explode just from the feel of her lips on his lips, which were like fire, and her touch, which made his heart race like a steam train. Finally, she broke the kiss and began kissing his neck, running her tongue lightly from his ear to the lobe.</p> <p>"I want to feel your cock in my hands very soon," she moaned. "Let me caress it and make it throb. I want to feel it, and I want to see it!"</p> <p>"Yes, darling."</p> <p>The young man, who had been holding her and gently kissing, and hugging her now came forward and pressed her on top of the window sill. With his hands, he felt her breasts, and caressed them felt the outline of her nipples. Then, they caressed the breast, as they were pressed her nipple.
