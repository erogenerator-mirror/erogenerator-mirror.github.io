"Your power within this world and our country is greater than all of ours apart from this very Holy Order of the Church of the Saints and Saints. We are God's answer to the problems and temptations of man and woman. We are God's perfect guide to help you discover the ways of God."</p> <p>"It's been your faith and your love that has caused me so much frustration among my sisters."</p> <p>"Well," said the Reverend. "I can see where and how you can prove your love and devotion to God."</p> <p>"And the same applies to you?"</p> <p>"And the same applies to me," said the Reverend. "A person's love can never change what is and is not real."</p> <p>"Yes, you are right. How can it be so obvious? Can we never be real? It makes us false just like everything else is? You are our God," said the Reverend.</p> <p>"But you already feel that way," said the Virgin. "Even that is false. What does that say about you?" she said, looking away again. "How can I be a real being with you and not be just a sexual object to help you get what you need?"</p> <p>The Reverend continued to point at the microphone, and the microphone itself fell out of a piece of fabric that was at the end of a microphone stand, and was no more than an inch from his hand. "I confess that, at least," he said, "you are a true person."</p> <p>"Yes, I am a true woman," said the Virgin with a wry grin.</p> <p>"And you have a penis too, correct?" said the Reverend. "Let's see if we can find the nerve to have sex?"</p> <p>"Yes," said the Virgin. "We have a phallus we have to use to pleasure ourselves."</p> <p>"Very well," responded the Reverend. "You can begin now."</p> <p>"What do you say?" asked the Virgin. "Would that be enough?"</p> <p>"Yes!" exclaimed the Reverend. "That's enough! We've got one of the sexiest women ever, right in the flesh."</p> <p>He began by placing two fingers into his cock. He rubbed it against the Virgin's clit, and she moaned, feeling how wet it was. As it hardened, he inserted his middle finger as deep into the Virgin as he could reach.</p> <p>"Oh," she said, as she closed her eyes and moved about below the microphone. Soon he was sliding his fingers out of the Virgin's hole with each stroke, and then plunging both hands into her pussy. Soon his fingers were probing the inner lips of the Virgin's pussy.</p> <p>"Do you enjoy being a sex object, my dear?" he said.</p> <p>"Oh, yes!" she replied, as she lifted her feet against the podium.</p> <p>"Would you be a good toy for me, a toy that I could fuck myself, with my manhood!"</p> <p>"I think that we will find out now," said the Reverend.</p> <p>With this, the Virgin rose up, and straddled his hips, her wet pussy just above his cock. She began to lower herself, feeling it slide through the wetness of her own pussy, along the edge of her hole a little. "Please put it in, please put it inside," she said. "You have the most magical manhood you can find, and it feels like it is moving along your cunt."</p> <p>"So does it," said the Reverend.</p> <p>"Yes, it does," she said.</p> <p>"Are you close to an orgasm?"</p> <p>"No!"</p> <p>"Can I finish?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes," replied the Reverend. "I want to finish. Keep fucking me."</p> <p>"As long as you don't stop," he replied, as he thrust his body forward to match her movements.</p> <p>"Oh, YES!" she shouted as she came.</p> <p>He kept pumping at her, even though he was close to an orgasm. "Please, please finish!" she said. She was getting close, and suddenly felt that familiar feeling of warmth, when a wave of her orgasm hit her as she felt a spurturise.</p> <p>"I'm cumming!"</p> <p>"Yes!"</p> <p>"Shove your pleasure! feeling pleasure, pleasure!"</p> <p></p> <p>"And then!"</p> <p>and andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
