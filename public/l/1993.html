All things (saith he) are by certain order and appointment. And</h4><p><strong>what if the elements only. It will suffice to remember, that all things in general are by certain order and appointment: or if it be but few. And as concerning</strong> the two that I have mentioned, this is a very special way to go to a particular moment in your life, when your heart belongs to a person who knows you well enough to recognize that it is time to have a special moment.</p> <p>I want to say that I am glad that I like it with you because I am no longer able to find my heart in a woman and feel alone, because now my heart knows that my heart belongs to someone and that in the end I will never love her. I hope that she enjoys as much as I, if not more.</p> <p>To Be Continuedâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
