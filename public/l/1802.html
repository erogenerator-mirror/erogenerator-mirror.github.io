To Rusticus I am beholding, that I first entered into the conceit</h4><p><strong>that my life wanted some redress and cure. And then, that I did not fall into the ambition of ordinary sophists, either to write tracts concerning the common theorems, or</strong> to find out how a civilization could be better explained by its own ideals, or to be a more precise definition of the human race than we already do.</p> <p>At least now it was just "the human race", but that was not necessarily what made it better. In America, sex was a very basic matter and not the issue of how it should be observed, rather than what kind of person they are, but I still did not like it when the man had it done himself. I was still not ready to actually be on the offensive against him. And, though it was only once or twice a week in a college class, even then I had to admit it was a lot more exciting for me to see a man with his pants undone than when a guy did it himself. Sure, it was just a matter of how it felt and not what the "normal" man would go for and should prefer, but then it still had to be something.</p> <p>Sex was also not much of a turn off for young men in the United States. They found that their fantasies could simply be told one to stop fantasizing and get on with the act. But the men could tell to stay on to their fantasies. Especially when their sexual fantasies had a certain purpose beyond the one they would be performing. I could certainly imagine what it would be like to try something like that out with one of those young men. A couple of the boys I had tutored in college had already gone the long way around the subject. My own fantasy was just that: a boy getting his penis sucked and having his dick licked and sucked for a while until he came. But then the fantasy had turned into something else.</p> <p>There was a small, dark-haired woman in every story in my class. She was a woman I had tutored over in college. And I had to admit that she was very appealing. Although I was just a boy, I learned much from her. She was an intelligent woman, smart and beautiful in a different way. And it seemed there was more to her as a girl than just that. It seemed to be the case in most of my male students. They just weren't into their teacher.</p> <p>I really did not have anything to be ashamed of. I was just a boy and I was an attractive man like everyone else. As I had learned, I had one particular problem and it was related to that. I was a lot more of a "man" than many Americans realized.</p> <p>My girlfriend had told me that she wanted to get back in line. She had found something in a couple of of the book stores in the area that offered massage class. It was actually a private university campus, but its members were all male and would probably find it quite pleasurable. Of course, it was not the sort of thing I had been planning for my own hands, but I was certain it had a great chance of having a good time. And I decided right then that it might be a good time to move to our new home and experience both the freedom of a young man and the excitement of the school day.</p> <p>So the day took a little by mystery. We were the only two students in our class, and there were four of us. We were all going to be working together. So after a quick lunch in a small, dark and quiet corner of the school, we sat around the table, watching as three girls - none of which I recognized - were making advances at one another. That was a bit unusual, perhaps, because a female student was going to be working with her male teacher. I mean, I was sure that my teacher - or her mentor, if she was anything like a male - would not be coming over to my class. But then I think we all just agreed that this was just a one-time thing. The point, of course, was that there was no doubt whatsoever about who would go for who. A young man, after all, was not to be singled out, in fact.</p> <p>The girl was just very good looking, certainly very pretty, but very much a woman. She was dressed conservatively, almost a bikini. And she was not wearing panties and I knew that she was shaved. So she certainly seemed interested in me. And I certainly had a feeling that she was, indeed, interested in me. That is perhaps the part of the male student who finds it difficult to maintain a relationship with a guy after a session of intimacy, and I will never forget it. However, a little research could have led to some positive results.</p> <p>As it was, my boyfriend was my best available male friend. He was a very attractive man, but it would have been very easy for him to do whatever he liked. The girl was a little less than average in the looks but also a little in quality in the looks. She was definitely nothing but a very little, but an alluring body. I thought.
