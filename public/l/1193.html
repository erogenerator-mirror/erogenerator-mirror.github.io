Not a window was opened, not a door stood ajar; it was the dawn but not the awaking. The end of the Rue de la</strong> Caune was visible with the morning sunlight, the sea rose, the sun began to crest its peak. The water that flowed past the shoreline could not be seen from the shore.</p> <p>The first thing that struck me most was that the water looked almost entirely clean because of the fact that it was so clear. However, it took off down the water on the first attempt because it had some very sharp rocks in the rocks on either side. At least there was an almost clear water surface on both sides of me.</p> <p>If I was to keep looking down, I would have noticed that the water was a little lower than a natural sea. The surface was also rather clean. And the clear water was actually very cool. I was actually feeling a bit guilty about going out like this. I kept thinking about the fact that the whole thing may have been a one-time thing. I really just couldn't figure out how a man made love with a woman whose entire life he never thought he'd be with, let alone a single lady who would think that sex was a one-time act.</p> <p>"Oh shit, I better get dressed first," I told myself as the sun started to come out again. Then, I noticed that I was still walking slowly along behind me. My skirt had gotten a little tighter and the hem of it had risen more. I felt so stupid that I had a little trouble walking in the dark. Then I went ahead because I had better not have a flash of the panties, especially a bra underneath.</p> <p>It was nearly six p.m. when I finished putting on my jacket. All I wanted to do now was go to bed and forget about last night. Then the worst possible thing I could say in the situation was that, after I turned down a stair landing and walked across the street to my bed, my panties had dropped down and showed that I wore nothing under my little blue skirt.</p> <p>What the hell was wrong with me? At least I was honest enough to leave it that way without going home. I could walk home without worrying that I was wearing a bra. And that I even did it in the dark. But I thought about it. It really was a bit of a risk, because my panties were in the dark; there was really no chance of that. I also thought about how lucky I was that I had gone to bed in the dark at the right time; that had given me such a thrill. I knew that it was probably going to take a little time to get ready for bed and be able to see the front of my dress so that I could see the bulge in my panties whenever I got up to my bedroom door.</p> <p>The second thing that I thought about when I thought about that was the fact that once I got myself into bed, I might not think again about wearing a bra and panties that night as soon as I got up to my bed. And at the same time, maybe the memory of a hot guy having sex with me would not come into my mind as soon as it arrived.</p> <p>I tried to make myself as clear as I could. Then, after another half hour's worth of walking, I walked slowly and calmly around the corner of the street and down the sidewalk to my bedroom. My panties did get dropped down, which brought me to my room.</p> <p>I looked around in the dark to make sure that I wasn't actually wearing a bra underneath. I thought about putting on a pair of panties, but the thought of doing that made my panties all the more wet. Even as my mind tried to convince myself, my body wanted that very much.</p> <p>At least then I got off the elevator way before I got an erection. If only the chance of getting one would pass when my mind was so clear headed I didn't even try to make it last as long as I did. After all, if I got one as quickly as I wanted, there was no way that even a one-time thing was going to come off in the bright moonlight.</p> <p>If I was right to think about it and not let myself feel guilty, if I could see something that was truly something special because of the way my body felt the thought of getting undressed was still so tempting. Or if I would give myself a little more time to be sure that it was really going to happen when I would fall into bed naked and not realize that I had been trying so much to put up a wall between the two desires that I was feeling the most of all. But the truth is, I wasn't sure that I could make it. In the end, I just wanted to get into bed and get out of the dark and do some serious thinking about sex.</p> <p>When I got to my bedroom, and got into bed, there was a little more light coming out from the door on my dresser way down the inside the light coming outside. I was already there was more light showing through to my bed's bed.
