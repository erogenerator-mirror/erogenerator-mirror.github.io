OF POWER ECCLESIASTICALL</h4><p><strong>For the understanding of POWER ECCLESIASTICALL, what, and in whom it is, we are to distinguish the time from the Ascension of our Saviour, into two parts; one before the</strong> ascension and the Other, which takes place after the Ascension, which takes place after the Ascension, and that which takes place after the Ascension, and we will be of more than just a few days apart.</p> <p>Let us set up our position in this world. At this stage you will know everything that I have learnt thus far; that which you can not have already.</p> <p>We can get into the positions that I will teach you to make love with both us; but first, we have to see what each of us is capable and how good we can do it together.</p> <p>If you are able to achieve all three you will see, I will be so happy that I can share that.</p> <p>I will start off slowly.</p> <p>I will be able to show you how to touch and kiss each other and use my mouth to make love. I will teach you to be my first sexual partner, because I am sure you will appreciate that. But if you prefer to be intimate with me, do not make love to me, because if you have to I think that you will not love me, and you will not be able to love yourself. We will work on that.</p> <p>We will be in control of how well we kiss, and in how we perform these things. It will be your first time with a girl, it may be at your first time, but you should be ready, and very happy with me to help you both.</p> <p>Of course, I already know what to do and how to make love to a girl, but I will explain to you at least some of the basics of lovemaking. You will learn the technique of kissing: your mouth is flat and opens to your lover, your tongue is like a tent, and your lips are soft and moist. Kissing is important with both of us.</p> <p>I will teach you to use the soft tongue. You will be able to use that tongue, but you will only have to use your mouth on me. Use other tongue instead.</p> <p>Once you have been kissing me for a half hour you will be able to tell me how good you feel; and when you kiss me it will be like you have never been kissed before. You can go on like that for a while.</p> <p>You will be able to make love when you have to, but I will tell you that. Sometimes a girl will kiss you for half an hour with me on each side of her. Sometimes, she will kiss you for half an hour with me on her.</p> <p>You will be able to say, "Yes," whenever I have to kiss her, "Thank you."</p> <p>This is also a skill that many girls possess. They don't use that phrase "I love you." It means, "Yes, I love you." It's that phrase.</p> <p>To make love to her, we have to make love with us other people in our bodies. We have to make love with other people inside us. We have to make love with people outside our bodies. We have to make love with other people inside my body.</p> <p>I will be able to teach you the joy of lovemaking. We will teach you the art of oral sex, and the way to make love. You will learn all this from experience. You will learn something that you don't even know for yourself. You won't ever learn everything that you never knew.</p> <p>When I kiss you I am sure that your tongue is a tool, because, as soon as you start to kiss me, I can feel that it's something that you are going to learn. I am sure that you will enjoy it.</p> <p>By the time you kiss me I will have learned everything that I am afraid to learn, but even if I don't like it, I will take the lessons of lovemaking and learn it to a point, a degree.</p> <p>But I will not teach you to kiss girls, because I will teach you how to enjoy oral sex. It will be so much better to enjoy the moment of pleasure.</p> <p>But, it is the very special place that I like to do most of our lovemaking. Sometimes one girl will do the same. Now, tell me how it feels.</p> <p>Sometimes you will lick her with the tip of your tongue and with lips; and sometimes, she will lick your own lips with her tongue.</p> <p>For me, the first time I have ever been kissed by a girl, I felt that it was a most natural thing to do, and therefore, I think that it is the same as the first time I've kissed a woman. And of course, the second time I was kissed by another woman, I felt that it was not as natural as the first time I had kissed a girl. Then in fronting a woman's lips.</p> <p>This is what I have learnt is what we have learnt about lovemaking lovemaking love making lovemakingâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
