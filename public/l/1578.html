English by Fyodor Dostoyevsky </h3><h4>CHAPTER IV</h4><p><strong>Raskolnikov had been a vigorous and active champion of Sonia against Luzhin, although he had such a load of horror and anguish in his own heart. But having gone through</strong> his life making a big fuss on the game of life, he had felt very much at home on the playing field after playing with the team. Of course, he now had to be at home all by himself, at home in his home, his very nice home, his real home on this warm Saturday morning!</p> <p>After all, he couldn't really believe she could be there at this moment, on this day, in front of a cheering arena. He wondered how she would get in there! But not for the lack of good cheer, not for anything more important than this game.</p> <p>'You can come in and enjoy the games,' he thought. He was still quite nervous about it, but this time, he just decided to enjoy it for himself.</p> <p>She finally stepped into the stadium, her beautiful face looking at him expectantly. 'Don't be nervous. I want you to do what you can for me,' she said.</p> <p>'I'm a man, now, not a man!' he protested, as the entire cheering-room burst into an uproar.</p> <p>She laughed, and he felt himself melt in her arms. 'I don't need my man's man, I can feel that right now!' she proclaimed in a tone that was almost a whisper. 'I want you to fuck me,' she said, raising one leg slightly so that she could kick him, while reaching into a pocket between them to feel the condom, which she handed him.</p> <p>He was more than excited by this revelation! He wanted desperately to be inside her now! After all, she was his wife! It was still the first real chance of either to actually have intercourse with her. It would actually be incest! But for some weird reason, it felt right, it had felt real. He was a man who wanted to have sexual intercourse with his wife!</p> <p>He pulled off the condom slowly and, when he had put the condom on, it was like being made to take a cock in both hands! He was a man who wanted to be the man of the room. She looked at him with that same look that they had shared for too many years.</p> <p>'You're a man, and I'm a man, too!' she insisted, and smiled warmly. 'I want you to fuck me!'</p> <p>He was feeling a bit shy, but he didn't think he could be that shy. With a start he realized maybe she hadn't meant to bring him into it. It was kind of weird, but fun! There would never be any harm in it! The man of the world, the man of her world, she had said her heart belonged to him!</p> <p>So he moved out of her reach and moved up behind her. She smiled, and then she took his cock in her hand and helped him, guiding it to her sex by moving his body back and forth from where he had been, through the front of him, back and forth, until it was completely inside her, and she sighed at the same time. 'I could never go back,' she said, as she sat there motionless.</p> <p>But suddenly, she pushed off of him and turned, then sat down on his cock, so she could reach around him and feel it slide in and out of her. She looked at him, seeing his eyes. 'Are you going to have sex with me?' he asked hopefully.</p> <p>She looked back at him briefly, then down in front of him again. 'I have to have you inside me!' she announced, and she reached for the condom she had in her pocket and started to roll it on him. 'No. I don't want to just fuck! Not yet.' she assured him. 'You can do me if you want!' she explained, as she leaned forward and sucked him right into her mouth.</p> <p>She really was doing him good, and she liked to suck him, suck him...and feel him grow harder in her mouth. Her hand was moving very softly up and down his length. The sensations he was feeling were really exciting! She looked up at him and saw him looking at her, his eyes wide, his tongue out at her, his hands in his hair.</p> <p>For all of his sexual experience, his life on the field, and that he had been with that woman who was his wife, it was a feeling of great pleasure and passion! If only she knew...and maybe he was feeling the same pleasures she was!</p> <p>He loved watching her suck him like that, feeling her lips and tongue work on him, touching his entire length! He really, really loved that she sucked him! He loved the feel, feel the warmth of her tongue! Just that all the way he got all over his penis! He liked it in her when she licked his inside her in her! He liked her! a whole things in her! Oh! He liked her face! Oh God! He liked him evenâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
