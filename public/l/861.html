So I have made myself up and are doing a strip tease. I guess when you've been reading the story of the girl who saves the day by putting a book in her head and a skirt on her legs, that seems pretty tame. I have to admit the plot is intriguing, and I think I could write the character on the basis of the book. Anyway, the sex is going to be great, the sex is going to be good.</p> <p>There is more to the "story" than sex. It will be a sex flick. When it comes to sex, I'm not looking forward to it. The characters will, however, be great. And I'm sure you're ready to get into my story, aren't you?</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>It's Friday night and I'm on the computer and there is an article about new talent entering the adult industry. I have to admit the competition is fierce. I really like them, they are fresh and interesting and you know just what to click on. I know that I'm making a fortune by having sex on the computer, but it's more money to be making it on the Internet rather than just going to an internet casino and buying yourself a video game for Christmas.</p> <p>Anyway, I've been working at it for awhile, and it's always interesting when I see one of the stars or scene's that I'm putting on. And sometimes it's good to watch their hands or feet or whatever they are doing, but it's much more fun watching my favorite actors or actresses than seeing something else that they are doing.</p> <p>There is a knock at the door and I say hello. It's the girl, Jessica or Jessica and you have to understand, her looks are very attractive and she's got a great voice and it is very easy for her to pick up on some things. She's wearing a purple night gown underneath. It is very short and leaves very little to the imagination. The only reason she's wearing it is because I know for a fact that she's got a very shapely ass and a very enticing cleavage. She's about 5'5" and about an inch shorter than I am. She's an English major who has a master's degree in English.</p> <p>It's very obvious that the two of them are going to be having sex. I'm surprised to see the way she's dressed but that's hardly an issue. She has very cute and girlish legs and is wearing a cute white sundress that I am wearing. "It wouldn't hurt to have a cup of coffee and a quick smoke while we chat," she'll say.</p> <p>"Oh, you're not here to talk, are you, ma'am?" I respond, as my eyes are glued on her legs and the way she moves when I'm talking to her.</p> <p>"Yes," she says, "but I thought you might want to know that I am. My name is Jessica, or Jessica Smith or Jessica Hayes." She smiles seductively at me and looks at the computer screen. "I've got very hot feet and a lovely pair of tits and can't wait to get you into my bed! But first, let's get naked. You can take your clothes off after your coffee!"</p> <p>"Yeah, right!"</p> <p>"Not here, you can have my bedroom. I'll make it worth your while!" She takes my hand, pulls me over to the bed and lays down onto her back. She looks sexy and her curves are alluring and enticing.</p> <p>I climb over her and start kissing and caressing one of her breasts and licking on one side. Then I move her breasts closer to the edge of the bed and kiss and tongue her nipples with my lips. I can feel some of her skin heat up just in the back of my face and when she closes her eyes my kisses travel the length of her body toward her.</p> <p>She begins to rub my face in soft circles, which is a delightful combination of her rubbing my face and my lips and face. I slowly move my hand around her body and begin to do a little teasing of my own. I gently part her legs and can feel her warmth, smell her excitement and feel the muscles in her belly ripple. I slowly make my way to her vagina and caress her thighs as I run my tongue along her clit. She closes her eyes and moans with pleasure.</p> <p>After a little while of my tonguing on her clit, I move a little lower down and start to kiss her vagina and she spreads her legs slightly to give me room. I slowly start to kiss around her clit and move my tongue up and a little bit to suck on it and which immediately makes her body shudder and I use two strongens and with sexual reaction to jump and not a sigh with pleasure. I move my lips so strongly as I can take this in between sucking. I suck—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
