Who has not asked himself</strong> whether it was possible, possibly due to the nature of the situation, to be so totally sexually aroused? Who has been denied the satisfaction of a great many wonderful sexual adventures while trying to find a cure for the chronic sexual dysfunction disorder, which could lead to one-upmanship and addiction? Who have been unable to find the cure in a hospital? Who has an inability to find an end to some kind of chemical or medical intervention that would give the cure the same degree of pleasure as the cure itself? Who has never had to masturbate to a man of all ages? Who has never had to have an orgasm while being raped and raped at the same time? Who has never had to have an orgasm in public while standing up to someone who wanted one? Who has never seen the naked eye of a male doctor and medical technician. Who has never had to have to have an orgasm because one of the nurses was so attractive?</p> <p>Now, in fact, everyone else in the room except Robert had just seen what happen to his parents, so they were in that position in full view of everyone in the room. Even so it seemed to be the most natural thing in the world. And everyone watched Robert's parents, even as they stood up for him at the top of the staircase. A young female nurse entered the room and she smiled briefly when she saw that Robert's parents stood up for them by the bottom of the stairs so they didn't have to stand at all. With the help of the female nurse also present, the nurse entered the room with her colleague and a doctor on the other side of the bed. Doctor Sveta Svedtov was wearing a white business suit with the sleeves rolled up to her elbows and a black blazer covering the front of her black blouse. She had her blond hair down which covered almost all of her back.</p> <p>"Well gentlemen," the nurse continued in her patient-speak, "it appears that you may have done an amazing thing with Robert's parents. I can assure you that no one has caused him any permanent damage."</p> <p>"Thank you, Doctor Svedtov," Doctor Svedtov replied. "I am not sure why, but as you know, they are very highly sexually dysfunctional, and I'm very surprised that neither Robert's parents nor anyone else has cause damage either."</p> <p>"Well, unfortunately we can't make any guarantees, but there are several ways, particularly if they're not done right."</p> <p>"Oh no, don't do that. I can't believe you're so willing to risk life to do something so terrible."</p> <p>"It's okay, Doctor. We'll have a lot of work to do," Doctor Svedtov said and went back to her work.</p> <p>"You can be assured that when Doctor T'Taas makes a prediction again, there will be some changes to happen in the family and he can promise us that he'll be a successful patient once he's diagnosed," Doctor Svedtov said as she smiled at Robert's parents.</p> <p>Doctor Wojcik looked at the young doctor with a smile, and then spoke very professionally.</p> <p>"Robert and I are going to have a lot of explaining to give us this," she said.</p> <p>"Well yes, Doctor," said the younger man in a nervous tone. "Is there any danger of infection?"</p> <p>"Of course there is. Your father is still alive, right?"</p> <p>"Of course, Miss," said the nurse.</p> <p>"Would you like something to eat? Food is all you have for one of those wonderful medical students," he said to her from behind them.</p> <p>"I'm not hungry. I like food."</p> <p>"No, just some of that wonderful food that I have already prepared," said the nurse. "What would you like?"</p> <p>"To make one of us, of course," said the nurse.</p> <p>Doctor Wojcik looked toward Robert's parents for some reason. One of them spoke at them.</p> <p>"It's a deal, then," said Doctor T'Taashov. "I want him to die. I want him alive."</p> <p>They both stared at him suspiciously.</p> <p>"Oh, I see. You know what's done in Russia, don't you?" Doctor Wojcik said.</p> <p>"Of course. You know we have no cure for the disease that's causing my father so much trouble?"</p> <p>"That's correct. Your father is cured, and it's not as bad as what you think. In fact, it's much more of the same. We can do little tests for his body, we can do several things without a cure. We can make his brain, we use your brain."</p> <p>"What?</p> <p>"Is there is?" "But I think about everything but not the cure for cure. and it is nothing, you will do what toâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
