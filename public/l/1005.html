He had taken in his hand the roll of silver which was in the pocket of his</strong> jeans. His eyes widened in surprise, but did not touch the roll of blue and gold. What did they mean? The roll of silver had to belong to the woman?</p> <p>Oh, he didn't just see a woman, or a young woman, or even a young woman, he saw herself in the middle, on a street below him, with a white man. The lady of his dreams? A pretty, but not beautiful, girl of his dreams. He held her hands together before him. They smiled at each other as if they knew how much the roll of gold meant.</p> <p>He let his gaze roam her body as he pressed the roll of silver into her palm. He stared directly into her pretty blue eyes, taking in every inch of her as if he could see himself being with her. Was this real? A woman being with her husband? She had come back from the market? He watched his hands lift her dress, he saw her panties disappear between her thighs, and then he heard her gasp when he touched them. He watched her pussy clench as he touched it.</p> <p>"My goodness," he heard her say, "you didn't think they were real?"</p> <p>He smiled. The grin he saw on her face was worth so much in her eyes that he could even see into her soul. "No," he told her.</p> <p>"What's yours?" she asked.</p> <p>"Mine," he told her.</p> <p>His voice broke her trance like a spell. She smiled and leaned forward, her hips coming apart more as her dress parted to reveal her panties. She held them to his eyes. He touched them to his lips. He smelled her pussy scent. He liked it. It made his dick react.</p> <p>They both looked up at the sky. They sat there for a moment as if they were at a concert or something. He was about to go back to the store or pick up some other customer, but he stood up before her. He watched her walk up to him. He saw in her eyes how much she meant to him. She would never be alone with him any matter.</p> <p>He placed hands on her thighs and pulled up her panties to expose her pussy. As he held her panties to his face her panties slid down her legs. He smelled her pussy. He knew how to taste her pussy. His lips parted as he inhaled and tasted her. He felt her hands on his head and she guided me his mouth.</p> <p>When his lips touched her pussy it was enough. She gasped as he licked her in front this man who would love only to lick his wife for hours. He wanted her. He wanted to lick her clit and make her orgasm with passion. She moaned and writhed as he tasted her. She felt as if her heart would burst at this point.</p> <p>He was right. He felt her cum. He was surprised to discover the woman had just fucked her husband. She was a natural. He smiled as he looked up in her eyes. He was so very proud of him. He loved to please women.</p> <p>He stood up and walked to the windows. She saw that he had stopped before her. She saw him pick up a bag and walk quickly to the back. He sat down at a desk and set the bag down, but he did not put it on the floor but on the floor where it was sitting. She didn't see the bag. He picked it up and looked inside. Inside was folded down and she saw a white envelope with something written on one side. "Do you want to know?" she asked him.</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"Because," he told her. "I love it when you look at it." He turned to face her, leaned forward and opened the front of her panties. Her eyes looked up expectantly, and she reached down to feel him. They were moist.</p> <p>"Take off your panties," he told her as he touched himself. There was a small, insignificant taste. "I want to kiss them."</p> <p>She looked over at some boxes that were still standing on the edge of the window and opened them as if her mind was a part of the room. She looked at him and closed them up. She felt so horny.</p> <p>They kissed for a long and long time. He pulled down her panties and felt that small part of her body between them. She gasped as he sucked on her pussy. Her body quivered as he sucked on her. She pulled him on top of her. He put his cock on her pussy. Up inside of her pussy and out, moving in and out, in and out of her pussy. He pushed it against her clit and she made a ways her legs shook and she opened wider.</p> <p></p> <p>he felt her body go higher. He felt himself inside of her legs and he made her body to go and then he found another woman. He made her body he felt the whole—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
