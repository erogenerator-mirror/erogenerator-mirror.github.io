How was your new favorite star quarterback?”</p> <p>“It was good,” she replied. “We were in love at first, but there were a million times better things that can come in a relationship than two people getting ready to fuck.”</p> <p>We had known June since her mother left, and her mother always said we were in love.”</p> <p>”That I was!” she added. “But, if I were in your position, it would never be like it was.”</p> <p>”I could never be in your position, June.”</p> <p>“Me neither,” she laughed. “You should never be in my position!”</p> <p>Her mother started walking to the door. “Don’t go. There’s no sense in you coming with me, now.”</p> <p>My mom closed the door behind her and pulled me to her with a kiss. That kiss took my breath away. ”But why don’t you come with me?” she implored without batting an eye. “You don’t have to keep going, it’ll be fun.”</p> <p>”You know you need to, June,” I quipped. “But let’s get out of here.”</p> <p>We got out of the car, and she started rubbing her body against mine while grabbing my crotch. “You’re a sweetheart, aren’t you?” she asked while rubbing my crotch. “And so am I,” I assured her.</p> <p>“You’re such a boy, Justin.”</p> <p>”I’m your boy, Mrs. Martin.”</p> <p>”Oh, I know. But we should be alone.”</p> <p>“We shouldn’t, I’m your mother.”</p> <p>”But you do.”</p> <p>“So be it!” she replied while kissing me again. “Let’s get out of there. It will be fun.”</p> <p>“Don’t be scared, June. There’s no risk of us going anywhere.”</p> <p>“We’m not scared, but I am.”</p> <p>”Then lets do it.”</p> <p>She unbuckled my pants before reaching into my shorts. I was already hard from just having her caressing my cock under her skirt, but she wrapped her hand around my throbbing member. She massaged me with one hand while sucking on my dick with the other. She was able to slide her lips around it without getting much pressure, and I immediately groaned. I couldn’t contain my excitement, all the excitement of us going to the movie and having sex on my first day of college, it’s like a dream.</p> <p>”Oh, you’re so beautiful,” she said as she stroked me. “You have such a beautiful cock. It’s all that I need.”</p> <p>“You just have to say something for me before you stop this.”</p> <p>She stopped with her lips firmly wrapped around the head, slowly taking it in, letting her tongue lick the tip of my cock. Then she licked the sides with her tongue. I watched in awe as she licked my cock, feeling her tongue and mouth caressing me. She held her breath while licking the underside of my cock, taking more of me into her mouth with each stroke of her lips. I was totally in her grasp, she had control of my body under her. Her tongue teased me, stroked me. Each time I had to fight with my willpower. That part was hard. I wanted to just lie there, feeling the pleasure the pleasure from being with her.</p> <p>”Oh,” I breathed to her. “I’m gonna cum in your mouth…!”</p> <p>”Then take your sweet time,” she said before sucking me even harder, almost making me shoot a load down her throat.</p> <p>She sucked me for another minute, then she pulled away from me with an obscene look on her face. Her lips glistened in the moonlight. I wasn’s shining. Her teeth and looking, as she was biting me. My lust. With my precum, she was glist, giving me, but more than sucking me. just on the lips licking her just my cock. “yes, his cock. my cock, he, my—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
