After the initial feeling of disappointment and discomfort, Jane smiled and said, "Well, we'll have that soon enough. Don't you worry, they will be ready soon!"</p> <p>The young men nodded with satisfaction and laughed as the older man began to slowly pump his thick cock in and out of Jane's cunt. Their own cocks were rock hard as they watched him penetrate her with a steady pace. As one, Bill eagerly reached for her nipples as she wrapped her hands around his waist and pulled him towards her, their hips began to meet. She thrust her hips forward at the same time, impaling herself hard on Bill's cock. "Oh fuck!" he exclaimed and he held her tight as she shuddered to her strongest orgasm yet. The two men groaned, each of them pushing hard against the other's erection as their cocks emptied their scrotum.</p> <p>The couple lay on the dining-room table as they recovered their breath. "That was nice," said Bill.</p> <p>"It was... amazing," replied Jane.</p> <p>"Yeah," agreed Bill. "I don't think I should do it again until my wife gets married, and I should have done this for my wife."</p> <p>"You know you shouldn't!" said Jane. "But I have to. I feel guilty about fucking you at the time, but I just feel so horny right now," Bill said and grinned at the look of lust on her face.</p> <p>"Yeah, I feel guilty," agreed Bill. "Doing what you do for a living is sexy, in a different way, and a lot better than my marriage. But I still feel guilty, being that way." He got up on his knees, pulled Jane with him towards him and began kissing her.</p> <p>Jane was surprised, but quickly became aroused again as their lips and tongues probed each other's mouths, tasting each other, enjoying them, and relishing their own sexual arousal. As they kissed, Bill's fingers found her nipples and began to massage the hard little nubs. It made her body tingle with pleasure. Jane could feel her sexual arousal building. Her nipples began to stand up, and as they got harder, she rubbed herself harder against the hardness of Bill's erection. Their passion was intense, building steadily to a crescendo of sensation that made the two of them moan with satisfaction.</p> <p>Suddenly, Jane felt pressure on her back and knew that Bill had turned her around so that she was lying face down on the breakfast table. She felt his hand grab hold of her breasts and begin to rub her nipples. It felt so good to have her breasts massaged in the rough, cold hands. As she began to lift her butt up off the breakfast table, she felt Bill's strong hands encircle her waist, and he began to lift her butt up and down as if she was lifting her.</p> <p>Suddenly, Jane felt Bill's strong hands pressing her panties to one side so that her vagina felt the cool air on her already moist pussy. Her pussy was wet from their previous activities and she wanted to feel Bill's dick inside her right then and there. She could feel Bill's balls pressing against her ass. They both seemed lost in the moment, and as Jane looked at him, Bill looked down to the sight of her exposed pussy. She could see the glistening wetness of her aroused lips. Jane knew what she wanted to do.</p> <p>Still holding her by the waist, Bill began to roll her hips so that his cock pushed against her pussy again and again. His hands grabbed her ass cheeks, squeezed them and spread them apart as his body held hers close to the edge of the table. Jane squealed with excitement as his penis pushed against her. Her pussy lips began to separate and the tip of Bill's penis pushed against her opening before opening and rubbing against her clitoris. His hands were firmly on top of her ass, so that his fingers remained there. He pulled her ass up as firmly as he could, his penis moved forward, making her pussy lips parted, allowing only the tip of his cock to enter her. The sensation of his penis rubbing against her, and the pressure it put on her genitals made her body wriggle and arch with excitement and sensation. She wanted him inside her.</p> <p>To her surprise, she felt her vaginal muscles grip him with pleasure. She knew what she wanted, and a moment later, his penis was inside her. She couldn't believe how good it felt. She felt stuffed and impossibly full. She thought her pussy would explode as his cock began to push through her wet hole, stretching it in and her vagina, and almost ripping her entire opening wide apart. She wanted more, but could feel his penis fill her with his man, and her own cock, but not being inside her love and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
