It went well enough at first. Sometimes she</strong> thought she would like a place where the earth's sun was clear and a place where she could breathe. But La Petite had not believed in her life and she was so damned happy to be there, the day that she wanted to live again in happiness, it was the day of all the other people, the moment when she looked up and saw them, the day when she wished she had seen the sky.</p> <p>In other words, she was there. She had known this day for so many years. This day when she'd make herself come up from her own life in search of fame, fame, fame, fame.</p> <p>So La Petite was in love and she loved nothing more than to live this dream of glory. She knew that it was not her dream to be with someone in that way. It was not her dream to be with another person, no, La Petite was the one that everyone called beautiful, and she was that person.</p> <p>So La Petite found herself in a small, dark-haired man's club named the Pink Palace, looking around.</p> <p>She saw a large, well-lit room that looked to have a dance floor under it, but in truth it was very dark and her body was so tired from all the people dancing that she did not notice. Most of them did not even notice La Petite, she thought, but at least they saw who La Petite was.</p> <p>La Petite could not even see the man inside the club, but he was obviously a man of large proportions and La Petite did not dare to make a sound in case he heard her.</p> <p>La Petite felt her eyes being read by the large, greenish-blue lights which filled the small dance floor, and she smiled at the man who was standing next to her.</p> <p>But the man in blue was not the man in blue. Behind him stood a woman who seemed to be some time in her late fifties, dressed in tight-fitting clothing and a big smile on her face. She appeared almost in tears and La Petite did not even notice her.</p> <p>"Welcome to my club! Welcome! You must be La Petite, La Petite!" said the woman.</p> <p>Her full, red lips were slightly parted and her big, pale eyes looked even more beautiful in the dark. She was wearing a tight, revealing, short, white, skirt that almost hung to the floor and her top was a white, lacy, see-through, bra. It looked tiny on her body. La Petite's eyes were riveted on the woman. She was tall and slender, the body of a woman.</p> <p>Her face was still painted red, although she had put a black ribbon down on the front of her forehead. From La Petite's vantage, La Petite could tell that the woman was a woman of wealth, real wealth. La Petite thought she felt a twinge in her stomach as La Petite's vision was cut off.</p> <p>Her face was pretty, too, but the look in those gorgeous, brown eyes of hers was unmistakable. That stare, that stare of the woman on La Petite meant something in La Petite's heart.</p> <p>The woman, La Petite assumed, was called Nellie. La Petite's first impression was clear when she first saw the woman.</p> <p>Nellie's face was gorgeous. Her brownish brown eyes were alluring with high-pitched, high-pitched cries of joy and La Petite's lips tingled in pleasure as she noticed La Petite looking at her intensely and the girl began to laugh.</p> <p>The girl was so cute! La Petite had always known that the pretty, pink face of every woman was very sexy. La Petite thought that she should not be smiling at that woman, smiling at her sweet, red lips, smiling at her face. But La Petite's smile was so dazzling, so wonderful, so irresistible that La Petite found herself wanting her to keep smiling, to make up for her mischievous smile.</p> <p>So La Petite decided to get used to her gaze at the beautiful woman. To try to see who else La Petite was in her life.</p> <p>La Petite was so surprised to see La Petite, she was in awe, awe that she thought there was someone like the girl La Petite had once been. But La Petite thought that she could get lost in the woman and La Petite smiled, smiling.</p> <p>"I see you're finally making friends," said the woman, "I feel so very privileged! Thank you so much!"</p> <p>The woman was obviously surprised to see La Petite there. Maybe she was the one of a friend she was not her friend, this very special. La Petite could not La petite.</p> <p>La Petite did not speak, spoke La friend's wish to speak La Petite, La Petiteâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
