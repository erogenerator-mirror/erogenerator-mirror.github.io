Maximilian</h4><p><strong>Villefort rose, half-ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of grief. The terrible office he had held for twenty-five years had succeeded in making him more or less than</strong> the average CEO in years, though by the way he was more or less a retired government accountant, he had no right to complain about the new, improved and expanding fortunes of his company.</p> <p>With him, the company had grown exponentially. Even when things had slowed, they had remained the best of friends. And, as a result, he had learned more about the company than about his own company and who he was. He had met his first boss, the president of the company; she was already an account assistant, had already been hired and had managed a decent promotion. Now a dozen years later he had taken over, the new boss was a tall, dark-haired woman of about fifty, and as soon as they started to speak, they each had become quite a new kind of friend. He had even met his new boss before.</p> <p>Now, after the shock of being brought forward, and having to go through it the second time, Villefort found himself trying to put his self-confidence back in a more acceptable frame of reference. He was twenty-five now, but his new boss was much younger. She was much taller than his boss, and her breasts were a bit larger than he had guessed. Her cleavage was even better, though. The older woman had a slightly wild look in her eyes.</p> <p>"A little early." His boss said, as if unaware, as she approached him.</p> <p>Villefort stood, unbuttoning his shirt as his shirt slid off his chest. She grinned. Her eyes were fixed on him, like she could not believe she was doing this. She reached out her hand and wrapped it around his. He put his arm around her, holding tightly against her bare back. She leaned against his body, her head almost touching his chest. The two women were making a beautiful, young couple. Her breasts pressed up against his chest, and her head rested on his shoulder. It made Villefort feel much better.</p> <p>"Thank you." He said.</p> <p>"Any time, Any place." She agreed. "Your secretary." She said, her breath hot against his ear.</p> <p>"Thank you." He muttered. "We can go again." He added, turning a little more, and looking away.</p> <p>"We can fuck." She whispered, her breath hot against his ear. "We can fuck and eat and have sex on a plane."</p> <p>"I can't believe I'm suddenly hearing this coming." He said as she leaned back against the wall. "I wish we would get married."</p> <p>"I wish there was something you wanted." she whispered.</p> <p>"I wish there was something I wanted." He replied.</p> <p>"You wished there was something there, but you couldn't think of anyone else." She said, her breath hot against him. "And you wished there was someone else on the plane."</p> <p>"Maybe you could think of someone else." Villefort suggested.</p> <p>"Maybe." She said. "I could think of someone else, maybe I could think of someone else." She kissed his neck.</p> <p>"Yeah, maybe. I think I really should." He replied, as his cock responded, his body shivering and his balls tightening, as he turned in her arm.</p> <p>"Mikael." He whispered, his lips meeting hers. "My boss."</p> <p>"Well, he got me fired, for that." She said, her hand sliding under his shirt under his shirt to his upper belly.</p> <p>"He got you fired?" He said, feeling his cock start to swell.</p> <p>"I didn't tell you. I didn't tell him." she said, her hand moving lower and lower over her boss' abs. "Just that we need a job."</p> <p>Villefort wanted to stop her. To call her boss and ask her to work in his private office, but he instead decided to take a chance. He wanted the opportunity to make her feel better. He wanted that perfect smile to spread across her lips, to put her in the mood to enjoy sex as much as he did. As his boss, she had no interest in sex. He loved sex. He had always found it to be a part of his life, but not now. This time, he was prepared to make a decision. He closed his eyes, trying to think of what he would say to his boss if his secretary could fuck him, and then move her legs up to make herself visible.</p> <p>"What's up?" he said. "Is your office closed?"</p> <p>"No, it's open, but not locked." She assured him. "I'll be on duty until ten. She gets back."</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"Oh." Vivienne. Ville? Are you have work." Her face. His boss said.</p> <p>" you? Get back. " She said? You?</p> <p><!-- Iâ€”</p--> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
