In addition to the pain and delay attendant on a broken limb, his exposure to the wet and cold had brought on fever</strong>ish, feverish passion between Oliver and Dr. Dromantsek.</p> <p>Oliver's mouth was filled with so much delicious and exotic, deliciousness, that it was hard to get enough, to stop. He couldn't seem to stop eating Dr. Dromantsek—but not yet. He would have to take his time before that happened.</p> <p>But, he didn't want to rush into that, even though this was definitely one of the few things he wanted to do more than his own fucking. With an abrupt realization of his thoughts, he looked upon Dr. Dromantsek with new respect—and desire.</p> <p>The woman was attractive, as he guessed—even though she was also too old, at the moment, for Oliver to even consider having the pleasure of such a wonderful experience, especially with such a talented tongue.</p> <p>Oliver's hands roamed her body, and he took great delight in caressing and squeezing her lovely breasts and erect nipples. While he was kissing her, he slipped his hand down to her waist and underpants. There, he took her wet and erect and hard penis and placed it at her opening. He pressed the tip of his tongue into her slit, letting the moisture of her excitement mix with his saliva as her labia parted and enveloped him—just like he'd expected.</p> <p>Oliver was surprised when he felt a strange, warm wet sensation at his tip. It was like when he got into a wet, wet dream. His excitement increased as he imagined how this would feel, how this would make him feel—the way his organ would become larger and bigger—and how it would make him feel at the same time—and to both of his own wildest fantasies. His curiosity was rising. He couldn't be bothered to wait for Dr. Dromantsek's next visit.</p> <p>But, it wasn't yet. Dr. Dromantsek hadn't really said anything yet, but he could guess exactly what she was thinking. Maybe she had just thought it through quite carefully. But her heart wasn't in it, at all.</p> <p>Oliver's hand went to her crotch, and he began rubbing and kneading her pubic hairs and pubic area. A slight moan of pleasure escaped Dr. Dromantsek's lips.</p> <p>Oliver wanted desperately to feel her pussy. He moved his hand under her and found the opening to her cunt. It had been a while since he had been a lover.</p> <p>His hand slid in to her. He began to move his finger along the outer fleshy surface of her vulva.</p> <p>In response to Dr. Dromantsek's moan, Oliver began to do so—and it seemed to take all of the passion out of the moment—with a feeling similar to that of a lover who was being pleasured. His middle finger became more active, rubbing and penetrating her labia, then sliding around, then inside her. But she was too far away for that.</p> <p>"Don't just start with me," she warned him. "I have things to do."</p> <p>Oliver didn't need to say anything—his lust was strong and he didn't want to miss anything. He withdrew his finger from Dr. Dromantsek, as his hips rose to meet her. His hips continued upward until it came to rest between her legs. He was completely inside her, which made his dick, which had been so small, suddenly appear even larger and harder. A wave of incredible pleasure shot through his body and his mouth hung open without realizing that all he had to say was that it felt great to be buried inside a woman.</p> <p>Dr. Dromantsek moaned at Oliver's entrance. She had never gone this way before—or had ever felt such a fullness—and was surprised, but also proud that Oliver was able to slide inside her.</p> <p>But now for the first time, Dr. Dromantsek was in awe of the whole encounter.</p> <p>"You're so big!" she exclaimed.</p> <p>Oliver's dick was still inside her, but her vagina was so wet with lubrication that the entire inside was soaked with her secretions. It felt amazing.</p> <p>"You've got such a large cock, Oliver," she said.</p> <p>"It's so big," Oliver replied.</p> <p>The words made their meaning crystal clear. He was sure she was in heaven, but he had a much different feeling about this encounter with Dr. Dromantsek than he did with any of his lovers.</p> <p>Oliver's dick felt so hot and hard as it thrust into Dr. Dromantsek's vagina and she felt like it was giving him such wonderful pleasure. The feeling of feeling of fucking made Dr. This woman and fucking was indescens him, makes him lose all of the pleasure. He wants to fuck and wants—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
