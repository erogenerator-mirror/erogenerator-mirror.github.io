The cook-shop was in a bad way. Thanks to the traveller’s fifty-seven francs, Thénardier had been</strong> a guest lecturer at Calcutta University in Sydney for five years. Unfortunately, the university was still stuck in a dismal business-class slough and the food shortage was so high that it was now just a soup kitchen of all the foodstuff and no help could be sent to the restaurant because of the over-budgetness of the food industry. Thénardy was in the process of finding a replacement at the university as an adjunct professor. It was only because he never left the university because of his student-athleteship that he could make enough of a big difference for the poor slough as well as the students.</p> <p>He had found a substitute professor from a neighbouring university as an interim chair in his department. Although a good student he made in his first two years of teaching his children's history and literature had become less and less popular. It was a pity that they had no trouble finding such nice students, but the poor student-athleteship had become so unpopular that there had been rumours that the University was not ready to accept those who would be required to teach English children history and literature by having the education for reading history. However, it looked like Thénardy might have been able to find help. He had also found an alternate professor from the local junior college. He was still a little unsure how he should proceed but he had learned to love life with family and friends.</p> <p>Thénardy had to leave to go home as he needed to work a night and he was in no hurry. There was nothing to do that night especially when a good teacher could help him to solve his research problem. However, on the third evening in a row, he looked at the clock and realised that it was still almost eight o'clock in the evening. He smiled to himself and went to his bedroom and locked the door. The rest rooms of the house could be open, he decided. He quickly put on a t-shirt and khakis and opened the balcony door. A woman was walking in her car and she was carrying a pile of papers. He quickly stepped inside the house. There were two men standing around. They were young and young, but none of them were as handsome as the man who had brought them their papers and they looked as if at the very least they would have had a go on them. The young man looked up at Thénardy as if he had just come from some god-damned secret. He spoke to him very little, which, considering they were young guys, he guessed would be hard to understand with the woman's body. However, the voice could not have meant anything to either of their faces, the expressions were so young and the eyes so dark.</p> <p>He turned to face the two men and said, "Hi, you've got papers for me," he said, giving the woman a very suggestive wink, "Do you know where they are?"</p> <p>Thénardy said, "They are in my study room."</p> <p>The young man said that she was very beautiful, very thin and small tits too, "And I don't know whether they are real or fake that they are on a woman but I can see them and I can see they are perfect."</p> <p>"Well thanks," Thénardy said, "they are real but they are so small that they look like they wouldn't be big enough. They are so round that I wouldn't even dream of them being real."</p> <p>He quickly reached around and cupped one of his big breasts in one of his hands, then he bent and gave the woman a light kiss on her lips. The woman responded with a very happy kiss. He felt the woman's body responding to his advances and after a couple of exchanges of a few seconds, she pulled away. He kissed her again and she responded to him by opening her mouth and kissing him. They kissed for few seconds and he felt warm and smooth, like warm wet silk. At last he broke off the kiss. "I have homework for tomorrow," he said, "But you might want to keep it light."</p> <p>The girl was obviously tired, she replied, "Oh no. What do I need to do? I can manage it."</p> <p>"No I will help."</p> <p>"Okay," she said and then said, "Can I buy you a cup of tea? Or, maybe you could find something else for me?"</p> <p>The young man said, "Yes I would like that. I cannot afford some tea for myself."</p> <p>The girl stood there for a moment, then said, "I am sure that my boyfriend has an idiot of finding you an idiot friend would have me a cup of some tea."</p> <p>And walked out of him in to her in her study room.</p> <p>to her.</p> <p>his room that were his.</p> <p>he had and to him. she walked.</p> <p>and to—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
