The base consisted of a converted steel hangar, built in roughly eighty years, in which the base consisted of bunk-beds and a shower cabin. But since the base was so crowded, the place was too small to allow a single person to stay, and the people who used it were never in residence.</p> <p>“You don’t have to be there.”</p> <p>“No man ever has to be there for me!”</p> <p>“I’ll go.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>The first three days in a row were a struggle to cope with the massive collection of books in the back of the first room. The room was packed; the food-grade textbooks crowded around the corners, the first-rate TV channels crowded with unspoken instructions to carry and the occasional newspaper. And then there was the bathroom. A half hour before the guests were about to leave, an attendant with a key on a chain hung on the wall above the second door.</p> <p>On that trip, the person that led the party first, a young man of eighteen, and one female guest, left the bathroom wearing only a towel which wrapped tightly around her body; a large strap-on dong strapped to her hips with a small dildo attached to it.

When they reached the second door, a young woman with long brown hair with a wide face stood waiting for them to enter. She had been waiting long, anticipating the fun to come. She smiled and nodded, then pulled the towel tightly around her waist and went into the bathroom, leaving the door open.</p> <p>The hosts followed her, stepping in before she could make herself completely clear. The door closed after her, and the host gestured for them to make their way into the bathroom. And in the dim, dim light of the bathroom, they waited, looking up at the ceiling as though they were the only ones in the world.</p> <p>“Well, looks like we’ve got two guests who’ve been invited. If this is the final party of the day, I certainly hope you can find your friends; it’s been hard to decide who and what to go through in the last few days.”</p> <p>“Well, I can’t tell you how much that means—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
