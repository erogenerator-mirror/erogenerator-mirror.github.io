Whatsoever is expedient unto thee, O World, is expedient unto me;</h4><p><strong>nothing can either be ’unseasonable unto me, or out of date, which unto thee is seasonable. Whatsoever thy seasons bear, shall ever by me be esteemed as happy fruit, and</strong> the sun to be good for thee. It is not to be, as is seen by nature, but as it is in those days of spring, when it is as the sun in its full glory."</p> <p>She then placed the head of my cock between her thighs, and without hesitation said: "I will give it up; not on your terms, but in my heart. I will not take it from you, or leave it in, or leave your hand where it may be but a little." Then with that she put her palm on my belly and held it in her hand like a little spoon.</p> <p>Now the next question asked my mind. I don't know why, and I was wondering how she could possibly take her hand out without putting her hand against my cock. I had never been very adventurous with a woman, and to be the first to admit that, had that happened, I probably wouldn't have felt that kind of needy way. I'd had sex with other men, but I never felt that way. That was why I had so many feelings for her. But how could she take it from me? I couldn't. With the way the girl had acted, I would be in for an experience with her again. That's what it was to me, the feeling of a man being in love with his woman. I had no desire to have sex with any other man at the moment, but the prospect intrigued me.</p> <p>I let her know when I would answer her, and that then she could continue.</p> <p>She started by giving me some lather, and after a few minutes of her rubbing her hands, I was getting an erection. It's not unusual to get an erection when being with other women. I'm not a huge fan of it, however, as I was a bit of a nerd myself. As she worked on me with her hands, I was getting very aroused at the same time. She was making me harder and harder by rubbing her hands along my erection with her hands. I don't know why, but it seemed to be natural that I should be attracted to her, and I have to admit that she was not to be the only one affected by this.</p> <p>"Are you sure you like that," she asked?</p> <p>"Oh yes, very much," I said. My cock was growing in her hands by the second. She moved up and down along the length; I could feel the blood was rushing into the head of it. It was like she was pumping a fire engine on me. I'm not normally shy about being gay, but this was a big step toward a new world of sex.</p> <p>"Do it again," she commanded. "This time, it's not so much to get over you, as to make me ready to go again."</p> <p>She kept rubbing her hands on my shaft, getting me even harder. When she reached the base, she slid her hands up again to the head and back down to the base again. Then she put them around me like a spoon and started pumping. Every time she squeezed it, I thought that if I was going to have my first sex with a woman, I was going to have to go for a second one, too. Her grip tightened, and she pumped faster.</p> <p>I was getting more and more aroused with her hands rubbing along my pole. I was afraid that if we continued like that, I would get really aroused. She could feel it in my cock.</p> <p>"I want you to come, honey," she moaned. I wanted to tell her to stop, that I wouldn't be able to help, but my cock was at the point where it could no longer take it. I grabbed her hips and gave her what must have been a pleading look. She looked up and smiled as she leaned forward and put her lips to my knob. I could feel the pressure of her lips on my cockhead as she sucked it into her mouth.</p> <p>"Oh God," I muttered, "Oh God, don't stop."</p> <p>She continued to lick and suck on my head, which was getting more sensitive as she sucked. I grabbed my ass cheeks with both hands trying to pull her up. With each pull of her lips, I could feel the hot spit that was starting to run along the sensitive head of my cock. Every time she pulled her mouth off me, her tongue would flick over the head of my cock, while her other hand kept rubbing the base of my cock. The stimulation was just too strong. I closed my eyes in order to see her, as she would take me deep into her mouth and then slow down. I could feel her tongue flicking along the underside of my cock as she sucked, and her hand would rub along my shaft up and down.</p> <p></p> <p>She looked up at me as I felt the way she was looking. "You can feel my cock sliding in her tongue. Does she could see it on you as I feel as—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
