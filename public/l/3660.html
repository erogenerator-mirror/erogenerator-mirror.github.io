You mean... I don't mean the present day. It's only been a few weeks. And, I don't know if I can... we're going to be... like... I mean...."</p> <p>"And we will."</p> <p>"Okay. I'll get you some clothes," he said, as Mr Shepherd slipped into his jacket and they made their way to the train station a short distance away. "It's not so far, is it? I can't believe..."</p> <p>"Nonsense. It's good for a different kind of exercise."</p> <p>At the station, Mr Shepherd's mind wandered back to his encounter with that young lady in his study. His fingers flickered over his desk chair and his mind wandered back to her body, when the Professor had first introduced him to her. Was it only when he had first asked her out when he would have done her... she was a new student at the time. He would have to ask her again about it.</p> <p>Sensing she had not come with him, they sat in his study, where he turned the chair so they could both get up. When he glanced over at her he began to stammer. "I'm sorry."</p> <p>"Why? You thought you would like to have had me as a partner?"</p> <p>"No." The Professor's mind was filled with the images of what he had said as he had taken her hand, when he had looked at her in the reflection of the mirror. His hand felt good in her hand. She smiled at him, and as he rose to his feet, he looked up at her. As the students walked back to the hallway, he whispered. "If you would like to stay." It wasn't a request. She just nodded and he followed her through the hall, down the stairs and into his own study. He went into the study first, where he closed the door after Mr Shepherd entered. He then sat on one of the chairs, and looked her over as he sat behind his desk. She looked at him as she undid her buttons.</p> <p>"Why don't you come and sit on one of the chairs?" he asked her, knowing from reading his mind that she would not understand this.</p> <p>"Umm, sure. Why not?" Her smile was one of excitement.</p> <p>"I'm going to need some clothes on." Mr Shepherd was already moving his hand up her leg until it rested on her thigh.</p> <p>"Well, then, let's take off the clothes we're wearing and get on the bed." She slipped off her jacket, and after tossing it over the back of the chair, she undid her blouse. She dropped her jacket to the floor and unclasped her bra, and in a few seconds her large boobs were exposed, which Mr Shepherd was pleased to note. He stared as she pulled her blouse halfway over herself, and she let it drop to the floor as well, as she slid her hands out of her skirt, tossing it with it. Mr Shepherd looked on in amazement. He had not realized she had just worn some clothes on, but he had felt a warmth that he didn't know he could feel. Mr Shepherd had to admit that he had never seen her this sexy before, which was a first. He had wondered if there might be some kind of a thing they could do in their own study, maybe even to find out. When he remembered that she had said a few times that she hadn't worn panty-hose, his erection had increased in size as he thought of what he might do with her there.</p> <p>"What's with you, Mr Shepherd?" she asked him as she came slowly toward him. She slipped off her skirt, and he saw what he had meant about being careful. She had on a skimpy French maid's outfit, and it had a plunging neckline that showed her breasts quite a bit and showed a fair amount of cleavage. Her nipples were small and erect, and he could see her areolas, which were covered with light brown fur. He felt a surge in his groin as his lips opened to reveal his desire.</p> <p>She unzipped him pants and slipped them off, and slowly peeled them off. Then suddenly she was on her back on the bed, sitting up on her elbows.</p> <p>"Hurry, Mr Shepherd!" she said with an exaggerated pout.</p> <p>Mr Shepherd quickly complied, and after slipping his underwear off, he climbed on top of her and plunged the head of his penis deep into her belly. She wrapped her legs around him and they started making love. In only a few minutes of lovemaking, Mr Shepherd was already on the brink. He reached into the nightstander's nightstander's dresser's closet, and took his finger and started to find her moist, and remove Mr Shepherd's her panties, when he found his other clothes, what heâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
