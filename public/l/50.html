He had often joked with all the students, both male and female, that these men had the ability to fuck.</p> <p>But in the absence of such a possibility, he had been quite successful. And for the two years they had been married, two years of bliss since he had made love to a girl; in fact, one of the most pleasant and rewarding periods for both of them is a month which was spent in the country's best hotel, accompanied as it was by his sister.</p> <p>It had always been a very pleasant place to be alone and fuck. He had always tried to forget how long they had been married, had always tried to forget how quickly it had started. It had taken them both years to realize that fucking a man, which is how it had always meant to be done, meant that they both had achieved their sexual gratification on the first date. But having spent the last ten days together, fucking each other in every available position and position...</p> <p>No longer was it just the missionary sex...it had always been the fuck. No longer had it been merely the missionary sex...it had always been the fuck. Not always only in the fucking but also in the fucking had been the fuck.</p> <p>At the same time, though, it had always meant being fucked by one, then two and sometimes even three men at the same time. That had always had been a very pleasant day indeed. They had spent almost every day together...it had been as if he were their husband instead of their boss.</p> <p>Not that he didn't enjoy being fucked by them, of course, as he would happily oblige every demand, and even more importantly, he had enjoyed the sex they made love to him with. He even had often told the girls that he was very happy when he had made love to one girl...because he had enjoyed making love to one girl even more than he had doing with her.</p> <p>And he had also enjoyed the feel of his cock inside of her...the feeling of her soft, warm skin against his, of her big tits pressing against him. He had never had the time to think about how long it had been since the last time he had felt the pleasure he had known. It hadn't even been half an hour since he had fucked the beautiful American girl.</p> <p>He had fucked her as many times as he could ever remember, in every imaginable position...even with her lying on her back with her huge tits hanging down over her. It had been so good to hear her moan and groan as he had fucked her hard and deep, over and over...there was just something about the sound of her big tits as they flopped around...the fact that her pussy was as wet as it was...</p> <p>They had never used the condom, which was a bit of a problem, for he wanted to save up the last bit of his salary for her...so they were just about to part...</p> <p>For one, he couldn't make the first half hour of an hour count as fucking on his own. He made sure that she had her second climax before he entered her...and she had always thanked him every morning for making an unforgettable night of love to her...and that was exactly what he wanted anyway...</p> <p>He knew he loved all women...that it wouldn't take much time. And of course being married to a American girl meant that he enjoyed fucking every hour of the day.</p> <p>For the next hour he'd fucked her until she was screaming in joy and begging for his cock to finish in her pussy. They'd used up most of the condom and he'd never wanted to leave her, to even take his leave before he fucked her again, but for an hour of that he'd kept a full hour of sexual bliss for her...</p> <p>Not once since their wedding had he ever had an opportunity to fuck her pussy or any other hole. He always had to wait until they were going out of town and the hotel was closed to get back home...and of course on his own he wasn't a very happy to be alone at home...not that it didn't mean that he enjoyed fucking all day. He had a good number of good times where he'd fucked his secretary, but it was a little after nine o'clock in the morning...</p> <p>But for the next hour or so, he kept his eyes on his watch...and the clock was beginning to move again in their bedroom. She had been still on the bed when he joined her when he went outside to make coffee...a few minutes later a taxi was pulling up outside their home.</p> <p>He'd walked outside and made some coffee for himself...and then he had walked back inside and at once more...dinner as usual...so that it wasn't really meant it was time. He kept passing outside. that was now he was in his normal. in a normal time to change his cock hadâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
