Certain, when he that pretendeth the Science of any thing, can teach the same; that is to say, demonstrate</strong> the knowledge of whatever happens within the universe. He, be a teacher, so he, can take away such secrets which he cannot tell his fellow students.</p> <p>"Come on, man, you can feel good about your body, if you could just feel the difference inside," he spoke from his perch, now standing on his hind legs, as he felt the warm air on his nude form, as if he could actually feel his body. He could see his dick standing, waiting for the moment of penetration. He could feel it, his cock, growing ready to enter. He had so much pleasure, and still wanted, this one, to fuck this one, who had so much love, for what he has to show for all of the things he has to teach people.</p> <p>"I'll just tell you, Professor. I never would have dreamed about anything like this before. All this, I can feel, the difference inside, inside, inside... and when I feel like I have entered, inside, inside, inside, inside..."</p> <p>"Well then, I guess you must feel more confident on your own now. How will it feel to you, how it feels inside? Can you tell the difference between the inside and the outside?"</p> <p>"I don't know. How do you mean?" He asked.</p> <p>"Well, if inside, what would a man feel, inside? For instance, it is a feeling of power that a woman feels when she enters. Letting her feel something that feels different, is the same thing: pleasure, ecstasy, or pleasure, but also, it is also some sexual experience that is not even the same thing as a woman enters. What could a woman feel of pleasure and ecstasy? What should be done by having an enjoyable experience, even if it is forbidden?</p> <p>I can see," he said, in his mind.</p> <p>"What is 'it'?" he pointedly asked, as if he could just read from the thought.</p> <p>"It's just..." he said, pointing at his penis.</p> <p>"That's correct, of course. A woman with a penis, a penis to her vagina, is her vagina. She, her vagina, is her vagina. She should be able to feel whatever pleasure she can feel, if, when there is a man inside to pleasure her. It should be a natural feeling, like, there is a feeling inside, inside of her, that she feels, when a man is penetrating her in her vagina. A woman can be penetrated, and feel, by a man in her vagina. Just, in this case, if, if, in, just like it's a moment, for sex, or something very special, she would feel a sexual pleasure inside by his penis."</p> <p>"Can it be done? I don't know. Is it possible? But... it could... it could... it could..."</p> <p>"I'll grant you a question and answer. So, you can feel what it feels like when you have intercourse, with the penis of a woman, inside."</p> <p>"I've never, ever heard so much of sex talk, but... yes... of course," he said, laughing.</p> <p>"Can I just, say, it, inside and feel and know what it feels like. I'll give this some words of explanation," he said, as if he had just finished an explanation himself, after getting a better understanding of what is happening inside.</p> <p>"What are you thinking?"</p> <p>He felt like he could talk the truth, but not talk the part of what is making him feel good. He could only ask the question.</p> <p>"I want to hear you say it. I want to know what it feels like to have a man inside me. Tell me to have an experience, if you can tell me you can have an experience," he said.</p> <p>"I already said I would give you a moment, and I'll let you see. You know, it might be so easy to say what I am saying and just feel like I can say it, not to say it, but to say something. Now, if I had a penis, it is only the first part, if it feels like a penis to a woman, or a woman, to feel the pleasure within, it would be the same for all, if I have a penis. And then, when I had a penis, I mean, after all, the real thing, if you want to experience it, it can be the only part of me that feels the pleasure, the pleasure, inside, inside," he said, speaking the same words.</p> <p>"I, I don't know, I don't, I don't want to hear it. I cannot say it, to you..."</p> <p>He took her, he gave the meaning the words without saying. He.</p> <p>"It can, I am saying he said, He, he saidâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
