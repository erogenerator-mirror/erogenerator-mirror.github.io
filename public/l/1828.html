Remember that all is but opinion and conceit, for those things</h4><p><strong>are plain and apparent, which were spoken unto Monimus the Cynic; and as plain and apparent is the use that may be made of those things, if that which is</strong> thus made is so; by means of means that are plain and obvious. The word fuck may well convey the intent of those who are of either sex, who are either sex, by definition, or that what is so is so by definition is so.</p> <p>For instance a man who has been known to be fuck is so long as he takes his clothes off. For another man who can fuck any way, especially in the presence of God and/or the Holy Ghost, then yes fuck is the word that may have the meaning of, or may be to be fucked, by a man who is a sex God.</p> <p>If a man who is a sex God is to take his clothes off, then he has a very, very impressive cock. He has a pretty large cock, which is so rare, that the average person cannot actually see it. (Cynics do not see it or feel it. The difference is, the more male, you will not see it or feel it. It is only the man you are referring to.) You may well just be asking questions. If someone says to you, "Oh, yeah, I see that your cock is very impressive, but there does not seem to be a very, very large cock." (Cynics, who want, and I mean that they like, to be asked, right?)</p> <p>It's simple, that some people don't know how big, in proportion, of those things to see. You see, even with a very large cock in the presence of God or Spirit, you will be able to see if you are a cock, but if the cock is big, and there really is nothing there, but there really is a very big cock to say and you are not. You are simply, or rather, only able to see the shape and form of those things with the eye. I, in my own experience, have seen quite a large bulge or lump in a man's trousers when he is not looking. That is, when he is looking at your face, which is pretty much the only way that I have seen a man's face when looking at your face. Your eyes are the primary eye part, therefore, of any of your eyes.</p> <p>Even though I have seen many of those things at the hands of the Lord or the Holy Ghost, if it is a man who has a cock, then it is something which we can easily see and see from a distance. Even though most people have never seen or experienced a large, erect, black cock, as a man is a few years older than you, when your eyes are looking at him, I think it's very attractive. Most men think about those things, rather, in general. You may have seen men at the clubs with large, cock, when wearing a skirt. You may be tempted to look past you and see a rather large cock, but your eyes need to be in view.</p> <p>I think it is very sexy that the man in your eyes would be looking at your cock.</p> <p>Women, though not necessarily that of men, as my wife, though quite a bit more sexually active in the world than some men, are so very different and so sexually active in the world. In addition, to the various degrees of sexual activity, a man can be considered to be a "sexual" being. A woman may just take it for granted that a man is, for the most part, asexual, and that I or you can only see the shape and form of some of that sexual being.</p> <p>As well as sex, it is more the sexual side in an encounter. If a man is interested in having sex with you, so be it. But don't be too fond of me if you are a little afraid of the cock, or of me. It is quite possible that I have seen a man's cock before and I know. He and I may be a little alike. If it is a little different, you are very likely to have seen that man, or at least twice with him.</p> <p>If it seems that your eyes are staring at another man's cock, or a man's cock, it could be fun to have fun with, so be it.</p> <p>I think you should be very self-conscious about, if that is the case in such an encounter. If it has happened to you, you should find it very difficult to hide the fact that you have a man's cock in your hand. Just the fact that your eyes are in his hand. Or your body.</p> <p>Do I have to spell out what I'm going to tell you about your body? Do you have to spell out what you're going to tell me about yourself? Do you have to spell out that you body?</p> <p>Sex and Sex God Sex Sex Sex and Jesus/By Paul</p> <p></p> <p>To Jesus and Jesus</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Or Jesus and the Bible By the Lord'sâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
