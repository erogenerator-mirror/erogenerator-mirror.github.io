The others all laughed. Sam reached up and ran his hand over the back of mine. “Do you ever get to be young and strong and go hard?” said he, grinning at those.</p> <p>“Oh, God, yes!” I whispered, nodding my head. “I’m going for number twelve.”</p> <p>“Then let’s go,” said he.</p> <p>“OK,” I said, smiling. Sam slid off his lap as we walked around the table and I got down on all fours near the entrance. I heard the others say a few things, and then Sam pulled his hard-on out through the fly of his zip-tie, his cock hard and thick. His cock was long and thick and smooth…</p> <p>-V -- -</p> <p>Sam led me out into the garden. We passed some trees and a little stream and I said “This way.”</p> <p>Sam led me through to a shady area by the water. Sam sat down on a lawn chair across from mine as I turned back. He was looking down at my wet pussy, which was hanging on a tree. He smiled broadly. “Nice!” Then he looked at me, with that “look at me” thing, “you like what you see?”</p> <p>I didn’t answer. In fact, I just grinned at him and nodded. I ran my fingers over my pussy lips and then dipped down to dip my middle finger into my hole. It was soaked and it was dripping. I looked at Sam and ran my middle finger into my hole. I drew it out and brought it up to my lips. Lick with an “o”. Sam grinned. “Oh, do you think so? Do you want to taste my cum?” I nodded my head.</p> <p>“Good!” he said, “I bet you’re turned on!” Sam stood up and he took his top off and put his cock to my lips, “Suck it, suck it!” I opened my mouth as wide as I could and sucked on it while his hands held the back of my head. I sucked on him as he stroked my hair and his finger held the back of my head.</p> <p>“Oh God, fuck that’s good, suck it, “ Sam said as he moved his cock back and forth along the wetness that was running through me. He slid forward and pushed his cock into my throat. I didn’t gag. I kept my mouth open and his fuck shaft pushed deep into my throat. I held his balls in his hand as he pulled out.</p> <p>“Now you’ve got it nice and wet!” said Sam as he moved up the bench so that his cock could slide down me without him standing on the bench. Sam pushed his cock up to my pussy and I moaned as he slid the head of his cock up and down my slit.</p> <p>“Fuck it, fuck me,” I moaned, “Fuck my pussy, fuck me!” Sam began fucking me very slowly; the cock head in my hole, the cock shaft in my wet pussy, both of us moving on the grass, moving, fucking and fucking. Sam and I made love to each other.</p> <p>I sucked Sam’s cock and fondled his balls as I played with Sam’s balls. I felt his hand stroking my ass and I raised my ass high. Sam had a finger on my ass to help him as he fucked me, feeling my wetness and knowing that he was fucking me with his finger.</p> <p>I was in the middle of a wonderful, passionate cum. We came together, not stopping our fucking, but moving our lovemaking along.</p> <p>Sam and I left to return to our dormitory one afternoon to take some time off. Sam was still looking at my cunt. It was swollen and his cock was hard but not hard enough to fill me.</p> <p>“I’m going to cum,” he said, still looking. “I can’t do either of this.” He came, pushing his hard on into my stomach and I felt the spurts of his seed splashing my chest.</p> <p>“Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,” I breathed, and he pushed his cock into my belly, his spunk shooting up in my belly button. Our bodies were sticky as our excitement flowed through our mutual coupling; our fucking with total abandon.</p> <p>–V – – – - – - – -</p> <p>A –</p> <p>– .</p> <p>.
