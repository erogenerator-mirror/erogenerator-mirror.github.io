The countess, who had long noticed what was</strong> good and what wasn't was happy to be giving a son to the man who was marrying her, Nicholas. She was now her son's lover, and Nicholas was her husband and brother. She was also her new husband's lover. Her love for him, especially his wonderful cock, was a gift she was grateful to him for, and that she was grateful of him for keeping her safe and warm in his arms. They were the best of friends in so many ways, and they shared more than anything. They shared a lot, and a lot could be said because they could share a lot.</p> <p>Since she still had a hard time believing in anything that could be the cause of eternal damnation in the universe; the only thing she could think of is that when she was alive, was she ever going to get the chance to have such a good, hard fuck every night. Even though she had her husband's wonderful cock in her hand and not in another hole, she wanted her son to be her lover every time.</p> <p>And she wanted to keep that promise.</p> <p>"I'm so happy," she told him as they stared at each other. Nicholas smiled widely and hugged her again. They smiled for days until her parents showed up. As her parents and Nicholas and her mother's friends showed up, everyone got to see them, and they all applauded. "Merry Christmas to you, Mom," she said. "Merry Christmas to you."</p> <p>"Happy Christmas to you, son," her parents said. "Merry Christmas to you."</p> <p>When her father introduced her to her parents, they had already exchanged their gifts, and they left her alone with Nicholas until they had left. "Happy Christmas to you, son," she said. "Good night."</p> <p>"Good night, Mom, I love you," Nicholas said as they kissed on the cheek.</p> <p>Her father took a few steps forward, grabbed his mother by the hand, and lifted her up and down on of her naked legs on the sofa. She looked around the room and smiled as her parents followed them.</p> <p>After they got her comfortable on the sofa, they were both on the floor with her father on top of her. They had their arms around her and she looked back at her father and their mother. They were smiling with their eyes glued to her face as she lifted her leg up into a standing position with her father's cock pressing into her pussy.</p> <p>As they both slowly moved their hips in and out, they were fucking each other. It was an experience that she had been waiting for, even though she didn't understand it, until her mother and father were fucking.</p> <p>As they both continued to fuck, she had a feeling as if she wanted to scream. She knew it, but she also knew it wasn't an orgasm. She never thought she would have this feeling. After what her parents did to her, she hoped she would at some point become what she was. She needed to get fucked every single day of her life.</p> <p>After fucking for about eighteen hours, she felt the familiar feeling that she had been waiting for, and that she needed. She wanted to scream and shout "fuck me, fuck me, fuck me" from the ceiling, even though her body could not. And when she finally did feel that feeling, she screamed for hours of pure, raw passion and for all of eternity.</p> <p>"Oh man. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck," she heard herself chanting as the two of them fucked like mad.</p> <p>The only thing she could think of as her world stopped.</p> <p>"Fuck me. Fuck me now," she said to herself in between yelling. And she was glad for it. "Fuck me," she yelled again and again, and she wished she was her son and her daughter.</p> <p>"Oh dear, what am I going to say? Dad? Mom? I want you to fuck me," she said, with pride in her voice. They both chuckled at what they had just said and how good it was.</p> <p>"Oh dear, Mom would love that," her father said.</p> <p>"She should know. She should know, she shouldn't ever have been such a bad daughter. If our daughter doesn't want to fuck me anymore, then what did your parents think?"</p> <p>"I don't know. They would know because I'm their son," her father said.</p> <p>"But if this is what they wanted, I guess I have to agree with them," she said. "You're my son, right?"</p> <p>"Well. Well. Yeah, it's. But I guess so. I guess so," he is. Then he should have to my daughter. He doesn't,"</p> <p>But that's just so and it's what? Oh. Right now that's that you have you just that there's just with me—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
