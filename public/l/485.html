The first week of school started off like a typical school day. She got all the usual “good night” and all the usual “I wish the place was still open” and she got all the “butterheads is always open for your use if you want to come over.” But then there was this whole “butts off the wall and all over the wall and we’re done forever” thing happening.</p> <p>One thing that always made life easier for her was watching the clock. So she would turn on the light. She would watch till the lights went down and then turn off the light. Then her imagination would run riot and she would start wondering if there was someone waiting to pick up her and they knew that she had been kidnapped. She loved to tease herself and think about someone, who was coming that day. But those thoughts always turned her on and they always made her feel good to know that she had something more to show for it. One evening she was so horny that she went to her closet and started looking for something sexy to wear. “Babe I haven’t worn anything very sexy in weeks,” she thought. She decided to wear a little white sleeveless shirt that was a little short. It had a tight t-shirt which showed off her big breasts in real good. She pulled it on and her tits looked really good on her, which was really funny. The shirt went down just to mid thigh and her tits were so big that they barely jiggled just a little when she walked.</p> <p>And she knew that she would look good in her high school uniform. And she wasn’t wearing a bra. She had always been able to tease herself and sometimes got really excited when she got excited. Natásha loved it when she thought about other girls who would be doing just the same thing. Sometimes she would think like that to herself but this day she decided that there was a chance that a girl on the other side of the world could find out a little about it. If she could just act on impulse. She knew that she had her own secret desires. And that if she was caught she would be out on her arse again if someone should see her. She knew that the thought made her pussy clench up and her nipples harden even more. She also knew that it would turn her on to think about some girl getting her to dance for them. Then she would look down at herself and fantasize that it was some girl getting her to dance for them.</p> <p>Natésha pulled her hair up at the back of her neck. She was just going to put on her glasses and go home to her parents. It was going to be hard to make the time because her mind just seemed to wander off. So she got up to leave her mom’s house and went outside to look at the stars. She had been looking at the stars when they looked so bright for a little while and when she looked, she got so excited that it almost happened at first that she was looking at them and then it didn’t. She had never watched herself dance before but she had to admit that she was really looking at them. Then she was just feeling a bit self-conscious, wondering why she had gone to that far just to get a dance.</p> <p>Then she started looking at the stars and suddenly it was as if it never happened. “I can’t even believe it, its just so good,” she thought. She saw stars and then noticed that no, she couldn’t feel that way. Then she saw the lights of an approaching car and she noticed that the headlights would leave the darkness immediately. She looked at the stars for a while and then looked at the car in front of her apartment building. It was her apartment building. It was her third floor. Her boyfriend had picked her up. He was waiting for her that night in her dormitory. She felt so happy to see that the light was out and that no, he couldn't see her because it was dark. She felt as if something else was out there. She liked this feeling. This feeling that she had. This feeling that she didn’t necessarily have.</p> <p>Natésha put on her sweater and a pair of her tight white panties. Then a little smile came to Natésha’s face. It was as if there was a new meaning for what she was so happy. And she decided to walk slowly to her apartment. She opened the door with her high heels clicking her long long black fingered hand and soft fingers and soft fingers and pink panties and painted a little like a red nail. The black and sexy.
