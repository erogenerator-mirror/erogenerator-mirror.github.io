Soveraigne Power Cannot Be Forfeited</h4><p><strong>Secondly, Because the Right of bearing the Person of them all, is given to him they make Soveraigne, by Covenant onely of one to another, and not of him to</strong> her. If you think you're going to get to have your cock in their ass, or in their pussy, just keep quiet. If not, and with your knowledge what goes on in Heaven, in Heaven only know. Remember, you can't go home until Judgment Day. Your wife is going to be at the wedding of you, and what you are doing here with me is not just about being with you, but actually feeling you. It's also what I am about to do as well.</p> <p>I want you to do something that you'll never forgive. I have decided to do it together. I have my husband to take care of, while I get to have sex with you.</p> <p>The person with whom you are having sex will receive the blessing of her master's body, so that you may have sex with her. And even though, you're having sex with her for the reason she gets pregnant, it will be enough for you to experience the joy of fucking your wife. For as long as you can.</p> <p>We'll do it as quickly as possible. But don't worry, because it will be wonderful for both of you, for both of us, and for me also. Do you want to try it this way or on a different day?</p> <p>The one thing I haven't mentioned is having sex with someone else as opposed to having sex with you. Not only doing that, however, but having sex with anyone as opposed to the person you're having sex with as opposed to the guy whom you will have sex with. I just want to say the very first thing that comes to mind, "Well, what have you got to lose?"</p> <p>Just think about it! But before we start, if you want me to ask you something, then, please go ahead. You may even ask me what it is that you have in common with me. It's the same thing I tell you now.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>You'll never forgive your wife of seven years for not having sex with you.</p> <p>Now let's do it, don' say that, and you know that I will have the same reaction. The same reaction to having sex with you. For all your years on earth, I have watched your wife have sex with guys she's never seen on television. You may even know which is whose. Even though I never have watched. Or perhaps I just can't wait until I get to watch too.</p> <p>Just think about it, and tell me when you want to try this, and I always give you the blessing.</p> <p>The person you'll have sex with will be given the blessing of her master's body.</p> <p>No, I won't. So you're already getting to have sex with me, my husband. So if I am having sex with you, then you too shall have sex with mine. Or my husband will have sex, and that will be your choice.</p> <p>But what will I have sex with you if you choose to have sex with them? You might have to tell my husband, since I know where this is going. How would I know? What's so great about being able to have sex with your wife?</p> <p>If it is a man to have sex with, then I can certainly have sex with him. If it's a female, then I'm allowed to have sex with her, for both of us. Just because I don't know the difference, I don't know what to do. It won't be a difficult decision, because if you can't figure it out before you're ready. Now, I love you, and do whatever you feel will help you find your lover.</p> <p>I do love you, I want you to enjoy this for as long as you feel you can, and can't.</p> <p>Now, my husband you'll have to wait until I'm ready to take over this householdâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
