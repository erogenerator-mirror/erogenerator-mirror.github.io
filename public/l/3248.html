English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>XLVII. INVOLUNTARY BLISS.</h4><p><strong>With such enigmas and bitterness in his heart did Zarathustra sail o’er the sea. When, however, he was four day-journeys from the Happy Isles and from his friends, then had</strong> a dream with two ladies, a man, and all three women in love. But, there was an audience. And, now, with the help of Zarathustra they invited him to their castle of Love, the Holy Island of Zarathustra. The love in his heart was eternal, and the lust of a lover's eyes was too powerful. After all, after having a dozen wives and all of their children and their three children, a man and all of their children, and all of their friends, it was a miracle he felt the rest of his body go weak.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>After spending all afternoon swimming and jogging before dawn, they spent about three hours exploring their new cottage, the Holy Island of Zarathustra. The hot rays of dawn glistened on their skin, and the water dripped off their hair. And, when they returned to Zarathustra at noon, they saw a group of people sitting around a small table with smiles on their faces. Their faces were smiling in a sweet anticipation of a good lovemaking. The only thing missing was an empty-bodied man who enjoyed a good fuck and who enjoyed a good session of love. They would get their hands on a nice warm and warm body just like Zarathustra—their beautiful bodies and their sexy faces and their wet pussies.</p> <p>In a corner of the room, a man and a woman were holding hands. Their hands were wet and glistening, and they exchanged kisses. Then, as though they were looking at the stars and planning their own lives, they walked away from the table. When they reached the beach to their spot outside the door of love, they turned and faced each other with smiles on their faces and a twinkle in their eyes. Their bodies were hot and taut and they were dripping wet under their bikini.</p> <p>At the end of one of their strolls, the happy couple pulled away from the dock in an isolated grove, and the happy couple stood with hands on the beach. Their bodies were afire and throbbed with excitement. Their legs were wet, but they didn't care. Their feet were warm. Their hands were warm. Their feet were wet. They were both horny. Their bodies were ready for each other. They both had big, beautiful breasts, and they looked so sexy and beautiful like their tits and their breasts sagged. Both looked so sexy and vulnerable. They had made love to each other's perfect bodies, and they'd made love on the beach—in their own house. They had come to love each other. As they approached the bed, the lovers stood in silent reverence, their hands on each other's waists, and they were on their own, and on their own bodies, for an endless day.</p> <p>They kissed. Kissed and kissed with passion. They kissed with love. They kissed and kissed with desire. Their bodies were hot. Their hands were warm. Their fingers were wet. Their bodies were hungry—and the lust for each other was a powerful motivator and a powerful aphrodisiac. Their bodies were ready for each other, ready to commit themselves to each other, ready to commit themselves to each other.</p> <p>They kissed. And kissed.</p> <p>Their wet bodies moved slowly and languidly over each other's, and they took turns to suck their lover's nipples, their lover's breasts, Their lover's nipples. Their bodies trembled as they turned into their passionate 69 position. Their hot bodies were pressed together and each was on their knees, back straight, back toward the bed, and down to their knees, and they were on their knees and back straight. Their lips were all moist with passion. Their tongues darted in and out of each other's mouth. The kiss became more and more passionate and their lips became hot with lust, their tongues thrust into each other's mouth. Their kissing became more and more wild. Their passion grew, grew. Their passion grew. Their naked breasts were swollen and full to the point of bursting. The hard nipples were like hard little pebbles against their soft lips. The soft flesh felt wonderful and warm in the heat of their love. Their bodies were flushed and sweaty and slick with perspiration and excitement. Their erect nipples had become the center of the scene.</p> <p>Their kissing became more and more intense. Their moist tongues thrust into each other's mouth with unbridled fervor and together a fire was building in the air. Their kisses were like a firecracker. Their lips were alive with passion and fire. Their bodies were quivering with passion. Their bodies' heat grew stronger, stronger, stronger. They pushed them harder between each other's legs, their bodies, their bodies their legs apart, ach, their lips their bodies them, Their cunts. Their mouths against each other's lips, their bodies' mouths, they held each other's kiss for each other's mouths, their lovers for, for each other's kisses—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
