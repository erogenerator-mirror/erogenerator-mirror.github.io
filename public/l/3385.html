G. Wells </h3><h4>THE FIGHTING BEGINS.</h4><p><strong>Saturday lives in my memory as a day of suspense. It was a day of lassitude too, hot and close, with, I am told, a rapidly fluctuating barometer. I had</strong> a brief moment of panic that the anticipation of it would bring me back from the grave because my mind was in turmoil. I was looking around, desperately trying to be inconspicuous. I had to be.</p> <p>I looked down at the dress, my cock hard and erect, standing proudly at attention. It was just a dress, like normal, and it was pretty conservative in every way, but it was really a pretty modest dress. Of course, it was a dress, not a man's. My dick was so stiff that it poked the hemline on the front of the dress and that's why, when I came out of the bathroom to check on my wife, I was greeted by a sight of a woman, probably the owner of a sex toy store in the parking lot. She was holding that sex toy, and she glanced at it as if reading my mind. She smiled as I neared, and then looked up and her eyes flew to mine.</p> <p>I almost came there at the sight. I'd never been into another man's wife, but in my wildest imaginings the scene of two women with a sex toy in their hands, with their tongue sticking out of the woman's mouth, with her looking down at them in disgust, in a look of complete surrender, made my cock even harder. Her head was bent lower, her eyes boring into me, and it appeared that she had the intention of sucking or fucking the toy, and if she had I might have climaxed there and then. The thought of her coming face to face with the toy was almost too powerful for me, like a narcotic.</p> <p>She had the opportunity for almost any woman but me, and her face was an unreadable mask of total submission. It didn't matter. I'd been in the presence of that woman for a few seconds, and I could smell a subtle, sexy perfume. She was probably going to fuck herself in the sex toy store as well. I found the idea of her doing that to me both oddly arousing. In a moment I thought, what's the harm in it? I'd taken her into my fantasy, and now I could have her right where I wanted her.</p> <p>The woman with the sex toy opened her mouth for a "no comment" look, and I realized I was in the presence of the woman with the toy. She closed the door and turned back to my wife. "You okay with this?" she asked.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," my wife said, and she smiled then, as though she wanted to make the joke and be certain that she was doing what she was doing. She looked down at a dildo, and her face was almost completely hidden, but there was just a hint of a smile. She turned the little toy towards my wife, and I saw the little plastic toy, almost as though it were the same toy as the woman.</p> <p>I watched as my wife sucked this man's cock, and then I saw her face. She was biting her lip as my wife worked her mouth on me, and then her eyes came up briefly. They didn't change, they stayed with me. I watched as her pussy got wetter and wetter, until, in the instant, she was completely lost in the act, sucking my cock for dear life, and her tongue pushed into the shaft, the tongue that had been teasing it in the bathroom. She never broke stride, never tried to stop, and she always just licked my cock.</p> <p>She never stopped as long as I didn't react. I wanted her to have it. In the moment I felt the tension go out of my balls and the first spurts of the hot salty cum I was sure I'd never shoot into my wife's mouth, I was ready to pass. I was close, but I was trying to make the most of the feeling, to not ejaculate to yet anyway. Just the thought of it, it wouldn't be long before I'd explode. Right now I thought I'd lost power. I was close.</p> <p>There was a pause while the woman pulled the man's cock out of her mouth. She looked down at my wife before looking back up at me with that same smile. "Don't worry, sweetie," the man said, "there's plenty of time. His big fucking load is about to go right up his leg. You've got five minutes. Time to go inside."</p> <p>I couldn't believe the thought that had just occurred to me. I was pretty sure it had been me coming over there, but I was so glad that my dick was hard. I would have come. I was ready for it.</p> <p>My wife's head was bobbing up and down on the man's cock. I thought I could hear the man saying to her; "Yes. Yes. Yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes." It is it's so fucking fantastic. It is. You're too good.
