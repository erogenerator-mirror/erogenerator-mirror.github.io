Not the type to be alone for long, to feel attracted to just one or more persons; in fact it may even have been so when he thought she was about to do those things with him. So now he decided to do so and take his chances, which for the present, was the easiest and also the safest way. It took a little courage and a little time, but once he got into it he had no trouble to persuade her to let him in.</p> <p>For all his years of relationship he had seen many women who could seduce him. For them they made or dressed up for sex and he had no interest in that and, well not in fucking them but just getting blow jobs. He had no problem having a threesome with them and he had seen so many women who looked like that (as if they hadn't already done it). He had seen other men being used which led to many orgasms, he had seen many women showing their fannies to him, but mainly they were looking sexy and desirable which suited him to a T and an A, and he had no problems getting into the mood.</p> <p>They took his hand and led him to a room. It was a bedroom with a bed, some light coloured curtains, and a big mirror against the wall. They both undressed him and he let himself be shown the way to the bed by the two women.</p> <p>And in a way they were seducing him too. He was mesmerized looking at them undressing him. It was as if he was mesmerized, and the way this happened seemed to be going from one to the other. To him they were not just seducing him at all, they were fucking him. That he could see clearly without looking up, but it was him anyway. Her bra was a pink lace set with small pink flowers on it and he couldn't see the shape of her breasts. At that point, the realisation hit him so hard that he had to put his foot down.</p> <p>Her panties were pink with an embroidered floral design. Her breasts seemed to be a little smaller than his wife´s so she was small in height and when he looked at her he saw that he was right. But what she had on was very sexy. He knew she was very voluptuous, but he had never guessed she had such a sexy body. Her bush was very dark and it made her pussy lips stand out alluringly.</p> <p>They kissed for a minute or two and then he had to take them off. She was now on her back and he had both hands free to touch and touch as he wished. That is, if they were going to fuck him. He was in a way giving them his body, so as to show him how much he loved them. There was one thing that he wanted to take off and on seeing her he knew he had no problem for them to have undressed or let him undress. He was too shy, not really having the same interest in sex that his wife liked because she felt he needed to be controlled and treated as the dominant thing in their relationship. Of course, he also wanted to have sex with her too, but it would be just the two of them, not a part of their lovemaking. The thing was that they could use his body any way they wished to.</p> <p>She put her mouth to his and started sucking him. Not just sucking him, but also laving his entire length with her tongue. It seemed to please him so much to just lay there feeling her tongue and mouth on his cock which was already hardening nicely. He loved it, it felt so nice and natural and in fact so much fun to be caressing her boobs while doing her there, especially one of his wife´s boobs. After a while she started licking her way up his cock to the tip and back down again. And still licking and licking him. Her pussy was moist, wet and just like his, which is what drove him crazy. She loved his cock, she would suck him just his cock then she moved up to take him in her mouth again.</p> <p>She was also making loud slurping sounds which drove him wild. Suddenly she moved towards him and he could not believe what he saw! She had never done that before, and he had never imagined anything like this, but seeing her now had the power, and all the power of a woman. She sucked him very firmly and her tongue was inside his balls, licking and stroking them as she came up. She took him all the way in her tight mouth and started fucking him with her mouth with all the force of a long, fast strokes. He couldn't hold it! He wanted to fuck her mouth right now. Suddenly suddenly he started to push deeper. He tried to fuck her but she was so much better yet she got up or he tried to—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
