They loved each other dearly, but sorrowed much that they</strong> had to find a suitable match for such a beautiful woman.</p> <p>They made love all over again, but then they decided to be patient and move slowly, because this time, it was about more than love and romance. This time, it was about love and romance, but their love-making might just be a first time mistake.</p> <p>It started with kisses, then became gradually deeper and more passionate. She enjoyed the touch of his naked chest, while he enjoyed her beautiful face and her long hair framing her, they lay on their side, kissing and feeling each other. Her hand moved slowly to caress his body, feeling the weight and hardness of his cock. He felt her touch, so different on the inside, but just as sexy. It gave him an idea!</p> <p>'That's not fair,' he moaned, 'you're supposed to be doing something!'</p> <p>His lips broke off their kiss, and she looked at him questioningly,</p> <p>'No, I just want to kiss you,' he replied, pulling away again to kiss her lips.</p> <p>She smiled shyly, 'you don't mind, you know, kissing your wife would be fun.'</p> <p>'Maybe not at first,' he said, 'but I'd like to see how much you want,' and he kissed her lips again. Then he started sucking on them again, feeling her moan, and her hand moved slowly down his body, caressing his belly before reaching his cock.</p> <p>She smiled as she felt his hard cock as the tip of her hand passed over it, stroking it in a slow hand. His breathing quickened, and he started massaging her breasts a bit harder, making them look sexy and perky.</p> <p>'O-okay,' she breathed, taking a sip from her glass of wine, 'let me kiss you again. I want you to feel good.'</p> <p>They kissed again, each of them feeling different, as their desire grew a bit, each of their hearts raced slightly. Then she sat astride him, and they kissed, slowly pushing their tongues out against each of their.</p> <p>Her mouth tasted his, and every taste of him tasted so good, as his mouth, tasted hers and his fingers caressed her body. She was still a little drunk, so she held his eyes while he caressed her body. So he moved his hands around her body, moving his fingers between her legs to feel the folds of her wet pussy.</p> <p>She was still smiling, so she held him to her mouth, while his hand slipped inside of hers to feel her pussy, as if exploring the moist warmth of her body. This time was no different since she was still smiling after it with a sip of her wine.</p> <p>His erection pressed against her hand, and she giggled, 'You're making me horny!'</p> <p>'Don't let us stop, this time, I want to see how much I can fuck your lovely bride' he said while caressing her face.</p> <p>She nodded with a smile, and they kissed again, this time with more passion than before.</p> <p>She was now lying atop him, her body on top of his, kissing him again. She pushed his hands down to the small of her back, before lying down to pull him closer so that he wasn't touching her breasts, and she started kissing him again, their hands moving from her breasts to each other's pussy. As they felt each other more and more, their arousal grew.</p> <p>She slowly pushed his fingers into it, while he slid his fingers deeper into her pussy, making her moan.</p> <p>At the same time, her face became flush with lust and she was getting close to cumming! She moaned with pleasure as the warm, wet tongue explored her pussy, caressing its hot folds.</p> <p>He caress-ed her legs, pulling her closer to he waist while kissing her neck so passionately. As her body got closer by moving over his, his cock pressed against her pussy, wanting to have her close to cumming, instead.</p> <p>The pleasure was too much for them both to handle and they moaned together as his cock pushed its way into her pussy.</p> <p>She pulled a bit harder on his shoulders now, as she pushed herself back.</p> <p>He kissed her lips to keep time to her moaning, and kissed her chin. She moaned louder, pushing herself back, feeling her nipples pushing against his chest. As her hips pushed forward to meet his cock, he pulled her body tight against him, still - not leaving her legs as she started rolling her body on his, a way.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>and took the bed she wanted it felt his cock, it in her, and, slowly, she moaned, making her to the love, the pleasures of love of her body, as he wanted</p> <p></p> <p>then in</p> <p></p> <p>made her bodyâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
