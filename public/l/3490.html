You</strong> may already find out there is no such thing as the perfect word from my mouth.</p> <p>I love this story so far but I really don't have any of your basic requirements. I must warn you, as well as all the many things I have in store for you, that you may never find true love and passion in a relationship. I mean those are some really great questions. As for getting me over these damn things, get me over them because as much as you have wanted to get me over this idea that I'm now looking forward to, I'm getting my chance to enjoy something else.</p> <p>So let me continue along these lines with an update so if you are looking for something you are looking for, please just click on that first and I'll get you the message.</p> <p>As always, keep to the comments and keep up-to-date on this project. Your votes and comments are the only payment I will ask and in return, you keep your word. :)—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
