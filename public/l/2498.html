So I decided to try to use some of it. It seems that the first thing to find when making my first "fuck" was to use a condom. I'd not had a partner in so long, I decided to take one and put a condom on. Not because the idea scared me but because the idea of fucking a stranger was not appealing. Even though I knew that a condom was not what would be safe...</p> <p>To finish, I started out carefully, rubbing the head of my cock up and down her slit a few seconds. It had to be her first time, and I needed to be careful. It was not too long, I thought, and as I pressed forward with my cock, I could feel her juices coating my cock. I continued to go slowly into her until I felt her warmth and wetness against my cock. I started to pull back and I didn't realize that her first time was also going to be by way of a fuck.</p> <p>I was still in the middle of fucking someone I barely knew. Maybe it is because I had a condom! Well, I guess it could have something to do with that; it's not something that one does in a car, for instance, but you do not need a condom in a car either. I started pumping into her, slowly. I was surprised at how wet she was going to be when I hit the bottom. I felt her thighs clamp around my waist and my legs were pressed up against her back. She let a low moan escape her lips.</p> <p>We continued to work our way back and forth, I had to move in and out of her slowly and she could have let go of my body; her legs could. But she didn't let go. She held onto me and I enjoyed every inch of it. The idea of letting her cum was exciting; I still couldn't believe that I had been doing that for someone who was nearly fifty years younger than me. Of course she was still so tight, but the knowledge that I had never had a woman so much tighter than me was still foreign.</p> <p>She was moving with me as much as I was thrusting, and it was hard to keep hold of her. I could feel her pussy spasming on my cock with every push. Her tits were bouncing with the movement of our bodies and we could both see some of the skin on my thighs getting shiny with her juices. The idea of making her cum was even more exciting than if she was sucking on me.</p> <p>Suddenly, I felt her pussy start to tighten around my cock and I felt her walls start to tighten. There was a sharp slap and I felt her inner muscles clamp just before an explosion, which felt like a lightning strike. I also felt myself go over the edge, and I groaned in ecstasy. It was then I realized how incredibly turned on I was.</p> <p>"I'm cumming," I said.</p> <p>"I can feel it, you're not supposed to cum inside of me."</p> <p>I could hear the disappointment in her voice. Well, I had to, there was no other option but to cum in her. So I decided to really go for it. I pulled out of her and we both started taking off our clothes. Once we were both naked, she started to caress me. I took her hand and took it to my cock and started to stroke it, making her do the same for me. It felt amazing to be stroking a woman who hadn't cum during the last day and half. The feeling of my cock inside of her was a first.</p> <p>I knew then that I really wanted to continue. I pulled away from her, slid her on top of me, and started kissing her again. She went with me as I put her into a missionary position with her arms over my face and breasts pushing against my chest. We started going at each other. I wanted to kiss her, bite her, but there were some things that I didn't want to do to each other. To make a long sentence, we ended up lying on the bed in bed, naked at first, then she mounted me and started putting it into her.</p> <p>"This is the new thing for me," she said. "I want you to do this."</p> <p>I felt her vagina stretch for the first time around my manhood. She closed her eyes as she began to move me in and out in long strokes. It felt good to have her so excited and so close to cumming with me inside her. She was getting very excited and was going to cum when I felt her tighten around me again and I felt her lips wrapping onto my lips. I thought we were in the ultimate connection. Her body was mine and that she came when she had no longer, it could have been. But it felt like this she had been no longer and. She kept stillâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
