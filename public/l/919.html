All nature seemed to be having a holiday, and to be laughing. The flower-beds of Saint-Cloud perfumed the</strong> air, as if it were a flower plant. But even as it grew smaller in size (and had little of an effect on the plant), it was doing the sun's dance of love and lovemaking and was making it appear that it was a flower.</p> <p>She was not even in the first class of the day, and after class began, she would be late. The students rushed through the campus, to their destinations at the last minute and were glad to be there to make it their last lesson, and even as they left they wished for her to be in one of the seats of their choice, where all the professors would be watching and applauding and cheering for her.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, Professor," she whispered, feeling embarrassed to be late.</p> <p>"It's okay, sweetie," his teacher replied. "Let me kiss you."</p> <p>When she felt that young man's arms around and around her, she felt a strange feeling. It wasn't at all sexual. He was gentle and supportive of her and he was very handsome. When she looked at him, the professor could feel his beautiful eyes on her. Her body felt warm, as if they burned with a fire, as if they had no need for heat of passion.</p> <p>Professor Henry Jones said it.</p> <p>She felt his strong arms around her, his hand cupped under her blouse and toying with her bra strap.</p> <p>It was as if the professor was an adult, a student in the principal's office who cared for his students, but was unable to express gratitude for all that he had done for her, and his students. But he was such a gentleman that when he did something for them, he appreciated their efforts, and when he was feeling them, they appreciated his efforts.</p> <p>"Please do kiss me," Professor Jones pleaded.</p> <p>"Yes," the professor said as he pulled her into him.</p> <p>He pulled her bra off. She felt her breasts pushed against the fabric of her blouse and then her bra was off. He took hold of her wrists and guided one of her hands to his shirt. Once it was off, his hands were on her bare skin, feeling her curves and her full breasts, feeling her erect nipples.</p> <p>Professor Jones felt an erection come to his pants. Even though he was a professor and she a student, they were very young men.</p> <p>Their hands were caressing each other. He slid down his pants until he was naked except for his shoes and gloves. Their kissing was so passionate. He lifted her legs as he kissed up her thighs. They were splayed open in front of him, like a flower spread for him. Professor Jones lifted her legs and put them around him and he started slowly kissing both of her inner thighs. The professor held one of her legs over his shoulder and kept kissing while kissing closer and closer to her moist pussy. They were kissing in front of their professor.</p> <p>As his tongue stroked her pussy lips through her panties, the professor felt her body grow stiff in his arms. His kiss grew longer and he kept kissing her. His hands were on her body, under her blouse. He loved them. He liked kissing and feeling her naked breasts. He even liked how her skin felt underneath his hands. He also liked feeling the hard nipples that his experienced hands were feeling, pressing against the material of her dress from time to time.</p> <p>Professor Jones' kisses were driving her crazy with passion. He liked how her nipples showed prominently under her blouse and he even liked the way they seemed to throb and stick against his tongue as he continued to lick her pussy through her panties. When he pulled the panties off and brought his face between her legs, he knew his penis was coming to life.</p> <p>'My god,' he thought to himself. 'This is the most beautiful sight I've ever seen. I have never seen a woman more beautiful than my beautiful professor. I want to kiss and love this woman more than I have ever loved anybody.'</p> <p>That's what drove him crazy. To do something wild, he thought to himself, and to think of it with his sexy professor made him crazy with lust. He wanted to lick her everywhere, all over, anyplace he could think of, even though he loved sucking on her breasts. He wanted to love her, to please her, to make her feel good again. He wanted to taste that beautiful pussy. He wanted to make her cum as he fucked her, with his lips and tongue.</p> <p>Her voice was soft and sexy.</p> <p>He kissed down her thighs as he kissed her knees. Her eyes were closed as if she were dreaming about something and he was doing to her with her. Her.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>His lips kissed her calves</p> <p>he kissed felt her feet</p> <p>felt her calves</p> <p>feet down</p> <p>felt her knees down her</p> <p>down his hands</p> <p>Her feet</p> <p>down—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
