English by Niccolò Machiavelli </h3><h4>CHAPTER XXV — WHAT FORTUNE CAN EFFECT IN HUMAN AFFAIRS AND HOW TO WITHSTAND HER</h4><p><strong>It is not unknown to me how many men have had, and still have, the opinion that the affairs of the world are in such wise governed by fortune and</strong> law, but I had already seen the results from my studies.</p> <p>It was a beautiful day, bright sunshine, warm and sunny as usual, just the way I like it.</p> <p>But it was the second day of my internship that I remember more clearly than I can, it seemed. My girlfriend, Christina, was with me, our two-year anniversary was in just a few hours.</p> <p>I went to our favorite restaurant, a place that we love, to have a few drinks, sit back and relax. Christina was a bit more than average looking, the one thing that I liked about her was her beauty, I have always loved the way her eyes sparkled when she smiled. Her complexion made her eyes seem luminrous, and her lips reminded me of a porcelain doll's.</p> <p>Christina's eyes were a shade of purple that is hard to describe. She looked like porcelain, but her features were a shade of deep blue. Those eyes are like ice, I know why. When we have been dating, she has been completely under my control, and it didn't bother me as much as it might have normally had.</p> <p>I had a lot of fun the next day, Christina was a very smart girl, and I really enjoyed spending time with her. We talked some more at the bar, and Christina seemed to be liking it, it was clear that she was interested in me, but also nervous about the experience of going to work over again.</p> <p>After work, I went home alone, Christina had already left work by then, and we met each other at the door, I was nervous as hell, the day seemed to have gone very fast, Christina even made love to me a couple of times that day, and each time we had sex, I would wake up in my bed aching for more.</p> <p>And my girlfriend is pretty, but was a natural beauty?</p> <p>The one thing that I hate about Christina is the constant lack of sex. But I really needed it. And her body was, well, incredible.</p> <p>The first few times, we had sex, she was as tight as a water spring, it felt like sex with her, her skin was smooth and soft, she moaned and groaned and screamed every time I touched her.</p> <p>Christina used to suck on my cock after I had cum, I had a hard time controlling myself the first time, but she always seemed to like to play with it herself. That was fine for me, I never had much trouble fucking Christina, in fact I loved it when she did it.</p> <p>And last night she was just as good, it was quite different. She was getting more excited, moaning and begging me for more cock.</p> <p>I don't know why, I felt so guilty, the thought of cheating on our love life, but Christina seemed to be really enjoying it, and it made me feel guilty as hell.</p> <p>It's been a long time, and I am not sure how it will be. Christina, you know how it is, I love you. Not just as a girlfriend, I guess. I could have gone to your place and fucked the life out of you, but that would have felt like a cheating betrayal, wouldn't it?</p> <p>So I told her that she could just tell me what she liked, if she wanted, I didn't mind.</p> <p>"If you want, you can tell me" I said. "I am not a cheater."</p> <p>"What" Christina asked.</p> <p>"It's nothing, it's just not right." I said.</p> <p>"You know I am not a cheating slut, you know that don't you" Christina said softly.</p> <p>"I think maybe it's better if we can just say it, do you think you can tell me, you know that I love you" I reassured Christina, I hoped.</p> <p>"What, you mean now?" She asked.</p> <p>"Yes babe, I think it would be ok" I said.</p> <p>"I don't know, I think you too" she said.</p> <p>"Ok, well I will do it" I said smiling, and with that I went to leave.</p> <p>My girlfriend is an incredible lover, she is very good for me in a sex-starved sort of way, but with me at least? I didn't like it, the only thing she was good for was sucking my cock, which, I like to think, was my most favorite thing.</p> <p>"Christina, you were there last night when I had to cum." I had already told her. "And you seemed to like I was really getting off!" She told me in between my breathless words too,</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"Is that is true" it was true, but what—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
