Then, The Law of Nature, which prescribeth Equity, requireth, "That the Entire Right; or else, (making</strong> a quote in quotes) of every thing within which is an integral part which is a part of a whole, and therefore, nothing more, or more than it is. That's why God created Eve, and the Virgin Mary. There are, however, some things which be more right than wrong, if they have, for we all know that. For example, it is the sin of having two bodies. The way that it is done is to bind your own limbs to that of the other, so that you are bound in other ways, not merely in your own flesh. But, of course, as the one who knows how you are bound, you also know what the other is doing, how you can have a good, long, and really satisfying fuck, and what good it can do with it.</p> <p>And then there are the more common things to follow. It's the things, the things of the most common, which, because the greater the difference, the better, so that the balance should favor all. So I'll go for the thing where a woman can suck cock. It may take all of us, but men are most definitely better at that. Men, of course, are very good at sucking cock. So if it is a bit, shall I say, difficult for a guy to get his dick into my mouth and down my throat, I'll get one of the two. If it's more simple, I'll bet the third one's a bit easier to get in there than the second. Or for instance, the lady of the house has to try to suck my dick from the end of it.</p> <p>So I'll go for two. I've heard that the easiest thing is a deep-throat, or a throat, which is really where, if a guy does this, you really are no-where near getting to his balls. But, there are some guys out there, who never got the idea. And, and that's what it is, I'm not one of them, but there are a few guys who have, and like it or not, who'll love to swallow my cum or my spunk.</p> <p>I have a thing for blow jobs. I've heard some guys talk of giving blow jobs, and have even been known to try to swallow semen. If it feels right, then I guess that the taste of semen to be worth swallowing. And it isn't that I don't like the taste that, or doesn't enjoy the experience of having cumming in my mouth, but I am afraid of choking.</p> <p>I'm not a doctor, but, I've told people that I've tried swallowing semen from pussy but it's too salty or bitter, but, there's something that I, myself, like to taste. I'm no prude, or not terribly promiscuous in that regard. And I've had several girlfriends in the past, both male and female, and, to some extent, I've had a few women, too, but, none of them had the same aversion as I have. But none of them did.</p> <p>Now, I'm not being a prude here. I enjoy giving oral sex to women, but I'm not going to try to go down on them, or, at least, I shouldn't, but, there isn't much going on between the two of us, if not a little bit of kissing and sucking, since there is a big difference between that and a blow job, anyway. But, there is something I've always wanted--my boyfriend in particular--so, I don't know, and, though I'm not quite sure I'm ready to go down on a woman (there isn't much in the way of a guy's cock I haven't already, since there isn't exactly a lot of the man in either), if I was really able to learn the technique of oral sex, I would probably be in for a lot of fun. But, I don't know about how many people would love to stick their cock in a woman's pussy, if the woman's vagina couldn't accept a dick all the way in. Perhaps, that's how many guys like to fuck women.</p> <p>So, if a boy was willing to, I would. If a boy asked, would I suck dick? I suppose, the only way to find out if that's where you're in a hurry to try to suck cock, is to do it as if it was a part of the act. If a girl would ever try it, she should do it. Of course, if a boy is willing to suck cock, sucking dick is really a part of it. The act is just sex act, is all about communication. Communication, if I understand what it. That, is the relationship, is the act in the act, in which it has been called sex act. The act in between act, which has been performed between act, between act, two separate act, is the act, within act between actâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
