How God speaketh to a</strong> man is not an uncommon desire, I suppose.</p> <p>I have always loved fucking. Having my dick sucked. That's the only word I can think of to use for describing the joys of fucking. In fact, that's what I was referring to while I was sucking my grandfather's dick. Oh yes, I've sucked my grandfather's cock before. Yes, he has an uncircumcised dick. And he is still a virgin. And he hasn't been with a man for over twenty years. And how could I not love fucking, in order to prevent my grandfather from being his first, when I've already fucked many, many thousands of other men?</p> <p>I had fucked my grandfather's cock in front of him. I had fucked my grandfather's cock in front of everyone. He was fucking a beautiful girl. And we both had watched his cock as he fucked her. And I'd liked it as I watched him fuck her. But I didn't think I could stop fucking her even though he was fucking her behind.</p> <p>I'd liked my father fucking me. So I'd enjoyed fucking him as well. But we'd never been together. Then I began to wonder if God would accept me again. When he was my grandfather, how could he possibly accept me again? What would a good father and son do, when he was my father? What would it be like to have incest with his son? Would he accept that incest was wrong? Would he understand? Would he hate me? Would I feel shame in committing incest in front of my family?</p> <p>Oh God, what to do. Why couldn't it be me who was being fucked by my grandmother? What happened when my mother went to heaven? I needed to have sex. I needed for my grandfather to make love to me, in front of all his family and friends. I hadn't known if I wanted to fuck and who I wanted to fuck at the same time, if he made love to me before he had made love to me. I didn't know if I wanted to be fucked and who I wanted to be fucked by.</p> <p>So as I continued to feel my dick in and out of Mom's pussy, as I thrust myself deep into my grandmother's pussy, I wished that god wanted me all the time. If God wanted me to make love to my grandfather, as well as my grandmother and as he did with me, I wished that God wanted me to make love to my grandfather.</p> <p>Chapter 3. Is it wrong? Should I fuck my Grandmother? Should I make love to her and what is this world going to become? If God will forgive me the gift of God, I'd made love with my grandmother. Why in the world would I ever want to make love to my grandmother? I'd never made love to my grandmother. I'd made love with my mother. That's what I'd always wanted to do. Now I was fucking my mother. That's enough for me to know I had made love to my mother. And I had made love to my mother in front of my Grandfather. And I'd never made love to my mother before.</p> <p>But I didn't think God would forgive me.</p> <p>Chapter 4. Was it wrong?</p> <p>I hadn't made love with my mother. Well, I had. For I had never had love. I had never loved. I didn't enjoy sex. I didn't enjoy kissing and touching. I'd never enjoyed love. I never loved.</p> <p>The more often I thought of all the ways of not making love to my mother in the way that I had always loved her, the more I wondered what God said to me when he said that to me.</p> <p>The more often I thought of her and God when he said my mother and I should have a child, the more I wondered what God is going to do when God gives me up.</p> <p>I'd never made love.</p> <p>I wondered if God would give me up for my mother. Would he give my mother up for me for making love to her? If God gave me up for making love to my mother in the way that I always thought of the greatest loving man I'd ever known in my mind, if God gave my mother to me, would he give her to me? Would he give me my mother to fuck?</p> <p>Chapter 5. My Grandmother, God.</p> <p>I was beginning to wonder if I was destined to find a man in God's name. If God gave my mother up for fucking. If God gave me my mother, then yes, I'm destined to fuck my mother. But for the love of God and my grandmother, I'm now a woman. I'm a womanâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
