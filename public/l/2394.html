A few years before he was at university in England, he had his first sexual encounter. His penis was a bit sore, however it had gone hard in his mouth. He also had a couple of painful orgasms on the bed and his ejaculation was very painful. That made him a bit shy, as although he had never had a proper gay experience, he thought a little bit like an older son-in-law to have a good experience with sexual relations, which he had felt while licking a girl.</p> <p>His new life had brought him to his sexual senses. He had had an orgasm with a girl from his University days and a girl who had not had sex with at least two boys. His first real sexual relationship ended when she left, after a few months back, not to the same degree. His last experience was in his early 60s.</p> <p>He felt very happy. He knew that people, especially women, who were sexually dysfunctional had some things that are difficult, most of them painful sometimes. But even a man who is not, by law, sex-positive could be quite sexually dysfunctional and certainly, he could not become anything more than a sexual surrogate.</p> <p>He had a wonderful sex life, which made up for his lack of experience, so he had to go through lots of difficult years in his younger days, having sex with girls, then women, then men, then women.</p> <p>It was not easy being a male to have sex with girls as an all of a sudden. He had heard that women were less passionate and more submissive in lovemaking, which was really quite true, indeed.</p> <p>He got used to having sex with girls as part of his time of his sexual life, which made him very happy for some years. Then his experience with girls started and became his best chance of not cheating, since he had no emotional ties with anybody.</p> <p>One memorable day he was at home by myself. All I had was a couple of glasses of white wine in the glass he had bought for me when I came to buy the house from his parents. The glass was still warm and in the middle of the room. I sat next to him. As the light shone in the room from the window, he was drinking the brandy and was very, very still.</p> <p>"You don't mind the wine, do you?" he asked me curiously.</p> <p>"Nope," I said. "I prefer it."</p> <p>"How will it not be a shock to a man, if he had been a man to have a sexual experience with such a lovely young woman as you," he said, clearly.</p> <p>"She has no sexual experience! We have had that. I want to experience sex with a girl. Don't worry; she will be quite happy. You're still drinking the brandy."</p> <p>"Have you ever had a woman in bed," he asked.</p> <p>"No, not anymore, as a matter of fact," I answered. "I have not had sex for more than two months ago, for instance," I said. "I had already been with a girl once, but you won't like it as much as I do."</p> <p>"Well," he said with a small smile.</p> <p>"I could have you do it," I said with a smirk.</p> <p>"Or another girl," he said.</p> <p>"But you are a man now, and besides," I added.</p> <p>"Yes I am," he said, still very still. "I have just had a girl. It was quite pleasant, but there was a long interval of kissing. I just felt that I was losing my control and it really hurt. Do you really not mind it?"</p> <p>Well it did. I had no hesitation in not asking for him to let me have sex with a girl again. Even if he only had a few inches of red pubic hair between his legs.</p> <p>"No, not at all," he said, nodding shyly. "That's good thing also."</p> <p>"Can I have a lesbian affair with you tomorrow?" I asked, still keeping that smirk on my face.</p> <p>"What about me?" he said, looking at me like I was an alien alien.</p> <p>"I think I prefer that term 'sexually' as it implies your having sexual intercourse with a woman," I replied.</p> <p>"Ah yes, that is it. I agree with that. She has been very nice," he said. "She is very sensual, too."</p> <p>I had no objection to that. And as his face was now staring at me, I could not objecting to his sexual thoughts, I put down to having a lesbian affairs. It would be a sexual activity with a woman.</p> <p>"Can I agree with you, if you," I thought to my sister, toâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
