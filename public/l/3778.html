"Yeah... just make room... a little deeper... a bit harder." I said, as I pushed as deep as I could take her into me and I pushed her up further. Her cunt was so unbelievably tight and wet, which caused her to scream again. "Fuck! Yes!" she howled, as my cock pressed even harder. "Fuck me!!!"</p> <p>"Do it again." I replied.</p> <p>She didn't need asking twice, she obeyed. "Aaaaahhh... god... fuck me!!!"</p> <p>I wasn't as patient as she was. She felt different, I could tell. Something inside of her was getting stronger. I could feel it, her pussy pulsing. "Ohhh!!!" she howled again as she orgasmed. I pushed myself in and out her with the same rhythm as we fucked. My own cock throbbed inside of her. The feeling of our bodies slamming together was very erotic, and for a brief minute I thought of making love to her again, instead. But that thought was soon drowned out.</p> <p>The feeling of her cunt clenching around my cock was too much and my orgasm started to build in my groin. She was breathing so hard we could hardly breathe. "Wait a sec." was all I said.</p> <p>"How long?" she asked. Her voice was so soft I barely heard her. She was barely able to breathe and her body was shaking uncontrollably. I pulled out of her and stood up. She looked in my eyes as I did so, but didn't say anything. I walked slowly behind her towards my room. Her ass was still shaking, but the feeling of her ass walls was almost gone. The sex we just enjoyed was too much to keep. The feeling of the wall next to her ass was suddenly gone.</p> <p>She got up on one arm again and lay down. As I stood behind her I reached around and pulled her breasts together. Her nipples were sensitive, and I could feel that she was leaking a lot of moisture and from her own pussy too. I took one of her boobs into my mouth and sucked on it.</p> <p>"That feels... too much!" she said, but I felt a change in my position. She was now looking down, from below, taking in our coupling. "Ahhh....." she said, "I love you!"</p> <p>"I love you too!" I said, as I turned her around and hugged her tightly. She kissed me lightly on the lips. "I'm really glad you came here this weekend." She took one of the glasses of wine and gulped down half of it. "And I'm glad you came." With that, she sat on the sofa and we went back to making out.</p> <p>It was a little different from the way that I had with my sister all those years ago. I made her drink that wine, and I made her feel very horny, too. She began to rub the back of her hand on her pussy, trying to rub a finger in there too. "I'm ready for you." she said, as she put the glass on the coffee table. She got up onto the coffee table and bent down, lifting one leg up and resting the other on the back of the sofa. We made out a while more, now feeling like teenagers at their first date, just on the verge of lovemaking.</p> <p>I positioned myself between her legs and put my cock in the pussy I had so many times before. She wrapped her legs around my body, kissing me as I tried to move inside her. She pushed her legs back as I pressed down and she got excited enough even from just her hands groped around my body. Our thrusts together created more movement, but still no orgasm. My mouth went around hers, trying to keep any sound out of her, and mine went in a circular motion in her mouth. Her legs tightened tight around my body and she went rigid herself.</p> <p>Then I did what I did the first time I had made love with her in Paris. I put my body on top of hers, holding my weight on one arm as we embraced. We kissed like lovers, our lips smacking against each other. Our tongues fought each other and I squeezed her breast hard and she could feel my hard cock pressed up to her pussy. We were making noise, both of us breathing hard, and one noise was enough to send that picture through my mind of her being caught in the act of sex by her teacher who had walked in on us masturbating with the knowledge that we couldn't be heard from the teachers in their classroom. I did the same thing. With that picture I had of her getting caught on the balcony from her being caught by the one student who had lookedâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
