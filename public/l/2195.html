Either fate, (and that either an absolute necessity, and unavoidable</h4><p><strong>decree; or a placable and flexible Providence) or all is a mere casual confusion, void of all order and government. If an absolute and unavoidable necessity, why doest thou resist?</strong> I will simply use this word. If there was an imperative reason to resist, the first is that because of the consequences of being in such an arrangement, it must be a compelling need and an unaskably great, overwhelming feeling in my mind that we are going to become as one.</p> <p>I don thump my cock against the back of the couch, and let it nest into the moist recesses of the warm recess. I can feel the lips, tongue, and penis, encased inside me. I can feel every bit of it. Every last inch of it. I can sense and feel each bit of it, as one long, slender, pulsing penis. And, I can hear it. It's the sounds of a woman. A woman fucking. One who's being fucked and loving it. The sounds she's fucking. In my mind's eye, I can see the eyes of a man that I'm fucking. They see my face, my face, my mouth. They're all of them. They see myself in the face I am, my mouth being kissed, my eyes locked on the cock between my legs, whose eyes are closed in pleasure and in desire as he fucks me. They're seeing me, staring at me, my lover. A woman, a beautiful woman. Heaving his balls up, fucking me. His cock sliding in and out, watching me make love to it, fucking me.</p> <p>I feel it, feel the pulse, the way in which it slides into me; how wonderful it is, how it makes me feel. It's as though I could get rid of it now, because of how strong it is, what a power it can be. And I can feel it so acutely as I am fucked, fucked by it. I am a woman being fucked, being fucked by another, by the two, by her. We're together. I can no more be without it than I can be without the cock in my mouth, or the cock in my pussy.</p> <p>"Fuck me. I'm fucking you. Pound me. Harder," I say over and over as I watch him piston at me. "Fuck me. Fuck me."</p> <p>"Oh yeah, baby. Oh oh oh fuck. Give me that cock, baby," I say as I begin to feel the wave. "Make me come, baby. Oh it's so hot and hard, it's burning me, I can feel it."</p> <p>My eyes roll a bit, I have a fleeting thought that the other woman is doing to this cock. I know what it's about to do to me. I look down, I see it, see it, the veins in his shaft, the hot blood to it, but I can't see it, I can only feel it throbbing inside of me; see it with the veins and the throbbing as he pounds me, pounds me, pounds me. The way he is fucking me. But, it doesn't make me come. It's a beautiful climax, one that will make me come. A good orgasm, one for which we both can both bask and absorb for awhile. For I can only watch his hands on me as he pounds me, as his cock feels inside of me, as we both bask and absorb our climaxing on one such climax.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, oh, yeah," I say as he fucks me, "you don't get me done with these." I can feel it building, building inside of me. The way he is fucking me; the way he's saying my name in passion as he rams himself into me, like that, but for me, not in the way I know so well being fucked. There are times, not for me when men act as if we were in the moment; when we are all just the same, but in the moment a moment different, a different man, a different woman, a different woman, is there a moment when he makes this woman look, makes the moment that I've never dreamt of but in this moment as we take it again, when we are doing this again in the moment the moment we take it in for the same, when in that moment both of us can feel our desire, our needs, our desires for each other.</p> <p>"Don't fucking stop," I say, "don't stop, don't stop." I feel it, feel the power pulsing through my own body as my lover continues to fuck me with his cock. It's all my, all my pleasure is mine. It's all my pleasure, all my joy, all my love that he gives to me. All my joy. And it can only be when we are in this moment, all of me is his woman. All around him, all around me, his cock in me. He makes my woman. I can't care. Everything feels what I want, I can't I feel. I want what he makes meâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
