Major Cavalcanti</h4><p><strong>Both the count and Baptistin had told the truth when they announced to Morcerf the proposed visit of the major, which had served Monte Cristo as a pretext for declining</strong> Morcerf.</p> <p>As my time was nearing its end, I thought of what might happen at the end of the month.</p> <p>The summer of 1975.</p> <p>The summer after my junior year, I went on vacation to Puerto Rico.</p> <p>My friends there were all different species. One had darker skin than the other. The first time I came here was on our 18th birthday. The second time I made out with my girlfriends, on several occasions I lost count. The last time the other girls came to my room to make out and make out was the night of my birthday party.</p> <p>I had not known I'd go. I had just celebrated my eighteenth birthday.</p> <p>My mind wandered off to places I'd never gone before. I started to feel a headache coming on. I was about to fall asleep when I felt a finger touch my right earhole.</p> <p>"Relax, love," my lover's whispered voice.</p> <p>I closed my eyes, opened my eyes and looked at the ceiling. It was dark. It was cloudy. I took a deep breath and closed my eyes again.</p> <p>A few seconds later, I felt a warm mouth envelope my left earlobe between my ear and neck. The sensation of lips moving down there was wonderful. The taste of peppermint was strong. Like a sweet strawberry. The soundless, warm mouth moved over the base of each ear. The warm lips slowly made their way downwards, toward my neck.</p> <p>I could not contain my sounds as my friend's mouth found my exposed skin. I could feel lips moving around my neck as the other kissed the small of my back and nibbled on my collar bones. It had turned into a pleasurable torture.</p> <p>Then my neck was kissed. At first, it was a light kiss. Slowly I felt a warm wet tongue move along the crease of my left buttock and start its journey towards my navel.</p> <p>Slowly the warm mouth kissed and licked all over my ass, the crack and the back of my thighs. Then it began to probe my hole by pulling my legs towards me and opening them a little. It took a few tries to fit a tongue inside but I was a virgin there. After two or three attempts, I felt myself relaxing and enjoying the feeling of my lover's tongue and mouth inside my hole. Eventually, it began to move upwards and I felt it inside me.</p> <p>As it entered me, my lover's other lips followed it down. They kissed each other's asses as the warm tongue explored them.</p> <p>Then I felt the lips on my anus move upwards a little more.</p> <p>After two attempts, I felt it beginning to enter me.</p> <p>It had been several seconds before the tongue entered me. I was feeling the warm, wet tongue penetrate me and move my vagina. It moved upwards, but did not find my prostate.</p> <p>I started to feel hot and moist. But I was not sure about my own comfort level. How could I have enjoyed the sensation without having to try to push my own erection inside the tight pussy that was currently in my pussy.</p> <p>Then it entered me again. There was no hesitation now.</p> <p>It seemed very strange, but my lover's other mouth was moving over my body. So many emotions were running through my mind. I thought this was just another part in my introduction to sex. It would not be until just before the end of the summer, if my lover was ever to return to school, that I would have to admit how much I enjoyed being a lover to myself.</p> <p>It was the most wonderful thing that could possibly happen to me before my college graduation, but there was a certain risk in enjoying it as I was the only one available to be my lover and I could not take risks. Besides, I knew what was about to happen wouldn't hurt any other girl I could bring into my bed.</p> <p>As the tongue slid into me, it seemed an impossible ordeal. The tongue had to be the most comfortable and satisfying. The pleasure of having a foreign tongue pleasuring my body was intoxicating. It felt warm, it was pleasant and I had always found it highly erotic and erotic having a foreign tongue in my place. I was now on my own journey of pleasure. I could feel my clitoris rubbing against the tongue as I continued to lie on top of my lover.</p> <p>I was still on top of my lover after only a few short minutes, but the pleasure from the tongue and the tongue in my mouth was becoming more intense. I was now on top of my lover's body. There was no stopping me now and I started to have a very vigorous, uncontrollably, extremely intense orgasm. The tongue did magical movements into my vagina made it's way into my body and I was in and the most intimate regions. The pleasures were giving in the pleasures of our bodies as my body. I never wanting to the body.
