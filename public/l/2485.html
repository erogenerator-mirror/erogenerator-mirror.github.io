And what did I want?</p> <p>The old woman had asked, "Is sex better than God?"</p> <p>"Yes, God, I think it's better."</p> <p>She smiled, thinking how to bring on the discussion and get that conversation out of her head. "Does it really work?"</p> <p>"The gods have a different purpose in God's eyes at any time."</p> <p>"So it must have something to do with sex. But sex is what we call Sex,</p> <p>and we know what we really should want so they don't expect us to get off with sex</p> <p>."</p> <p>"So is it sex, and you are not ready?"</p> <p>"I haven't taken the plunge. But I don't know what else to do."</p> <p>She looked at the table. "Did you come here because your family had a good time?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Then is it sex or what?"</p> <p>This was all new to him. It was new in the way people saw themselves. "That doesn't mean I should think about that at all."</p> <p>"You know, I've never been really sexually repressed. That's my thing. When I saw my sister, I just thought, if my sister had a big clit-like thing with it, you'd like it."</p> <p>"How can she tell?"</p> <p>"All her friends are bigger. She said she found it in herself that way and when the boys took her hand, she had to put her pussy over it. It was in me."</p> <p>"It must be a thing. For me to not have known it, it's really hard for me. But I'm sure it would seem the same in women, and, it's not hard, and I'm not like she is. So I guess I guess I can do this."</p> <p>"It can be really hard for you if the male organ is a penis, but not in that way, you know. It's more intense, and I think people have sexier, you know."</p> <p>"Don't think of me, all men, as someone like a slut or a freak or something. You think your penis is just small, but it's really something. Just be careful, if you want to,</p> <p>you just just do a quick blow-job."</p> <p>"Can I think about that?"</p> <p>"Yes, because I've been thinking about it, and I just can't get it through my head. I love your penis. You've got the most handsome features, and I like it. But right now, it's just sex and pleasure. And if I get off, just put your penis in me, and I can get my clit in and get off. You will be in no hurry, and I'd love to do anything we can, I just don't know what it is."</p> <p>"Can I see it?"</p> <p>She wanted to see it, and had a small, half-moon. He had a lovely, clear-jawed penis.</p> <p>She sat up. It was not a long thing, maybe three inches, and slightly thicker than her wrist. When she slid down it went into her mouth. She felt she was starting to get wet between the legs and reached for his penis. "If I come back to this position, it's only right for the boys, because I'm sure if I stay there, I'll be thinking about going down. But you know I can't."</p> <p>He stood up. "Don't you mind? I was just thinking about it."</p> <p>"I want to. Just because I have to, but I don't know. I can't go down like this." She had on her bathrobe, which did nothing for the overall effect because it exposed a good deal more cleavage than her shoulders. He could get used to that and wanted to too. She wasn't about to let a man look for long and take the easy way out.</p> <p>"If you want to go down, just put your penis in me for me?"</p> <p>"I don't think you'll have that problem."</p> <p>To her shame, she couldn't stand how he responded. It was her fault, and she had to admit, it was very embarrassing. How would he respond if he looked at her? "I just want to let you see it."</p> <p>and get it inside me if you are okay."</p> <p>and then I'm sure you want to go down for a second time,</p> <p></p> <p>and if you will</p> <p>and will to get you can</p> <p>"But I'mâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
