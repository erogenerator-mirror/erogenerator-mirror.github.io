English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter XLIII. Manly Prudence.</h4><p><strong>This discourse is very important. In “Beyond Good and Evil” we hear often enough that the select and superior man must wear a mask, and here we find this injunction</strong>, that is for his use in the future.”</p> <p>He paused for some time and looked down at her as if in an effort not to interrupt, her eyes were still on the page, her lips were drawn back from her face but now the upper part of her face was just visible. His hand reached across the table to unzip his fly, her expression was still on the paper but she looked up at him; the paper was full of nothing. The chair was so long that she was now sitting there facing the Professor, his head on one hand, the other straightening in his lap. His voice brought a smile across her face.</p> <p>“Well Mrs. McEwan, shall we? Shall we continue on with what is to come today?” He smiled. The expression that crossed her face was one of surprise.”</p> <p>“We can’t”, she said aloud, without thinking, “we’d be so out of our comfort.” Suddenly she felt a wave of relief. Not only did he want to fuck her but also he wanted her to be able to stand, she could, and she could.</p> <p>“Mrs. McEwan,” he continued, “I promise you if you’ll be a good girl I’m going to shove my cock up your ass.”</p> <p>Her face was already blushing and her voice a little weak as she nodded her understanding. She got up quickly and stood up. He watched the sway of her hips for a minute or two, then sat his coffee with his paper, taking an uncertain look at her to see where this was all leading.</p> <p>His words almost touched her. She was trembling now despite herself, then he smiled again and told her,</p> <p>“It’s been a while but I think maybe you can do it. You don't have to worry about the price. After my cock goes up your ass I’ll come down here and fuck you till I come. I promise you I won’t pull out. I can even tell a little if I come in your ass.” He took his hands away from the table and placed them on her hips to steady her when she went back to his paper. He slid down her body, between her legs, and her hands came up along his thighs. He stopped just an inch or so short of her asshole, just a breath away from fucking her.</p> <p>“Mrs McEwan,” he said softly. “You don’t have to worry about the price, its only a small price. Do you want me to shove up your ass?”</p> <p>Her head came up to meet his eyes, she looked up at him and spoke. “Yes, I do know that.”</p> <p>His answer surprised her. “But my cock is already up your ass. So why should you worry about the price.”</p> <p>His words shocked her, so much so that she looked away again.</p> <p>“I don’t know. It’ll feel good to have a man’s cock in my ass.”</p> <p>“Is it still a virgin”?</p> <p>“Very tight”.</p> <p>“I know, because I’ve never done it before. I’ve never wanted to do that because that would make it harder and it might make it less painful.” She looked at him closely then looked around the room. “Maybe I’ll try it, but I haven’t had a cock up there in a long time.”</p> <p>“Not exactly. Let me show you how to do it Mrs. McEwan,” he said firmly and then his hand went down to her ass. He could feel her tense up again, then she let her lower lip go and nodded. He smiled wickedly and held her hips firmly. He began to move his finger up and down around her asshole. “I’ll show you how to feel it better Mrs. McEwan," he said as he put some saliva on his hand and began to insert his finger.</p> <p>Her ass was tight around his finger, very tight but the pleasure of his finger going in and out of her ass almost more than she felt. With both hands she moved her ass, so his finger went in just a bit deeper. They were both smiling at the pleasure that his finger was providing. And yet he didn’t take the plunge. He leaned down and kissed her full on her open lips just a couple of tongue. “like a French kisses.” and then with his own tongue pressed his. The French and the French kiss was as he pushed his tongue to her.</p> <p>L”like a kiss”, and his tongue—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
