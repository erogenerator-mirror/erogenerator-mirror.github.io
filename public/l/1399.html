What lay heaviest on my mind was, the</strong> very first time I ever did it with a real good dildo? I'd never done it at home with any other girl, and as it was the first time I ever had, I did not even think about the other 'experiments' that other men might have done with me, or my own experiences in bed with a girl. But still, to think I'd done it with a real man? To wonder about it in the dark under the covers on my own bed?</p> <p>I was sure I'd screwed my brains out during the whole night, but if I'd done it later, I may have made it again. And if I had, I know so could many people. And maybe even many women! I'm no psychologist, but I would have to remember to try to please my own gender before I really believed I could achieve it. And I'd have to take an occasional course in psychology, as I do many of my students. And I'd need to be able to do it well without any self-consciousness. So, if I went in the dark once, as most people don't, even though I did not know it beforehand, I definitely still had the advantage at least.</p> <p>So, I began with a good, warm, wet, wet tongue. A few words and little gasps when it was over, and perhaps a couple gentle, affectionate licks when the tongue was long enough to find my anus, and a little nibble when it was not to the littlest of kisses when I didn't have the courage to make eye contact, which might have also been at least a minor one to me.</p> <p>"No, just gently fuck my butt again!" I murmured, "And just slide into me if you choose."</p> <p>And the feeling of him slowly filling me, felt as wonderful as that first cock. I mean, I knew he was only half-way in, but the thought of his fat cock making me feel good, in my anus, was still making its way up my cunt. And, it was still warm and slippery and so hot, just having that cock in that warm, wet place inside of me sent me into another world.</p> <p>Some how, perhaps even through my imagination, I came to understand his idea of me. "You'd want me to stay like this for the whole night?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes, of course," he replied, and then he began moving in and out. Long, slow strokes, but even that made sure he got the whole of it and everything was well inside me, then slid back and forth a bit.</p> <p>"Just do it a bit," I whispered in his ear, which was very sensitive indeed. I rubbed his back, sometimes on both sides instead of just one side, but he seemed to be moving into me in much the same way as he was in mine. Just keep sliding in and out a bit, and in a very short time, his hips moved a bit, and I could feel how his whole body was moving, and the friction of his cock was getting to me.</p> <p>"There," I told him as he continued fucking me. "That's it. Now fuck me faster."</p> <p>He seemed to agree, and with some difficulty, and I felt some small, almost indescribable pleasure, the feeling of his cock deep inside me, as his whole body was moving inside me, the pleasure, as if I was being fucked, and his hips were hitting me with ever-tightenable force, moving in rhythm with mine. I just began to move with him, as if I was being fucked by a real cock and not just his. The feeling was so exciting, to just have someone really, really fuck me!</p> <p>"Yeah!" I thought to myself, "You're doing it now! You're fucking me, making love to me."</p> <p>He picked up speed and moved faster, as if he was having a great time while he did his job all over my body. Even though I'd almost finished myself, the feeling was almost as good as he already had my butt and his cock. His breathing seemed to quicken as well, as his cock seemed to grow and get larger inside me. Perhaps it was the pleasure of a young man's first time, of having another man's cock inside of me, inside a woman's butt, that led to him getting in there, not just his first time fucking me, but that young man as well. I could feel his whole body moving in rhythm with mine, and his butt was hitting me again. We kept up this kind of wild sex for probably twenty minutes or so, all of which I think I lasted at least one of, perhaps, many minutes.</p> <p></p> <p>I did like to be watched by a guy, but not many times. I might say. But some women, and others, many at one or none at least, what might be just the sameâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
