I'd managed to land four of the six leading accountants in the country's top three sectors yet we were going to double that amount.</p> <p>"Why didn't any of us do this? Why wasn't it enough?" I asked myself.</p> <p>"Well," said Marius, "there is a difference in the way people see things to be positive, than to be concerned with their own personal happiness."</p> <p>He came up behind me and placed his hands on my shoulders and pressed me to him. Our kiss was hot and passionate as his lips traveled over my face and down my neck and chest and back to my lower jaw and finally to my ear. He leaned back as my hair spilled on the floor and his hands moved to my back, pulling me closer.</p> <p>"There'll be time for that later," I said. He ran his hands down my back and over my butt and then he rested them on the tops of my butt cheeks. He slid a finger down to my dripping pussy and gently worked in and out while kissing me.</p> <p>"Is this how you're going to repay me by making me an excellent husband?" I laughed as he slipped back from kissing me, grabbed his hands and pulled him up.</p> <p>"How about that?" he nodded. He looked into my eyes, and then looked over me at the clock on the wall. "Shouldn't we go back to the first time tonight?"</p> <p>"Probably not," I agreed. "But I'm all yours, now." He grinned and moved his hands back to his pants.</p> <p>"I think you're an amazing woman."</p> <p>And just then, we were both suddenly interrupted by a knock at my door.</p> <p>"Hey, I came with a surprise."</p> <p>The two guys in the doorway were surprised and they sat on the other side of the living room. That confused me. Usually if a customer comes in with an offer of beer on a Saturday night, we leave a customer up to the buyer, but today the two guys sat on the loveseat with just two customers.</p> <p>I took a drink of beer and a joint from my beer and handed it to him. He turned back to me and we both took a hit. We smoked the joint for a bit and smiled at each other. It hit his lungs and his eyes began to close, and we were back to being good friends.</p> <p>We went down on our knees on the love seat and began to kiss again. Our tongues mingled passionately and I leaned down to place my lips over his ear and ear. I pushed his hair back and down, giving him as much access as I could to my tongue. I pushed my hands up over his tie and pulled it and his shirt off. His chest was hard and muscle as I kissed down his chest and then down to his nipples. His hands dropped from my shoulders to my hair as I tickled his nipples.</p> <p>I lowered my lips back to his and we continued to kiss as our hands stroked over each other's body. Our fingers found each other's pussy's as our kisses grew more heated. His fingers found my clitoris and he stroked it lightly. We broke our kiss and his hand came down to my butt. He pulled me into his lap, his erect cock nestled between my ass cheeks.</p> <p>"Let's see how great you can sit on a rock" I laughed as I pushed my ass back against him and then I lifted my leg. His hand slipped off my pussy and his fingers began to dip down.</p> <p>I felt his fingers press slightly against my pussy, and then his cock slipped into me as a thick digit pushed against my asshole.</p> <p>"That's it, put some pressure," I said. "Make me cum."</p> <p>He slipped one hand between us. His finger pushed into my pussy as his cock moved more fully into me. His mouth covered my mouth again. I let one of my hands drop to the wall of the loveseat, as my other hand moved up and up my body along the wall. When one of his hands reached my left breast, the right one went to my clit. His hand began to slide in and out and then he pulled his finger out and pushed back in. His tongue moved to my ear and his hand on my clit. His mouth moved to my neck and we were kissing again. He slowly broke the kiss. We moved to the couch.</p> <p></p> <p>"Oh, how, how I'm, the way", look at last, oh look", he put his arms. I grabbed the arms on the coffee, and and had his arms.</p> <p>"Look".</p> <p></p> <p>I looked—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
