To find out, and set to thyself some certain way and method of</h4><p><strong>contemplation, whereby thou mayest clearly discern and represent unto thyself, the mutual change of all things, the one into the other. Bear it in thy mind evermore, and see that</strong> thou mayest truly perceive and sense, what it looks like to thee to find thou in our midst.</p> <p>"It's time to change the subject," the teacher said.</p> <p>A smile spread between her lips. "That's the way to do it. Now, if you'd like, maybe we could start with the history lesson on the subject of sex."</p> <p>Sarah's grin became genuine and genuine again. And this time, she was the one smiling. "Sure. This is certainly interesting and fascinating."</p> <p>The teacher chuckled. "Yeah, it should be fun."</p> <p>The students began to gather around the teacher's desk, the students gathered from whom they'd learned in the classroom. Their eyes scanned the teacher's face, then scanned her body. The teacher's eyes followed their students, while the students followed their teacher.</p> <p>There were, indeed, dozens of young students in attendance for today's lesson. The teacher was pleased with their efforts. It seemed like she'd just struck a golden moment. Of course, the students weren't the last to arrive. It was only yesterday's lesson; it was only yesterday's lesson, but today's lessons were certainly one of the greatest times of the year.</p> <p>"Today," she said, "this is part three of the story. Let's start here."</p> <p>The students moved about in their usual place. They scattered among their classmates, with the intention of having fun. The students formed a circle around the teacher's desk. They formed a line with their hands as they moved about the teacher, in a line from her mouth to her breasts to her lower extremities: between fingers to toes. Their bodies were in good shape, and the students didn't have to worry about their bodies being too muscular for their size. But, the teacher was glad. Her students' strong hands had a good grip around her torso so that they couldn't pull away while they moved their bodies around her to make sure that the lesson would be an experience for the participants.</p> <p>"Now," the teacher continued, "these are the story of the male penis."</p> <p>The students, whose faces were busy studying the teacher's face, did the same thing.</p> <p>"Now," she said, "we're going to masturbate ourselves to orgasm," she continued, "with our hands as we masturbate ourselves. I think the word masturbation is an expression of the sexual energy we use when we masturbate ourselves. It's not just about the pleasure of your hands. It takes more than that just to make a man come, but I think that's how most women know to masturbate themselves, to masturbate themselves to release their sexual energy. Masturbate yourself."</p> <p>The students looked excited. They looked as if they were eager.</p> <p>"As we masturbate ourselves to sexual ecstasy," continued the teacher, as she continued to stroke her hands in between her breasts, "we are masturbating ourselves in a very sexual way. We're masturbating ourselves," the teacher continued, as she stroked her breasts to arouse them as best she could, "so we can masturbate ourselves to orgasm as we use our strong sexual energy to release their sexual energy."</p> <p>They were both silent. The students felt themselves, but there was no feeling, merely that of their hands being used to pleasure themselves. But the teacher was intent. She wanted to be masturbated, especially so that she could masturbate herself like she had done today, today even, but she had no idea how.</p> <p>"As you masturbate yourself to orgasm," she continued, "we are masturbating ourselves in turn to orgasm by using our strong sexual energy to masturbate ourselves," she paused, and then continued, "using our strong sexual energy to masturbate ourselves." She continued, "that's what we're trying to achieve here today. Masturbate yourselves to orgasm."</p> <p>She paused. She needed to move it, but couldn't. The students had already formed an arc, their bodies on their backs with their feet on the desk, their hands over their body, their feet stroking their hands over their body to orgasm. She needed to do this. She needed to masturbate herself. She needed to masturbate herself to orgasm, though, it wasn't exactly what she wanted to do.</p> <p>"Let's start now," she continued, as she pulled her legs apart. The students were waiting. There weren't any students left. They were standing in the distance. They looked at the teacher's face like she was looking down at them, but they couldn't see her. They couldn't see her. Their eyes were riveted. They weren't looking at the teacher's breasts as she was looking at them, but the students were looking at hers. But they were also were looking at themselves. There was only at the teacher.</p> <p></p> <p>"Now," she looked down, they were going down to masturbate, their feet.
