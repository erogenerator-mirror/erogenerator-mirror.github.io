He paced up and down his room, now turning his thoughts on a difficult problem and frowning, now</strong> he knew what to do about it. He sat up and took the coffee cup from his hand, the soft warm taste on his tongue. He smiled as he tasted himself on the hot stickiness and a slight groan escaped his lips, he loved the feel of his hard dick jostling for breath. He took the mugful of coffee into his hand and gave himself a sip, watching his sweetie squirm under his touch.</p> <p>"Good morning, sweetheart! Coffee is good! I'm having a wonderful Christmas to remember." He watched her sleep, his eyes drifting to the clock on the nightstand. "What's that on the clock?" he asked to be a little more specific.</p> <p>"Oh, just a gift for Santa for the party I went to today." She yawned, making him smile.</p> <p>"Ah, well, it was a party in my house... with a girlfriend there. I don't know why." He yawned again, "I just want to put it back on and take a nap." He smiled again, still a little shy.</p> <p>"You seem like a very nice boy from the party." He noticed her snuggled into her pillows, feeling happy for not being the only one in her room. He didn't want to embarrass her in the way she'd told him she wanted it.</p> <p>"I'm not," she replied, looking up at him and smiling, "you know it's perfectly sweet of you to say that." She sighed, her body shivering slightly from his touch. He leaned over and put the spoon back in the spoon holder, his face turning towards her. He placed the spoon into the holder and looked up into her eyes. She smiled as he leaned over and kissed her lips and chin.</p> <p>"Good morning," he said as he lifted the spoon in his hand.</p> <p>"Good morning, dear." She sat up and leaned into him for an embrace, pushing against him, sliding her body against his, grinding herself over his cock, grinding it against his thigh. He placed the spoon back into the holder and turned it off. "I'm ready to be up now," he said and took the spoon from her hands. He kissed her, tasting her, his tongue in her mouth, he felt his hand slide up and feel her breast, her nipple already hard under his palm. He placed the spoon in the holder, holding her breast and gently massaging her nipple between his fingers.</p> <p>She placed her hand on the back of his neck, pulling him closer, kissing him with all her strength. He sucked her tongue, feeling his erection becoming more swollen and ready for her. He slowly pressed against her so his dick was pressing into her crotch. He pulled back from the kiss and looked deep in her eyes, knowing her desire was greater than need and passion. He pressed against her and pulled her closer against him, his lips on hers. He kissed her deeply as he wrapped his arms around her, holding her close to him. He felt her body begin to shudder against his, and his cock began to get harder and stiff as it grew against her.</p> <p>"I don't think it's possible to last, but I need you." He was breathing heavily as he looked into her eyes, "let go, I'm ready, let go."</p> <p>She released him, and he pushed himself away from her, standing and falling onto his bed. He watched her go down on her stomach as she rolled over and looked up at him. He smiled at her as she took his dick in her hand and began to lick the head of him with slow, tender strokes. She moved lower, running her tongue over his sack, rolling it over his sack. She took his dick into her mouth again and swirled her tongue over the head. She slid her lips down the shaft and began to suck it lightly, sliding her mouth up and down, getting more and more of his member into her mouth. He moaned, his body trembling with desire. She moaned as he pushed his hips, meeting her rhythm.</p> <p>He gripped her hips, pushing into her as she bobbed up and down, taking more and more of his member into her. He moaned in pleasure as her mouth pleasured his dick, making him moan louder. She pulled her mouth off of him and looked over his dick, making him look at her as she sucked it. She looked up, smiling as she licked the head of his dick.</p> <p>"Oh you love that, don't you honey," she said as she took it back into her mouth to give it a gentle stroke. He moaned, his head thrashing in pleasure, "You look up and down as she took his shaft, looking at him as she slid her mouth up and down.</p> <p></p> <p>his shaft, licking it, sucking it, "let him, making you knowâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
