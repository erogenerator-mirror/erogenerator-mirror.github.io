His valet had crept several times on tiptoe into the room to see if he was stirring, and had wondered what made</strong> him awaken and wake in the dim light. So now he knew. He would make love to that woman again.</p> <p>No. Please.</p> <p>He wanted to fuck her again. He wanted her to be happy. He wanted his mouth on her, his cock inside her, and he wanted to be as happy as he was with her.</p> <p>He slid to his knees on the bed a bit unsteady, and got onto his hands and knees. It took a bit of courage to stand up, but he managed to get his belt unbuckled, undid his jeans, and pulled them, and his underwear, off, his cock bouncing free. The dress came off next; her bra hit the floor next. She still wore the black panties he had seen her in; he realized it was almost impossible to see her nipples through them.</p> <p>She came to the bed, laying down and pulling her legs up. She reached between them, pulled a pillow under her face, and opened her thighs to him. Oh yes. Now his cock came to point back at her pussy in the darkness as he entered her. She guided it into her and he pushed himself into her, taking her a bit at a time at which he couldn't have stopped himself even if he'd wanted to. He was in a tight spot, but in an intimate way, and felt somehow very right. She took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and her back bowed slightly to his hands pressing her butt down firmly back onto him. He was in to her deep, wet channel, and the thought was so erotic it was almost electric. He loved the fact that she was going down so smoothly with him. They kissed hard, tongues intertwined. It was a very different position from him, yet the physical intimacy it was making was like no other.</p> <p>He wasn't sure if it was possible to fall asleep as he was, even though it couldn't have come naturally for them in the position they were in, so he lay back down on his back and got hold of his cock.</p> <p>Suddenly he felt like he could not breathe. This was incredible. He didn't know whether it was the wine, but something else was going through it, like it was a wave of electricity or something. He felt as if he might drown if he moved his cock in her. He looked at her, naked except for her panties. He loved the way she looked fucking him like this because of all those years of wanting to fuck her. And now she was looking at him, naked like that and she was loving it.</p> <p>She wanted him.</p> <p>He kissed her and began stroking her hair. She was still asleep, so he didn't care. He wanted her badly and he would love for her, and she would love him for him, and she would love him for him. He kept saying those words to himself, wishing that all the sex he and her had had at the club, and here he was, at last, at the top of it all, standing, his cock in her vagina.</p> <p>She opened her eyes. Then she reached for him and he took her hand and helped her rise up onto her knees. His cock was still in her. She reached for him again and this time they got to it. He started in and out of her slowly at first, but she was so tight and wet, her insides feeling his cock slide into the most exciting space imaginable by so sudden, if not entirely, for someone who had never had anal sex with her and who had never been fucked by her at all. He took her in his arms and kissed her and fondled her. He ran his hands up and down her body from her breasts to her waist, and along her thighs. She had a nice figure down her bellybutton and his cock was going deep into her vagina as he continued fucking her. Her breasts were big, her body fit his body with their buoyancy and her nipples had hardened so much he could barely hold them. She was on a mission - he thought.</p> <p>He reached for her waist and pulled her down onto his cock, and they started moving in sync, he had the feeling of her going slow and him going fast. He could feel the pleasure in their skin, the tightness of muscle and muscle, the way her legs went round him whenever she moved with him, and he had felt like this all his life, from the first time he could remember. She had never liked to ride him to orgasm, she'd never done the missionary position (it was very awkward), never had been able to get in that position, and she certainly never had felt him penetrate her, not like this, not like in the hotel. Buttons & Buttons, She knew him in various sexual positions well, he and, felt her most he and he could think of his cock, he could be a lot of many things, they were. She liked to see herâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
