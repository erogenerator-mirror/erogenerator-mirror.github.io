The consequence was, that when the moon, which was full and bright</strong>, finally came up, it would be bright, warm, clear and pleasant, a whole new kind of day.</p> <p>The curtains fell in soft silence, as we began our sex session, and soon my fingers were pumping up and down, while my tongue was licking and lapping at his balls, which were so large I couldn’t understand how I was managing to keep my tongue away from his cock-head, which stood at a frightening angle up the length of my tongue. When I touched my clit, I knew this would be a mistake. It was always a huge mistake not to make myself cum right away, in preparation for the explosion that might be coming.</p> <p>I don’t know why I hadn’t, yet as I imagined the scene of the old movies, and as I saw two guys, one in a swimming costume, and one of them naked, fucking one of the other, right in front of me.</p> <p>I reached down and began playing with myself, as I imagined the action, as I kept up with the action of my hands on my breasts and the other in my cunt. While the guy on the other end had his cock all the way in my mouth, I kept imagining that it came out of my mouth in the other end of the cock, which I knew was just the way.</p> <p>When my breathing became more rapid, I was right on the edge, but I wanted to get on my way. I was so wet and ready and I wanted to cum quickly. I was so horny and so ready and so wet, and of course I would just have to wait until the guys had cum.</p> <p>I slid my fingers out of my hole, and immediately I placed them in my mouth and put my mouth over the end of them, and sucked on them, my tongue still sliding over them. I could taste the pre-cum, and I sucked it in, as I used my lips and tongue to caress his cock, before sliding them over the head, where I put the tip of my tongue before running it round it on the end.</p> <p>"Ohhh!!!," he moaned, pulling my head to him and pushing his cock into my wet and sticky throat again and again, as I sucked hard, taking more and more of his shaft into my mouth. Just like before, I felt him getting hard in my mouth and he started thrusting in and out of my mouth. At this point I didn’t really know what to do, I just wanted him to cum in my mouth and get out of this little scene, I wanted to cum so badly.</p> <p>A few minutes passed, the guy on the other end of his cock had his orgasm and the guy in front had his cum splashing into the sea. It went on and on, and as my mouth had taken a turn on his cock, it seemed to me that he had the biggest cum I’d ever had. I felt like I was sucking a cock, as it was like the most powerful thing on earth!</p> <p>When the guys had finished cumming, I removed my fingers from my mouth, and my mouth just kept right on sucking on him as I heard the guy in the background let out a sigh.</p> <p>"Wow! That felt so good," he said as he pulled the cock out of my horny mouth, and turned me round slowly and turned me around. We kissed once again as our bodies made contact again, just like our first time.</p> <p>I’m sure that we wouldn’t be apart after this night, but somehow this was my opportunity to do something new. It was an opportunity that I just couldn’t pass up, in order to fulfil my desires. So I told him to stay where he was, that I’d want him inside me soon after our date.</p> <p>As soon as I felt his arms around me, as he pulled me closer to him, I knew that I just had to have him inside me!</p> <p>It seemed so easy, as I kept on my knee, and slowly my dress came off. I had forgotten to put my panties on, and when he pulled me close to him, I grabbed his shoulders and held him tightly as I looked into his eyes. What we were both waiting for right now, just a few moments ago, was what we both really wanted, that what we both hoped for, and now, finally, our sex had just started.</p> <p>I told him that now would be as good an opportunity for us to get married, as having it as we did. As I said this, my skirt fell to the floor, leaving me standing in just my panties, my body so inviting, so beautiful and so moist.</p> <p>liant. I wanted him inside me. When he pulled me close again, I was totally, so very firmly, very deep, so that I thought of, I just let himself feel the pressure, I was him—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
