A man, a man dressed in a green suit from suit jacket to slacks and blouse, his back to the road, looked down at them, a smile playing across his lips. He spoke. “This man,” said Anna, “is Countess Anterim,” she smiled. Anna nodded. He spoke again. “This is Anna Marie Ostermouz. He lives in Vienna. We should not have come this way. We have been at this place until too late. If we have to go we will know it is late.” He leaned forward and offered Anna his hand. He shook it. He looked at Anna. She smiled at him.</p> <p>“The next man to your right is my cousin. He is the leader of the German police force. He has been assigned as the officer of honor and he will be your partner.” Anna smiled at it. “I have never thought about it.”</p> <p>“Are you sure you don’t have a name?" Anna asked him.</p> <p>I don’t. I have this name… ” He said it, and she nodded. Then he turned and looked at something in the grass. Then he looked at something else. “This is… a… a big…” he said. The words hung in the air until Anna raised the glass from it. She smiled again at him as he raised his glass to hers for a toast.</p> <p>Anna was standing close to Belial and her son. He leaned into her and kissed her cheek. Their lips met, his arms going around her and pulling her close against him, his kiss, and their embrace intensified.</p> <p>Anna stood facing Belial now. His hands came down from around her back to her hips, his fingers brushing over her round buttocks. Belial leaned his body to Anna and kissed her mouth. Anna’s breath came in short gasps, her head shaking back and forth as she looked up at the man who was kissing this woman she loved more than her children. Anna’s hands slid down Belial’s body to his waist and slowly kneaded his strong, muscular buttocks. She could feel his cock pressing against her stomach.</p> <p>The room was quiet. Belial’s arms came up and pulled Anna against him. She let her arms slide down, letting him pull her hands up to his shoulders. Then she began to unbutton his shirt, his shirt, as she slid his shirt off his hairy back. He stepped back from her, pulling the shirt from her shoulders. She let him unbutton her blouse. They were both breathing heavily. They fell in a long embrace to the right of her and Belial. Their lips met again, Belial’s hands cupping her breasts and Anna feeling how he would grope them as she squeezed him to her.</p> <p>Belial pulled her skirt and panties down over the bottom of her hips. He stepped back from her slowly and held the panties up to expose her vagina just long enough. He stepped back. Anna reached for her panties, but Belial gently grabbed them from her hands. Belial stood in front of her, his feet on the ground, his arms about her. Anna watched, her eyes wide. She felt herself becoming nervous. She felt Belial’s cock against her vagina. Her heart pounded in her chest as Belial’s cock pushed against her. She leaned forward and whispered.</p> <p>“Kiss me,” she said and Belial did. Belial pulled her to him and kissed her. Anna’s heart raced and she felt herself go weak from passion but Belial felt her passion. Their tongues caressed and danced as they pulled each other towards the climax of their kissing. Their hands moved together, one hand touching, the other fondling. Then Belial moved Anna back so she was lying on the grass, bent her at the waste and began to kiss her neck, first running his tongue in small nibbles and then a kiss. Anna closed her eyes. Belial’s tongue moved down to her breasts. He licked first one then the other before taking her nipple into his mouth and sucking it as he lifted it away from her breast. Anna gasped. Belial’s cock seemed to grow as he felt the softness of her body. He placed her leg over his hip. Belial’s cock rubbed against her vagina. Anna was sure she felt it at the top of her vagina and it felt as hot on the tip of his cock. Belial could smell her perfume.</p> <p></p> <p>Belial reached his hand into Anna’s pants and slid his finger inside her panties until he felt her wet and began to her clitoris clitoris penis. Her clitoris. He touched Belial vagina. He slid inside her clitoris clitoris vagina—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
