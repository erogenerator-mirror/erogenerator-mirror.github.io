The Dappled Grays</h4><p><strong>The baron, followed by the count, traversed a long series of apartments, in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth, until he reached the</strong> second bedroom across the hall from Miss Goudray's personal ward, where his first sight, and his last for life memory, was those of his own mother.</p> <p>By the time of his passing, his mother was only six months older than Daphne. She had married a year prior to leaving high school, and was at once bored, sexually excited, and as excited as she was pregnant that they went on a trip of their own, to a "giantly sexy and well-practiced" fashion magazine publisher.</p> <p>She was also happy to take in a beautiful-looking boy she had known from college, in the way that she had seen in a movie and had been to a strip club, for her and a boy when she was just twelve. And a lot of young guys, for that matter. But she also had a son, who knew that she thought of him as a boy, who treated her like a daughter.</p> <p>Her father had been there as well, helping her pick out clothing, and teaching her what she liked about boys to give her the confidence she needed to get laid. So as they stood there in her bedroom in their new suits and matching ties, Gennady walked over to the bed, and told herself: "Come and stand at my head." Of course it was always a bit hard -- especially when in reality it took her a long time to figure it out -- but if she could just be on her knees, she decided. And if she had known the boy would be the sort of guy whose first name was the "Prince" by his first name, she would have thought that she would have learned it by now.</p> <p>Her father looked at her in the mirror, wondering what to do. She had a way of doing things just right, even with him, which always pleased his wife. Her breasts never seemed more voluptuous, with her erect nipples pointing up at the ceiling. They were always well endowed if they were not so shy. And of course she liked everything she had: her long legs, her sexy thighs, her slim waist, her gorgeous butt, her beautiful smile, her wonderful smile. But when she wanted something else than she had been able to obtain without having some small amount of effort. Or maybe a small bit.</p> <p>But she was not a young woman and if she was the type of boy his only choice would surely be to be a little more experienced in bed.</p> <p>So he turned off the light and told himself to let her do the rest. Then he stood at her head with his back to her, then slowly lowered himself on the bed, and she gently put her hands on his muscular shoulders, and then slowly and rhythmically slid them up her arms and kissed them over them.</p> <p>"Oh my, Daddy!" Gennady whispered so softly. "I'm so happy you are taking your time, and I hope you'll do this for me, too!" And her hand crept up his chest, her fingers caressing his thick, muscular chest, until she was lightly caressing his nipples. Then it was Gennady's turn to be amazed by her father's strong hands... so strong! But he was surprised at her hands, both on his chest and on his nipples.</p> <p>"But you do have such a sexy touch," she said. Now her father did have some "big" hands, he thought. But he was not sure how to get to that point. But he decided to use a trick he had learned about herself on a few occasions with his son, and that was when she'd let him massage her shoulders.</p> <p>Then he moved to her arms, until his hands felt more like fingers than thumbs. They had the same firmness, especially when he massaged the upper and lower part of her shoulders.</p> <p>"Oh!" she said when his hands slid under her arms to her shoulders.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Just touch my hair here!" Gennady said, and suddenly felt her mane of long hair tickling her upper chest. "This is so relaxing!"</p> <p>Then his hands moved down her neck. "Your breasts are lovely!" he told himself. And so was her nipples. She had very little to show for the size of her breasts, and even their erectness was not visible between the gauzy gown and her long sleeve.</p> <p>And when his hands slid down her shoulders, and his hands felt even more warm skin for the first time, Gennady took hold of his hands to let him touch her breasts.</p> <p>"That feels so good," she whispered. "Now rub my breasts for me!"</p> <p>And so his fingers slid up her sides, down and up her ribs, which she let him touch hers, and caressed her skin on the shape and the softness of her body, and curves like arouse her arms and her body, caressing the hard nipples and her nipplesâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
