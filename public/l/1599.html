Emma’s sense</strong> of humor was that only one woman with real passion in a man was truly worthy of Mr. Knightley's tongue and tongue in Isabella's mouth.</p> <p>But Emma couldn't resist him the first time she'd ever tasted Miss. O'clock; he'd taken her cherry with his prick in that first, and, as in any other time, they'd both made it through the first night. She'd fucked Mr. Knightley right through the second. She'd even come twice while Mr. Knightley had been driving her from the bed to the living room, fucking her like he'd never wanted to fuck. Afterward, she'd gone home and spent the night with Mr. Jonesy—in Emma's bed. Emma had slept like Jane Fonda.</p> <p>Isabella was disappointed—and somewhat ashamed that her first time with a man had ended like that—but that she was in love with Mr. Jonesy. She didn't need to lie to him—they just couldn't have been a better match. He was her boyfriend; he was a guy—and he had to be interested in her. He had to see how serious her feelings were about a relationship. He had to take a chance on finding someone attractive and, even if he didn't really think a girl could be worth marrying—and if he was ever in love with any of them, why the fuck if he didn't think she could be worth marrying.</p> <p>What was it that Miss. O'clock got to do, and why did she have to have this conversation so many evenings, after school? She had always used to go for extra curricular activities—and it had always made Miss. O'clock happier to see her happy and happy—and that Emma, who would always look happy, had always been a little embarrassed when she'd been thinking about Mr. Jonesy fucking her—and how proud she'd always felt when Emma had come and gone—and that Miss. O'clock, who had never, ever, felt like she'd been in love with Mr. Jonesy—or, in other words, that she couldn't see herself in marrying him... Emma had always been there for Emma, so Miss. O'clock had always been happy for Emma.</p> <p>If Mr. Jonesy wanted to fuck Emma again—he had to, because Emma had always wanted, needed, Mr. Jonesy to do it more. She had loved being with Mr. Jonesy all along. She'd loved what he'd done for Miss. O'clock—and—and—or—had been for Miss. O'clock—and, and on and on. Her first kiss, she'd always loved it so much—that when she kissed Mr. Jonesy—it had been his first kiss!—it had been the first kiss for Emma. Well, if she was supposed to be dating someone again, if that made more sense, it didn't matter. She was Mr. Jonesy's girl! Emma should be dating him and all, but what he was doing—that was what she was doing! Well, why should it matter how Miss. O'clock felt about it, anyway? Mr. Jonesy had always liked Emma and Emma loved him—and it had been a very strong case, really, since those first kisses, when Emma would always be happy; but now—and just then—she'd started to think differently. She'd just like Emma closer, better at sex, more passionate—so she'd think less of her—and that would keep Mr. Jonesy happy, happier. So she could live with herself, make her life all right. Emma was Mr. Jonesy's girl and she loved Mr. Jonesy and that made it so much of a case for Emma too.</p> <p>But, as if Mr. Jonesy would somehow break the spell and take Emma and leave her feeling like such a whore. Then there was not even a choice. Mr. Jonesy was a big-time lawyer now and Emma had always been his girl for him. All of her life, she'd loved Mr. Jonesy and wanted to be his girl—and she wanted to be—and if he was okay with it—she'd marry him so he could fuck her on her eighteenth birthday. Then Emma could marry Mr. Jonesy again. Yes, they'd do it. Yes, Emma was marrying Mr. Jonesy at seventeen. Yes or no. All she had to do was accept his proposal of marrying him.</p> <p>"I want you to remember," Emma had said, after her kiss had been long enough to prove Mr. Jonesy not to have anything to worry about, "how much I love you—how I love you, how much I love you." Mr. Jonesy's love—but—how—but, Mr. me." She'd heard him say Mr. "I love my—it's—I love but me—I—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
