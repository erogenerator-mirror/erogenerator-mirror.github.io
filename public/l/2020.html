That which the nature of the universe doth busy herself about, is;</h4><p><strong>that which is here, to transfer it thither, to change it, and thence again to take it away, and to carry it to another place. So that thou needest not</strong> fear. That which is here shall bring it to an abasing, that which is here shall carry it to an abasing. So that is here, to transfer it thither, to change it, and hence to take it away, and to carry it to another place."</p> <p>"Are you still in your reverie? you must be in. You must be in that which is here." She reached out, her hand coming to grasp my cock. She squeezed it firmly. "We will have a long fuck, but we will never fuck again, nor will we ever fuck again, until we are as one to take it in.</p> <p>"So just relax, and come" she smiled, "this way we shall consummate the union with joy and passion. That which is there is yours. "</p> <p>As my eyes were closed, and my heart was in my cheeks, that was how I felt. How a little time between us had taken our lust for each other, become a little more, than a little more, than a little more than a little less time. Then the moment I had envisaged, as a momentous moment, had passed by which I had suddenly felt the thrill of a thousand thousand millions, and a thousand thousand thousands, and a thousand thousand millions, and thousand thousand, that was now, suddenly, the event was a whole new world, and it seemed so to me. My mind now, to be totally immersed in the joy of sex, of fucking, would then follow by a feeling like an entirely different kind of joy, perhaps a whole new and exciting experience, if not as far as my cock in fact. If I could just go back and forth on our journey, I wanted to carry on, I wanted to carry on.</p> <p>The two of us, kissing, embracing, caressing, I had been, I, being that little moment, we both were, but I had changed my mind as a consequence of this second time, and I now had a little more feeling of her. I now felt like I wanted a change. As she kissed me, and the kiss continued for a time, but we kissed only a moment longer, before I broke the kiss, but she came and laid down beside me.</p> <p>"We shall take our time with each other, and you shall be the first. So I am going to tell how it must be done. Do not believe me, but that it is the right thing to do, but, shall we call it even, shall we call it a fuck? "</p> <p>"You mean, you are going to tell me, after I have made love to you?"</p> <p>"Yes. What am I going to do with you then?"</p> <p>"You don't really think she wants me to fuck, do you?"</p> <p>"You can do just about anything she asks, she may get up and fuck you, or you may fuck her. So, do it, because that is what she wants."</p> <p>She lay back, with her hand rubbing my thigh, and stroking my cock.</p> <p>"Just tell her that you want me to do it, you want me to do it." In my state, with the sensations she was bringing me, I felt that I could do anything, she could want it all. We both liked this.</p> <p>"I want you to do it."</p> <p>"Just make her wait. I, I want to watch."</p> <p>I lifted her, and she put her legs over my shoulders and I took my cock in, and slowly pushed. I held it with one hand, and slowly pushed in, then again held it. We both moved, very slowly, very delicately, and I did not move as I had with her mouth earlier, and I felt her body move as I took my time, and she moved as I took my time. Her hair fell in my face, her eyes were wide, as I was, I could see her beautiful breasts, as her nipples rose, as I held my cock in a steady rhythm. I closed my eyes, and she moved, and my hands moved as I took my rhythm.</p> <p>Her moans now became shorter, as she neared her second orgasm, and I slowed down my movements. I had to, and she said it again, but I had no choice. She was there, she was there, and as she cried out, as I felt her orgasm, I also felt the first jet of my cum, that I had heard of, as she had, and it was beautiful, beautiful. I was lost in the act, with her, as my own orgasm finished, as the final wave, as she felt me come, as I held my cock, until it slowly slipped from her body.</p> <p></p> <p>I was aware of her body. I could not seen her, but saw her eyes, and I could hear.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I opened my godâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
