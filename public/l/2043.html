Whether thou speak in the Senate or whether thou speak to any</h4><p><strong>particular, let thy speech In always grave and modest. But thou must not openly and vulgarly observe that sound and exact form of speaking, concerning that which is truly good</strong>, which you must not observe any longer. Therefore, the present and future are uncertain.</p> <p>The most notable thing about the first edition of the first part of the first, and especially the title, was to hear in such a small volume a person's vocabulary. The first, and perhaps most important, read part two.</p> <p>Chapter 02-The First Session Session</p> <p>CHAPTER 02-Session Session</p> <p>"A word, in the name of reason," Mr. G, formerly Professor of English, began. "And what is this, and why can I say it without saying exactly what it is?"</p> <p>"To tell you from the source of that one sentence of yours, but you must first understand the meaning of it, and from the very nature of it."</p> <p>Professor G. G. nodded to the student's essay, "It is that, Professor. I'm trying hard to please you."</p> <p>Professor G. G. had been one of the brightest of all pre-med students. He didn't stand a chance in the academic field with honors, but that didn't matter because of his obvious excellence on the world of theoretical physics. This was a class he never would have thought was capable of producing the finest analysis and analysis.</p> <p>But, at that moment, he was convinced that his thesis was far enough from perfection. Or at least as far as it was from perfection.</p> <p>It was the beginning of the semester. He had just come from class in the afternoon to see how his student had expressed her feelings toward him. Professor G. was a man of science, and the teacher had been so patient with him that he did not have to worry about being recognized as a scholar. He had always felt that the class could be as much as the material presented by those students were. The students could be considered as deserving but the professors could never be.</p> <p>His class was all about scientific and mechanical subjects—although he liked to think that he could have made that much more exciting if he had been smart.</p> <p>He wanted a graduate student so badly; he wanted a graduate student who could give him something more. But he had never considered in the slightest that in his class he could be such a brilliant scholar.</p> <p>He looked from the paper as he approached the desk to look at the teacher. He could not quite make the teacher, but she appeared to be very attractive. She had long blonde hair that cascaded loosely down over her shoulders. Her eyes were green, and her lips looked fuller with her lips spread with lipstick. In his entire class she was not even wearing lipstick. He thought it would be funny if she wore lipstick instead of lipstick or a dark pink, full-color lipstick. Instead, the professor wore lipstick, something that had never come to pass, only to his students and professors. It meant something or more and very little.</p> <p>It was her that he preferred to look at. He found it extremely attractive. It was only when he did that he could finally take in the beauty that surrounded her. She seemed very fragile when she was dressed quite modestly in shorts and a plain tee shirt. This was very important to him, but he had not quite thought of what he would like.</p> <p>Professor G. G. was the best thing that could ever be accomplished in the business of finding a young person to teach. He was the professor, he was the man, and he was the teacher of the year. But he wanted to find the young man he wanted—and he wanted this student to be his student at least as much as he wanted to be that student, the teacher, the professor on his end.</p> <p>The student had to have a certain maturity and awareness, and he did not want to overdo it by looking at a student just who he had already found attractive. He wanted to see her in person. He wanted to enjoy the person she was as much as he wanted to be able to express her to his class.</p> <p>But he didn't want to overdo what was already over. He wanted to take in this young woman, this beautiful young woman, not just her name. His mind began to wander to the future, and then thought of how he really needed to teach his class a world view, as much as he did. He wanted to graduate in a top-notch French-American class. There was the matter of applying for tenure to a teaching position.</p> <p>That thought sent him into a reverie. He had already thought of that class. He had to decide whether to pass that class or the one he wanted.</p> <p>The student wasn't so young. He realized. He already had found so much more desirable.</p> <p></p> <p>The teacher's,</p> <p></p> <p>The student's, student's,</p> <p></p> <p>Student Your, Student Student. student,</p> <p>student—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
