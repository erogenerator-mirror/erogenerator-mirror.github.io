G. Wells </h3><h4>Explanation</h4><p><strong>“So far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant richness as the Thames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw the same abundance of splendid</strong> sights, and it only took another ten seconds before the whole village was laughing...’s laughter.”</p> <p>I sat there, naked, the blood roaring in my veins. I had no idea why this was my first time feeling like this, I knew nothing about the world of women, I assumed it was some other planet. But the only thing I knew was that I wanted this moment on a level that I could never duplicate.</p> <p>The men’s cocks became erect within a moment of each other. “Fuck the village,” I thought. A moment of lusty thought turned to sexual excitement. I wanted my first time to be beautiful: to be a feeling of ecstasy, to be something that would make me cry, to feel the wetness of my pleasure as I entered into the world. I wanted it to be good. I wanted it all.</p> <p>I didn’t just want the village to do what they always do...I NEED IT. I wanted the men to be proud of me, to look at me. To feel the power of the men’s cocks. I wanted it to be glorious...and I wanted them to feel what they do.</p> <p>I looked over one shoulder and saw the villagers around me, laughing as they watched the men’s cocks as they made love with each other. “Now I know what I’m doing,” I thought. I wanted to do this for them, for them only, for them only, and for me as well because it would make this wonderful. I wanted to take on every man to whom I could find it, and they would feel my breasts as I pushed myself up higher than any and every man. I wanted them to feel the strength in me as I rose up and down in a rhythm, on one knee, then the other, and the men’s cocks.</p> <p>As I rose up to a peak, I felt myself start to orgasm. With each bounce up and down, one of those cocks was now fucking my mouth. I felt it swelling in me, sliding inside, and I sensed it coming all at once. I opened my mouth wide and felt the first spurt of hot cum in my mouth as the first explosion was deposited on my tongue. I felt him, first, inside, then his cock as his hands reached behind my head and pulled it upwards, causing my lips to be pulled hard enough as my jaw had to be stretched beyond belief.</p> <p>With him still pumping his cock, I was still sucking. But I felt him getting harder and bigger still. And the second spurt of cum exploded into my mouth before I could even feel its warmth. It hit the back of my throat and I felt the hot cum dripping down my chin. I did not have very much time before the third burst fell into my open mouth. I swallowed it, still sucking. I felt the cool liquid on my neck.</p> <p>He suddenly pulled away, his cock still rigid inside my throat. With the last spurt of cum, I felt his hands reach around my body and hold me up as he slid himself down and held me from the top of my thighs. As he withdrew, I felt his cock brush against my stomach. I felt the air fill my lungs again as he held me tight.</p> <p>He held himself down onto me, the tip against my tummy as he looked down at me, his eyes locked with mine. He let his face rest against the top of my neck, his fingers running through my hair. I thought I felt my whole body shake. And then he leaned down and kissed my cheek. He looked me in the eyes and kissed my mouth. I had never experienced such bliss before.</p> <p>He was still in my mouth the whole time, his body against me and pressing into me.</p> <p>We were both breathless and still for several moments, not sure what to say next. The sound of the applause filled the house. We stood there for several moments, neither able to think clearly.</p> <p>The people applauded as we both felt our cocks begin to grow again, but nothing else said anything. I felt his chest against mine, his arms holding me in tight as he kissed me again.</p> <p>Finally, we both broke away, I could feel his weight shift on me as he walked. Without words, we pulled our bodies back, his weight resting in me a minute or two later. I felt his lips on my cheek, his nose, his hair brushing against my skin as we shared the moment in a kiss long and passionate.</p> <p>And we walked to the wall, the wall that had been the base of our village, the wall that I was the only one of the three. We are the Three, the three that cannot live in this world. The Three. The Three. the two of the Three to the Three of the Three: in this world. Our Two are in each and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
