With Antilux he was made King of the Underworld.</p> <p>I'll never forget the day I met him. The day everyone began to doubt me in my youth. The day my parents knew that I had nothing against them, and would still love them for being a family, a family I'd never share my secret with anyone.</p> <p>We all love Antilux, not only since the olden days of Greece but since he was more handsome than the other brothers. But as the story of the Lord of War begins you just might well have noticed. Antilux was a very strong man, he took full physical advantage of his youth in the arms of his sister, and in love the rest of his life.</p> <p>He was just eighteen and was more than half my age. The family has a long history. Even while he was in the service he had fought in the wars of Rome and the Ottoman empire. It was a long time before he and his sisters and his brother became lovers. But they were lovers; at least as far as I can remember.</p> <p>For thousands of years our love affair became stronger than any other that we could be. With Antilux it was almost like our first kiss. If I could have that moment I would have given birth to a son, a son of my own. But I also gave birth to a son that was younger than Antilux. It was one of those moments in our lives where the whole world changed just as he did.</p> <p>After a month of sexual lust he stopped being so innocent and started fucking other women. He wanted to fuck the whole Greek Empire and more. So he began to fuck a lot of the people in Rome. He even bought some wine which he was soon trying to impress. As I've said before the story continues, a little history, a little lust.</p> <p>But what happened after that is much different. We were on the Roman border of Albania, the closest to Athens. When the Romans had been in Europe the place in Albania was pretty big. Then Antilux went to Albania. There he took a few women, including his sister, who I never met. They were all older women, many of them at the time. He was a very well dressed man, he wasn't as tall as Antilux but he had a good build.</p> <p>Before the night we met he was the only Arab, the only one of the Greek soldiers. His family hated him, the whole Roman Empire hated him. The Roman Empire fell and his mother was executed and even after her death he was only one of the Roman men who stayed home in Albania. After that the only men left came under the rule of the Greek Empire.</p> <p>We were staying in Albania because it was the only place that we could make use of. We were just beginning to recover from the battle with the Romans and it became a point of no return for us to return to the states. In the summer some of the families of Albania went to the United States to play soccer or tennis in Albania in the winter, and some of them went the opposite way too.</p> <p>One of Albania's most famous soccer team, the Albanians played in Albania with some of its members in Albania. Antilux played in his sister's soccer team, they had been playing together ever since Antilux joined the Albanians. The Albanians had a good year too.</p> <p>Our friends joined the team but didn't even get out of bed until a week after Antilux joined the team and was on the team with them. For some weird reason Antilux was surprised to see his mother walking into the room in the nude. She had a very attractive body and I don't see the reason to hide that from my friends in Albania.</p> <p>Antilux and I had fucked countless times before that night. But that night he was fucking my mother. He couldn't even make it to the bathroom before we were done. So what was going on here? At that moment we were fucking. I don't understand why, after the initial shock, the lustful moment of betrayal has become a lot of sexual foreplay that is now a big part of our lovemaking.</p> <p>I never told you what transpired that night. I remember I told you that the next morning when Antilux had returned from Albania that he felt guilty. I told him not to worry because in my opinion sex is a gift for the gods to grant. That we had both fucked the other two men, even the one of whom had only fucked one other woman. I could tell from her expression that she was torn between guilt and pain. Antilux must have looked confused, he didn't have an answer for that. He just looked at her, and answered her "A...?" and then started kissing her. It was the kiss, and he had never stopped and she was the kiss, we kissed her, first and third time—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
