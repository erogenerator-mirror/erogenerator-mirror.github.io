It stops life short. It simply depopulates. Claustration,</strong> in this case, comes in the form of an enormous amount of the life time accumulated on the planet of Menthino, even as we grow used to it. We don't mind it at all. We even enjoy it when it breaks us from the mundane.</p> <p>I was thinking what to order.</p> <p>When the door bell rang suddenly, I hurried to answer it. "I'm sorry, my love, I've been waiting," I rushed to the door.</p> <p>"I've been waiting too, my love!" said her mother, smiling, "Oh, my darling!"</p> <p>I opened the door.</p> <p>Rena, my late wife, welcomed me with a hug and a kiss on both cheeks. She was wearing a white gown, not much, but full on. Her breasts were huge, almost spilling over her upper arms, and she had no cleavage. But they were still spectacular, I loved to see that, and I was so jealous! Monasticism, that much I understood.</p> <p>We kissed.</p> <p>"Let's see the goods, my darling, have been waiting for," she said to me, smiling as she looked at me, "It's the least you could do!"</p> <p>She led me to the bedroom.</p> <p>We'd been planning this for months. My mother had been telling me more than ever about the old missionary position.</p> <p>On first our minds, one was of this: the whole day, day, night; the whole way in between, in perfect harmony; and then we'd had lots of foreplay. It's what we did for a week's pleasure, to make it last. And then it was the main course. No foreplay, no masturbation, just our love making.</p> <p>That was what they called in the old missionary- position.</p> <p>What I liked best, more the idea of penetration, that was it in perfect harmony with the intercourse. Monastic sex is much more sexual than you'd see in a modern day romance—what the fuck do they think of it in today's movies of women—and it's a much better substitute for intercourse as well as if an older guy is the one that you get inside.</p> <p>But there was one more twist to be the foreplay. In order to prepare for penetration, it would be better to prepare for fucking. And since I was the one in charge, I did the first part of the preparation. I kissed her breasts, and then kissed down to her navel.</p> <p>I felt her breasts there, and I kissed more and more, but, at once, I ran the tip of my tongue lower between her navel and the hair on her mound. And I felt my mouth closing in on her sex; she moaned and raised a little in surprise. I was really surprised; I was about two hundred percent sure that this was going to happen. I started licking, and soon she had a second orgasm, and then I started sucking and kissing on her clitoris, my fingers rubbing up and down her vagina while my face and hands rubbed her breasts (I have to say that every inch of her body was a little more sensitive than I had remembered).</p> <p>She came again when I moved down and licked and nibbled on her breasts—they were big, bigger than any girl's tits I'd seen, and I had to hold her breast in my hand to make her feel less of my touch: her nipple was getting big, erect, so I squeezed it and, almost instantaneously, it was growing even more. It was more than I had imagined. And the feeling was really wonderful. I really love them, I want to suck them, to drink them, and especially to make love to them myself: they're both good to have, but they're also just not meant to taste anything else. For instance, they're the most gorgeous thing in the world on film. I love their faces, their eyes. I love their bodies—the curves and the shapes, the shapes, the shapes—they're the perfect thing to make love to and especially enjoy.</p> <p>After that, I'd suck them all day long.</p> <p>And now, I had three of them.</p> <p>"Do you like me to lick your ass?" I told her. "I love that so much! And I'd like to do it to some time. I know that your asshole is my favorite, especially when it's being spread by such a big strong finger."</p> <p>"You're just as perverted as you are yourself, and you love to do things to me. I can't wait, my darling. But first, I want to do something to you."</p> <p>"Then I lifted her up to a chair, and, and kissed her anus, and then kissed her breasts again, and kissed, her legs. Her clitoris one mouth, and vagina.</p> <p>"Now, my tongue to—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
