The Dinner</h4><p><strong>It was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering the dining-room. Each one asked what strange influence had brought them to this house, and yet astonished, even</strong> delighted in her own presence at the moment by her own unique presence, at each one's reaction. She had just come off her own special assignment—as she always had.</p> <p>She was a beautiful girl.</p> <p>I could tell she was feeling the same way.</p> <p>A little while later, as dinner came to an end, they sat in the living room to the end of another of their long conversations about the subject of the day and life. They were the only ones in the living room. Only a couple of the ladies had anything to do with it, and they were the only ones to have anything to drink, as far as they were concerned. They were the only ones to have the house, and so the party was for them.</p> <p>"A toast to the beginning," someone said.</p> <p>"To God," someone else said.</p> <p>The two couples made their way through the house. The last thing they wanted to do was to start a fight. So, the party did not end. After a couple more rounds of glasses, a little more wine and a little more cuddling, it was time to get out of the house and to go back to bed.</p> <p>They each made their way downstairs to a side room and onto the bed.</p> <p>As before, they both laid down on the soft bed and immediately felt the excitement as the other couple made their way over to them. By now, everyone could clearly make out the sexy couple lying beside them. The girl was on her back, with her legs spread for her lover, obviously enjoying the sexual arousal she was experiencing from just lying there with her eyes closed and her fingers working in the other couple's cunts as they writhed beneath them.</p> <p>The two girls were smiling and smiling, and they were so happy to find themselves getting the stimulation they'd been working toward all the way through the evening.</p> <p>All the while, the girl on her stomach, with her legs tightly spread, one of her hands under the other girl's knee, the other hand on the hip of the other girl, the other hip thrusting upwardly, with her pelvis thrusting backward, her legs spread widely in response to the stimulation she was receiving from her partner.</p> <p>There were two very attractive women in bed, at the moment that they were the center of the most intimate act for them. And what ever was going on, they loved it. They were in the room next to them, the girl in the middle, their faces close to each other's lips where it took them a moment for themselves to meet.</p> <p>The couple on the bed had their faces right there, exchanging kisses which were as passionate as her fingering was. And then, when the boy with his head buried between her legs did not have enough energy to do more than lay there and enjoy the pleasures of her body, and then he had his tongue in the girl's pussy, feeling all of the pleasures she knew.</p> <p>Of course, they were together now, and, because of that, and because of her expert tongue, of her ability to bring them to another climax, and of the other couple, together too, and in the end it was not enough of a climax which took the girl from where she had been, either, but as if there were others, they got the same kind of intense climaxes by having her clitoris rubbed in the same way.</p> <p>It was a long night, for the girls to have sex, and they felt so good in that condition of being aroused by the others' bodies and being able to give each other a long, hard climax. This continued without fail and soon each of them felt themselves becoming totally aroused by the others' body's sensual sensuality.</p> <p>"I love every second of it," both women remarked.</p> <p>After a while they were not there very long, for the girl between the legs who had been doing it for a while now came to a conclusion.</p> <p>"Come on," she said, as if to emphasize it for them.</p> <p>Both the girls got up.</p> <p>But even then they remained near the other one.</p> <p>"We were at the wrong place," the girl said, indicating the other couple. "Don't we love the other?"</p> <p>"We do."</p> <p>"Well, just keep your head on the pillow, then."</p> <p>They did.</p> <p>The others left.</p> <p>When it was done, the next thing they did was join the other couple once again by the side of the bed. Before long, they were sitting close to each other on the bed. After that, the girls got busy for several moments. So-weev.</p> <p>and and again and again, before and all this night. the morning and the next year. After that would become two and, and them and and two and it are a long and three and many and and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
