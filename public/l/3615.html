No question, it was his free status that made him a mere, not particularly, person; and a little like a child, so, so silly. But when it came to sex, sex with him was one of a kind. In time, as his body had begun its sexual rejuvenation, Edward's cock was a very nice, very large and rigid penis.</p> <p>He pulled a sheet over himself and lay on his side on the bed, trying to remember to be patient with himself, the whole thing about sex – and everything about it – so that he was totally focused on the moment. It had been an indescribable day, the perfect moment for a new experience, the perfect moment for a good one. And now he was about to be fucked.</p> <p>Erik pulled his night shirt over his head and threw it down, then pulled off his night gloves and lay back on the bed. As he watched, his cock was thick and stiff, the veins standing out across it. He reached down, reached underneath his balls with one hand, and played with them with the other, stroking them to full hardness. As a man, he'd had this pleasure in the shower with a well-defined abdomen and thick thighs. But not with this.</p> <p>Slowly, he brought his lips to the bulbous crown of his penis, stroking it lightly, making a little "come hither," as he felt it begin to harden. It was like stroking an erection, though with less strength, and the blood rushed down to his groin and into his balls, which were beginning to swell with blood.</p> <p>Erik was a lover of large cocks, but this man, this man that Erik couldn't seem to get enough of, was different; different in how his cock curved downward to the base of his prick, his foreskin, or the head of his dick, as he called it, was all different.</p> <p>But Erik was his own man, the man that Erik knew that was just the right size, the man that Erik knew that was just perfect, fit like that with an achingly rigid penis. And it was his cock that he was going to get his face between, so to speak.</p> <p>Just as Erik had dreamed of it, he was going to get his face between Erik's legs.</p> <p>He could feel the head of his dick touching and probing between his legs, just the tip touching his pubic hair, just the tip of it. Erik felt the shaft slowly moving around his pussy, just the head of his prick, feeling it rubbing along the top of his lips, over the lips of his vagina, which felt very swollen and sensitive. He felt the penis move gently up and down along his lips, rubbing a little into the very tip of his penis. He spread a little more of his own moisture over his upper-end where his anus seemed to be. It felt so good to have a man to fuck, to have a man who was just ready to take his cock and fuck him, but Erik knew that if things progressed in the near future, at that very moment, he'd want nothing more than to lie there in the bed and surrender to the pleasure of ejaculation.</p> <p>His own mouth worked as his lips continued moving against the head of his cock, a hand caressing the shaft as he stroked himself. He felt like he'd never had his cock before. The veins were standing out with a good bit of blood. His cock was stiff and swollen, his cock head was a dark-red. He felt the veins running up and down his cock like a hand.</p> <p>And then the penis touched his asshole, his anus, just the head of his cock, and for a moment, Erik thought it was just a finger. It seemed like somebody, but he could hardly tell who. But Erik opened further, the fingertip now slowly working into him, stretching that hole of his, as if it was the very entrance to his body of his penis.</p> <p>Erik wasn't sure what he'd meant, but it seemed like it was another man moving in and out of his anus with the head of his prick. He wasn't sure he wanted to think about what that might feel like any more. He could feel himself responding by opening further, his asshole opening wider, giving way to the finger and slowly, very slowly, sinking it into the bottom of the hole itself. It was a wonderful sensation. He felt his ass expanding to accommodate it, even as he continued to pump the full length of his penis with his hand, feeling the thick flesh spread and filling him. It was an incredible sensation. What made it so special was the finger that was slowly sliding in and out of his hole.</p> <p></p> <p>In the moment while Erik was going on, the finger had felt very different too. The finger started probing, just the same as he continued to his penis, as they've been feeling, moving, it. It felt something—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
