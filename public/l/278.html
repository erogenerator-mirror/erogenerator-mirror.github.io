The Whale Watch.</h4><p><strong>The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to windward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern. These last three were brought alongside ere</strong> long ago, and the one who died was one of the ones left alive to fight. The one that we will get rid of is your fellow-virgin. She lived for this moment. This is our moment: our last chance.</p> <p>I looked out for her, and she was right in front of me once again. Her long, black hair was pulled in a ponytail like a halo down her back and her pale blue eyes shone through. Her long legs were on fire, and the muscles in her arms were tight as she was holding me in her. She gave me a kiss, slowly this time, and then she put her head back and looked into my eyes. Her lips were soft and moist, giving my heart all the love and courage it needed to die. I looked into her eyes but her eyes never left mine. She was in love, I thought.</p> <p>She was going to take me and make me hers from the very start. We parted lips but remained there, and the fire in her eyes never left her face. She closed her eyes and her head jerked, and she bit her lip again and she gave me another kiss, this time from her cheek and chin to her mouth. This one lasted longer since we had made love before, or since we first met. It was our passion, it was our love, and it was ours. My hand ran down her spine to her left thigh, and finally I gripped it gently and she did the same to me. I pushed her up from me, and she moved to sit next to me. Our lips parted; I gave her another kiss, and she smiled back. This had been our first night, and it had been the beginning of the beginning of a long and beautiful, happy year that can go on until our hearts have grown two sizes. I put my hand on her thigh and ran my fingers up to her pussy. This time she did the same and I was immediately surprised to find a wet pussy, a pussy that could be called a fuck-box. I was still holding her leg in one hand, and my other hand was in her lap. I touched her clitoris with my finger tip and she shuddered. She smiled at me again, and her mouth was still in my mouth when she reached and took my cock in her hand. I smiled back at her, and she took the top of my cock in her mouth, and started to take me all right in and out of her mouth. I ran my finger up and down her slit until I found her clit under the hood.</p> <p>Before I knew what happened, she had my entire cock in her mouth, and I felt the waves of pleasure going through it. She bobbed her head up and down slowly, going as deep as she could into my balls; after a minute or so of that, her mouth slid off, and she looked at me with a smile on her face, but her smile was different. She lowered her face and looked at me from a distance and continued to look intently at my eyes as well. "I know you're ready to start fucking," she said, and then gave me a sly grin.</p> <p>She started to stand and I took her in my arms, not letting go of her. She smiled at me again, and I kissed her. As we started to kiss again, her hands stroked my body, slowly, lovingly.</p> <p>The next step was to get between her legs and then I would fuck the shit out of her. Her legs parted like a flower open to spring, inviting me in, and I could feel how wet and slippery she was. Her pussy was still swollen and she kept her eyes closed but smiled at me with her expression that always left a trail of sex and excitement in her face. So, when I slid my entire cock into her a second time, she let out a soft sigh of pleasure. It was my first time fucking a woman and I enjoyed the experience tremendously. I started to move in and out. My penis was moving in a smooth rhythm within her, but without feeling the whole thing inside her. I was still kissing her lips, and when she started to moan, I felt her body beginning to tighten up. She was close, so I increased my pace but didn't come myself: instead, I grabbed her by her waist and held her down. But I loved her more than anything in the world and I took full control of the movement in and out of her. My penis was moving smoothly in and out of her and I could feel that the friction of the friction was building in her clitoris. She felt it too, and she whispered into my ear: "Fuck me. Fuck me now. Give my love." With me now fuck me. That's what?" Awww' me." I give' love." And fuck'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I never-fuck a fuck my darling</p> <p></p> <p>she came like I love herâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
