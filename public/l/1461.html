He fucked her.</p> <p>She had fucked her father, and she knew it. As a result, she was well on her way to doing exactly that.</p> <p>It was very early summer when they arrived home. It wasn't a very pleasant experience for her, but she enjoyed it nonetheless. She had to admit that they were all such good boys: well built, handsome and healthy, nice boys. But none of them seemed as good as Daddy. Every one of their faces seemed to come back to him as though they had been burned into their minds. He had his hair a little shorter than usual, and his tan uniform made him look as masculine as the day he had been born. He had glasses, but his eyes could tell whether he was an idiot, a dumbass, a pervert, a scumbag, or whatever.</p> <p>He had made her cry.</p> <p>She had felt good.</p> <p>She had felt sexy.</p> <p>That's when her father came to her. He was in his own little world. He was smiling like he did whenever he walked around the house alone and naked, and she loved him when he did. She enjoyed his company. She enjoyed being with him. He liked her. He liked girls who were not as beautiful as he. So many of the prettier ones, and the ones with the larger breasts, the fuller ones, and some with smaller ones with larger ones, she thought. All that was going on around the house wasn't so much him being in love with her as it was to make love to her. That was the truth, wasn't it? She did just what she was doing right in all of these things. If that's all, then she felt a little bad about not responding to her father, but she did anyway. She liked to kiss him when she was about to be fucked.</p> <p>She did what she was doing right in the kitchen - to give her father a chance to touch her breasts, and perhaps to lick her pussy if he wanted. It was so naughty for her to have to stand around while she was sucking her own husband's cock, and she wasn't about to turn that around. Her best friend wasn't her best friend for the moment. Her best friend would never do such dirty things, but she hoped she hadn't offended her father by doing it. She hoped he made her as happy as she hoped he did. She hoped he enjoyed what she was doing. She hoped he enjoyed what she was doing too. She hoped he was enjoying what she was doing. She hoped he liked what she was doing too.</p> <p>That's when her mother saw her standing there with her boyfriend - and with a smile. She quickly crossed the kitchen for cover when she saw her mother in a few seconds.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," her mother called her. "I don't know how you're doing."</p> <p>She didn't need to turn around. She quickly saw her mother's blushing face. "I'm not. It's just... I don't know how to say this. I'm not..."</p> <p>"You are?" said her mother, giving her a reassuring smile. "My son is fucking your mother! And your father is fucking mine!"</p> <p>"It's just..." she mumbled. "I'm just... it's not..." She was trying to work it out in her mind, but she knew better. She knew better than to go for it. She knew better than to go and have a hard time figuring out what to do. Maybe she'd better call her father. She thought about telling her father that she just... had sex with her boyfriend, and if that's what's wrong with her, that's what's wrong with him, and that's what's wrong with her. But... she couldn't. She had to say it. She couldn't have her boyfriend fucking her mother. All this time thinking to herself: Daddy's going to see you later and you're not going to feel good either.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she said after finally coming to herself. "I'm terrible about this. I can't help it."</p> <p>"Oh, come on. You like doing it? Come on. You like it. You like that feeling it's getting me so wet, that you want it too but know it won't happen. That you're just not going to feel good. That I shouldn't get so turned on that it does. That you shouldn't feel good." Her father turned to her.</p> <p>"Come here," his voice was firm and commanding.</p> <p>She reached out and grabbed her father's face. "Come here," his voice again was soothing. "I'll show you. Come here. Come here. My name."</p> <p></p> <p>She said. "Daddy!</p> <p>His face went. came.</p> <p>"What?<texting her fatherâ€”&lt; p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
