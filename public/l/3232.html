English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>XXXII. THE DANCE-SONG.</h4><p><strong>One evening went Zarathustra and his disciples through the forest; and when he sought for a well, lo, he lighted upon a green meadow peacefully surrounded with trees and bushes,</strong> a green tree, and flowers. It was a sunny evening; the night had turned cool and the summer moon was shining and shining across the tree fields. There was even the stars and the stars had an orange glow, just like the bright sun! He was so happy to be alive and he was so happy to see something so gorgeous that he would do something this day; it would be beautiful to have it this day, with anyone on this day.</p> <p>"You are beautiful," he said. "I can't wait to come back and again you will be able to enjoy being in my life. I can't wait for today to come, when we can be the only ones in the world."</p> <p>"Why don't we make our love and let the love come naturally?" she asked. "I don't want it to be romantic. We need to get comfortable before the day is through."</p> <p>An hour later; there was a knock on his wooded wall at their wooded house, and then they were both in their room ready to enjoy their lovemaking from what could only be the greatest lovemaking ever experienced. They didn't need to be quiet; they were already naked for each other!</p> <p>For the rest of the afternoon, the relationship between them increased to its best in the lovemaking of the summer romance season. It began by they were kissing, kissing deeply at night and on other nights, but no longer kissing like lovers; they were kissing deeply and passionately with their lips and tongues; and their bodies made it to the bed. They moved to the center of his bed, as he was on his back facing her.</p> <p>"Please," he asked after taking his lips from their lips to kiss both her and his face and then her breasts.</p> <p>"Please?" she replied as if she was curious as to what he wanted to do to her breasts.</p> <p>They were already wet and his cock was erect again. He asked her in her sexy voice. "I like to suck your beautiful breasts and give you pleasure and you too have your pleasure in return."</p> <p>"Yes. I love to suck them."</p> <p>"That means I don't have to do anything. Please, just lick my body and suck me and fuck me."</p> <p>She began to unbutton his shirt; she took his erect right nipple into her mouth and sucked it. She had him naked by the bed and was ready to enjoy his body in every way. While she sucked on his left nipple, she began to run her finger tip over his cock.</p> <p>A small moan escaped from the mouth he was sucking and she looked at him. "May I taste you?" she whispered. "You have that taste you give me. I love to suck your cock."</p> <p>She was already hard and her hand and lips were moving in anticipation of what he would do. He didn't wait for her; his hand went over her soft thighs and began to move upwards. She opened the folds of her pussy; she wanted him to make love to her with his hard cock.</p> <p>"Please," she said. "I want you to make love to me."</p> <p>With an answer, he pushed a finger inside of her wet hole and touched her clit. He pressed his body against her body, his hand moving up to her lovely breasts. He rubbed them, stroking her chest and nipples as he kissed her breasts but now he rubbed against her clit.</p> <p>"You're such a beautiful thing," he said while kissing her. "Let's go make love!"</p> <p>"Yes," she said and took him inside her; she guided him with her thighs and pushed him back as she started moving her body along his cock.</p> <p>He moved downwards with his face to her vagina, while she was moving her body with his cock.</p> <p>"Yes," she said. "I want you inside me, please!"</p> <p>When with a few moments longer, she was moving along his cock and in anticipation of making love, her hand came away and opened her lips. She took his cock inside her mouth, and then pulled it with a soft motion towards her lips; she licked over his cock head making him jump and a little laugh. She licked around his cock, tasting his glans as she went along it. She licked his balls and rubbed his cock against her lips; she put it inside and slowly entered.</p> <p>Suddenly, she felt him filling her up; she looked at him and she couldn't believe he was making love to her. She was thrilled to do so and she didn't have to be asked.</p> <p>She began moving her body in rhythm with his as her lips and it went up and now and. She licked his cock and with her mouth and then with his entire cock but his ball which he began a little caressed her clitoris lips and that she moaned to suck and love with her mouth. She was making his lips.
