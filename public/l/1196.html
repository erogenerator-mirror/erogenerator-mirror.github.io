Her chamber was narrow, neat, unobtrusive, with a long sash-window, facing the East on the back court-yard of the house. Cosette knew nothing of what</strong> lie between the walls of her chamber, of the secrets therein, of the staffs whom she'd been employed with and who might she meet outside, of the women she had sex with. In her bed, she slept the night; she did not dream: a part of her was in her chamber dreaming. The other part of her was still awaked and breathing. Cosette was in her dream.</p> <p>But her dreams, when she woke to the sight of her body; she was alone in her bed, alone and naked, and with a dream to be shared by her friends, at least that's what she said to herself, to herself - it is who I am: I am naked and free, and I know of those who can see that, who might, to have those be there." I'm on you! "Cosette, do you want to have sex with me?" I'm still on you, you slut. "No, not yet. I'm getting there. Take me, please."</p> <p>She was a virgin; she didn't even know her sexual history, or her love of sex with men in general. Sex had never included any man, and certainly not a man without a penis. As a young, virile adolescent, she had had none of these people, but with her mother, so she could be with them, in a moment, and she had a great deal of sexual experience, and a great deal of excitement. She'd been lucky to have been born with a penis, or had had a clitoris, but as the years passed, she'd have to try different different boys in a different way. Now she was twenty-three, and her body would be hers forever. And she knew it would.</p> <p>Sixty-seven: Cosette, your first time, I know it would be the last, and you're so young, and so sexy, and so perfect, and so gorgeous, and...</p> <p>For the first time in a while, Cosette felt her heart race; her nipples hardened, her hand drifted down her belly to her sex. Her vagina was wet with her juices, it's lubrication, it felt so warm, so wonderful, a lot of it. She knew exactly where it was going to be - she knew that she would do it right.</p> <p>Cosette opened the door to her room.</p> <p>There were, of course, no windows, she had to look out from the windows to see her. She got out of the bed to do that. It was a bit tricky, but not as much so as in her dream, when she went to her closet and drew out nothing to wear; it might show.</p> <p>"Cosette, come with me; be with me, as I've already prepared, and you will see the joy of the pleasure that is to pass through you. Please?"</p> <p>She went through the doorway to the window, she closed it behind her, locked it, and held it, staring at it, her heart beating a bit faster with the excitement that had gone through her.</p> <p>When had she last seen it?</p> <p>"Serene: this is where you will be?"</p> <p>She held the glass door open for him in her room, and went inside:</p> <p>He was there in her room, sitting on her bed. He was looking at her breasts. Her nipples; they were quite erect. It was strange: he had said, "Your breasts are large." Not like hers. They were, indeed, much larger than hers. They were round, but firm, and he could not wait for her to tell him that. Her breasts were full of the most exciting, sensual experience in all of her existence.</p> <p>She had, of course, not ever told him what hers looked like, but he had said, it was better than hers, "Her breasts are larger," not "She'd better look something like yours." He was still looking at her breasts. She opened her dress: she was standing in front of him with only her panties on, as if she was a goddess that had just been fucked in a moment's dream. No, that wasn't what she meant. She was in a dream, and she was ready to be fucked, she was ready to be given her orgasm, she was ready to have his cock inside one of her holes; she wanted it, she wanted to cum, she wanted to feel his cock inside her, fucking her, fucking her, fucking her. She wanted, she ached for, to be fucked by this man - this god of a man, in his turn, the goddess of hers, that who was her lover.</p> <p>Her father's hands on her breasts.</p> <p>Cosette: Cosette saw his mother's breasts</p> <p>Cosette:Cosette Cosette Cosette Cosette Cosette Cosette Cosette, look, look at him down, at the cleavage of his hands on her, cle—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
