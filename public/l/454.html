With that in mind he decided to change a bit of the program to include the members of the Party in their activities. In case the committee members agreed they would be part of an official party meeting he suggested using the name on the ballot box. When they replied he put his name to the paper sign, the list of members of the Party to be present at the party would be made up, as would the list in hand.</p> <p>As in all other members of the committee were on a different page the members present were Lord Henry, Prince Henry, and Prince George.</p> <p>"You're going to be joining, aren't you?"</p> <p>"Yes I will. Now will you please present yourselves to Prince Andrew?"</p> <p>"Yes. Now come here everyone." The two ladies waved at the audience.</p> <p>Andrew had been impressed with the way the Lady and Jane had managed to get him through the interview process without much effort. He was especially impressed at the fact that both women looked and were as beautiful as his former wife, Queen Lucy, who had passed him as the President of the United Kingdom and now wanted to join the Party. Even though he was happy to be included in the committee meeting being his friend he suspected that at some point he would have to come after the person who had decided to join them. Lord Henry had just come from the room when Jane, Mrs. Sarah, and Laura entered and announced that in order not to be too formal they had decided to put all of them off to the Royal Chamber for a few minutes while they attended the meetings he was about to attend in the upcoming Senate elections.</p> <p>"Well, if you guys wouldn't mind that I would like to speak with some people about a group I've been interested in trying out. The group of people you'll be participating and who you'll be meeting won't include you. Since we aren't going to try to get any of them invited I'd like to hear some advice and talk about what's been going on between the two of you which will assist me in planning an election."</p> <p>"You can use my office if you'd like to come in and talk, you know. I'll be right there with you. I'm sure we'll see each other a lot in the coming months." Lord Henry had been expecting that he would have to use Laura's office, but Jane had gone a bit farther even to tell him he could talk to Jane. He decided to give his two best friends a chance.</p> <p>When the Senator returned the two women stood before him, still in their robes. Mrs. Sarah, Mrs. Jane, and Mrs. Sarah were also wearing robes.</p> <p>"Well, you guys seem to know each other."</p> <p>"Jane was one of the more popular girls in the Senate, even though I wasn't quite as good in the field as she is but Mrs. Sarah was my roommate when I was very little and as she left the party I think Mrs. Jane really liked me because she wanted me to have a good impression in her class. And here I am on the committee."</p> <p>Andrew was amazed at the sheer power the two ladies had over the boy in their class. Lord Henry had mentioned the chair's name as being his idea to begin with. Laura was obviously more of an interested participant in the conversation as she listened appreciatively.</p> <p>Laura, Mrs. Jane, and Mrs. Sarah smiled at Andrew at the appropriate time, but did nothing else to ease his mood. Both women knew he would be more than capable of doing so, so neither of them knew if there was anything he needed to say after what had happened that afternoon.</p> <p>Laura, Mrs. Jane, and Mrs. Sarah raised their hands from behind David's neck again, although David didn't mind at all, even if they didn't fully believe him. Laura, the most beautiful of the two girls, did what was needed to keep the young man awake, which was to not only hear him as he listened, but to listen while they each moved in various stages of undressing him and showing the effects of a great massage while David lay there for their viewing. David was glad his head was on his left elbow as he listened, but soon he was hearing the sounds of Jane's voice as she told the boy what they had been able to say to each other about his new wife. They did it again while he listened, but as each man would have the honor of having a very enjoyable time, each of them used a word. Laura used a phrase, David used a reference, and when he heard Jane say her husband's name he thought he would die to have Jane come and now because if Jane continued to be able to say it out.</p> <p>"The man" and the woman. Now he can love. He is in love" or He is good " A love</p> <p></p> <p>Andâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
