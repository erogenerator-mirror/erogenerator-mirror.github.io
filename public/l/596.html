It had been planned that the party would be one of the few events for him that was not a private occasion for him by the time he reached Moscow. That was not what had happened. It had been planned this way. It hadn't been planned to be an ordinary, ordinary party by a man he had actually met on a previous occasion. It was planned to be something much more than this. And it was his party and his life were in danger of turning upside down. That was certainly all that had happened on that night. After all, there were millions of people, including all those people with whom he was married and his wife. The parties just kept inching closer. At that moment, the fact that these events could be ruined by a man having sex with someone else without his wife's blessing was something all the more frightening.</p> <p>It was the first time that he realized how deeply he was taking up a wife. He had met all the women in his field. There was nothing that he had never considered, in fact, before when he had met many of the women in his field. It was not the fact that he had spent so much time with all those women, except that one of them was a friend of his wife's in his country, who had been a friend of his wife's in the same country. Or even more, it was his wife who had invited him but of whom he did not know. He had thought of this because he was hoping that she would be in the wrong position to seduce a man by seductively going down on him and not rejecting him for his gender. He had thought of how much this event would mean and how much it would make him so much more attracted to women, who gave themselves too easily to men in order to have sex. Now it was clear to do this thing as an effort by him to avoid this particular event. The only possibility was his wife, the woman who had so willingly sucked his cock, and not some others and he, the man who had so clearly had the desire to have sex with her. Of course the last thing he had feared would happen was her being in the wrong position to seduce a man, especially one of his colleagues. That was to have sex with someone who looked like him. That was why he had tried to avoid this event, after all, there was no turning back. But now, he wondered whether this thing could be his opportunity to avoid it by having sex with someone other than his wife.</p> <p>He was certain now that he could avoid it by having sex with someone that he loved, who had had sex with her the same way and was so much more attractive to him than any one of the men who had fucked him in a long while. The fact that he wanted to have sex with one of the women he had just met was also a possibility. But it was not the time to contemplate this as any more than an opportunity to have sex with a man one of his colleagues. It was not the time to think of this as an opportunity to have sex with a woman while not having a wife, that was what mattered now. There was no time to analyze the situation. There was no time for a discussion, now. This was not an opportunity for her to have sex with a man. It was an opportunity for him to have sex with a woman who looked like her, that was why he had thought of this as an opportunity.</p> <p>As he began to think of it, it occurred to him that, at this moment, both the opportunity and the danger was not at stake but rather his wife. They were supposed to have their fun with men. She needed a man, now that the opportunity had come. He hoped now that he had the opportunity to have sex with her as much as she wanted. He already understood that she would make it very nice for them both to fuck someone else without his knowledge or permission and he would help her by letting her suck him. That would be the chance and the risk of losing everything. He still had some questions but he knew now that one of the reasons he had decided to go with Kutúzov was that it would be risky to have sex with someone as beautiful as his wife. He had seen Kutúzov often with women in his field with whom he had sex. He had seen some of them. He had seen many of them. This opportunity that he had had made an important one for all the women in his field who had seduced him. And for he and his wife who were so willing to put themselves out, to fuck any man that they wanted, for a few weeks that would be a very long time. He wanted them so badly.</p> <p></p> <p>On the one hand, a feeling of being in a moment when he was not sure that this moment, but on the chances were right he had become to know the answer, the situation, after two of that he felt it was what—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
