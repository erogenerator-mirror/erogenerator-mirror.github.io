English by Fyodor Dostoyevsky </h3><h4>CHAPTER I</h4><p><strong>“Can this be still a dream?” Raskolnikov thought once more. He looked carefully and suspiciously at the unexpected visitor. “Svidrigaïlov! What nonsense! It can’t be!” he said at last aloud</strong> to his guest.</p> <p>“Let me buy that for you,” replied Daryalla.</p> <p>“Yeah, we’re rich! I want to fuck you!” Raskolnikov said enthusiastically. As always, his speech had become a lot more confident. “Please, come with me! I want to fuck you. Let me.”</p> <p>Daryalla did not understand this man’s words; surely he would find a way to get even with her so he could go to her with his beautiful cock now! It would be the most exciting and exciting fuck she’d ever had in her long life! This man was a true romantic!</p> <p>“Can we”, interrupted Daryalla. “Let’s go into the bar.”</p> <p>“What the fuck?” asked Raskolnikov, alarmed.</p> <p>“Let me see!” Daryalla said, moving the small table aside. She got up and removed the coveralls, revealing that she was in fact naked as well. She removed the hoodie and the black bra that she was wearing and held them up as if to say.</p> <p>“Oh no! Please! Please, please! I’m dying to suck you!”</p> <p>“You want me to suck you?” Daryalla asked eagerly.</p> <p>“Ohhh, God! Yes! Yes! Yes! Please, please, can we, I want you to!” Raskolnikov was begging her. It would be impossible for him to do anything else—she wasn’t even naked. “Please! Yes! S-SVIDI SERIOUFICA!” she repeated, holding the hoodie to keep it up. “I-I want to suck-suck your cock! Please! S-SVIDI SERIOUFICA!”</p> <p>“Let’s go to the back room!” Raskolnikov told her. He had never been far enough from a bar to even open a second door. He thought it was because the rooms were too small to get into them. “Let me see!”</p> <p>And they did, with Raskolnikov helping make the door even more narrow. The entire floor was still lit with the streetlights he lit earlier as they had already opened the door. It was almost like a dream come true; but the reality was anything else!</p> <p>Raskolnikov had a long-necked, deep-red, tux, with the top tied tightly in a bow. It was an expensive item, but it was the perfect complement to her long, gorgeous, slender frame. He was a very handsome man, as all the girls had said.</p> <p>Raskolnikov wore a white, sleeveless, black, long-sleeved shirt underneath a black silk gown that was completely cut off. At the bottom, he wore black pantaloons that were made of leather and fit tightly to the shapely lines of her long beautiful legs. The whole ensemble was of very thin material and had thin elastic straps that she held tightly around it.</p> <p>Daryalla and Vereza, her friend, had stripped off their clothes in one hurried move, and were now standing naked before Svidriga.</p> <p>“Raskolnikov!” Raskolnikov said, smiling broadly. “I’m glad you’re there. It will mean a lot to me! I love the feel of you, dear.”</p> <p>“I love you, Vereza,” Daryalla said.</p> <p>“I love Raskolnikov! How could you not?”</p> <p>“He’s beautiful?”</p> <p>“Yes, he is,” Daryalla replied.</p> <p>“Now, let’s see why you were such a good sport.”</p> <p>Raskolnikov took a long, luxurious drag on the cigarette and blew the smoke through his full lips. Raskolnikov also took a long drag and blew it again. When he exhaled, his lips were shiny and moist. It was the most erotic aroma that Raskolnikov had ever felt—and the smell of sex! He felt that his skin must be very wet—it must be an ocean!</p> <p>Daryalla and Vereza came back and pulled on a chair next to the one of the barst mirrors. They had a very large, wide-backed seats. They had long necks.</p> <p>Raskolnik and big neck was the window was the small counter-barbers on the same bar—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
