She had passed a very bad night; her cough was frightful; her fever had doubled in intensity; she had had dreams: in the</strong> last few hours a very bad dream. And the worst nightmare she had ever had.</p> <p>She pulled herself out of bed and staggered up the stairs in to the bathroom and turned on the water, flushed the toilet, and entered the shower, then sat next to him at the edge of the tub, under the hot water. He turned off the water then took off his clothes, taking off his bathrobe to make himself presentable again. She climbed in after taking off the wet clothes and they embraced, her hand on his cock.</p> <p>He turned her around into a kneeling position, turned the shower off then kissed his way down her neck, over her shoulder, then the front of her breasts, lingering there, kissing around the nipple and down, then down, kissing her belly button and down. On his return journey, her knees felt weak.</p> <p>He pulled up her right foot to place it on the back of her knees, then moved back to her left, then up her calves as he slowly moved upwards. He placed her knees on the wall above her, then spread wide apart.</p> <p>She felt something cold being rubbed on her pussy and a finger in it, then moving around her clit before slipping inside. She loved it. His finger continued touching her pussy while his head dove under her stomach to her abdomen, licking her navel, and then going back to her pussy.</p> <p>He moved up onto her, and pushed her back against the shower wall. He moved one hand around her hip to cup her breast, while kissing down her back until he reached the base of her pony tail, then began to rub her back with his other hand to finish the job. He had a good idea of the effect he had on this woman because she arched her body in a gesture of bliss. It made sense to him, of course. But he was still going to fuck this girl so he wanted her to know she belonged to him.</p> <p>He slid one hand out of her hair so that it would keep it in place, and slid his other hand between her legs. He found her clitoris with his fingers and began to gently stroke it while he kissed her shoulder, down her chest. Now down he went, trailing his upper and lower body back up to her neck for that special place where her skin felt all that smooth and soapy slippery skin. That spot she loved to be touched with. The place where she had given him so much pleasure.</p> <p>He took her clit into his mouth and was sucking on it, moving his hands out and up, while his mouth was working her clit at the same, faster pace. His fingers found their way to her pussy, but now he was working two fingers into her, so he would be able to massage all her juices off his fingers while he sucked on her clit.</p> <p>He slid back down to her stomach before kissing her breasts, and slowly licking from her neck to her nipples, while gently stroking both hands and fingers deep inside of her pussy. He loved how good her nipples felt in his hands, and his tongue moved out, teasing her with it, until she felt it touch her anus. He felt it there briefly at first, then started to rub her fingers in and out of his mouth, while his other hand slowly massaged her clit.</p> <p>Then he placed his thumb under her clit so that one finger could push in and out of her pussy. It felt so good. How wonderful it felt to have his finger in there.</p> <p>Just as he was getting back to the task of pleasuring her, he stopped, pushed up hard against her pelvis and then lifted her off the ground and carried her to the bedroom while she was still laying out on the bed. On the bed he placed her down on her back. She smiled, remembering some of the fun she had with him when he was a kid, and she had been willing enough for him to go for it.</p> <p>He moved in on top of her. He moved his cock in to her pussy from above while he lifted the one leg of hers up to hook it on the bed, and he started rubbing her pussy with his finger while he slid his finger in and out of her. It felt wonderful to be able to do that, even if it was wrong.</p> <p>But she didn't want to do anything wrong. She felt the pleasure of him rubbing her pussy with his cock until it was throbbing and ready to cum. And then he slipped his cock into her.</p> <p>Not hard, but it was a nice feeling for a while. His cock moved in and out just inside her pussy, making her insides feel wet. He was so happy to be with her, and it felt so good.</p> <p>she felt herself cumming again. It seemed like that time to say 'Oh man she was a woman is woman, he feels a man that is a woman.</p> <p></p> <p>and it's a woman feels a thing because—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
