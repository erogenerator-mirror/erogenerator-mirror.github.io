If he have sinned, his is the harm, not mine. But perchance he</h4><p><strong>hath not.</strong></p> <p>We should fuck and be fucked, for God's sake, just because you're a woman? Just because we're so fucking and no man is just an idiot who can't think clearly? Is that it? If I am an idiot and if there is anything to do at this point in time then fucking and fucking is what it is. I'm fucking you so hard that you'll have to beg me to fuck me all I want to do is get off on my own? I'm fucking you because I want to be inside you. I'm fucking you because I'm not all alone and I'm fucking you after a night of fun. I am fucking you because you belong to me and because I'm going to have my way with you. "Don't be scared, sweetheart, I'm not going to force penetration. I promise all this will be good, honey. I promise I'm not going to force anything. If you still want me when you're finally ready to stop fighting me, then we are going to start to make love. We're going to make love. I promise. Just remember, it's my first time making love to a woman so don't worry about hurting her, okay?"</p> <p>"I don't want this to be a rush." "I want to be with you, Rebecca. I want to be inside you. Trust me that, it will be a long and incredible night." "Thanks for sharing me with you." "Anytime." "I love you," ******</p> <p>It took me over a minute to walk through the door. Once I hit it, it was like an eternity passed before Rebecca spoke it her beautiful deep brown eyes stared into mine. "The first thing I think about when I wake up is when you're inside me. When you're inside me, just be with me, sweetheart. That's why I came with you. Because when we finally get done making love, I can be with you."</p> <p>"I won't be too happy, Rebecca. I don't know if anyone could be happy with you the way you have me and I'm not about to stop being content with that." "There's no other man who can make you happy," she cooed, and then she kissed me. "Do you know what I mean by that?" I asked, as our lips parted for just a moment.</p> <p>"No, I got a good idea. Are you going to make me horny?" "Of course not. If you wanted to, you could have me right this instant," she grinned, and then she got up and hugged me. "I'm glad our first night together is finally gonna start," she said and then she kissed me again, and then we kissed each other softly. "I swear you can't feel me anywhere else, sweetheart," she said as she kissed me again. "I love you," she said and then she was gone. When she came back into the living room, Rebecca was sitting on the couch just watching some television show on television. She had a sexy, slightly crooked smile on her face, and as she looked at me, she said, "I haven't seen you in so long. You've been through something rough in the last year, but you looked fabulous all of the time we were together, so don't feel left out."</p> <p>"You looked fantastic, sweetheart," I said, and then I smiled at her once more. "I love seeing you smile so much."</p> <p>I could see she was enjoying this. It took me another hour to walk down the hall wearing only a towel.</p> <p>"Rebecca?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah?" she replied, looking up at me for a moment.</p> <p>"Rebecca, I can see why you came back," I said, and then we wrapped our arms around each other as we kissed once more.</p> <p>"I can't be happy with you," her voice quivered as our kiss ended and the kiss ended and the kiss ended once again.</p> <p>The moment we stopped kissing, we stood there with just a couple of inches between us. I don't think either of us had been kissed in that long of a time in our lives.</p> <p>"I love you," she said and we looked at each other once more.</p> <p>"I love you, Rebecca," I said, and then we kissed once again.</p> <p>When we finally broke the kiss, I saw nothing but love on her face. This was perfect.</p> <p>******</p> <p>I walked along the streets of Downtown, trying to figure out the next direction. I could see that it was hard.</p> <p>We didn't even leave the room.</p> <p></p> <p>We weren't even</p> <p>We didn't even</p> <p>we didn't even</p> <p>were not even</p> <p>really wanted to go</p> <p>again</p> <p>to go</p> <p>go againâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
