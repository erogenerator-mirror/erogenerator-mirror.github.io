In matter of writing or reading thou must needs be taught before</h4><p><strong>thou can do either: much more in matter of life. ’For thou art born a mere slave, to thy senses and brutish affections;’ destitute without teaching of all true knowledge</strong> and true values. A man should be at home and ready for anything. And here I am a young man. I am ready to satisfy all those desires.' He moved his hands over my back and waist, rubbing, pulling, caressing all over as he knelt. He massaged my butt and legs, moving his thighs up over my hips, spreading them apart like a little dancer. He kissed his way up and down my thighs, kissing my belly button and I sighed my approval.</p> <p>He massaged my breasts, kissing, licking, sucking, and nibbling his way around and into each of my nipples on the left, my right, and my left nipple. He pulled one nipple into his mouth, sucked it hard, and then flicked it with his tongue. He rolled it between his teeth and teeth, and the nipple hardened and stood tall. He leaned forward and sucked it into his mouth while he sucked on my left breast, the breast he'd sucked earlier for the night, and then rolled the nipple between his teeth, bit the nipple then rolled it with his thumb. He alternated, biting my other nipple and sucking my right breast. Each of his fingers were like a snake's, moving all over me. He squeezed my ass cheeks and pulled them apart while he flicked my nipples with his tongue. He sucked them all the way from my perineum to my pussy, lashing them. He massaged my thighs, my stomach, ass, and then my penis, which was growing with my excitement and desire.</p> <p>I put my hands on his shoulders and pulled him down to me. I was on all fours again, and I wanted to feel him inside of me again and again, like his finger. He slid himself into me and we began to move together. I couldn't help but moan when he pushed as far as he could, his thick cock sliding inside of me. I could feel every ridge and vein of his cock inside of me, feel every throbbing vein and pulse of him as he moved inside of me again and again. That first slow thrust had me on fire with excitement and pleasure. I was on fire, too, as I held on to his shoulders and began to rock my hips against him. I needed him. I was on every limb of my body, every sensation, every stroke. His cock felt so good. His arms were strong and he was so thick. I was aching to push him inside. I wanted him inside me. I needed me between my legs. I needed him so very bad.</p> <p>He knew what I need, and he moved, pulled, and pushed in and out several times, every stroke feeling amazing. The only sounds were the wet slapping and slap. The slapping continued with occasional moans, and my hips pushed harder up, harder, and harder against him as he thrust in and out of me again and again. I was ready. He knew. I pushed into him, wanting to give himself all I had to give. I wanted him to fuck me, his full length inside of me. I wanted my orgasm to come at the same time as mine as he fucked me. I needed him to feel what a good, deep, strong, hard cock was for me. I wanted him to feel the fullness and the fullness of me inside of him. I wanted him, and he now knew.</p> <p>I pushed back at him. He obliged. He fucked me. I told myself to let him. Fuck him, fuck his cock, let him slide his thick cock deeper into my ass, let him fuck my ass, let him feel the tightness, the pressure, the pressure of my wet pussy, wanting him deep inside of me. He fucked me even harder, his balls slapping my clit, slapping my balls with each thrust, and I knew he was close. He was pulling me back into him, feeling every inch of his cock moving inside my ass. He pushed in. His whole cock deep inside of my ass. I was in ecstasy. I wanted to feel as much of him inside of me as I could. He felt so good. The fullness, the fullness of him now inside of me. So filling inside. His thickness in both our bodies. His long, hard shaft inside of me.</p> <p>I wanted him to cum inside of me. He felt it too. He grabbed my waist and pulled me away from his body and then thrusting me back into him, again and again he pushed himself into me, hard, and I couldn't do enough. I grabbed his shoulders and pulled him back into me. All I wanted was for this to be as good as it could be. He thrust in and out, deeper, more and harder, and I could feel him inside of me. And knew I could still feel him. My cock inside of him, I could keep him, inside of him, that way inside of him where and he could feel each one of him, his entire body as the—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
