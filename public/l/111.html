THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR</h4><p><strong>The Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals</strong>, especially after a period of non-traditional romance, have become topics at parties of all sorts. Especially the most scandalous: the rise of the Pope.</p> <p>Of course, there is another class of interest. It comes in various shades and degrees.</p> <p>There are many aspects of a woman's beauty. To be precise, the most prominent is her eyes. When her eyelids are closed, that's a sign of intimacy and intimacy.</p> <p>But there is another part of her body. This has many aspects. It is very sensuous and sensitive -- even erotic. Her breasts are large. They fill and bounce -- and defy the laws of physics in the universe. The nipples (or maybe the most important aspect -- when erect) are an enticing dark shade.</p> <p>The breasts are a feature that always fascinates me. They can be described by their size, their firm shape, and their texture. They are an irresistible combination, and I have tried to emulate them with my every move.</p> <p>So what do I do when a woman approaches me, and says: "Can I suck on a man's cock?"</p> <p>To this, it is like the first time I saw a woman in a swimsuit. She is wearing her usual white swimsuit. I can only guess what is underneath. Her breasts (or perhaps they are small) are large enough that it is difficult to tell. But not so much with her nipples jutting out. They are beautiful soft mounds.</p> <p>Her vagina is smooth, open, and very small. It, too, is not that small.</p> <p>Her clitoris (Or perhaps it's already there) has a prominent shape. It is an enticing shade of pale pink. As a result of her natural state, it is an exciting and arousing sight.</p> <p>She is obviously a woman who enjoys pleasuring herself. She is a natural woman, who enjoys making love with a man. I don't know that I'd be able to do anything else.</p> <p>Now this may sound odd. Here, let me introduce a woman I'm curious with. What she is, her name is Aya, and she's a virgin. I have had no experience of her having her first intercourse (though later I came across pictures of her masturbating) with a man.</p> <p>Aya is a slender woman with fair skin, medium length brown hair, and dark eyes. Her breasts are small, but they don't sag a bit more than a handful (not even a handful in her day).</p> <p>Her vagina is tight, with a small pink tip. It is a beautiful combination.</p> <p>She has a small ass, but, again, it is as an aesthetic feature. It is soft, but firm. It reminds me of a banana pod.</p> <p>Her hips are slim to the point where they are less than a handful. She has a small round clitoris. I can only guess that it is what I would call a clit.</p> <p>At the moment, with one or more fingers, she is rubbing her clitoris vigorously.</p> <p>"Can I taste a pussy?" she asks me. If a woman asks me to, I'll tell her, "Yes," or "No." But even with her asking, I'll tell her "Yes." She'll want me to.</p> <p>If we are going to play out a game of sexual persuasion, and ask a girl to give me vaginal sex, I'd rather ask her to suck on my man's cock.</p> <p>Here, my first time with a naked woman, it's been an experience that I will always remember. There has never been an age where I've thought of myself as a pervert. It's only when I'm in a serious relationship, and I'm not averse to spending time with one naked woman or another. But now, with Aya on her knees with a stranger's erection in her mouth, there is someone else in another room, in another way.</p> <p>It hasn't been so bad. I've had intercourse with countless other women. They've all been virgins. I've had a couple of lesbian relationships, but there's never been any real emotional connection between two heterosexuals. Now I can do the things I would have done when I was younger, when I am in love.</p> <p>There is one more thing. I have many different ways of expressing my feelings for a woman, in a sexual setting. I suppose this has to do with the fact that I cannot imagine Aya getting anything done behind closed doors. Now I know it is also a way to describe Aya.</p> <p>She's in her late-30s, and looks like her mother. Aya's mother has a dark complexion. Not nearly black, but very dark. And I've often saw a mole. I've had been with dark features similar. Aya has an accent, but, but no, but dark and a brown hair, and darkâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
