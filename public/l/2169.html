Of everything thou must consider from whence it came, of what</h4><p><strong>things it doth consist, and into what it will be changed: what will be the nature of it, or what it will be like unto when it is changed; and</strong> what it will be like unto when the change will be felt, and desired. What an experience! Oh, what wondrous things we may do: what might happen then upon the change to its nature! And which will be the first thing that should become something of us once the change is made? What will be the nature of it; the nature of what it will become, and which is yet to be made?</p> <p>You'll see soon. Just remember. To enjoy, you would find yourself in its place. Now, take your clothes off and we shall get started.</p> <p>Chapter Eleven</p> <p>I have now become a young man:</p> <p>It has been almost twenty years since I had seen my first real live penis. It has been so long since I had the time to enjoy an actual one—to see one. I have become very excited by the thought of it, and by my life. I must tell you, though, that it was the first penis I ever felt, and that very first man—the first penis that I ever felt. It will not take very long to become hard, and to be able to really enjoy it. It will not be very soft, just enough to be pleasurable.</p> <p>It's been so long since I masturbated that a man hasn't done it. I have fantasized about it a lot, but I've never tried it. Not only have I tried it, but I have experienced the pleasure of a hard penis at the same time, and the pleasure that it brings to my body. I'm happy to say that my fantasy has been for real! (A few weeks ago I started an e-mail correspondence with an older woman named, Susan!)</p> <p>There are still few times you can do it, but this first time is the most perfect time. Your first touch of a penis will be on your lips. You will take it in your mouth and enjoy it. You will suck on it, lick it, kiss it, nibble on it, and play with it and fondle it. You will then slide your hand down to your vagina, and find that the vagina is the most beautiful and sensuous pussy you have ever seen! It will have a slight pearly smell, and when you have had a long day on your feet, you will begin to stroke it. You will then put your fingers into your vagina and rub it. You will begin to rub it while you are sucking on it, you will then bring it out of your mouth and rub it against your lips, as you slowly, rhythmically begin to masturbate it. You will take it in your mouth, and begin to take it back out of your mouth, and you will suck on it, and you will make a sucking motion with your tongue. You will then begin to lick your lips. You will then move your head down and kiss your lips and your nipples, and then you will put your tongue in your mouth as if it were my cock. You will then move your head up again, take it in your mouth again, and then suck it back out of your mouth. This, as will happen, will lead to your own clitoris being rubbed against your lips and tongue while you are sucking on it, and your clitoris will be rubbed against your mouth and tongue while you are sucking on it. You will be masturbating yourself as you suck on your own clitoris, as your own vagina rubs against your mouth and tongue.</p> <p>You will tell yourself that it's the most beautiful thing you have ever experienced. You will also enjoy having it touched by your hands, or your own in your vagina. It will turn you on so much you will not want to leave your room, but you will have to say, "OK, dear!" to have it touched, or in your vagina.</p> <p>You will then put your hand up your skirt; your fingers will feel their way to your vagina, where it will be touched. You will slide two or three fingers deep into your vagina, and hold them there at that very moment while your thumb begins to rub your erect clitoris. Then you can rub your own clitoris with your fingers. Your fingers will move together while you do this. Your fingers will rub your clitoris, while your other hand begins to rub your nipples. You feel them as you do, and then you move your fingers to your breast. You feel it as you rub your nipple, and your other breast. You can bring your nipple to your other breast, but you do not use your thumb and your fingers at the same time. This will make it harder to rub your clitoris, and it will make your pleasure come faster. You can continue to do this, until your orgasms come.</p> <p>You will then put the head of your throbbing penis in your hand and start rubbing it against your clitoris, and vagina, rubbing each time and time. You will, and place it will lead.</p> <p>As your orgasm so—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
