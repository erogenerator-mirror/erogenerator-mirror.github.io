Knitting</h4><p><strong>There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. As early as six o’clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried</strong> my naked body. I was still in the habit of wearing trousers around women—my cock was now very stiff. My breasts—my big round globes of soft flesh—cheekies had developed, their hardness rising in their undersized brassieres, my nipples were fully erect. I'd done this before without making any commitments and without any real effort. Slight fear had been instilled in me, and I made no effort to wear pants around women.</p> <p>My nipples, if you remember to ask, and the rest of my body, are always erect—a sign that I'm still a woman's sex.</p> <p>My pubic hair is fine hair of coarse brown. I often kept it trimmed, to hide the sparse red coloration of my bush. But, with me, the hair was a darker brown, with a very faint gray on its sides. I'm afraid it may become transparent—I can't stand the heat—but my cunt is smooth and soft. The only thing that is different is that it stays bare and that my hair looks as soft as sandpaper and that its texture is like sandpaper.</p> <p>My nipples, as they are all important: there is no question about my state of arousal. That doesn't mean I don't have a penis that could satisfy me, but that the physical world might be more important.</p> <p>Now I'm aware that many of the ladies wear shirts, shirts that are almost transparent when unfastened. When they're wearing shirts that are unfastened, even with the sleeves rolled up, they're transparent. They're also more difficult to contain and, I realize, if they have panties on, they're probably pretty transparent, and in fact are much more difficult to unbutton at a moment's notice. The shirt is a white, silk shirt that is usually buttoned in the front, but is usually tied in the back. The bra (my old, worn-in bra) is white and I have a pair not unlike the red ones that have become fashionable. The shirts that are in my hands are, I do believe, very pretty and very comfortable—even when worn by a woman, I'm not sure which pair the person holding.</p> <p>I'd left the window blind fully open, when my hand was just in front of the buttoned front of my white shirt, when my nipple was just inside the edge of the open shirt. By that time my nipples were fully erect, and I was holding my breath, my arms to my side. It was just a tiny bit like I was standing at the door to the car, looking into space, and I was thinking about my nipples and the sensation of my hard nipple—about how it would feel if I just squeezed it real tight and ran my thumb over my nipple. If my right hand was out of my left hand, I would be holding my left tit—maybe even my right—or maybe my left nipple—if I was standing there looking at a crowd—not that my nipple would be any more visible in this position.</p> <p>If my right hand was out of the window, I was holding both my hand and my nipple. I was holding a very hard nipple in my left hand. My right hand had its left hand on the seat of the old car, but my nipples were still hard. I could think of nothing other than the feel of it.</p> <p>My right hand was holding the button of the shirt. All the way it was just outside my reach. My left hand held the shirt open. My left hand was inside the shirt. I could feel no fabric in the shirt. I could make out the outline of the shape of my nipples and the texture of my left tit. Even with my left hand on my nipple, I could feel the texture of my nipple through the shirt. It felt soft and smooth and the texture of fine, thin fabric against my hard nipple.</p> <p>This is why I'd pulled my shirt so tight. When I was standing a full twenty-five feet in front of the window, my nipples could do a very fine job of poking out of my shirt. They could show even through the shirt. A small movement of my hips would reveal more of my skin and my tits in the shirt.</p> <p>As I held my left hand out in front of mine in the car, I had a clear view of my hand and nipples going from left to right. I could feel the light friction of tissue inside.</p> <p>It was time to start to dress.</p> <p>I opened the car door and walked over to the door with my right hand inside the shirt. While I had to climb high to get my jeans on, I did my right hip and arm, leaving the left to hang in the shirt open fly leg, like my right.</p> <p></p> <p>As I opened the door and I could see the dark, I saw that my left my nipples were clearly. Buttons were the material covering my left nipple. and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
