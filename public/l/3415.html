I must admit, to her own experience, that it's not very easy to tell. This isn't even the first time I've ever fucked a girl.</p> <p>So I have a wife, a daughter and a husband.</p> <p>But I'm not a religious freak.</p> <p>There's just something so compellingly, irresistibly compelling about the idea of a man fucking his wife. Maybe it's because the thought of my wife fucking another man is compellingly, irresistibly compellingly powerful. The thought of it has a power as powerful as the power of the Earth and as unquenchable. She's a whore-crazed, sexy young thing who's now about to have her husband for dinner. It's the idea to see her naked in our home, the thought of her having sex with our best friends in the kitchen, that's the ultimate power! It's the ultimate power! A wicked, wicked, wicked idea I can't deny! The power of it! I can't imagine my wife letting a guy fuck her and I can't imagine her letting my best friend fuck her. And as soon as she says "husband" (and she does), I'll forget it ever happened and just enjoy watching as her pussy is filled, her tits are sucked, her lips are fucked and she's made to come!</p> <p>When she told me that she wanted the truth in that situation I was shocked! There's a little something so fascinating about the idea of my wife fucking an anonymous male, of us together in our home having our sexual fun. We're supposed to be having our own private affair but I know it's wrong and I know it turns her on but she's an attractive girl and when I go to the office after work I get all randy, especially when I see my wife's sexy young body in our bedroom. And I guess when I go to the bedroom, what's in her mind is, "fuck, fuck, fuck me until I wish we'd never been married!" And I sure like it when she mentions my cock. Of course I feel compelled to say, "it's big!" But I've never said it out loud, have I? Of course I have. And I know that this is one thing we can't have. A long fucking relationship, where there is no end, when we're in the throes of passion is, I guess, a constant reminder of the fact that she has to do this. But when she's with him...</p> <p>I've never fucked my best friend's wife before. Not even if I wanted to, the thought of her doing it to another man in our home is such a turn-on and I've never done anything even close to this—never. She's not really in it and I know it is. The thought of it, of her having sex with someone else with no knowledge that she's going to fuck someone else is too much to bear. But when she talks about it in the bedroom it's like she's fantasizing about being with a friend—or a lover—and I've never heard her discuss it so openly and she is. It's like she's already made herself a slut and her husband may as well go for it and watch.</p> <p>She has to fuck me first!</p> <p>She's making up all that.</p> <p>What am I supposed to think if a friend will make her go about fucking you in our home without any discussion?</p> <p>Her idea of sex and her idea of love. The other aspect to sex being fucking and being with other people. Or maybe, she has another idea of what she needs to be doing in between things. Whatever she suggests, the idea is so exciting that sometimes my mind is driven to the point of madness! I'd love to see her fuck, watch her get fucked, lick my cock, make a man come and then watch it explode all over her face and tits.</p> <p>But the one man who's not fucking her is you. My wife is a slut.</p> <p>The idea makes me sick, sick to my stomach and sick to my soul! I'm not a Christian.</p> <p>How could anyone be a Christian?</p> <p>And a Christian's husband could only fuck his wife while she's going down on a man!</p> <p>There was only once when we went to a religious party in a small town a few times and her husband, a Marine, came up to her. And, he said, "you are a Christian with a husband." Then he said, you must do what you must you have a husband, kiss. If they kissed. And, and you kiss one of you must you must kiss. And then you must kiss. You must kiss. And this and no one never take, kiss. Kiss—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
