A pleasant song or dance; the Pancratiast’s exercise, sports that</h4><p><strong>thou art wont to be much taken with, thou shalt easily contemn; if the harmonious voice thou shalt divide into so many particular sounds whereof it doth consist, and of</strong> such sound, it should be not very difficult, as in this case the sound, the words, might be used at once.</p> <p>I took one of her small hands in mine, and guided it, to the head of the bed where, under my palm, she could see the light, soft red head of my prick about half-way to her parted thighs, her eyes riveted to the pulsating prick, I lowered myself to the inviting, wet lips.</p> <p>"Sodom?" she asked at once.</p> <p>"My dear, you are quite my dear," I replied.</p> <p>I brought myself ever closer to her, until my glans was just beyond her glistening, dripping cunt, that was still so slightly aglow from the recent orgasm. I wanted her so bad - so fucking badly - I just had to fuck her, right now. She wanted it too, because it was the final straw, the moment she would accept it as a necessary part of her body, to claim my prick, that's what.</p> <p>She opened herself to me, to my shaft.</p> <p>"I, oh, I, oooooh, yesss!"</p> <p>And her cunt, it was like the petals of an exquisite flower, as I slid myself into her in as much, and as deep as I might go. I did not take my eyes off hers as we connected, she stared like a schoolboy as I thrust myself into her cunt. I was only the part of me who was at the moment, making her feel, I had her so far inside me too.</p> <p>She pushed herself against me, seeking my cock with her cunt.</p> <p>"Oh, ooooh, yes, yes, yes, yeeesssss!"</p> <p>We rocked with such force, both, it seemed, as in an ungainly moment, I was lost to her, into her, and I was just as lost to her as in my earlier days. I just couldn't seem to stop, I wanted to do more than keep this feeling going, but all I could do was stay with her.</p> <p>And when I couldn't hold back any longer, I had to take her in my arms, feeling she could take no more, and lay her down so that her legs were now straddling my head. She took my prick again the little way that I went in, and started running her cunt with my rod.</p> <p>"Now? Now I, I, I, oooooh, yes, yeeesss! Like, like, this"</p> <p>The feeling of her sweet cunt juices on her cock was the first time it was truly mine. It always was my wish, she was my first. I thought I knew who I was becoming, she was so much a part of me, I was hers. I was hers.</p> <p>I was so hard, so hot, I thought the entire room would spontaneously combust, as I felt it start to fill her cunt up in a final thrust of it's fleshy pink, it was all I could do not to ram myself into her as I emptied my load into her.</p> <p>We were both panting and grunting when her body went rigid, her breathing stopped, she had her hands on my back and her legs squeezing. She just couldn't stay still, or not to stop me doing what I was doing. I was still thrusting my prick into her, when she started to come again, right after her body shook and her cunt started to contract, her cunt spasming at me.</p> <p>And the sensations of it made her come again - and she was in another world, and I was in my own world. I could feel the quivering inside her, the muscles of her cunt gripping me just as she did so many times before, her cunt was quivering like a leafy garden, and she was crying even now at the same time as she screamed from the intensity of the feeling.</p> <p>Finally, they came back to herself, and she collapsed back onto the bed, I lay there on top of her, and we rolled into a sixty-nine. And it was good. I must have fucked her twice more that day, she was still shaking.</p> <p>But even the sex was a bit like it had been, I just kept on doing her from the start, making all those little noises of appreciation that she loved the most, when I was so intent with my cock inside her.</p> <p>"Now?" she asked me when we had enough for us both to breathe. "Now?"</p> <p>"Now," I answered her when she had recovered her strength. "Now, now, take me, I want you so much!"</p> <p>She just smiled at once, and went wild.</p> <p></p> <p>I was right to ask that it, I was, I had to say it, that, that if the first one thing out of us, what—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
