On the thirteenth of June the</strong> Emperor took her back to the capital, took off all of her clothing and laid her on their bed. He fucked her senseless, then they slept in each other’s arms.</p> <p>Danka found herself on a day bed with her legs spread, her pussy exposed, and her nipples swollen. She thought of her husband, of their children, of any possibility that she could become a citizen in a year, of a few more years. She was happy to have his seed in her belly. She thought of all the men at the wedding, of all the women on the wedding bed. None of those thoughts crossed her mind. He was handsome to her. She was beautiful. She thought of him often. She even thought of his parents and what they were going to do about her. She thought of his mother, that would be her world. She thought of each man, no one at all was better for her than a man and she wondered if her love could really be equal. So many thoughts were running through her mind but she was in no hurry. She knew of his family and so she played it off.</p> <p>When Danka woke in the morning she was not alone. She saw the face of someone much younger than she and the face of her husband. It was her son and a look of amazement crossed her face. ‘Good morning,’ she said, ‘to have so much news from the army?’ He kissed her forehead then leaned in and planted his lips on her lips. His hand caressed her cheek, she put her arms around him and kissed him back. She thought of how different it was to her with her husband. It was like no other sexual experience. Danka turned her son to her and held him. The kiss took her breath away. Their faces were close and she could feel the hardness of his cock through the layers of clothes.</p> <p>She rolled him onto his back and lifted his cock to her waiting lassitude.</p> <p>Danka opened her mouth and began to lick the end of her son’s cock. She started with her tongue down the length of it. She licked the underside of the shaft, then circled the tip of it. She ran her tongue around it, then sucked the head between her lips for a few seconds. His cock twitched as she touched it. She moved it between her breasts and brought the cock to her nipples. The cock, her son, was inside her, she had him. The thought crossed her mind that it was her son who had made it possible for this union. A wave of pleasure ran from her breasts down the body. She rubbed her tits together to get her nipples against her sons’ cock. She rubbed them together, circling them, then sucking the knob at the end.</p> <p>‘Fuck me,’ she moaned, ‘fuck me.’</p> <p>Her son pushed her away as he lay beside her. “Not now,” he said. He reached for the bedside cabinet and found the jar of lubricant they used to lubricate their union. He applied the lube to his cock and rubbed some into it. He pushed a leg between hers. He rubbed the lips of her pussy, sliding his finger between them. She leaned back, spreading her legs, her son slid up her body, pressing his shaft against her belly.</p> <p>“Fuck my pussy now,” she said softly.</p> <p>He positioned himself between her legs and pressed the head of his cock between her lips. He slid it down the center of her vagina. Her lips held him tighter than he had expected but she was wet and ready. Danka began to rock her hips up as his cock head moved around inside her. She felt his knob press against the end of her labia, it felt good. It slid further inside, further into her and felt good. He pressed more urgently with it and her hips started to go up to meet him.</p> <p>Danka’s orgasm began welling inside her. Her son had come inside her, she felt the warmth of it spread through her body. She loved the feeling. ‘Fuck me like you mean it,’ she said. He thrust down into her.</p> <p>Her son lifted her hips higher. He felt her warmth as he slid more fully inside her. It slid down him and around his shaft. Danka held her arms and pulled herself up to meet his thrusts. He drove harder, faster, deeper into her.</p> <p>“Danka!” she called, “I'm coming, oh baby!” Her body shook as though it were riding another orgasm. She cried aloud, her orgasm coming apart from this wave of joy and her son, in her love and joy. Danka, the one person, the source of love and desire. His cock and love, the source and pleasure. The feeling and pleasure.</p> <p>Aunt,the—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
