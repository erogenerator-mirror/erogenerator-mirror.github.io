There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief</strong>. I didn't hear them approach the graves, but I heard them. All that was said were several words and one word. One word in a loud and raspy murmur at the mouth of an ancient mouth. "We go now, Marley, in the name of our ancestors." I didn't need to look to know that there would be no more. I should have taken another walk or worse, but I wanted to stay close to her. I was afraid; I wanted to see her. I wanted to listen to her. I didn't just want to take her to my house and do her a favor, I wanted to touch her. Now all I wanted to do was be with her.</p> <p>*****â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
