I cupped her left breast with my right hand, my left arm about her waist, my right hand moving to caress the other breast with the thumb and forefingers of my left hand. She reached over and pulled the bra away, freeing her small but perky breasts. Taking advantage of their luscious mounds, I bent my head and pressed on her lips, pressing our tongues together and moving my left fingers under her bra to press her nipples and to caress both of her breasts.</p> <p>She kissed and bit my skin like an impatient lover. I kissed and bit the exposed flesh of her chest, occasionally giving her nipple an affectionate squeeze and a pinch. My mouth left her breasts and moved down, stopping a few inches lower, my mouth on her crotch, kissing her as I took her other leg and began to stroke it with my right hand. She placed my lips on her bare pussy, and she groaned as she felt my tongue on her clit, spreading her legs apart, exposing a damp wet pussy.</p> <p>When Pétya pulled up her shirt and bra to reveal her soft skinned breasts and pink nipples to me; I found her pussy, and found her clitoris, and found it and touched it, moving my fingers along it, rubbing it, pressing it in circles.</p> <p>“Oh! Oh, my god, oh, god, oh!”she moaned while gripping my hair, and I felt her body trembling uncontrollably, shaking uncontrollably, from an orgasm.</p> <p>“It didn’t take long, for you to give me an orgasm,” I whispered in her ear, still lying on her, both of us naked and kissing, feeling the heat of the other bodies on, touching, kissing.</p> <p>“No, I don’t,” she breathed, “not for any time,” she whispered back as her nipples tingled, and we continued. We became lovers, like animals in a copulating jungle, we became animals.</p> <p>My lips found her navel, which I kissed, slowly, as we had the night before, and I moved down the curve of her belly, kissing, licking, and probing inside where her waist lay, and under her navel, to the top of her thighs, where her knees remained open, parted, with her legs slightly parted…</p> <p>A sound came from under her, a sound of her moaning. “Mmm, yes!” she exclaimed as I licked her vagina, licking, touching, and sucking on the soft, pink lips, until her body quivered.</p> <p>I had tasted her pussy lips and clitoris earlier, when I had licked and sucked her pussy. This time they were already moist, ready, wet, and inviting. I spread her legs wider apart, and found that she was already wet enough. I leaned forward and put my finger on her clitoris, holding it for a few seconds, then took it in my mouth and began to kiss and lick it, flicking my tongue around it, before putting the other one in front of it, too, and licking it. I looked at her, looking at her in all her beauty, and took in the sight of her lovely breasts and pink nipples, the hard, brown nipples, and the soft pink skin above them. She had lovely smooth, tan skin, with thick, brown pubic hair, and I found that my finger was making it’s way towards her asshole, until my finger touched and parted it, which I had just made, making her shiver…</p> <p>“What is it, what is it?” she asked, looking into my eyes, her eyes wide. I didn’t answer. I looked at her, watching her face, observing her face as I’d seen many times before, watching the expression, which she was showing. I wondered about the feelings I had felt, as I watched her face and her body, watching her reaction to the feeling she was experiencing, the emotions she was enjoying…</p> <p>I raised my hand to the place where her wet, inviting vagina and her clitoris were, and I could feel the wetness flowing on my finger. I put my finger, and then my tongue on her wet pussy lips, which were now wetter than they were, and slid it slowly across her clitoris, and her lips… Then, with two fingers, down from her anus, slowly… I took her clit again, and my tongue, her…</p> <p></p> <p>… and now she was my ’s it her clitoris… I said, my own lips…—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
