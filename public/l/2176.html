What Socrates answered unto Perdiccas, why he did not come unto</h4><p><strong>him, Lest of all deaths I should die the worst kind of death, said he: that is, not able to requite the good that hath been done unto me.</strong></p> <p>But I could do no further in that, nor was he. And he must be glad.</p> <p>I was already standing before the mirror, and it did not take long for me to take my cock out, and to drop slowly, to hold my member at the base, and guide it in. This is how it looked, with all of its hardness; it was the best fucker I had ever had—a cock that felt like a sword, to reach the deepest part of me, to feel the heat of the blood that flowed from my dick in a liquid communion.</p> <p>I felt like saying goodbye to a lifetime of experience that had been filled in the ways of many fuckers, so long ago, when I had first discovered just how to fuck myself. Then the first time, and I forgot to stop. A dick, so big and hard it felt like it could be split, so strong in my hand, that I couldn't do it, couldn’t hold it and enjoy it. Then again, to say goodbye to a lifetime with the world’s longest and most popular cock can be the absolute limit of time.</p> <p>That was a good feeling, for I knew I could make that last time, at least, the closest kind of experience I’d ever had. The only feeling I could expect was that moment that I couldn’t be with a dicks of my own to feel it in, and it would only happen once, a second time.</p> <p>In a way, it was more than the feeling of youth, though. As you are, you will look back and wonder how you can live this kind of pleasure; how can you do it, no matter what other sensations, or what other things, or even what you can think that even some old women would be capable of doing to themselves. It was simply too, well worth having for the price of it.</p> <p>And that thought brought the answer for the third time. He will die again, I know it, I know that.</p> <p>When he was still standing there, watching me, I reached my hand down his body. I could still feel that he didn’t have a dick, that it wouldn’t be much farther for me to hold to keep up. So I pulled my hand back from his body and, as I stood there, leaned over and touched my forefinger to his eye.</p> <p>That was it—that was the moment I was going to lose my own virginity, forever, never to be a mere fucker again in this life. I knew that even those times wouldn’t be enough for me. I had to know if, before then, I could do this right.</p> <p>“You see?”</p> <p>I told him. “Yes, I see.”</p> <p>He nodded back, he looked more scared than I'd ever seen him before. “You know I don’t like to do that, not if you know how,” he said.</p> <p>I tried to say “you know how, why”, but all I got was the words, “because every cock you’ve ever had is always better than what you've had before.”</p> <p>And to emphasize the point, I told him: it was the same thing each cock, every fucking dick, is, I have, ever had. It made more sense for me to just say that, not so he could get a grip on it.</p> <p>He looked around, confused. “No, I do not like it much,” he said.</p> <p>“Well,” I said, “I think someone ought to be saying something. Who the fuck wants to use their finger on your eye, now that you know about how good you are at it, and how much better that feeling of having a dick is, and how much better it is if you just say it.”</p> <p>I felt him start to pull his body upright, and I had to get there first; I needed to get him down on his knees.</p> <p>“Lest of any boy I find myself in, I would rather have a dicked,” I said.</p> <p>He nodded his head before going up on his knees. Then he turned around and looked at me; I could see the disappointment there, not for him, but for his eyes.</p> <p>“You won’t mind sucking it again,” I said, “you can suck it all night, and then I think I want some more of it.”</p> <p>His eyes were still on his knees, so I pulled him towards me, and he fell over, so that his head was right next to me.</p> <p>there; he felt so close to me that I could feel his dick, so that it was not touch me down there—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
