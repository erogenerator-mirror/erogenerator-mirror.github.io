HE ENCOUNTERS ON THE ROAD A STRANGE SORT OF YOUNG GENTLEMAN</h4><p><strong>Oliver reached the stile at which the by-path terminated; and once more gained the high-road. It was eight o’clock now. Though he was nearly five miles away from the town,</strong> a new wave of traffic was on its way as he approached the area.</p> <p>"I want to have a shower," she proclaimed as she walked across the field toward a large, empty house.</p> <p>He felt his groin throb, as he had when she was in that same shower less than fifteen minutes after he arrived. His body trembled ever so slightly as he imagined her beautiful body in the shower, washing her hair and washing it. She made certain he got a great view of her body from head to toe, as she worked her luscious body up so he could fuck her mouth and cunt with his tongue. They would both be so happy that night and in the future, she would be his wife, but instead of his cock and balls, he would be wearing another condom.</p> <p>He was thinking of her once again, as she finished bathing her body. Her body was radiant in the bright sun as she moved through the water. Her skin glistened in the light as she stepped closer to the water. He imagined kissing her wet body, kissing her breasts, rubbing her clitoris, before his cock entered her pussy; he would fill her again.</p> <p>After his shower he was standing by the water nozzle. He held his cock in his fist and pumped it while thinking of her body, as she bathed. As she moved over to him, he imagined taking her from behind, sliding his dick up her moist pussy, and cumming in her. She would be his and he would be hers. He would be hers tonight, and not wanting to wait any longer, he wanted to fuck her, too. He had to get her before nine so he could go home.</p> <p>*</p> <p>They kissed under the water, while they washed each other. As soon as he was finished in the shower, Oliver reached into the bathroom cabinet for her shampoo and lathering up. They kissed passionately under the water as he took her to his bed, where he lay down while she washed him. She took his cock into her hands.</p> <p>"Is it alright that I let you do that without soaping me?" she inquired.</p> <p>"Yes," he answered.</p> <p>"It's so erotic," she said, as she began to run her hands along his member. "I mean, if it makes you happy, then I'm happy to do it," she said as she squeezed his hardness through his shorts. His cock was a monster and throbbed as she rubbed its full length. He reached for her breasts, while she continued fondling his cock.</p> <p>"Oh yes, feel me, touch my body," she commanded. She was feeling her body move through sensations she didn't even know existed. She never imagined a woman could feel so erotic and pleasurable, as she reached the bottom of the hot water, before she turned him on his side and kissed his mouth deeply and passionately. Then she kissed her way down his body, as his penis sprang to life in a most satisfactory way. He ran his hand through her beautiful, black hair while his hips pumped against his palm. As they kissed he massaged her scalp with his fingers, as she stroked his shaft in and out of her wet, hair-covered fist.</p> <p>"Ooooooh, I don't know what you say about hair, but there isn't any," she said while kissing and licking her way down his body. "I was afraid to tell you about my hair since you were always afraid that it would creep you out." They were on their sides with her face, his cock, and hands on his body, while she licked and gently sucked his balls.</p> <p>This was what her body craved, so she didn't have to pretend anything about it anymore. Soon he was ready to cum in her mouth, but not to ejaculate into her welcoming mouth; but to ejaculate in her hand with his cock in her cunt instead. She would not let him.</p> <p>They broke off from kissing long enough to kiss each other's lips, and then she turned his body over and laid on top of him, while she massaged his cock in her pussy, as the water cascaded on their bodies. She moaned as they kissed like lovers possessed.</p> <p>"I love the feel of your wet body," she said as she kissed his lips again. "It's so beautiful in the sunlight. Your skin is so sensitive. I hope no one else touched me there."</p> <p>"It felt okay, no one else."</p> <p>"I knew you would never do that," she told him. "I love you."</p> <p>"I love you too," he replied her to which made him.</p> <p>"now we need to be alone for a lot," she asked," she asked.</p> <p></p> <p>They had had to me," to be together," they decided," to come together—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
