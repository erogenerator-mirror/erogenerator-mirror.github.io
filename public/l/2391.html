OF IMAGINATION</h4><p><strong>That when a thing lies still, unlesse somewhat els stirre it, it will lye still for ever, is a truth that no man doubts of. But that when a thing</strong> lies, that's for sure, we've all got the answers."</p> <p>"I don't see any real reason why you should stop with your bullshit."</p> <p>"Well I can't have that. We have a lot of catching up to do. The first and greatest step is to get rid of this hang-up about that thing."</p> <p>"That's the point of all of that."</p> <p>So we did just how we did, it will take you about two years and a lot of persuasion. I can't say this, but it will take you another two years. I don't care.</p> <p>"But you're right, I am. I'm an idiot. But that old saying is there can be something different about a nineteen-years-old when that old saying still applies. I think you deserve this."</p> <p>"Oh I know, but can you go on like you're not even forty-five."</p> <p>"I know that old saying is bullshit, but do you really think I'm twenty-five and what will the world know? I can't be too careful. I've never had sex with a guy before in my entire life."</p> <p>"You got to call me David," I was surprised at how calm and confident we were as we continued talking. There's no one else who does things like that, it's just them.</p> <p>"Yeah well. I get a lot of shit about myself."</p> <p>"Well it's good to hear that. Is there anything else you need?"</p> <p>"Not right now. Listen, when I say I need a little time to myself. But I do need to think. I don't have much time but there is a lot of time and I need a little time. It's the first thing I can think of at the moment. Can you please just call me David? I've got to leave tomorrow."</p> <p>"Of course, darling."</p> <p>"Thank you. I'll be your assistant for a while yet and it's only as good a time as any."</p> <p>"But I have to know," I continued, "you're a great boss."</p> <p>"Yes I am. This is something I have been trying to build, what do you think? Are you sure you don't want to go back to being a young secretary?"</p> <p>"I'm sure that's what the boss wants."</p> <p>"You might want to think about that when you have sex."</p> <p>"I know," was my reply.</p> <p>She continued talking.</p> <p>"Do you believe in destiny or destiny? There's nothing worse than being a little ambitious when your boss comes over and asks you to marry him."</p> <p>"So your boss is your dad?"</p> <p>"No, no he hasn't. He's a real estate salesman. He's not happy with his job." "I'm sure," I said, "he's a little disappointed though." I added, "but at least I'm going to live the moment."</p> <p>"I can't do that."</p> <p>"But you can do it."</p> <p>"What are you asking?"</p> <p>"Just so long as I can fuck you after we settle our differences. I'm assuming that's okay?"</p> <p>"Don't do that! What about your father?"</p> <p>"He won't ask anything of me. What do you think?"</p> <p>"Don't talk like that."</p> <p>"If he does anything, then I think I've got to let you know."</p> <p>"Of course it is." What I really meant was that my first job, now that I could finally see my father's future, would be a lot more than a job to me if I was going to wait to be in a relationship with a guy I'd only just met a couple of hours earlier.</p> <p>"But what about you? Have you got the time and the place?"</p> <p>"I'm not sure, not until I know more, but I can call you right now and ask about your meeting, you know how that goes. Are you going to go and visit him?"</p> <p>"I'm sure that's what he wants."</p> <p>"Can you do us both a small favour and call him up and let's arrange a place, you know how it goes, and we'll come by the office in an hour when he'll tell you."</p> <p>"Sounds fine. That's all I can ask."</p> <p>"Well don't bother about it, we'll come by on our way."</p> <p>"Thanks. But I might have to call him sometime then, after all, it's important that you know that I'm not going to marry him."</p> <p>"No, no," she said I, "We'll be busy with a job but that will let's what you know, not even if I'm going to see." She says what I should keep you after don'tâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
