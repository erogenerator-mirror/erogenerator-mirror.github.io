A long time fantasy: having my dream woman come home to be her lover forever.</p> <p>As I woke up, realizing that she was sitting on one of those fluffy chairs in front of me and the room had now become my bedroom, my morning erect cock started growing hard at the sheer erotic implications that were possible. I also noticed she was staring at me sleepily. The first thing that I noticed was that it was indeed happening. I felt my hard cock pressing against my briefs and instinctively undid them, freeing my swelling member. I started taking it in my hand as I gazed out the window. It was the first time I had really looked out the window since that very same morning when I had finally come home from the airport and found her sitting there; looking into the room, holding hands with her husband. From somewhere in the morning I heard her husband start singing Happy to you and we went on like that. By the end of morning it was a beautiful symphony of words; she gave him the most passionate orgasm of his life and we stayed with ourselves.</p> <p>I took advantage of the rest of the dream to reach down and start masturbating myself but couldn't. I wanted to give my wife a great day at the museum, but couldn't. I was so disappointed to find her not there in all that day. Then I saw her standing in front of the fireplace, a huge glass of red wine was in her hand and it took me a moment to figure out that she had been drinking it. I felt bad about that, but was relieved when my wife returned to the room to find me in the dream. I saw her holding up a champagne glass, it was a very pretty sight, although I probably made more than half of it since she was still wearing just a towel.</p> <p>"Good morning darling." She said.</p> <p>"Good morning beautiful." I replied.</p> <p>"Let me get you a glass, it's still chilly in here." She was standing up with a tray next to the fireplace looking down at an old photograph of a very handsome guy standing on a pedestal. He was standing beside her.</p> <p>"I really enjoy this, don't you? " I replied back.</p> <p>"I have heard about you, it's okay. I told you this is my favorite place to fuck my husband."</p> <p>"I love it when you're the one who is in charge. And I love it when you have the guy on top of you."</p> <p>With these words, she took a long sip of her glass and moved down to the center of the bed, kneeling on all fours with her back to me. I could swear a little part of the bed frame was creaking. While she was still on all fours she put some oil down her body and started rubbing her tits, pinching her nipples...</p> <p>When she brought her left hand down to rub the towel over my cock I thought she would stop, so I quickly stood up and started rubbing my hands through her hair as she was rubbing her tits in anticipation of the impending morning invasion</p> <p>"Mmm, that feels nice honey, let me taste some of your pre-cum." She said.</p> <p>Without saying a word, I started to pull the towel off; the moment of love really only went so far.</p> <p>My wife leaned forward, putting her tits in my face. I could feel the heat coming from between her legs. I couldn't help but reach out for her. After a while, we embraced and kissed deeply, our tongues exploring each other's mouths. My right hand traced the outline of her body as we explored together, touching her everywhere at once, stroking her skin, caressing her everywhere and especially her boobs, which were now exposed due to the towel that she had still on. I started lightly pushing the towel aside as the bed started to move. I was soon back at attention and my wife started to rub me with long, slow strokes along my shaft. It felt so good. I put one hand on her ass while the other hand trailed over her tummy to her tits and my cock brushed against hers as our passion built.</p> <p>"I can't wait to be in top form. But before I take off my towel", she said as she removed the towel from around her waist and I could see her breasts. They looked incredible without an encumbrance, if I hadn't seen a good rack, if I wasn't dreaming, they would be on display on any beach, in any of the shops, on any of the hotels.</p> <p>"I am not on a beach." I said shyly. I hoped she wouldn't take offence.</p> <p>"Oh don't be shy honey. Sit down and we'll show me" she smiled. "It will be easier that way if you don't lie down next to me."</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>She was now completely nakedâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
