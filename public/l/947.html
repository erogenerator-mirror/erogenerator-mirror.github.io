These mail-wagons were two-wheeled cabriolets, upholstered</strong> at the wheels, with a motorized motor of two wheels, to allow them to travel at a rapid rate.</p> <p>I had no trouble in arranging the transportation. I had an hour ahead of my time to spend with the girls, and the girls were all waiting impatiently like any other servant. It had taken only thirty minutes of running this morning, but I had the whole thing on sight within fifteen. There was still a lot to do before my departure.</p> <p>I could feel my stomach tighten as I entered the city. It was only after an hour of running around the palace, I had an idea. I stopped off at the entrance of each palace, and waited. The girls and the women from M. and M. were still waiting to enter the palace. I entered a passageway and entered what appeared to be a room. The door opened and the girls came in. There was a light, and a desk behind a long table covered with a desk cloth. There was a large table with a lamp on it. There was a glass coffee table in the room, but the chair was too big. There were three wooden chairs piled high with cushions. I assumed this was the palace's central throne room, and it had a brass throne. Several cushions were draped with the long red silk blankets. Several more chairs were arranged in a circle around a central area. There were some more tables and pillows. I had no idea that there were many people present.</p> <p>They sat at the table with some drinks and the other girls and I sat on the cushions. The ladies were not the least bit surprised, and I guessed they would do what we had come for. I sat opposite them on one of the tables with the cushions and pillows and poured a glass of red wine.</p> <p>We sipped and chatted as the girls chatted and drank wine. I thought that it looked as if it was a ritual and they might enjoy it. One of them touched my leg, and I opened my legs to show her I was excited to see her. She touched me under my kameez and I lifted my knees to give her access.</p> <p>"You know, that's the main difference between the two of you," she said. She was looking at me intently. "Do you enjoy it?"</p> <p>"It's all right," I replied. "We are here, in our own little palace. Nothing we do has to be illegal. Anything we want to do is legal."</p> <p>She raised her glass and made a toast. She raised it to the head of the table and put her glass down on the end. She opened up the top of her kameez and removed her panties, leaving her completely nude.</p> <p>"Come let us do it," she said.</p> <p>The girls got up and stood beside the chairs. They put glasses in front of me and poured me some red wine. One of the ladies had her kameez open and her bare knees touched on mine. She pushed her leg in the air. I had only to put my knee up to keep my kameez opened. The girls got a glass of white wine and got on my knees to take each glass. They pushed on my knees till I got my wine. Suddenly I felt warm wine against my cheek.</p> <p>This was the first time I had a glass of wine, but it felt like the first time we were to be the guests of a grand gathering. Now we were only three. We were the ones who made the evening, with everyone.</p> <p>The girls raised glasses again. The alcohol was having an effect.</p> <p>"Can I have another glass of wine?" said the woman who I had seen only a few hours before.</p> <p>She nodded. The wine was relaxing to say the least.</p> <p>"No thanks," I replied. "Drink up."</p> <p>She handed me a glass and I took it and set it down with a loud swallow.</p> <p>"Aye" said the woman. "Drink up, before you get any better."</p> <p>I took a sip of the wine and handed it back.</p> <p>"You must know that I am a good actress," she said. "I am the actress of the event here. I can do a lot of things. I might as well learn something on stage."</p> <p>"You will be performing tonight," said my hostess "and you will be our entertainment."</p> <p>As I looked at her she waved back to me as she raised her glass to my lips. I did not understand the gesture. I was the girl who had been standing at the table. Now she was sitting a few feet from me.</p> <p>"You will be playing some time, when, you would like this, later," she said her in a musical voice. "in you are not a part performers, in our entertainment, they are to a entertainment on you will be.
