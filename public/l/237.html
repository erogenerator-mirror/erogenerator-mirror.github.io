The Battering-Ram.</h4><p><strong>Ere quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale’s head, I would have you, as a sensible physiologist, simply—particularly remark its front aspect, in all its compacted collectedness. I would have</strong> you. It was my intention, my only real intention, to have you. I love your clitoris, as much as I love your sex. I have always loved your vagina, and I would adore fucking your cunt to a climax. I would love fucking your mouth to have you. And, as a practical matter, I would like to do a number of other things, too. In the course of this discussion, I want to fuck your mouth and your arse. And, as part of their anal intercourse, I want to cum over your pussy, in the way that I came over your mouth. And, then, perhaps, I want to fuck your arse, and my sperm spills over both of them. I will take part in all this, if it pleases you, and if you still want to come with me."</p> <p>"What do you mean, darling? What happens when you come? How does a woman’s arsehole work?"</p> <p>"I would have you if I said, ‘yes,' and if you wanted to. You have to say no, too. I have thought about it before, and I have never had such an idea. That's the problem. I mean, just because you don’t want to, it gives you that rush that you seem to crave, but only one thing is possible. If you want, what does that give you? Is that it? It doesn't matter to you. I mean, let's face it, that’s none of your business. No, there are others. Your cunt. Your arsehole. You’re all one in our relationship. How else would a woman want to be made love to? Just by being made love to. Do you really want to be made love to? Have you really wanted to? But how the hell would that work when I can offer you no other option? That’s what I’ve done with you since we’ve had our little ‘fuck-party’. What will you say if I take that last bit of goody-goody in my mouth and use my finger on your anus? Do you really want to be made love to?"</p> <p>"Yes, darling, I do. And, I really want and don’t I, want all of this? Oh, no, I want all of it. All of it. I want to feel the pleasure of your semen. That’s all of it. All of it. I have wanted for so long to have you inside me. All of your cum coming from me. It’s a big surprise. To see it. It is a big pleasure. It’s the most exquisite pleasure. Oh, darling."</p> <p>Doris smiled. What in hell was that supposed to mean? What were these words. Doris had a lot of experience with women, she and Paul. Who had ever told her that her partner was so much sexier than she was?</p> <p>Oh, no, Doris, I’ve told you I have no choice. If you have had any doubts about my ability to be the lover you want, you know what I mean. And, yes, your vagina is a big surprise. Do you really think, when you came over my mouth, that I can please your clitoris to the point of orgasm? You’ve let me in your anus, as you had me in that one time with Mavis. But, I really haven’t told you how great the thrill of the anal, the fullness in both your holes, is. I have shown you the pleasure you can give it and feel, the satisfaction that you can give and the pain. What will you like? You know it makes you feel good. Will it be pleasurable or painful. Will it be exciting? Oh, no, nothing painful. I'm sure, it will be a wonderful, delightful experience. Will you tell me if or when your clitoris responds to the pain that will surely be a shock. We are just talking a bit of pain, aren’t we, Mrs Thompson, but surely it will be more pleasurable than any real pain, perhaps even a great pleasure. I want you to know, Doris, that I want and have absolutely nothing of any consequence to it, but I know you think you must be a bit of a slut inside. I, on the other hand, think I can, if the right circumstances, a bit, a bit, of pleasure. It is just that I think I will try to be the best teacher I can."</p> <p>"You, darling, have such a lovely cock. I want that to hold it, stroke it, caress it, and make you feel it. I can play with my nipples all your cunt and even your clitty."</p> <p>Doris. And she was my cock: she said to herself—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
