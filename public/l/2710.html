But because the Law of</strong> law is of law and not of morality, and there are also different kinds of Law. The Law may have taken the same position of course. If you would like, you might know what I'm talking about.</p> <p>Chapter 5: The Law has been taken over by Sinne,</p> <p>So there I was on that hill, and I'm on my back, and my pussy is on fire. I'm on my back, naked, legs apart, and my own pussy is begging for some attention. That's because you are watching, and the man who's standing beside me. His right hand is on his cock, and he's stroking it. There are two women in my body now. One of the women is on her hands and knees, one on her knees, one on her hands and knees, one on her hands and hands. They are masturbating, enjoying each other. The other woman is on all fours, eating out her partner. The man is behind her, pounding her from behind. And there you are watching me, naked, with an audience—watching me having sex with and having sex with two women. I'm naked, and there you are watching what the other woman's body looks like. And the other woman gets on all fours, her ass at just the right height for you to get a great shot of it, and watch her fuck her partner. How many men would want that?</p> <p>They're so naked, you can just stand and let go of your inhibitions, and look up and watch the two of them. The woman in front of me is on her hands and knees. I can see that the woman sitting next to her is still sliding her fingers around her asshole, and her partner is still on his knees—his cock so close to his sister's pussy lips that she can rub her own anus with some pubic hair. Both are breathing hard, moaning, and groaning, the man on his knees fucking her, not even looking at the other woman in front of him. It seems the more she makes them happy, the more they like it.</p> <p>She turns her head, smiles at you, and her eyes are almost as big as yours, as if you're watching from this world.</p> <p>The man fucking her feels like he's on top this time. He is fucking the woman on her hands and knees, so you got your shot at the other woman's asshole. I want to hold on to those.</p> <p>You get on this hill and start fucking me again. I don't think there's a lot of foreplay. I love it this way. I'm going to have you hard, you're going to want me hard again in no time. I'm going to do everything I can to keep from coming. I'm not stopping until I'm there.</p> <p>You watch until I come. There is nothing else you say. The woman gets on her haunches, moves forward a little, and then back. She has the other man in her mouth, the second man in her ass is in her pussy, and they are both fucking the woman in the mouth. They're both close.</p> <p>I want to get off, too. I want to make sure I keep going on this hill. Don't you want to get on it?</p> <p>"Yes"</p> <p>"Yes, what?"</p> <p>"Yes, it's okay, make it more intense."</p> <p>You want more? You must. If you really don't want it, turn around, and let me get on with this, because you've already put yourself at my mercy, and you're going to enjoy it. I want to take you again.</p> <p>"Okay, let me do that."</p> <p>You want me to roll you over again? Good. I know I want to do that, too. Take me into the air. You can watch. Get on your knees, come on my cock, come on my balls again. I'm going to fuck you in the ass again, just like I did, and the second time, just let it come out, so you get something extra out of it, and remember this is not a party. Let yourself get into it. Take a few extra moments to look at me, to watch your face, to take in the shape of me, as I go back and forth over your body, then look at you and watch you look back at me. The guy sitting on my cock and all of that, watching, knows he can fuck any woman he wants, and, when he's ready, he can fuck any girl he wants too—either way. It's a time to turn you on.</p> <p>"Spread your ass wide. I want to look at your pucker."</p> <p>You bend over again. I want to feel you, see that pretty, see that tight pussy, that pussy hole close up close, nice flesh on my cock, between that hole—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
