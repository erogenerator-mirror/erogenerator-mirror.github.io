We all know its been taught in a classroom at least. For example, a teacher on her first day who told me "I've always wanted to screw the brains of the dead." "I'm no fucking genius," the teacher said after her third year of studying for her next class," you know me, but then again, I never believed there was such a thing as genius and what more might a man like a woman say to such a thing as this. She then started describing it as her first day in her class and she told me.</p> <p>"It's the only way a man can fuck a woman."</p> <p>"I've heard that before. Are you serious? She'll never be satisfied, can't even keep going until you have your heart broken or broken you are, and then you'll be nothing more than a broken man, so to keep going, you will become a broken man in just one single fuck!"</p> <p>That was the way, the way, was her way of explaining this in her first two years of research in literature. After my second or third and fourth years in college, I never could keep up with any of the male students, so here she was with me fucking another woman on my first day of my research project. Now I'm more than half way there and I'm going to fuck this pretty lady to the top. She was in her late forties and she was still so young that I could not have held out if my life depended on it. At the beginning of her first semester, my mind was playing tricks to me and she knew this. To avoid my guilt, after her third year as an undergraduate, she began teaching me all of her first steps in the first week of study.</p> <p>"Do you really believe the power is held in a man, by a women? Have any of you ever, ever, thought about making this a sexual relationship, with other women being the only ones?" My heart fell as I heard from her, she said as a woman, if you really believed then. "I'm the teacher, not you!"</p> <p>"No. No, I don't know about it" was my reply, but still with a bit of panic in my heart, " I think about it every day and I've been in a situation where I never even dreamed of being without a man or a woman in my life. And then my mind starts to run as to what's just happened to me, with or without a man. I think about it all the time and I really do hope she's not some wild, freaky girl just fucking around on me, which is very likely."</p> <p>"Do you really believe in the power of sex for us?" my heart felt as if it had turned into mush, "I really don't, I know, believe in it, but I'm not really looking at it as anything else. I just think it's an awesome fact and for the people we research there is no way in hell we can be the only ones with it. In my past, I had been fucking a lot of women before, but only a couple. The first time I had a sex class after the first semester with one of my professors. When class was over, I sat on my sofa and had been totally engrossed in my research work, so I was sitting there in the back to the back listening to my music, while I was on my knees between two women who were fucking their brains out. I just sat there for two or three minutes after class ended and just looked into the windows to see if anyone had moved. After about the fifth or sixth time of my second class to look there in the back window, I could see them fucking with each other's eyes. After the fourth time of those two orgasms I was standing there in a corner, like a statue and my mind was blown out of my head and I looked up and down the street and saw them standing there with big smiles on their faces. I felt like the shit was going to hit the proverbial fan, but I had to do this.</p> <p>I couldn't wait much longer now and I was totally exhausted. I was getting no better after my fourth year. It was time to do one last assignment for me before I left. By that time, I had two more assignments to be done, and that time, my mind and body were almost totally focused on my first three assignments.</p> <p>"When I first started doing what I started doing after that first day of research, I read about that first time for the first time and I wanted to be on top of that woman on her second day in her class. I got really hot and horny at that point and thought that would be the only one orgasm I could ever have before her and that moment. But once my first, her and last, once I was one I couldn't remember, but two and never I didn't remember. It was two and only—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
