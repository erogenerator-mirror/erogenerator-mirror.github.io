Pyramus and Thisbe</h4><p><strong>About two-thirds of the way along the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, and in the rear of one of the most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood, where the various houses vie with</strong> each other, I was feeling a little bolder and more daring than usual. My plan was to pull out all of the stops, and just go with the flow. My cock is hard as marble, and as soon as I entered the front door, I could feel it throb, and I was surprised and excited.</p> <p>As soon as I opened the door, I could hear her on the phone, and I knew she had been talking to one of her friends, but who was she talking to? I opened the door and saw her in various stages of undress, and I knew it was just her friend. A quick check revealed she actually was taking one of her own clothes off when she sat down, but she was staring too much at my hard cock, and I felt a flood of excitement.</p> <p>It was that moment in the middle of conversation which I was now regretting. The excitement and fear that I was about to let something go, or hurt it so bad, was about to end up having the biggest, hardest moment of my life, though I wasn't about to stop until I had the chance to break free. When I pulled at my belt, she yanked it open and I was relieved when she pulled one of my boxers off from my body and laid it down before putting her left foot in my lap, where I was now naked except with my shirt, and she began to rock her hips, grinding against the bulge.</p> <p>When her body became sweaty, I knew she wanted to fuck again, and as my eyes closed and she began rocking faster, I realized she would never cum like that again. She was still rocking, grinding and sliding her body against mine, her pussy felt incredible against my cock though, and as soon as she felt it throb, she got a little wilder. She stopped and stood in front of me, slowly turning around, and I could see that she was biting her lower lips, and her eyes were closed. I stared at her, her back arched, and at full-length, I felt my cock throb while she pumped her hips forward from the front. "Fuck me," she whispered hoarsely.</p> <p>I leaned in and bit her neck while she did this, and she moaned and gasped, and when she looked over her shoulder at me, "Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me."</p> <p>"And do a good job," I said, and she moaned loudly that time. "I love fucking you—you are so beautiful—oh fuck."</p> <p>Her dirty talk started getting me more excited. I knew I couldn't take much more of her nasty comments anymore, so I decided to make this a memorable experience for both of us. "I want you to kiss me," I said, and she immediately dropped to her knees, put her hands near my mouth, and gently kissed my lips while she slowly strove to undress. My legs were shaking, and my hands were on the carpet in front of me to steady myself as I watched her. Once she was completely unbuttoned, she reached around to unzip my pants, and her hand pulled them to my ankles while I kept my eyes closed. She tossed my pants aside so she could continue to kiss my body while I watched her. She removed her hands from around her neck, and she looked in my eyes, and I could see her passion for me. Her hot mouth was so hard, hot, wet, wet, and I loved her like that, and she made me crazy just knowing she loved me and knew that it had been worth it for so long to do what she wanted.</p> <p>Then it happened, I'd never seen her so vulnerable. Her hands were shaking with pleasure; I know her nipples were pushing hard against the thin fabric of her dress while her tits moved with her movements, and I knew she was really getting into it with her boyfriend. I reached down with my free hand to rub her bare cunt through her panties, and when she started moving her hips up and down against me, she didn't hesitate. I could have stayed there any longer, but I pushed my fingers hard against the damp skin covering her crotch through her panties, to which she instantly started moaning and moaning louder with every movement of her hips toward me. When my fingers sank into the panties, the wetness there made them shine against my skin. My hand slipped under her pussy and caressed her clit as her own pussy lips pulled against my fingers, and as her moans rose into a scream of lust that escaped her mouth, I knew she was ready to cum again.</p> <p>There was a pause and her back arched, and she moaned into my mouth. "God, I love this. I love it, I love this. God, my fingers are so I love it," while I'm fucking you." It, this," she kept on my hands on my cock it, oh fuck, it, in me, I really it—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
