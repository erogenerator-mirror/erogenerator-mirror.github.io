This couple who I had always had a bit of a crush on was engaged to be married. My grandfather's wife and I were the ones to marry, that's my story. The couple we had the misfortune to be in between them, was of German stock that was worth about ten million Euros to our families bank account. The people who had all been to France with us on many months' holiday could all be my family, but they only made up for that in the short term.</p> <p>I loved their wedding. Although we had been at a university with three other German students, we were still going strong at the same school with many of our other friends. I never told her. We had always been close, just like we had always been around us, but we knew that we wouldn't be able to remain in close contact without being too strict.</p> <p>I loved kissing him. He really loves me kissing him. Maybe it's because I know he's had his share of women in his bed, but I know he's more than just a bit of fun, a great lover, as I love to be with him.</p> <p>Anyway, while we were kissing, he had unbuttoned my jeans and I had taken them one leg at a time down to the thigh-high pair I had just gotten from Zaftig. I still had my pink panties on underneath, but they're pretty sheer compared to a wet spot that was already forming.</p> <p>I was surprised to feel a warm, wet feeling on my thighs that was not only from his hand, but also I could feel every movement of his hand on my body. He rubbed it slowly, in and out from the tip of my little bud.</p> <p>He kissed down my neck, while his hand moved up and over my breast, massaging them through my bra. Then he kissed lower, to my navel. His fingers started to tease the top of my panties, while his other fingers, one finger found my wetness. I felt him push the fabric aside, and then I felt his thick finger slowly pushing it's way inside me.</p> <p>We both had some time together there, but we did not move. We just lay there on top of each other, his hand working up and down, massaging my breasts, kissing between bites all the way up to my lips. I loved kissing him so much that I wanted to feel the next few moments with him. And I thought about this last night. I think now I'm ready to feel more.</p> <p>His finger didn't move for a while, but kept rubbing slowly in and out of me. I really didn't want him to go anymore. Not at any moment, but a few seconds later I felt his hard cock enter my body, pushing the lips of my vagina against it, spreading them apart. And then it pushed itself into me with real force, making me cry out a little cry.</p> <p>He continued to push into me, slowly at first but gradually faster. After he was deep inside me, he pulled out, pulled up, and then slid back into me. We started to get into an rhythm. He started working his finger inside me as he slid back into me, which we both love, as well as having the sensation of his finger inside me. It was heavenly, being in each other's arms, not just in the bedroom.</p> <p>He slid up further and slid off me again. Once again he lay next to me on his back. We fell asleep together, in the bed. We were both wet, but there never was a real time for sex.</p> <p>To be continued -</p> <p>*You can't read this! It is only for real! Just a look at the above, and you can see a quick-witted old man who's trying to give you a good hard fuck after all. It's your time, but I promise later you won't regret it—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
