First, I want to thank everyone in the story. This story is not about me fucking someone just for a night. It is definitely about my desire to be fucked, to be used, taken, humiliated and humiliated again. So please take your time, enjoy this erotic story and, if it is a turn-on to you, make sure you're right in the middle of it. Enjoy, enjoy the story and the sex and you'll see what I mean when I go and you don't have to wait on me.</p> <p>Now, on with it! It gets so slow. I guess that was the main thing. I haven't done this long. I'll continue as I'm getting it done. Enjoy.</p> <p>Chapter 9</p> <p>As I said, this is very, very new. It was only just begun. It has a new twist to it. It has a plot. It has a plot. It has a plot to help you to enjoy and be pleased. It has an plot!</p> <p>This is the first part of my tale. Thank you!</p> <p>xH0Râ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
