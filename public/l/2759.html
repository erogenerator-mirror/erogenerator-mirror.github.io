I was in the Army and I ran into one of your buddies last summer. He saw the book 'It's A Day Out." He had that guy who was always trying to stay away from me until I got on my motorcycle and he didn't know what to do in time to stop me. We were riding together in his back seat, so he tried to kiss me but I stopped him. He took off his helmet, put his hand under my shirt and down my pants. He didn't dare stop there.</p> <p>"We went to his house. It was quite a party but it wasn't really any good. He said some girl was a total slut but he didn't think so."</p> <p>"I'm glad he didn't put her on the floor."</p> <p>"Of course not. He never liked her much. He told her not to call her a slut anymore.</p> <p>"What do you think, you've been dating her for a couple of months now?"</p> <p>"Well, if he was a whore she still wasn't interested."</p> <p>"No, that's not true, he did call her a slut."</p> <p>"Why didn't you call her one? Wouldn't that make your night with the loser a lot hotter?"</p> <p>"I guess not. But there is a first time for everything, you know. When I went back to my room he was sitting there, drinking beer with the girl of his dreams."</p> <p>"So you went for that girl of his dreams?"</p> <p>"If I had one, I would have, but he never told me what he'd do for it."</p> <p>"How long have you been doing this?"</p> <p>"About a month or so."</p> <p>"Why didn't you tell him?"</p> <p>"He would have gone for me."</p> <p>"Really? He didn't know what you would do for a girl?"</p> <p>"Yeah, maybe a woman. It was a little more than that."</p> <p>"What happened?"</p> <p>"He never gave me any choice. I gave him oral sex. I had a pretty high orgasm."</p> <p>I don't know where he knew that. But it doesn't take me long to figure out why he wanted to date.</p> <p>"The guy you were dating told you that you were a slut." I laughed.</p> <p>"That's right. What did he say about it?"</p> <p>"It was true. He never gave me any choice to go down on another guy, other than the ones I liked."</p> <p>"He didn't care about your first time did he?"</p> <p>"No, but that was the first time I gave any man oral sex. I had never had another man's cock in my mouth."</p> <p>"The first time you sucked a cock in your mouth?"</p> <p>"That's true. I'm not a slut. I suck cock all day. I'm just not a whore. All it seems to be concerned with is the pleasure of having a willing partner. I just enjoy giving head."</p> <p>"But I'm not a whore. Just a girl."</p> <p>"Why not? Just you go down on him and suck his balls. Then he put his cum into your mouth."</p> <p>She hesitated, but she didn't object.</p> <p>"The guy doesn't know what you like. I never liked the taste of my own cum before. I had to suck it out of his cum. I did that every day after that, so now it's always been a pleasure."</p> <p>"So you like sucking a guy's cock?"</p> <p>"You want me to suck your pussy?"</p> <p>"Do you want to?"</p> <p>"Definitely."</p> <p>We both laughed.</p> <p>"When's your next one?"</p> <p>"Next week."</p> <p>She hesitated. "Do you have a boyfriend?"</p> <p>"I have a boyfriend, don't you want one?" I was getting ready to cum in my pants, I was so ready.</p> <p>"No, I don't have a boyfriend."</p> <p>"Then you have that problem."</p> <p>"What problem?"</p> <p>"I just can't take an opportunity to have a big cock in my pussy."</p> <p>"Then I don't even have a cock."</p> <p>"Oh, do you want one?"</p> <p>"Oh, do you have a cock?"</p> <p>"Sure I do."</p> <p>her breasts heaviness is gone, so was her arousal. She took a pause. I had her hand under my shirt off. I wanted to pull my pants completely naked unders, she grabbed her breasts.</p> <p>was her and cupping my cock.
