English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>XLIX. THE BEDWARFING VIRTUE.</h4><p><strong>When Zarathustra was again on the continent, he did not go straightway to his mountains and his cave, but made many wanderings and questionings, and ascertained this and that; so</strong> he became a historian.</p> <p>It was to one of his favourite books which his father took as a 'joint' of his mind as far as he was concerned.</p> <p>When Zarathustra's father saw his daughter, he was surprised and stunned. He was even more shocked when he saw that she, being an educated and intelligent girl, had a body, too. He didn't even imagine that he'd have a body the body of a beautiful woman, and yet, he was nonetheless surprised to see it, and wonder what she's like.</p> <p>"Well, you must be hungry, old bird," he observed. "We could go for a meal!"</p> <p>Chapter 7</p> <p>Lying to him in the morning, he thought he saw her. Then he saw it again. She was in his bed with him. She smiled at him. Then she kissed him. Then she kissed his nipples. Then she sucked his dick. He was astonished. He was even more amazed than shocked when she put her lips on her lips and put them on his cock. He almost did the same thing. It was then and still is still is the same way.</p> <p>For Zarathustras time was up. He had to say. When it became clear that he was about to receive the same pleasures that Lina was about to receive, his cock hardened and erected in his hand. He touched it, he rubbed it.</p> <p>"Lina," he whispered. "I love you."</p> <p>"Me?" she asked, "You mean to say that?"</p> <p>"Yes, you mean to say that I love you."</p> <p>"I mean, well. Yes, I mean to say it."</p> <p>"I have always loved you Lina."</p> <p>"I have always loved you, too. I am sure you were special, beautiful Lina."</p> <p>"And I always have been special, beautiful Lina."</p> <p>"Well, perhaps I am special," she replied. "I love to kiss and to lick and play with your cock and your balls."</p> <p>While she said that, he started to masturbate it. Then she licked his balls and cock.</p> <p>"I want to do it again," she said.</p> <p>"No I don't want to," he replied. "It's a fantasy. Besides I'm horny too, you know. Can't imagine a better way to play with my cock and balls than to play with your tits."</p> <p>While he was lying on his back, Lina straddling his leg, began to rub her pussy on his erect cock, and then she lowered her head and began to lick his cock and balls. By the time Lina was sucking his cock, the cock was ready to enter her pussy. She took it in easily enough, and began to ride him.</p> <p>"Come on!" she said. "Let me ride you!"</p> <p>Before he got his pleasure, she lifted her legs and, spreading herself, took his cock deep inside of her and rode him. He put his hands on her ass and enjoyed her riding him as she reached out and touched his cock. She pulled him up over her so that he was hovering over hers before she sat astride him and impaled herself on his cock.</p> <p>"Come," she said.</p> <p>She said that by saying it aloud.</p> <p>He replied, "Yes, Lina."</p> <p>"Come, love," she said.</p> <p>He was getting his pleasure. This could be his last orgasm in a few months.</p> <p>It wasn't just that he enjoyed being inside her, there was the fact that this was very familiar, as they had once done, with the previous night and again this morning. This time he didn't get the sensation that what they had done in the past, had so recently and so much to do, was so, to do. The real meaning of that was, as usual, was that they had done their act of lovemaking very deliberately to fulfill their shared desire, and that their lovemaking was without reserve and with no regard for anything else.</p> <p>"This time," she said, lifting herself and going backwards. "As soon as I was about to get your sperm, I also came and you got mine."</p> <p>She kept him above her and sat on his face so that he could lick her as she held his head and fucked his mouth, but not yet she entered herself to take him also inside her.</p> <p>When he saw his beautiful Lina lying above him, he was in a state of amazement. He wanted to take her to orgasm, but he couldn't.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"Lina," he said, he saw</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>" I know not, I want?
