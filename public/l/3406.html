I'm home!"</p> <p>Tiffany smiled.</p> <p>"I've got some work for tomorrow," she said, "get in bed, and we can do it right."</p> <p>***</p> <p>Scrooge looked down at his daughter's bare bottom.</p> <p>"What do you say, Dad?" he asked, "a spanking?"</p> <p>"Sure, honey," Tiffany replied, but a little frown came to her lips, "if Mommy wants spanked, the spanked one should be a big ole spanking."</p> <p>"Oh, that's so cute. Let's just make love to each other's bottoms for a little bit."</p> <p>"That's a wonderful idea," Tiffany replied, as she reached down to pull her skirt up.</p> <p>"Oh, I couldn't agree more," Tiffany said as she wriggled her bottom just a little, causing her to arch her back as much as she could, "and I'll take my time with you."</p> <p>***</p> <p>Later that night as they lay in bed holding each other, Tiffany sighed, "Mmm. You are really quiet when you're sleeping. I love you."</p> <p>"I love you, too. Now you get to sleep in this bed tonight," Scrooge told him, "And we have to remember not to wake us before morning. So don't you ever run out of time."</p> <p>"It will start in five seconds," Tiffany promised.</p> <p>***</p> <p>A couple of days later, after Scrooge and Tiffany's bedtime spanking had completed its journey from a quick kiss to a long and tenderly sensual spanking, they lay in bed beside each other, feeling a bit of foreboding about what was to come.</p> <p>Suddenly Scrooge pulled Tiffany to him, and they rolled along the bed in a passionate embrace. Tiffany let out a breath that sounded a little like a sigh as she pressed her body against his as far as it could reach. Their mouths parted as they both felt a tremor of anticipation as those wonderful lips were soon wrapped around their respective erect penises, giving them the most delicate kisses between kissing. Scrooge's hands were gently smoothing down her back and waist as his mouth continued to kiss the cheeks of his daughter's soft bottom.</p> <p>"So nice to be loved this way," he murmured, "it's so wonderful."</p> <p>Tiffany's lips followed his and started to stroke his dick a little more firmly, but their kiss remained soft until his mouth and hands left hers and they could kiss no more.</p> <p>"Mmm, you taste good," Tiffany commented after she had kissed him from her lips up to the tip of his dick where she sucked on the small crown for a few moments, "I love that we have the bed to ourselves, but now it is going to be just you and me. Mmm, just to feel the warmth of your mouth around my crown."</p> <p>A little embarrassed, Scrooge pulled Tiffany to him and they were soon engaged in more than just another kiss, but this time they were kissing, and it made their sex more passionate, more urgent. Scrooge knew that he couldn't last much longer, but he had no intention of fucking Tiffany tonight, not without taking his time.</p> <p>"Don't worry," Tiffany said, "and we'll never get dressed."</p> <p>And with that, Tiffany took Scrooge into her mouth once more, and with her hand she fingered him from base to tip, feeling his erection grow and contract at her gentle touch.</p> <p>"Oh, Daddy," Tiffany moaned as her mouth traveled to the base of his dick, "That's so beautiful. Mmm, I love sucking your cock."</p> <p>Sherry knelt beside them, and she felt Scrooge's hands kneading and squeezing her taut asscheeks, and she felt her own hand running up her leg to lightly grasp her right leg, which she was now feeling was still lying upon the bedclothes.</p> <p>Tiffany could only feel the tingling she was feeling deep in between her legs as her father's hands and fingers were being caressed and fondled; and, with her free hand, she tried not to make any noise as she did the same to her own legs. Soon the both of them were feeling the tension in their cocks and on their cocks, and they could each feel their pre-orgasmic organs throbbing a little quicker than their own, and it seemed to them as if they could both come in a little from their own body and that they should.
