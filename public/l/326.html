A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind</strong> it and as he stepped out of the small closet, a soft, wet washcloth brushed past his left shoulder to wipe the staining and the sticky fluid residue from his skin. "Golly, you did put my hair in a ponytail. Thank you, you're really beautiful," he murmured.</p> <p>Stately looked up. "Are you okay?" he asked, taking the washcloth in his hand to wipe a white bead of lather off his brow.</p> <p>"My hair is dry now. I just want to rinse in the basin, please."</p> <p>"Well, don't just wash it, make more."</p> <p>"Yeah. I mean, I don't want to get rid of the smell, of all the makeup on you today. Please?"</p> <p>"Of course!" She stood on one leg for a moment, turning to face him with her hands raised above her head to rinse and rinse her hair.</p> <p>While taking a few minutes for herself to rinse off, she turned and looked him directly in the eyes, a question on her face that they both answered easily.</p> <p>"Babe, what did the bathroom sink look like?" He cupped each of her tits again, holding them up in his palms as if weighing them and stroking them.</p> <p>His erection jumped when he found her nipples had hardened, and she was squirming with delight while they rubbed together.</p> <p>"Your boobs! Your boobs are so beautiful," he told her.</p> <p>He felt her breasts shift slightly. "You're such a horny teenager."</p> <p>Buck nodded, then turned her over. "This is going to be an incredible day, and I want you so bad." His hands slipped down her belly; she lifted her hips and they were left on the cold tile floor of the bathroom. She held back a moan.</p> <p>"Are you sure that's what you want, sweetheart? Is that how you wanted it? You want it to be right here on the tile when you kiss me, too? Do you want to see me being happy now, having you over my lap, spanking my ass like you just did?"</p> <p>Her head came up after a moment and his hands joined. The touch of their hands sent an excited thrill through her. She pushed his hands away and leaned forward, presenting herself to him like a slut. "Babe? You're my slave. I'm your sex slave. You're my dirty little bitch." He dropped his knees to take her nipple between his teeth and bit her gently. Buck gasped as she arched her back and pressed her breasts to his mouth, arching up and into him as he did. She held onto his head as he sucked at her swollen bud until she could not hold back.</p> <p>His hands left her breasts for a moment so he could turn her around so he could kiss her, which he did, pressing her into the tub with his knee.</p> <p>"Now, sweetheart, let me do the honors," he murmured. "Let me help you rinse."</p> <p>Bending a little, he took away the wadded up cloth and his hand with which he washed her skin. He washed all the way to her belly button, the area just above it with his wet tongue and fingers, which tickled her until she squirmed and pulled him to her. Buck had never allowed anyone else to wash his way there. The way she felt about him was amazing. "Oh, God! Please?" His hands held firmly to the edges of the tub, pressing her to it the whole way, and she raised her hips and pressed her ass back into him.</p> <p>Buckle lifted her hands and her fingers found his hard cock again. "Are you sure? It feels like a big cock, sweetheart," she whispered.</p> <p>"That's a fact, baby. You were the one that did the work. Now I'll show you how to use that big dick."</p> <p>Buckle took her hand and placed it on his hard penis. With the water running down it, a wet finger and thumb separated as he helped her guide his cock in. When he felt her fingers curl around his cock, he was certain he had it in.</p> <p>They were both wet with his saliva and the soap they had washed on this weekend; it was a lather of different colors and textures. Her fingers were hot and slippery as they held on to him so he could only hold it in so long. She had not realized he could hold himself so long. "You don't like that, do you?" she asked.</p> <p>"No, I love it." And it isn't every weekend that a little lady's so wet and slippery that much better. I can't be done in you."</p> <p></p> <p>"You're the way, sweetheart?"</p> <p>"Oh, nice?" "," she giggled and " " and, yesâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
