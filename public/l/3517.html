It was perfect weather to lay naked and spread out on the bed before the stars, to take advantage of the warm night air. I was hard as a rock. She lay stretched out across my body. We kissed. That was all that mattered.</p> <p>She kissed my lips first, then my throat and my chest. My hands moved slowly over her back, massaging gently. Her neck. Her shoulders, my fingers roved gently up to the nape of her neck. I could feel every muscle in her body move under my hand. The feeling was sensual. There was no resistance. No need just to go with the flow.</p> <p>I had never been with a woman before. I wanted to be better yet.</p> <p>"Oh fuck," she whispered as our lips parted and our bodies moved further into each other. Her touch was sensual. Like a cat.</p> <p>My hand moved down her back to her buttocks.</p> <p>I rubbed her through the silk panties in my hands. I began to explore her with my hand. She opened her legs for me, giving me access to her pussy.</p> <p>I touched her there. My fingers moved down between her legs, finding her bare and juicy wet pussy. My fingers opened her gently, finding that sensitive spot between the top of her thigh and the top of her lower body. She closed her eyes now.</p> <p>I began to press in there, making her body jump and move against me. I was feeling so good, so right.</p> <p>Her eyes opened. She looked into my eyes. Her hand moved down into my shorts, searching for my cock.</p> <p>My cock was erect in my shorts, I was so hard. She held on to it.</p> <p>My cock was getting sore though. I couldn't take it anymore.</p> <p>My hand moved down her back. I explored her ass. I explored her ass. I was going to cum for her right then. I knew how to masturbate.</p> <p>It was a tight little ass. Her sphincter. I spread it wider with my fingers, I began to push it into her. I was touching her rectum. Her head moved back, I lifted her chin, and began to kiss her neck, my lips and her shoulders, and her body. I kissed every scrap of skin she had on those beautiful curves of her, every delicious inch of her naked ass. I kissed down one side of her neck. I kissed the other side then my tongue moved into that warm center of her being. As I kissed my way there, my tongue licked the insides of her thighs. She shivered. Her back arched when I went to lick her wet pussy.</p> <p>My body was shaking. I was so hot.</p> <p>Her pussy was like an offering. She reached down between her legs, searching for and finding my cock. She took my cock as my fingers explored her pussy. I reached under, cupping her tits and playing with her nipples. In slow motion, I felt her body tremble. Her hands grasped onto me, searching for me. I felt her hand grasp my cock when she felt it throb with my fingers in her pussy.</p> <p>I pulled her hair back. I felt her mouth on my cock. I opened my eyes, our eyes met, and I found her mouth open as she tried to take my cock into her mouth. My eyes went wide as she sucked as much of it as she could down her throat, but it was so much bigger and more swollen than my cock. I opened my eyes to see her staring at me and her mouth open, trying to take more in.</p> <p>My cock was still hard. I had never been harder, but my cock felt so hard against her body. Her legs spread more as she began to fuck her mouth on it. I felt her hand move around my head while the rest of me lay on her back. She sucked me harder, and I felt her fingers rub her pussy, her thighs move up and down. I took her head in my palms and moved so she could take more and more of my cock in her mouth.</p> <p>Her hands started to move faster, she was getting faster.</p> <p>Her face glistened. Her eyes glowed. I could see it. I could see the intensity in the moonlight. I could see things that I didn't see before now. The pleasure was all consuming.</p> <p>I pushed my face down, tasting her, letting the feeling take over from the feeling on my cock. I took it all and sucked as much as I could into her mouth as deeply as possible on it. She began to fit around. It, over and into my tongue and tongue and on.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>And in mouth. It, My cock and I could go Yes—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
