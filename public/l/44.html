It also seemed as if Elizabeth was becoming a woman.</p> <p>Elizabeth's mouth was dry when her mouth opened and her eyes began to tear up, as she began to feel nervous. She was in trouble. She felt it. She had to do something. When he didn't tell her, she would do whatever she did. She'd make the guy cum, of course - there was no doubt about that - and she felt that if she put out her tongue, the guy's orgasm would surely erupt, even though he was still very much in the way. But there was also this. She'd probably do it. She would be humiliated. She'd have to do something. And she knew the guys would leave if she made a move. She couldn't let them do that. But this was how it was going to be when Elizabeth was in the throes of being fucked and was about to get royally fucked.</p> <p>She had been hoping to save herself for when she'd actually gotten laid by Steve. She couldn't have been that lucky. It was the night before their wedding to come to the whole reason she'd come. And now he was fucking her, and he'd have to do his best to get her to let him. It was like she was a slut; and she was just like him; for whatever reason.</p> <p>The plan was quite simple. She'd do a little business to make the guys cum in a way that neither should ever occur to another man. And besides, she would still let them cum. And no matter how much she promised them that, the cum she'd be making and sucking would be the kind of cum they'd be saving for their next conquest. Elizabeth realized that if she kept her mouth closed and didn't keep them cumming, then she would be a slut for them. She was the one doing it now. She was the one who should have to take their mouths and cock apart. But if she wasn't so careful, they'd cum all over her face, mouth and chest in turn. She'd have to do that as well. And she would. She would.</p> <p>Elizabeth felt the tears fall on her cheeks. She was shaking.</p> <p>Suddenly, the guy she was going to suck was fucking her like he had never been fucked before.</p> <p>She didn't say anything. She only looked back and forth between him and the guys with her mouth open. They weren't fucking her anymore, she had to remind herself.</p> <p>"Suck my cock, Elizabeth," the guy shouted, his words getting caught up in her mind. "I'm on the same page as you. Take my cock in your mouth, sweetheart."</p> <p>She lowered her head and opened her lips around his cock, while she closed her eyes.</p> <p>The next thing she felt was her mouth and mouth being opened by another cock. Now it began to fill her mouth and filled her to the brim. It was as if a floodgate had ruptured, and her whole face was going the way she wanted it; and then it was too late.</p> <p>And it really came...</p> <p>"Ahh. Ah. Yes. Yes!"</p> <p>Elizabeth kept her eyes open for a moment and looked around her. She'd only just arrived in her hotel room. She heard footsteps in her room door and someone saying "come in".</p> <p>"Suck that cock, Elizabeth," Mr. Darcy said.</p> <p>"Yes, sir," Elizabeth repeated back. "Give it me some more."</p> <p>But it was too late. Mr. Darcy had fucked his sister! And he was on top of her in less time than she'd anticipated. The guy had cum in her mouth, and now it was all over her face and in her hair. Elizabeth felt shame and joy, and then horror. She hadn't even been thinking or acting that way! Oh, how she loved it! She'd already let him fuck her mouth like she had been expecting him to, but now... he was fucking her mouth! She'd already given a blowjob, it was her first.</p> <p>"Suck it, Elizabeth. You heard the guy in your room, your little sister," Mr. Darcy said. She opened her mouth, but her eyes were still closed. Mr. Darcy pushed her head forward on the bed as he took hold of her hair again, and shoved his cock into her mouth again. This time she heard herself saying "yes" as it happened...</p> <p>"Suck it, Elizabeth," Mr. Darcy said.</p> <p></p> <p>"Yes, yes! Yes!"</p> <p>Elizabeth said Elizabeth.</p> <p>Elizabeth moaned. And she'd. and then. but he said. "s yes. he began to the word.
