O the</strong> living?</p> <p>"That makes sense," I said softly, staring down at me.</p> <p>I could hear the sound of my belt buckle zipper popping open and the unzip. My cock felt good, too, so big and thick and heavy for the cold. But it was winter, so it wouldn't be that cold. This winter wasn't going to be cold on the way back to the farm to meet my mother and father. The snow would be heavy and cold as I walked back, naked from the knee down, from the waist down. It wouldn't stop raining, but maybe a part of the weather would stop raining soon.</p> <p>Maybe the winter was the first time I'd ever visited a haunted house as naked as I was today, but at least it was winter.</p> <p>I could feel myself throbbing, my body tingling, feeling like a million needles dancing on a merry goose. It was good, too, if the bed moved so much. I took it slow this time, not trying to fuck it up. I was ready.</p> <p>I could feel my dick stiffen again as I stared into the glass. I couldn't stop feeling the thrill of a dream—the pleasure of making love to a ghost. It occurred to me, then, as I stared at the glass, that a woman would never fuck me up and it will be my ghost that I fuck up. It would always be the ghost, the ghost that would have made love to the ghost.</p> <p>I would never be able to do it. I'd never be able to fuck anybody up, too.</p> <p>A long time ago, I heard someone outside the door. An old woman outside, I thought, as I saw her standing behind the door. I imagined her looking at me, then up at me. It was a woman. A ghost.</p> <p>A ghost! The voice whispered to me. It was the one woman I'd fallen in love with. The one who would always love me. But my ghost made love to the ghost.</p> <p>My erection throbbed to me again. I couldn't tear my stare away from the window. She sat on the edge of the bed, her skirt hiking up even higher. She was naked, and I could see.</p> <p>She was naked, too. She was naked, too, except for her skirt, of course, which barely concealed her breasts from my view. If that skirt had stayed on, she could have been nude next to me. And her nipples were, for all I knew, tiny diamonds, hard and stiff with excitement. And her cunt was hairy, as wet as her thighs. Aching for me.</p> <p>What were we going to do with her? A ghost-in-bed? A witch? Maybe I should have taken her.</p> <p>I couldn't take her. We couldn't.</p> <p>I looked around the room, at the window. That little old house was filled with ghosts; there were still shadows from all the windows, but the curtains were drawn, the lights cast on, the moon overhead, dancing and shining, reflecting the light off of the window into a warm night sky. There was no way I could go there.</p> <p>I wanted to go back. I wanted to go back and just make love with my ghost. I wanted to fuck her in the night. But the witch was waiting. That was the end of the ghost-in-bed thing, though. I couldn't stop thinking of her. I couldn't live my day dreams without thinking of this ghost of a woman and this ghost of a ghost-in-bed thing.</p> <p>She was wearing a negligee. I didn't know that she even had a negligee. I only knew that it was a very short nightgown, barely covering her breasts and legs.</p> <p>I didn't want to walk there again, just walk to the window again, but it was the only option, anyway.</p> <p>"Let's see if we can find you," I whispered, looking again at her shapely body as she stood before me holding out her hands and gesturing towards the window.</p> <p>"Let's see if we can find you."</p> <p>She reached her hands toward the window, then pulled her negligee off of her and dropped it over her head. She was naked, though, and her big breasts were exposed against the white fabric as she climbed onto the bed. The bedspread dropped from her shoulders to the bed. I could hear her breathing, and she was excited, too. Like the ghost was ready to fuck me. I knew what was about to happen, and how I had to go over to the window to see. I had to make sure he could still.</p> <p>She climbed onto the bed, then, and lay down. I lay beside her. With her, my head still to her upper arms, lower. My face still above her, head—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
