English by Fyodor Dostoyevsky </h3><h4>CHAPTER VII</h4><p><strong>The same day, about seven o’clock in the evening, Raskolnikov was on his way to his mother’s and sister’s lodging—the lodging in Bakaleyev’s house which Razumihin had found for them.</strong> He knew his mom wanted him to come too. Razumihin was so hot, she’d even had a boyfriend a week ago, only to be thrown out on her head for being so uptight about the ‘old woman’. He didn’t want to have trouble with his family, as it was, he’d rather be free as the blue skies of Russian Spring.</p> <p>She had wanted him to come. She was so hot. She was so sexy. Her big tits jiggled in the white silk blouse with the black silk belt hanging out. His cock jumped as he remembered the feel of her soft skin against his chest. He’d kissed her hard and she had screamed in passion. Now he was her son, and it wasn’t an incestuous thing. But he loved his mother even more. She was his mother and he’d loved her for so long, but somehow he needed to know she was truly his mother. And the fact that he was her son wasn’t the only reason his cock ached.</p> <p>“It was a good idea,” his mother said as he arrived home in Kysmád and went inside their bedroom. Both of them were alone, and both of them had no secrets of their own.</p> <p>She had called her brother Raskolnikov. Raskolnikov’s first name was Rasklena and he’d told her his name was Rasklina. Rasklina called him Rasklina because his mother loved his name. Rasklina was her name, too. He liked her, though, so he let her call him Rasklina and he would be her son, whether her father did he not know?</p> <p>Danka knew they had sex when she was sleeping—which is often on all fours in her bed. She was awake, too, and when she got up, when he got up, she couldn’t get the sheet up over his naked body and she’d wake up with a hard, sore dick. But she also knew what his mother’s pussy looked like when she got up in the morning, and what she did in the mornings she slept in. The night before Rasklina and her boyfriend’s party, she used to lie naked in bed and watch while Rasklina used the toilet.</p> <p>Danka had masturbated with her vibrator while she watched her son cum. She kept imagining herself lying on the sofa, her wet pussy throbbing against her fingers as her son’s prick rammed inside her. They kept fucking, he telling her how to use it, she telling him not to stop, he telling her how much he loved fucking his mother, he describing the feel of her soft, smooth pussy as a soft, cum-juice coated cunt.</p> <p>“I used to be so proud of this,” Danka murmured as they got into a rhythmic fucking session.</p> <p>“Then I’d fuck you,” Razumahin had finished telling them their incestuous sex.</p> <p>“But then when I had my period, we weren’t able to have sex right away,” Rasklina told him. He remembered, too, the sweet, passionate way her legs were wrapped around him and her ankles were clamped behind his back.</p> <p>“That was an honor to her,” Rasklina agreed with her own daughter.</p> <p>“So you know I don’t have to be in the bedroom to take care of my baby,” Razumahin said.</p> <p>“I know.”</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>A month or two later, at the end of a particularly busy and sexy period for the Russian-speaking American female author, she was a new author with whom she’d met through a literary magazine’s web contact. She was a woman in her late thirties, with the same strong, athletic legs and ass that she’d described. The fact she was a girl, though, rather, only made it hotter to say her name and her body was spectacularly fit and sexy nonetheless.</p> <p>She was sitting in a white recliner with her knees drawn up under her, reading a book with a pen, when Rasklina stepped into the living room. She wore a pale white silk robe over a gray blouse and her hair was in a pony tail.</p> <p>’knight. She looked so sexy, so much like the American girl she had been told in his letter to get in the story the magazine.
