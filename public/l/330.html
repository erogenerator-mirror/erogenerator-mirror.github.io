Could have given that address too. And past</strong> to what. Then the road. By then the rain was coming in heavy, not coming on this road. But why not? Didn't matter how much time had gone</p> <p>By now Windmill lane was deserted. Just a couple of people inside he asked. Not quite sure why he knew it, but some of the men were watching, probably looking at her. Oh I hope she is just one of those. What a pity to be watched by the men! He wondered, and felt, that he did now have some sense of what a "sex" lady was, and what a real "woman". Not just any woman, an ordinary lady, as Jane, Jane had shown him. But what happened to such a pretty, innocent, and, now, obviously "proper?", "sexy", as Jane had done?</p> <p>At the end of the road he saw just a man and a woman who didn't seem to be coming out of the gate. Mr Hugo had not bothered taking the next one. Now the woman was gone, in all her splendid, naked, beautiful beauty. Now Mr Hugo stepped down the stairs, and took Mr Hugo in an embrace and a long kiss on his lips, and at some level, had an idea of what the old saying was for a kiss, how it was used, what people, now so important to Jane, were supposed to do. Then as the kiss broke, Mr Hugo said to the older gentleman, "That is Jane."</p> <p>Then he walked to Mr Hugo to be kissed again, this time with an open mouth and full of tongue, and he kissed it first, and on the tip of Mr Hugo's tongue, then on a little lower lip. Mr Hugo pulled out, and asked Mr Hugo to kiss it also with an open mouth. He felt Mr Hugo's kiss for a moment, then he felt his lips meet his own lips again. After a second kiss in full, Mr Hugo pushed him away and asked Mr Hugo to kiss his neck. As soon as Mr Hugo's lips met his cheek, Mr Hugo slid his hand down to Mr Hugo's cock, where he began to stroke and fondle him, feeling the man-flesh, then caressing it as he had felt when he had kissed another man. He wondered, at first, what he would be like, if it was Mr Hugo.</p> <p>Mr Hugo moved again, and this time he put one of his arms around Mr Hugo's neck, pulled him closer, and slid a hand down into his trousers, fondling his cock. Mr Hugo too went back and forth kissing his face and the sides of his neck, and Mr Hugo slid his hand under Mr Hugo's T-shirt, found he was still wearing underwear, and began to fondle Mr Hugo's cock. The older man began to suck on one of Mr Hugo's nipples, whilst slipping fingers under the trousers, into his own cock. In this way, the two men were kissing each other quite hard, Mr Hugo's and Mr Hugo's mouths were wide open, tongues duelling.</p> <p>But as Mr Hugo was almost fully erect now, Mr Hugo was afraid that all would come to a stop, and he pulled away from Mr Hugo. He took Mr Hugo's hand, put it under his own trousers and took hold of Mr Hugo's cock. Mr Hugo had to admit that Mr Hugo's own penis was very similar to what Mr Hugo's might have. Mr Hugo reached for Mr Hugo's cock, feeling its weight and length, and was amazed that Mr Hugo, who used to be only eighteen, could even get hard so quickly. Mr Hugo pushed Mr Hugo's trousers with his other hand out of the way, and said,</p> <p>"Take me home, Mr Hugo, and fuck me. I'll cook for the next forty-five minutes."</p> <p>Now Mr Hugo turned to Mrs Hugo, put his arms round her back, kissed her again. And Mr Hugo slipped his hand under his own shirt again, found his own cock, and began to stroke it. Mrs Hugo, a married woman of thirty years, and not to mention very lovely to make love to, began to kiss him back, and stroke him. She was a beautiful, old woman, she was even older than Mr Hugo, and could have been more like Mr Hugo, but she wanted all the same to pleasure him.</p> <p>Mr Hugo was not so much aroused as excited, but more than enough. He felt his ejaculate begin to rise, as he thought he was about to come. Mr Hugo stood up and led him out the side of the house, out of sight of the street. He told Mrs Hugo to get her under a sheet, and to lie down on the carpet, on, on her face, side away from the street, so that she was her head, the street, which way on the road was dark. But Mr Hugo used to be seen, and side were not the road—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
