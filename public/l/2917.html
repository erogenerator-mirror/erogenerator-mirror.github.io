For as touching the Common-wealth</strong> in such an intimate caress as you, shall we both call for a kiss, not only of marriage but also a kiss between man and man. That kiss is for me, not for men.</p> <p>When the boy is in your arms, and our lips are at the mouth, do we kiss on the forehead?</p> <p>It is the proper thing to do. It is the right thing to do.</p> <p>In the end we kiss. Kiss on the lips. Kiss on the mouth. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss the ear.</p> <p>"Oh, God, yes!"</p> <p>"Is that good?"</p> <p>"Mm-huh, just like..."</p> <p>"Are you going to come?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes. Go for me!"</p> <p>At my request the boy slides down and sits himself behind me in the way and the way that my husband is. It's not easy, but at least I can move and move the way that I want. There's plenty of room. So the boy gets down and sits himself behind me. I feel his hands on my hips, and I know that he's ready. I slide my dress up a little to allow it to slide down a little better. He does this quickly, and then slips two fingers between my thighs, in search of a more wet hole than where I've already been. A little of juice seems to flow and leak from me, but now it is not enough to lubricate a good finger. He makes a bit of a show of trying to find the most sensitive area of my pussy. He does this, and all the way down to the first joint of my ass. He then slides down to the rim and slowly and easily enters me with his whole finger.</p> <p>"That's it!"</p> <p>"That is so hot!" I agree, as he begins to slide out and in, and in, and out. Back and forth, up and down. This is no gentle finger fuck I know for a man. This is a kind of man-on-man lovemaking, while I was on the bed where it is not permitted. As I say once, I didn't have to take off any panties after coming or taking them off for just a moment. But now my bottom is out of bounds entirely, and I feel like a slut, even if all I wanted to say is "Let me have a bit of my own back there, let me watch"—as men do to their women. But when it comes to me, well, I don't think I ever have much control.</p> <p>"Oh, it's so, so good."</p> <p>"It's good for you!"</p> <p>"Oh, that's good!"</p> <p>"That's good."</p> <p>"I'm getting there!"</p> <p>"Go for it!"</p> <p>It's not often, but I like to be told what to do and feel, so I say: "Go for it. Oh, God, it does feel good!"</p> <p>The boy slides his finger out of me and then back up to the opening of my sex and begins to slowly work his finger in and out of me. There is no more of a hurry to hurry. It's just the right time and place. It's just the right sensation. It's just the way to feel a man inside you while we both are on his bed, kissing, touching, masturbating, or fucking and satisfying others. Oh, God, it's as hot and good as that. Not just the physical sex. It's, without a doubt, the hottest physical lovemaking imaginable.</p> <p>It's time to go for all the fun that is, and to do, what I can't do. I want to be a naughty girl, too. I want to be a girl with only one thing she can't. There is no other word to describe the fact that I want a nice big man. I want a nice big man who can, and might do, whatever I want at whatever I say. But, in this room, to be a good, willing cunnilingus, no woman wants the man. And the boy, well, it's up to him. And he has no choice but to follow the rules. But I think that if I was to go for this all the way for a week, I might do it again.</p> <p>So that is what happen. The boy puts me into the car at last. It's not difficult for him. We have a way with men, don't we? I can tell that by the way the boy slides into the car, in the way that his hands are reaching around me, to my back or under me. He has so much to learn. He takes charge.</p> <p></p> <p>I'm ready to get fucked, if I say.</p> <p></p> <p>He's about to go for my man-for my man;</p> <p>to fuck</p> <p>any any. I want—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
