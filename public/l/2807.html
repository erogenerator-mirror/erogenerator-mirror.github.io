The Divine Law is that we must follow them as best as we can!</p> <p>But it is only a beginning, and I will now go to that law of Life, which applies to all human beings. That law gives us a right to have sex with animals and creatures who are in the physical and, in fact... well, not animals and creatures, it is not a law, it is a principle law of Nature, which has been established in a sense and on the basis of the Law. Nature may or may not recognize that fact, and in that time, it may not even be the law that is law, but rather the Law of Theology. The Divine Law is a principle law between us; of us, and our creatures, of us. It has had many of its own laws.</p> <p>"A dog or a cat can be given any law within our own mind and we can do anything as well as we can and can't," said the Law of Nature, which I said as much to myself because it gave me, and all others, a license to be a good and obedient dog. Yes, this was just the first and of the most basic laws, like what we humans were taught to do in college when it was our turn to live and we were told to sit down. The Law is the Law which makes sense to us, because if we live in the law of Nature, we will always be free. And it follows, when we obey the Divine Law, we will follow it more than any other law.</p> <p>"We have no God, but all do. We have all the laws which make sense to us; how was your first Sunday morning, dear? Did you please me, dear?" asked the Law of Nature, which made me feel good and glad, but made me question the wisdom of the Law of Nature. It is just so hard to obey, but in a certain way, and I do it very much.</p> <p>"Yes, I did, dear," I answered.</p> <p>"Did you feel it, sweet?" she was being very thoughtful and tender. I did feel it, but couldn't understand why.</p> <p>"Yes, I felt it," I answered.</p> <p>"Do you think I am wise with this law of the Heavens, dear? Did you think I was wise enough to know and understand anything about it? Am I wise enough, little fellow, to believe?"</p> <p>"Yes, you are," I replied. I was about to answer them, but thought better of asking my self why I didn't. "You are wise, but you aren't wise enough to keep this law, like it is a Law which is a precepts law. There is nothing that you or I can do about this Law of Nature, since you both agreed to follow it."</p> <p>"I think that I need to be a wise man to help you with this Law," was her reply.</p> <p>"But what is it, sweet? Just because you agreed to help me and I said yes, and gave me that same law, doesn't that have any influence, as you have?"</p> <p>"Yes, you're right, but not all of it, is there? You can't tell me that all of it was a mere fact that any one of you agreed to do," she was trying to get me to believe, but I don't realize all that she meant. But she was trying to convince me.</p> <p>"That's very nice, dear," I replied, so much so that we both realized that we were talking to each others' minds.</p> <p>"If you don't mind, what may we do next, before we go again? I think we could, if we went to the Law of Theology," she added.</p> <p>"What are you saying, dear?"</p> <p>"Do something, or rather, don't anything just to have it done to you?" she was making me feel more and more worried by my own words.</p> <p>"There's no way that a dog or a cat can do it," I explained.</p> <p>"Oh, yes there is, darling, there is. I would be quite happy if we did it and did it as a dog or cat, so to speak."</p> <p>"That's okay, dear," I answered. So did she. "I would love to do that and do all those things when we're in the Law, and not as humans as we are here. That is how you will be taught to follow these and so many other laws, dear."</p> <p>"But, but, how will it even be done? Have it is so important to not just us, for you, to have sex with each other people, to have all of us," she tried to have sex with sex with other, as we have," she had as herâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
