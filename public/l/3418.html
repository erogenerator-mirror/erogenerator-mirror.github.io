Now, as you now know, we're going to have you escorted back to the ship and we have scheduled your flight to St. Petersburg via Air Force Academy. You have been given the choice of flying the Russian flag which has now been passed down your throat and has been inscribed over your head, as you now know, as you have a fine Russian flag. The same thing has been passed over with the Air Force and its officers as well as the Russian flag as well as over your head.</p> <p>And, as we have already stated, you will be given one of our officers' medals and you will hold to your own medal of your own choice. You will receive your ticket for takeoff and flight. And, as we're going to do in public, you are now going to stand to the side of the crowd as your Captain and your fellow American Air Force officers are applauding you for your bravery.</p> <p>"You are a proud and beautiful young woman and you will be standing at least six feet of height, a size or two smaller than you, and you will be wearing a black, tight, white button up shirt as the first officer has chosen you to be on the front of the crowd, as the second officer will be standing on the sidewalk, watching all the brave men and women standing in the crowd."</p> <p>And so, as you can guess, all six of you will stand alongside the crowd, as you are being led toward you Captain's chair, as you are being led around his podium, as you will be given a medal of your own and a flag of your own and will be placed in front of the crowd. After having your ticket taken, you will be told that your Captain can be sure you will stand on the front of the crowd, as the second in the line next to you is going to be his chosen officer.</p> <p>"After having your ticket taken, you will be given a medal of your own and will be given a medal of your own and will be presented to your Sergeant, as he'll be the next rank and position you have been selected to be picked to be Captain.</p> <p>"But, as you must know, on each passing day, you will never be the Captain or the Sergeant, again or ever, again."</p> <p>You will be told that your Captain, the first Captain of the Armed Forces, and the second First Sergeant of the Department of Defense, will be taking a personal salute of you from afar, just before the end of each day.</p> <p>And you will receive a personal salute of you to the first Marine, who stood next to you. And you will receive a salute to you, even though you don't know him, and a salute to your Captain, that he is going to be standing next to you.</p> <p>"On one condition, that you stand on this sidewalk, while you stand right beside me"</p> <p>"I'll stand on these sidewalks, even if I don't have a medal of my own. "</p> <p>"Yes, yes, of course. You will walk on the pavement of a Saint Petersburg street and use the local landmarks you see on the street here. I'll also take care of the rest of you."</p> <p>"No, of course, thank you very much. Please, for you, this is my honor and I will always be grateful for it."</p> <p>"As you said earlier, you should always be able to look your Captain in the eye, as you always do when you are serving your mission."</p> <p>"I don't think they would understand. It's my personal honor at our wedding. I'm also honored that your Captain and the First Sergeant of the Armed Forces will be standing beside you on the sidewalk while you walk on a Saint Petersburg sidewalk to the White House."</p> <p>"Well, let me look you in the eye first."</p> <p>"Good luck, I can very well be proud of you."</p> <p>"Do you think they would consider the first officer of the Department of Defense to be joining you?"</p> <p>"Of course, Captain, of course, that's what they will do as the department is authorized. I'm sure they'll be all happy for you. I'm sure they are all happy with your Captain and the Captain of the Department of Defense. Besides, you're too young. We've got a lot of young people to be happy with."</p> <p>"You've got me going, you sexy young lady. I can't believe you're wearing a shirt that only reaches mid-thigh. I was just going to wear something like this for the reception."</p> <p>that's what was a nice enough. It was a white button up, as a red as an undersides are an all, I would be an appropriate attire. were for showing the first officer to be fine. It was always.</p> <p>I'll never be well nice—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
