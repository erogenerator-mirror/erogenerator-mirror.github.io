I continue my course by actions according to nature, until I</h4><p><strong>fall and cease, breathing out my last breath into that air, by which continually breathed in I did live; and falling upon that earth, out of whose gifts and fruits</strong> he was made I lived. I lived in this place; the air of the day in which it all took place so that I lived my life for the pleasure, and enjoyment of having a cock which was made, which was made to exist for me. I took pleasure in the enjoyment of being made, having a cock to enjoy, to be pleasure, and to enjoy.</p> <p>And I loved it.</p> <p>I looked to the ground and then leaned my head against the seat of the chair in front of me. I took care not to move. I didn't want to make a sound; in fact I wanted to avoid making sound all the time. And that's when I heard the sound of Mr. Carter's voice. "Oh, you're a real woman, aren't you. I could kiss you forever, wouldn't you know that, sweetie," and I giggled in my throat as the air that had so recently been breathed into me began to become, and then to flow into me. I thought of all my dreams had I been made to love Mr. Carter a few months earlier, that he would have allowed me to have a cock. "You, you, you really are going to love him, aren't you?"</p> <p>"Yes, oh, yes, I do, I do love him," I panted. I took care not to make noise. I didn't want to make a sound. I didn't want to make a sound just to sound. And, yes, I am a woman, I am a woman, and yes, I am a woman because I have a cock, I have a cock, I have a cock that can fuck, I, I have a cock that can fuck, I, I, I, I can fuck. And I love him, I love him with all my soul, as if he was real.</p> <p>I looked up to see Mr. Carter coming down the aisle at me through the tinted windows of the car. He was smiling at me on the way, as was quite apparent, but he couldn't conceal his smile as he looked towards the sky and called me into his hand and kissed me.</p> <p>"You made me want to suck your cock," he whispered while he looked over my shoulder to see me. "And I wanted to make you cum," he added with a smirk. And he kissed my lips with a lustful passion, while he reached over and pulled the top half of my dress out of the way. He looked up to see my breasts and my eyes were sparkling. He looked to look to me and I turned up my eyes, and made a face with an effort to look at him.</p> <p>"Please, sir," I said. "Take me somewhere." I knew that his words would be so loud to some outside who might hear.</p> <p>He smiled down to me. "Come to your destination, sweetie -- we have time, and I can tell you are very excited -- and yes, we don't have time, though you may not remember, I will see you in a few hours, and I will call you, I promise. That is all very important for me to say."</p> <p>"Yes, sir," I answered. I felt that I was just a little bit nervous because he had to have seen me that way, but I was feeling so much better by that point. I felt as if I was in some kind of heaven. I saw his grin and his eyes gleamed with it.</p> <p>He pulled the chair as close to him as possible and he began to unbuckle his pants, as he spoke to me, "It's time to do the work, my sweet," he said with a wink while he pulled his cock out and began to stroke it. "And I don't need the rest, it's time we started having a little fun," he added with another wink. He smiled as he looked forward at me and then he leaned over the edge of the seat to press his lips to mine for a kiss like it had never been kissed before.</p> <p>And I was thrilled by all the things that he had just said that I wanted to do. I kissed, my tongue dancing against his before he pressed his mouth to mine and kissed me deeply. He kissed me with a passion I had never seen in him before, and in the way he was pulling back to look me in the eye, making me smile and make him happy, kissing me again in the way that he had kissed me before so many, many years ago. I was so excited in this moment, as if my life was about to end, and there was nothing that I wouldn't have wanted to do more.</p> <p>And there was no way I had ever been happier and wanted more in my life than what I was now because of this man, in the same, the way that I now was. I was. I needed, and never less than that I was in the way that Iâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
