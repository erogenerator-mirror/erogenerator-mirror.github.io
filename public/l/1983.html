Whatsoever any man either doth or saith, thou must be good; not for</h4><p><strong>any man’s sake, but for thine own nature’s sake; as if either gold, or the emerald, or purple, should ever be saying to themselves, Whatsoever any man either doth or</strong> can do, in any situation or situation or situation, shall be prepared to take, is a man's desire, and not a wish, for his own peace, to have his pleasure.</p> <p>It had seemed strange when I was so close so close to her, like my cock, it felt as though it had been in her mouth, or her pussy, but somehow the sensation of being close as we were was the most wonderful of sexual acts. So close, in fact that I could feel it in my balls, so near, that I could even feel the heat of her body, and that sent shivers up my spine. With the touch of her lips, so close, in fact, that I had never been even a little afraid that I would shoot my sperm onto her, or in her.</p> <p>And so it was. But that pleasure wasn't just that. It was her hands, hands that were just the lightest at first. As if she were reading the meaning of my thoughts, "Whatsoever you may find there on these walls is the touch of this woman, and not just for which she herself hath made herself a part, but for whom she also made herself herself." It was all just so much. In the few seconds that she held my cock, it felt as if they were still her hands and she was stroking me. So many things might seem strange at once: her touching fingers, or her hands caressing my cock; but those moments, though fleeting, seemed to take an eternity.</p> <p>I have mentioned before that my cock had always been on the small side, though she was very much larger than that, but this first touch of her fingers, a caress, or her touch was something that, no doubt, could have been felt anywhere on my body, as if it were on my cock. But it wasn't. It was a gentle caress of her palm, and, if she could feel the hand that she was gripping, as if it was that hand that she was stroking my cock, she might feel the hand that she was caressing my cock. She did, though, move her other palm to, or up, or down, her hand.</p> <p>So, if her palm was a hand, she could feel the contact of her hand. It took the form of it pressing and sliding her palm across a man's cock's head. She could read what was happening.</p> <p>'I have only thought of one man's cock. I was thinking of my own penis when I was just in town, and I thought how it could have been, when it was the man beside me.'</p> <p>But I was the only one. I couldn't be the only one. I couldn't be the only one that had a cock.</p> <p>And, yes I was thinking of it, she was thinking of it! Just like she had thought of it.</p> <p>So, when I felt the touch of her hands, I felt like I might shoot off, I felt like I could have just ejaculated.</p> <p>I was about to, but I couldn't, it was too early for that. She did that. It felt almost mechanical. Like she was simply doing what happened to her hands, or more like doing it to herself. I wanted to, I wanted to cum, but I didn't, I just kept still.</p> <p>After that, I was thinking, with her, I could have, I would have, I couldn't, but I didn't, I just kept still. My cock was still twitching in her hand, and I thought, 'oh, and now, this man, and I, in the midst of my own desire and a lust that I would have never dreamt of ever again, may I have his cock in my hand, and will that I may then have such a thing in my body, as is his desire.'</p> <p>I couldn't help it. I wanted to, but I couldn't, and then she was doing it. It felt like she was touching me down there. Like there was a soft hand that she could do it with, and feel what it might feel like to be touched there.</p> <p>After all, she is as far from me as any man could be, but still, this cock in her hand, and she touched me with her hand, and I felt that as if there were a force at her touch, perhaps even a force that would make me quiver.</p> <p>I didn't know what happened to me that night, and that night I don't know for sure, I was feeling all of my life, all of my life was feeling the feel of her hands that she took me in her palm, the softness of her fingers, and they just were there, touching me. Feeling the pressure and caressing me. It.</p> <p></p> <p>that night, and feeling, and touching, not just touching my cock, or fucking with hands, feel and—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
