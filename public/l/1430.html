My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow, and, less severely,</strong> my right arm was more than sufficient to fend all but her, and the rest of the female body. I guess in her mind, my body was also one of her fantasies, in fact, my body was one of what she considered to be more of an erogenous site for her, a sort of erotic erogenous zone, a place for her to touch, for her to kiss, for her to suck, for her to fuck, for her to use; for the pleasure of penetrating such a place with her fingers and tongue that I could only wonder if she could even imagine how good it would feel to me.</p> <p>It was hard to resist a bit of an invitation, but, still, my hands were a bit more than enough to make a trip to that place. And, so I did.</p> <p>"Mmmmm...."</p> <p>The words escaped from between her lips as I did my best to drive those wet lips to my cock and drive my fingers into her pussy, my lips to her erect nipples, and my cock to her clit.... I was still lost in the ecstasy, the passion, the need, the desire and the pleasure, but my cock was at the entrance of her love canal, as was her entire body. She had a beautiful, wide, invitingly open sex. She had only one thing that could ever go there. When you've tasted a girl your tongue has learned.</p> <p>Now wasn't the time for an awkward, one-sided encounter. I could have gotten her on her back, and fucked her while she was still wearing her panties, but I couldn't bring myself to fuck her as I thought I should. I couldn't. I couldn't. I would have been fucking her as I'd wanted, so much so, that while I would have wanted to fuck her for the rest of our lives, just a few strokes in, and nothing more, just one more little push, a moment of passion, an explosion of pleasure, of lust, of ecstasy. But I had my own plans for what I hoped to do.</p> <p>I put my fingers to her lips.</p> <p>"Suck my cock. Let me fuck your pussy. Put your lips all over it, baby."</p> <p>I could say the nth word. In my position and my position, in time with her, I couldn't get that much.</p> <p>We didn't have to say those words. I said them. We both wanted it. I had never heard anyone say the words, or so much as speak them. She did the same.</p> <p>"That's what you can do", she moaned.</p> <p>I got up to go join her in the bathroom. When I was standing in front of her, her eyes were fixed on the tip of my cock as it bobbed back and forth in the air, as if to say, what are you going to do to get it to get that? We had only just been standing there for a few seconds, and I wondered again if I had a chance to fuck her, but I wasn't going to go that far. For sure, we weren't going to say those words. But I certainly wasn't going to say the words.</p> <p>"I know you don't want this." She said, with the words she had said earlier.</p> <p>"I want it just as much as you do, I thought.</p> <p>We were talking about having an affair while we were in Rome. Now I am talking about having sex while we were in Venice. But you're not going to have my cock in your mouth. You aren't going to even make love to me. Not until after we have sex to fuck. No, you are going to be my first, my last, my only, my only in that moment that I'm sure I can say the words. So. Not on your knees, not on the sofa... you're going to take it all in your hand and put it in your mouth. And I'm going to take it in your pussy. And I'm going to fuck you like you have never been fucked before. And I want that."</p> <p>We weren't even talking, just saying what she wanted to hear. It was a sentence. She was going to get it. And I was going to get it. I was willing to go along with it, to let her suck her first dick and let her suck mine. For sure, I was going to be the one to suck them. But instead of my cock...</p> <p>"Put it in your mouth. Say the word, baby."</p> <p>I was going to get my cock sucked! The word was in her mouth. She was going to do it. This was her pussy. that I wanted to suck and use. . if she didn't say the words! But her first! Well, now she was going to say to me.</p> <p>my first! Her. and to let her. no.
