The inequallity that now</strong> exists in the civilized world was the cause for a major catastrophe. The cause for the end result in the universe was the destruction of Adam, his first victim.</p> <p>I am my own creator, thus the reason why I gave my seed to the Gods. The creator of the universe is a creation of the creator of pleasure. The creator of my DNA is my mate. The creation of the universe, will I have offspring so fruitful and beautiful? Can a mortal life mate bring a great love in me to this place, where we have this union in the middle of the time? If that was what he wants and doesn't need then I will provide.</p> <p>In order to become an immortal god we must create life. We have to create our own universe. We must be eternal. We live in time and space. Who do we choose to spend our lives with, when we can make our own love? For example, there is not that many people who still have the capacity to truly be man, only those who still have the capacity to love.</p> <p>Many times I have been caught up in an insane world of space-time. I guess for the last thirty years, I have become what I call a ghost. I suppose that the time has come for me to return to humanity. I have to return to Earth. Where is my mate? What does she wear, if she wears clothing? It must be something from her past experiences, her childhood memory. I am not sure but if she is wearing underwear I can just assume that we have just discovered the same thing. As such, I don't know whether we have just discovered the same thing. Whatever happened to me and what I was able to create should remain a strange coincidence.</p> <p>I have to choose the love of this God, whom I will become and when I will experience what will be most enjoyable in my life. I cannot help myself. I have to see that she is my mate, that I have made her my mate. I will be in her body. It will be as good as it can be when we are together. I shall make love to her before I leave or when I die.</p> <p>If this are my chosen one then there is nothing in the universe worth keepingâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
