The Sperm Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.</h4><p><strong>Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us join them, and lay together our own. Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and</strong> the Great White Shark can be the only two animals in the world who can mate. But, I digress. We've seen their mating habits. How they are getting to be so special, is beyond me. In a short time, the Great White Shark and the Great White Shark have made all three of the great whales his and the Great White Shark our food, our drinks, and our food. Let us look at our food before we eat it. The best way is to wait, while we savour our food. And it's always a pleasure to taste the delights of the human female with their male's tongue. The only difference is that the male will only give special pleasure.</p> <p>"The Great White Shark is my mate."</p> <p>"I'm honoured to be called your mate."</p> <p>"The Great White Shark is my mate."</p> <p>"I'm glad to be your mate."</p> <p>They were kissing each other, but the water had changed. It was like when we first lay with our heads touching. Then, as now, we kissed, and tasted each other's mouth. I loved the taste of him for he was salty and sour, and my tongue was getting wet. The first time we kissed, it was like that too. Our tongues were dancing and rubbing together when I felt his hand begin to caress my breasts. He was rubbing my right breast, and I was moaning his name. He sucked my nipple that I had not seen since puberty. He then moved his head back from them, and kissed my other breast. He licked all around my nipple, making me feel pleasure and pleasure, and feeling desire. I felt myself getting wet. With his hand now caressing me, his mouth kissing my other breast; I started to get wet with desire for him. He started to kiss his way down my abdomen and navel, where I was becoming very horny.</p> <p>"What are we waiting for?" "Why wait?" "Let's make this feel special."</p> <p>I opened my legs and felt his tongue on my clit. My legs shook as he made me become very horny, and in anticipation of the pleasures he was going to give me. With a quick flick of his tongue to make me come, and my own feeling of pleasure, he stopped when my thighs were shaking as though I had reached the limit of pleasure.</p> <p>"What's wrong?"</p> <p>"It's too powerful, what if I don't come?"</p> <p>"What is it you don't like, you don't think that our life is worth living?"</p> <p>"That's it, it's not what I like at all."</p> <p>"Don't you want to taste it?"</p> <p>"I don't know."</p> <p>With my head held by his lips kissing me, his hand playing with my hair, and me sucking on his cock, I didn't know what to make of it. I had not felt the pleasure of another man's lips touching my pussy. It had been a short time in making love with another woman, but now it was different. It was not the sweet taste that I remembered. It was the different feeling of it. When he was touching my, I could feel my orgasm start to build up. He stopped when I had my second orgasm, and licked me with all the feelings he was giving me.</p> <p>"I'm going to suck you until you come."</p> <p>I then felt his tongue licking my pussy. It sent waves of love and love in my mind. I got more horny by the second. As I was thinking these words, my husband came to my side and started kissing my stomach. When his lips and tongue went on my belly, I felt more pleasure than I had felt before.</p> <p>When he reached my pubic hair, he pushed his face into my body with his hand and started kissing my vagina. As I felt his tongue searching the space between her clitoris, my husband took my labia in his lips and started to suck. In no time, I was approaching another orgasm.</p> <p>When I felt that his tongue was in me, licking my clitoris, he stopped.</p> <p>"Wait a minute, it's not that, it's better just to have it inside."</p> <p>While his mouth was on my clitoris, his cock had made its way into me after having been in my vagina. I got a thrill, feeling it going in me. It was different as his manhood was inside. It felt different, like he was a big man. I moved my clitoris and felt pleasure from the touch of his cock all the way. I looked at his penis which seemed to be making a hole in water. I thought of having it inside me. It felt a bigger. I felt as though it was the same as he had made his tongue. He was going faster and faster, and deeper, and bigger. He kept moving. It felt like there was more exciting. It felt so—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
