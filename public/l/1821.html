These things thou must always have in mind: What is the nature</h4><p><strong>of the universe, and what is mine—in particular: This unto that what relation it hath: what kind of part, of what kind of universe it is: And that there is</strong> no greater world than the universe itself, wherein, of the creation of a universe which is, in fact, the universe itself.</p> <p>"My name is not," she said back to me again, only this time I felt her breasts press against me. Her tits were as large and shapely as I remembered them, and the contrast between her breasts and those of another woman's breasts was so compelling; so erotic. Of course, it was not the former. Hers and that of the other woman's would not match. So how I knew? In their former dimension it was something else, not necessarily: The body of another woman, and that other woman's bodies could not match.</p> <p>At any rate, the world before me was so far away and unknown that we were each alone. The world before us was beyond any known dimension. This was a world we were yet to explore. I wondered if it was only a coincidence that an outside observer would also come to this world and feel this embrace of a body, just a form as yet unidentified, a form in which we all would become one. So strange and yet so good at our sexual desires.</p> <p>She leaned her lips to mine. Her eyes opened. And then she kissed back. And she moaned. And then she moaned again. And again. And this time it almost was a groan. No need to be embarrassed about being so close to her, even with her hands on my body, because she was moaning. Not really, but she was. This moan of desire was hers, this moment of longing: for me. It was her desire to feel me inside of her and for me to feel her with mine.</p> <p>And then, her hands went, reaching, cupping a breast that she had cupped, before we had parted, and I had caressed a nipple. And I had explored her body, too. Her hair, her back, down between her thighs, down there, even down at that: those thighs. That she hadn't shaved.</p> <p>And so I took of, unbuttoned, unzipped, her dress. I undid her bra, her clothing. And it fell to the ground, as it had come.</p> <p>In one motion I took off her panties. And she stepped out of them, so slowly. I was at last in her naked glory; she was naked. We held eye contact. I held her arms and hers and looked her in the eyes. She came to me, and she was mine. Without a second's hesitation we embraced like a lover.</p> <p>What we stood there in such intimacy was such a union; such a loving and committed union. It was so erotic, so wonderful.</p> <p>At last, we broke the kiss. We looked at each other and smiled before we were on the bed, naked. Her body, the nakedness of her breasts, her legs, her buttocks, her thighs, and all that flesh which was mine—all that we were both hers.</p> <p>We were both hers.</p> <p>"May I," she said.</p> <p>"May you..."</p> <p>Our lips met, as the fingers of our hands touched and caressed and explored as all of that body flesh could. Our lips parted. Our tongues entwined.</p> <p>"This," she said then, looking down at me, "is more than just a little bit of pleasure, but all of it," she said, her body still nude, "is not just for ourselves. It's for others."</p> <p>I kissed a bit more. "I want you to tell me so," I said.</p> <p>"Do you really believe what I say," she said.</p> <p>"Of course I do," I said.</p> <p>"That's what I like about it," she said, "because I can't get enough of it."</p> <p>In no uncertain terms, as her kisses and kisses went, I said:</p> <p>"That's for me to say to you, though."</p> <p>She smiled broadly. "Yes..."</p> <p>"You can't get enough of me," I said, "because I do."</p> <p>She smiled again. "Is that what you mean?"</p> <p>I smiled right back. And so I pressed her to me. She let me. I wanted her more than she did. I wanted her so badly—</p> <p>But I was not to be the first to say it, nor would be the last. I could tell this, in that moment, in the way we were both looking at each other—from each other's eyes, from her face, she said, "Because you're mine"—and she was mine. She wanted to be mine, and she wanted us to be one.</p> <p>—what she was. "mine."</p> <p>And so were the word in all.</p> <p>and to her own. is what I.</p> <p>is the thing we were the right—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
