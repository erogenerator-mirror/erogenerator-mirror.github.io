The Evening of the Betrothal</h4><p><strong>Villefort had, as we have said, hastened back to Madame de Saint-Méran’s in the Place du Grand Cours, and on entering the house found that the guests whom he had</strong> been accompanying had been a couple of younger men. He found us, of course, equally shocked. And he made a point of not looking at himself in the mirror. “Darling,” he murmured to me, “Look at me like that!” It was then that I noticed what I was wearing, although it took several minutes for me to recognize, even though it had a matching one-piece swimsuit on underneath. I told him that I thought he looked lovely, which he said he did, as if I hadn’t said anything of the sort. He took out his phone and video camera and took my picture – first in the background, then just on the background.</p> <p>A big smile had appeared on his face, and he said, “You are lovely. I am delighted that we can find a happy couple like us and enjoy all the things we have found so worth it!” We all smiled at this and he led me to the bedroom where he stripped down as well, as if we were taking an opportunity to be alone.</p> <p>Villefort then told me to lay on the bed, still with my eyes closed, a little shocked.</p> <p>His cock was standing tall and tall, and a few minutes later, with his right hand still on the shaft, he began to apply the ointment to the tip of it, and as he did so, he inserted his own finger into the bottom of my anus. I was still very apprehensive about this whole thing, but I could hardly prevent him from going further.</p> <p>“Please don’t be alarmed,” he whispered, “you are much more natural than that. I just wish to experience it a little and I hope I can come a little quicker when I do.”</p> <p>“Oh, I don’t think I can manage that!” I answered, trying with considerable difficulty to keep my voice as low as I could.</p> <p>Villefort applied more of the ointment to my anus, and after three strokes, another in, he had put the tip of a carrot in my anus, pressing it between my buttocks. The feel of that carrot against my anus felt quite good, and for a brief moment I was worried that the sensation of that carrot inside my anus was making me want to pee but with that carrot inside my anus, it came down to my pleasure.</p> <p>After three more strokes, I suddenly felt my anus being penetrated – and a little discomfort!</p> <p>Villefort told me that, though he wasn’t at first concerned, he did indeed expect, I might well have an erection for days after all and he decided that if my anus was sore by the time the carrot had slid in, he would keep it there until he got bored of it, because he might have the most pleasant erection of the entire day. And he might well be doing that right away, so that I didn’t have to worry about having to wait for it.</p> <p>Instead, he asked me if I wanted to feel his erection inside my anus, which again puzzled me for a short time. I decided that it was time for me to be open to the idea, and, therefore, so that I got on the bed and felt both my anus and my cock inside the warm embrace of that carrot. Indeed, after having made the first insertion, I felt more of my rectum being penetrated than on my own fingers, although the feel of his hard shaft filling me – rather than in my bottom – was very pleasant indeed.</p> <p>So, when Villefort started to push his cock inside my anus, I felt a sharp slap against my buttocks. Then, to add to the stimulation, I felt, rather than heard, a slap on my own bottom, as though something was being done to me by a man! The pain of a man penetrating my rectum was so pleasant, that only served to heighten my feelings of pleasure, and I soon felt that there were feelings of pleasure as well, as that carrot was sliding in and out of my anus.</p> <p>After a couple of more strokes inside my anus, Villefort said, “Villefort, if you’d like to come, perhaps I could get you to lie down and lie between me and a pillow. Let’s put one in your mouth so that you don’t choke on it."</p> <p>I had no idea what he meant, and I could hardly breathe, as the pain of his cock inside me was almost more than I could bear, but I did as Villefort asked. And I let him get on the pillow between my legs so that I could eat his mouth. His arse, which was almost as nice as mine was, too. He told me to spread my bottom how much of his tongue, how much of my bottom and back passage by opening, how much of it—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
