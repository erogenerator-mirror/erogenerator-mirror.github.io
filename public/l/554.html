It was about eleven o’clock.</strong> He was about to head to bed. He had to. It was time to have a change of pace to enjoy his life. He took another look at the clock. Seven thirty one and to fuck, a change of pace and fuck at all its own. He got up, took a sip of orange juice and headed to bed.</p> <p>His head started spinning. His brain was still functioning. A man can always tell when the first hit of his punch has passed it’s marks, albeit absent in a few areas – his vision, yes, but the rest of him was functioning – so this was more of a man walking beside a woman and going through the motions of making love rather than trying to get an erection. What did that mean to him in that particular regard? He might have thought that about his own wife and daughter. Or that that was another man trying to get a boner with his wife. Or, at another time, a real man trying to get something more to his wife.</p> <p>His mind was now back to his job. His head was so confused, so mixed, that he almost fell asleep. He had no idea what he was doing. He had no idea who he was touching. For the first time in his life, he was touching his cock. Not him. He was touching his cock. He had no idea how he was touching his cock. But, yes, there was an awareness, a feeling that was so strong and so much more than just an instinctual reaction to the moment when he knew what he was trying to accomplish. He might be making a move. He might be feeling the need.</p> <p>And even if his conscience thought it should be some sort of subconscious command, he was still feeling rather good about himself. He hadn’t yet seen his wife. Maybe tonight would be about what the future would be and what he was looking forward to. He couldn’t sleep either. He had to do something. And then, he had to make sure that it actually happened. He decided that, in his book (and at least in his opinion it has) he would make a big effort today to find out.</p> <p>He slowly stroked his cock with his left hand and started thinking about what was to come next. The man from the bar was waiting for him at the table he was sitting at. He felt very comfortable with the man, the person in his arms. And, yes, in his opinion, he was really going to make himself quite comfortable. He was going to make the biggest impression that he had ever made on his body. As this man talked and laughed with him, he had very, very much the man in his arms.</p> <p>The man took his hand and placed it right over his cock, his own hand on the cock, his own hands on the hand, and started caressing his balls with his right hand. The man’s cock was standing as straight as he, as tall as it ever was. In fact, he had a couple inches and width to give it. There was another man to his right with a slight more on it and a couple inches on his own cock. And the man had one of the largest and most defined erections that had ever been seen in all of his fantasies. It would have felt very good if it was as big as it was – if it would be as powerful.</p> <p>The man took his left hand and placed it right on the right breast of the man sitting next to him, and began stroking his nipples, squeezing them lightly in his fingers. The first man to do that to him had his cock, a very impressive one, hanging quite a bit between his fingers.</p> <p>The man was looking at his cock, his head back, his hands on his own cock. So much different than most men. And he, the man, was feeling very much the same. He was stroking his cock. He was feeling a strong urge to reach out and touch it. Of course, there are other men who can masturbate. No one has ever masturbated. So, no one has ever had the pleasure of doing the same to himself. And, yes, this one was definitely not the man who was stroking it. This was a man.</p> <p>He put his fist around the end of his cock and brought it up against the cock at which he was standing up. The man didn’t move his leg, he just took his cock in his left hand and started stroking himself with the hand that was stroking him. He started making long and slow circular strokes up and around the cock at which he was standing up. He closed his eyes and was doing this a lot of things and his way. He was being so close to the cock. And this man.</p> <p></p> <p>He had always took the entire length of the shaft in his hands, he had the entire arm up to the head of his cock, on his cock to his—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
