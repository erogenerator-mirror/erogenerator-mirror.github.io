Nothing was ready for the war that everyone expected and to</strong> say so had been for nothing. Russia's war was just about to begin.</p> <p>We had arrived at Vílna’s home town, on our way, to take shelter there. Our company was preparing for a night out on the town with no real intentions to give any of the other cities a chance. The town itself was situated on the east side of the town center and had no particular destination. All people were gathered here, on a beach off in the middle of the town. After surveying the area for a few minutes I spotted an easy-going nature charm.</p> <p>The town had a few things in common: it smelled sweet, there were people walking the shore, and no one else in the town was out. I was about to head back toward my car to pick up the necessary goods for the trip. The only thing we had to find was a local road, which went the rest of the way.</p> <p>“Come and feel the sun again,” I told him when I finally found his car.</p> <p>To my surprise he seemed pleased to hear me, even though he had been driving for over three hours in the afternoon. I got out of his car to go visit the hotel to make sure everything was packed and ready to go. He insisted on leaving our car parked there and I insisted on buying my own. To this day I cannot believe I had that many items to wear. We were staying in a hotel, a local one. So we decided to go and take all the usual tourist places and check out of the hotel and go to an adult sex shop there where we could buy our first real cock and pussy toys.</p> <p>This was a first. A night out, after we had all arrived, in a place where you could do anything. In truth, when we were ready to fuck we had talked about the risk of being arrested or arrested by some police in our town. Being able to do anything like that would make a great time, I thought. But first we had to take some precautions, to make sure everyone was safe. We needed to be careful, I was certain of that, although I was sure of my own safety.</p> <p>We also knew what we could buy. I found it at a local bookstore we were at. I bought five lubes and some other things to use them, two of them were the sizes I had bought for our first time on the beach in Vé. It was a new found item in me to buy some of this new stuff. In case you were wondering, I bought these to keep our money in Vé when we had already spent over fifty years.</p> <p>The one thing that I did buy the first time we were here was an adult sex toy that looked like one of those rubber looking vibrators that can be a real sex toy or something that you like to insert, then insert it in you or any place you like, just to be sure. I didn't want to buy it.</p> <p>“If you will, put this on,” I said handing him one of the little plastic items.</p> <p>When I took off my shirt and shorts the next thing I knew I was wearing a strap on dildo. The thing only had one purpose in mind. We were going to go to a sex shop to purchase some of the things we would be wanting to buy today. I don't think I had ever even put any of my items in a store until the evening. I couldn't believe I was taking my clothes off in a bookstore. The way our life was going I thought it would be nice to go in there, get the real thing out here.</p> <p>In the sex shop, a young lady came in and put me on the vibrator, not one of those big ones, but the one with the ridged tip attached and the smaller one inserted inside of me. It looked like it had come out of the body of a dog but not a dog. After inserting the dildo with a few quick pushes the woman put the smaller one in me and buckled the straps around my waist. We were back at the hotel, the next afternoon.</p> <p>A few minutes after we got there all the lights were off and we couldn't see what was going on. I had never been with a woman before and the moment I looked at the face of a woman with a sex appeal that I found irresistible. My own personal porno had to sell more than mine. I had not experienced a sexier woman in my life. When I did get a chance to see one of these things in the bookstore the difference was very slight. Instead I started on the bed, sat on the end, with the dildo inside of the dildo and started it inside of the vibrating thing. I was like a long and in me, pushing in. Soon after that thing and pushing and pushing and pushing and push as I was a little movements—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
