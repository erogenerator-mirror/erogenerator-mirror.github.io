The Whiteness of the Whale.</h4><p><strong>What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he was to me, as yet remains unsaid. Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick,</strong> we can always return to the topic; the day is upon.</p> <p>"Ahaba," I spoke, "You might be late..."</p> <p>"I am not late," she said, "By the way, do you remember your name?"</p> <p>I nodded my head. In a flash, I was on her. First I kissed her and now I wanted to kiss her as much as any lover can. Her hands began playing with my hair as I pushed her onto the bed. As I kissed her, I reached down to caress her breasts through her bra. Her hands made me feel so wonderfully naughty. I did not know if I had time or not. I pulled her bra up, over her breasts, and pulled her bra off. Her breasts were gorgeous, as I knew it from the first night I saw them. Her bra was so sexy. I kissed her nipples with my tongue as she moaned. Her hands came to my hair, pressing it into my scalp. I pulled her onto the bed further so I could kiss her face. I kissed my way down her neck and then to her breasts before she could protest my head move again. Her nipples were like little pebbles and she moaned. Taking her right breast into my mouth, I sucked it firmly while my tongue continued at the same rhythm, making it hard as a rock. As I kissed her breasts, my fingers took the other breast, squeezing it in a way only she could ever feel. It was different to the bra, but it had the same effect. With little movements of my hand, I squeezed and kneaded her breasts with her in my mouth and on her nipples. With little motions of my hand, I sucked the whole breast into my mouth, holding her there.</p> <p>Holly began to moan and her hips began undulating in the way only an older woman can ever be before. I switched tits and sucked on her left, continuing the same motion till my tongue was at her right. I sucked the nipple before slowly rolling it between my teeth, pulling it with my lips and pulling the nipple with my tongue. Her moaning, my kissing, her fingers, on my face, and on her tits as she was making and feeling so good, made what I was doing to my lover that much easier.</p> <p>Her hands came back to mine; I did not stop for her breasts. She pulled me to her, pressing us against each other for more of a kiss.</p> <p>"Now I'm going to give you something special," she said, holding my face a little closer. "We're going to make love. For the first time in a long time, we are going to make love."</p> <p>I nodded.</p> <p>She put her hands on my backside and pulled me onto mine, moving to kneel between my knees. I could see what she was in front of me and my heart gave a little jump. She moved her hands to her own breast and cupped one of them, giving it another good suck. She moved to get better contact with my other breast, as her left hand moved to my back again. Again she moved to get in to me and again I let her. We came together, as many times I could count until it was time before either of us had stopped.</p> <p>"I've never, never felt two lovers," was all I said.</p> <p>"I hope you've never felt your lover's breasts," she said. "My breasts are special to you, not too many others, but yours are special to me. What about yours?"</p> <p>"If one lover has a breast, you know what I mean. I just know that someone else has also been in the same position and can give that pleasure that your mouth gave me. I know what you've experienced as my breast-lover."</p> <p>She had kissed my mouth again. Her tongue was so wonderful and her lips were so sweet. With her hands on my breasts, we kissed as if we were lovers. She was caressing my left nipple. I was holding her in my hands, wanting to hold her and touch her. With some movement of our hands, I was rolling her nipple between my thumbs and forefingers while my kisses were on her right breast. It felt so soft and yet so firm and full, the way my lovers do. It made my nipples so stiff that they were touching her skin in a very pleasurable way.</p> <p>We were having an incredible time, all the while, making love. Her breasts were not only mine but also mine to touch. Not only did they feel wonderful, they felt wonderful to kiss and kiss. I had never felt so much pleasure as I had with Holly's breasts.</p> <p>-lovemaking-my-self.</p> <p>so-like-being-without-one,</p> <p>with-the-my-one she if-having-without me. our own. have I. make-without-myâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
