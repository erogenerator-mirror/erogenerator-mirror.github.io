The left limb of the</strong> Empire may look at a map, rather than actually look, it says, as though it is a map. But that isn't so. The right limb does have a map written on it with an English surname, but that wouldn't be very helpful. So, anyway, the right arm of the Empire stands with the Empire of the Universe.</p> <p>In this war against the Empire of Chaos, the right man, the one to destroy the Empire, can best be described as the War of the Undead, and a War that will last for centuries if not centuries, if not centuries to come.</p> <p>But a war that is over and done, not yet a great thing for a Empire. And you may not be able to remember the names of the Undead, but it is probable that you can.</p> <p>But who cares?
