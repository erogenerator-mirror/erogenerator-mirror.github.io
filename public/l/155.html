Darkness</h4><p><strong>Sydney Carton paused in the street, not quite decided where to go. “At Tellson’s banking-house at nine,” he said, with a musing face. “Shall I do well, in the mean</strong> time that we might find it in our good graces?”</p> <p>She didn’t reply but we both knew she would. She was so different to the other men and this one was the result. I pulled up her shirt and undid her bra, lifting her breasts gently in my hands as I pulled her to me with my lips, my tongue searching for her hardening nipples, teasing them before sucking on them, tasting them and gently biting them. “Oooh,” she moaned softly, her body quivering deliciously. My own arousal was soaring now as I stood up to help her, my erection now hard and throbbing from having been given the opportunity by a strange, beautiful woman.</p> <p>She pushed me down, pushing me away from her body so my dick would never leave. I reached down, pulling her panties off with my left hand and she lifted herself onto her legs so that her pussy was exposed. I stepped up to her and lifted her leg over one of mine, pressing it against my belly. I looked at the swollen nub of her clit between her legs, watching as it peeked proudly from under the hood, swollen and pouting, waiting to be licked. She gasped when I pressed forward again so that our skin touched and the tip of head of my cock slid into her.</p> <p>“What’s this?” she asked, looking as if she were asking for permission. “Are you sure you want me?”</p> <p>My answer was to press my cock hard through the gap in the wetness of her pussy. She shuddered at the touch, her body jerking when I touched the tip of my cock to her clit. “Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, just like that.”</p> <p>She reached down, moving her cunt up and down, up and down my manhood as I pressed deeper with each stroke, the head of my cock sliding over her engorged lips. My hands moved up to support her weight as she bounced a little up and down. My cock was sliding in and out of her well lubricated pussy as her body moved in the same rhythm, the sensation almost too much for me to bear. She was so warm and tight, her muscles massaging my cock with heat and wetness. It was so much more than I could have imagined.</p> <p>I was losing control, my hand trembling as my hips started to rock against her, the sensation too much to bear. I felt my sperm rising and knew I wanted to shoot off as soon as possible. “Yes, please don’t stop. Please don’t stop.”</p> <p>“I'm sorry but don’t.” Was she really sorry that she had been the one that had been doing the telling – that I had told her so much about it – that we had to be doing things.</p> <p>That was all it took. I started to shoot, hard, grunting and groaning as I felt my hot seed filling her pussy and spreading down her inner thighs. Her own orgasm ripped through her body, her fingers flying along my back as my hands held her firmly in place. I collapsed atop her as we both gasped for breath, my weight pressing our bodies against her as the muscles of her vagina squeezed my cock as it lay still inside her.</p> <p>I opened my eyes for a moment and saw her eyes staring at me, her brow knitted in concentration as she panted after her own spasms. She smiled up at me with an expression of satisfaction and she kissed me softly. My own hand found her thigh, rubbing the soft flesh of her inner thigh as I squeezed the firm cheek of her ass with my other hand.</p> <p>We lay there for a long while, her head resting on my shoulder, her breathing gradually returning to normal, her skin still wet with sweat and our mingled secretions. I looked down at my penis, still buried deep inside her and saw the wet stain of our mixed juices on my thigh. I smiled to myself and felt my mouth suddenly dry. I could still taste us on both our lips and the saltiness of our breath and the scent of our lovemaking.</p> <p>We got to our feet, still naked but both of us with some difficulty. I held Sydney to me and kissed her cheek again, her neck and earlobes. She leaned her head back onto mine, her eyes still closed as I moved my kisses along her neck. There were tears now falling onto the tops of her breasts as they pressed against me. I felt her move against me in the next moment.</p> <p>She moved her leg up and placed it over mine, her hand moving down between my legs to grab my stomach. She pulled her own legs and gently caressing her body against us both together, her pussy and our crooning me.
