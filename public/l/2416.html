This book is dedicated to the two great philosophers, Thomas Aquinas and Kant, who founded their philosophy, and are now the founders of Kant and its philosophy of deductive reason. Thomas Aquinas teaches Kant, Kantism, Reason, Theology, the Ethics of Reason, and Scientific Method.</p> <p>The end of Kantism and its philosophy of deductive reasoning.</p> <p>© 2006 by E. E.

Not the first draft, but with a lot of editing (and a lot of re-writing too!), so the future of it can be much improved.</p> <p>So I'll get out there and explain things in a minute. Sorry I can't do much but do a little research to get a better start into the future. Anyway, I hope readers enjoy these stories.</p> <p>I'll continue the story in a day or two, but for now, some of the rest will be in the beginning. A reminder from a fellow, "What would happen, if I didn't?"</p> <p>AUTHOR'S NOTE: For my own sake, it will be best to leave it as is, rather than re-hash it, especially given that it has just been edited from within. In fact, it's best to delete it without re-hash it, like I did with 'The Day a Lady goes home,' and 'Why did she do it?' so I'll save that one.</p> <p>The best part is this time in history, where I can do some research. I will write in the early years and hope you enjoy!</p> <p>Special thanks to my fellow Literotica authors, who inspired me in my new endeavor. They can be useful!</p> <p>--—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
