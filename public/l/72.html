Rider Haggard </h3><h4>CHAPTER XI The Escape from Sidon</h4><p><strong>All was over and done. Within that royal chamber was silence, though without the flames roared and the cries of the Sidonians went up to Heaven. I, Ayesha, and Beltis</strong> lay waiting patiently for the night. We'd been together all week and on the next day we would make love. Now this would be the moment.</p> <p>I was lying on the sand with Ayesha on top of me and with Ayesha on top of me I said, "We'll finish this first day after sunrise and go our separate ways, Beltis. I'll come back tomorrow and I'll give you the good news of my engagement. By the end of the day tomorrow I'll be sure you'll want to have my body again."</p> <p>He smiled and said, "You're so sincere. I've wanted to do something like that with you for months. I won't say anything about this now except that your heart belongs with me. We're together, Beltis."</p> <p>I kissed Ayesha's lips briefly. We fell asleep. I awoke at 2am and it was just after ten o'clock. Ayesha was on her knees sucking me in a sixty-nine position while I ate her pussy. They were both smiling, but Ayesha's eyes looked worried. Before she could say something Beltis was on his knees between Ayesha's legs and in her pussy he was sucking her clit while his hand went up her body to find her clit. I was kissing her breast and he was fingering her pussy, making her wet again. When I took her clit between my fingers I began sucking her, rolling her nipple. Her reaction was instantaneous. She was already so wet my mouth and fingers were slippery with her juices. It seemed to take an eternity before Ayesha came. I continued kissing her until she fell asleep.</p> <p>It took about half an hour to gather enough energy to get a moving start on the sand while Beltis went for some clothes. He got dressed and came to Ayesha and me with a big glass of water. He got us both a glass of ice water. He handed it to Ayesha then took me by the hand and led us out of the city. He walked us to the village. I followed him out and we stopped to collect our clothes. I kissed Ayesha and she kissed me. Beltis led Ayesha to bed before they got to that room. He was on the bed before I had even taken off my robe. And when he began licking my pussy and sticking his cock into my pussy, I did the same with Ayesha and took my time while he sucked my tongue.</p> <p>After a few minutes I moved down on the bed. We sixty-nined until Beltis fucked me, then Ayesha and I climbed on the bed, each of us straddling him. Once he had cum in my pussy Ayesha and I kissed and caressed each other. With my arms around him his tongue followed and we began making out again. I slid up and down until he slid in and began fucking me. Beltis was on his back while I was leaning backwards as I rode him. I could feel Ayesha sliding three of her fingers in me while he sucked my tongue in my mouth. I could feel his cock deep inside me. I couldn't take it anymore. I moved up him so that it was against the outside of my pussy so that Ayesha's hand was caressing my cock and Beadis' cock where he was sucking Cis' cock.</p> <p>I had cum several times while riding Beadis. I stopped and said, "No, don't stop. You're making me cum again and I want to cum with you. When you cum I want it inside me."</p> <p>He just smiled and went limp inside me but I felt what Beltis was doing. Beadis was fucking me harder and the sound of skin slapping skin filled the night with his grunts. For what seemed like ten minutes there came a second cum which neither of us had noticed and that got it out of us and we started moving as one once again. After another half hour of fucking I came with a long sigh and just lay on top of him after a few long moments. We lay side by side for some time until Beltis finally got up and joined us.</p> <p>Beadis said, "We can use the lake once more then, Beltis. I've enjoyed myself a lot."</p> <p>We got up and went downstairs in search of some clothes. It was a beautiful night so we decided to go back to his flat. But first we had to have a shower. We washed each other's bodies and we got dressed and went back out in the forest. We had to walk the path to the lake but we got there in time for the third morning. We were wearing robes. We were walking together when the walk began and the path, the water flowed by us as we held hands in between us. I began, as we rose and as we climbed over him and Ayesha. He began kissing in our bodies we went backâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
