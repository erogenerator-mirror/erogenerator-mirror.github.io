At headquarters and among the troops near by the news spread that</strong> they were to go after the emperor, the Colonel spoke.</p> <p>"They just decided to make a raid," Colonel Winky, General Chaplain in command of the troops, said. "Why not make a huge raid on the emperor?"</p> <p>"Because we just had to get some of the soldiers away from our territory, or their families, and leave an heir on their way to the palace. You wouldn't have anyone in your kingdom, and you would not have many men here to raise."</p> <p>"Yes, but, but, but, I guess I'd start to think that you might want to go."</p> <p>"Maybe," Chantal said, "but, maybe not," then she added, "I mean, as a matter of fact, perhaps we should make sure that you don't go."</p> <p>Chantal left them, and the Captain of the Army had orders to stay the course, and just be cautious.</p> <p>*</p> <p>"What have you done, Colonel?"</p> <p>"Don't know," Chaplain said.</p> <p>It was the first time Chaplain had had a man for an assignment. There were several important meetings like this during which she had been assigned for a major conference. And her husband was a diplomat, and she hated being a woman herself. But this was all so new and exciting and exciting about it. And to have someone there for her so personally that she just became a woman, just seemed so very natural. This was so much like this old man she was being brought-in-the-country. She could not believe that she had even considered the idea, and she suddenly thought that maybe.</p> <p>The meeting of the army officer's battalion of officers was conducted in the name of Sergeant Rafferty, and Chaplain had no clue of his position in command but was hoping that she would be assigned to his battalion of officers.</p> <p>He was a large officer, and had to be a large officer as well. He was the tallest officer on the platoon, and stood over six feet seven. Chaplain imagined him in his uniform, and that's when he was standing on his two foot broad. It was so incredibly erotic. Chaplain loved the way that she could see the bulge of his bulge when he walked that man's body. The sight of the man's naked erect cock and the bulge of the soldier in the middle, was mesmerizing.</p> <p>A man and a woman sitting near Chaplain sat on either side of him, with a woman sitting on the man's right and the man on the left. Chaplain's eyes were on the soldier as the man stroked the soldier's cock that was fully erect again, and she couldn't tell the man's man's cock from the thin fabric, as she had noticed with the soldier's cock.</p> <p>The soldier was tall, and when Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha. Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha She looked over Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha.</p> <p>And with their uniforms revealing everything about the uniform, Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Chantal said, "I have to meet someone, now."</p> <p>A big, hairy man in his fifties stood up, looked the uniform of Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha</p> <p></p> <p>Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha Chaâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
