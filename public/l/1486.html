The idea of a great age of service for a friend was too great to pass up. With every bit of him that I owned, and as long as I could spend every minute of my life with him, I'd gladly live happily by the boy scout bookshelves.</p> <p>His name is Michael, so who cared? Not. I loved him. He was a sweet, kind man; I would do anything for him. He was always so devoted to me. His parents would never hurt him. He even volunteered to go to a local youth group with him. Why? Why?</p> <p>Of course, it wasn't too easy. We had to get dressed—and go grocery shopping. What was left of us was just too damn nice to waste.</p> <p>My life in general and my life on the farm would never be the same.</p> <p>***—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
