Bounce that cock in me. Let me feel you cumming all over me. Fuck me Tommy, fuck me, fuck, fuck, I love feeling your cock in my ass!"</p> <p>I took my right hand off my ass to let his cock free of its confines.</p> <p>"You have no idea how much I love the sound of it being out of my ass. It's almost like I'm in a dream state."</p> <p>I was. It was a fantasy, a fantasy come true, that could only be real. The fact that I was going to be fucked, had to be at least twice as bad as if it had all gone my direction...or was my imagination actually true. I was actually there in the middle of a fantasy, and in the middle of all that excitement, I felt as if there was only this one moment in my life...that moment, where it's just two parts of the other: a fantasy from the time when I first knew of my own desires, and then a reality.</p> <p>I let him fuck my ass for all he was worth. I let him have his way with my body when he wanted to - but not all that - just because I liked it. I enjoyed being fucked in the ass. I loved having it up my ass on a daily basis. In fact, I especially liked it when it came time to return the favour, as I loved the feeling of his thick cock pumping in and out of my rear-end, pushing my butt forward, giving him the pleasure of entering me with a deep, deep thrust.</p> <p>The fact of the matter is, the way that he fucked me was absolutely incredible. He gave me the fucking of a lifetime. I loved every inch of it. I loved every nuance, every sensation, every contour that his thick cock took my backdoor, even though it was my ass...he was so big and strong like that, I did not mind. It hurt, like it does a dam break, when he fucked me in the ass like that. But when he pumped his cock in me...</p> <p>Even though the pleasure was so immense from the fact that all three of my holes were taking his dick up at the same time, it never lost its vigour or enthusiasm. I wanted to do anything to please him. Wanted to get his dick in my mouth, anywhere, anywhere but in the ass. The way that he was fucking me was just too good to resist. He was pumping his cock in and out of my rear, while I took every inch of it up my butt, like I was the most beautiful thing on the planet.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, Tommy. That feels absolutely amazing. You're so good, Tommy. I need to have you all of time. I can't get enough of you. Your cock is so thick and hard and you feel just right inside my bowels, like I've been doing it for years. I can't move for any length of time. It feels so good, Tommy. I feel like I'm floating on a cloud. And that just feels sooo much better than that thing up my butt."</p> <p>As if I were floating on a cloud...his cock in my ass. I wasn't floating on my own cum-slippery ass. He was fucking me. He was fucking all of me. He was fucking me from my ass, even in the process of getting his cock all the way up there, even after my ass got stuffed with his dick. Yes, I was fucking, fucking, fucking...in my own bed. I was fucking in his bed, as he fucked me from my asshole.</p> <p>And he did it like I loved it! So, when it was all over. He was pounding my ass like there was no tomorrow...he was fucking me good and deep, using my rear end as a backstop. I loved it. He was using me. I was taking my own back-door for a pounding. I loved it. I loved it so much that I could barely stand it.</p> <p>But when it was over, I loved it again. This time, just when he had me bent over the back of the sofa, he pulled his cock out as he fucked my ass, like I'm taking a hammer to the back of my body. He used me like I was giving herself to the fuck, which I'd done for him. I'd earned him over and over and over-with our cum inside me.</p> <p></p> <p>I loved it. To admit it. To his power, to it.
