Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.</h4><p><strong>Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now went rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the</strong> western reaches of the British Isles, like a blue streak and a storm cloud, before drifting into the night; the sun.</p> <p>The ice was so much fun. A bit chilly here and there so I was chilled also. So, we did. We took that plunge to the sea. To the ice, in the sea.</p> <p>"I wonder how it feels to have your guts ripped open," whispered Sarah, as we lay in a cocoon between the trees.</p> <p>"It feels as good as ever. I have not felt like this since before I lost my virginity. If only I wasn't such a prude," replied Sarah, still naked and leaning back against me.</p> <p>I rolled to Sarah's side with a smile on my face. I looked over at my beautiful wife, who was topless as well. I looked at her as the cool night rolled away the raindrops. I felt guilty for getting turned on by Sarah's nude body. We had never done anything as wild as this before. If I wasn't at home sleeping in the nude, I certainly was.</p> <p>Sarah was still sleeping. It was then that I finally took a chance and looked down between her legs to see a drop of our combined cum still on her labia. Perhaps I was not so drunk to notice it.</p> <p>"You have never looked at me like that before. I couldn't believe you were awake here, in a strange place. I couldn't believe you were here. You are one of the most beautiful women I've seen. You're so beautiful that you make me feel like I am going to die of pleasure. Oh, baby. I love you."</p> <p>Sarah's eyes opened a bit and her breathing increased. Her lips lifted up and her hips bucked up off the bed. My mouth dropped as my own sex was once more at attention as I had done in the past. I was already beginning to react because of what I was thinking.</p> <p>"I love you too."</p> <p>"Oh, my God," Sarah whispered, in a half-moan.</p> <p>Sarah turned around and put her legs under mine. She moved slightly to accommodate her legs allowing me the chance to put two fingers inside of her. Sarah pushed forward onto my hand as I finger fucked her with an urgency that had been rising inside in the past. Then she wrapped her arms around my neck for a moment longer.</p> <p>"Oh, lover," she whispered to me, almost in a whisper, through her eyes.</p> <p>I kissed her lips and tongue. Our fingers entwined like two snakes in an open river.</p> <p>"I love you too," I said to her, in the middle of all that sex.</p> <p>"I love you," Sarah whispered back.</p> <p>We lay like that for a few more minutes.</p> <p>"Do you remember when we first saw each other naked?" Sarah asked me.</p> <p>"You mean in a car?"</p> <p>"I just thought I might see you again. We never told a soul what we had for us. We never did anything but just stared at each other."</p> <p>"Then I wanted to see you nude. Do you remember what we did last time?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes, I do. I remember what we did to kiss and lick each other. It was so hot and erotic. Your finger was inside my vagina."</p> <p>I rolled on top of Sarah. Our genitals met. Sarah's hand came closer and her lips opened. And our tongues touched. Our hands, hers were on my bottom, and hers were on my upper legs and my buttocks. And then we pulled apart, and kissed. Our kisses were long and passionate, as if trying to draw in the same breath as the other.</p> <p>Sarah lifted herself up and turned my mouth to hers so that we both could be more passionate. Our kisses were wild and intense.</p> <p>"I want to feel you kiss me that way," I said after a few minutes.</p> <p>"I want you to feel me kiss you that way."</p> <p>"I like this all too much. Are you crazy?"</p> <p>"Yes. Because we're at sea, and we're nude and you're not. What do you think?"</p> <p>"I'm not mad at you. We're a couple that would never do anything that bad. I love you. I don't want to get involved in something you've done before. Besides, I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable or anything."</p> <p>"I love you. I love both of you. I love being naked with you."</p> <p>"Then just think that I want to remember being nude with you."</p> <p></p> <p>As we got into the sea, naked and lying there we kissed, there, lying in the sun, and lying on the beach, we fell into the ocean we lay</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>we fell toâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
