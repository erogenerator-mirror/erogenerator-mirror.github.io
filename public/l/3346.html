The Light upon the Moor [Second Report of Dr. Watson]</h4><p><strong>Baskerville Hall, Oct. 15th. MY DEAR HOLMES: If I was compelled to leave you without much news during the early days of my mission you must acknowledge that I am</strong> an extraterrestrial visitor to your planet, in the presence of your alien civilization that you may choose to call home, my home.</p> <p>This is my first posting on this site and I hope you'll keep it as up to our standards as the rest of my story is.</p> <p>You may choose to read the first part of this story or not. You don't need to read any of the comments below to understand how I got that name.</p> <p>*</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>CHAPTER 1</p> <p>Weirdly, that first Sunday after my wife and I got married, I couldn't stop thinking about my wife. How she had taken me so sexually. Didn't we have a relationship, or was this just a sexual thing, she asked me? I had no relationship with either of our spouses. Not that I had any sexual relations with either of them. Maybe, but just for the sake of being, she called me every day, whenever possible, in case I didn't see her in the morning and she was not there. At last I decided I needed another person in our relationship.</p> <p>Well. I hadn't thought of myself in this way at all. She always called me, if there was a time for that, I guess, and I decided it was time that I took action. Maybe, but not now. If nothing else, there was a time for nothing more than just being with her.</p> <p>Then I started calling her from her office in her new office.</p> <p>"What do you think we should talk about, honey?" she asked me one afternoon.</p> <p>"I have a feeling that you already told me. Maybe I can be a little forward," I answered her.</p> <p>"What would you prefer, to talk about it, honey?" she asked again.</p> <p>"I think your sexier, more desirable person, that's quite a bit of information. Let's talk about it," I told her, smiling at her and then feeling a little ashamed at myself for saying it, but at least I thought it sounded so.</p> <p>"So, you have a problem? You seem like you're really happy with me, honey,"</p> <p>"Of course not, my lovely honey, everything's fine with you," I told her. "Besides, you already know that I love your big boobs, and I think you have a wonderful figure,"</p> <p>"Well, no, I don't," she sighed, turning down the subject a little.</p> <p>"How do I know that I'm not an old, fat, ugly old man that's dying, is the truth, darling?" I asked her. "I'm an age that I'm supposed to have the time for. You know, for you to take care of yourself like you do me?"</p> <p>"Yes, of course I do, honey," she answered me with a laugh. "I want everything that I want. Just as I do that man that you see in the movies,"</p> <p>"I'm sure that man can do things that are not normally done to women," I replied, "but I still admire your big breasts and your beautiful ass."</p> <p>"Just one more night, you silly man, I promise you," she promised, but she said it so calmly that she was kidding herself.</p> <p>I didn't know what she meant. Was she trying to convince me to try to be a little more affectionate? I decided at that point to just say no.</p> <p>"Fine," I told her, "just one more night, honey. I'll wait until you're done here so you can take care of yourself for good. Just because I'm horny and all alone in my bedroom on Sunday afternoon, don't mean you need to make love to me for the rest of the weekend. Just you tell me what you want to do and I'll do it."</p> <p>She smiled and said, "Okay, honey, just one night. I'll see you on Monday. And remember, I love your big boobs."</p> <p>"Goodnight, honeyly,"</p> <p>She was smiling that grin again, only now she looked happier, happier as well. She said, "I love it when you go down on me. I just cannot believe that men really are such good kissers,"</p> <p>I laughed and said, "I like your style too, but it's not my style. I love kissing you. Just lie down for me and I'll kiss you all over. I want to do everything that you can do to make you happier,"</p> <p>"Okay, just one more night, and we'll forget the night is long," she said, smiling. "I'll lie on the beach after I'll lie in your bed, just like you,"</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Just one more until I</p> <p></p> <p>you The world That is What are.
