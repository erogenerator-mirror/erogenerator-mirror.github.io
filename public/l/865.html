It was one afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Ad�le in the grounds: and while she played with Pilot</strong>'s Whore, with him holding my skirt away from my ass, that's what had happened. He had gone down on me, taking out a dick to my ass, and I had loved it, loved every second of it that he had, until it seemed that I enjoyed it too, but that he, too, could not hold it against me until I did it to him. "It's really hot to watch a nice guy with a dick in your ass," I told him. "And I love to watch an ass get fucked."</p> <p>And, while he was still on me to give me a good, hard fucking, I asked my partner: "Did you enjoy it, Darling?"</p> <p>"I enjoyed it, too, sweetie. Can we make out for a bit? Please?"</p> <p>And I did. She did, too, but it was awkward at first. But, after a bit, after he had taken off my strap-on, and I'd cum for him, he was ready again. And he was more relaxed now—maybe because of his current erection, if I recall correctly, he was more in control of the situation now. I liked it—so much that his hands went straight to my naked ass. His hands came back again, and again, and again. A guy's hands don't belong in the hands of his wife, but in mine. He didn't put his dick back inside me—I wanted him to do that again. I had had an orgasm.</p> <p>We weren't talking, but I noticed that he was not hard at all now. I had just had an orgasm—not just mine, but his also, too, and—I suppose, the thing that you can expect, but I can't say that he wasn't ready. It seemed to make him excited to say it, if that's what it could be.</p> <p>After that, we continued to do things all around that had started, and he was more and more comfortable, and I started showing him what I found to be really hot to watch. He liked it, I bet. That made him fuck me more, and he fucked me even harder, too.</p> <p>"Yes. Oh, yes," I cried. "Fuck me, Mr. Rochester! Fuck me! Fuck me hard!"</p> <p>As I begged Mr. Rochester to fuck me, he did, indeed. He pulled back long enough that his tool rested between my ass cheeks, and after he had pulled my face between his hands, I could smell my pussy on his dick, and, though I might be surprised to hear it, I really like smelling my juices on his dick, too.</p> <p>And I loved it when he entered me—and, when he pulled back, he kept up the pace of fuck. He pulled back, and when he had entered, he kept up the pace, and it was great, it was even better, I was so glad he started to fuck me.</p> <p>"That's much, much better," I said.</p> <p>"I think you're just about to," he said.</p> <p>"I'm about to," I agreed.</p> <p>The next round we had was on the patio—actually, just the patio. Adèle had left us two towels there, as we waited for her to return with a glass of wine. Mr. Rochester said he needed a shower first, but before he got to it, he had to hold still, and then he had to hold still for a while, just so I could watch, while he got his shower. He'd told me the whole thing that he had to go to the bathroom, because he didn't have the whole thing: he had to hold his dick inside, and it was that moment that I noticed him standing under the shower, while the sound in the shower was not even audible to him, it was his own breathing.</p> <p>"Does that sound wonderful? It's just like when you're trying to be quiet under a hot shower," I said.</p> <p>"It sounds amazing, Darling," he acknowledged, "but it sounds even better," he went on.</p> <p>"So do I," I said, "just let me help you with it?"</p> <p>We went back inside the house and I brought him a towel and had him dry me. I got his dick up and I bent over toward it so that we could both see everything. While he dry me, I bent lower for him. I wanted him to fuck me in the ass, but he wasn't going to have it. I also wanted him to fuck me inside the house—inside my cunt, he'd probably already made out with another girl who'd been there.</p> <p>"Turn around, Darling. Let's see what you're doing down here," I say."</p> <p></p> <p>He turned around, and I saw him, of course that it was. And I found him and he was as he had his dick—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
