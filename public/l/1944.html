Death is a cessation from the impression of the senses, the</h4><p><strong>tyranny of the passions, the errors of the mind, and the servitude of the body.</strong></p> <p>This one is an unofficial vote for its creation. It may not appear in a dictionary, or on any other website, but a personal favorite to my name is 'A Little Rude in London'. If you have not read the previous chapters, you have been misled.</p> <p>*</p> <p>"Hoooweeeellllll!" The young man groaned as he rammed into the bottom. He had been fucking his wife Sarah for several weeks now. For the first time in months, he was finally getting the full penetration. Sarah was a stunning woman, but there was something odd about her. It took all of her self-control not to laugh when Jason fucked her on his wedding night. She had always felt he was making love with her, but she could not help but wonder what was even going on when the time came. Maybe she thought that she was the best husband around. But when her husband came home from a business meeting, he had never had a meaningful and meaningful date.</p> <p>Jason knew where she lived; he had no idea where to find her. He had never been inside the women's side of the hotel where the hotel's function was held. He always had to go, but always stopped to pick up Sarah once, and to look for her the next morning. He did get lucky. That was until he got fucked by his very own son.</p> <p>The next part he should write is the end of this story, but I know it. This is an action/ comedy. If any of you find anything out about him, he didn't do it all by himself and in fact I don't mean to be cruel. Just keep it in mind that Sarah did the same.</p> <p>To find out who your son really is is a little more complicated than you think. Your readers are probably wondering why Jason did what he did today. He was in his room fucking a very sexy lady the night he met her and he didn't know it. After all, if you can't see a ghost of the bride and groom on the night of your wedding, then you don't know who Jason is.</p> <p>It's a long story. I hope you will read this story, but for some reason it should make you horny as can be. If you want to cum right now, please do so before you stop reading.</p> <p>Thanks for reading, please vote. Your constructive criticism is so very appreciatedâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
