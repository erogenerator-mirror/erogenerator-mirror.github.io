Hippocrates having cured many sicknesses, fell sick himself and</h4><p><strong>died. The Chaldeans and Astrologians having foretold the deaths of divers, were afterwards themselves surprised by the fates. Alexander and Pompeius, and Caius Caesar, having destroyed so many towns, and</strong> so many cities, were killed and replaced by the enemy. And Caius of Rome, having already conquered so many, and his armies were now ready to fight.</p> <p>The women took off both their tunics and sat naked on their knees facing the other. They could now see their husbands in a sexual pose in front of them. They were both nude, as they approached the two men, now in the midst of their own sexual play.</p> <p>The women saw that two of the men had come up to them. They were wearing only the red robes of an Emperor. The Emperor had on a black tunic with a gold ribbon and a very high cowl from which hung a golden pendant. It was encircled with an eagle. Both wore silver or red or silver garb and their robes looked very much alike against their nakedness. The woman was kneeling over the man, and, as their robes had descended, his penis was standing erect while they leaned in toward each other.</p> <p>Their breasts were almost completely obscured by their robes. Their nipples were erect and their breasts were being drawn close together at the waist and pulled apart, to expose their pussies. The men were kissing each other passionately and both had their faces buried in the other's breasts.</p> <p>The woman had her face buried in the man's genitals, tonguing his testicles. The man was moaning softly. He pulled her face away from his genitals and began to massage his testicles while masturbating. Their passion had quickened. The pair were kissing, holding each other's heads, and pushing and pulling. In a few moments he had spurted into the other's mouth. They kept the kiss going as long as possible before he stepped back.</p> <p>They remained there, the man stroking the women's face until they finally got up. Their robes were still wrapped around their bodies and they didn't try to cover their nakedness. The women had moved closer, to kneel in the pews next to Caius. Their pussies were facing each other. Their asses were near each other's legs. Both could feel one another's pussies lightly rubbing against each other. The man, his cock still hard and pushing out into the night, had his arms around Caius, his hands all over her back, her breasts, and her ass. He was whispering in her ear in Greek to her how proud he was of her. The woman had her left hand inside his robe, on his cock. The man could feel the heat and wetness of Caius' and the other's pussies. Their tongues were intertwined, their lips were pressed together firmly against each other.</p> <p>Amen, the Romans, they both said in their native tongue. The man had his fingers on the woman's clitoris.</p> <p>One of the women leaned forward, to kiss the man's cock fully. Caius was on his left, leaning back against the altar, holding his arms out toward the other. The other man, his face in the woman's pussy, and Caius still holding her clitoris. He kissed her lips, her nose, her eyes, and her forehead. He kissed the other's lips, and the woman pressed her breasts against the man's bare chest, while the man caressed her ass and stroked her vulva.</p> <p>They kissed some more. Their tongues touched and played. They kissed again. And as one, they moved to a sitting position. Caius had his hand on the woman's thighs, while he kissed her with her lips close to his. He moved toward her breasts, caressing them. Caius' cock throbbing against her belly. He could feel her nipples on his cheeks as he kissed her. He slowly moved his hands up her thighs while kissing her. She let out a soft but muffled groan.</p> <p>And then Caius' hand began to roam. With one hand he rubbed her clitoris as two of his fingers slowly entered her cunt. He did this several times. Both women were moaning and gasping. And the other's moans became more vocal.</p> <p>The man and woman were in a 69 position. Neither man knew if they were seeing the other in the position they were in. The other's mouth on the other's pussy. Caius' mouth on Caius' cock. The other's cunt on his mouth.</p> <p>Now that it was really happening, a few of the women had begun to have orgasms. The men were getting close to their own. The woman put her hands through the other's hair and rubbed her clitoris into his face as the man sucked her tits and gently pushed his fingers in and out of her cunt. As the man was kissing her and both, his hands playing at the female's pusss nipples. in his legs.</p> <p></p> <p>as the woman moved to a circle, to the other woman.
