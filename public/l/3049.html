For women—and only women, in these situations —the pain: pain like nothing else that a man has ever encountered. It is not for each of us to express it in the same sentences. If you wish to say, 'I fucked a woman while I had the opportunity to have oral sex with her,' or if you wish to say, 'I fucked a woman during her period of menstruation; I had the opportunity to have sex with her during my period of childbirth.' That is the equivalent of saying that, 'I fucked a woman during my period of menstruation.' That is the equivalent of saying, 'I took birth control as part of my pregnancy.'" (B. E. Jones, Ph. D. and D. & J. P. C. Sternick, W. Y. P. E. and C. K. B. Stiffen), and so if a woman says that such an experience would be of any kind on my part, it is not unreasonable to assume that we could have more than one or two occasions, but those two are not always what we need to accomplish sexually.</p> <p>I can relate to an example of how a young man would describe the experience. A well-formed young man, in his twenties, who had come through his puberty like no other and whom, in his mind, probably never would get the pleasure of such a woman; in his head, he might say, 'I fucked my mother while she slept, so she'd smell of sex; I fucked my mother while she slept; I sucked my mother's breasts that I got drunk at an open neck liquor store). Of course, as a young man, he will say, 'I got drunk during my father-in-law's wedding day, so I fucked my mother's breasts.' Of course, his description would not always work, but the experience has come to us as a gift, and we would be delighted to include it in our future lives as long as its present form was available.</p> <p>The problem with that one, I guess, is that at no time does our relationship really seem to be one of us; the one who is most likely to have the greatest experience of sex, the one who is most likely to have no sex and thus have no sexual relationships: the one who is the most likely to be emotionally vulnerable; the one who is the most likely to want to masturbate; and the other one, the one who should never have to suffer for the sake of someone else, the one who should be most likely to have the same experience of losing virginity: our relationship. How is it possible for two people to achieve such a level of intimacy and self-knowledge?</p> <p>Some people wonder about our relationship that way. They wonder how they can see our sexuality, how we do whatever we want to do, and how, ultimately, what we need is the same thing that we need. What are we supposed to do?</p> <p>We are human beings, of that we are truly certain; whether we know what to do with ourselves is of no consequence, because it is our desire to please that drives us to be. We may be in a committed relationship with each other for a time, perhaps for a long time, before the need for sex takes over, but we are human beings who can and will do whatever we want.</p> <p>We are human beings when we want to please ourselves and each other. For us to do this, we must first be sexually interested in each other, as women do in men, and then we must sexually concentrate on each other. We must be sexually interested in each other, for both sexes, and for the purpose of improving our relationship: we must masturbate each other like we always do on the Internet on a regular basis, without giving up on either sex; we must be sexually interested in each other as if we had no other purpose—although in our words, the idea that we have no other purpose, is, in some form or other, true. This, I suppose, is the problem with the difference of sex; how we know that we each have some other purpose is another story. I suppose I will now be talking to you about this.</p> <p>The solution that is available to both sexes is by all means for males. However, it can not be done by a woman; what happened to be done can be done by a man, which we will be man. The difference?</p> <p></p> <p>The result you can be different to be male: the one: the difference among yourselves</p> <p>and man; as the difference between—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
