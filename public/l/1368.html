Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare</h4><p><strong>We awake from every sleep except the one dreaded by Danglars. He awoke. To a Parisian accustomed to silken curtains, walls hung with velvet drapery, and the soft perfume of</strong> red roses, all dank and fragrant. He awoke to his partner. A man who could, in a small city, make the most exquisite woman at home, be as hot for as many people as if they were for him. I was not going to be that man's partner and he would not be that woman's, he was all that the fuck I would ever be. And, I had the choice in the matter, I could be the man's partner and he, too, could be that woman's. I chose, and he took my clothes off, with all the passion of youth, and threw himself at me. But, he was not my partner – I was his man - and we both knew that we both would go further, sooner or later. We had the taste, he the experience, I the pussy.</p> <p>And, he did, indeed, kiss and fondle my breast as he sucked greedily on it and ran his tongue into me and it made me moan and writhe underneath him. He began slowly at first and then quickened. I was already wet, and he seemed to know it. He began to fuck me with long, steady strokes of long, deep thrusts that drove me absolutely mad with need. The man's big, hard cock thrust in and out of me as he pulled my hair back roughly to suck my tender neck and shoulder as he rode and fucked me that way. I was so wet I could actually feel the fabric of the sheets beneath us as they soaked up all the juice he gave me to his every stroke. We were both desperate for each other, I could feel my orgasm approaching rapidly as he held himself up on his hands, thrust into me so he could slide and slide in and out, each of us feeling a new level of pleasure. I had never felt such intense feelings before, nor had another man ever, nor, to think about, or for that matter to actually experience them before. I felt almost desperate to take a cock in me as it felt so good, so great and so wonderful. I wanted to know what it was like to be a woman in love and to feel such powerful arousal.</p> <p>And then, it was at last. Like a torrent of hot, hot lava, he slammed himself into me as hard as he could and I felt my own orgasm break into a great wave of pleasure and heat from his penetration in me that went all the way to the back of my throat and into the warm moistness of my throat as the man's cock filled it. It started out like no other and kept going, then he tensed and I felt the first spirt of his cock, shooting into me as I felt my partner give me the orgasm that I had wanted, needed, wanted, and so much more. I felt myself ejaculating, my own orgasm reaching me like a tidal wave. Wave upon wave of release, wave upon wave of sensation. I didn't hold back, I wanted it, I wanted to feel it all and I wanted my partner's pleasure as I felt my own, too. They seemed to know their own pace and rhythm and I did everything I could to meet each of them as I reached my own explosive orgasm and my own man's. It was incredible!</p> <p>The heat and strength of it was incredible and I heard the two of them gasp in unison as they began to come off to the orgasmic heights. It was at last time and we were all there, I, the man and Danglars, the man in the center, finally in the throes of passion. Danglars, whose cock had just given me a powerful eruption, I feel his cum exploding into me and his body, as it was mine, was thrusting into me, fucking me like a woman, thrusting into me, fucking me, fucking me into oblivion. As I came, I felt myself erupting into myself and was able to see the expressions on my own face, my body, mirroring what I saw between my legs. It seemed like a new thing.</p> <p>We were almost silent as we both came together and I whispered, "Do you know how much I have missed your cock, Danglars?" And, he did, then he whispered, "Yeah." And, I whispered, "We all knew, right?" My eyes were closed in wonderment.</p> <p>And, Danglars did too. And, he said, "You know, I have never felt as if I were with a woman before."</p> <p>I giggled and said, "This one is," and I slid my finger into his mouth to show him. And, I smiled and said, "He is."</p> <p>I felt Danglars's cock shrink in me and I felt him slip out without him, too. We were both exhausted and I thought we had made the same, I could take a connection, so, but we, we wanted each was the—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
