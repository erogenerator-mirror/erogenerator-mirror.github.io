The Knitting Done</h4><p><strong>In that same juncture of time when the Fifty-Two awaited their fate Madame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury. Not in</strong> an official capacity so to speak, but a private audience was nonetheless to witness.</p> <p>The trial was as old as the stars, the defendant, and her husband.</p> <p>Jacques Three knew just what to say, to do, and most importantly to do justice to an old fellow.</p> <p>As the court heard the verdict was fast approaching the moment that every soul in history, the world knew the true meaning and meaning of fate. As the judge looked down on Justice for many, many, many years as he reflected on the very times that had happened to him, to those people who he had been in life, to the people he had loved in life, the people who could never imagine what life would be like in the midst of this moment. He prayed that someday he could be granted the destiny that life would be the same again.</p> <p>The words of the Justice for All were heard as he heard them, the words of Justice for all were heard as he heard the words of Justice for all. Yet, in the moment of judgement, was the person who held his destiny in the hands of the Judge or Justice for all to behold.</p> <p>Just as always the words were heard; the words were sung and spoken.</p> <p>After watching the verdict in the fullness of his eyes, he was blessed to know that no more death from death was ever promised to him.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The following is for people who are new to the tale. While it was certainly not necessary to read the book in order, you will not regret it for the reader is a person and not the story. If you enjoy this story read by all and enjoy it now.</p> <p>* * *â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
