So here we am again, as lovers, we kiss, she moans softly and we both slide closer to one another.</p> <p>We make love as we have always dreamed our first time would, we kiss, I feel her hand reach for my breast and I moan her name, she says,</p> <p>"Let's not do that honey, I want to make her all the hot and squishy you know it all about me in this day of sex; let's think what we could do together that has me feeling so good." I feel her hand cup my breast, I gasp, she laughs, I laugh, I kiss her passionately, oh, as we kiss passionately I imagine what to do. I could imagine all that, I could take her as far as she would allow me, I could fuck her to oblivion, she might not want to fuck me again so soon?</p> <p>She is the best of both worlds, she laughs loudly as she playsfully smacks my ass with her hand and she says,</p> <p>"Honey, what's the matter with you that you can just slide a huge thing up my ass again?" I laugh, I feel her cock press into me and she says,</p> <p>"Well, maybe I could fuck you in the ass now." I laugh and I feel her cock pressing into the crevice of my ass, I laugh again and I feel her hand on my ass, she laughs again, I can't help it, I push against her cock and she says,</p> <p>"Ok, whatever, go with it." She laughs again, I reach down and playfully pull into her cock and as I do I feel her hands on my breasts, she groans and she says,</p> <p>"Baby, your breasts are so lovely, they felt so good on me." She smiles at me and I smile back and I feel her hand fondling my breast, then down over my belly and she touches my clit and she groans softly as she slides her finger between my lips and she strokes my clit, she says,</p> <p>"Mmm, you taste so good; you feel so hard, you're so hard there, I'm going to cum all over you." I smile at her and I slide onto her cock and I feel the top of her shaft. I begin to lift her cock and I feel her hands pulling my face towards her breasts as I feel the top of her cock being sucked upon her belly button. With every movement, I feel as her skin slides within my lips.</p> <p>"Ooooh, oh oh, oh,"</p> <p>"Oh, do you want me to make your cum, hime!" I want to feel this pleasure, she laughs as we kiss, I feel her hand grip my breast and I feel it slide across my nipple, I kiss her, I push into her and I kiss her passionately, she's so nice and so hot, I feel my orgasm approaching rapidly and I kiss her harder, I want to make her cum; I want to make her cum in your mouth, ohhhhhhhhhhh, cum on my face, she moans loudly and I feel her cock press against my lips as she begins to cum, she moans louder and I lick her as she has done to me, I can taste her cum as it flows from my mouth.</p> <p>She slides off me and as she does my eyes meet hers and I smile and I see the happiness, the happiness, the joy of being together. We make love passionately again and as we do she smiles at me and I feel so happy, I look in her eyes and she laughs,</p> <p>"Is there any future in this relationship that is something that we should not discuss right now?" I laugh, she smiles and we kiss once more. This is always good; we both know and as I hold her hand I can't help but caress and I feel her hand slide onto my breast.</p> <p>* -- PM—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
