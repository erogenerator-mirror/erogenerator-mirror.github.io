"I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with, if I felt no desire for its continuance, or</strong> even to be despoiled by a lustful, depraved tongue."</p> <p>Elinor's heart skipped a beat as she took her clothes off. She had never been much of a fashion object, although she loved the attention she received by the girls she danced with. However, her body had gone limp in an effort to recover and she had a moment of lucidity as to where it was going. She had taken off her clothes quickly since her first dance with a partner.</p> <p>Elinor was a gorgeous woman, with fair skin, long, long black hair, eyes dark with desire, and a voluptuous body that was more a man-shape than a woman. Her breasts were large and stood up with hardened nipples pointing to the air, which were a vivid purple that could barely be seen through the soft skin of her aureole. Her stomach was wide with her hips and thighs tight, almost perfect. Elinor had never been attracted by anyone's body before and was unsure of what she wanted to do, but something about her that drew her into the conversation, which turned Elinor on.</p> <p>Elinor removed her bra, and, feeling naughty, dropped it on the couch next to her discarded clothes. However, when Elinor got up to put on her bra, the top of the bra was exposed which meant the nipples were hard and erect, as usual. Elinor felt a rush, as if she had no control over them, and had no control over her feelings regarding sex.</p> <p>Now Elinor had had a few lesbian relationships and the intensity between her and Simon had been a bit of a shock, even with her partner. Her interest had always been with Simon, although it was not until he found himself enjoying another lesbian lover that Elinor began to wonder what it would be like to feel a cock, whether it was a man or a woman's cock inside her.</p> <p>Elinor put on her bra and put on hers as her eyes were fixed on her nipples, which had hardened noticeably and a pink glow appeared to her stomach and thighs.</p> <p>"You look great in your bra," Simon commented.</p> <p>"Why thank you. It's very sexy." Elinor felt her stomach rumble with a little trepidation.</p> <p>"I have always noticed that," Simon murmured, not mentioning the fact that Elinor always wore stockings to a dance. He didn't seem to mind too much what she wore, in fact he seemed to be enjoying the moment immensely. "You look great in a stockings. If you take off your bra, we'll see," Simon added.</p> <p>Elinor took a deep breath, took off her bra and placed it over a cushion to catch the sweat. She had never seen women's breasts before, so she didn't know what to make of them, either.</p> <p>Although she had been attracted to Simon in her first encounter with Elinor, and had loved to see him undress other women, she never imagined how different that could be, how different sexual encounters could be. With Simon's words she wanted more, of that she knew.</p> <p>Elinor's heart pounded at the thought of him undressing and taking off all her clothes. Her nipples stood hard and erect as she looked at him, then up at him as he approached. Simon's face showed an uncertain expression as he took a closer look at the beautiful breasts of hers. The eyes of the women of the ballet class came into view as they stood up proudly.</p> <p>Simon could have been imagining them for days. The breasts were massive, with pink, rosy nipples, and they were clearly in need of massaging. His mouth watered as he watched the lovely curves of them being manipulated. The breasts were slightly larger than Elinor's, but he never really understood what a "C" cup would be as a bra, although he had seen one in Paris in her bra, just as it was, and he had thought it would look beautiful. But Elinor's breasts were the size of a child. Elinor, with her large, full breasts, and their round, fleshy, shapely mounds, seemed even larger, fuller, and more muscular than a woman of her own gender, but the feminine curves looked incredible on her.</p> <p>Simon, though, never imagined that a young woman of his age would be such a lovely specimen of femininity, despite the great breasts and hard nipples he had seen in a woman's form. Elinor was now standing a bit taller than Simon by at least a half-inch. Though he had thought it, it was an amazing turn on watching another man look at a beautiful woman. Elin, although, in that had not been the case. Simon's sex had turned into fantasy it.</p> <p></p> <p>When Elin went to be with a man and Simon, Simon had a woman.
