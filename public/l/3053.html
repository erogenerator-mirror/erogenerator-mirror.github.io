You've already said that. Now we can share them.</p> <p>[*brief]We love them with a passion and a desire.</p> <p>[*brief]We love with a passion and a desire.</p> <p>[*brief]We're the first in line to have our orgasms; we're the first to have our orgasms.</p> <p>[*brief]We're the first to have our orgasms.</p> <p>[*brief]We're the first to have our orgasms.</p> <p>[*brief]We're the first in line to have our orgasms.</p> <p>[*brief]We're the first in line to have our orgasms.</p> <p>[*brief]We're the first in line after having our orgasms and still want.</p> <p>And we're the first in line at the last.</p> <p>Now we know what joy it is when sex is inevitable. The first things we remember when we are together in the room. The first things we remember when we're naked in bed together.

It may look like an action ball, I promise.</p> <p>I have always found those moments of passion to be most erotic if their context is appropriate in my life. Let some words and thoughts get carried away for a little while, and then let the moment itself become one with you because you love a sense of passion for yourself. Perhaps that brings me to my next lesson.</p> <p>###â€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
