English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>Chapter XLVI. The Vision and the Enigma.</h4><p><strong>“The Vision and the Enigma” is perhaps an example of Nietzsche in his most obscure vein. We must know how persistently he inveighed against the oppressing and depressing influence of</strong> religion, religion, religion, or religion”.</p> <p>With my left hand I grasped the end of the penis, and my right hand continued to thrust in and out. I felt the muscles in his thighs ripple, and I looked forward with approval.</p> <p>“The End,” he said, “Let nature have mercy on you for a few moments.</p> <p>I felt his legs lift around mine. His knees were beside my thighs, like this, like this and he pulled off my shirt. I turned my head to the right, looking into his eyes as I removed it.</p> <p>“We shall have time for your first lesson, young man. I intend to give myself to your guidance for many months.</p> <p>I felt my erect penis throbbing, and he could not contain his excitement. He was still thrusting so wildly that his cock was almost horizontal.</p> <p>I placed my lips on one of his nipples, and it instantly hardened. He put both hands on my head, pushing his chest to me. The way his skin was shaking, I could smell his excitement.</p> <p>I began to rub my thumb over the area right below his anus. I felt the ring of muscle tense, and I knew what he wanted. I knew what he wanted.</p> <p>I felt his penis throbbing again. He put one hand on the back of my neck, forcing me into his chest by pressing his forearms into my shoulders. It felt good, and it was good. He held on for few more seconds, then pulled me up to him, almost like I was going to run down at the drop of a hat. In response I could only kiss him and suck his lips. He had only one hand holding my neck as we passionately kissed, and he slowly undid it with his right hand, then put his hands on my hips.</p> <p>“Oh yes, yes, yes,” he moaned, “I want you to feel me in your body, to fuck you, to have a real body to fuck”.</p> <p>“Please, let me put something inside your body, to use it to fuck, to make you come,” I whispered.</p> <p>We were silent. I don’t know how long it took him to remove his shirt.</p> <p>“Is that what you want?” I questioned him.</p> <p>“Yes, yes, God, yes”, he said, “Give me something, please,” and he began to undress.</p> <p>There were two of us, naked. Our flesh-and-blood bodies were still trembling as he pulled his shorts off.</p> <p>Then his shorts hit the floor, along with his underwear. It was an instant and a beautiful sight to behold. Our bodies were one, and his penis was a solid, smooth and hairless. The head was long and thick, even without foreskin and the base was almost smooth, as it was the only part of him that had any skin. The shaft had a slight upward curve but seemed to bend around his body in a way that showed us what we wanted. It had a slight curve to it.</p> <p>He pulled down the underpants and showed me how the pubic hair on his member protruded out from under the foreskin. At the base he revealed a bit of black pubic hair. He was hairy.</p> <p>“Do you like to fuck?” I asked him. I could only nod.</p> <p>“I’m a virgin,” he whispered, “I can't fuck you. If I do, will you be with in your life?””</p> <p>“Please, yes,” I answered, “if the pleasure you have is worth the pain and humiliation I will love to have. And the pleasure your body can give me, is worth the pain and humiliation”. He kissed me again as he took off his underwear and let it fall in a heap on the floor. We were now both naked. We embraced, and our bodies pressed together. His hand moved toward my anus then down one of my buttocks. It was already wet, and he felt no pre-seminal fluid. He pressed his penis against me there. His penis felt long and thick, like a cock, but the head was hard. His balls were heavy and it felt like they were trying to scratch my thighs.</p> <p>“Oh please, no, no…” and he pressed the head against my anus.</p> <p>“I don’t want to fuck you,”,”, I whispered, I thought.</p> <p></p> <p>“I felt his hand moved to my cheeks and I felt him press against me, pressing my cheeks. His dick was against my hole with his—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
