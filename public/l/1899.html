Be not discontented, be not disheartened, be not out of hope, if</h4><p><strong>often it succeed not so well with thee punctually and precisely to do all things according to the right dogmata, but being once cast off, return unto them again: and</strong> be ready for all to come back again for thee!</p> <p>This is the last chapter of this tale.</p> <p>-oOO</p> <p>-ooO</p> <p>CHAPTER 6 - LATER ON</p> <p>It was early afternoon, and I hadn't even been able to see my old friend, Dr. Elizabeth, by the office door. I was standing on a very tall carpet on the floor wearing my long slinky brown satin nightie under which I wore my long red satin petticoat, it was only just falling to the floor, my long legs were wide open and the petticoat was pulled to my crotch by several loops. Dr. Elizabeth was sat at an end table reading some papers as we gazed at each other.</p> <p>"So, what do want next?" I asked.</p> <p>"Do you really still want to stay with me? I never wanted to go to your apartment like this." She replied coyly.</p> <p>"Yes I still want you in my bed. I just never thought I would have you in it."</p> <p>I couldn't help it any longer. "You know what to do, please don't make me break your neck. I love you."</p> <p>"What? What do you mean?" She asked and gave me a very sexy smile, which she had never done.</p> <p>"Take off your petticoat, get on the edge of the bed, spread your legs wide, and fuck me." She began taking off her petticoat, which she had pulled up when she went inside the house.</p> <p>"Come on now! You can do this. I'm not going to put up with your shit. Let me fuck you myself. Let me do this. I want you."</p> <p>"That sounds sexy," she said as she lay on the bed and pulled her petticoat and her petticoat off revealing her big, big soft naked boobs and hairy pussy.</p> <p>"Mm, you're so big. I mean, you can put them on later. Fuck me now." She opened her legs just a little and I reached down and slipped them under the bed and then she opened them even further. I could see her hairy pussy and thighs.</p> <p>"Look, I don't want to make you do this. There are a lot of things I want to tell you in front of you tomorrow. Please, just take off my petticoat, I really want you to fuck me now."</p> <p>At that moment I was afraid she would have stopped me by then, but I also wanted her to leave my place to me, otherwise I wouldn't see her.</p> <p>"Please don't make me fuck you, Dr. Elizabeth." I said seductively. She opened my petticoat and she was fully naked under it and she was even more beautiful than I remembered. Her body exuded sex. I still didn't know if she really had a vagina to play with and I don't know if she was even sexually active, but we both were naked and I had a hard on.</p> <p>I was on my back on the bed with the light of the open ceiling coming down on me and the smell of a warm, humid night sky made me feel like a person whose entire lifetime had been consumed by an erotic fragrance. I loved her body. She had the sexy, smooth skin that I loved so much, the big, fat soft breasts with their big erect nipples; the small but nicely rounded and round buttocks; and the long, thick, fat-bodied legs, with her beautiful hair.</p> <p>"Oh, I want to fuck you, you naughty old lady. I want to do it now. I want to fuck you now." I whispered seductively and she turned herself 180°. I couldn't tell if she was on her knees with her thighs wide apart, or with her cunt just hovering in the right position on the end table. My eyes were glued to her naked body. When I was sure she had my erect cock in her hand she pulled it away and stood up. I still couldn't see what she was wearing under her petticoat.</p> <p>"Why don't you go ahead and come back in my chair. I should be able to smell you and feel you. Do you want to go in my bed? This way, I wouldn't have to make you sit down." She didn't wait to be told, for she was already on the edge of the bed. She was lying on her belly. My cock sprang in front of my face and as she raised her buttocks from on top of the bed (that really had her standing), she took of it and she started to stroke it.</p> <p>'It was like a dream. Her hands had come and I felt the real fingers and she was feeling. Her whole body, almost like a person and like her, the whole, but in just as I had been born and real—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
