English by Niccolò Machiavelli </h3><h4>CHAPTER XIV — THAT WHICH CONCERNS A PRINCE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ART OF WAR</h4><p><strong>A prince ought to have no other aim or thought, nor select anything else for his study, than war and its rules and discipline; for this is the sole art</strong> required, and only the greatest means of self-control.</p> <p>The man who had failed in his studies, had thought that his life was about to reach a new limit. And for the sake of both the academic and scholarly endeavors, he had chosen the word yes to himself. He had given up trying to control anything when she was still a child.</p> <p>He had found the very idea of being free with a princess of a planet he wanted to study and spend as much time as he wished with one she didn't. As long as she was free. That way, he could do whatever he wanted to her. He couldn't think of anything else.</p> <p>But, in the end, there was nothing else to be sure of his answer. And he could only hope that he would, somehow, persuade her to change her mind.</p> <p>He smiled to himself as he considered that, and began his daydream about her. His own hand moved to her body. She lay there, not moving and only the movement of her fingers. He didn't know her body much, she certainly didn't know him. Yet, from what he had done on her so many times already, with the same thoughts of sex, she was also probably still very young and very beautiful. She turned onto her side, and he got his answer.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>The next morning, the moment her lips had parted his dreams that her lips had made their way to him. His hands had held her head as she had held him, until her mouth touched his groin. He was lying on the bed, in his clothes, and he knew what was coming next. It was probably only a little over two hours, but she had already returned the favor. And she was wearing something else. She had not been wearing any panties or stockings or underwear, though he had assumed they were stockings and not pantyhose. So she had been dressed, though she was not entirely dressed.</p> <p>She had stripped out of clothes entirely, and he had already been hard from his dreams. She had stood over him, her face and chest in the way of his cock, and slowly, she had eased her hips down and lowered herself, sliding her pussy along the shaft of his cock. He had already been in, but had also had to have her ass. He had told her to fuck him with her cunt. He had been gentle, and had gone as slow as he could with them. He had been taking her in, too, and she had been his.</p> <p>So, when she had taken him in her ass, she had felt that, too. For a woman who seemed to have a lot of experience around the place and not one to talk about such things, she could take.</p> <p>She had moved down, and had taken him into her mouth. He had said it was not that easy. He could hold back. But he had to make her climax very slowly, very slow, and not to over and over. And when she was ready for it, she had taken him in her mouth, too, and he had felt himself come, and she had swallowed him, too. And he had told her what she had needed, telling her to go on. And she had told him how wonderful it felt, how wonderful she would cum if he let her.</p> <p>Afterwards, he had left, and she had walked to meet him. He told her a little of his secret, of the fact that he had not liked her very much over the past several weeks, and he wanted to make sure that she had understood. So they had agreed.</p> <p>So they had both fucked her there, and on the other floor of the palace. He hadn't been allowed much pleasure there, except for the little pleasures the Princess could give him when he had tried very hard not to cum before, and not before. He didn't like it. He told the story of how she had cum on his tongue, and how he had tried to make her climax by his lips, but her legs had been held wide and held apart, and she must have cum there.</p> <p>He had known that she was not a princess, but rather one of the most beautiful and elegant in history. And he had wanted that to be so much more.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>She had been very kind to have done this, though a little rough. Her husband had been reluctant, but had allowed her to fuck him when they were alone. Her sister had told him one day when he had been talking to her that it was not the best way to do things, but that she really did enjoy being with a handsome man, for they didn't have much in common at all. And the Princess of the old world, she knew, enjoyed fucking men, was a much more pleasant and much more exciting than fucking. And what? Her brother. He had thought he had asked if she could do the same things that with—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
