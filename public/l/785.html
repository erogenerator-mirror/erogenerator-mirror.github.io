He crossed a small “branch”</strong> of his lane, which ran over the crest of a mountain, and came to an abrupt halt with a soft knock on the door to his house. He looked around, but the house was dark. He didn’t care to give up the view of a beautiful girl, so he gave up his plan and walked through the house as quickly as possible.</p> <p>He came across a pile of flowers, and as soon as he was behind the house he took one in one hand and walked to the other. He was wearing dark jeans that hugged his hips, and a button-up shirt with a few buttons open. The room was lit up by a half-dozen candles that surrounded him and they were flickering in various ways. He sat down on an ottoman and took a long pull from the bottle of water. “This is nice,” he said, after he had finished. The candles’ effect on the room had his eyes glowing. “It’s all yours,” he lied, but the look in his eyes told her otherwise.</p> <p>He took a large bath. He lit lots of candles and sprinkled a little water in every available spot, and then stood up. He opened his arms and beckoned to her, and she slipped down into them. She wrapped arms and legs around him and they kissed passionately. He slid to his knees and started gently stroking her face. She began sliding her hands down his chest and across his stomach, and she started feeling his cock through him pants, even through his pants. She unzipped him and took his cock right out of his pants and started stroking him. She stroked him for a bit until he felt her take him in her mouth. Her lips were moist and moist and he felt her mouth slide down over his member in one fluid motion, but then she stopped.</p> <p>She stood up and looked to the side of him – he was standing in the half darkness of the hall. He realized that the night’s shadows would soon stop, but she hadn't finished looking around. He smiled at her as he stepped from the water, still hard as a rock. He reached for her as she undid her belt and dropped pants. She grabbed his shirt and pulled him toward her on to the tiled floor, while she stripped off his shirt. She threw him down on his stomach and straddled him. He felt her hand glide down the length of his cock and she rubbed her thumb over the tip. She moved forward, and he felt the tip move closer to her pussy. There was a brief pause as she felt the tip of his cock touch the wet lips of her pussy. She looked at him with a smile.</p> <p>“Ready?” she asked.</p> <p>“Oh, yeah,” he replied. He felt her lips part and his cock slip inside her. He could no longer hold back.</p> <p>“I didn't think I could fit you inside me,” she laughed.</p> <p>“Oh, I could, if I wanted to,” he said.</p> <p>She reached down and started rubbing his balls with her fingers.</p> <p>He moved up and felt first the wet heat of her pussy as it engulfed his cock. He felt how swollen her breasts were, and she pulled on his hips as he moved in and out. He leaned down, so he could feel the head of his cock on his tongue.</p> <p>“I don’t think we should finish here,” she said. “I want to go at something that I think we liked.”</p> <p>“Sure,” he said. He didn’t want this to end. When she finished, they walked back into the house and he helped her into his room. They were sitting on the bed, still naked, and he held her a little while he stripped her off. He pulled her on top of him, and started kissing her while he held her. His tongue traveled from her mouth and over her chin, and up over her neck. He felt her start to rock against him, and the kiss was short and hot, as their tongues danced with each other.</p> <p>He reached under her, and found her clit. He could feel that it was swollen and swollen and he was eager to put it in his mouth. He held her clit between his thumb and forefinger, but when he rolled it in his finger, she started to gyrate her hips at his hand.</p> <p>“Oh, God,” she whispered, but she didn’t care. She needed his tongue on her clit, and she needed it now. He could feel her pussy getting wetter as she fucked atop him at the head of his cock.</p> <p>’s head, and her pussy. ’s cock. He felt her getting wetter and wetter and wetter. They were together as—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
