English by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </h3><h4>XIX. THE BITE OF THE ADDER.</h4><p><strong>One day had Zarathustra fallen asleep under a fig-tree, owing to the heat, with his arms over his face. And there came an adder and bit him in the neck,</strong> biting him while he'd been asleep. The thought had him getting up and coming to the toilet. He'd never had such an experience with a virgin (in fact, even by his standards), although he'd never met one himself, though he knew there was that girl down the road down the street, one of those porn actresses with the enormous cock that is. He had only once done that in particular though it hadn't been all that bad.</p> <p>When the young man had made the acquaintance of the girl called Zirilla, Zarathustra's mind drifted back to that first moment and how good that memory felt. Though he'd never had such a wild, exciting time with a guy before, and even though he knew that the sex hadn't been great for the woman's enjoyment either, this experience was amazing. He found that she was a beautiful creature with a lovely face and great body. How he wished he could get with her and screw her. They'd be one in the same (especially if it was a woman) and that image was one of his best.</p> <p>He was pretty sure as he stared at Zirilla's body that she'd have a good time with him. There was really no reason to imagine that. He'd fucked her, and it was an awesome experience. There was nothing like that even though the chances there for him to actually do it were slim. And as soon as he'd had that chance with her with that much sexiness, the chances of him fucking her anyway had vanished. He'd had sex with her just the way he liked it, and there was no comparison. Her body was just as good as the woman he loved.</p> <p>Then she'd taken a long sip from her drink and he'd gotten a better look at her. She had an amazing body, long and slim with just a hint of curves and curves like many of the women she looked over. But despite all those curves and curves, she was still incredibly soft. The way she handled herself gave Zarathustra a feeling of confidence and respect, which somehow made it even more powerful for him if she was willing to let him fuck her. Her breasts were so lovely and round and they looked so soft when she laughed, and there was something of a teasing in them which only added to the exotic feel of her naked body as he kissed her breasts.</p> <p>And he really loved her big breasts. They were so much bigger than hers, and they looked even more impressive when her body slapped against his, causing it to hurt. He couldn't stop himself from imagining that she was so happy to be with him and having him take care of her. He was happy for her. He was just a bit sadder because she'd just turned him down.</p> <p>But her body was perfect, and when he was feeling good, he'd really start feeling good. He was feeling good because he'd wanted to fuck her so bad, and here was a reason to love her and feel good for him. Zirilla had never let that happen with him. They'd been too young. Well, they were probably only nineteen. She'd told him that because she wanted him to have the first time with her, and he'd been hesitant to accept that. She just believed in him and that was fine.</p> <p>So he'd thought he'd have a lot of faith in her. He'd always thought of her as too old for him, so he was still afraid that she'd take advantage of this situation. He still worried about getting an erection.</p> <p>But as he thought about her and the way her breasts were soft and just the look in her eyes, he found himself getting aroused. And he could not stop himself from thinking about her. He found himself imagining her naked body on top of him, fucking himself silly on the end of the bed, him leaning over her, kissing her while her face was buried between her legs. He could imagine her on the other bed, too, laying there with her legs spread wide for him, her hands on his back as he fucked her.</p> <p>And then she'd turned him down, and kissed him goodbye, and then kissed him goodbye and finally she'd told him to go down by the village's road. She'd already left on her way to pick up the young man. He couldn't get over it. She was actually a bit more sweet than she was. It was better.</p> <p>They had sex. Then, after he'd fucked her, they'd gone back to the hotel. And he hadn't fucked her, of course not. Zarathustra had just had sex and he'd enjoyed it. He had felt good because he had found the young girl attractive, and so it hadn't hurt. He didn't care about her anymore.</p> <p></p> <p>The whole time was passing through their time was still had been magical. Zarathustrazing. Zarath the moment that his whole.
