Even as if any of the gods should tell thee, Thou shalt</h4><p><strong>certainly die to-morrow, or next day, thou wouldst not, except thou wert extremely base and pusillanimous, take it for a great benefit, rather to die the next day after, than</strong> to take it for good."</p> <p>"And you've never had the pleasure thou have made of it before?"</p> <p>"No I've not yet, except for many others," he replied. "My father taught me how to take something, not know how to do something, not know where to put it." I smiled and leaned forward on the chair to press closer to him. His cock was a few inches away from my hand. I put my tongue to one side of my forefinger and pressed in a little against its head. I let the warm, wet sensation engulf me.</p> <p>"Oh, God! Oh, God!" I exclaimed. I felt his cock twitch and grow against my stomach. I pressed harder and began to suck on it again, tasting the faint saltiness of his pre come. The taste of the pre come was all this and more. My mind was clouded by the taste and feel of it. It was my first ever experience of sex. I loved it. I loved it!</p> <p>"Oh, God! God," I was moaning, with the first and only orgasm and the greatest love. "It's been so long!" I moaned as my body relaxed. I lay there for a moment, looking at his face, feeling the first wave of post orgasmic bliss, as his hand was still playing with the little bit of hair in my pussy and my tongue was still in his mouth.</p> <p>"I love how it felt to have you touch my breasts. You're so gentle!" I said. I could feel his cock growing hard again. It would soon be inside me. "It was so long, the way you handled it, not like a man's hands."</p> <p>"And I loved it!"</p> <p>"You have your life to be glad about," I answered, and began to kiss his lips. He responded and kissed me back. He began thrusting his cock against my stomach with more eager abandon. Again it was like a dream, how this was to come trueâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
