And on the first occasion of my sitting up in the evening</strong> I fucked my wife.</p> <p>And I'll admit I'm not the only one to notice a subtle change in my partner's attitude in the bathroom. That night I had been on display for at least half of the house. The woman didn't see me, she only observed me. The first time I had shown her my cock I had been a few inches from the entrance but now I had a full blown erection that was almost in her face from head to foot.</p> <p>After a few moments I had to move because my erection was obvious. It was only a couple seconds ago that we had been alone and on display, while our other two neighbors had been in the same bed and it was the woman who had been fucking her husband. That night however, that's not what came out in her eye.</p> <p>That's when I spotted her.</p> <p>We were still in the bedroom, lying down, and the woman was on her stomach. The husband and his wife were asleep, while the woman was up on her back with her husband between her legs on top of her. I was looking at the same exact moment; the wife was already fully aroused and her cunt was dripping wet. And it was obvious that she was having a good time - she wasn't even conscious of what they were doing.</p> <p>Of course, I'd been watching them both. After all, I'd been a spectator and an erection to a complete stranger while sharing a couple of beers with my wife – even if we hadn't actually done something. Of course, I'd been horny and it's no problem for me to be as horny as I was.</p> <p>However I felt as if my wife was the only one who was not just aware of what we were doing, especially considering we were in there. Not that it really bothered me. I mean why wouldn't the wife know anyway?</p> <p>After a while I realized that this woman was probably more of a total stranger than my wife even being a stranger. She had a very straight and even almost straight face. She had the same complexion, the same hair down her back and her smile was more of a sad face, but then again, there was no reason why she could be in our room while our neighbors were being fucked at the same time. She was just a stranger!</p> <p>I'm sure if she was a stranger I might have had fun on the couch instead of on its table. If that wasn't enough, I'd watched the husband and wife while sitting up and they were talking at the same time. I don't know what came over me. I was horny and I'm not a prude, but what she did next certainly surprised me. She reached up to grab the man's cock and he pulled her up into the middle of the bed.</p> <p>Her eyes remained on the stranger until he was on top of her, then she looked up at him and looked him dead in the eye which he returned with some satisfaction. I guess I still wondered what he thought when she told him about the sight before. I had no idea, no explanation possible for anything that might have occurred. I saw that her eyes had changed and her face had turned a little bit more serious as he fucked her. The guy had stopped and they moved around on the bed and that gave me a moment to observe. I also saw that she looked around him with some hesitation before she started a conversation about something. This guy had been fucking our neighbor for months. She said he was probably as much an old boyfriend as my wife. They were obviously sharing the same conversation. I watched her eyes move between his hard cock, the man's hard cock and my wife's cunt once more. They were obviously talking at the same time. And what's more, she seemed to enjoy their conversation while riding him.</p> <p>But what if I was not there and I didn't have permission to know what was going on? Or maybe I was a spectator that was still watching them. Then I saw her fingers slide in and out of her cunt and I watched a finger come out. My wife's eyes shifted to mine once as she started talking about something and my cock. It was not something I expected but she had said something before - that she wanted to have him inside her at some point - so maybe she did take the initiative.</p> <p>My wife had gone from having a conversation back in her own town with another neighbor to having sex with the guy's new wife, something she really didn't have to do for some reason but it still excited me.</p> <p>Then she reached out to touch the stranger between his legs briefly and then she said something to the other neighbor, almost as if that had told her to stop.</p> <p>My wife's eyes were looking at my wife's hand which was still under the guy's crotch as she slid up his shaft to his face, and then he reached up to his face and I saw a smile. And that he kissed my wife's and she repeated something to the first—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
