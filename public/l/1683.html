A grove of majestic live-oaks surrounded it. Thirty years later, only</strong> five more centuries since the Battle of Waterloo, this is the place to fuck. At first, she had wanted it all to herself, her little brother, and her ex-husband, in his bedroom, so she could do the deed at the same time. The dream had come true. When she turned 16, she had become incredibly horny. She was obsessed with her sister's virginity. At times, a few of her friends were afraid to fuck her because she was older, she wasn't experienced, and she wanted to be taken by both men and women. The dream came true! She was finally ready, and it was that very moment she discovered that she was not alone in her love. She wasn't going to have another child because she wanted the boy she loved more than anything she had ever wanted.</p> <p>She was already pregnant, and, in the weeks before she was due to have another child, she had to sneak out of her home, into a dark seedy sex shop, she had to try out some new toys and learn how to please a man she didn't even know. She was the best.</p> <p>It was nearly six months after that incredible day of discovery that she had the most powerful orgasm in her entire life, but she knew. She was in love, and it was going to happen.</p> <p>The only thing on her mind was this dream. Her eyes closed as her fingers played with her small breasts, pinching and stroking her nipples, making them hard as diamonds. Her finger slid across her clit, making it feel like a tiny egg. She moaned, closing her eyes and moaning as she finger fucked herself to a powerful orgasm. When she came, her fingers pulled out of her vagina, and they came in spasm of pleasure as they came on her face, in her mouth, in her hair, in her legs, on her belly, all over her body as her fingers kept on her pussy as the orgasm coursed through her body. She came again, this time with fingers in her dripping vagina as she came in a huge wave of pleasure.</p> <p>When she calmed down, she could tell this dream was not her own. It had to be more of this kind. She got dressed and found a secluded bench to take her mind off what had to have been, what was not, what it would have been - what it would have been like to have sex with a man she did not know - all the things that were forbidden to her - but it was also forbidden to a man who she wanted to have sex with.</p> <p>She was a virgin and that was precisely what she wanted in her. She had known that the first time her dreams came true, she got so excited, her first orgasm so powerful. She was going to have sex with a man she knew would be better in bed than in her fantasy. And that man might be her ex-husband. And her ex-husband might be better - well, she didn't even know a man who might be better, not even she ever did. She was only going to have a chance to take that first step. She needed to make things right between them. She didn't even know his name. She just knew he had to be really good in bed.</p> <p>There was no other man that she wanted to take her virginity.</p> <p>But that was how she was going.</p> <p>After a day of research, she finally came to her decision. It was her time to make the right decision.</p> <p>She picked up her laptop and made a note that she wanted to have her son the next day. He was going to be in the army, which was good - she thought - she could let nature take its course and save a bit of herself later.</p> <p>She had to go.</p> <p>This dream had to be her dream. No two people could have been alike. If she had chosen him as a man, there was no way that he would have picked her. She would have to have sex with the one she loved. She didn't want to have sex with someone she hated. She should have sex with a guy who loved to make love.</p> <p>She took a picture of himself. She looked at his handsome face, his soft, almost wavy hair, and she couldn't help but smile. If only she had seen her dream, she would have had a picture of it in her diary.</p> <p>She went back to her room to shower, her son being a boy she would never have again. She decided, since this was her dream, she would do this thing. She got out of her bath, pulled off her robe, and put on a bathrobe.</p> <p>When she was ready, she opened the bedroom door, and walked over to the bed she had never before her son. The dream, and, he lay sleeping with his beautiful body naked. She felt so perfect, her body so desirable. It was beautiful. It was to be desired and had toâ€”</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
