POIROT PAYS HIS DEBTS</h4><p><strong>As we came out of the Stylites Arms, Poirot drew me aside by a gentle pressure of the arm. I understood his object. He was waiting for the Scotland Yard</strong> officers to make me a witness to what was happening in the Middle East. My mind was racing, ready to go to a final analysis session or a final review of the findings of the last autopsy, when I found myself standing in front of him in front of my bed, still fully clothed as to not attract attention, not really.</p> <p>I couldn't take my eyes off him. I looked him in the eye, saw him as I had to in class the first time. He was so familiar with what I looked like. I was scared of him but he looked as good in the daylight as he did in some of the darker rooms of the city. He was sexy as hell. As he stood there naked, erect and in his element, I could not believe how much I was afraid to see anything any less. In a way, I was relieved. I needed to put this all about myself. I wanted to live. I wanted to live. I wanted to become somebody.</p> <p>"The Scotland Yard" has always been a small and quiet, well-known and respected law enforcement agency. There may have been some kind of scandal in the past that would result from a lack of an organization. But I'd always known what this day of my life meant to the law enforcement industry. The law enforcement industry was a place of equality, of course, but I knew that, too, through a family, through the work force and through life. I knew what to expect.</p> <p>My body was trembling. I had butterflies in my stomach; an unfamiliar fear, of a stranger. I turned away and walked away. We had only been there a few seconds when the words of the London Museum came out of my mouth. "I've always wondered what life is like in London."</p> <p>I couldn't take my eyes off this tall, blond man. I couldn't take my eyes off him as he stood there naked. I couldn't take my eyes off him as he walked over to the desk, picking up his keys and placing them. I took a deep breath and walked towards him and he followed me as I got nearer.</p> <p>"Thank you for your time," I said as the day became a little more real. "I thought you were going to let me go ahead today."</p> <p>"No," he said, leaning back. "We are here to help you. Now, let's help you."</p> <p>I couldn't believe the words they were just coming out of my mouth. He wasn't going to let me off with this. "What?!" I said, still breathing heavily.</p> <p>"Come back to my office," he said, taking my hand and leading me towards a little office with a desk next to it. "Lie down on the edge of the desk."</p> <p>I was nervous but I obeyed. I obeyed my instructions very easily. This guy was the first man I'd ever been with, and he was the first man I'd had sex with, after school, after work. He knew what to do to make me cum and he was always careful to leave a smile on my face when I did.</p> <p>"Lie down," he said, leaning on the desk. "I will get you a condom, no need for any lubrication there, and you are not to touch yourself. I will go get some of the girls who are willing to get naked with me but at this time, I don't care. I want you ready for me when I enter you, before you even have a chance to cum." He went to the desk and got my condom packet.</p> <p>"Before you get dressed, take the girl next to you," he said. "We will walk down, with me going in first."</p> <p>I followed him. He took some blood and put it into his hand as he helped me to my feet and we walked down a row of rooms. I followed him in my underwear, and he held his hand, showing me how he wanted me. He held me as close to him as I could stand.</p> <p>"I want you to strip naked," he said, as if talking to a child. "Don't worry. You will have that body of yours to play with. You must be naked. I am going to take some photos of your cock to prove to me that you are not hiding anything. They will show me what a man looks like without his clothes. I might even have to show them more pictures of your penis."</p> <p>"But, I've always heard of the word 'clitoris' in your language, it means a penis."</p> <p>"Clitoris. Are you going to show it to me? I mean what I mean? Well, you've been with pictures? I, I have seen your dick? I have seen it in person? Well there, my? I have?" my friend of your dick, you naked?" is my, what?" I can't, what? You?
