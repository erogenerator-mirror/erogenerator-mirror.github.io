In their words, the letter was a parting gift that they couldn't possibly bear. But then, when the Russian Federation insisted she was his girl, their first girl together. She couldn't have been more beautiful. And after all…</p> <p>I guess you'd think it was just a silly prank on her that they were throwing, since she wanted to go out on a date with us. But they are really quite serious. I was in a very expensive restaurant, and the waitress was rather good. And I had to sit with my legs crossed. You might think of me as a kind of chauvinist…but, yes, you definitely noticed I'd left my shoes on…</p> <p>Our dinner was nice, and it was the best time of my life. We talked about lots of things, and when the time came to call her name, I was quite nervous about going on another date. I mean, I had a date…and it would mean that she would really go for me…but she wasn't going for me…and our evening was starting out a little awkward for me…</p> <p>We didn't discuss this particular night, though. I think she would have preferred me to just go on a date. It would be fun…and she wouldn't feel obligated…since she was going for me.</p> <p>After dinner, when we wanted to get up to go to bed, we sat talking and planning our future…and then, after a while, she started talking, too.</p> <p>"I'm not sure if I can go on a date with you again," she said.</p> <p>I smiled. "It sounds great," I said, and, when she wasn't looking, I kissed her cheek.</p> <p>"Really?" she asked, and, after a moment, "And it still sounds great to me," she said, giving me a dazzling smile.</p> <p>When we got to bed, I had this wonderful, wonderful night.</p> <p>But, now it was going to be different. It might be embarrassing for me to do it, but for her…and it really was not.</p> <p>She was the most sensuous person I had ever experienced and—she was so beautiful!! And she was even more desirable than she was looking right now. I was in a daze, completely overwhelmed by the most powerful and powerful feelings of lust I had ever encountered. Her lips were so soft and she smelled so incredibly delicious.</p> <p>We were quiet during the entire evening, as we tried to determine exactly what to do…or say…while we undressed each other. She slipped her hand from my breast to hold my face so that I could kiss her again. And then she did something I've never done with anyone before, something she had never done with anyone before. She kissed my mouth…and my tongue. She broke off, kissing my throat, and down the line of my chest…</p> <p>I gasped when she stopped there, kissing my belly. I was naked before she could even get my panties off. And I was on the verge of begging her to do it again, but she didn't seem too bothered at all. Instead, she just leaned up on her knees and pulled me on top of her. And she put her hands on my back and started pulling me against her.</p> <p>Now, I love how aggressive she is at this moment—just as she always has been, and I do love kissing her as much as she loves sucking mine. But right now, I felt very neglected, and, instead of taking it out on her, I ran my hands up and down her thighs while I kissed her. I kissed her face, eyelids and eyes, before kissing the tip of her nose. I kissed and licked her jawbone, and her neck, licking and nibbling at each and every inch of her exposed skin.</p> <p>By now I was naked, but she'd already removed my dress from around my waist once we were naked. Then, before she had me into my arms, she had me inside her, pumping into her like she had never done before—the hottest fuck I have ever experienced. And she moaned for me to fuck her harder, even though she'd never been done that way, and she never seemed to mind in any case.</p> <p>I don't know where I got it from (I'd had to leave the house for an interview—I was on a pay-per-night contract with a large company—and my boss didn't know I liked the work…but he was a nice guy and he knew the stuff). But, I certainly understand—I'm a bit of a voyeur. Andy, but I'm passionate.</p> <p></p> <p>She started fucking me deeper and didn't have never slowed, and now. And I could come faster, but then had, faster then me, had my own everytime for once in my other women. I wanted again—</p> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
