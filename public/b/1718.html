Hey, what's going on?"</p> <p>"They have been meeting guys for a while now and the guys all agreed to some kinda arrangement."</p> <p>"What the hell happened with the guys?"</p> <p>He knew his man was a bit of a hypocrite, and not only that, he had had a couple problems that he knew could become problems. She couldn't remember the last time that she had a good time, and it was getting time to end it and the new guy who was getting her away.</p> <p>"Nothing much."</p> <p>"Hey, I saw the way that you were hanging on to your man. I guess he wanted more than you knew. Now I bet that there weren't any other guys in the room who would make that kind of trouble for you, can't say that my wife knew that he was doing her a favor."</p> <p>It made perfect sense! This was all his old friend with new guy. Now this man was talking about doing a favor for his friend. He really liked Tom, he had talked to Tom some time ago and had gotten on with his wife. Then he started to leave.</p> <p>He looked up and saw that his friend was gone, then he saw another guy coming over. He saw his friend get up and come over; he was smiling at him too and he noticed the smile coming back to him.</p> <p>"Hi, I'm Tony."</p> <p>"Well hello my friend, that's Tom right! Where are you staying tonight?"</p> <p>"Just on the beach my friend. I thought that I would go to the hotel before I go home."</p> <p>"Nah, I want to have some fun, I am not interested in a fuck on the beach."</p> <p>"Yeah you would be too for the bar tonight, if you have a good time with us."</p> <p>"Nah, I will be good. I really want to go for a drink with your friends."</p> <p>"Yeah, sure I am cool with that. We can go ahead and watch the game."</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess that would be fine. I still want that hot wife of yours."</p> <p>"Yeah, no worries about that Tony. Let's go!"</p> <p>He took all his clothes off and got down on the sand. He was naked, so he went right down to the ocean. The two men went on out and got some beers and sat on the chairs on the beach. He saw that one of the guys had his hand around Tom's wife's hand and that both of them had a look on their face that he was probably going to give him a blow job. That was enough to set the tone to his evening.</p> <p>When the guys got back to the table they found Tony and Tom sitting on each of their chairs talking and giggling.</p> <p>"Hey, man, you sure are back and what's your name?"</p> <p>"Tommy, this is Tommy, Tom, and I'm Tony."</p> <p>Tom put his arm around Tony's neck and they both smiled at each other. Tony had his hand on the back of Tony's neck and squeezed the muscle there.</p> <p>"Sorry, I just had to make sure that you were okay with his situation."</p> <p>"It's okay with me, I am still going out with my new buddy."</p> <p>He then gave Tony a kiss on the cheek and walked away so that he wouldn't embarrass them.</p> <p>"Come on Tommy, I'll show you the way to your room, come on!"</p> <p>Tom stood up and they walked out to the beach and sat down on it.</p> <p>"So what is your name?"</p> <p>"Tony, Tony"</p> <p>"So you are a nudist? I'll be interested in meeting you and letting you know about the trip."</p> <p>"Yeah, I think that I want to go to some nude beaches tomorrow."</p> <p>"That will be fine Tony, I will send the group for you tomorrow."</p> <p>"You don't have to do it, it's fine. Come on, let's go."</p> <p>Tony and Tom were laughing at everything that they said to each other and trying to keep up with the people at the resort, so that they wouldn't embarrass them if they did it in public, but they wouldn't let Tony embarrass them again. And neither would Tom.</p> <p>The guys were going along with it when they got back to the hotel after showering and changing their clothes. After the showers they were getting into the bed and it really wasn't so much a turn-on for them that Tom and Tony would be getting in the bed next to each other. That's why they were there when the guys came in the door.</p> <p>"What are you two playing at?" asked Tom</p> <p>"Nothing, we're friends."</p> <p>Tony chuckled "We just want to get you alone.
