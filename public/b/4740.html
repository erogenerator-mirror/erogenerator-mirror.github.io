When I arrived back at the locker room after lunch I sat on the toilet for a bit before I got changed.</p> <p>A moment later I was on my hands and knees as I was asked to kneel. My trainer walked into the washroom and came over to me as I knelt in front of him.</p> <p>"Good morning," he greeted me with a grin, "how are you this morning, John?"</p> <p>"I'm good," I laughed, "so happy to be here."</p> <p>"John, I really want to thank you for helping out, but I'm going to cut my time here short," he told me to hold on.</p> <p>My heart started to jump again in my chest.</p> <p>"No, you go ahead and join in the fun. Take a seat."</p> <p>He smiled as he walked back to the locker room.</p> <p>The rest of the day was pretty uneventful as we finished our workout and got into the running room, both of us in suits with our shirts in our laps. As I watched him as he turned the shower on, I noticed he was doing his upper body exercises. I guessed his abs looked ripped, his waist was almost flat, his hips looked thick and he wasn't looking at anything that was clearly defined.</p> <p>"I see the gym has you in the mix, huh?" I wondered out loud.</p> <p>"Uh, yeah it does," he said as his eyes continued down toward his mid section. "It looks like you just finished a couple of hours with the gym. What a difference a day makes in a workout."</p> <p>I shook my head as he took his shirt off before he wrapped a towel around his waist. I looked up and he wasn't looking at his face, he was looking at my body through the mirror on the wall.</p> <p>"Let's go see how it's doing up there," I said to him as he started to go into the shower.</p> <p>"I'm all done up for the day," he said to me as he stepped back into the shower.</p> <p>"Good, you're not through yet."</p> <p>"Not yet," he said with a smile.</p> <p>We finished showering and as he stepped out of the shower, I noticed he was pulling the towel back toward me and I had to look away from what I was doing. He put one hip on the towel before he stepped in the shower with me. I saw something that turned my eyes to his cock as he washed himself, it was getting erect again, he turned to me and with that he stepped down from the shower.</p> <p>I felt myself starting to perspire because I couldn't breathe as he soaped me up. He pulled me to him and we kissed for a bit, but after I broke our kiss, I got his hands in mine and we continued up his body. My hands started to make their way to his chest. We continued to kiss as I unbuttoned his shirt while he looked back at me and pulled it over his head.</p> <p>We washed each other, and with one hand caressing his chest while the other ran down his body, I was on my knees as his hands went to my head and he started to wash my hair. His fingers worked a lot of shampoo into the scalp, but each time I moved back to his skin, he would wash his hair, which he did frequently.</p> <p>After my hair was squeaky clean and wet, I worked his chest and stomach and he worked shampoo into my shoulders and up to my neck. I worked down his toned thighs and he worked shampoo from my own hair. Once he was rinsed, I turned his torso toward the shower and ran his hands back up to my neck and started to shampoo each other.</p> <p>"John, do u wanna do it again?" I asked him as he started to move toward me.</p> <p>"I'd love to, but I have to get back to my workout this morning so I'll shower later," he replied as he took a step back from me.</p> <p>I leaned down and kissed him on the lips before I got up and started walking toward the other room. He followed me and I caught his hand as we walked. His cock was hard already as he followed me.</p> <p>As we reached the bathroom, he turned the shower off with a groan, "ohh, yessss," he groaned.</p> <p>I closed the door and turned around to kiss him. His tongue slid into my mouth and he tasted of soap. He slowly ran his hands down my neck and arms and I let him do this for a few seconds before I pulled away.</p> <p>"No, don't do thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
