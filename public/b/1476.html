I'm not ready."</p> <p>"No, not really."</p> <p>She took a deep breath and exhaled. "I don't have your cock and I don't think I'm ready to let you fuck me. Do you understand?"</p> <p>"So I can really go at it?"</p> <p>"Oh yes, I will."</p> <p>She opened her eyes a long time but when they locked with mine she kissed me again and we rolled over to my side. I was now on my back and her legs spread wide open to show me the pink folds of her pussy.</p> <p>"Do you really like what you see?"</p> <p>"What, do I really like it?"</p> <p>She smiled and smiled that same smile and moved in closer to my cock and rubbed her nipple, and then kissed the head several times. When I did not say a word she pushed her pussy back over my erection, and leaned over to give me a wet kiss. I loved watching this close up.</p> <p>She leaned in and rubbed her tongue across the head then licked it. She licked and licked again. When she licked my head she sucked in on my cockhead and licked and sucked even more. She licked the hole, which looked so much better on a girl's face, and took the head inside her mouth, as far as she could take it.</p> <p>"Oh God yes, that feels soooo good." She held it in her mouth as long as she could, but she was almost ready to come. She had no problem taking its length inside her mouth. She could only take about five to ten inches.</p> <p>She wanted to show me that she could take much more, and that she liked being able to handle it. To do it she had to get me ready. She wanted to make it last.</p> <p>She had me lean against a tree out behind her, lifted her hips just enough to push down onto my cock, then lowered herself a bit and felt my cock penetrate just a bit higher into her. She sat up, as she always did, and we kissed again a bit. She kissed from my chin and lips down to my neck, and when my hands came in contact with her beautiful breasts she let out a gasp. We kissed a bit more, and my fingers came in contact with her nipple again. She leaned back a bit and I lifted her to my chest, again.</p> <p>As we moved and moved each other I was kissing and licking her nipple. As I had always done here with girls, I felt her tongue on my face and ears. I moved to her other nipple, and was licking her from just below my ear to just above. I could feel the tip of her tongue touching my nipple. I kissed her breasts again and then ran my hand down to the bottom of her thigh and across her pussy lips. Then I slid my finger down a long, and almost painful way to her clit, just under where her clit was. She made her hips move and I stopped kissing and licking her.</p> <p>"My god, that's amazing."</p> <p>I kept moving down between her legs, but then she turned around and we kissed again for a long time. "I love you."</p> <p>"And I love you."</p> <p>She kissed me again. "You're so big. I feel like I am going to tear apart. You're going to take me like the Fourth of July in just this one night."</p> <p>"I can't believe we have this much control in bed."</p> <p>"Hmmm."</p> <p>"I do not want to break it for you."</p> <p>"Are you worried about it."</p> <p>"Don't you worry if its not the sex?"</p> <p>"No I am not worried. We could just take it easy for a while."</p> <p>"I didn't say that."</p> <p>"Well we'll just have to be patient. I love you."</p> <p>I held her in my arms. "I love you too and I hope this doesn't change anything between us."</p> <p>"Okay, now let me get to you." I rolled her over and straddled her hips. Slowly I moved the head of my cock down past her pussy and up toward her clit. As I pulled back slightly as I looked in her right at her, I kissed her again. Then I rubbed my finger against her opening but just on the very end of her clit, and she made a sound like "Oh, yes" and her tongue came out to lick my lips.</p> <p>"God that feels so good."</p> <p>"I told you it was good."</p> <p>"You didn't have to do that but I like being your girl. It feels so good."</p> <p>"Yeahâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
