This was true, but still. "Nothing is better than what the past couple hours have done to me. I think it would be good if you kept touching me, touching me, and kissing me until we both can't do any more."</p> <p>There was an air of finality in my voice as I spoke. I was still lying on my back with a manly, masculine hand under my blouse. I didn't know how to react, what would happen, or whom was doing it. It's difficult not to feel the truth, to admit it or reject the truth. It's better to be honest and not hiding the truth. It's better for the subject to be buried inside a self conscious set of feelings and fears.</p> <p>"Please," I finally spoke, "I don't have to go without for what ever happens next. I really can't say that I'm gay."</p> <p>"Of course you don't, we're not going to hurt you or get hurt. It would be our first time to do it, but, if you feel the need for it, there's my room over there right next to the door." I pointed. "It's the most secluded room we have."</p> <p>His eyes grew warm and bright as they looked at me. "And I won't be in here," he said as he sat up in his bed. "I don't know if I can keep up this constant erection, even if it's hard at first. I don't know if I could even keep going without help."</p> <p>"We could always stop, go to the bathroom," I smiled as I turned from him, stood and left the room, leaving the door slightly ajar.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>I could still feel myself, but, now feeling more vulnerable and vulnerable, I decided to stop. I turned to face him, and I slowly unbuttoned my shirt, leaving it to hang open. My breasts were covered and very sensitive. I removed the shirt and threw it on the floor beside his bed, my hands on my sides.</p> <p>"What's this, David?"</p> <p>"Don't do this."</p> <p>"Sorry. I should have known. No rush. I'm on an all too familiar path to this place." The words didn't seem to make it any easier.</p> <p>I slid the blouse off and tossed it aside. I unbuttoned my jeans and kicked them off, too. When I got to the waistline of my shorts I hesitated, and looked down. I felt my cock getting hard and then my panties growing moist. My cock was about to explode, the feeling was exhilarating. I reached around to remove my bra, pulling off my panties while I sat on my bed. Now wearing nothing but my socks and shoes I was naked except for the boxers.</p> <p>"Why are you doing this?"</p> <p>"For you. For our first time," I admitted as I sat on my bed.</p> <p>"I'm not doing this alone."</p> <p>I nodded. "We must be. You have me so scared right now. Please don't try and put that up there."</p> <p>He didn't need a second thought. He looked at me without moving. "You know you want it, don't you?"</p> <p>I nodded. "Yes."</p> <p>"I'm getting turned on," he said. "I can feel it. And, I'm going to make sure you can feel it. Take off the rest of the clothes."</p> <p>I took a step toward him, but he grabbed my wrist and kept me at arms length. "Wait!" I gasped. "Just... just, this once. Please." His voice grew soft.</p> <p>I looked into his eyes, searching for any hint of what he was thinking, what he wanted to say. He was not going to hurt me, but, I'm sure, he could see that. I looked back at his eyes, not understanding what they were saying. He was going to have sex with another man as he had said he would.</p> <p>"You know," he started, "I like you."</p> <p>"No. Really?"</p> <p>He nodded. "If you'll let me. If you'll let me touch you."</p> <p>There was still a look of doubt in his eyes, but, at the same time, a look of love and lust filled lust. My heart ached when he let go of my hand and reached out to me. His hand reached between my legs and he rubbed his hand lightly against my cock. It surged with blood as I felt it.</p> <p>"You already told me it would be okay, I just meant to take it slow to make you feel better," he smiled, hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
