But the women who took their orders told the men to stand up. They could see the bulge in some of the men's pants.</p> <p>The girls started to giggle again. I didn't know what to do. I looked all around the room and there were so many people there I felt like just sitting there. When I tried to move I couldn't, to say anything.</p> <p>I heard one of the girls tell the whole room to sit down. The woman in charge said, "Don't you be getting the impression that you are a little excited?" Then she told us to stand up right next to their chair.</p> <p>That got us all laughing! When we did they went to the next person in line, and we both looked so happy! We could hear them talking and laughing and then they came to the next woman in line. She had a huge grin on her face and it made me turn red with embarrassment.</p> <p>But then the woman started to laugh too which made me turn bright red too!</p> <p>The man in charge of the room laughed so much that a couple of people in the audience got up to follow the woman in front of me.</p> <p>The women giggled, then started to play.</p> <p>But then there was a sudden crack at the door and then there was silence. I was stunned! The woman came back to the front of us and said that I should call for my boss. That brought us into the audience and I guess we both wanted to tell someone what was in that room and then we laughed at the poor faces we saw!</p> <p>The man in charge of the audience laughed at those faces, then finally said, "We are now the women!"</p> <p>The crowd cheered and even some men started to laugh at their faces too. But then we heard the woman's voice again. "I love this show, so I'm going to enjoy it even more!"</p> <p>The man in charge of the audience laughed at me again, then said, "You have done well for yourself today I suppose. So please stand up! Don't be embarrassed!"</p> <p>Then he pulled the man who was holding the woman to him and started to kiss her! She was very excited. He kissed her on her mouth for a while, then he started to French kiss her as well. Their mouths were open, their kissing was making me dizzy!</p> <p>I looked around. I don't think the rest of the room could see what I was seeing. I could tell that it was too much to see in the dark! As the woman reached down to her lap, her skirt was bunched up around her knees, and she was rubbing her legs a little. She looked at me and smiled. "So you like your show, don't you?" She asked.</p> <p>"Oh my God! Yes! Oh my God, yes!" I thought to my self.</p> <p>Then she leaned on his shoulder and whispered, "I loved it! I've wanted this for years!"</p> <p>"Do you have something for me," he asked.</p> <p>"Anything with you," she said.</p> <p>"And, I'm afraid there are panties around here somewhere." He said.</p> <p>"No! I like them, but let me just get my panties and put them on then we won't be embarrassed." But she just laughed.</p> <p>"Well, you can get some more on if you like." She told him.</p> <p>"Thanks! But let me put mine on first!" He said.</p> <p>He stood up and started to put his pants back on. But he stopped, and reached down to take her hand. She looked at me and then she leaned back to her chair and put her panties on too. He walked to my little table and got the panties and put them on.</p> <p>Then he came close to me, put his arms around my waist and kissed me. Then he looked at me and said, "Your turn again."</p> <p>I turned my face away, and he grabbed more clothes and started to get dressed again. Then he took the panties from me and walked to the door and he said, "I see you've brought your panties in your hands and now I'll just put yours on too!"</p> <p>I felt my face get red with embarrassment. He grabbed my other panties, and put them in his pocket. He walked behind me and told me to try to concentrate on the woman's applause. He walked me along with him and back to the auditorium. He wanted to see how it went.</p> <p>They were the most beautiful women there! They seemed to have everything all by themselves, and when we returned to the first row the next girl had her chair back!
