"But what about us? Will you be my only one, for long enough to make it all happen?" Her smile was bright enough to light the room for all of them to see. She leaned over and kissed him deeply again. His hands cupped her face as he lifted her into his arms. She wrapped her arms about his neck as much as possible, leaning over to give him access to her neck. He took her face in his hands and kissed it once again. She closed her eyes and let out a sigh as he bit her lightly. His hand rubbed her cheek as he pulled her hair away. Then he took one of her breasts in his hand and cupped it in his hand, rolling her nipple between his thumb and index finger. He could feel it hardening through her clothing and into his touch. She didn't resist and as he took her breast out of his hands he bent down to suck on her other nipple. The soft, moist lips on her neck and earlobe soon made the young couple lose themselves in a rush of lust.</p> <p>Her kiss became more passionate as he took charge. Her legs went around his back and her body quivered as she neared orgasm. He pulled up her shirt and began to caress and suck her breasts. His hands squeezed and explored her torso. He kissed her breasts once more and felt their weight. He pulled up her shirt, taking in her gorgeous breasts. He began to kiss her nipples once more. The warm sun felt so good on her pale skin. Her hands went to his head, caressing it as she let out a moan. He began to kiss her breasts again, teasingly. She felt his tongue start to flick over the tip of her breasts. He sucked her nipple deeply into his mouth and began to flick his tongue back and forth across it.</p> <p>"Ohhhh!" she cooed, taking in his kisses. His lips moved down her body and continued until she felt him take her shorts off. She smiled in contentment as he slowly pulled down her shorts.</p> <p>"No," she whispered as she pulled her shirt up. "Put me down here." He pulled them down her legs as she helped him out of his shirt. Once she was naked, she looked at him like he was the god of the sea. "Kneel." She smiled. He knelt in front of her and put her in his arms. She felt his body pressing tightly against her. She kissed his chest, running her hands through his hair and kissed his neck.</p> <p>"I do love you," she said against his cheek as he ran his hands down her body. When he reached her hips he pulled her toward him. Her legs went around his body and her feet locked over his hips. He could feel her heat and wetness as she began to grind against him.</p> <p>"Oh yes...that is what this is for," she moaned into his skin. He could feel her heart beating beneath his hand.</p> <p>He pulled away from her, leaving her panting for breath. With one hand he pulled her body away from his, and his other hand slid up her body to her waist, where he began to slide it back down to her hip. He stopped again as he slid the hand beneath her skirt, feeling the heat of her flesh, as he wrapped his fingers around the cloth of her panties. The fabric was smooth and soft. She spread her legs for him, urging him back against her. As their body's came together he felt it build until it seemed like it could not get close to coming.</p> <p>"No," she said as he pulled away. She lifted her legs up to him, feeling him inside of her now. She slid her heels off as her arms went around his neck. He could feel her legs against his hardness.</p> <p>"Yes," she whispered against his lips. "Take me...please." She began to arch her hips upward as he took his hands and put her hands on his shoulders. He slowly eased up her body until his hardon rested between her legs and nestled between them.</p> <p>"Yes," he said as he ran his hand along the front of her. "Take me," he said as he slowly rocked his hips.</p> <p>She placed her hands on his back, pulling him into her as she let out a whimper. He held himself steady until she stopped him. His hands gently caressed her bottom as she lifted her hips again. She arched into his touch.</p> <p>"My sweet, sweet, beautiful little girl," she said as she ran her fingertips across his lower back, the backs of her fingers on his skin.</p> <p>He was so close now that he could barely control himself. She took his hand in hers and guided it back to her. He placed his fingers under her bottom and began to lift.
