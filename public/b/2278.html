As my cock grows harder at the prospect of seeing my hot wife with a stranger. I've long had fantasies of doing a sexual thing with a woman and, if a woman were to get her hands on me, I probably would have enjoyed it as much as she got hers. I mean, why would I do that if its my own wife that I was fantasizing about? I hope we can finish this here, and then let go. This is all so wrong, I can't be sure that she will want to do ANYTHING with me. Oh, well... maybe.</p> <p>Once I get this out of my head I feel a hand on my cock through the shorts I'm wearing. I look over the top of the blanket and see that my wife has stopped caressing me for an instant. The second hand on my cock is now sliding up and down, teasing me, and, I look down and see a look of wonderment cross her face as she sees how turned on I am. She then leans forward and plants another kiss on my lips before pulling away. She gives me this look, and then kisses me again. She pulls away and continues stroking me. "That's it, take off your shirt. Let the girls see you, maybe we'll even let them join in."</p> <p>As I'm not quite sure what I can do, I don't really mind stripping off my shirt. I just stand there as if I'm still a child, and try to think of anything else to stop the moment of my nudeness. I manage to pull off my own shirt and throw it over onto the blanket. Next, I stand there in my boxers, feeling very embarrassed as my member has gotten rock hard. I take a deep breath, and think that I could still make myself cum just by standing there. I decide to try and help out whatever the three of them can manage to do, and do so quickly.</p> <p>"Well, that looks good, isn't it? You're still hard, too! Well look on the desk, then." The two girls that I know look at it and then look away and start to walk away. I stand there for a minute in shock of their actions, not sure what to think. What did I just do? How did I just go off like that? I start to get a sick feeling in my stomach as I try to figure out what the hell is going on here.</p> <p>"Oh, come on. We're only helping." The girl's voice calls out to me. I start to get a nervous feeling in my stomach at the possibility of being turned on by watching these three attractive women undress in front of me. I start to rub myself slowly, wondering if I should just go now, or wait for another opportunity. I slowly turn my attention back to the monitor, hoping there won't be more girls to see me naked this time.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"What's up, Tim!" The blonde's voice snaps me from my daze. "How do girls know what to do?"</p> <p>"Do you always agree with one, Tim?" My wife's friend asks. "It's usually one of them that tells you what to do and can move on."</p> <p>"Oh, sorry. Can I ask you something?" I ask. "Do you always agree to be naked?"</p> <p>"And what's this?" The one that's speaking to me turns around to look at me. She has a mischievous grin, and a gleam in her eyes that makes my blood boil. "Just an observation of what you agreed to do." She asks. "You had to do it, and you agreed. I know you have this rule about being naked in front of girls, but I didn't think we agreed to do that."</p> <p>I'm a little flabbergasted this time, but at this point I'm not quite so sure about the rule. "Well, at least that, and I was going to be naked, but, we never agreed." I finally say, trying to put the ball in what the girl said. This must be where our agreement comes in.</p> <p>"Well, I figured the rules had to be written. If there was more than one naked man here, then you must have it." My wife's friend says. Then, "Well, I'm glad to get along with you. I don't really know of what you're getting ready to do, but I'm willing to bet there's no one else in the world I'd give my life for." The blonde's name comes to mind. "What are you getting away with if I were standing here in just my boxers, instead of you getting naked and having the chance to do whatever you want, you know?"</p> <p>"No." My wife's friend answers.
