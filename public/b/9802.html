And all the while, I couldn’t help but smile. He slipped me the top and I laid it on the bed beside him. I felt his hardness against my thigh and I reached down to squeeze it. It felt marvelous. I pulled on his hand and placed it on my breast. At this point, I knew that I had to have it. I wanted to feel my husband’s cock deep inside me. But I was afraid, not of what the size might be, but I wasn’t sure I would be able to take it.</p> <p>As we lay facing each other, I felt my heart pounding and my skin tingling in passion. And when I looked into his eyes, I saw that they were as hard as they were long. Then, as a man and woman, we kissed. Our tongues wrestled with each other for long moments. And we came to a decision. We would either do this or end this. It was too late, and I realized that my life had been gone and I couldn’t bear for anything else to happen. I was not sure that I could face him again.</p> <p>“I’m sorry,” I whimpered, “I can’t. I can’t do this anymore.”</p> <p>“You don’t have to,” he said gently. “I understand.”</p> <p>He kissed me. It felt wonderful. It felt wonderful because the desire to have and be with him was still there, still with him. And it felt good because I had him to be mine.</p> <p>“I want this,” I said in a voice that was soft even to him, “to feel you in my hand.”</p> <p>It took a moment for him to regain his composure. “Are you sure,” he asked.</p> <p>“It feels as good as I’ve imagined it would.” I replied. “If you were to come tonight when you did, it wouldn’t come as bad as I had hoped.”</p> <p>He nodded his head, “Just be careful.”</p> <p>And with that, I slipped out of the bed and took off my robe. While I was taking off my panties, he got up to follow me. We stood there in the moonlight the entire time. He couldn’t believe that I was naked and standing beside him. His eyes were glued to my body. I felt a little self-conscious, but I didn’t care. I knew that the night was young. And even if the moon was as beautiful as the stars, I didn’t want to take my robe off in front of him again. He felt it too, and he followed me to his bedroom.</p> <p>We lay together on the bed. The moonlight danced in his eyes as he began to stroke my belly and move on me. I felt that I was becoming aroused again, but I didn’t stop him. I pulled him closer to me and let his hardness press against me. I wanted him again. I knew it and I knew it right away. And I knew that I would continue this for as long as I could.</p> <p>He rolled me onto my back and moved down to kiss me. Our tongues were exploring each other as deep as they could go. I knew that we had a lot of time to enjoy this. I felt that passion building again and knew what it was. We did for the longest time. It was like an all-consuming passion that each of us could not control. It started at the first hint of his tongue and raced toward the heartthrob of me.</p> <p>It was no time at all before I felt him parting the lips with his fingers and tasting me. He probed me with a finger then slid that up and inside me. The feeling of his fingers was exquisite, and so was the pressure of his tongue on the lips of my vagina. And I came quickly to the next stage of the experience.</p> <p>He didn’t have to do much to bring me to the brink, but he was relentless in his endeavours. He pulled back just before I came, then moved back in a fraction of a second until I felt him push at me again.</p> <p>My legs spread wider for him, taking his full hardness inside me. My arms tightened around his neck and I felt both the—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
