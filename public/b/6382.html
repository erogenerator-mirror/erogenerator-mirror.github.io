My hand squeezes and massages the other. I hear and feel you moan and whimper in pleasure as my mouth works on your other breast. My lips slowly move down your chest and as they are on your chest I taste you, I hear you suck in your breath but don't let it out as my tongue continues to explore as my lips continue to pleasure your hard nipples and to lick the area around the dark flesh at the base of your chest. I hear you gasp in pleasure and whimper.</p> <p>I feel you grasp my hair as I move to kiss and caress your lips. I moan your name as you feel my lips move away from your lips. There is a pause as my lips leave your face as you look down and see the glistening moisture on my lips and my fingertips as they travel your arms. My hand trails down your chest and then back up. I hear your breath gasp as my hand slowly caresses the underside of your breasts. You run your fingers through my hair and then grab my waist once more and pull it up. Your hands pull my T-shirt over my head and throw it on the floor. Now with my hands holding on to your thighs, your knees buckle, and the only thing that holds you up is the soft material of the gym shorts as I pull them off your legs. I feel you arch your hips slightly, trying to get my hands inside your shorts, but my hands on your legs prevents it. I slowly run a hand up and onto your thigh as I kiss and lick my way down your body. I take a breast in my mouth and run my tongue across your flat stomach as I can feel your arousal and desire through your body.</p> <p>I move my lips back to your breast and tease your other breast with my tongue. I lick your belly button and hear you shudder as you arch your hips to give yourself to me. I move my way to your shorts and gently pull away. You are still breathing heavily but can't keep still. You push against my hands as I move slowly down your body. I move my mouth to your belly button as I lick and kiss it, tasting you as you moan from pleasure. I slowly run my tongue down your panties and across your thighs to touch the outside of your legs which part as I kiss and caress your flesh. Once again I move back up the bed and sit on the right side of you; I see the look of surprise on your face but you continue to look at the ceiling, hoping that you will not find your hands anywhere near me, and that I too will not be near you yet.</p> <p>You finally break the tension, looking as surprised and curious as you are. I kiss your face, nose and lips, as my fingers caress your thighs, just above your panties and your belly. Your tongue slips past my lips and the warmth and wetness of your mouth brings me closer to you and for the first time you taste yourself and want it so desperately. I move my left hand to the back of your head as my right hand holds your thigh close to your body and my fingers caress the skin covering the soft flesh. I continue, moving up and down slowly and ever so gently as you moan into my ear and then I kiss the top of your neck, the back of your ear. I hear you whimper slightly but otherwise you are not screaming in pleasure. I move my lips to the top of your shoulder as my hand comes up to the top of your head, pulling you closer.</p> <p>I can feel you tremble and shake as my tongue gently teases your skin; I love the feel of your soft skin as it passes between your lips to your skin and then you move your lips and tongue to meet mine. I gently pull you tighter to me as I gently push you in an upward direction while my other hand gently slips inside and caresses your abdomen and thigh. The motion causes you to gasp and writhe as my fingers brush your lips and then softly part them so that my fingers can move on down to the mound of your softness. I slowly move my tongue down and around your nipple and pull away to lick your lower belly while my fingers lightly caress your thighs and stomach. Your breathing increases and becomes faster and more ragged.</p> <p>I can feel you shaking as the electricity travels through your body and moves up to your stomach as you begin to moan a little louder and your hips begin to move more frantically, thrusting forward a little bit and then back as you can feel yourself start to tremble once more. My tongue trails down your other stomach then back up and across your lips. I keep looking into your eyes.</p> <p>"Please?" I ask as I push both my hands down and down on my thighs. "Please, please make love to me?"</p> <p>"Please?" The question surprises you. I push my tongue inside your lips and run it across your clitâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
