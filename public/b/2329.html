My little baby's in my arms. And I haven't even had a chance to finish our meal," she said, laughing.</p> <p>I sat back and took a sip of water before taking another sip, not bothering to take it down.</p> <p>"... and this is why I'm leaving. You don't want a divorce. Period. I've found someone better than a divorce. I can't leave you like that."</p> <p>I was starting to feel upset again in a way, and I took a sip of my water.</p> <p>"Oh. So where are we going to find a divorce? We can't just take our lives to Vegas because of my 'cousin.'?"</p> <p>"I think I can get us another marriage," she said. "We won't even have to talk about it anymore."</p> <p>"I'm going to be leaving too," I snapped. "After all, we have agreed to divorce."</p> <p>I took another sip of water, trying to relax.</p> <p>"I don't care if I divorce you," I snapped. "I'll just stay with you all I care about."</p> <p>Her eyes widened in shock.</p> <p>"I won't be leaving you," I said, trying to calm myself. "But only in my mind."</p> <p>"There has to be some explanation," she protested. "After all you've done for me over the years."</p> <p>I sighed, and shook my head. I didn't want to go into any more trouble with Alice. I wanted her to stay with me. But if that means living with me again, then so be it. I just didn't want her to feel like I was taking no for an answer.</p> <p>"I'll just take my chances with her," I said.</p> <p>She smiled sadly.</p> <p>"I can't!" she said.</p> <p>She looked around the large breakfast area and saw us. She was already dressed, and there was a note on one of the coffee tables telling me to keep my door unlocked, and that her cell phone would be on the house if I did. She then smiled a little more sadly as she turned towards the door.</p> <p>"We'll take care of that now," she said, and left the kitchen.</p> <p>It felt like Alice wouldn't move from her seat after only a few minutes of talking with me. I could still feel guilt about leaving her at the mercy of my anger, of all things being the reason I'd come here and stay at her apartment...</p> <p>She walked out the front door to my car and hopped into the passenger seat. She drove off immediately and I started the car, letting the engine warm up as we headed into town. I was starting to feel like Alice hadn't been the only person I had left in the world that day.</p> <p>She drove in silence for a long moment while we took in the countryside. I still thought she must have been leaving it all behind. I hoped so.</p> <p>"If you leave me, then we'll have to get back," I said one final time in the backseat. But just to shut I added:</p> <p>"I've got something special to make you feel special, and we can do whatever we want with it. But I won't be leaving you to die or get shot." I smiled at her. "You understand?"</p> <p>"Yes," she mumbled into the radio. "I understand. I've got everything I need to survive."</p> <p>When the car turned into her drive way, I took her hand.</p> <p>"I promise I'll keep you."</p> <p>...</p> <p>Chapter 13: Getting There</p> <p>As the miles passed we spoke, only speaking softly.</p> <p>"I miss you."</p> <p>"Yes," she mumbled, still trying to focus on her driving. "I love you."</p> <p>"I love you," I said.</p> <p>We drove in silence for another hour before I asked her to stop for a while and I changed the radio station into a country station, switching it off every few minutes. She followed me out of the car and we went back to the main street in town.</p> <p>"It's not fair that you're always alone," she complained, pointing to her face in the mirror.</p> <p>"You know that right? And it's my fault."</p> <p>"Then how could I blame you? You never even hinted that you wanted to stop," she protested. "What kind of person is I? Why would you want to just be left alone again?"</p> <p>"Because you're a young woman and the last thing I wanted to do was hurt you. You're just so damn beautiful!"</p> <p>She blushed furiously and looked awayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
