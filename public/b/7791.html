I slipped my finger from her pussy and started to lick them. She pulled at her lips, so I moved down and started to flick her clit with my tongue. She started to moan as I sucked on her clit and fingered her pussy. Her hips bucked up and down under my head. I kept on rubbing her pussy lips with my tongue. I wanted my dick in to her so bad. She tasted wonderful, warm and wet. I could feel her legs shaking under me. If I didn't stop right now I would have shot my load right here. Finally I could think of no other words and just slid my throbbing cock as deep and as hard as possible into her tight channel. Her pussy pulsated around me.</p> <p>She wrapped her legs around my hips and squeezed tight to me with all her strength. I started to go into her faster. I had never thrust more than once before. I looked down at her angelic face. Her mouth was wide and her eyes were shut. Her hips kept bucking at me and her legs were shaking.</p> <p>She had her hand down my pants now, trying to feel my cock. She grabbed onto my shaft as I kept up with her. Suddenly a wave of pleasure hit her body. My orgasm hit her at the same instant. I could feel it starting to subside. She sat there, her hand on my cock, her eyes closed with my cock deep in her pussy. I looked down at her. Her face was full of pleasure too, with a smile on her face. She looked so happy.</p> <p>I pulled my cock out and rolled her onto her back. She was looking down at me with a smile, the look of a dream. It was such a look. It would have made my head spin if it weren't for all the fluids I had in me. I got on my knees and slowly slid my cock into her. She leaned back and took my cock with her legs. I started to thrust in and out. She pushed up against me to try to get me in her deeper. As I felt her tight channel, I knew she wanted me in her more. She started to moan and buck against me. I kept doing it, I wouldn't, not again. She wanted me, I had to take her. I thrust in and out of her. With all my mind, I wanted to make her want me. The truth is, I wanted her more than anything in my life. I had to have her. That's all the reason for what happened. I couldn't say it because it felt like a dream, it was all the same from where I was. I couldn't think for anything at that moment. The only thing on my mind is that I never want to wake up in that condition in the morning. If a dream was better than today, I might come up from it. Nothing is better. When could we be togetherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
