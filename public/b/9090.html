He pulled her legs up and buried his face in her pussy and let out a moan as he licked his cum out of her pussy. He then got up and kneeled between her legs. He started to suck her pussy and as he did he felt a slight tingle. He could tell from her breathing that she wanted it in her pussy. When he began to lick her pussy he knew what effect this would have on her and he didn't tease.</p> <p>Soon she had a massive orgasm and she started pushing her pussy into his face trying to get him to eat her as she shook and quivered with orgasm. When she calmed down he moved up so he could get his dick in her. When he was ready he pushed the cock in as fast as he could as his entire length slid back into her. As he fucked her she pushed her hips back to meet his every thrust. Their position was like two animals mating. Their breathing had escalated and their movements sped up until suddenly he started to convulse with a big orgasm. He continued to pound into her as she ground back in his cock. She continued to grind her hips against his as their juices mingling together mixing with each other.</p> <p>They slowed to a stop for a few moments as they caught their breath. He put his lips on her pussy and they laid there for a short while. Both trying to catch their breaths as their bodies started to get stiff and aching again. Eventually they got up and his cock was a little swollen but not painful from last night. They went to the bathroom and she sat on the counter. He pulled his cock out of her pussy and it looked as though it was coated with a thick film of cum that ran down the whole length of it. They took their clothes off in a few minutes. She handed him a cold glass of water. He got her half wet but he got a full mouthful of cum and a half filled glass of water. She drank it down and said she tasted good.</p> <p>They walked around the house, made love twice more and had a small dinner downstairs. They spent the evening talking all the while holding hands. He felt more than one year older than she did and still could remember every intimate detail. She said that her husband had passed away a year ago when he was 25 years old so she decided to get pregnant. He didn't know what to say. He thought if she really wanted to have a child she would. He was still angry at her. She had told him that when she was 30 and told him she wanted to give it to him she would have the baby and that was it for his life. He thought that was crazy but he had always thought he had been the one. "You never had a chance," he finally said. "Besides, it's my life now."</p> <p>She looked at him and said, "It never mattered to me that you were just the guy I wanted to be with. I'm just having a hard time getting past you. So, I can't say no."</p> <p>Their words did nothing for me. In fact, I had feelings about it. He had asked me out before we got married and it was a big step for me to make that one decision. He didn't want to give me up; he just wanted to be able to take care of his girl. I was thinking 'Oh shit, I can't let her become pregnant'. I had never really thought about her that way. I didn't know what to do. All I knew was that I was having feelings for her that I hadn't felt for someone in years. So I told her to call me. I told her I loved her with all my heart and hoped to see her again. We finally got married and the four of us had a big day.</p> <p>Our relationship changed a lot during our marriage. We continued to have the same sex and when I found out that I had no problems with being bi I told her to go fuck herself into next month just to prove that the woman was indeed bi.</p> <p>I didn't see her for a month until we got married. I couldn't believe that I had fallen for someone else but my curiosity got the better of me. I went with her at the reception the first day as I had thought she might be someone I might just want to sleep with. The receptionist wanted to stay but I told her that I had a surprise for her and that I could get away with just having sex if she wanted to. After our first date she tried to persuade me that I should have sex with someone, but all the time she kept telling me that she wanted to just spend time with me. She wasn't quite as beautiful as she had been 5 years ago but her body looked great in those two pieces she was wearing. I couldn't wait until the following day to see her againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
