She said as she began stroking me up and down. We had not gotten to the point of my orgasm yet.</p> <p>"Let me do," she said as she started to suck me harder. I was trying to hold out but she continued. I couldn't, as with three things, I did not last long.</p> <p>I was spent and she could tell that. She was very proud of me even though I had been very selfish. Just then there was a knock at the door.</p> <p>"I'm going to open it now," she said but it took my breath away. She had a towel over my eyes and there was a look. It was a teary look, not of sadness or sadness, but of excitement.</p> <p>I don't like to be held, so she took my hands and helped me to my feet.</p> <p>"Let me do it, please!" I said and she bent and kissed me. This time she did not try to pull away. She kissed me deeply. Her tongue probed inside of my mouth. Her hand on my cheek moved to my chin and chin then to my neck. Her hand rubbed my chest and I was thinking I had never made a man cry before. This was something I had never done with a woman. She moved over to the bed next to me and I felt her hand on my thigh.</p> <p>"Let me do something, please."</p> <p>Her hand was slowly moving down onto my naked cock. I could feel how soft and soft she was.</p> <p>"Let me," I moaned.</p> <p>Her body was on top of me and I could feel, smell, taste her body. She kissed me deeply then, so deeply, kissed me, licked and licked. My hands were on her back, sliding up and down. I could see no skin but her breasts. I could feel her stomach and stomach. She pulled back.</p> <p>"I want your cock inside my pussy," she whispered.</p> <p>I kissed her breasts. She did the same and moved to my cock and I could feel her labia rubbing the head. I wanted to fuck her.</p> <p>"Oh, Yes! Now. Now!" I said and she said it again and again.</p> <p>She turned and we made it into a 69. She was on top, holding my cock, pulling on my balls. It was more of a reverse cowgirl.</p> <p>We made love in a way I never before thought possible. It was amazing.</p> <p>She sucked me until I was about ready to cum.</p> <p>"Let's get under the covers."</p> <p>She reached over and pulled the sheet off. She came down on my cock. My legs were on hers and I could feel her hand again working the head of my cock. I was as close to cumming and as she was, the sensation was great.</p> <p>When she got me to the brink, she was back down sucking me again. But when I couldn't hold on I got to the point.</p> <p>"I am going to cum!" I blurted out. She sensed my situation and lifted up, looking me in the eyes. She was not looking around to see if anyone was there. She was staring at me.</p> <p>"Cum!" she whispered and sucked me down into the dark. My legs almost buckled under her and she held my cock to keep me from going.</p> <p>I was at the edge now. I could not stop and I shot into her mouth.</p> <p>She let me go.</p> <p>"Now I want more!"</p> <p>She moved between my legs, my ass up. I heard her take my cock in her hand and she brought it to my ass. She slid down till she was on her knees. I could feel her hands on my ass. I could feel them slide up my legs.</p> <p>"Yes, do it!" I moaned. "Do me!"</p> <p>She held my ass with her hands and slowly pushed her self down. My legs fell down, one on her back and one on my head. Her breasts fell on my body. I was sure she could hear the gasp that escaped me. Her mouth stayed on my cock.</p> <p>"Oh, yes. Right there."</p> <p>I could feel her tongue lapping on my skin. I have had only two men, one since I was a teenager. Each made me cum, but the first one was not as good for me. The second one just made me more nervous. She moved back up my body, but my cock was between her cheeks now. Now I could feel her ass rubbing my cock and the tip was on my chin. Her hands left my cock and slid down my sides.</p> <p>"I can't go yet," she whispered and sucked me back into her mouth. Her hands moved up and down my shoulders and chest. She took both nipples between thumb and foreâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
