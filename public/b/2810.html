My lips are sealed. I'm only just getting started.</p> <p>"You'll love it. Take it all in.</p> <p>"This is so much better than all of it before. Thank you."</p> <p>With that, she turned on the shower and we both stepped in. Once I was all bathed, she began lathering me up. It didn't take me long to finish washing her beautiful body.</p> <p>She gave me a good kiss and then began the same treatment of me as after the shower. By the time she had finished me, we both were pretty well coated.</p> <p>"That's enough for now," she said.</p> <p>"Can I do it my turn."</p> <p>"Just one more thing," she said in that kind of commanding voice. "I want you to kiss both of my breasts. Lick the nipples. They're still a nice firm size. I want you to suck them and make them as wet as possible before you enter my pussy."</p> <p>I did as she told me, and she took a nipple in her mouth, making me shudder. Then, once my fingers had coated her left nipple, she ran the flat of one up over her right, leaving a trail of her sticky juices over the nipple.</p> <p>"You know, once you start kissing my breast, you're going to have to go down on me," she said. "There are so many of them available at the moment."</p> <p>I didn't have to think too hard about that. If I did, I'd have already gone down on her. Her nipples were already coated in thick, white lather.</p> <p>"Yes, I might like to do that," I said.</p> <p>"Why don't you sit on the edge of the tub until I get done, and I'll get that lovely thing out for you," she said. Then she got out of the shower. I sat down and kissed her breasts some more.</p> <p>"Now that that was great, maybe we won't have to do it another time," she said. Then she turned around and bent so the side of the shower was facing us. I stepped in and washed her hair, taking particular delight in the way her hair swayed.</p> <p>I started on her shoulders, and her gorgeous arms. She was already beginning to get wet, and getting ready to play for me. I lather her front first, and then worked down her arms. She took in quick shallow breaths. When I got to her breasts, I ran my hands over them from base to crest, and then began to give them an extra-long slow stroke up and down, spreading them, giving greater stimulation as I went.</p> <p>When I got to her stomach, my hands moved almost naturally to both their lower limits. My hands continued to explore the swell of her abdomen, but I lingered at the top of her mound. I ran my finger down her slit, then slowly up again, making the tip of my finger slide up her lips several times.</p> <p>"That...feels so good. Just a bit of pressure at first, but soon it's so much better. Oh yes...I like that," she sighed.</p> <p>Then, she took my head in her hands. "That's so nice. Put your tongue in me and lick me everywhere. Oh...yes...yeah..."</p> <p>With that in mind, I went directly for her clit. She took in a quick breath, then released one in response to the sensation of my tongue.</p> <p>"Yes...that's the spot. Just like that," she urged me. "Oh...yes...yes. Oh...yes..."</p> <p>I continued tonguing her clit in slow, deliberate motions while she spread her legs wider and let her body go to bed. Then the feeling turned in her hips and her legs clamped together and then she began to quake.</p> <p>"Oh...oh...ohhh...Oh," she cried. "Suck me, make me come..."</p> <p>As she neared orgasm, she took off her blindfold and stared into my eyes for the first time. I don't think I'd ever seen eyes that bright, so blue that she could even make out the iridescence.</p> <p>"Oh...oh...oh..." she cried. Her hips had risen up to meet me as my lips and tongue continued to work on her clit.</p> <p>"A...aa...aa...aa..." she moaned as she bucked herself against my face. "Ah...that's so nice...I...that's soooo nice...I...I...mmmm."</p> <p>Even though her voice was half in gasps, I began to hear a squelching sound.
