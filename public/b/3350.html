I'm not a virgin anymore. No way are I going to lose my cherry to my new husband."</p> <p>"That's fine," she said with a little more conviction. Then she added, "I like that. And, you won't get your cherry after your first time."</p> <p>"You are on," he returned.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't want to lose it," she said with an almost innocent shrug of her shoulders. She had the grace to blush.</p> <p>Derek laughed at the way she spoke to him. That smile on her face must have been enough to make him smile. "Have you got time to get over here?" he asked.</p> <p>"Uh, there's more than one time to go."</p> <p>"Oh, I think you're still on," he teased and raised an eyebrow. He thought it was a tease that got the joke in her eyes, but the look left nothing to the imagination.</p> <p>"Well, I guess I'll have to find a way to stop right now. When do we start going out?"</p> <p>"We'll start right away, in a couple of weeks. Are we done for the day and going shopping in the next hour?"</p> <p>"You bet. I've missed all that."</p> <p>"But not today," he insisted, holding out a hand. She shook his hand as best she could in both hands.</p> <p>Derek had been on the phone almost as soon as they walked in the door. He wanted to see the girls, and make sure they were okay. He wanted them to know that he had never been with a girl before, but to hear from his mom that she was okay. It was almost as if his mind had been made up out of a mixture of conflicting emotions. The first half of an hour had gone by very quickly, with no conversation. He had come back to her every little second, without her telling him what a good little boy he was. He felt a little guilty as he thought of his mom being a "good little boy" as his dad had called him. The girls were still around, but had given up their game. He didn't realize how much longer they stayed in their playful and friendly demeanor.</p> <p>When he got tired of this routine, he asked for the girls to come back into the living room and put on some music. He would turn out the stereo on this afternoon. Then he would go sit down out on the couch, just watching.</p> <p>When the girls came back into the living room, they stood there for a few seconds. One of them asked, "When did you two stop going out?"</p> <p>Derek looked at her with his eyebrows up. "I've been going out for the last fifteen minutes. Do you want us to come back here again?" He asked with a grin.</p> <p>"Oh, hell yes!" The two girls walked over to stand on either side of him with their hands on his face. They pushed him towards the couch, their faces close to his. Derek took a deep breath and followed their lead. His hands were shaking a little but they were a lot softer than their mom. He didn't know how much time was left for him to play with the girls. They had to have figured out that by now and it wasn't a good thing.</p> <p>As he watched, his hands went automatically to the cheeks of their asses. When he reached one cheek, they pressed into his face with a soft pressure. He opened his mouth and found them and sucked on their tongues as they slowly melted into his mouth, pushing their sweet young tits into his chest. God, it was wonderful. It was the best feeling he had ever had.</p> <p>His hand went up between their legs and felt their naked wet pussies pressed against his fingers. The two started rubbing themselves against him, feeling the wet heat of his hands as they squeezed on them. He turned them around and had them facing the back of the couch. He held their tits with his hands and sucked each nipple. The taste was incredible. Then they turned around and pressed against his throbbing cock.</p> <p>With all the sensations, they were ready. He put the girls down onto the floor between his legs as he slid his cock up and down their pussies. His hands went to the girls' asses and began rubbing their ass cheeks as he slowly fucked the blonde girls. He was glad that his mother had kept an old picture. It gave him something to jerk off to in the middle of an open bedroom. He kept a firm grip while he stroked himself.</p> <p>His ballsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
