There are lots of places you can cum without needing an orgasm, such as the head of his cock; there are those little places where it is easier to slide in, while it is still pleasurable.</p> <p>"Now that's nice," I told him. "Now I want you to fuck me hard until you can't feel anything else."</p> <p>With a grunt, he dropped to all fours to enter me. As he did once, I guided both of us into a new direction. I knew he would love it to be on top.</p> <p>It was the position where the two of us could lay on our sides and fuck in a rhythm that had both of us getting off. It was a position that a lot of sexual experimentation went into once they got it right.</p> <p>As we settled into that position, a thought occurred to me. "I think that you've always wanted me to lie on my back like this."</p> <p>"Yes, that's what I wanted, in fact, a lot more than that..." He said, as he lay on his back.</p> <p>"I'll do that," I told him, "I'll use my hands all over you, caressing you and pinching your nipples. You'll like that very much, because I know you will."</p> <p>"That's not fair, I thought you liked that, just that I was a little hard. I think that would be your turn again."</p> <p>"I did, once in a while when you were with another guy; but we got caught in the throes of passion, and I think it would have been my turn."</p> <p>That thought brought an indescribable thrill to my heart. "Are you all right in there?"</p> <p>"I'm fine; you can sit up, but I could help you.</p> <p>"Okay, but first, you need to ask for one of these nice, comfortable positions."</p> <p>He got up from the bed, and with my help, got up on his knees with his hips facing me down the end of the bed. I looked and sure enough, there was an easy position with his penis pointing straight at me. When he got off the bed, I said, "Hold this, honey."</p> <p>He set it to the end of the bed, next to his chair. I reached out and touched the back of his neck, the backs of his hands, and the inside of his chest. With my hands, I ran my fingers down the front of his thighs.</p> <p>"That's very nice," I told him. "Now, I want you to play with that marvelous penis of yours."</p> <p>He did, and I began to lick the top of his sack. I worked my way back to the base. "You know what to do," I told him as I worked on the bottom. "Just hold it. And squeeze it gently with your palms.</p> <p>I ran my fingers all over the sensitive part under the cock and shaft, taking special care to make it feel good as well.</p> <p>I moved over to the other side to my favorite position. "It's easier to do this," I told him.</p> <p>"It's not too uncomfortable, is it?"</p> <p>"No, not at all, but you'll have to use your finger, if you want to find out how it feels."</p> <p>He got on the bed beside him. "I want you to do that again; but this time stick it in me again."</p> <p>I had a small opening for him to take in, but couldn't imagine myself doing it again, even with a dildo. That would have been too awkward.</p> <p>"Okay, that's good; now, come here and sit on my lap."</p> <p>"You're still hard," he said. "Don't you want to help me with it?"</p> <p>"Absolutely," I told him. "Just put it where it's comfortable."</p> <p>"Okay, so we've got the same angle," he told me. "Do you really want me to do it again?"</p> <p>"Do it again, just do it slowly."</p> <p>"It's so soft! It feels so good."</p> <p>"That's good, because you're going to love this."</p> <p>We both went back to the chair. I had my legs pulled up and spread, and his hand was on the outside of my thigh. I could feel his fingers lightly playing with my pubic hair.</p> <p>"What's it feel like?" he asked.</p> <p>"Just do it, while I'll watch."</p> <p>I didn't know any women did this for me, but my ex-boyfriend, with whom Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
