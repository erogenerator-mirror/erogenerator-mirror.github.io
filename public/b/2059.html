You know; 'It's just like on our video game and you're going to get hurt,' and what kind of crazy event is this?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I do," she said, "I thought we should do it at home sometime."</p> <p>"So, I brought the champagne, and we should just get home and get on with this," I said, opening the door and walking in.</p> <p>"So we're going to have a party tonight," she said, and then added, "We can't remember what's going on in our car now, can we?"</p> <p>"Um, okay, I guess, since we're in the car and I'm driving," I said.</p> <p>"Haha, okay," she returned with a bemused smile, "I still have a ways to go. Well, don't tell anyone we left the party, okay?"</p> <p>I pulled in the drive way, and then we grabbed the champagne, and walked out into my apartment complex, taking the keys that my mother left for me while it was still in the car.</p> <p>"Mmm, he doesn't seem much to mess up now," she said, as I opened the door for her.</p> <p>Inside the living room, there was my Mom, sitting on the couch, playing some music, still talking on the intercom.</p> <p>"We have a date," said Mom, "Can I come sit with you for a minute?"</p> <p>"Sure," I answered back, "And just who should I sit next to?"</p> <p>"What's with that, anyway? How long have you known each other, anyway?" she asked back.</p> <p>"I'm really not sure," I said, "I met you through the mail," I explained, "I'm sorry to say that we're only half way through the story now, but if you've got your head in your hands, I'm sure we can come to a resolution."</p> <p>"And by that, I really mean it," she responded, looking down and away from me, "Let's just enjoy the evening together."</p> <p>"Okay," I responded, "We'll see you in a couple of days at the party at the beach."</p> <p>"Mhmmm," she said, nodding, "Well, I think that's a great idea."</p> <p>I didn't tell Mom where my place was, and I certainly didn't tell her that it was the beach we both were invited to. My mom just got on her knees and went to the bathroom.</p> <p>"We'll see if we can find your car," she said, standing up as I gathered the champagne and went to open her jacket. She had on a pair of jeans and a white tank top that showed the top of a nice set of boobs.</p> <p>Inside my condo, we took a small break and I went out with her to get a drink while she sat on the couch with the TV remote. The only thing that the TV was on was the weather station. She sat there, and we drank and talked about all sorts of crazy details, including some of the new stuff she had seen in those magazines she'd seen me buy.</p> <p>Mom had already been in her bikini bottoms, so I knew that she probably wasn't wearing any underwear when she sat beside me in the kitchen, and when I opened the refrigerator to get us both refills of champagne, it dawned on me that she hadn't even removed her top. That meant that her boobs were practically hanging out of the blue tank top.</p> <p>"What about the clothes?" Mom asked.</p> <p>"Um, what'd you think?" I asked, turning towards her, her eyes locked on mine.</p> <p>"You haven't done too much for me," she responded, "I like being able to have what I want."</p> <p>"Okay," I responded, "but I'm glad that it's so much easier now to keep quiet. If we're going to go through that sort of thing, I'm sure that will never leave your house."</p> <p>The truth was that, because of my Dad's divorce, my Mom was really not much into nudity. She thought that because I had a family, a job, she would have to go around making nude trips. I had never really felt like that, though, and I wasn't even sure that I liked it. She knew though that, if I would just go with her, it wouldn't bother me.</p> <p>So after a little longer than necessary, I went and got us two glasses of champagne.
