I sat down at the foot of the bed.</p> <p>"How was the day?"</p> <p>As he approached me, I turned my head to say, "It's your birthday and the day has arrived."</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>"It's a beautiful day, doesn't it?" I heard as he pulled the sheets down from my bed and pushed them down.</p> <p>"I didn't just come over for a change of clothes, and that's exactly what I am going to do," he told me, his words not quite in my head but in my mind.</p> <p>I was so wrapped up in my dream of seeing my man naked that I was about to yell out and start a fight so I wouldn't get hurt! I didn't really need to know and he would probably just keep going.</p> <p>"It's just that for me, I really prefer to be naked around you" I tried to think back as he held my hand in his.</p> <p>"I know it's been a while," he told me, his eyes moving across my body as he said it. When I said it I said it again, "it's been a long time since I have felt something like this."</p> <p>I didn't know what the heck to even say to him, so, after a few moments, I tried to think what I should say to this man. Instead, I just said, "I can't tell you how much I love you so much and how much I love being with you," in one quick motion.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>"I'm glad you chose me?" asked Mike as he opened the door to my room to my surprise.</p> <p>He was right. I had chosen him for me. I really liked him. I just never expected to see him naked. He wasn't big, maybe six two with a little bit of weight on his chest, but he did look good enough to eat.</p> <p>"Don't you remember me taking a shower just before the party and then you being naked all the time? My birthday did happen, didn't it?"</p> <p>"Yes, but that's where I want you. You have no idea how much I've missed being naked, I've missed being here with you. I was hoping you wouldn't want to be here," he told me.</p> <p>After a moment of silence, I heard him whisper in my ear, "I can't wait to see that gorgeous body of yours," as he walked toward me to get into my shower.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>To be continued . . â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
