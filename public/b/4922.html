I was just trying to be a friend."</p> <p>"I'm not mad. We have to get back there. I won't even tell your parents."</p> <p>When she spoke again it was more of this statement than the words. She wasn't going to tell them.</p> <p>"So tell me what you think," she said, giving me a quick kiss on the cheek.</p> <p>"I don't mean to be so forward, but I love you so much I just want to stay friends."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"Because it's not like we're going to get married." I said, grinning.</p> <p>"True. I don't want your kind of commitment."</p> <p>"If you don't want me to marry you I don't want you to take me home because I've got a car."</p> <p>I thought she'd have the best of it and let me go. Instead, she grabbed my hand and brought it to her face. She took a breath and exhaled. "I just want us to get back together... I've been such a fool this past year." She said as she slowly ran her hand over my cheek. "It's not just love, it's commitment. You just have to tell me, ok?"</p> <p>I nodded my head, giving hers a hug and a kiss as I took her in my arms. I could feel the heat of her body against me and her head rested against my chest. She didn't push away, she just leaned to me, wrapping her body around mine and taking slow deep breaths. I started to move so she couldn't move, but she made the decision and wrapped her arms around my neck, kissing me with passion. I moved my hands over her back and down to her thighs as she kept her lips pressed to mine. I slowly brought my hands up her body, caressing her soft skin. I reached her shirt and pulled it off. She smiled and took my face in her hands and planted a long kiss on my lips. I had my hands on her waist and she started to get up. I gently wrapped her in my arms and kissed her stomach and hips and then her lips. She smiled at me.</p> <p>"Do you want to tell me where we are going?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"OK. The next stop is to the gym. You'll find a change here." I said with a smile.</p> <p>"Sounds good." She said and we kissed and I slowly led her to the locker room where the shower was. We got into the shower and the water cascaded over us. I started to kiss her neck and shoulders as I moved down to her breasts. My hands ran over her body as I kissed them, moving all the way around. I took a nipple into my mouth and gently nibbled on it. She tilted her head and looked into my eyes as I took her nipple back into my mouth. Slowly I worked her breasts while my hand continued to slowly play with her pussy. She pushed her hips against my hand while her fingers played in my long hair.</p> <p>"Oooh, that feels so good," she cooed.</p> <p>I switched to her other breast and began to work her with my mouth, licking, kissing and sucking. A small orgasm shook through her body as I continued to tease her with my mouth. I slipped my lips off one of her breasts as she moaned. I then moved down her body. I pushed her legs up so they were out in the air while I kissed my way down to her pussy. Her scent was intoxicating and the feeling of pleasure that washed over me was indescribably intense. I stuck my tongue out toward her waiting hole and slowly licked her. I could immediately feel the tension in her body. I looked up at her as I licked her.</p> <p>"Oh... oh..." she softly groaned out as I kissed her inner thigh. Soon she was thrashing about and humping my mouth. She pushed my head down onto her and held my head tightly. Her legs got wide as she humped harder into me and I knew she was going to cum. I continued to lick her and she bucked her hips into my face until she came, leaving a trail of her nectar on my chest and abdomen. My mouth moved to her other outer thigh as I licked all around and up and down her inner thighs. She moaned with pleasure as I reached her clit with my tongue. I rubbed it as I continued to lick her. My own release was quickly approaching as I held her hips tight while she humped my face. I didn't want to cum yet, so I slowed down on her clit. I looked up at her and she was grinning, a look of contentment on her face.</p> <p>"I'm on the pill," I said with a devious grinâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
