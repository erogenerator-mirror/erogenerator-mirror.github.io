That's the whole plan, that's exactly what John and the doctor say when you need to get it. I looked up at the stars and smiled as John came closer to me and put his arm on my shoulder. I smiled as he placed his hand on my belly and slowly ran his finger along my belly button. "There you are," he whispered as he looked over all my bones.</p> <p>"Thank God," I whispered back and he squeezed me even tighter. "I was afraid you wanted to be with me again."</p> <p>"Why does it have to be this way?" he asked and I could see by the way his eyes were looking at me, I wouldn't want to be with him either. "Are you sure you wanted to go through with this?"</p> <p>"I'm sure," I said and I looked around to make sure they weren't still out in the woods. "This is different. This part of life isn't this place."</p> <p>"No?" he asked and shook his head. "If you don't believe me when I'm not around and maybe it's not right that we're here, then I think you're crazy. Trust me." He leaned forward and kissed my neck and I let him kiss me for a moment. "I understand. I want you to be happy."</p> <p>I smiled and looked over at the stars. "I know," I said. "You're wonderful."</p> <p>His hand was still on my belly and he just gently kept going until he had my jeans open and his fingers were caressing my bare skin. I closed my eyes and let his fingers trace around the outer lips of my pussy. My back arched a little as he continued to kiss and suck on my neck and chest. I opened my eyes and looked into his and we smiled. "I love you," I said and kissed him hard. "That was so sweetly."</p> <p>"It is," he said with an affectionate grin which seemed to fill my eyes. He kissed me again and this time his tongue slipped between my lips as our mouths touched and he felt the softness of my teeth.</p> <p>His kiss was soft and sweet and when our lips finally separated I looked down and saw him looking at me. A little tear had fallen silently across my cheek and I wiped it away without wanting to. "It's my turn now," I said as I moved to kneel on the ground and pulled on his jeans.</p> <p>His blue eyes opened a little wider. I kissed his chest as he removed his shirt and his eyes looked down at me with an embarrassed smile. "Will you help me?"</p> <p>"Of course," I said as I lifted my hands and started sliding the jeans off of his legs. "It's up to you. But I'm sure you'd like it. Are you game?"</p> <p>"Yes," he said as he pulled the jeans off of his feet. "But it's your turn first."</p> <p>"Yes sir," I said as I pulled off my clothes and got kneeling before him. "Do it."</p> <p>He laughed a little. "I think you better hurry," he said as he pushed my head down towards his erection. "We don't want to be left out."</p> <p>"I want to suck on you," I said as I held him in my mouth. I ran my tongue around the tip and he moaned when I licked the head with my tongue. He pushed himself into my mouth and I felt more excitement than I had ever felt from a man, but it didn't last. I looked up at him and saw him smiling down at me as I held him gently in my mouth.</p> <p>He was a little shorter than me but about as big around as my forearm and still growing in my mouth. He still had that wonderful feeling a man gets when he doesn't know that it's in him. My heart beat a little faster when I finally looked into his eyes and saw the passion in them. He was about to push himself deep into my throat and he knew it and my heart beat so hard in my chest it almost hurt.</p> <p>I stopped him from moving his dick and looked up at him with a smile. "I love you," I said and I saw his eyes widen to see me before he looked away. I knew I was going to make him feel good and I wanted to feel better than I had done.</p> <p>"I love you too," he said back and he held onto me tightly as I worked my mouth around his cock. I pulled down on my lower lip, feeling the blood in my mouth as I pulled him down, opening my mouth up and letting the head of his cock slide into my mouth. I slowly moved down and let half of it go between my lips. I wanted to enjoy his pleasure so I stayed very still as I swallowed and sucked on the head of hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
