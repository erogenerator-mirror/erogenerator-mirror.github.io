But I still couldn't resist. "I just need to know, for the next time, is this true?"</p> <p>Gwen smiled. "I don't want you to think that I made you believe that I would marry you unless I've actually committed incest. I know it can be tricky." she added hopefully.</p> <p>I shook my head, feeling guilty. I felt guilty when my daughter and I were alone. But I couldn't stop thinking about what she'd done. "Gwen..." I started, trying to say a safe word. "I love you. I want to marry you. I want you to make this our time."</p> <p>Gwen was quiet for a moment, and I could tell she was thinking and planning my proposal, which she had obviously worked out. After a long pause, she said, "You really have to go. I love you more than anything."</p> <p>I smiled at her and said, "I'm sorry." Then I headed for the door. I turned back to her, feeling a mixture of hurt and happiness. I kissed her briefly on the lips as I walked out of the apartment.</p> <p>My car was parked in the driveway. I sat and drove to a coffee shop to fix a sandwich for myself and get a bite to eat. After paying, I left Gwen's place. On the way home, I stopped in at the grocery store to pick up a few things. When I got home, I took a nap. I decided to go over to the bookstore to read an issue of NakedGirl. It was close, but I was too young to realize that I needed to take my chances on getting a job. I found an old-fashioned book, but could never figure out why someone would want to read with a woman reading porn. The book was as boring as it was good—it had such a bad flavor that it was as disgusting to me as the words. I started to look for something else to read. I could feel the pressure building. At the same time, the fact that I was naked and being watched by my daughter didn't help with the pressure I was feeling. I finally gave in to the temptation and went home. I was nervous to walk in on my daughter in just a tank top.</p> <p>When I got there, I went to the back of the bookstore. There were two empty booths to go in, and a window to be opened, which made me feel like such a pervert. When I walked in the back, I closed the curtain and went into the middle of the booth. I could hear Gwen in the doorway.</p> <p>Gwen started. "Daddy..." She started to say. But then stopped and looked at me, unsure.</p> <p>I knew she needed time to think, but I didn't want to disappoint. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have barged in..." She said.</p> <p>That broke the tension. "It's okay." I reassured her gently.</p> <p>Gwen stood on the other side of the counter, and looked me over. "My heart's beating so hard. What you saw was beautiful."</p> <p>Then I turned to Gwen and said, "I'm glad you like it. I don't mean to be a pervert. But I just have these naughty thoughts."</p> <p>Gwen sat on the other side of the counter, and looked up at me. "Can I ask you something?" she asked, with a little uncertainty.</p> <p>I nodded. "Sure. Whatever you want."</p> <p>Gwen looked at me for a few moments. "Can I ask you something?" she asked.</p> <p>It was a serious question. I thought that she really had to know, and I wanted her to ask me the question. "Of course. What is it?" I suggested.</p> <p>Gwen hesitated. "Did you really like what I did with my mouth?" Gwen asked.</p> <p>I laughed. "Did you think I'd ever let a man cum into your mouth?"</p> <p>Gwen looked away and shrugged. "No. I guess I never expected for anyone not to do it once." Gwen said.</p> <p>I laughed. "I'm flattered. I really wasn't expecting things to happen."</p> <p>Gwen stood up. "I shouldn't have done that." she said.</p> <p>"I didn't mean anything by it. Don't bother to say it." I said, trying not to raise my voice. "It's not something I did. That's not how I feel I guess."</p> <p>"How have you been?" Gwen asked.</p> <p>I leaned towards her and said, "This is all I could think of. It's the best I could do."</p> <p>"It's the only thing I have to do, Daddy. I just had so much time on my hands." Gwen said.</p> <p>After a—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
