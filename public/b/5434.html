I said.</p> <p>She nodded her head and said, "Honey, he's not gonna hurt us. I think everyone is in a better mood."</p> <p>"Well I think you'll be ok after your spankings." I assured her. We both agreed. As we waited for the next client I noticed that we could hear the heavy breathing of the group. As the door opened and my assistant walked in, she looked a bit nervous, so I put my arm around her back and pulled her back into a kiss. At first it was a little awkward but I had hoped she would be more comfortable as I had always liked being in charge, to have control of women and not to be under my own control, so I decided to test the waters a little.</p> <p>The look that came out of her mouth made my erection stir. "I'm so nervous," she said.</p> <p>"Honey, you're in control." I said.</p> <p>"Yes, I am." she said, smiling, but obviously a little nervous.</p> <p>We kept kissing and rubbing and I moved her so that she was propped on top of my lap, my legs around her waist. I was hoping the angle of our position would allow her to grind on my cock, but in the confines of the office and the office lights, and being in no hurry to get her off, it was not likely. The position caused me to feel exposed and vulnerable as I was positioned on the edge of the desk. I was not about to risk this feeling any further.</p> <p>I took the opportunity of placing her hand onto the head of my cock. She grasped on to the girth, pulling it in the direction of her pussy. I was surprised to begin with and was not entirely surprised when she slid her finger up the underside, getting the full length of just the head. She kept this motion slow and steady, taking all she could as she explored. The sensations I felt were a little bit different than she was used to. She seemed to know how to stroke me, but then began to speed up and rotate her body slightly. I was afraid she was going to try to get me inside of her but in just a minute or two, I realized she was not trying to get me in, she was rubbing her clit just enough to get a little extra, and to stimulate her nipples.</p> <p>She pulled her finger from her pussy and brought it towards my mouth, then slowly slid it over my lips. I opened my mouth and welcomed her inside of it, sucking on the head. I felt her body tense at this point, not wanting to waste the moment. She was now almost screaming as she pulled her finger out of my mouth. I had a small orgasm as she did this. My head jerked back as she pressed her finger back into my mouth and I heard her moan. She pulled her fingers out of my mouth and grabbed the desk with both hands, pulling it back as I had done to me so many times as she fucked my face. Her moaning was louder than I had ever heard her cry before as her eyes rolled back in to pleasure.</p> <p>She let go of the desk as I released her ear from the vice and just held it out for her to play with, which she did. She kept playing with and then began to work her finger in and out of my mouth as she was moaning. I sucked on it. It tasted great. A few seconds later, she began to groan louder. Soon, I was breathing heavily as well as feeling the build up of excitement in my balls. She brought both her hands up to her breasts and began to pinch her nipples gently while still rubbing her clit and I saw her eyes roll back into her head. Her groan grew more and louder as she came onto my mouth.</p> <p>This elicited an appreciative look from her as she pulled more of me into her face. It sent a wave of pleasure through my body. I could tell she was enjoying sucking on my hard cock. I looked up to see a look of total satisfaction on her face through her eyes.</p> <p>"Mmmm," she moaned in satisfaction as she sucked my cock even harder.</p> <p>I felt she was getting close again and decided to have some fun, so I put both of my hands around her shoulders and slid her down my cock. I put my hands on her hips to keep her sitting next to my shaft. I wanted to slide up to take her in my mouth as fast and hard as you want to. This turned into my favorite position. I slid up the length of my shaft, just a couple of inches back, then slowly slid down, again stopping near the head.</p> <p>She seemed to like this position, so I just sat back and admired her beautiful body. I could just feel the tension on my cock and felt in control of her.</p> <p>"Do youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
