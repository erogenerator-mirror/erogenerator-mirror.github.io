As his wife licked her lips, she reached her hand down to his pulsating penis, she wrapped her fingers around his hardness and felt the heat. She pulled back and asked him. "Can I feel what you're up to," she asked her husband in a sexy voice.</p> <p>"You've got to be kidding, but how are you going to feel it, Baby?" Bill asked his wife as she looked at him. "You've got your fingers around it haven't you?" he asked.</p> <p>"I'll take care of that, if that's alright with you, Darling," she said as she slowly started to work her husband's cock. His eyes closed as he enjoyed her touch, feeling her warm wet mouth, caressing his hard shaft, and her sexy mouth.</p> <p>She took her other hand and massaged his balls, and then lifted herself slightly toward her husband as she moved closer to him. Her lips met briefly as they kissed, then she took his cock in her hand, stroking it firmly as her hand moved over it, feeling the heat and hardness in her hand. They kissed again briefly, then her lips returned to his. They kissed passionately, feeling the passion that was building between them, with his cock pressing hard against her ass.</p> <p>Her hand moved up and down his stiff shaft while she kept kissing him. She broke the kiss as if to say she wanted more, and Bill watched his wife's face as she looked down into his face, with him watching her with a satisfied smile. They broke the kiss and she looked at him with a sexy smile, then kissed back before lowering her mouth and kissing him again. Their tongues danced together as their mouths probed each other's mouth.</p> <p>"Put your hand on my balls, Baby," Bill directed to her as he reached behind to feel her. She raised her arms above her head as she raised herself into the air. It seemed as if they were going to be on the other side of the bed. He guided her to the edge of the bed, and he sat next to her and put his arms around her while she slid down to lay on her back on the bed. He gently lifted one of her legs and lifted her other leg over his shoulder, while he reached down to feel the swell in her ass. Her legs were spread and her thighs were drawn over his. He lifted her ass higher, feeling the firmness of her cheeks as his hands kneaded the flesh, and his fingers traced the crease between her ass and thighs.</p> <p>Her face was inches below his as she held his cock, making little purring purring noises, while she continued to hold his stiff cock. As he held her legs up, her ass moved against him, pressing her wetness against his cock. She opened her eyes just a little, looked at him as he touched her inner thighs, and then closed them as he lowered the head of his cock to the hole of her pussy.</p> <p>He could feel her lips sliding against his shaft as he slowly pushed it forward, feeling the opening of her love canal. She moaned as it went in, and closed her eyes as she felt him slowly enter her warm wet womanhood. He paused for a moment, and then pushed his cock deeper into her. He could see in her eyes that he was filling her love canal, and he felt her muscles holding him in tightly.</p> <p>"I'll be careful, Baby," he whispered as he moved his hips slowly, pulling his cock back and then going deeper. He continued to feel and stroke her pussy, letting her feel his cock move in and out as he moved in and out.</p> <p>"Your fucking beautiful," he whispered to her. "You feel so damn good," he told her as he lowered his upper body over hers. When he lowered his face, his kiss was on her mouth. His tongue slipped between her lips, and he tasted himself on her tongue for a moment before he let it slide across hers. She licked his lips before kissing him again, as she looked into his eyes.</p> <p>It was time for her husband. She slowly raised her face from where they were, feeling his cock slide from her pussy as it pulled from her body. He slowly drew back, and then back in again, feeling the wet heat as he slid it in. He felt his balls slapping against her ass as he bottomed out against her. A low growling hum of pleasure filled the room as his hands caressed her body.</p> <p>"I don't know what you like me to do, Baby," Bill told her as her face came up to meet his. "Don't you know? You're not supposed to talk?"</p> <p>"I know you like it like that, and I want to hear you," she said as she smiled up at him. She loved hearing his wordsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
