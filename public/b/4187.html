I couldn't think what else to say - and that made me feel even worse. I got up to use the bathroom, but stopped to listen to the sounds coming from next door. It sounded like someone was doing it so I went back in the room and stood by the bed. I sat down on the bed and waited. There wasn't much. I didn't want to hear it, so I kept my eyes closed while listening to the noises coming from next door. The sound was coming from the foot of the bed. It must have been a man. When the man got on the bed and looked around I realized he was naked underneath! He looked good in that position, and I felt a little guilt rush through my body.</p> <p>I knew that was what I had agreed to, and I had agreed to be fucked. He was a big man, and he must have been in his mid-forties, with long dark hair, and it looked as if he was shaved down around his eyes. His body looked good. What was going on? I felt ashamed all over again, but was it wrong to be thinking about sex with someone's father?</p> <p>I listened and could be heard walking out of the room. A man had got on top of the bed. I was sure it had to have been the man who had stripped before getting on the bed and getting on top of him. It must have gotten to the bed while I waited and he reached out and started stroking himself. I saw him put both hands on his head, feeling his hair, and then he lowered his head onto the bed. He was sucking on his cock. I could see a bead of the clear fluid that had been on the tip of his dick with his lips. I started wondering whether it had been the man who was sucking his dick, or the man who was fucking the other man. I couldn't bring myself to look up and meet his gaze.</p> <p>My body was tingling all over when the man was still sucking on his cock, still holding back a moan, still stroking himself. He turned around and I could see him staring at me as well. I started to sit up, realizing my skirt was still around my waist. He stopped stroking himself and looked back at me. He had the strangest look in his eyes. It was like he was afraid I was going to jump him. But I was afraid that his eyes would tell me to stop and let him fuck me. After thinking about this for a second, I decided to just get up and go to him.</p> <p>I took several steps forward. I wasn't sure how far I should go and suddenly felt ashamed again. It was like the first time I had ever gone to a stranger in my life, so scared to have sex with someone. But right now I was going to let him do whatever that had been to him, even if it meant my marriage. When I looked back at the man, I was not sure if I wanted him to stop. And then he looked back at me. He had a weird expression in his eyes, like he suddenly thought he had hit the jackpot with his father. I was sure that if he didn't look away I would just stop any more. He was probably right, but I was still ashamed about what I had done as well.</p> <p>It took some pleading on my part and before I knew it he had stopped what he was doing, sat back down, and then turned away from me. I saw him look quickly at the mirror in the corner. His body looked a lot better that his mother, and I felt even more ashamed. He kept watching me, but never said a word.</p> <p>There was one thing though. He would give me a blow job, or give me an orgasm, or even even fuck me. My head was spinning with all the thoughts that had been racing through my mind. I still wasn't convinced that my sex life could be anything like that between the two of them, even though they had given me blow jobs. But since I had agreed to meet him I felt it safe to do so. What was wrong with me? I got that feeling again, only I couldn't quite put that back.</p> <p>And what was wrong with me with some stranger doing this to me, being forced to suck his cock? After thinking about it for a while I saw in his eyes that I was losing it, lost in the pit of my stomach. He looked so good, and I couldn't help noticing his face, so handsome. And even though I knew I shouldn't have done it, I was so turned on I couldn't take it anymore.</p> <p>I looked down at my hands in front of me, still holding back my urge to look at my hands. I was getting excited again, thinking about this stranger looking down at meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
