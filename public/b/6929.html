Then, I took the lube from my pocket and put a squirt on her ass.</p> <p>"Here you go," I said. I poured a generous amount in my hand and rubbed the lubricant on her ass.</p> <p>"Oh, god!" she moaned, "that's hot!"</p> <p>I took a firm hold of both cheeks and spread them apart, exposing her cute little asshole. I placed her on her belly with her ass pointed in the air. I got between her legs and put the head of my cock against her ass.</p> <p>"Please don't do anything!" she pleaded, "I can't take it in!"</p> <p>"Relax," I said, "There's nothing wrong with that."</p> <p>I pressed against her, but the resistance was almost nonexistent. After some time of resistance, I slowly began to enter her.</p> <p>"Push it slowly!" she said.</p> <p>I did as she asked. Her anus didn't want to let go and it tightened around the head of my cock.</p> <p>"It's in!" she cried out.</p> <p>With that our bodies joined in a beautiful ballet of pleasure.</p> <p>"This is incredible!"</p> <p>Her ass was taking it all.</p> <p>"We should try," I said, "I have a special friend..."</p> <p>Then, "we'll do anything!"</p> <p>With that, she got up on all fours and asked, "Can I go to the couch?"</p> <p>"Sure," I replied.</p> <p>There is one thing that I have never experienced," she said, "I'm really sore after sex."</p> <p>"What a mess," I replied, "I'm going to take a bath and wash some of that sticky stuff out of my ass. There's a bottle of oil next to the bed."</p> <p>"But it's been a long day!"</p> <p>I picked the oil from the bed and brought it near my face.</p> <p>"Oh no," she said, "You're already rubbing my asshole again when it's dry!"</p> <p>I laughed and rubbed her asshole all over, starting at her waist and working up. All the way up to her upper back. I applied the oil and rubbed circles on her ass cheeks. She really enjoyed it. I had been doing the same things on her buttocks of late. I finished her ass and put my cock into her hole.</p> <p>"Hmmm, yes, " she murmured and moaned, "That's great!"</p> <p>I fucked her ass, pushing in and out at a steady pace. Each stroke got me closer and closer to my orgasm. Then, suddenly, I felt her entire weight on me, her legs around my waist, pressing her ass against my balls.</p> <p>"I'm coming!" I cried, "I'm coming in your ass!"</p> <p>I pushed her hard, coming in her ass as she came, squirting my sperm deep into her bowels. I held her in the air as my climax ebbed. The last thing I remember was us kissing and embracing, kissing each other passionately on the mouth and mouth. Once again, I fell asleep.</p> <p>I awoke with the sun shining in the mirror. I had a strange dream in which I was sucking a dildo but inside, my cock was hard. Then I had a flashback to when I had masturbated to the sight of my cock, in my bed, during the night. The feeling was strange. That dream felt so real. It was the first time I had seen any woman naked and the memory was exciting.</p> <p>I reached for the condom that the hotel provided me.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" I heard her call out in the darkness, "Time to go to the bathroomâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
