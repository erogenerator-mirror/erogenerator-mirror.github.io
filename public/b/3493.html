Then he got up, picked her up and lay her down on the bed. She still lay there on this bed naked.</p> <p>The man got in on the other side and was now lying naked on her side.</p> <p>"Now, how about we start with you first..." said the man in earnest now. "How about, well I think it would make a very erotic evening..." and he put a hand on the inside of her leg.</p> <p>"Oh man!" she exclaimed. "Don't tell anyone, not even my husband..." she said.</p> <p>The man smiled and took his hand away.</p> <p>"Now, what do you think about this?" he asked before turning around on Tanya.</p> <p>"It would be very sexy to find out if my husband could do it himself," she said.</p> <p>"Oh sure, I can be sure to do. No one ever goes alone, so I thought I would check first. What do you think? If it's alright to get undressed right away with me I'd be really curious to see it done."</p> <p>As Tanya said this she put her hand on the crotch of his jeans.</p> <p>Hans was in bed a minute or so ago and was in the bed watching the proceedings with his hand wrapped around his dick.</p> <p>When the man pulled his hand out from under Tanya's pants she didn't know what was going on. But she suddenly felt as if someone had just taken her against the back wall.</p> <p>The man who had put a hand on her leg and placed his finger in her cunt was now doing it right against her clitoris. She let her hand do the same as this.</p> <p>"Hhhmmmm," was the sound it made in Tanya.</p> <p>Just when the man felt like he had a nice erection Tanya found that her body was reacting too strongly. Her vagina was responding to the strange touch of this man.</p> <p>"Are you ready for the first time being inside me?" said the man to tease her. "Well, since this is a first for you I think it would be OK for us to do it before getting into that position..."</p> <p>"No thank you... I told you we were not that interested," Tanya said. "We don't want to get caught..."</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to fuck, darling?" he asked.</p> <p>She was looking into the mirror at what he was doing by the reflection of it.</p> <p>"Yes, I want to fuck." she said softly.</p> <p>"Well, I think that would be a good idea, you do realize that you'd be doing us both in a room that very soon."</p> <p>With that the man took hold of Tanya's right arm while the man now put his other hand on the back of her head and pushed it into his crotch.</p> <p>"There you go... relax while I get ready for our first time..." he said, rubbing his hard dick up against Tanya's face.</p> <p>His words only made her more excited. She thought she would have to get him to fuck her, now and that's exactly what she had to do when she could find another lover. But she knew that doing this was risky. That might ruin her marriage of twenty-five years.</p> <p>The man's dick had now become in hardness while Tanya's mouth was getting dry.</p> <p>"Please, put it back in, my husband probably will enjoy it too," she whispered as she started to breathe more heavily.</p> <p>"I didn't say you could do what I think you ought to do, darling," said the man who now started rubbing his dick against the back of her head. "So I guess it would help if you start to give it a massage...</p> <p>"You bet," he said as he lowered his head until it fell on Tanya's lips. It didn't take long for his dick to be in her mouth as she started to move her tongue inside his foreskin.</p> <p>In time that the man who had just rubbed her in the same way her face now was on his crotch while she kept her hand under the back of his hair while the man's tongue was now working in and around her clitoris.</p> <p>She couldn't believe how much her body was responding to the touch. Not only the sensation of sucking his dick, but also to his taste. It made her taste like a delicious wine.</p> <p>The man who wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
