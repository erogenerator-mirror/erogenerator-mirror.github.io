I can still see and feel what you're feeling right now." She kissed him deeply before running off into the house.</p> <p>"Damn, girl. Don't stop with that crap, you just aren't ready for that yet!"</p> <p>"I'm ready," she sighed, as she got up and ran back to the bedroom. She crawled back in without wasting any time. Just as she came to the edge of the bed, David reached down and grabbed the phone.</p> <p>"That will never happen," he said with an exasperated sigh. "What about your parents?" he asked as he went to the bed and flipped on the TV.</p> <p>"Your dad is going to freak out. Don't you think that's a good enough reason?" she asked, as she started to crawl back to him.</p> <p>"He'll be fine," he said sarcastically. "You're all he talks about."</p> <p>"I'm not going to be a bad person," she said between kisses of David's head on her way back up.</p> <p>"Yeah, you know what I mean. Trust you." He held the phone in his hand as he walked towards her. She watched as he walked towards her, his cock hard against her. "Come on," he said as he reached her, wrapping his strong frame around her, "I'm serious. I didn't have much choice in the matter. What do you think I would have said? A man is not allowed to go around with whores, and especially not ones that are married," he said, as he kissed her lips, "or have them," he added with a sly smile.</p> <p>Her hands flew to his shoulders as he broke the kiss. "Ohhh,"she said, running her fingers across his cheek. "I'm really glad you called and didn't force me to do anything more," she added, softly pressing her lips against his. He pulled her closer against him and reached down to start unbuttoning her shirt as she broke from him. He then helped her with her shirt and they both went back outside, still naked, and he sat on a chair by his window.</p> <p>"What are you doing," she sighed, as they went back inside, "You can't just keep me here and we're only getting started."</p> <p>"Just get naked and I'll finish what we started yesterday," he said, as he got up and walked to the closet. "I'm just about done," he said as he pulled clothes out. She walked back to him and dropped to her knees. He had a large, hard penis, standing at attention between his legs. She took a deep breath and licked his balls before sliding his cock back into her mouth, all the way, before pulling halfway up and back down. He groaned as she sucked him to make him cum faster.</p> <p>"I think it's been over fifteen minutes," he said, as he pulled her up into his arms. He kissed her deeply as he rolled her into the bed. He slid a finger into her wet pussy and fucked up and down as he wrapped her legs around his waist. Her moans encouraged him and he increased his pace. His fingers kept her moans up as he licked and bit on her nipples. He got off his knees and pulled her to her feet. After kissing her again, he turned her around and spread her legs. He pushed his face between her legs and licked her. "Mmmm," she moaned, as he got her worked up. Her pussy was so wet that he could feel her juices flowing down her legs onto his mouth. She moaned even louder as he pulled her lips aside and moved his tongue to her clit. "Ah God," she said as he began to lick faster. "Yes, yes," she cried, "Oh yes!" as he rubbed her clit. She came on his tongue as he inserted his fingers deeply into her as he finger-fucked her. She could feel herself getting close to climaxing as he increased his pace. She was about to cum again when she felt him pulling back.</p> <p>"Don't pull out," she said.</p> <p>"Not until I've cum," he said, as he crawled up her body. "Then I'm still going to go," he added, sliding his cock into her as she held him. She wrapped her legs around him tightly as he fucked her. He started pounding her hard into the bed as they kissed deeply again. They fucked long and fast as they took great care of cleaning up.</p> <p>"I haven't cum yet," she said, her hands on his ass, pulling him into her as he fucked up into her with every thrust. The sound of skin slapping as they made love filledâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
