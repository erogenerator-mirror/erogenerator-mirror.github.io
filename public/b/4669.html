She smiled. "Are you going to be able to do that for me sometime? I won't be too nervous."</p> <p>"I thought you knew." I kissed her forehead and pulled her into a hug. "I'll be okay."</p> <p>Chapter 7:</p> <p>We got out of bed, my arm around her as she hugged me. "I didn't get it though. You guys are not doing much. You're both out of condition to date, aren't you?"</p> <p>"We are doing some things different that you're willing to do that is very new to us too. It's not exactly new to us, but it happens from time to time." My wife said quietly in my ear as we walked.</p> <p>"I'm more experienced than you guys." I said as we got into bed. "We do some stuff we don't really do. You guys have a lot more experience with women than I do."</p> <p>"Well we do now." Sara's smile and her warm voice reminded me of my former love for women. "We have our share in the kitchen."</p> <p>"I'm glad, that means you're getting a kick out of it. I can't remember anything more erotic than my wife's oral sex."</p> <p>I pushed her onto her back, grabbed her by the hips and pushed into her pussy. She gasped and wiggled against me as I drove home, my hand on her thigh moving up to her waist. I pulled back and drove back in a few times before pulling out a little more and shoving in again. She groaned a little bit as I pulled her up to lie on her back.</p> <p>"I didn't feel it," she said as she rolled over on her side. "It felt strange at first."</p> <p>"I thought it did. I just hope I can make it this long with you." I thrust back into her and pulled over on her hip, making her groan again. "You like how it feels."</p> <p>"God, yes. I'm not sure I could do that anymore." She said as she leaned toward me and reached down to play with my half erect cock.</p> <p>"Well your new toy, which is much better when it goes in and out like you like. I like your new toy." I kissed her as I thrust against her. "My cock's going in you. We were just going to get you off."</p> <p>"Maybe." She sighed as she stroked me at the same rate. "You're too big."</p> <p>"I know. I'm not that big." I said as I moved over to lie beside her so we were side to side. She rolled onto her side and took me into her mouth in one stroke. I could feel my cock swell in her face as she bobbed up and down on me. I watched her pretty face as she brought me off.</p> <p>"Your wife is so good at that." I told her as I grabbed her by the hips and drove home again.</p> <p>"I know, but I'm not as good, I've only had her." Her eyes were a warm brown as she watched my face. "I couldn't believe how good it felt."</p> <p>"Want me to stop?" I had to laugh a little even though I was feeling more good about it.</p> <p>"It's really good with you, lover." She said as she got up off the bed and took off her night robe. She was in her panties and a teddy.</p> <p>"Can I touch you?"</p> <p>"Let's stop, before you're totally worn out." She gave me a kiss to get my attention as she reached down and pulled off the flimsy night gown. She stepped out of it and threw the night gown on the couch. I couldn't resist.</p> <p>"Wow. You sure do put on a good show." I said as I moved over and sat on her right leg. I put my hand on her stomach and slowly slid it upward until I got to her left breast. I didn't realize I'd gotten so nervous until it got me excited.</p> <p>"I don't know how you felt it, but you know how I feel." She turned her head at me. "Are you in pain?"</p> <p>"No. Not yet." I moved my hand to her tummy and moved it up there. "Did you like how it felt? Do you want to know?</p> <p>"Yes. I liked it."</p> <p>"Okay." I pulled my hand away and continued down her body as my hand moved upwards.</p> <p>"Do you have a boyfriend?"</p> <p>"We met in college a few years ago." She said softly. "We had a lot to talk about and you said you didn't think sex would be for you."</p> <p>"Oh, yeah." I said.
