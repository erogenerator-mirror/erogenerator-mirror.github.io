She felt so helpless to him, trapped by his body and she could not think of anything else. Her heart raced as her eyes locked on his.</p> <p>"Oh my gawd," she moaned when she felt him touch her thigh with his fingers.</p> <p>"Mmmm, you're so hot," he said as he pressed a kiss to her cheek. "Now, take off your pants and I mean ALL of yer clothes. I just want to play with yer naked tits, so I do not want yer pussy to be seen."</p> <p>"Mmmm..." she moaned, her legs beginning to quiver with excitement. Her body's reaction to his touch caused her to writhe to his touch. She felt so sexy now when she felt him touching her.</p> <p>"I want ye to stay naked, for me to touch any part of you," he said as he stepped aside so he could kneel right in front of her. "You can touch me anytime you want yer body to be touched." His hands stroked and his fingernails raked her bare skin as he stood there, inches from her face. She felt like he might touch her anywhere and she wanted him to. Her body was reacting to the touch. The thought of him in her naked skin felt naughty and exciting to her.</p> <p>"No, let me go," she moaned, knowing that if she didn't get out quickly things would go too fast and they would do things far worse than he was suggesting. Yet, she wanted him so badly.</p> <p>"Stay on your knees, honey," he commanded, his voice stern and hard. "I have a surprise for you tonight. For tonight, you were naked for me, remember? You were not wearing no undergarments!"</p> <p>She looked in awe at the naked woman kneeling in front of her, a man's hands caressing her body. She tried to reach back to her body for help to help protect her modesty but knew the hand was too late.</p> <p>"Please," she begged. "I...I've been naked all day. Please!"</p> <p>"Well, you can touch me, my pretty, now naked beauty!" He spoke to her in an intimidating manner. His tone and his tone were cruel, commanding. She could feel a twinge of fear and arousal from the words and the tone. She was not accustomed to such harsh treatment. How could he make such words so easy? But she did not need to ask.</p> <p>"You can do this for me now," he said with authority and looked her right in the eye. "I can make this fun for you, if you will do it for me." With that, he grabbed her arm and threw her onto the couch on her knees. "Ooooh!"</p> <p>She screamed, her body trembling as he brought the whip down hard against her naked back, leaving the skin even pinker and softer than before. He used the leather whip to slap and caress the exposed flesh of her exposed back and shoulders. She jumped at the sting as if she were struck by a whip. She could not believe that a woman would try to protect a woman from this man just because he was giving her a whipping.</p> <p>"This is getting you excited, isn't it, my sweet?" He mocked. "You're my girl now. Yer body's got me excited, now, is very excited and yes, you are a beautiful girl. Show me and don't play with yerself!"</p> <p>She felt helpless and yet excited at the same time at the same time. She was not thinking straight, for he knew she wanted this! How could he expect her to do anything if she did not want to do something that was so wrong? She felt a tingle between her legs and her pussy began to throb. She looked over to see him on his knees with his pants undone. And she wanted him. She wanted her body to respond to his touch, to let him know he was not a man to be taken advantage of and she wanted.</p> <p>"Yes," she said, in her throat, "I want this." She felt the thrill of anticipation running through her and it was a tremendous feeling.</p> <p>He looked up at her, his gaze still fixed on her, his eyes challenging her to do this in his presence, to be this vulnerable and vulnerable to him. But she knew she could not do this. She just had to do it and she wanted it anyway.</p> <p>She reached her hand out to take it with trembling fingers as he removed his trousers and she was struck by how beautiful it was to take his naked member into her hands.
