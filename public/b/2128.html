She asked with her own breath.</p> <p>"Just... Just give me a minute. You can't move now. You're still breathing and your head's still there. I'll be right back"</p> <p>She quickly turned and made her way to the bathroom and closed the door as I awoke, I was a little surprised as I found myself lying naked in the wet floor. I couldn't believe how aroused I was that my body was reacting to sleep and a woman's touch.</p> <p>I felt my legs start to quiver involuntarily as I started to rise up onto my elbows. I looked over and she was still lying there with her eyes closed and her face pressed into her pillow.</p> <p>"Did you like my touch?"</p> <p>My breath caught in my throat as I replied, "You... You were touching me!" I felt my cheeks burning as I realized that the feeling was something I was not sure if it had come from being touched or not.</p> <p>"I wasn't touching you. I was just making a comment." Her tone was filled with a hint of sadness as she continued, "You can move now but I'm going to wake you tomorrow if you want me to."</p> <p>I sat up, I really didn't feel like I was ready to leave but I felt compelled now to comply. I quickly got up on shaky legs as I thought about my feelings for my sweet angel. I had to keep taking this to an edge.</p> <p>I got to my feet without a word and made my way to the bathroom, I turned on the shower as I stepped in and closed my eyes. When the warm water hit my body I felt so guilty that it started to feel good. Slowly the washcloth washed over my naked body then made its way down, as the tender caresses traveled down my body my body became more sensitive.</p> <p>I so wanted it to start again and I got out of the shower, as I heard the door open. I took a deep cleansing breath of air and turned to face out of the shower. I noticed her head was in the other direction as she walked out of the bathroom.</p> <p>"That's not helping," I managed to say through the bathroom door.</p> <p>"You're getting tired. I have to find a job for tomorrow. I'm too embarrassed to have a shower in the first place tomorrow." Her voice sounded so much like hers.</p> <p>I watched as she looked at me with her eyes wide, "But my body is still there."</p> <p>That sounded worse than anything that I had said earlier but I couldn't figure out what to say. "Your body is still there? What can I do? I can't find a job tomorrow."</p> <p>She smiled and looked down at my still wet body. "You're too embarrassed and too tired to make a decision to get the job. I'm in the best frame of mind for you right now."</p> <p>I just stared at her and started to say something else, but I was speechless.</p> <p>"Please don't let it be true. I am only saying that it is more than that," she said as she slowly turned around to look at me.</p> <p>"I'm sorry honey." I quickly got dressed and went back to my bedroom with all the rest of the stuff that I had in our room.</p> <p>The next day I arrived at my job and tried to be a good host, my manager asked if I could be his temporary manager. I asked about the job and she told me that it was a good job and that she was excited to come out of her shell. The rest of my day was fairly uneventful. I was able to get a job with the local TV station which had some interesting channels. There were sports and a bunch of music channels, mostly the popular and some of the wild. I found some really interesting news reporting on the local weather that looked good and I got the day free.</p> <p>When I got home that evening I saw that it was getting dark by the time I got there. I was wondering what I had gotten myself into but when I got the door open I walked in and saw a huge bed with pillows stacked up on either side of it.</p> <p>"Beside of the bed now, lie down," she said as her head sank down on the pillows.</p> <p>I felt the room spin as I sat down and watched as she slowly got up off the bed and climbed up on it on all fours. "That's a good boy. Go ahead and get that cock hard and slide it all the way in while you look at the TV."</p> <p>I couldn't believe how loud she had gotten as I slowly turned the volume down and watched as she positioned herself overâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
