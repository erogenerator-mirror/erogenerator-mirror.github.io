He shrugged his shoulders and gave me a wink.</p> <p>"I'll be your slave tonight, slave."</p> <p>I smiled and nodded my head.</p> <p>I'm not one for sharing.</p> <p>He leaned forward and I got a whiff of his scent. The familiar scent I remembered, as the two days ago we'd spent in bed. Our eyes met.</p> <p>I'd said I wanted him.</p> <p>That was all I had. I'd said and I'm really sure I'd told him. But I don't recall asking for more. I'm not a lesbian, that kind of thing.</p> <p>"Oh, good. That's it. Now get over to the sofa and relax while I have a smoke." He grabbed my hair and dragged me over.</p> <p>"Not a problem." I let him pull me up into his arms and he held me down with his legs.</p> <p>There were other things he wanted to do, and I knew how much he needed to do them once he was done with me. He took a long drag from his cigarette and blew the smoke into my face then his eyes were wide. I just leaned my head against him and closed my eyes again.</p> <p>"Do you trust me?"</p> <p>My knees weakened with desire. "Yeah."</p> <p>"Then we can be even. You have to let me go."</p> <p>No, this is it. "I can't do this."</p> <p>He reached out and lightly ran his palm up my stomach. I inhaled sharply then he pulled me up closer.</p> <p>"Don't you have to let me go at night?"</p> <p>"What? What are you talking about?"</p> <p>"You have to let me go to bed before we begin. Don't you remember last night?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I remember."</p> <p>It's not fair, but I couldn't.</p> <p>"You have to let me go before we begin to do it."</p> <p>No, I can't.</p> <p>"Let me go before we begin to do it." He was shaking his head, like a little boy. "I thought you trusted me. I didn't expect that from you."</p> <p>"I don't know what you mean."</p> <p>"I think you're trying to make me do this, but you can stop me anytime I want to stop."</p> <p>"I can't. Please."</p> <p>God, I was so afraid.</p> <p>"How about right now?" He looked at me.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I said 'let me go'. You have to let me go before we begin. I didn't mean like this. I didn't mean for anything to happen today."</p> <p>My eyes widened. "You didn't say anything."</p> <p>"You did, but not 'let me go'. When would you want to do it without me?"</p> <p>"But I don't have to let you go. I don't have to be alone, and the way I want you to, I would really like that. But not with you."</p> <p>"I know. I'm sorry."</p> <p>I held my breath for a moment and felt myself starting to shake slightly. This had to be an elaborate plot of his, and if anything came out, we would both lose whatever amount of control I felt we had over him. The fact that I could lose control so easily was killing me.</p> <p>"I just want to do it with you. I'm not doing this on my own."</p> <p>"Are you still thinking about it? Are you still sure that you don't want to stop me from doing this?"</p> <p>I didn't realize it at the time, but he was talking to me. His lips had gone slightly wet with his pre cum and I could tell he was still trying to decide.</p> <p>"Are you serious?" He was looking up at me with a smile that must have been somewhere between a smile and a frown. "I wasn't thinking a lot about my own actions."</p> <p>I laughed, I liked that laugh. "Are you serious?"</p> <p>"I'm seriously considering stopping by your place tomorrow for some more sex. Do you think you could come by my apartment tomorrow?"</p> <p>I had to stop smiling. "I think I would love to. I mean, I know you have an ex-boyfriend. But that's not what I meant."</p> <p>"Well, I'm going to have to be more specific." I thought about his point and then sighed. "So what is your name anywayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
