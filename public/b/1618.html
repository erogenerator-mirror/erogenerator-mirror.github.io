It was filled with all kinds of goodies in all different sizes but at one time just the most gorgeous and sexy woman I have ever seen. Her long brown hair was falling forward over her right eye. She was wearing a light colored summer dress and it was the hottest time of the summer. Even though I had seen her in so many outfits at my house she still had the alluring beauty of her body out of that little town.</p> <p>She was looking for some panties so I took a chance and looked at her beautiful legs. There was very little under that dress and it showed quite a lot. I was able to see right down the center of the dress and when she spread her legs a little I could see her pink cunt.</p> <p>I picked up the bag quickly and made the right move. I dropped the bag down and quickly stripped off the duffel.</p> <p>I looked at her sexy body with the dress now half way on. I walked into the kitchen area a few seconds and then turned around, bent down and pulled her dress down to her waist and then turned her back to me.</p> <p>"Well, what are you waiting for?" she asked with a smile.</p> <p>"I want to see those tits"</p> <p>I kissed her neck and ran my hands over both breasts as I lifted them up and gently squeezed them and rolled her pink nipples. They got quite aroused and I just wanted more. I quickly dropped down to my knees and grabbed the crotch and then ran my hands over her stomach and slowly up to her pussy. I could feel my face buried in her panties as I worked to remove them.</p> <p>"Oh, Oh, Oh, please. You are driving me wild." Her voice was begging for mercy.</p> <p>Then I slipped her panties off and tossed them on the floor along with the dress.</p> <p>"Oh, your cock looks so big!" She said as it bobbed up and down.</p> <p>I reached my hand up to cup her cunt and used both hands on her to rub her clit. At the same time I slipped my tongue into her pussy and was rewarded with more of a sweet tasting nectar. As soon as my tongue went into her honey hole a small wave of cum appeared.</p> <p>"Oh, I never knew it would get this good!" I thought.</p> <p>Her body began to shake and quiver. That was all it took and I was gone. I drove my cock into her as far as I could go. With each stroke she squirmed and pushed back to meet me. Just like before it felt like heaven. When the urge to cum subsided I pulled out and laid her on her back. I quickly pulled off her shoes and then pulled off her dress and panties so she could lie down.</p> <p>I leaned down and kissed her thighs again before getting between them. I took one more taste of her creamy cunt as I drove my cock deep into her cunt with only the second stroke. Once in I began to really bang her pussy. We fucked for a long time. I didn't see anything that would excite me as much as her pussy but she did and it was great.</p> <p>The look on her face was of pure ecstasy and I couldn't hold back any longer and came with a tremendous roar. I pulled out and lay on her. Her breasts were a little bigger than my own but we enjoyed each others company.</p> <p>It was a fantastic feeling to be with someone other than my wife. Just before I went to sleep I told her that I loved her.</p> <p>She didn't object and I wondered if she knew that I love her.</p> <p>The next morning she seemed content but also very sad. I felt so sorry for her and for me. At first she seemed sad that there wasn't enough satisfaction for both of us, but when I talked about getting together again it was an awesome weight lifted off of her.</p> <p>Even though she had told me she was going to do something to make me happy I still didn't know what. I'm sure she had told you but I really didn't care. She was the cutest woman I had ever known. I am going to do the same thing I did for so many years. Maybe tomorrow morning, it'll be betterâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
