Maybe if you showed up there, I wouldn't have to wear it, and you wouldn't have to go with me anymore."</p> <p>"Don't think so."</p> <p>"I...don't!"</p> <p>"I'm telling you what to do, and in return, I'm telling you what's going to happen."</p> <p>Dale was confused. Here was this incredible, sexy woman talking to him, and he thought this was all a bit crazy. But before he could protest, the woman's hand wrapped around his cock, and gave it a healthy pumping motion. The look of pleasure and pleasure that flashed through her eyes were indescribably beautiful and her touch was unbelievable. The look and feel of her hand around his cock was incredible. He was on the verge of losing control when he felt the woman's hand slide off, and down his cock. The warmth, the slickness, her soft fingertips pressing the head as she pumped was the most erotic thing he'd ever felt in his life. And then, once again, the warmth of the woman's hand disappeared, and the motion stopped.</p> <p>Dale sat there on the edge of the bed. The woman was a very strange woman, a rare occurrence for the tall and lean man standing at the top of the stairs, who appeared to be a handsome man. He could just imagine how he would look with a woman, and how much he'd enjoy fucking her in the shower in whatever position she wanted. That thought was too faraway to keep. In his mind it was almost a dream.</p> <p>Dale sat there, trying to get his thoughts to someplace where he could get up and go and fuck the woman next to him. But the woman held her hand on his cock, gently stroking him softly but firmly as though she was afraid he'd get excited. It was like a feather light touch, with the most delicate caress. She was doing it so he could see where it went, and what she was doing. Dale was getting so turned on that he was beginning to fear he'd shoot his load prematurely, if it was possible though.</p> <p>"There are some things in your past that you wouldn't have done if you'd known what was going to happen," the woman said, "but today you are going to find out for yourself, and you're going to make it."</p> <p>She leaned over Dale's body, her hands cupping him, and he felt her breath on his chest. Her fingers were lightly touching over his thighs, and he could tell she was going to caress the head of his cock. And she was going to stroke him. Dale reached a hand up to touch her cheek.</p> <p>"There's no one in this room except you," she told him.</p> <p>Dale couldn't hold back anymore. He could hold out no longer. A part of him wanted to just take it, hold her and pull her into his lap, and fuck her right there in the shower. To just let her have it at last. But it was more than that. There was a part of him, with a sense of obligation, and he didn't want that. He didn't want to think he could have sex. He just wanted to hold her in his arms while the hot water ran over them. He wasn't sure how it all felt, but once again he was lost in the bliss of his own sexuality.</p> <p>"Oh damn," he breathed.</p> <p>"Don't hold back."</p> <p>Dale didn't need reminding of what was coming next. He was in a dream world, completely naked and in her arms on the floor of the hotel room, which had always been a great place to be a man. There was another long pause, but it was more a sort of awkwardness than anything else. They had never really talked about it. Even though it was very natural for her to be attracted to him, he never really considered himself to be a bad person. But then again, he was attracted to women; he never had a doubt about that. He might have been a virgin, but he wasn't a virgin by any means. He didn't think that many people would ever even think they were a good enough candidate to actually get it on with. He was not like most men in that regard, and certainly not the type who was either into kissing a woman or a woman doing the same with him. But in the end, the question for him and the woman was what were the chances for this.</p> <p>Then the woman's hand wrapped down the front of her body and grabbed a handful of her pubic hair, stroking it lightly. Dale was stunned. He had never had anyone do that before.</p> <p>"I don't..." he stammered, then stopped.</p> <p>"I don't believe you, Dale," the woman responded. And then, without breakingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
