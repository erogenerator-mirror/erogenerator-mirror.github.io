A little later, I pull her up beside me and bend down to kiss her softly on the lips. "I have something special for you tomorrow. You're going to love it. And then I'm going to make it so."</p> <p>"I will. Thank you," she says and we hold each other and kiss a little longer. My arms around her are a little too tight, and she can feel my chest pressed against hers. I'm glad I picked her top since she isn't getting any when she leaves. Otherwise, I'm going to be a sweaty mess in a while.</p> <p>"I will," I whisper against her lips and she shivers.</p> <p>Then I am turning away and going upstairs to do what I want to do the best thing I can. I do my best to get her to leave the house and not do what I want to do. I just hope she doesn't start getting hungry in the morning. I will never tell her how much she has to eat or how much she can drink. So, I'm running some errands while she is gone.</p> <p>I just love how fast the house seems to grow during these things. It feels as though the building is taking on bigger proportions. She is now out of town. She's already been out on a date with some guy. They are all gone. Then, in the middle of a nice dinner I am doing a little shopping. I bring in a new shirt, a new bathing suit, and several pairs of nice shorts and tops to keep me warm. She's gone with two guys. They are already in. I get her things and we go into my room.</p> <p>"Where is my new swim suit?" She asks pulling me towards the changing room.</p> <p>"Down there," I say, pointing in front. She smiles.</p> <p>She runs a towel into the changing room and lays it on the bench next to her. "This is fine," she says. Then, with a bit of hesitation, she reaches down and pulls her towel up to her waist. "No, you don't have to," I say and she smiles. But, she doesn't.</p> <p>"You're not going to argue? Or do I have to tell you that it's fine?" I ask and I shake my head. I take her face in my hands lightly and look deep into her eyes. "I am not going to say that you're going to argue about anything, but there is an important difference between arguing with me versus arguing with you." My lips brush hers. "And that's why I'm going to make it so." I pull her to me, feel her small body, and she smiles. "I have to teach you to resist," I say between kisses. And, I reach down to her bottom and pull her to me so she is sitting on my lap. Her hands are on my shoulders. I start to slide them up her tight ass and feel the curve in her hips and ass. I slowly start to unbutton her top.</p> <p>"No," she says. I pull it away from her small body. I can feel her naked breasts against my chest and feel her nipples pressing down. She starts to pull away but I grab her hips instead. "I'm not going anywhere tonight. Just sit back and enjoy what I'm going to do. I'm about to take it all off. There is no stopping me."</p> <p>"Oh, really you want to take it all, so do I."</p> <p>I look into her eyes and then drop a nipple that comes into view, and she smiles. "I want to take you all off." I see the lust in her eyes but I don't care. I can't stop myself.</p> <p>I turn around to walk away, holding her by the hips. I start to pull her shorts further down her legs, leaving just enough of her ass and mound exposed to me. She is still breathing heavily. I slide my fingers up her thighs, over her hips and into the dip between her thigh. She shivers as I tickle her clit. She spreads her legs just slightly. I slide my fingers up and over her clit. She groans, so I pull her closer. Then, I pull them away. "No," she whispers, and I push her legs together as hard as I can, making her pussy lips pop out. I slide my lips down and over her pussy. She groans louder and shivers. I slide down slowly and tease her clit with my lips, lips, and tongue. She groans, I groan, I groan and she is going nuts. She starts to shake and grinds against me. She starts to come and I can't hold back any longer. I push her legs open even more and slide my cock upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
