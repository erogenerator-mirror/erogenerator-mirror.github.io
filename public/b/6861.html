I asked.</p> <p>"Maybe, but not tonight."</p> <p>"Oh," I said as I handed her a few of the wine coolers from the cabinet. "I'm going to start it tonight."</p> <p>She gave me a sly smile and took the glasses and glasses I was holding tightly. And just like that she was in my body.</p> <p>I had no intention of stopping her from going to "work." I took one of the glasses and, as her eyes locked on mine, slowly opened my shirt and lowered it. We were both completely naked and I could feel my cock pushing against her thigh. She took that as an invitation she moved her hand down to my cock and slowly rubbed it along the edge of her pussy lips. That is until she was surprised, "Ahh" escaped my lips and it caused me to groan. She looked up at me and smiled knowingly.</p> <p>I took a long gulp of wine and handed her the glasses before taking her hand in mine and helping her up. I followed her up the stairs behind her carrying her glasses between my two fingers. As the door closes I turn to her and smiled as the lights of my flat began to come on. "You want to stay in." I asked. "You know it's not a choice, it's a privilege."</p> <p>"I agree, I'm sorry."</p> <p>"I know, it is no trouble for me," I kissed her lightly on her cheek before leading her to the bed. She looked up at me and gave a playful wink before she kissed me gently on the lips. I gently pushed her onto her back as my mouth trailed down her neck and she groaned at my touch. My hands reached down into her cleavage and I gently pulled her bra away from her and her nipples were instantly erect. She squirmed excitedly as I continued to tease them through the lace of her bra. "Oh God," she said softly as this sent me over the edge as I softly bit the soft fabric of her bra in between my teeth. I let my tongue slide over her firm nipple before I let my fingers lightly trace the material of her panties and as my mouth made contact with her hard nipple I let my hands slip inside to softly stroke her hot, wet bush before moving back down and softly running my finger up her stomach to her panties. I let the tips of my finger brush against her clit and she shuddered.</p> <p>"Oh God. Stop," she husked.</p> <p>"Why?" I asked. "It's not a choice you know..."</p> <p>"Stop, just please, just take them off! I want to feel you," she moaned as I gently slipped them off her with a quick movement of my hands.</p> <p>"I've dreamed of doing this for a long time," I said as I knelt on the bed beside her and gently lowered myself down so my face was just above hers. I lifted her face up to meet mine. Our first kiss was tentative at first, it was hot and passionate at the same time, but then I got more serious and I began to kiss her softly through her open bra where her nipples could be seen through the lace. Her breasts were pressed up against mine and I could feel the hardness of her nipples pressing into the soft satin that was covering them. Then I let my hands fall to her waist and with one motion I pulled her up to me so she was sitting at my knees in front of me. She smiled at me and as she moved to sit on the edge of the bed, I held her tight between my legs as I brought my lips up to hers before I kissed her again.</p> <p>Again my hands slid from her waist down across her breasts and around her hips to cup her ass as they slipped in between us to caress her belly through her panties. As she pulled my mouth down to her hard nipple with her tongue it was too much for the pressure she felt as it seemed to swell even more and her hand left my mouth to slide down to my now rock hard cock and rub it up and down the shaft. I was already so hard she just barely managed to touch the tip with her fingertips before I pulled her away to lie down on the bed. With her back turned me so I could reach between her legs but she quickly pushed me away saying "No, not there." Then she went to the drawer and brought out a length of lube and returned. I heard her gasp when she found some on the bottom of her bottle of warming water. She slid it over my cock and said "Let me get the cap off first." As she moved off the bed she leaned over me and held the bottle to my lips so I just sucked on the tip until my lips and tongue found and began to lick up her slick juices. I could feel her hand gently rubbing my cock and it felt so good.
