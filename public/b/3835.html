"Did they look like what you've got?"</p> <p>"Yeah, he's the younger of the two," he said, "I guess I'm just a little nervous about what to expect."</p> <p>"He's not your boyfriend," she argued, "He's a guy I don't think you might recognize. You don't need to be nervous, just do what he says."</p> <p>"Maybe so, but, you know, I just wonder if I can still feel a thing. Is that a little strange?"</p> <p>"Don't be silly," he replied, "you look great, if you don't like it. I don't think you should have anyone staring at your chest either, and as for me, my heart is beating so fast, why don't you just keep walking into the club and grab a drink? I'll even go and pick something out for you."</p> <p>"Okay, I'll see you in a couple hours. Here," she said, "Let me go change into something more comfortable for my date so that he can check me out when he gets back."</p> <p>"Oh, you don't have to do that," he said, "I don't think I could have been any more nervous if you'd said anything like that."</p> <p>"I know," she replied and turned and walked around the apartment to the door.</p> <p>As she stepped outside, she heard the door open and then his voice. "Where are you going, girl?" he asked, "Come on in, we've got some unfinished business!"</p> <p>She stood there for a few moments, listening in on both sides of the two guys that had been walking up from the bar to the door and her boss from the front desk as they approached and then she turned back to him. "It's okay, Tim," she started, "Go on in. I'll be by in a few minutes."</p> <p>He smiled as he walked back inside. "Good, thanks," he said, "See you in a few minutes, sweetheart."</p> <p>"Yeah, bye lover," she replied, "I'll see you in a few."</p> <p>She closed the apartment door and walked down the hallway to her bedroom. As she opened the door, she noticed that the light was still on in her room. She walked into her bedroom and looked over her shoulder. The room was still lit by the single bulb in the middle and there on her dresser sat a note. On top the card was an address and a phone number. She pulled the piece of paper out of the drawer inside.</p> <p>"That's an offer," she said matter of factly.</p> <p>"I'll bet."</p> <p>"Do you want an extra little surprise?"</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I heard in the newspaper that he gave one of the clients a free night," she said, "I think that's his reward for that good night and the fact that he did well. So, what are you looking forward to?"</p> <p>"I don't know," he replied. "I was expecting to be in your arms or just sitting there all night or something."</p> <p>"You wouldn't be in my arms like it's been a long time?"</p> <p>"Nope," he replied simply, "What's up with the club now?"</p> <p>"Well," she said, "I think that maybe the two of us should go out and have a few drinks before we go upstairs."</p> <p>"Really? That's the plan?"</p> <p>"Yeah," she replied, "But let's do it first. We need to know how we feel about each other and what we feel for each other. What do you think?"</p> <p>"It's kind of exciting," he said, "but you know I don't want to do that, right?"</p> <p>"I know," she nodded, "But there's no rush. There's no pressure, just have fun."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Positive," she answered, "But I'll never forget this day either."</p> <p>"I promise," he said, "I really hope that you'll be there."</p> <p>"I'll be," she agreed, "I just think it seems a little silly in some ways, but when we go upstairs the first time, youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
