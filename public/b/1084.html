I think at some point she just woke up. I was concerned she might be suicidal again. I wasn't exactly worried about anything other than her in all their glory.</p> <p>That night she went back to her bed. The next morning she went upstairs to the bathroom and knocked. I could tell she was upset. The door was closed and she was in bed next to me. I don't know what happened or why she wasn't in bed. Either way she didn't say or do anything, but she slept or slept and I didn't do anything to help.</p> <p>I was in bed with Sam and we kept kissing and I started thinking about what we did the first night we started that ritual when we got drunk. I think we both started feeling frisky and started doing things to each other. It was one of the only things that I ever heard Sam do while we were at college. She made me cum several times while we kissed.</p> <p>As I was saying that Sam had been telling me about that night. I was feeling jealous about how Sam and I were acting the first night we dated. Sam just told me something about it last night. I just had trouble believing that this was happening but I guess it was.</p> <p>Sam was in my bed and I was playing with her pussy. I had a feeling we were having the same feelings but I had no way of knowing what that would lead to. I think Sam was thinking about how different our lives were. I guess my subconscious was trying to tell me that we were going to try out what that was about. For example, it worked for me but my mind has trouble thinking like that.</p> <p>After I was done touching her I had to take a shower. I did everything I could to try to hide my jealousy or guilt on that side but it was all part of my new reality.</p> <p>Chapter 2 - The Beginning</p> <p>Sam is in my bed sleeping again and she doesn't talk much. I guess I am still horny too. I didn't know what I was about to do next but I am going to try. I know that once I have it in me I am already having a good time and I have a feeling the plan is working.</p> <p>Sam had already turned over onto her side facing me. I slid my hand over her body and found her nipple. I started to pin it between my fingers and rolled it around. She was really getting turned on when she started to get this funny look in her eyes. She started making noises then and then started to kiss me more. She had her hand down between us again so I got my hand up under her nightgown and started pinching her nipple again.</p> <p>I don't remember what I was doing that first night but what happened was like someone was going to pull on it and I would move off of her body if I could. I was feeling a little dizzy so I stopped a little before she felt it. In fact, she had no idea what I had just done until I started to twist her nipple and it hurt and she kind of turned her face towards me.</p> <p>"Let me show you something," I said as I kissed her softly on the mouth and then moved down to suck her nipple in my mouth. I had her gasping for air and when I bit down on her nipple as hard as I could I could hear her crying. Sam just didn't stop kissing me and moaning and moving her hands and her body from all of her excitement.</p> <p>Sam and I kept kissing. I think she was still crying. We didn't stop for another minute. I slid lower on the bed. I didn't want her to know how far I was going to let this go.</p> <p>I moved my head down her body and found her pussy. I didn't take a chance licking her and she didn't say anything. She kept saying those things. She was so hot for me.</p> <p>"I think it's time to make some noise," she gasped out.</p> <p>I started to rub her pussy while I sucked her nipples and she was getting louder with each stroke. She was rocking her hips slightly and I started to rub harder. Her body was shaking in my hands and all of a sudden I let go with both of us moaning. It was the most beautiful orgasm I have ever had.</p> <p>Sam started to cry and her legs started to shake again. At the same time I gave her the biggest orgasm I have ever had. I am sure there is a lot more orgasms that you can do between a woman and a man than on a boy but to her it felt just wonderful. She started rocking her hips faster again and soon I had to let go of her nipples while she jerked on the bed and I went back to doing what I was doing.</p> <p>She cried out loud again and began a wild scream.
