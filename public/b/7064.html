He shouted as he shoved his cock all the way into me and grunted the word out.</p> <p>"Yes!" I shouted and with his grunting I could see his eyes rolling back into his head, and it was all I could do to hang on as he started to go off in me.</p> <p>We both slowed at the same time as he stopped, the first spurt was almost a long one, but I was not complaining since it was coming at me. His cum covered my hands as we both caught our breath.</p> <p>"Mmmm" he said, "It's good to start from scratch." He said, and he pulled his softening cock out of my ass.</p> <p>"Are you going to tell Mr. Adams?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm going to keep doing this the rest of the evening." He said and I knew we would have sex again soon.</p> <p>"Maybe, why not?" I said and we both walked back to the dorm.</p> <p>*â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
