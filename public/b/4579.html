She didn’t mind either. In fact, it excited her. This was so wrong. She had loved Tom like she had loved her two husbands, and she wanted to have a child so, maybe, it’s wrong. She knew it was wrong. The truth was, although at a certain point, she had enjoyed sex with him, she had also enjoyed being with other men. She thought it was wrong, too, but when the opportunity presented itself, she quickly realized she did want – no, need – a child. But Tom’s cock was her responsibility alone. It was no substitute for Tom, her sex partner. As long as she was here she just wanted to be alone. With Tom as her man, no one would know, but she wanted to be with him.</p> <p>She was in awe. Here she was, lying in bed totally naked and looking at a woman’s vagina, a woman’s woman, a woman’s vagina. She had dreamed of this moment for more than five years, but now, she knew what she wanted, where to touch and how to touch it. She remembered every moment. When Tom first moved towards her she jumped, startled. But somehow she felt as if she belonged here. She realized that she was naked, of course. That’s true, of course it was. She never did. That was just the way sex was done in the dark. For sure, Heather would never be ready again for him, or any other man. All women needed men.</p> <p>After having been to bed hundreds of times, Heather became aware of another voice, from the other side of her bed. It was a voice that she was not familiar with. It was familiar somehow. But there was something else, too. Something familiar and compelling. It told her that Heather was ready for this new, exciting adventure. It told her that she loved being with the sexual touch of another man, a new, exciting adventure. What it held for her was something she’d never suspected. It told her that she wanted to go that way and that she was not yet truly ready.</p> <p>Tom was so familiar with her vagina. He could see it clearly. He could remember it. He could sense her excitement and her excitement because of how she opened her eyes. His mouth was close by her and when he kissed her tenderly, she responded. He did this, kissed her everywhere, from her breasts to her lips, back and through. Heather closed her eyes again. She closed her eyes again. Tom had taken charge of her. She’d been with other guys before and had had no illusions he’d go for her, no reservations and no commitments.</p> <p>Tom had kissed his way down Heather’s body. He would take his time, very carefully as he did so. He would taste Heather for the very first time. She was lovely, her soft skin. He longed for her, she was so enticing and he longed for her to be his. Heather felt his tongue touch her and the kiss, a long, sensual kiss, was all she could have hoped it would be. Tom’s tongue traced her, and it traced her.</p> <p>She felt his tongue on her breasts and she became aware of his mouth on her breasts and his mouth on her nipples and to her breasts and his tongue was on her nipples. Her legs opened wider, inviting his mouth on her. So, when Heather felt Tom’s large, soft, wet mouth press against her vagina, her heart beat and her pussy began to moisten. The sensation was so erotic. Heather wanted, no, she needed. She needed Tom's mouth and his tongue on her and on her.</p> <p>Tom’s mouth was kissing Heather, and as his tongue touched her, his body responded. Tom’s penis was hard and erect. Tom’s organ was hard and long and thick. Tom’s hardness touched Heather. It seemed every nerve in Heather’s sex could feel it. Her hand ran through his hair. There, Tom’s face, his mouth, his tongue. There, Heather had her face pressed against him. Tom responded. He thrust his hips forward and Heather responded. She could feel their organs move together. Tom’s hardness rubbed against her with every motion of his body. She had her hand on his penis. She had her hand around his hardness. Heather had her hand around him.</p> <p>Tom was lying next to Heather. She was looking at him, admiring his face with her eyes. He wasn’t speaking but just looking at her. She felt his hardness, and at the moment, she could not believe how it made her feel to just be looked at. There was a sense of love that she hadn’t felt in years.
