I wondered where it had come from...</p> <p>A few minutes later the phone ringtone, and the answering service switched to a different signal. I saw her hands move to the wall as I sat quietly. Her face broke into a wide grin and a tear rolled down her cheek, but she had a concerned expression on her face as she picked up. "That's the service. I answered it at the office, but I can't get out."</p> <p>I took a deep breath and said, "It's not what I signed up for, but it's the first time. You know how it is. I know there has to be some kind of emotional connection between father and daughter. It's just that you're doing so well, at the same time, but the real connection is... it's just not what I signed up for. The truth is, at the very least I don't want sex anymore."</p> <p>She sat there for a long moment. Her words took me by surprise. There was no sadness or regret in them. This was a motherly kind of love. I thought for a long moment. This was my mother. "I know. You've been with a man before, and he is still as amazing as he is when he gives you an orgasm. Don't worry. There is no emotional connection. But you're not doing it in the right way. Not here. Not with dad. You love your son more than you love your children. Don't ruin your life going to hell."</p> <p>She looked at me and her arms encircled me, but she didn't look at the ring on the receiver. A few minutes later she was back in bed. "That was the hardest thing I have ever done," I said as she got in my bed next to me. "To tell you the truth, I have been worried. For the last year and a half."</p> <p>"Me too," she said quietly. "I'm sorry honey. And I know we have been through everything. I wish I could say you won't get to see me anymore. I want you and dad to be happy. I know we are just a bit different, but for the longest time I was afraid..."</p> <p>"I don't care anymore," I said, and she smiled and wrapped her arms around me. There was a silence that lasted several seconds as if it felt endless. Finally, she spoke, "I really love you, you know. Dad doesn't."</p> <p>"I know," I said. "It's just that I am afraid of what might happen if we do anything together."</p> <p>And there was a pause and then she moved to kiss me. "Will we be getting married someday?" she asked as she kissed me. "You probably won't have any children, but I'm in love with you, and if this thing between us ends I'm going to be able to do that too."</p> <p>"We'll be getting married in September, at Christmas," I said. "I don't want to do anything to hurt you, but we certainly have not got to the point where you're afraid of getting pregnant."</p> <p>"You're right," she said, and she kissed me again. "It will be a good years for us, but the fact that it won't really hurt is another factor."</p> <p>I wasn't sure whether that was a statement or not, but I felt her hand move from my thigh to caress my cock. "I've got to tell you, though," she said softly as she kissed me. "I think my hormones are starting to get the best of me."</p> <p>I was feeling extremely guilty. I had betrayed my wife and children so badly that by simply coming out and admitting it I felt so guilty. "I forgive you," I said as I tried to get up the nerve to come on her.</p> <p>My wife smiled sweetly. "You forgive me, Daddy, but it'll be our secret. When dad gets home, I hope he doesn't get to watch!"</p> <p>I leaned over and kissed her on the cheek. "You bet!"</p> <p>I didn't have to wait much longer than two more days, but this happened too fast, and soon we were getting ready for our wedding. When she and dad arrived our parents hugged us, and a whole lot of the other bridesmaids and bridesmaids started heading to the reception. I didn't know if it was going to be a big event or a small thing, but when I got home my wife, I'm sure, had no idea what to say. "I'm going to love you forever, Daddy," she smiled, and our parents joined us in the kitchen. After we each had a beer, dad and I sat down to talk.
