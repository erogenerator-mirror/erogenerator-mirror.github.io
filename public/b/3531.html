He said softly and she smiled at him and he leaned in to her and kissed her hard against her closed lips and she responded. Her tongue pushed into his mouth and he held the kiss; it was the only thing making her feel better. Her hand came up to touch his cheek and she smiled again seeing how much she loved it. His hands left her hands and traveled all over her body, touching where his hands touched; she liked it, her fingertips felt so soft and yet firm. Moving up her body they kissed again and she could see his eyes staring at her breasts. She turned her head to allow him access as she reached down to touch herself. The head of his rigid member was in her hand as he sat there kissing her.</p> <p>"Mmmmmm, mmmmmm. Mmmmmm, mmmmmm, this is so nice." She leaned into him and could feel his hardness as she kissed him.</p> <p>"I can't believe we're actually here, we're both adults," he said as he looked at her now and smiled. She moved on top of him and kissed him again as his arms surrounded her; her body pressing against his. She could feel his erection under her and it made her feel so hot and heavy.</p> <p>"Mmmm, I can't believe this is happening. Are you sure about this?" she asked her mouth still on his and she could feel his arms holding her while his hands roamed their bodies.</p> <p>"I'm sure baby, you know I love you to, so do I know you love me. But this time, you know what you have to do."</p> <p>"Yes, I know what I want." She said knowing he was lying. He reached down and she felt his fingers on her belly, stroking lightly. Her skin quivered at his touch and she loved it. Pulling her mouth from his his she smiled and kissed him again.</p> <p>"If you think this is going to happen again, you're crazy." She smiled and kissed him again as they lay there with his arm draped around her. "So I'll just have to wait and see how things end after the week is over."</p> <p>"Mmmmmm, yes." He lifted her back up to lay on top of his body. Lifting her hips again he kissed her on her mouth. Her tongue met his once more as he lifted her back up and lowered her onto his erection again. He kissed her as his hands felt up and down her body and she could feel herself getting close to yet another climax. He lifted her again, lifting her body so they could kiss again and he moved to hold her legs apart. She wrapped one around his waist so they could kiss.</p> <p>"Mmmmmm, this is nice." She moaned as he kissed her, her hand holding his head there while she felt the hardness of his erection. She squeezed it and felt it, it felt so hard and so hard between her legs.</p> <p>"Mmmmm, that feels wonderful." He replied. He held onto her as he let go. Feeling her body relax, he slowly lifted himself up until he was almost out of her and then slammed back in to make her gasp. She didn't have the first orgasm of the night, but as he had his second one he felt so turned on by seeing her face as he drove into her again. They kissed and moaned as her hand took its own grip on his body. She knew he loved it when she did that. Her mouth opened as her orgasm neared and she felt it on its way, not yet having fully finished.</p> <p>"Mmmm, Oh God." She moaned, her eyes closing as the sensation swept over her. She started having another orgasm as his body continued to move within her. Then, he stopped, and slowly, gently, began moving within her again.</p> <p>"Oh Yes, Oh God, Oh my god, this is wonderful." She said as she felt his weight on her again.</p> <p>"Oh my god woman, you are so beautiful." He said as he held her. He kissed her lips softly, "I love you so much." He said as his hand stroked her tummy to calm her. He felt her tremble as he held her. "I love you very much, I love you and what you can do for me."</p> <p>"That's great, mmmmmm, it feels so good to see you, yes, yes." She said and felt his hand move from her tummy and down, feeling the length and thickness of her body as it moved below her.</p> <p>"Oh, so wonderful." His hand found her hips and he rolled them over making her smile. "Mmmm." He whispered. He began lifting up to push fully out of her, feeling her tremble and feeling her come down once more.
