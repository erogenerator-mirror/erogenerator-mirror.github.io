Now make us cum." she said as she ground her pelvis against me and her fingers worked her hot, swollen pussy. "God, yes. Yes, Master. I cumming. Please, Master, may I cum?"</p> <p>I did.</p> <p>I looked down at her legs and she was leaning up with her face pressing against her hand. The first spurt of my cum shot out my body in an arc that left her hand and leg on high display. More and more went from her fingers - I lost count - and my hands, to her thighs. More and more went into her hand, her fingers and, to her palm, there were little jets of cum from my cumming fingers.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, Master," she said. "I had hoped so." Again the hand had shot out another huge stream, and more of the second spurts landed on her face and across her cheeks, and she looked up at me with that shy smile.</p> <p>"Clean it," I told her, my eyes still locked on her hand to the last drops of cum she had just caught. "Now, I'm getting a little more comfortable. I think we should get back to work. I hope you like working for me."</p> <p>"Now," she told me, her hand still stroking her pussy as she looked up with lust. "Thank you, Master. Do we have a deal?" she asked.</p> <p>"As long as you are honest."</p> <p>"Yes, Master. I'm very honest."</p> <p>"OK, then, go to the bathroom. I'll put some clothes on."</p> <p>She took a big, slow swallow of wine and stood up. I followed her, and we washed off all the cum and then put on a short negligee. We dressed and I handed her a business card. "My name is Richard H. I'll be your next door neighbor."</p> <p>"A pleasure and a service, Master. I will come and see you." She said.</p> <p>"Yes. I'm sure. I have a special place in mind."</p> <p>"I'll call you, Master."</p> <p>"If you do, you can come to my place anytime after nine."</p> <p>"Yes, I will."</p> <p>"Now, go."</p> <p>Chapter 7</p> <p>I rang the doorbell at nine in the afternoon, and there was no answer. I took several large steps nervously on my three feet and found myself looking around, hoping, praying, and praying that she would never come back. I stood at the bottom of the steps and waited. Finally, after what seemed like forty, or maybe more I must have been three or four minutes I heard the door open and the sound of the doorbell ringing.</p> <p>"Come in, come in, I'm glad you're here." she said. "Now take off the negligee and get naked."</p> <p>I hesitated again, but then dropped the negligee and pulled it over my head. I couldn't help myself. I'm not sure, maybe twenty pounds heavier than that, but I still felt my cock start to swell. "Come in, come in. Sit down." she said. "I'll be up for a minute. Please sit down." she said as she stood.</p> <p>She got two of the three wooden chairs and sitting in them got some cushions and a couple of pillows. She started to unbutton her blouse and I could almost see her breasts from several miles away, and, of course, I could see her breasts as she sat.</p> <p>"OK, then, put it on." she said after standing, and when I was standing it took almost but a second, and it was the sort of thing where a person could be able to look, like she could look up a tree. "Just lean against it and get comfortable," she said, adding another small pillow.</p> <p>I leaned against the chair and put my forearms against the top of the cushion. "I feel really embarrassed," I said, looking down at the cushion against my arm.</p> <p>"You look beautiful, my love," she said. I was looking at her cleavage, I mean really looking, and she could see right through me, but, there they were.</p> <p>"It's a very beautiful thing to wear," she said. "It really does help me blend in and not be so much obvious. I also love to look at you. It shows a lot of skin and it takes a lot of courage to put on so much makeup. You can see the lines on your forehead through the blouse. See how red it gets as I apply it."</p> <p>I could feel my cock starting to expand again and, as she had said, when she finished she stood up and came to face me. My erection was clearly visible. She reached out and ran her fingers up and down my arm, thenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
