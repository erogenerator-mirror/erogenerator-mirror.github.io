I can't just tell anybody about this! It would be the first time someone finds out about my sexual exploits, especially if I was the last man they had sex with!"</p> <p>"I'll do whatever I can," she replied, with a small smile.</p> <p>"Oh, stop!"</p> <p>"My only consolation is my parents' will kill me if I tell them," she added. "But I'm not going to tell them!"</p> <p>"No, stay right here," Sam commanded. "I might just turn up this time!"</p> <p>She got off the bed, grabbed a robe and walked out to her room. Moments later, she was back in the bedroom, alone and with a strange smile on her face and the key hanging on the key chain. She grabbed the key.</p> <p>"I'm not going to do this. You're not going to have any one of my friends over. I am not going to have a fling with a bunch of them. I'm not going to have sex! You and I are going to get married, you're not going to have any one of my friends over!"</p> <p>"No, I can't do this. I don't have to do this. You know I'm not going to tell anyone. And I'm not sure where this will lead me."</p> <p>"Do you really think I want to talk to a bunch of guys about it? You're certainly not going to have sex with a bunch of other guys, are you? That means I have to stay in this room. It's time I got started somewhere else!"</p> <p>"Fine, you're the only one that can take your mind off the door." She picked up the key chain and swung it around. "Come out to the door!"</p> <p>She did, and she walked slowly into the bedroom. Once they reached the bed, he turned her around, and took her in his arms. "Are you ready?" he asked. "Will you fuck me?"</p> <p>He kissed her. She parted her lips and let his tongue taste her lips. He sucked for a moment and then said, "I want to go slow and make love to you slowly."</p> <p>She smiled as he kissed her and his hands explored her body, taking her blouse off. His fingers teased her breasts, and then slipped under her bra and cupped her tits. Her nipples grew hard as he caressed her.</p> <p>"I really like you," he said while kissing down her neck and to her chest. "You're so beautiful and I love how aroused you get when you get excited. You feel so different every time."</p> <p>"I don't just get aroused, Sam!" she moaned into his mouth.</p> <p>He kissed all around her bra, and then went to her tits and sucked her nipples in. It tickled her; it made them grow hard and puffy. She reached down to his pants and undid his zipper. When he broke away from her to do so, she unbuttoned his pants and pulled them down. He stepped out of them, and she pulled his briefs off. When she looked down, she saw that he was fully erect.</p> <p>She took her mouth back to his cock, and began to suck him. She started with his cock, going faster and deeper into her mouth. She took the head of his cock into her throat. She pulled her mouth off of him, but then let him go.</p> <p>"That's enough," he commanded, and grabbed her panties. He pulled them down her legs and tossed them aside.</p> <p>He pushed her down onto the bed. She spread her legs for him, and he lay between them. He took his cock in his hand and rubbed it up and down her lips. He then placed the head at the entrance of her pussy. She smiled when she felt his head pass through her opening.</p> <p>"Slowly," she said.</p> <p>"Slowly," he commanded with a smile.</p> <p>He slid the head of his cock into her. She lifted her hips to help with the penetration. She pushed against him with her hips as he slid in.</p> <p>Once he was in, he began to move within her.</p> <p>She said, "I want you inside me."</p> <p>Sam began to move in her, slow and easy, pulling almost all the way out as she told him, getting the full effect of his movements until she had completely taken all of him. She lifted her hips more, making him move back just a bit. He stopped and said, "You can have more with me."</p> <p>She lifted her legs and pulled them up over his shoulders, then held onto the bed for a minute so that she could get more of him. Her legs were pressed against his chest. He kissed the inside of her thighs and pulled her hips closer to him. One hand was holding her hip, the other ran up and down her body.
