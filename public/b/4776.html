He kissed my lips and let his hands move down my sides. Then, he moved his lips to the side of my neck and slowly moved it lower to a place that made my head tinge with his soft kisses. We started moving slowly, caressing each other's legs with our bodies as our minds went through the motions of a dance we had started. His hands moved around behind me and I felt his body against mine, feeling his body up against my own. He slid his hands up around my body, then around my shoulders, and then slid them around to my back. He pulled me to him, sliding one hand along my skin, down my back and back up again and around around around my neck.</p> <p>"Oi," I giggled.</p> <p>"Mmm?" he said, "I know it's early, but what are your plans for tonight? I wanted to do something for you."</p> <p>He kissed my lips. I didn't realize how silly that sounded. He kissed my neck, then up to my lips and they kissed. He kissed me again, lightly and sensuously. I felt good about him. We went to the bed as lovers. We undressed like lovers in a movie.</p> <p>"I guess it's time to really get going," I said as I broke the kiss and smiled at him. "Why don't we have a shower and go back to bed and have our fun?"</p> <p>I kissed him again and he turned towards me. I took his cock in my hand and moved myself onto the bed. He came towards me and I pushed him back. He turned into me and I went to him and our lips met for the first time. We kissed as if we would never stop. There was a feeling of complete connection to each other that was beyond words. I pulled his cock to me and he bent his back to me, pulling me onto his shoulder. He pulled me on top of him and I straddled him as he lay on his back in the bed. I held and kissed his cock and took him deep within me. I rocked myself on and off him in long, slow movements.</p> <p>"O god," he said softly. "Oh, baby."</p> <p>He ran his hands up my body to my breasts and he caressed each one in turn as he squeezed and teased my nipples. I moaned and felt his cock swell within me. I pushed my bottom against him and felt his hand move down and slide under the fabric of my panties. He slid his finger over my clitoris, then down from bottom to top, and back up. I pushed against his hand and ground against his finger. My breathing quickened and my back arched.</p> <p>I had come back to reality when I felt him slip his fingers into the waistband of my underwear. He pulled them down to my ankles. I kicked away my panties and bent my legs at the knees to get them over the floor. He quickly removed them and the panties and, kneeling on the bed, lowered himself between my legs.</p> <p>"I can see you, baby," he said. He kissed me again. We kissed and he lapped at my breasts as his hands kneaded and teased them. He worked his tongue slowly around on each nipple, rolling and pinching them gently. Then he licked a line down between my breasts. I arched forward and grabbed the back of it as he sucked my nipples in between his teeth. He slid his tongue between my breasts, circling slowly towards one nipple after another. He licked and sucked on them, and then slid down across my breasts to my stomach. He took a nipple into his mouth, but kept it there a minute. He sucked on my other nipple a couple of times, and then slid his head down my body until he was between my thighs. He paused a brief moment and looked up at me. I was biting my lips as he lowered himself to the knees between my legs. I gasped when he kissed me lightly on the lips. I ran my fingers over his hair.</p> <p>"We've got lots to explore together," I said as I ran my hand across his cheek, leaving a trail of goose bumps along his skin, in his hair. I spread his hair so that if either of us was going to touch anything else, it would all be revealed in full view. I lowered my mouth to his. Our kiss was slow and passionate, as if we were savoring each other's lips and tongues. My hands went to his hair as I pulled him to me, crushing mine into the bed. He kissed me harder still, sucking on my lips and tongue. I could feel his breath on my mouth, on my neck as he moved his fingertips down, across my breasts, to my nipples. One of his hands took one between his fingers and thumb and rolled my nipples gently.
