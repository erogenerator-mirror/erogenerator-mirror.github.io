We had taken one of those little private swimming pools in the house on the weekend. As I cleaned up the pool area, I looked around. The pool had some tables and some patio chairs. It looked as if there were quite a few people in the pool.</p> <p>After I finished cleaning off the pool area, I found my jacket. Since it was in the dark by now, I thought I'd check out the patio. There were several patio tables in the room, two pool tables and a small table near the outside wall with a low table on one side. There was a low table near the edge of the pool.</p> <p>Sitting beside the pool table, I looked out toward a small group of people. One of them was a girl about my age. She was dressed in a dark blue sundress. The sundress had a halter neck with a very thin strap hanging from the strap. The dress was cut low in back and the back almost covered her ass showing off her lower back.</p> <p>The dress was cut almost to her hips and she had to be pushing her tits up against the fabric. She was very short. She had on high heels. She had her face close to the pool table. My eye line was up to my chest. I looked over and saw that both of her tits were clearly visible through the thin cloth top.</p> <p>She appeared to be chatting with another couple on the far side of the pool. She had her back towards me. Another guy, who was about my age was sitting at the high table with his partner. I couldn't really tell as they were talking away.</p> <p>I had looked over at Beth for a second and got it. She wasn't really at the pool table though. She looked at me and I gave her a smile. She turned around and looked back at her partner. As she turned back to her friends, she raised a hand to her mouth and started to laugh. The guy in the deep dark dress had stopped talking and was looking at her. Beth was still smiling. Suddenly my curiosity got the better of me and I quickly stepped down and headed towards the side of the pool. The other people seemed to be still talking.</p> <p>As I made sure I had made it just within reach, I got on my knees. I took one hand of the guy at the table next to where Beth was sitting and walked over to her. Beth looked up and laughed at me. Her face was bright red. I pulled her close to me.</p> <p>"What is all that laughter about?" I asked.</p> <p>She looked back at the guy at the table. "This guy is really good. He is so nice."</p> <p>I pulled on her free hand and pulled her close. "Come on in. If you want something to drink, you can have a beer."</p> <p>As my hand went to the back of her neck, she took mine and quickly lifted herself up. I let her have her beer and followed after her back to the other person. Before I got it though, I realized the guy at the table had been watching her all the way down.</p> <p>"You sure about that?" Beth asked.</p> <p>"Oh yeah. And you seem to enjoy watching her. She is really very sexy."</p> <p>We were walking back towards the pool in her heels. I had her stand on one finger and hold the edge of the pool table with one foot. As I pulled the table and two chairs over next to me, I looked up at her. I wasn't just standing by the pool with her and my cock was very obvious. Beth kept smiling and holding up her glass to her friend.</p> <p>Our steps slowed down. I had my hand over hers as I looked her over. Her eyes were smiling as much as I was. She had her hand on mine as we got closer to the pool table. I had my hand behind her neck as I looked over and back up at her. Beth's eyes met mine.</p> <p>She put her hand on mine and slowly pushed it back to the table. She reached up with her foot and slowly rubbed my hand. "You like?" she asked.</p> <p>I grinned over at her. "It is a little cold outside."</p> <p>She reached down with her other foot and rubbed mine. "I bet it is."</p> <p>"Why don't we get it warmed up in a little while. You can rub something off me if you want."</p> <p>She stood there for a long minute. Her legs were trembling from holding herself on the pool table and now her hand on mine. "How . . . how do you want things?" she said.</p> <p>I got it.</p> <p>"Well, the other way first."</p> <p>That caused Beth's legs to shake even more. She looked over to see what the idea as she turned around toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
