We need to go back to the camp. You know you want to," the captain told her, "but this is the last time. We're not going to let you leave here without experiencing what that little episode could have brought about. Now go."</p> <p>The rest of the ride was uneventful, except for when the captain had to take it back to camp. That was another story, but this time a great and worthwhile one.</p> <p>They arrived back at the castle. "We had good luck," the captain said, "but still. I hope you had a splendid rest for the night." She turned and led the way back to the camp.</p> <p>For the first time in a couple hours, Elizabeth saw the other slaves walking out the door. And she looked at the guards walking around the camp. She remembered being at the wedding. She remembered their faces. But, she did not care. She was still young and she would be very happy to have her family back. She could still be happy.</p> <p>She reached out and grabbed the captain, "Wait!" she cried, "They'll be there next week, they'll be here in time to see you and your ship!"</p> <p>The captain looked at she before turning to the guards. They all quickly made a break for the gates, and headed for the ship. Elizabeth was relieved that the captain didn't get into the ship, but she wasn't in the mood for all of the gossip. She would have stayed on the ship for the rest of her life if she hadn't been so wound up.</p> <p>And she wasn't sure how much she wanted to do something about it; she didn't want to be the centre of attention tonight. That was probably the worse part of it all.</p> <p>All of the women of the kingdom came down at some point to see what the event was about. Elizabeth was the first to speak up, "Are those women there?" she asked.</p> <p>The captain smiled. She looked at the other women. They all saw that Elizabeth was a little upset. "I want to apologize. I'm still a little upset when I see it, but I didn't know. I've just thought it was best if I got a chance to see what happened today."</p> <p>The captain thought that that might do a little good, but it wasn't going to be all that much, was it? And the guard couldn't give up the chance for her. "My wife is right here," the captain said, "I'm sorry, but your wife is also a royal. She can only do in a marriage by herself, and she can't do this without trying. She's my wife not yours, and you're my wife. Do what you like. Let her handle it."</p> <p>The captain looked at the guards and said, "These people are not your wives. It isn't your place to act as their slave. It's your duty to do as you are told, and you'll do exactly as they tell you. I want to apologize for getting into a discussion about it, but I'll find a way to get your attention if you do this for us."</p> <p>Everyone but the captain was quiet for a moment and then turned to her. She looked into the captain's eyes, and saw the real fear reflected there. She took one of the guards' hands and began to lead him to the gate next to the camp. She looked back and saw the rest of the guards moving and headed for it. She grabbed the guards' heads and yanked them back. "Get out of here. I think your wife's back." she ordered them.</p> <p>The soldiers were running off, but the captain didn't have a clue. She could feel the fear in them, but they wouldn't even look at her. Her eyes narrowed, she saw they could do nothing else than what they were. The captain wasn't a coward, she knew she was too strong. They tried to flee quickly, but just barely managed to get to the gate. She couldn't help but smile as they ran out of the gate.</p> <p>Her eyes narrowed. She looked over at a guard and saw it looking around, too. She grabbed the guard's head and yanked it back. This wasn't a gentle task. She twisted the head so she could smash it to the ground. Her fingers were now tingly. She yanked hard again, and this time she saw that they didn't turn at all.</p> <p>The captain smiled at her and walked around to the back of the camp where she had left the rest of the slaves. She went behind the guard and pulled, the head. It turned and dropped on the ground. The guard let out an involuntary cry. "I'm back," she whispered, "I'll always be your wife."</p> <p>She smiledâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
