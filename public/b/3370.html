He could hardly wait as he stripped to his underwear before sitting down on his bed and starting to masturbate. He had a big erection that threatened to rip through his underwear, but he was happy to relax under the full body spray of the heat. It wasn't that he was homophobic anymore, just that he couldn't really remember when it had happened.</p> <p>As the first wave of heat washed over him he got a little restless as he watched porn and imagined. Eventually he rolled over so that he was on the bottom before moving up towards him. He felt the warm spray as he put one foot on the mattress; his balls were drawn up tightly. He was thinking about the weekend, but then he realized his own desire wasn't as intense as it would have been. For some reason it just didn't feel as good.</p> <p>He had been lucky though to be able to last until his cock had been fully engorged but his hand moved quickly. He was hard and his balls were tight and he could feel his excitement building. He had never been able to last more than he was and his erection had only gotten harder but it was still a great start to the weekend. He had a slight panic and his first thought was to just get up but then remembered that he had a job to do before his boss came in.</p> <p>He reached his hand up to his penis and immediately felt him tense. Normally he wouldn't orgasm so quickly after ejaculating but not with the feeling of his own release so close. He didn't think he could hold off any longer. His hand was shaking in his excitement just a little as he started to feel the warm flow of his sperm move through his shaft. "That's so good," he quietly moaned out as he started to move his hand a little faster. His hips pushed back and then a little and it was just the beginning. The warm, slightly salty fluid began to run down the outside of his penis. His balls tightened and his hand stopped moving. He could feel his heart pounding and his legs would have collapsed if he could have.</p> <p>When he felt his hand stop he looked over at it. It had a small trail of his sticky fluid all down his wrist and the end of his penis and a small drop on the end of it. "Damn," he thought to himself and then reached out and took his balls in his hand. They felt loose and heavy. He wanted to rub them a little but he didn't want to make himself cum and it wasn't the first time. At that time he couldn't remember cumming. He had had too much already.</p> <p>He could feel his semen running down his chest and he wondered if he was going to be able to stand this much longer. He had to hurry if this was going to work. He decided to try and get him off faster. It was pretty hot that night as the water was running over it as he started to stroke. He wanted to get his hand on all the way but he thought he could still get it. "I'm almost there," he told himself as he moved over to the wall and began to pump.</p> <p>Once again his orgasm was small but now he was pushing his head down towards the ceiling but he had one more load of cum left and he couldn't really feel anything through it. He moaned as it ended but continued to press his head all the way down the wall. It was still warm but there was a slightly different feel to it. It was definitely different but he didn't care. He felt his cock get harder and harder after he began to hump the wall but he had another load of it coming this time. "I guess I'm next," he thought to himself as his hand got tired but he didn't remember cumming so suddenly. For it he managed to keep a grip on his ball sack as his balls tightened even more.</p> <p>He came for two seconds and as it subsided he felt the warm flow begin to run to his legs. He felt a warm glow in his stomach now. It had lasted only a couple minutes and as he closed his eyes there was a warmth in his groin that he couldn't remember before. He smiled at his hand stroking himself. He was still smiling as he moved over to his bathroom and stood in front of the toilet and he had a warm wash cloth he always used for cleaning himself. He used it to wipe his cock and the head of it all but it was just so warm and it helped relieve some of the pressure he felt he was starting to feel about his life just now. He didn't think it was possible to get tired of using it all before he had sex so he just took the wash cloth and washed his face. Then he used the wash cloth to clean his dick but he was far from done cleaning his balls. He ran it back up his penisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
