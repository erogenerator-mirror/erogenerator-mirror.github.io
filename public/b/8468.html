She said and got up to get our drinks from the fridge. "Mmm, I can't wait." She said as she bent down to pour our drinks. I followed her and took the glasses. As she went to get me my eyes were locked to her ass. She stopped midway and turned around so she could put the drink to her mouth. I stared at her breasts for a second, and then looked at her hands, which she took out of her pants and reached around to undo her top. She was really starting to heat up, and I wondered what she was doing with her hands. She stopped suddenly and sat back down, as she reached behind and undid her pants, letting them drop on the floor. She had panties on, and I could see her bare pussy, which was glistening with moistness. "Ohh." She said, her legs slightly apart. I watched appreciatively as she reached between her legs and brought her fingers to her mouth and put them to her mouth, showing me that she was still wearing her panties.</p> <p>"I thought for sure we would be going to bed." I said and turned back to my beer. She stood up again, took the drink and placed it on the couch.</p> <p>"Come on." She said, getting my attention. I stood up and was glad to see that my penis was fully hard. But, she stopped before I could leave. I reached and she looked at me, seeing the excitement on my face. She reached over and took my hand. I followed her eyes, and as we walked to her room, she turned, put her hand behind my neck, and pulled it gently to her lips. With her other hand, she pulled the panties from her cunt, exposing her sex to me. She pushed my hands to my sides and pushed me towards the bedroom, with my hands in her panties rubbing her clit through the satiny fabric of her panties.</p> <p>"Wow." As we left the bedroom, I saw that the door was closed and she was already naked except for her panties. I went to stand on the bed and she put one of her legs over the side of mine. She got some rope from her bedroom, and tied my hands with my back to the bed posts. She tied my legs to the other side of the bed, leaving my ass up in the air. She took a rubber ball out, and began to stroke my balls with the rubber. I let the feeling wash over me, and I knew that maybe if I were lucky, she would want me to cum, too. I relaxed and let her do all the work. She took off the rubber ball and wiped it on my chest hair. She then got some rope and wrapped it around me, tying it to the bed post. Next, she pulled my balls gently away, exposing them and me to her. I leaned against the bed, knowing that it was going to be painful at first, but not knowing if I couldn't cum. She leaned against me and began to suck my cock and balls, which was stiffening almost too much. I could smell blood, and I felt as good. She got off, and we came together, both getting so excited that we both had tears in our eyes and tears in both our mouths. And, she wiped the blood and spit on her shirt. We held each other for a moment, feeling that we just had what we needed, what we had wanted. And, she was too exhausted to move from me. When her breathing calmed down, she pulled me to her and hugged me close to her, my semi-hard cock still trapped against her belly. We kissed passionately, and then fell asleep with me half-on one of her many arm and leg cushions in the middle of the bed.</p> <p>When I awoke, it was dark outside, a light was blinking in the bathroom. I didn't even get off the bed to pee. I heard the shower stop, and I was not sure. I remembered that I had to be hard and ready for at least 6:00 a.m., so I got in my pants, and got dressed. Then my phone rang. I picked up the receiver, but there was nothing on it. I answered it and heard her voice.</p> <p>"Good morning!"</p> <p>"Good morning." My wife said with relief.</p> <p>"Good morning." I responded, wondering what she was up to.</p> <p>"Have you gone to your parents' house this morning?" she asked.</p> <p>"No." I replied, and then stopped mid-sentence as I looked at her face.</p> <p>"Oh, I have, I've had to go to a conference, and I don't feel like I can do anything."</p> <p>"Okay," I answered, still puzzled by what she was doing.</p> <p>"Can you come over this afternoon? We can go to the restaurant, have drinks, and watchâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
