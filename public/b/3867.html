She whispered in his ear. He could swear she sounded more aroused than when he had come in her mouth. "I love you!" She whispered.</p> <p>He leaned back against the bedroom door, sliding his hands over her hips and over her small breasts, cupping them through the sheer top. She felt so smooth to him. "I do love you." She moaned as he lifted her top up and off as he began to gently lick her nipples, rolling them between his tongue and lips as she slid her hand down and around the cock in his pants.</p> <p>"You do love me. Don't you?" He asked as he slid his hand over her flat stomach, finding her panties already damp.</p> <p>"God yes, I can't wait." She responded as she slipped his hand under her skirt, holding it up in the air as his fingers moved over her, feeling the warmth as she slid down her panties. "I need you inside me, now."</p> <p>She spread her legs and let him stand up in front of her, her eyes still on the door of his underwear. He looked down, her thighs parting and he saw her damp curls between her legs.</p> <p>"Mmm... I almost forgot how much I love your body, Anna." He whispered. He pulled her to him, his hand sliding down her stomach again as he felt her breath begin to waft in his ear, the wetness of her lips making his erection rock. She was so wet, he was sure he was dripping a little down her thighs as he cupped her breast in his hand, squeezing and massaging it as he felt her fingers on his skin.</p> <p>"I love you." She said as she reached down between her legs, sliding his erection between her lips as he slid himself into the warm depths of her core.</p> <p>He began to move slowly into her, moving inside the soft, wet tunnel of her sex as she gasped softly. He pulled her back to him as she leaned her head back against his shoulder, her hair falling softly to touch his collarbone. He kissed down her neck, nibbling at her neck as he kissed her, feeling her trembling body on his as he worked his cock deeper inside her. Her breasts were full and flushed and quivering as her fingers ran over his face, her nipples growing harder against his lips as she moaned. He began to gently move inside her again, his hips pumping his hardness up into her as she writhed beneath him. She pushed her hips up against him as he slid his fingers, feeling her body clench around his cock even as her breasts shook and quivered in his hands.</p> <p>"I love you." He whispered. He felt his body tremble as she closed her eyes, her lips pressing lightly against his neck as she felt her climax slowly building in her belly. Finally, her eyes opened to meet his as she gasped softly. "Oh god, Jason, yes, yes!" She moaned as his cock drove deep into her, feeling his hot sperm splash into her as she felt him pulse and spasm with his orgasm.</p> <p>She came hard, her body shaking as he pulled himself tight against her. He slid his finger out of her as he slowly slid himself back out, his cock slowly and gently sliding out. As he slid himself out of her, she stood on her feet, her hair covering most of her face as she looked up at him. "Oh god." She said, staring into his deep blue eyes, his expression and smile a little uncertain as she looked down to see his cock standing right up in front of her.</p> <p>"It's mine." He whispered to her, reaching out his hand to lead it to her face before he reached around her, lifting her gently and holding her tight against him. Their kisses were full and heavy as her hands caressed his face. He turned them so he was looking down to where they held each other, and his hands slid out from under hers as he slowly walked to the bed.</p> <p>Karen lay with her head on his shoulder as he took his shoes off, walking down the bed with her, as she watched him move through the kitchen, her head still on his shoulder as he went through the door. She closed her eyes as he turned to kiss her gently on her red lips as he sat on her bed with his right leg over the left, his cock standing up proudly and pointing straight at her. Karen felt her body tremble as she watched him slip his pants and jeans down and out of the closet as he stood in front of her, pulling her right hand to his cock as he moved his right leg up and over the left, pulling it up against his body as his head was buried in her neck.
