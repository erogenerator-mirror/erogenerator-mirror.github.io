I couldn't really say anymore. It was the way she acted as I was. The way her body writhed and wiggled as we kissed. Her hand dropped to my chest from which I could neither feel nor hear. Then, with a soft 'Yes' from her lips, I felt her fingers slip through the wet cotton of my shirt and squeeze my left nipple as my arousal mounted to an agonizingly agonizing level. I was unable to tell if she was even aware that she was touching me, nor if she actually knew at all; I simply could not think of anything at that point.</p> <p>And then it was over. She was pulling the shirt off of me and it slipped in the darkness of her room. I could feel her body pressing against mine. I could feel her legs, clad in black cloth, wrapping around my mid thigh. She kissed me all over. I kissed her back, her neck and finally her face - the first she kissed since the kiss.</p> <p>At last she broke the kiss. "I want to make love, Eric. I need to make love and I don't care who you are, but we have to leave right now so as soon as we leave, I'm going to try and enjoy myself, and I want you to love me when we do."</p> <p>I sat up, the sheet pulled up in my lap, her naked body pressing against me, like a predator taking cover in the forest under her predator's shadow and in my arms. And she took a soft kiss to my cheek.</p> <p>"I love you too, Eric." And with that she pushed away the sheet and she was completely naked, her body glistening from the light that penetrated from a couple of small lamps at her front door.</p> <p>As I looked at her, she said more softly, "I want you to take me now." And with that she crawled backward on the bed while still covering her self with the covers. And with that she parted her legs and I saw her pink, puffy outer lips within the curls that now hid them.</p> <p>As I crawled onto the bed, I slid my now rampant shaft between those luscious lips and within seconds I had entered her completely to the hilt. It was the most intensely sensuous moment of my life.</p> <p>I slid my own fingers into her hair to feel the silks of her fine hair, as I pulled her back to me and she reached for my hands to hold them there as we kissed longingly. I started to pump my hips to meet hers, wanting to make love to her now.</p> <p>We kissed like lovers. We kissed as if I was fucking her myself. And I thrust into her with such energy that I feared I would tear her. I was a sexual being and I had lost myself so utterly within her that it took all of my might to not just pound into her. I wanted to be sure that what we were were lovemaking with each other, because the intensity was so intense, that I so feared that if I came before her, that somehow we would not be able to be together, and I would not be able to hold back my eruption of sexual bliss to tell her how deeply I loved her, because the desire to make love with her was such a consuming and demanding need I did not, do not expect that we would never be able to get it out of our systems so that our life-blood could not be transferred from where it should live.</p> <p>I had already broken through that barrier before. She was different than any woman I had ever known. She was all woman. I thought of her as a goddess, a god. But I was her lover. So there was no way I would abandon her.</p> <p>We kissed softly as if making love rather than like animals, and the sensations that flowed into both of us were indescribably exquisite. There was an overwhelming sense of urgency in each of our bodies' desire for one another yet to find that they could not separate and they could find the same ecstasy that we would receive.</p> <p>And then I saw a look that I have only ever seen on a lover's face. It was intense. In that moment, I am sure that there was not an ounce of confusion or guilt that I felt. All I felt was passion and love and desire and want. So much, but not just the sex. I saw the love flowing from her. I felt her. I felt her passion. I felt her desire.</p> <p>We kissed long and deep, but with a sense of urgency and urgency we both recognized. We understood each other's love and desire and wanted to make it our own. We kissed for a long time, and then began to stroke each other's bodies under the covers.</p> <p>Soon we were both breathing deeply, our bodies feeling warm and soft; bodies that I feltâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
