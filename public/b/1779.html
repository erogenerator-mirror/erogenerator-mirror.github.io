"Amy, would you like to go out for coffee?" I asked.</p> <p>She looked up at me with her eyes almost watery and said. "I guess that would be fun."</p> <p>After a few moments of talking, they both agreed it would be a good idea. We went out to the patio and sat down on the patio chairs. I took in what I saw and decided I would go with it and continue to think about my life.</p> <p>They each pulled their shirts off and Amy's bra came off. Her nipples were standing proud and proud, so I told her to lie down. She did and then she started to kiss me passionately and when she got to my ear said "I want to do it again."</p> <p>I kissed her long and deep and we embraced very passionately before laying to one side of each other. We rolled around in the bed until I was on my back. She straddled me and started to undo my pants. I asked her to give me a quickie because I really needed to cum but she just laughed and climbed off so that I could get my cock out.</p> <p>I was lying there while she got down and started to suck me off while the head of my cock was still in her mouth. After about ten minutes, she started to go faster and I started to feel that familiar feeling building in my cock. In between her sucking me off and the feeling of my cum starting to rise to the tip, she stopped for a little bit and said. "I want you to cum in my mouth."</p> <p>I told her no that my cock was too sensitive and that I didn't want her to finish me off at that point so that I could go back on her later. We went back to sucking each other till I was hard again. She was already getting up off me before I got my cock back inside her. And when it was hard again I told her she was going to do it again.</p> <p>She straddled me again and I told her to lean back against me as I started to move forward between her legs so that I could get my cock in her again. Once I got my cock inside of her again I asked her to hold still as I began to slide myself in and out of her. She was having a hard time with her breathing and had trouble maintaining one orgasm for me. She was panting each time as I thrust myself into her. But the feeling of her tightness around the end of my cock was the best. I knew it wouldn't be long before I came.</p> <p>I asked her if I could cum inside of her again and she said yes. I told her I would love to cum in her pussy and I felt her pussy grip me as I started to pump in and out of her again. She started to move around a little more so that I could feel some movement in her pussy from my cock inside of her. She started to rub her nipples back and forth hard until I started to feel my cock pulsing as I shot my load into her.</p> <p>We lay like that for a bit before both of us started to get up. We kissed and let some of our juices run down her legs before we kissed one another some more. The taste of our juices and the heat of our passion was sweet. I went outside and I think both of us just fell asleep there for some time before we got up and got dressed.</p> <p>Sometime in the wee hours, I woke up sometime during the night and saw the little clock next to the door. I put my finger to my lips to wake up Amy once more and she opened the door just a crack. "Good morning," she said softly as she got up to take the door and walked over to it. When she got close to it I asked her what she wanted. She gave me a quick one before she said "I want you to go to the bathroom real quick."</p> <p>I went out while she was getting up, but after a quick glance over I saw she had already gone. She was waiting by the bath. She grabbed the soap and started to run it over me, paying particular attention to my cock. She moved down to my cock and started to rub it a little as she washed me. I was starting to get hard again as she started to wash my balls. Then she moved up to my cock and started to rub it a little.</p> <p>After a minute she moved her hands up to my chest and started to pull down the top of my shirt. She leaned in to kiss me as she pushed my shirt up out of the way and then leaned over and started to rub my chest with the soap. She rubbed down along the sides and started to do the side and up over my chest. She moved around and took my cock in her hand.</p> <p>She started to move her soapy hands back up along side her. She looked up at me and asked in a veryâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
