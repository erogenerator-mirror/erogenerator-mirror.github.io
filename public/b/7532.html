You are going be the same person you are today but you can also forget what you are going to be."</p> <p>"It is true that I can't say this in private, but I will just find a way."</p> <p>I looked at her, a look of worry written all over my face. She gently pushed me away from her, and walked me down the hall to the bedroom. She stood at the doorway, taking a few steps closer as she said, "Kneel down again."</p> <p>My knees became weak as I did so. I dropped to my knees and bent my head, pressing my cheek to her thighs as I took one of her thighs in mine. I could feel the warmth come from her softness and I pressed up to her. She held my head in place, and her hands went to my hair, pulling it so she could have it all.</p> <p></p> <p>"I can tell you're ready to go now, and if you want us to stop, you have to ask. You know I will hold you close at the ends of your time."</p> <p>I felt her hand come to rest between my shoulder blades. I had a smile on my face and a sense of peace and love.</p> <p></p> <p>"Please." I said out the word; "Yes."</p> <p>I turned my head and looked back at her, a look of confusion and sadness on my face. She looked at me with a smile so intense it made my knees weak, and it was with her own smile that she told me to let it all go. It had been years since I had done that, and if I hadn't gone through it already, it would never have happened. She didn't have to do all this to tell me how to live or what to wear or not to wear, I had nothing to be ashamed of. I didn't want her to think I was a bad influence on her, even when I was around.</p> <p>She gently pulled me into a hard hug. I could feel her breasts pressed against my back, and the softness of her skin so warm and soft, with her arms holding me. It would have been so much easier if she had tried to push me away from her so softly but I had no intention of losing control of myself. But I had to say yes. Her hand went to my cheek and I leaned into her. She kissed me softly and lovingly on the lips, as if to say, "I've never had a man's hands there before." She whispered, and as she did, I felt her fingers in my hair, tugging slightly. I was shocked, and kissed her again, but my lips remained in place. I felt it for a time; not the sexual intensity, but the feeling of her lips, and just the way I had been able to feel her lips for so long.</p> <p>"You're right, I had a lot to talk to you about." I said, looking up into her eyes.</p> <p></p> <p>She smiled a smile that was so wonderful, "I'm glad you're not angry with me because it's a good thing that you are. Just because I said yes. I know he can't stay around in his room and fuck you all day long. I'm sure he still hasn't been able to. Just like the way you say yes, that's okay because it feels good to me too."</p> <p>I hugged her again, and pulled her down closer to me. "Don't worry about all that." I said. "We'll get through this together."</p> <p></p> <p>When I came out of the bathroom, she was already dressed, sitting on the bed beside me. She grabbed the cuffs of her skirt so she could get them off. She had one leg up on the bed and was slowly pushing her skirt off her hips, and a big smile on her face as she saw the effect she had on me. She had such an affect on me like that. She pulled her skirt back up and took my hand in hers and placed it on her bare thigh. I felt my legs buckle a little as I slipped my hand underneath her skirt and felt the fabric of her panties. She was as smooth as a baby.</p> <p>****************</p> <p>I watched as she stood up and held me in her arms. If I didn't know any better I'd think she had a boyfriend. We just stood there like that for some long time. She put her arms around my neck and pulled me back to her. We kissed gently, and I could feel her softness, and the scent of her perfume on my lips. I felt her hand start to rub my cock through my pants where her fingers had been while we were French kissing. My hands went to her ass, and thenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
