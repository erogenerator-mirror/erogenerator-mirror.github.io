My throat was dry. What had happened? I did not feel like I had just witnessed a disaster.</p> <p>As she drew closer to me I could feel my body shaking. She leaned over my shoulder and whispered...</p> <p>"Relax." My body relaxed and my head fell back into the sofa cushion.</p> <p>I felt her face brush my hair away from my face. She gently wiped my neck, then slid her fingers up my arms and around to my shoulders. She rubbed my arms in silence, and I tried to relax myself into the sofa. When she finished with my arms I felt her take my wrists and pull them behind my back, while putting her hands on my shoulders. She looked into my eyes and slowly slid them down to my neck making me shiver again. I could just make out her dark brown eyes with a touch of compassion. She started moving down my upper chest with a little more ease. She leaned in and kissed me on the lips, gently biting them gently. I opened my mouth and she slipped her tongue inside my lips, her eyes staring into my own. I instinctively slid them into her mouth and my tongue met hers. Her tongue slowly massaged mine, as she slowly slid it in and out of my mouth. I could feel myself growing hard again.</p> <p>She continued sliding her tongue down to my collarbone and back, licking the skin between my collar bones, then lightly biting my soft skin. I felt her tongue slide down my throat, her finger slide down the soft skin of my chest. Her fingers stroked my nipples under my shirt, her finger nails stroking me gently as they lightly crossed my stomach. She moved down to my stomach taking my skirt and shoes off as she slid down to my toes. She ran her hands up and down my long muscular legs, as she moved her hands up and down, then back up. The pleasure from her touch ran through me like lightning.</p> <p>She slowly slid down my right leg and gently ran her fingers down my bare thigh. She slid her fingers along the bottom of my foot, then around and across my knee, all the way to my ankle. She slid her hands back down to my ankle and slowly slid my shoe off. I leaned forward, allowing her access to slide around again. Her hand reached up and cupped my foot, which made it slide up her leg. I felt her warm breath on my skin and felt her tongue run across the back of it. I turned to the side and closed my eyes. She slowly slid my other foot out, making me arch my ass up. She smiled and gently kissed the back side of my bare foot.</p> <p>I could feel the desire in her eyes, and I felt as if she wanted to devour me. She slowly slid up my leg kissing and teasing my inner thigh, while her hands were slowly stroking my body. When she reached the bottom of my thigh she stopped and just layed on top of me. I felt her body on top of mine for the first time and my hands ran down her back. She rubbed my shoulders and then slid her hands in my hair, pulling as much of it out of the silky curls. The feeling was electric. My heart started racing. Did she just feel my heart pounding out of control, or was she just really enjoying herself, or was this just the most intimate and sensual thing in her life, or maybe did all this anticipation just get to me? Was she making me feel like a virgin, no longer virgin; just a naughty little girl, just made to be a girl; a dirty slut; a sex object for her?</p> <p>Oh no. I was not a young child. She was a grown woman. She had experience and I felt that I was her first.</p> <p>I felt her slide her tongue down my body. She had to taste me. I could not tell whether it was an accident that she reached my panties, but she gently placed her tongue inside the silk. I heard myself making a quiet sigh of pleasure; as if I were doing the same thing to her. It was incredible. Her tongue slid down from my nipples towards my slit, licking it, then up again, then back down to the top. When she slid her tongue over my clit I screamed, grabbing her head and pushing her away so I could hold her tightly. She stopped moving and slid another finger inside. I felt her fingers rubbing my clit, then pressing deep between my legs.</p> <p>She slid her fingers slowly out of me, making me gasp. She quickly slid her fingers back in, and started the finger slowly in and out of me with a slow and steady pace. I was feeling like I would die of pleasure, so soft, so wet, so alive. My pussy was so slick it literally dripped. Each breath made me whimper.</p> <p>"Oh god Baby, you taste so good." She slid onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
