"That all you want to do is make it with me. Is that it?"</p> <p>Amber felt like she had no control over whether this was going to be the right thing to do, but despite her fear she found that her body was responding in ways that only a female would react to. "Oh God," Amber said in an exasperated tone. "What am I going to do? I've just been so nervous about it ever since I saw you."</p> <p>"Don't be," John said firmly. "It will be fine. But why don't you try to remember it? You feel like you've never before experienced any pleasure like that, have you?"</p> <p>Amber nodded in answer to his pleasurable prodding.</p> <p>"Good," he replied. "Now let's see if I can find a way to bring you to where you need it. You are one of my biggest fans."</p> <p>"So you want me to write about how wonderful you are," Amber muttered. "What's going on with you? What does it look like I'm doing?"</p> <p>John was pleased to hear her, too.</p> <p>"We are already planning on seeing my last video with you," he said. "I'm happy to have a new friend who loves the same things you do."</p> <p>Amber was in a daze now. Her body was in conflict with her will, and she wanted nothing more than to just let herself go, but her desire for John was too strong. "How can I refuse him if I'm already his favourite fan?" she thought.</p> <p>She tried to think of something else, but all she could come up with was something like a silly little dare, and now that her body was acting up she decided that she would take the challenge to "go with it."</p> <p>John smiled encouragingly at her. "You do have a great body, Amber. Now come on let's get started."</p> <p>"No no no no," Amber protested. "Please! Give me your cock!"</p> <p>"There are other ways of doing that!" John said. "Just lay back down on the bed. The chair in the corner won't give us much room. Go ahead and straddle it."</p> <p>Amber hesitated a little, but then sat on the edge of the bed as instructed. "Don't put it in me, please!"</p> <p>John grinned at her, pleased that she had done this. He began to get undressed again.</p> <p>"I guess you won't be wearing panties," John teased.</p> <p>"I'll never be allowed to wear panties again!" Amber protested. "That feels so nice."</p> <p>"Then it's going to feel even nicer getting that way," John replied.</p> <p>Amber didn't argue with him. Instead, she reached beneath her naked body and began to caress her own breasts. The touch of her lover's hands on her body felt so good, and the fact that John was watching her caused her pussy to ache with desire. The sight of her stroking her own breasts added to her arousal in a way that wasn't easy to explain.</p> <p>John was impressed that Amber's body reacted the way she did whenever she saw him looking at her, and also pleased that her body showed it. Her breasts were large but firm, her waist narrow by being so thin. Her waist was rounded and her thighs were firm. She had a full round back, but her ass was large and firm compared to her thin waist. She had a small, round face, with a soft, round chin. Her eyes had a wide, open, innocent look about them that didn't make it hard for her to make eye contact, but John couldn't tell if she was staring straight ahead or not. However, the way her eyes had remained open, and then closing slowly when her gaze was fixed upon him, seemed to say anything.</p> <p>"Take your panties off," John continued. "I want to see you."</p> <p>"No!" Amber protested. "Please!"</p> <p>"There is something else I want to do," John said. "This is going to be about what you want. Now get those tight jeans off and let's see what happens when you take them off."</p> <p>"No!" Amber said. "Put your hands away!"</p> <p>"That's not possible," John reminded her. "Why don't you just do as I say."</p> <p>"I can't," Amber said. "My hands are too tight."</p> <p>"I want that!" John said. "Now just remove your shirt."</p> <p>There was a moment's hesitation for Amber to object before she finally relented. She tossed the shirt off the chair and then began to work her buttons as John watched. The whole time, despite her protestations, Amber's hand held the hem of her shirt in the manner most ladies in distress could do. Eventually, her fingers came to a halt and her shirt was completely removed revealing her body to Johnâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
