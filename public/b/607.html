A voice from behind them pulled them from where they'd been lying at their feet. "It's time you joined the mile-high club."</p> <p>"What is it?"</p> <p>"Come on honey, we've been going around in circles asking for you to find yourself."</p> <p>Jenny and Lisa's eyes moved to the man at the edge of the tent then to each other. She saw him smile then she smiled back.</p> <p>"I have, the first weekend of my life," She admitted, "I had it all mapped out so I would love for you all to come. What do you say?"</p> <p>"I say I'll be there honey but you can't do that."</p> <p>"So I can come with you." Lisa grinned, "Come on honey, its no fun if we can't help ourselves."</p> <p>"I can help you," Jenny said, "we've all been looking forward to all of this for months."</p> <p>"And I'll be there."</p> <p>He reached out and pulled her against his body, his arm snaking around her body to hug her tightly. Jenny laughed and squeezed him to her, "Come on, go ahead, it'll be fun."</p> <p>"It definitely won't be," Lisa said, pushing past him as they got up. "The last thing you'll ever hear of me is 'Come on honey, take me upstairs and I'll show you, let me show you, make love to me, I know I couldn't have done it anyway. Then you'll never get to know me until we're married..."</p> <p>Jenny shook her head laughing.</p> <p>"Come on, we have to tell you what is and isn't funny."</p> <p>They both walked up the trail and took Lisa's hand they followed her upstairs, up to the bedroom, where they kissed her deeply while they stripped each other.</p> <p>"Now," Lisa whispered, "are we going to do it?"</p> <p>They'd left the bedroom door open at first as there was no other thought of it when they'd stripped off each others clothes. Once they were completely naked Jenny had already stripped Lisa by the hair, but now her friend lay underneath her, kissing her deeply while her hand found the base of Lisa's cock through her pants.</p> <p>She started slowly and Lisa was soon matching her efforts, her lips pressing against the top of each of her friend's thighs, teasingly working her way up the other's legs. Lisa's tongue slid lightly into Jenny's mouth and their mutual moans mingled around each other, and it was then that their lips met. Their mouths closed together and they kissed passionately as their mutual bodies pressed together, the feel of the other's skin against theirs mingling and combining and blending, their hands caressing each other while their tongues worked each other's mouths. Their hands found each other's breasts and the other's hands found their breasts. Lisa's hand found the base of Jenny's cock and she rubbed her fingers up and down the head. Jenny was moaning and groaning, enjoying the pressure, feeling the weight of her friend against her, feeling the hard length of it against her. It was then that Jenny felt it. Her hands squeezed Lisa's butt and she slid the hard meat back to her own body. It moved in her and then Jenny's thumb found the spot between Lisa's balls and her rectum. Her tongue darted out to tease the tip of Lisa's cock, making it wet and she gently pulled, the head was sliding in between her lips. She pressed her hips against Lisa's hand, trying to feel the hard cock between her ass cheeks. She could feel Lisa's cock sliding between hers and the other's fingers pressed against the base of her cock and her fingers. They rubbed against each other and then came together, a kiss of pleasure, of lust.</p> <p>"Wow," Jenny said, leaning up to kiss Lisa's lips again. "That had me in like an hour."</p> <p>"Me too," Lisa added as they lay next to each other kissing and caressing. "Now we've got to find out what's happening in here."</p> <p>"What is?"</p> <p>"I can't, no, I can't..."</p> <p>"Why not?"</p> <p>"You don't think we might find it funny?" Lisa grinned at her. "No, no, really, its not that funny."</p> <p>"But we can't just look on?"</p> <p>"Sure we can. I can look on, can't I, what if you feel uncomfortable? We won't be seeing each other, surely."</p> <p>"Well that is what we will see of each other, isn't it?" Jenny laughed, "No, no, of course not we won't, we can't. Not as far as I can tell, at least not quite like thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
