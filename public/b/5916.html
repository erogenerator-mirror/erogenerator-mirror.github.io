Of course, I had made my move after all. I was going to be going in there just to get some food, drink beer, and go to the gym in just underwear. But being an average looking college girl, I figured I could get away with it without too much trouble if I was successful in finding someone.</p> <p>"Come on," I said to myself as I looked around for a bathroom and some towels. "Let's go somewhere more private. I'll change and join the game. I've got a few minutes to kill in there." I had the gym all figured out in record time. I was going to get some hot water or something on my hands before I entered the showers. Since I had my panties on, I thought I could easily slip the panties off under the skirt I was wearing.</p> <p>There was a nice sized bathroom attached to the main building and a couple of benches to walk down to. I was right on time and I went into the showers.</p> <p>The first thing I looked at were the shower benches. Since this was the second largest bathroom in the facility, I was going to fill the gaps between them. And since they all had to be near the showers, it was easy to go back to the first bench. So I stood there and watched the showers continue to run for a few minutes before I remembered what I was going to do. Before I could take off my shoes, I said my goodbyes to the locker room manager and let myself into the shower area.</p> <p>As I turned on some water, I thought to myself; I might as well just forget about doing it and just jump in, and forget all of that I had to do in school. I took the soap and started soaping up my body. I took my time soaping up, as if I was doing a good job of doing it with soap. The shower doors opened with one click to let in the warm air into the locker room. That would give me enough room to turn the corner and get out of the shower as I was toweling off my breasts and crotch. I stood there admiring myself in the mirror.</p> <p>I didn't have to wait long. I was stepping up into the shower with a couple of friends. We started grabbing shower gear and cleaning each other up. They were taking turns soaping each other up.</p> <p>"Hey, can you help me out here with this top?" asked one of the guys.</p> <p>"Sure," I said.</p> <p>We were both naked, standing under the shower stall. I held onto the top and began lathering my breasts with plenty of soap suds as we were all rubbing ourselves against each other.</p> <p>"You guys are probably tired, too," he said, taking his turn. "I'd be willing to give you some privacy, but I'll be done in a moment." He leaned in and said something to the guys, who just stepped out of their way.</p> <p>"Sure," I said.</p> <p>"Alright then. I'll join you guys in a bit," said the hot guy as he leaned in and began to mop up my crotch. I let him go at it for a couple of minutes, then reached over and began rubbing his crotch too.</p> <p>"Oh, that feels good," I said. "I was trying not to be too loud. I'm kind of sensitive here." After I thanked him for the soap, I began rubbing the soap up and down my breasts and stomach before getting my legs all lathered up. "What about me?" I asked.</p> <p>"It doesn't bother you?" said one of the guys.</p> <p>"Ugh, I don't have a choice. It was hot." I told him.</p> <p>He seemed to like the idea too. "Yeah, maybe it would be better if we weren't out in public." He added.</p> <p>I started to get a little impatient. "Okay. I'll just go stand in the corner for a minute until we're ready. I could use that after seeing you guys working on each other. But I'm a professional. My job is to take care of a person's feelings. That's not going to get to you in a hurry."</p> <p>My own desires were quickly being replaced by the idea of getting a shower. I had just started getting excited by the thought of a hot guy touching me. Not being a prude or anything, I'd been thinking about guys in the shower before. That was a big turn-on to me.</p> <p>I wanted to give one of the guys a good back rub on that front and also get the guys hard without my pussy to help the effect. I really wanted to give him a massage. But the thought of him doing me in return made me a little nervous.</p> <p>I knew it was important to him toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
