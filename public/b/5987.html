Kate got the door quickly, and opened it to find her brother standing on the other side of the threshold with what must've been his suit in his hands.</p> <p>"Hello, baby, how was your day?"</p> <p>"It was great," she said as she opened the door wider to allow him into her home.</p> <p>"I could tell that was hard," he replied, smiling at her and walking in her living room into the sitting room where he had left her.</p> <p>As soon as she saw him she felt both elated and flattered. "Wow. You look great," she said as she took in the rest of the man sitting on the couch on the couch. His suit was a gray color and the skirt appeared to be about 10-12 inches and the top was a blue plaid suit with large yellow stars on it. He was standing at 6-5, weighed about 250, with brown hair down to his waist, deep blue eyes that matched his shirt.</p> <p>Kate was surprised to see a smile on his face. "Hey," he said, and then, "Why don't you go ahead and sit down and relax."</p> <p>Kate got up and crossed the room. "Honey, what are you doing?"</p> <p>"Oh, I'm just looking for a place to relax a bit," he said, then stood up at her side and walked her over to his couch and seated her on it. "See, this is an improvement over my old bed."</p> <p>Kate laughed at his silly joke. "Hey, come on. We're adults here, remember?"</p> <p>As he sat down, he slid his chair under Kate's chair, where it gave her nice access to his lap. He was in full view of the front of the couch since the back of his suit was draped over him.</p> <p>He leaned toward Kate at the end of the couch and kissed her lightly on the mouth, then he ran his hand up the back of her thigh. He leaned his forehead against hers as he kissed her again.</p> <p>"You know, I really like what you're wearing," he said.</p> <p>Kate put an arm over his shoulder and kissed him on the lips. "I feel just the same way," she said as she moved her other arm around his neck, caressing his hair gently.</p> <p>Bianca slid a hand down behind him and ran her fingers along his forearm, slowly along the back of it as she felt the warmth on her hand. Her fingertips lingered on his forearm while he ran his hand up her thigh and under her skirt.</p> <p>"Mmmm...."</p> <p>He began working her shirt up and down his arm while kissing her lips, neck neck, and ears, running his tongue softly against hers as he began caressing her left breast through her blouse.</p> <p>Her breath hissed from between her lips as he slowly unbuttoned her blouse and reached the lower reaches of the top of her breasts, rubbing his palms against the hardening points of her nipples. He kissed on her as her shirt fell down and was pleased to see he still had her bra on.</p> <p>Bianca turned his shirt up toward the middle so she could undo the snaps on it and began moving her arms from the top of his shoulders back up.</p> <p>As she slowly pulled his shirt up and kissed his upper chest, her hand slid inside to cup his manhood, and begin stroking it as her tongue caressed his chin and his lips.</p> <p>She was aware of every subtle move a woman's hands make when they are working someone's body, and if what he was doing to her wasn't anything she really wanted to look into, it sure didn't feel like rubbing herself to orgasm each so that it could last longer.</p> <p>She pulled his shirt out from his pants, kissed his nipples, then licked them, taking a chance on tasting himself, and then flicking them with her tongue again. He ran his fingers through her hair as she sucked on him.</p> <p>"Mmmmm...."</p> <p>They were both breathing a bit faster. Bently, Bibi grabbed her brother's shirt to pull it off, and then slid his pants off as he sat on the edge of his chair naked and she still in her shirt.</p> <p>Bibi leaned forward and undid her bra, then pulled her shorts off, her full breasts hanging free. He was on his knees as he licked and sucked on her, working in a pattern with his hands over her breasts and he rubbed her body from head to toe.</p> <p>This was the first time a woman had ever let him touch her like that and Kate felt herself squirming. She had never met a man like her when she was on all fours, a woman riding her man with her tongue in his mouth on each stroke.
