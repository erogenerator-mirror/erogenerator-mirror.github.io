He had a smug grin on his face; I could tell from his tone that he really cared more than just being caught. I nodded to him. So he knows I am watching? I wasn't so sure.</p> <p>"You want to do that tonight?" I asked. He shook his head, still gazing out of the window. It's not like that. He knows we'll fuck. That's his thing.</p> <p>"Do you? That's what's going on with me, and with Matt."</p> <p>I felt my nipples hardening, and I realized I was rubbing my pussy through my thin negligee.</p> <p>"What is it?" He asked.</p> <p>"It's not just the sex with Matt, or the anticipation of it that makes me wet."</p> <p>My little fantasy, what will I do? Will I like this? Will I do this?</p> <p>"Go to Matt." He smiled at me.</p> <p>I shook out of my robe. There's a shower I have, and a nice view. I couldn't have done this much without the guys, so I stood in the bedroom. They are there. I felt a bit awkward as my body moved out of the room. They were all there, talking about Matt and the shower, about me and what the two of them are up to, and about that big guy. I saw that Matt's back to me. I could see his taut taut butt pressed up against the glass, the thin fabric of his swim trunks clinging to his body like it's being held up by a belt.</p> <p>I felt a tingle in my pussy. They know. We've done everything else. Now, no fucking.</p> <p>I looked back at my robe. It's falling off now, and I think I can still hear the two guys talking about me. This is wrong. This is wrong. This is wrong. I didn't care that much. I didn't care that much about the sex of their conversation. I didn't care, and the two guys had to know something we didn't think.</p> <p>I slipped the robe off. Then I stood there in front of them in my sexiest state. The two guys were looking back at me, like I was no longer there. I didn't look at them. I don't think that I had a thing to cover up with my eyes. They got a big surprise when Matt got out of the shower, and they did a striptease for me.</p> <p>"I hope you are feeling better now," I said, turning and sliding my fingers over my tummy.</p> <p>My fingers moved down to my pussy, where the bikini bottom was still pulled down to one side. I pushed two fingers into it, then ran a finger back down to my pussy. The one other finger went in to her panties.</p> <p>"What's on your stomach?" I asked.</p> <p>"Nothing," said my husband. "Just your eyes. The guys are on you." He reached out and pulled me closer to him. I stood there, feeling his erection pressing against my body. It felt good. I took one of his hands, and he put the other on my leg. His fingers were very cold, and it was a good sensation. They moved higher and higher until they were rubbing my panties. He rubbed my pussy. My pussy.</p> <p>"We said no sex," I said, a bit loud.</p> <p>"We know," his finger stopped on my panties where my pussy lips were. "We asked you to be with us, not watch." He put his hand on my knee, and ran his fingers up to my panties. "We both know where this is going." He pulled my panties off.</p> <p>"Yes, we know," I said. "But we've only done this once before." I stood there not looking at Matt, but at the two of them. "We should be doing it with the real guys." I said, pointing toward the door.</p> <p>The two guys looked at me, who was still trying to figure anything out. "It's a big decision," he said. "I'm sure neither of us will make it." He looked at my husband. "Do you want to watch?" he asked. The two guys looked at each other. They both shook their heads. I looked back at him, but it was all so far away from the action from the shower, but watching me through the glass, even in my aroused state. I could see his cock moving inside his shorts. It had to be huge! I had no idea how I could put both of them here, naked, with me and not them.</p> <p>Matt leaned back against the bed as he lay down. I straddled his legs, my pussyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
