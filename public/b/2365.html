It was a good job that she was not wearing socks, as she needed to wind up damp during the next two months in order to save her skirt. I was going to be there for the duration.</p> <p>I finished my beer and headed for the van again to begin my search. She would be back in a few more hours and she would have to call me in to get changed and ready.</p> <p>After nearly a minute, I started to feel my dick starting to stir. A car had pulled into her drive.</p> <p>"Are you in a hurry to do something?" I called out, coming to a stop as she looked around a little confused. She had never been in a city vehicle before and she was looking around like she was about to check this out for herself. She didn't respond. She just pulled her car around the side of her office building.</p> <p>The van stopped a little way back from the building, and she followed right out the door and onto the street.</p> <p>"Here. Don't worry. Take a good long look. There's nothing really to show for it, but I'm not looking to run it now. Besides, as soon as I get out of doors, I'll have your skirt off and my cock hard for you."</p> <p>"Ok, I'm ready. Take your coat off and your shoes off. I want to watch and feel. If you're uncomfortable, you can pull your things on and just let them slide to the floor."</p> <p>She was standing right alongside me and I stepped in front. I could feel the warmth and the warmth of her body. It was easy to see she was wet as she turned her eyes down a little to try to look into my eyes. I grabbed a pair of black high-heeled sandals from her work desk and began to rub them across her feet. She didn't respond at all. She started to relax as I put them on.</p> <p>I felt the softness of her feet. It was good as I was almost done with them. My hands rubbed across her bare soles and around her ankles. I could see the muscles of her ankles and calves flexing as I worked her higher and higher.</p> <p>My hands moved higher and up her calves, up the inside of her thighs. Up higher to her knees and then under her skirt until I could feel the bare skin of her ass cheeks. She kept her legs closed tightly. My hands slid up her sides and under her skirt. She spread her legs, even tighter. Her feet shifted under my hands a little.</p> <p>"No!" she gasped "Please don't touch me there. I don't know what to do."</p> <p>I moved up to cover her pussy lips and she looked at me with a worried expression on her face. She looked out of the window again at the rain falling from the sky to her bare feet on the ground. I slipped my fingers under her panties and felt the wet fabric against my palm. I slid my hand back down over her pussy mound and felt the wetness. I could feel it running down my shaft. I wanted to slide down my pants. I wanted to slide my fingers between those legs and lick her to orgasm.</p> <p>"Please, Sir...please, don't touch me there. Take it off... please, take it off."</p> <p>I couldn't help myself. I leaned down so that I could feel the wet spots of her moisture on my palm. I wanted to lick them. I wanted to have my tongue in her wet pussy lips. I reached around and felt her breasts with my hands and began to lift them up and out so that they were fully exposed to me.</p> <p>"No. No. You have to take it off. You have to take off your panties. It'll be much better if you don't, I promise we won't try to stop this as we do it, ok?"</p> <p>She was so scared that I couldn't believe what was happening. Her voice was quivering.</p> <p>"No. No, no, I can't. I can't. Take off my panties, it's forbidden."</p> <p>When I hesitated, she took my hands in hers and pulled them off. My cock was now as hard as a rock in my pants. She could feel it through the fabric of my pants.</p> <p>She was shaking all over. She was frightened. She wanted to see it but it was not going to happen.</p> <p>I stood up and stepped back from her. I reached up and took her hands and pulled her behind me. She looked back at me and then looked back quickly at my cock. It was standing like a flagpole. "Not there, not there...please, it can wait...please let me..."</p> <p>Herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
