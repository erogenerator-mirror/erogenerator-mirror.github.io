This time, when she spoke, her voice cracked.</p> <p>"Oh, sorry, Ms. Walker."</p> <p>"It's fine. I'm only nervous," she said.</p> <p>When she saw me start to walk towards the door, she said,</p> <p>"I don't think so. I am nervous, and I don't want you to look at me like that." She took my hand, turned around, and looked me dead in the eye.</p> <p>"I understand," she said softly. "I want you to go through with it. And you'll be amazed. Just do it." With that, she stepped back and dropped the hood of her dress. It was a soft but professional looking material, all lace. She had worn it the last time I'd seen it. I did exactly as she asked. I was surprised at the lack of fabric that held the skirt together.</p> <p>She took me by the hand as I slowly walked to her and stood next to the table. She put her fingers on the collar and pulled it apart. Then, the zipper came down and fell down almost to her waist.</p> <p>"We're going to have to get undressed," she said in a whisper. I nodded and helped her pull off her sweater. I was a little taken back by some of the lingerie on her; she was a girl wearing a corset, and even without the make-up, and in my opinion, it was a little slutty and sex-charged. I reached out to pull the corset back, and she stopped me.</p> <p>"Wait," she said, and took my hand again. "I want to look good for you. I want to do this a whole lot. You're all mine, and I want to please you, too. Let's do it, then."</p> <p>She took my hand again, led me to her bedroom and sat me on the bed. She unzipped the skirt, pulled it off, and dropped it on the floor. She stood and removed her stockings. Her skin was almost identical to her bra. She turned around and showed me her panty line, and she wasn't wearing any panties.</p> <p>"Now that it looks okay," she said, "I don't know if I want to do anything right now." I nodded and started undoing the buttons of my shirt as she watched. I reached behind her and slowly unclasped her bra so that her chest was bare. It went down the first button, and she took the shirt off. She unhooked the bra and let it drop on the floor. I dropped my shorts followed by my boxers in a pool of fabric, revealing my cock. She started touching herself, and then we were both naked.</p> <p>"Well, that doesn't go to waste," she said, "I've already seen you naked, and I want to get to know you better." With that, she stepped toward me and pushed me on the bed, and then stood back to look me up and down. I'd been looking at her ass, which had to be five inches in height. From where I was, I could see her smooth taut belly-bone, her narrow waist, and the soft slopes of her breasts. She ran her hands over my chest, which was well over six-inches long, and then kneaded my pecs.</p> <p>"That's great," she said. "I like the way it bounces when you lift it." She rubbed her hands over and around my nipples.</p> <p>"You like what you see?" I asked, taking my hands away from hers. She smiled to let me know she liked my response to my question. My cock was hard as a rock, and she leaned over to kiss and lick it, and then looked up at me and said,</p> <p>"You're an impressive specimen. That's more than enough." With that, she rolled over on her back and opened her legs so that I could see her pussy. The lips of her cunt were swollen from my sucking and stroking them.</p> <p>"It's not so bad," she said, looking up at me,</p> <p>"Does your pussy taste good?"</p> <p>"Yes, you did say you liked how it tasted good, but I think I'll get to experience it." She smiled up at me and beckoned me to lie down with her. As I did so, she took the head of my cock in her mouth for the first time ever. I watched as her lips wrapped tightly around my shaft, the tip of her tongue making long swirls as she sucked me harder and harder.</p> <p>She stopped sucking and looked up at me. "Are you ready to start cumming?"</p> <p>"Oh yeah, baby. I'm going to pump a hot load of cum in you.
