"We had a relationship long before you were ever born."</p> <p>"I love you, sweetheart," I said.</p> <p>"And I love you," she answered, again smiling, this time with her eyes closed and her smile growing, turning to look at me and I felt like I was in the presence of a whole world. "I think that I've said the wrong thing, my son. God, I love you," she said, finally. "You're really beautiful."</p> <p>I was about to get up and kiss her, this would save it. "You're not a little girl anymore," I said, looking her in the eye. "I'm a man. You are one of my people."</p> <p>She looked me in the eyes. "I've had it with you," she said, in a voice that I had never heard before. I saw the sparkle of my daughter in my mind and I knew what I had to do, so I moved up beside her. A few seconds passed as we laid there together, both thinking about each other and I realized that she was talking to me from the look on her face. She put her arm around me and I turned our bodies so that we faced each other. Her beautiful body was inches from mine and I could feel her kiss come more deeply. It was wonderful and I put my arm around her and we kissed again. We held each other for what seemed like hours, both of us holding the other close.</p> <p>"I am going to love you," I said.</p> <p>"But now," she said. "Now we can start enjoying each other again."</p> <p>I was looking at her, seeing her face, seeing how her lips were close to mine. I moved a bit then, letting my lips meet hers, moving from there. We kissed again, like those we had had a year ago. It was so much more, sensual. It was pure sex, the sexual excitement and passion of the next two days was intense and intense. It left no doubt. This time, we would be together, together, living life, having great sex and enjoying each other. I held that face tightly against my own, feeling her breath on my mouth as I kissed her deeply, as though I would never let her go.</p> <p>That is, until we broke the kiss, I mean, as lovers, and saw that it was the look in her eye that brought it on. She moved her head and kissed me again. "I'm sorry about the hair," she said. "I can't believe I got it all messed up."</p> <p>"You're beautiful," I said and she looked at me smiling. "Your hair has always been a turn on for me and I'll never forget it."</p> <p>"Thank you," she said and I felt her hand slide down lower, between my legs. She rubbed my pussy as my eyes closed. "You're so wet," she said, looking me in the eyes and moving a finger up to my nipple. She pulled it lightly and I could feel the tingling in my stomach.</p> <p>"Oh, you're so gorgeous," I said. "I'm sorry. I forgot how exciting it is to have another woman masturbate for me." I turned my body so that it was facing her. I knew she could see my lips, which were swollen, as my fingers were moving around and between each lip, pressing into them.</p> <p>She kissed me for a while. "It's been a while," she said. "Are you OK about me eating your pussy?"</p> <p>"Uh huh," I said.</p> <p>I felt her tongue run up the left side of my lips and I could feel my nipple between my fingers as she licked my lips ever so lightly, but then I saw that her finger was rubbing gently along my pussy lips and she lifted her head. She looked at me, smiling as she took her finger away from my lips and pushed her middle finger into the wetness of my pussy. "Umm," I said as my head went back. "Yesss."</p> <p>"Your pussy is so wet," she said.</p> <p>"I love your finger in there," I said. "I can feel it running from the top of my pussy right up to my clit."</p> <p>"My husband never made me clean up all his fingers," she said. "He always left me some Kleenex in my purse."</p> <p>"I can tell," I said. "Your panties are wet too."</p> <p>I could feel her finger gently moving in and out of me as she leaned close to me, running her fingers across my clit as a finger would slide over it.</p> <p>"It excites you, doesnâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
