I don't mean that."</p> <p>"It's fine, I just want to know what it is you want so badly."</p> <p>"Oh yeah."</p> <p>His hand went to her thigh again this time he pulled her legs apart just enough for him to stroke along the inside of her thigh.</p> <p>"Umm...is this the way it's supposed to go?"</p> <p>"Yuh...yeah that's it."</p> <p>He felt her move then he could feel her hands go to the back of his head and he looked up to see her biting her lip and smiling.</p> <p>"What's that?" He asked.</p> <p>"I want you to make love to me. Now."</p> <p>"I don't know if..."</p> <p>"No, I know you are tired, so why don't you get up?" She gave him a quick kiss on the lips and then he got up. He walked to the bed and she got up and followed behind him. He lay face down on the bed and she got up over him.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" He heard her ask.</p> <p>"Ready for what?"</p> <p>"To do anything that is going to make us both very happy."</p> <p>"Oh yeah sure."</p> <p>She kissed him and started to rub her breasts over his body. He reached and put his hands on her breasts as she rubbed himself.</p> <p>"So, what do we do next?"</p> <p>"Oh I still don't know. How about this?"</p> <p>"Yeah that would be great."</p> <p>He felt her press her body next to him and then he felt the head of his cock coming to rest against her thigh. She pulled away from his lips and leaned over him to kiss him and he felt her lips run through his hair as she kissed him. She put her tongue in his mouth and tasted it.</p> <p>"Mmm, that is nice. It is a surprise then."</p> <p>"You have a way."</p> <p>"I guess."</p> <p>He felt her slide off him before he felt her kiss him again. They kissed for a while and then she started to kiss and bite his chest and then kissed his neck. He felt her hands sliding lower between them down towards her own crotch.</p> <p>"Oh no."</p> <p>"I said no." When he felt what she was doing he pulled her in closer to him.</p> <p>"Mmm...you're not going to use your hands to pleasure me are you?" Her hands came up and squeezed his ass and as they came to rest on his ass and his legs he felt her press herself against his hard cock.</p> <p>"No, I'm not."</p> <p>"Then don't be. We just had to have each other, I wasn't sure if I could stop it from happening now."</p> <p>She stopped kissing his neck leaving his. He felt her get up from him. He lay there as she went back to him kissing and rubbing her body against his as she lay down. She leaned on top of him and then said something he could not say or hear.</p> <p>"Do you think I'm ready?"</p> <p>"Not quite, there's still time for all of you."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"No. I'm ready. But I can find something we both want now."</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>She leaned in and gave him another kiss and then she pushed down on his chest and he felt her climb on top of him and her hands go to the back of his head and then she kissed him and kissed his chest. She moved down and kissed and licked his stomach as she went lower. She stopped to kiss his thighs and then began working her way back up again. As her lips went down he felt his own breath coming in quick bursts of gasps. He had his hands on his cock and it started as a prelude to her licking he just couldn't hold out any longer.</p> <p>"Oh yeah..."</p> <p>He felt her take a long breath in just as he came. He could feel her body as it contracted and shook. As he heard her breathing slowing she opened her eyes and looked at him. He saw sweat glisten on her face.</p> <p>"I really need a shower."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"I'm sure."</p> <p>"OK, but no more." He held his hand out to him.</p> <p>"I'm still going to have to find someplace this weekend. I'm still getting used to having another woman. I don't think there's a thing at home I enjoy more."</p> <p>"I can't blame you for trying!" She leaned down to kiss himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
