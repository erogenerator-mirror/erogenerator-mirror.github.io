I'm married and they won't take anything from you, what are you thinking"</p> <p>"I just want you. I've thought about it all the time since you came. Just like you just wanted me. Is that why you're still doing it, because you're still married?"</p> <p>"It is, but it's not about that, even with what you've done. I'm willing to forgive her some of it if that helps."</p> <p>She got up and walked over to him. He stood still as she wrapped her right arm around his neck and gently kissed him on the lips. She leaned in and gave him a soft peck. His hands went to her waist and pulled her hips against him. They broke the kiss and she rubbed her hand up his chest to his jawline and slowly pushed her face into his. She whispered how much she loved him and wanted it again. She then leaned in for another light peck on the lips and then began to pull away. He placed his hand behind her neck and lifted her off the ground.</p> <p>"You're getting married soon."</p> <p>Jemma laughed and stood upright, her body glistening with sweat, looking up at him with lust. She was still in her clothes and her hair still down, but the man was still naked from the waist up. "I hope so."</p> <p>"If it were you, I would do everything I can."</p> <p>"I think that you're going to enjoy this."</p> <p>The man lifted her over his shoulder and turned her towards the large, oak door. He pushed with his body and she landed smoothly into the back of the truck. He then helped her from the truck and they walked off around a small bank of trees. They entered the woods by the pool and he set her down across his lap. He bent down while she laid face down upon the rock near the pool, a large tree a few feet from the edge. Jemma got her legs under her and lifted herself up. The man took her hands and gently placed them on his cock.</p> <p>"You know I've always wanted to do this. I didn't want to do something like this."</p> <p>"I knew you would. The last time we did this I was really sore from pounding you in the ass. I haven't done it in so long that I'm sure you'd have a little pain. There is always one or two little things that I'll never forget, if I even remember them."</p> <p>He took a deep breath and continued. "When we first started this weekend I knew something was missing. There was something missing the first time the women that I work with had seen me at the pool."</p> <p>Jemma had tears in her eyes as she looked up at the man and whispered, "What is it?"</p> <p>"I was caught in a lie that the women that I work with just aren't enough."</p> <p>"What did you tell them to say?"</p> <p>"There isn't anything to tell them. You are nothing but a cheating spouse and I'm not even sorry that I married you."</p> <p>"You didn't lie to me. You were the one that said that you're not cheating."</p> <p>"So I lied to them. I tried, but they couldn't believe it."</p> <p>"You were the one that said that I'm not cheating?"</p> <p>Jemma took a big breath through her clenched teeth and shook her head negatively. She lifted her head to the man and said, "There is no need to lie. It's just something that you have to find out for yourself."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>The man held up his right hand and slowly dragged it from her chin. Her eyes locked on his and she whispered, "I knew it." His hand then traveled down her neck to her left breast, holding it to his lips. He took that nipple between his teeth and began to suck on it. Jemma closed her eyes again and sighed. "Jemma! Jemma! I am not cheating on you!" The man took that as a rejection.</p> <p>"Then what is wrong with me?"</p> <p>"Nothing. Go get dressed."</p> <p>Jemma climbed out and began to put her clothes on. The man helped her and soon was back with his suit. Jemma sat back down, his eyes never leaving her. She then said something that made him look at her. She took his hand and pressed it firmly against her breast.</p> <p>"Jemma..."</p> <p>"Oh, yeah?"</p> <p>"This is wrong."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"No! I want you to do it. I know that you love me, but you canâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
