What exactly are you talking about?</p> <p>"Lorenzo, I like the way you talked to me. I think you have the most natural way of addressing people. I never think of you as 'boss' but you're actually kind of a 'cute' person. Do you really think I'm attractive?"</p> <p>"Yes, you're very attractive, if that's possible. Don't you see what's going on here?" I asked.</p> <p>She reached into her pocket and found she was holding something, which was about a thick rubber dildo, in her hand, which she placed in front of me. She held it up and smiled up at me. "You can't tell what this thing is. It's not your cock."</p> <p>"What it is, I have no idea of. I'm too busy with school." I said smiling back at her.</p> <p>"That's right, you're not too busy with school. You've been spending most of the day in school, making new money. This is really something. Did it turn you on?" She said.</p> <p>"You know it does. I feel more comfortable in this business than I have for any of my other life's." I said.</p> <p>"I'm glad you did. You can't be embarrassed by being in a lesbian club. You don't even care that these people here are your bosses; you just want to enjoy yourself. You know I do. I'd love for you to enjoy yourself too." She told me.</p> <p>"Are you sure? I won't embarrass you in front of them. I promise." I told her.</p> <p>"OK let's get going. We have business to make. You're a very attractive female. I mean that in both business and personal. Now we'll discuss my proposition for a moment. I won't get in the way of your pleasure. Right now we'll just make some preliminary work. There's a safe bet it will never happen again so don't worry. In a minute, I'll get up, you'll be on your knees." She said.</p> <p>We finished our coffee and left, both of us standing in various stages of undress. We exited the office, walked slowly in front of my naked wife and started to leave the room. She stopped, turned to me and smiled. "No! Keep going, I want to be with you and enjoy what we're doing. We've just gone to work. You'll never see me again."</p> <p>So this wasn't true, I decided. It had to do with something important I had in mind. She'd said we shouldn't be seeing each other, just that I could use my 'cute' business approach. I took her hand and led her by her hand around the back of one of the conference room tables. On the other table was my ex- secretary (she still called her 'Boss' because of all of the times I had used her) and another woman was talking to her, both of them in the same business-like fashion. Loren looked very much at the other woman's pussy. She smiled at me as my wife did the same.</p> <p>We followed our lead until we reached the end of the table and sat down. Before we could talk any further they each took a chair opposite our spouses. I sat next to Loren. I ordered another round of drinks, and sat opposite the person who had been the most important thing to me during my first five years of life. "It's been a long time since I've had any real interaction with anyone. I hope you like it." I said.</p> <p>"It's a pleasure to be with you, Mr. H. How are you?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm ready to quit the business." I told my wife. Loren rose to an arm's length and looked me in the eyes with an expression of passion. Her smile broadened as she said,"Yes, I'm all yours. Do you think you can handle seeing my husband again?"</p> <p>I smiled back at her and told her, 'Yes, if he makes me feel as much comfortable as he does about the sexual feelings I have with other men it seems he could live with that and never tell you it was my idea."</p> <p>She leaned into me and pressed her lips to mine. I felt a chill go up my back as I realized it was my ex- secretary (again as I knew she was my ex when we broke up). I had enjoyed the time we had together, both having done all types of things, but I was still married and a widow. I was happy that I was a widower but I was still in a relationship and needed a certain amount of comfort in that relationship.</p> <p>"We need to talk aboutâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
