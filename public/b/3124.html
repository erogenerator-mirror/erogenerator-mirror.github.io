I do love your lovely body, you are beautiful and intelligent and most of all you are a sexy person and you are a gorgeous and sexy person."</p> <p>With that, he slid his finger under my jaw and I opened my mouth to kiss him. His eyes were huge as they looked me up and down. He lifted his finger to his lips and as he did, I took his finger in my mouth and his eyes rolled back a bit.</p> <p>"Are you sure about this?" He gave me a devilish grin and we kissed some more, just for fun.</p> <p>"This kiss was incredible and you are absolutely so beautiful." I was feeling incredibly sexy, he could have stayed like that for so long, but he slowly eased me back onto the bed and we snuggled each other close again.</p> <p>That is until I felt him lift up my sundress, uncover my bare breasts and begin to kiss them. He was not gentle this time as he slowly teased me with his tongue, taking care not to stop, and making me very very, very wet.</p> <p>I pushed his head down and kissed him, and then licked his upper lip to get some of his juice on it and then kissed his upper lip and slowly licked my way down across his jawline and neck. I slowly, and very carefully licked over his nipple and then back up to where it joined the neckline of his shirt. I repeated this a third time, and then kissed his lips, and then kissed him again. He did not stop me this time until I had had my turn at kissing him. I went on kissing him and licking his neck, licking and flicking his ears before kissing down to his chest and licking his nipples one more time.</p> <p>"Oh, that was so incredible." I told him. "You are certainly handsome, but not the way you look." I was smiling to myself about as much as he was. He was not at all bad looking either but he could have a better body, or perhaps he could have done less than look. I was sure he had a good body.</p> <p>"It's a good job you were wearing a bra, it helped keep you from being a 'hot' girl." I had been hoping that he had been seeing some of the "tities" that he had mentioned in passing, now I had heard him talking about them before.</p> <p>And I got a kick of it. That I was actually feeling sexy. And knowing that what I said could be said with his permission. I felt my heart rate start to quicken. I kissed him and ran my hand between his thighs, down to the front of his shorts. I was feeling the bulge there and that made my heart flutter again. I could feel his cock hardening from me playing with him.</p> <p>I pushed my hips into his and I reached down to feel his erection. He must have been getting harder as I stroked him. I gently caressed the length of his cock and when I realized it was very, very hard. It could have been 10 inches long and very thick. I slowly touched it and felt it jump in my hand like a mini cock. I could feel the pre cum that was oozing out of it. It felt like it was about the length of my forearm.</p> <p>"You are so sexy," he told me as he raised his hips slightly indicating his desire that he wanted me to touch him.</p> <p>When he did, I reached behind me and quickly unfastened my bra. I pulled it off and sat back on the bed, letting the bra drop to the floor. I reached around and I felt his cock jump as I caressed him again. His eyes were wide and he made a 'mmmm' sound as I brought both hands up to cup his balls which I then began to stroke. I kept stroking his balls and he moaned as I brought his cock to life and he seemed to be going in and out faster. He was breathing very heavily at that point too.</p> <p>I went back to slowly masturbating him, but I didn't want to rush things. I wanted to be with him. I wanted him to be satisfied and satisfied before we started making love.</p> <p>He looked at me with a huge grin on his face. He raised himself up a bit on the bed and I stood up and stood over him looking down at him. I was standing over him completely naked and I couldn't resist a good seeing that the bulge of his cock was almost gone. I stroked and stroked, and then leaned right over to kiss him again. I got a good grip on his cock and used my other hand to slowly put my mouth on the head and slowly slid it down to get more air which I did by swirling my tongue around the tip. I slowly eased it down farther andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
