"Don't stop, please, not again, don't stop, I'll... I'll let you do anything you want, but keep fucking me, please." He couldn't believe he was asking this and that made him a cuckolded man. He thought about fucking her again, but decided that it was more to have her there.</p> <p>"Anything, Sir?"</p> <p>"I don't know, girl. Please... I... it's been too long, but I..." He was so out of control his head was spinning. He'd seen everything and was in total ecstasy.</p> <p>She pulled out of him, got up and moved in front of him.</p> <p>It wasn't like him at all. He couldn't say it, but it was true, it was real. He hadn't said it before, it was so fucking real. He wanted it to continue being a one on one session with her, with him, and then they'd be together again, forever.</p> <p>She leaned down and kissed him over his lips, his tongue and then his cheeks as she pushed him over onto his back. He felt her legs come apart around his waist and then she was pulling him down as she lowered her pussy towards his mouth.</p> <p>Before he knew what she was doing another inch of him entered her and he was inside of her completely. She lifted him up with her legs and then dropped back down on his cock.</p> <p>It was so fucking good. They were both so into making love, it was so much more intense.</p> <p>"I want.... I want...."</p> <p>"I know," she said as she began moving up and down on him. She was bouncing just a bit more, grinding her crotch against him. "I want you to come in my mouth. I want it all over my face". She squeezed her legs together and took him hard in her mouth and then started stroking up and down his cock and then she let him fill her mouth with his hot cum.</p> <p>"I can't..."</p> <p>"Yes, you can," she said as she continued sucking on him while she stroked his cock with her fist and lips in her eyes. "Oh, you look so sexy! You really are something!"</p> <p>Her words were really turning him on, but he didn't have to go so far back. He wanted her to suck his cock. "I'm going to.... I'm going to come."</p> <p>He couldn't believe he was talking to himself like this, but he was, and that was enough to trigger him.</p> <p>She squeezed her thighs together one last time as she looked up at him with her eyes glazed over and her hand slowly jerking up and down his cock a little faster and with more pressure.</p> <p>"Come, girl, come up to me... come in my mouth. I want to taste you, cum in my mouth. Let me swallow all of you." She tightened her lips on his cock, pressed him hard a little more and then went back to sucking him off as she looked up at him with his cock still in her grip in her other hand. She let out an animalistic noise, letting come explode into her mouth as she looked up at him with her eyes as well.</p> <p>He was in ecstasy. He had never ever come like this before and he started to shake as his dick got harder and harder as it erupted and shot his wad into her mouth again and again, and again, a couple times. It felt so good.</p> <p>It was then she let his cock slip from her mouth and began to lick him with her tongue as he came out from her mouth. "Mmmm," she said as she continued to lick her fingers.</p> <p>Then she looked straight at his face as she leaned up over him and they began kissing again.</p> <p>He loved how she kissed him. He wanted to kiss her too. In the darkness he could just feel her body heat from her skin, her breathing, her thighs, under her hands and thighs and it was enough to get him excited again. He wanted to be with her, not just feel her, but also feel all her emotions and emotions, emotions that were making love to him and making them cum.</p> <p>He knew now it wouldn't do to just have an emotional relationship with her. He wanted to spend time just letting her feel what it was like to just be close to him and let him in.</p> <p>But, after a while if they could work together there was so much more, and if they could work together they never let their desires get the better of their control.</p> <p>It was the first time in his experience that he'd ever been in this position with someone like her, just feeling her naked body against his and kissing, not to mention being in her naked room andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
