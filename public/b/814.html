"You're so fucking hot. I can't wait to tell that gorgeous little wife of yours with the big tits I just fucked all over town," he said to himself as he walked into the bedroom. He closed the bedroom door behind him and then quickly stripped down to his boxer's. He then went to the bathroom next to the hallway as his cock was ready to explode. He got on the bathroom counter to put in the shower but saw that the shower door opened a little and the light came on.</p> <p>"I told her tonight was our last night," he heard her say as he peeked around the doorway.</p> <p>"I know. I can't wait to share it with those two of them again," he thought to himself as he stared hungrily at her. The thought of her telling them all about him on the phone flashed into his head while he put the shower on. "So, how's your trip going?" he asked as he turned the shower spray over and watched as her reflection came into view. She turned to him and smiled at him.</p> <p>"I have a few more stops to go, but I'm going to call your wife soon," she said. "She may not be home yet," she added as she turned to walk to the shower door. He watched her walk away from him, her legs crossed, his cock bulging against the fabric of his pants.</p> <p>"Have a good time," he heard her say before she locked the bedroom door and then he heard the water begin to run down her body until it cascaded into her hair.</p> <p>"I'll be ready when she gets back," he said as he watched her get into the shower and begin to rinse herself off with the soft material of the towel. "Have fun," she said to him as she shut off the water. "See you soon," she said as she went back into the guestroom.</p> <p>He waited a few minutes and then walked out from the bedroom. "Did you get her back?" he asked as his eyes drifted away from her for a brief moment.</p> <p>"Yeah. I got her."</p> <p>"Did she tell anything about what we were doing?" he wondered to his self as he took one last lingering look at that beautiful face of hers as she turned and took the towel off of herself. She came out of the bathroom and turned to face away from him as she dried herself off and got out of the bathroom. "Is she going to be all right over here in a second?" she asked as she reached her hand back to turn off the lights when he turned and saw her standing in front of him.</p> <p>"Yes," he heard him reply as he looked back at her. She was so beautiful. He was completely captivated by her and could not believe how hot and sexy she was. He knew that no man, no matter how much he wished he was that way, would ever want her. He had a feeling that she really was going to have the time of his life. He looked her over and wanted to grab her right then, kiss her, but knew he could wait.</p> <p>"Did she tell you about it?" she asked him as she sat down in front of him as he sat down to stare as he stared at her, noticing her perfect breasts hanging down as she did up her hair again. There was a subtle hint of her dark hair against her pink nipples, which he noticed instantly. He reached his hand out to touch them but she grabbed his hand and stopped him.</p> <p>"Wait, wait," she said and then stood up and walked towards him. As she got to him she reached out her hand towards his, he took it in his and she leaned forward and kissed him. She tasted like chlorine and when their lips parted for a moment, he looked into her eyes and could tell she liked what he was seeing because something was definitely different about her now that they weren't kissing so much.</p> <p>As they broke their kiss, she took his hand and they walked into the hall to the spare room. As they got in the door, she reached over and grabbed his cock. "It's still rock hard," she said staring into his eyes while holding he cock in her hand. He leaned back as she brought her lips up to the tip of his cock and then down onto it just inches from her face. She held him there for moment as she stared at him.</p> <p>"What did she tell you?" she asked as she opened her mouth and took him inside. "Did she tell you how big it is?" she said to him as her mouth slid up and down his dick.</p> <p>"Yes. She told me how big and thick," he moaned as she worked her lips up and down his shaft, taking him a little deeper each time.
