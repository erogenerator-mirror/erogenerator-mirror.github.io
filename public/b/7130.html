Yes! YES!"</p> <p>She came in buckets and I was right there too to see everything. I held all my weight off my body without letting any cum get anywhere. It was a relief to stay that way for a while and then, finally, she collapsed on the bed. I was in the middle of her body, in that big bed! What a feeling, I thought to myself. And it took less than a minute to come to an abrupt conclusion and the truth to the story!</p> <p>She was still breathing heavily, "Okay?" I asked.</p> <p>She smiled and nodded, "Thank you."</p> <p>"My pleasure. I think we better get cleaned up, then we can be going, if you want to. You might have to go first."</p> <p>She rolled over onto her back and laughed for a second, "That was interesting," she said, "I still don't see how I could have had the courage to get you in bed without asking you to!" She was still lying on her stomach, so I decided to go ahead and say it out loud.</p> <p>"Okay, you were right. I hadn't meant to...to ask you to go first, that's all, all right" I said, "and I love you for not rejecting me. And...and you were right. It's just that..."</p> <p>She smiled as I continued, "You're right. I'm sorry I'm so nervous about everything else. I'm just, I'm not sure what to say."</p> <p>She raised one finger, "So, do you want to stay with us? I would like that."</p> <p>I rolled over to her, "I would like that, but then there are going to be a lot of other people."</p> <p>She smiled, "So? I'd love to stay with you." She raised her fingers, "And I like it here. I'm not mad at you though, I just want to feel safe here. I like to just keep feeling safe and excited. I...just do what I read people in magazines and get into bed as natural."</p> <p>I laughed, "Do you want to go?"</p> <p>"Okay," she sighed, "but I don't mean to take advantage of you."</p> <p>"What?" I asked, "if I want to, do what you read. It's not... I just like it here."</p> <p>"I think it's okay. Come back if you want to..."</p> <p>I rolled on my side.</p> <p>"Okay. I'll stay."</p> <p>"Well, I don't need you to, now, I just want you to feel safe here. It is just different from here. You can just stay here when you feel like it."</p> <p>She was staring at the ceiling with her mouth open and her hand still down below her. I didn't think she could possibly have felt safe and excited, if she weren't so confident. What an odd feeling.</p> <p>"And?" I prompted, "are you sure?"</p> <p>She rolled over onto her stomach, "Yeah, so I'm sure. And it will definitely be worth the sacrifice."</p> <p>I rolled on my side, "You're sure?"</p> <p>She nodded, "Positive. It will just take a little time to get used to the idea." I could hear her breath getting more shallow, "And the sooner the better."</p> <p>My heart thumped even harder against my rib cage, "I wouldn't be a complete ass if I didn't say that."</p> <p>She grinned in my direction and my heart beat a little faster. "Do you really think so?"</p> <p>"Yes, I do," I whispered, "but we'll talk about that when we're going to bed."</p> <p>"Me too," she whispered.</p> <p>"But don't be afraid to say... okay?"</p> <p>"Well, there are a lot of things to talk about. Don't get confused, okay?"</p> <p>"I won't," she said, her hand still below her as if she were about to do something else.</p> <p>I couldn't say anything right then, "I'm not sure how you feel. I don't mean to pressure you, but I have to be honest. I never wanted to have to admit that I didn't like you. I just...I don't know what..."</p> <p>"Please don't be confused," she said, "I know you don't like me either, but I want to be upfront, to make you understand how I feel."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"Thank you for being honest and not pressuring me, you're a real lifesaver. I'm grateful that you're going to fall madly in love with me."</p> <p>"No, I'm not mad, I think the whole thing means a lot to you."</p> <p>"I think I agree.
