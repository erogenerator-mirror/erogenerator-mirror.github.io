Jake prompted.</p> <p>"Don't I have a say in your happiness?" Sarah asked.</p> <p>"Are you serious?"</p> <p>"Fuck you," Sarah said, "what else would I want to know. And you just gave me permission to stay here, while you live your life."</p> <p>"You'd do that for me? You said so on the first day of your marriage."</p> <p>"That's what I said on Thursday," Sarah said.</p> <p>"I don't care," Jake said, a little wistfully. "Do you think I should come to your place and marry you? It wouldn't be the wedding of the century, and this would be just the start. The end of our marriage."</p> <p>"Yes, we agreed. Don't you want this marriage?"</p> <p>"Of course I do. I'll have you at my side every day of the week."</p> <p>"Oh. I... I'm sorry."</p> <p>"You don't have to be sorry," Jake said. "I love you, Sarah."</p> <p>That's what this morning was for. Now I have to put that plan into action.</p> <p>"So," Sarah said before Jake could say anything else, "what are you proposing?"</p> <p>"Sarah..."</p> <p>"What do you want, Jake?"</p> <p>Jake turned to her. "Sarah, I've come to an agreement with you, in my mind. I have an arrangement with you, that we are happy to do it with no strings attached, no judgments, no consequences. This house belongs to me. I'm doing it for us."</p> <p>Sarah smiled at him. "We will get married in just a few months, in front of your eyes, and I'll do everything I can for you. And if you want, you can marry me here on the first day of our marriage, even if we have to spend the weekend at my parents' place."</p> <p>Jake laughed. "I'll do anything I can to keep you."</p> <p>"I want you to be a part of it."</p> <p>They sat and discussed it. Jake said he'd had a little more to drink, and they left the bar without any more talk.</p> <p>"I'll do it, Jake," Sarah said, as they walked through the doors. He had a hard time walking normally, and his body went numb.</p> <p>When they got back to his car, she asked, "So how does it go?"</p> <p>"It will be like getting married, right?"</p> <p>"This will be my decision to make," Sarah said. "I'll pick you when we get married."</p> <p>As the couple drove from the address that Jake had given them, Sarah's heart began to beat faster. She wasn't sure that she wanted it to be Jake, in fact, she was not sure that she wanted to be married.</p> <p>Sarah opened her car door and they climbed into the back. Jake got out first, and started the car. Sarah got out a minute later, and followed him into his home. It had grown a quarter of a mile and was a little over a mile away from her neighborhood.</p> <p>When they got to the door, Sarah pulled away from Jake and took her hand. They had been silent a few minutes. Jake looked at Sarah; she looked nervous and her eyes were dark. "Sarah," he said, gently, "you have to trust me to keep quiet. I'm giving you a choice right now that I can't tell if you feel ready."</p> <p>Sarah's face was a big bright pink. "I know what I want," she said. "I've been thinking and fantasizing about having a good time with the two of you again. I want that to happen tonight."</p> <p>While Jake and Sarah talked, they went back to their places on the couch.</p> <p>"You should tell Sarah what you want," Jake said. "It will make her feel as if she's part of the family with you."</p> <p>"Jake," Sarah began, and stopped. She hesitated before she reached out and kissed Jake. "When we met, I thought that you might think that I was a little weird for trusting you."</p> <p>"That's the thing about trust," Jake said. "It's a man's first time, and there's no harm in feeling."</p> <p>"You're right."</p> <p>"Sarah, you know that I have no problem giving a man a blowjob sometimes."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"I've watched the girls, and I know their needs, all right."</p> <p>"Well," Sarah said, "there are some other things. Would you like to see some of them?"</p> <p>"Sure," Jake replied, and turned to Sarah. "Will you do it?"</p> <p>Sarah didn't answer at first, just looked at him with raisedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
