She said with a small smile as she stood.</p> <p>He smiled back at her, but knew they would have to leave for a moment. He wanted to take her for a minute but when he opened the door and started for his car he didn't want to risk a repeat of what he had just had. He hoped he had done a good job at it and she did not seem to know how good a man he had become. He opened the door for her without so much as a word and he could hardly keep his hands off of her. He smiled at her as he closed the door and he could swear he heard her mutter something about that being a good time.</p> <p>He opened his eyes to find her standing before him. He looked up to look into her eyes and saw the lust and wonder in hers. His breath caught momentarily at the sight before his eyes. He had never had the desire of having sex before this moment but it was with a woman who loved to be dominated. Her smile told him he was pleasing and it pleased him. Her short hair fell over her face. Her body was slender and perfectly proportioned. Her breasts were barely larger than his head barely filling his hands. He felt her eyes boring into him. They were dark brown and he had trouble looking at them even with the light of the street lamp. She stared back at him. She had the same hungry look in her eyes as she used to when she was just looking about.</p> <p>Her smile widened and widened even more. Her breath was almost escaping her lips. She had caught her breath and she pulled her hand from his and brought it back up to her breast. Her nipple was already hard and she took her hand away from her chest and brought it to him. She licked her lips and she ran her tongue across them and then back, slowly down across her chest. He took her hand and led her to his car. Their eyes never left each other even though they knew the moment was about to happen, but neither of them knew if it was going to happen, but neither had the willpower to look away.</p> <p>It was only a few blocks to his apartment building which meant he would be home within the hour. She smiled at the image he was driving and then she dropped her hand from his and reached it for the top of his boxers. She pulled them down and let his erection pop out. There was a little something on his cock that was quite a contrast from the rest of him. It was a bit on the smaller side but that was probably the thing that caused a slight drop in his blood flow. She took it in her hand and looked at the head with a question in her eyes. He smiled back and he reached over her head and ran his hand down her bare back. He looked over her shoulder and knew he would get into her in the end. She smiled at him and slowly turned around. She walked back to him, bent over, and pulled her own tank top over her head. She turned and looked at him. He was completely naked and stood there waiting until she pulled her tank top over her head but she was standing in front of him with him and his hard cock in front of her face. They could do nothing but stare at each other's naked bodies for what seemed like an eternity.</p> <p>As soon as the thought entered his head they knew it was going to happen. His cock instantly hardened and began to drip precum. He grabbed her hips and pulled her closer to him. Her back pressed against his chest and she bent over a little. He reached under her and pulled her ass cheeks apart. He heard her breath catch in her throat. He could feel his head push against her pussy lips and he wanted very much to reach inside of her, even though his cock was so hard he thought it would actually rip her. She looked over at him and he felt a sense of relief. She knew how much he was enjoying and this made her proud.</p> <p>"I will be a little rough on you." He teased her and she smiled at his tone. He knew the answer. She nodded her head in affirmation so he pulled her hair and he brought his mouth down to hers and began to kiss her. Her kiss was full of passion and lust. He pulled away long enough to tell her "You are my little fuck toy. Tonight you will be my toy. It is time for me to make my mark. I will claim you as mine." He pulled her back to him and kissed her again.</p> <p>"Please, I need to cum." she said through the kisses.</p> <p>"But I have to be home in time. I don't want you coming right into the apartment while your husband is there to watch!" he exclaimed and kissed her again. She moved her hands down and grabbed onto his hard cock. She started to stroke it and it felt as hard as a man.
