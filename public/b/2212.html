She started to moan very softly again and I knew I had her. Not only that, but she reached a hand down and started to caress my balls which meant it wasn't going to take much time. I was starting to moan loudly now, and she knew it. She started pumping in and out of me a bit faster now as I started to move. She continued to stroke me hard, while sucking my balls, and as well I was trying to keep control of the situation. She sucked me a few extra times, then started to move the tip of my cock into her pussy and slide herself down slowly. I could sense how much she wanted it as well, and I could feel it on every inch of my cock. Just feeling her velvety warm pussy wrap itself around my manhood was just heaven.</p> <p>I could hear her breathing more heavily now though, and I knew I was going to cum quickly. I thrust as hard as I could into her as I felt myself starting to unload, and she felt it. She was in ecstasy with having cumming from my cock entering her.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, baby...don't stop...that's it." I was starting to moan louder now, trying desperately to keep control.</p> <p>"Cum in me, lover." She was moaning loudly in my ear now, pushing herself back onto me.</p> <p>"Are you still as close to my cock, as I planned?" I said to her.</p> <p>"Not quite yet," she responded. "Keep it in me. I want to feel you there, as far as it goes..."</p> <p>"That's good," I whispered in her ear, still trying not to cum yet.</p> <p>"That's perfect...yes, just like that." She started moving herself back into me even more, and as she did she pulled her legs upwards so that my cock could go deeper into her. My cock slipped in and out of her a couple more times, and I could feel the wetness of her pussy juice dripping down the front of my legs. It was enough to make my cock feel so good that I started to cum and she could feel as well. There was only one more inch I could go in this time, and she started to really ride me hard from behind.</p> <p>"God, your cock feels so good," she said aloud and started to kiss me. "Oh, you are the sweetest fuckin' man I've ever had."</p> <p>After a few minutes of slowly riding me, she broke away from the kiss and just smiled.</p> <p>"I've got some more to get to," she said as she removed herself from me. "I'm going to need a couple of minutes to recover, so lay down on the couch and I'll be right back." She disappeared into the bathroom and came back with a bottle of lotion, and a couple of condoms.</p> <p>"Do I need these to take my load?" she asked, putting them on my dick.</p> <p>"No, I'm good. I'm really enjoying myself the best I've ever been. Don't worry about it." She kissed me on my lips after putting them in place, "You know you're not wearing much, and I can feel your cum inside me on our first try." She grabbed my dick in my hand and started to stroke me in and out of her.</p> <p>"So how much longer are we supposed to leave the room?" I wondered how the condom I put on had worked. Her pussy felt so good. I didn't think I could cum so quick, but when I felt cum running out of her and down the inside of her thighs, I decided to make it work. I started to thrust into her harder and harder with each stroke and her breathing had increased dramatically, indicating that she was having the time of her life. She leaned back down onto the couch and reached down with her right hand to hold my cock still as she started to play with herself. The sounds of our bodies coming together were getting louder and louder, sounding more and more like our mouths were actually fucking each other. I was looking forward to fucking her in a hotel room all the while, with the knowledge that this was going to be our final night.</p> <p>"Let's go upstairs." I whispered to her as we left the couch.</p> <p>"That's a great idea," she said.</p> <p>She grabbed the condom and pulled me to her lips as she sat on the couch. She looked at me in my face and smiled, then leaned down so that our lips were practically touch as she wrapped her arms around my neck. Her lips were so soft, like they had just been wrapped around a kiss. I reached my hand down into her pubes and pulled on herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
