"Let's go for coffee."</p> <p>I sat up and pulled my tank-shirt and shorts back on. I looked around and did a quick tour of the house for a minute before coming back and picking up my shoes which I carried to the back bedroom and sat back down. I had to sit down too to keep a straight face as I felt my heart skip a beat.</p> <p>I went back through the kitchen for breakfast and looked around and then put the groceries in the fridge. I opened the refrigerator and found two beers hanging on the counter and the refrigerator door was open. I went back to the kitchen and grabbed two more. I returned to the living room and sat down on the couch. I had a sudden urge to sit down next to him but for the life of me I could not. I pulled out a chair and sat down. I felt a strong urge to make it right as I picked up the food and looked at the pictures of him. I had never seen any of the pictures. Not from him, not when we dated, not when I went out on a date, not in one of his movies. But in those pictures, with him there, looking at them, watching me, he made every other person in my life something special.</p> <p>My mind wandered back to some of his stories. I knew why, I loved them, but I could not find it in him as he did. They had all been true. I felt that he should do the same thing so that he could show the world the real me, but this time he hadn't. He had just taken advantage of the situation that he had met in the store, and I was afraid that I would feel him take advantage of me again once I was out of the house.</p> <p>I had never done any of his fantasy things before, so why had I ever thought that he would take advantage of me again? I decided to give it a chance. I would make sure that I was always in the mood to do things this way.</p> <p>I picked up the picture of him on the bed and put my arm over his chest. The hand that I hadn't touched him with before rested on my thigh. It was an action that I was not about to take, but had to try again. I took the picture and put his hand on one of me and I let him guide me. He was the one doing the guiding. We touched each other. I opened my eyes to see his face in the picture and I was shocked. It was the face that he had described so many times. He was smiling at me. That wasn't his face. There was nothing there but a smiling face with the same white hair that I kept growing back. My eyes followed his hand until he picked it up and moved it over to me. I looked into his eyes and let go and let him do the same. We touched each other's hands together and we touched our fingers together. Our eyes closed and our body heat matched, our fingers intertwined, and we were lost in this experience. We both felt connected to each other.</p> <p>I brought my arm up and laid it on his shoulder. He held me. I hugged him tightly but I did not feel him press against me. I felt him close to me. We held that position for a long time. When I felt him relax in my arms I knew that he was ready to move on. I felt safe and loved that he felt it too and did not reject me.</p> <p>He looked at me after a while and then he kissed me on the cheek. I leaned on him and hugged him. I really wanted to do this with him. I felt safe and was happy in his arms. I could tell he was feeling the same thing.</p> <p>After a while we decided to go upstairs with our breakfast. I went in first and he followed. We ate breakfast in silence and watched some movie on the end of the couch. We talked and laughed as he did things with me. I felt guilty again. I didn't want to be doing this with someone like that even if it made me feel good. My whole life had gone so much better than this. It had always been different between us. We were in love, but I felt that for him there was no going back. It was that moment when the world was moving in the same direction that it had been for me. He had just been in love with me and I was in love with him. We stood together and I hugged him tightly and he turned and stared into my eyes. I felt a strange feeling inside of me. We both wanted the love that he had for me. I told him that for myself I felt like he was mine. He smiled and said that I didn't feel the same way. He was still in love with me and that I felt really connected to him in a way that he wasn't.</p> <p>I broke the eye contactâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
