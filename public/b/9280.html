As a result, she wanted to do all of it now to feel that strange sensation again. She slid down and lifted his cock and gently wrapped her fingers around the base and slid it up and down into her vagina, spreading the moisture around and then stroking back down again. The movement brought her legs up and closed around him, her thighs pressing against his. His hands fell away from his body, his body leaving her pussy to rest on hers for the next three minutes.</p> <p>She was in bliss, the tingly feeling of her legs and thighs caressing his hardness, that strange sensation of being stretched inside. Her fingers pressed into her sex in search of that same tingling, as did the movements of her body. He pulled away from her and sat up, the water still splashing down on them.</p> <p>"Mmmm, this feels so good," she said, not really wanting to admit it to him. "We have to slow down." He helped her up and gently guided her into the tub behind them. The water was starting to cool, and she wondered where it would settle with the temperature. They dried off in the bathroom and sat on the bed, holding hands.</p> <p>"I know this feels weird, but I think that's the same way we've been doing it for me." Her voice was shaky as she continued her story. "We're in the bedroom, and that's a new experience. Sometimes I just want to get on the bed with you, cuddling up against you." She saw him grin, that infectious, sexy look in his eyes. Her legs were suddenly bare and very warm and she felt warm in her belly. She took his hand and leaned over his body and looked down at the tenting of cloth inside his robe. "I feel so warm, and you're hard. I want us to do this again. I'll rub my leg against your erection right now."</p> <p>In the darkness, the thought of what she was saying was very arousing, and his grin grew wider. He lifted her chin so she could see him. "How does that feel?"</p> <p>"It's different than doing it in my room, and...it feels strange, exciting. A little different though. But I'm in the mood to enjoy it again. So we can be more comfortable now. I think that means, if we want to, we could get each other off by touching..." Her words were slurring as she spoke these words.</p> <p>"I like that," he said, his hand still sliding over her belly, "because it makes me feel good to know that you like doing this. I'd really like it if you would be doing it with someone else."</p> <p>She smiled up at him. "That sounds perfect, but I think I could be more comfortable if you come up here with me." Her hand slid his robe down his arms, her fingers running along the ridges of his chest. "You've wanted to do this to me so badly for so long, haven't you?"</p> <p>"Of course I have. I've been hard since I met you but now I want you so badly." She slid down next to him and laid her head on his chest. "I'm glad to have you around me again."</p> <p>He reached up and kissed her mouth, then her cheek. "I'm glad of that." The kiss went on for several minutes, and he thought his erection was going to burst from his pants.</p> <p>"Mmmm," she said, sitting up a bit and reaching out to grab his hand. "I'm so wet and sticky."</p> <p>"It's not that bad," he replied, squeezing her hand. "It's the excitement of doing this again."</p> <p>"Would you like me to rub you?" This wasn't exactly a question he'd ever asked her before, in fact, even to be truthful.</p> <p>His heart skipped a beat at the thought of that. But her offer was certainly an invitation.</p> <p>She lay down next to him on the bed, and lifted his hand to her breast. "I'd like that too."</p> <p>She took his hand and rubbed the head of his cock between her nipples, making it jump.</p> <p>"Mmm," moaned his lover. "Mmmm-hmm."</p> <p>They kissed for a few moments, and then his right hand slid down over her stomach. He found the soft lips of her pussy, where she was just as wet and wet as herself was. He slid a finger inside her as his thumb massaged her clit. She raised her hips and his finger slipped inside her, while another hand began pushing down on the cheeks of her ass.</p> <p>Her legs opened wider as his right hand continued pressingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
