Give it to me good!"</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>I got the pizza, and sat and ate it and watched the television for a little bit longer, and then I called Gina and gave her the details. This is our first foray into the world of BDSM. I'm about to start with the standard introductory session with you.</p> <p>You must be my sub. Gina, your loving and gentle Goddess, is your subject, as long as she is willing. I am sure you have read this before, and I know my role is to do as you ask. If you like, I will be naked and kneeling in front of you.</p> <p>Now I don't give a flying shit what happens if I don't get it. But you are not to touch my dick or balls (not that that will be a problem since it would be easy, since I do a lot of that myself). And I will only let my hands brush against you. You are welcome to run your hands over your body. Whatever you want. I am very open with my hands, you are totally at my request... as long as you are wearing a condom! I have only the one I am using.</p> <p>In case I forgot, I may be an asshole, but the thing is, I know what to say, and you are a loving and tender person.</p> <p>Now, what did she say while we were talking about that?</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>Sara (or Jenny)</p> <p>I had some homework to do. That would be my final grade, and I would need it.</p> <p>Now, please be seated in one of the comfortable chairs in front of me. Make sure you are dressed as you are when you arrive. When you arrive I will be standing at your side, with my hands on each side of you, leaning back and closing your eyes. You are not to move. I want you to visualize this as you come.</p> <p>Do I read the signs to be sure? The ones I have been reading (I had to pick up a few to be sure). This is part of the learning process.</p> <p>You must hold this in your hand, and move your hand down toward your sex. Don't touch your pussy! The same rule applies to all other parts of your body.</p> <p>Do you hold this in your hand in one hand? When you are ready (or not) I want you to move to the bed at your right side. I want you to turn over. You are to be on all fours as I remove your blindfold.</p> <p>Do you place a condom on with this?</p> <p>I am your partner. You may use it if you like.</p> <p>Do you want a condom?</p> <p>I don't, and the condom is mine and you will never use it.</p> <p>I know you are ready. This will not mean anything to you if you don't ask. However, a condom is a lot of fun.</p> <p>Now sit.</p> <p>I could see that was not Gina's idea. I had learned that most everyone else did everything she told me. So once again, just be yourself. We were still playing the game, so I decided to pick her up, and have her kneel down on the bed in front of me, while I got undressed for her. I looked down and saw a pair of panties, and I had never seen her have one before... that was one thing I knew for sure.</p> <p>I opened my legs and gestured for her to remove mine. Her eyes widened as soon as they saw my hard-on. I had her kneel on the bed, and I pulled on a condom and opened it for her to roll it down, and then I took my cock and rubbed it up and down a couple of times, and then I put on the condom while she was still kneeling, watching me carefully.</p> <p>I leaned back on the bed, and placed the head of my rod right at her entrance, just below the tip... the tip that is. I had no experience with this. I wanted her to see the way she was going to have to face me, to anticipate it. Her eyes were on fire. "Do you have a condom?" she asked.</p> <p>I didn't need to be asked, but I knew I could, so I told her that she did, and she looked at me as if asking to be a naughty girl for me to be a naughty man for her. I knew exactly what she was going to ask, and I was sure she was a naughty girl for me. She must've thought I was going to take her. She must think I was trying to be a naughty guy.</p> <p>I told her I would do anything for her and she nodded, and smiled and thenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
