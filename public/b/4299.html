I think they're trying to make sure there's nothing else in my mind.' But it was so hard to say something like 'I'm not sure I could handle this,' without getting offended.</p> <p>Laughing, I stepped back from her, and said, "No kidding. Just because you have a guy at the office isn't such a big deal, is it?"</p> <p>Turning back in place, she began to rub her hands nervously.</p> <p>"Listen, I'm sorry. This is kind of embarrassing..."</p> <p>"Don't worry about it. It's actually kind of fun, it's more like... a guy's game," I said with a smile. "That's the trouble with me being gay. I mean, there's another part of guys I want to be with, and I get so scared sometimes...that it's hard to stop."</p> <p>"No, don't be so worried there. You're a hot guy with all my heart. And I love looking at you." A mischievous smile crept on her face as she continued to blush. "Plus, I see other guys around somewhere, and you guys are fun...like that."</p> <p>I shrugged my shoulders, and thought, 'Oh, the possibilities. I suppose I should take her up on it, but I've got to get my head on straight before I do anything that might piss her off.'</p> <p>With that, I continued on my way. I was going to tell her this time, but then she turned around, and we continued our silent exchange. When we came to an intersection, she looked at me and asked, "Are you leaving?"</p> <p>"Nope, just stopping for a quick dip in the hot tub," I said.</p> <p>She chuckled, and asked, "What do you mean?"</p> <p>"I mean, if you're not wearing panties tonight, I'd suggest you come over and let me put these on," I said giving her a mock stern expression. "Come on."</p> <p>"Oooh, that sounds kinky," she said with a nervous laugh.</p> <p>"You're right. I guess I can't really do that, but that would be so cool," I said as I slid my fingers underneath the hem of her bikini bottoms, and felt over her butt.</p> <p>Her response was, "Aww, you're naughty," before putting her arms around my neck as she squirmed around in response. The way her body felt against me was almost comical to me, and I found myself becoming aroused more than I ever had before. The heat between her legs was increasing every second, and her face was becoming flushed. I'm not sure if it was embarrassment or arousal, but we managed to get in the hot tub without getting arrested.</p> <p>We didn't have to have any clothes on, because I had them on pretty quickly and we spent many minutes rubbing each other everywhere we could get out of our suits. While we had the chance on this spot to feel each other up and kiss, the only other part that was actually occupied wasn't the water, or the heat.</p> <p>As we stood, her eyes were glued to my body. I was not embarrassed in the least, because I had to admit, it was kind of hot. My dick was harder than I can ever remember it ever being, and it was sticking straight out in my boxers. With her eyes still glued on my body, I leaned back against the side of the tub, spreading my legs apart as she followed suit with her hands. I watched as she rubbed her fingers over her pussy, which is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen, and I just looked her in the face as she did so.</p> <p>After rubbing her pussy for quite a while, she put her hand between her legs, and I could see the juices running down the inside of her leg. I leaned forward and slid my hand up her wet slit, feeling her hips move as my fingertips grazed over her pubic hair. I started to move my finger around the lips of her pussy, and when I finally slid two into her pussy, she gasped, "No one is ever going to make love with my panties on." Then after a few more circles, I slipped a third into her, and she gasped as I pushed them in and out.</p> <p>"What do you want me to do?" She asked as I pressed my hard dick against her leg. I slid my fingers into the waistband of her bottoms as I kissed her neck, and then whispered, "Mm, I know what you want." I could see her expression change, and she closed her eyes as I worked her panties off, throwing them onto the side, and slowly moved her hips again.</p> <p>When her hands came to rest on the inside of my thighs, I pushed my fingers into them asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
