I couldn't get enough, I couldn't get enough pussy!" As he stroked her clit she bucked hard, grinding her ass back against his dick, grinding herself onto him.</p> <p>"OHHHH GOD YES...FUCK ME! FUCK ME HARD FUCK ME HARD! OH YES!"</p> <p>John was mesmerized; fucking as hard and as deep as he could he watched her face for any signs of slowing down. Her legs were still wrapped around his back as she slammed them back over his shoulders, slamming back against his cock. His hands continued to play in her pussy, occasionally pulling her ass to meet his every thrust. Her eyes were half closed, head back as her cunt ground back against John's body, her fingers grabbing a handful of hair, her eyes locked onto his as she came over and over again. She continued to cum and then, for a few more seconds, she relaxed.</p> <p>He pulled his pants up, she gave a quick look up at him, and then turned and walked into the bathroom, stopping for a quick look at his dick. He quickly dressed and as she left he took a look down her blouse. "Fucking awesome!" She smiled up at him as she left.</p> <p>When she was in her car she looked back over at his apartment. "Fuck!" he said as he got into his car. Then he drove off, turning off the car.</p> <p>She didn't take a minute to finish her wine and then walked into his apartment and stood in front of him, almost crying. She stood in front of him, hands on her hips, looking him over, still looking him in the eyes. "I...I can't believe how hard it has been...how...it...it had been..." she started again, a little unsteadily. "...to...be able to...to be...turned on... by..." She looked up at him, biting her lip. "Being on my knees. I've...I've been...pissed by...by...you!" Her eyes were moist with alcohol, and she looked at him a long time before she finally leaned against him, sitting on his lap, facing him.</p> <p>"I...I don't know if...if it...it's just the alcohol...that turns me on. But...but..." she was still looking at him, a little afraid, "it still makes me...turned on." Her eyes were almost pleading. "Can't you see...about the things that...um...that happen...when I...you know what...when I was drunk...and..." she started again, looking at him, "...at what...um...you said..." then she started to smile. "Fuck that makes it hard." She laughed. "It makes it not hard. Do it...do it again...I'm ready to be fucked again tonight!" And then she just looked him again.</p> <p>He smiled, knowing she was as nervous as he was as he drove slowly over to her. His heart was beating like a drum, and he was amazed at how excited he'd felt getting home, and how he'd made her feel that evening...it almost seemed like a good idea...or a bad idea to do this...even if it was just on her knees. She had never said anything like that to him during their first date. She had always been kind and sweet and had always been polite and gentle and just listened to what he was trying to tell her. But he had also heard some of the things she had said in the past that just seemed as though she would never do it again...would never be as open about it as she had done. And now when he got closer she had been talking so...so much.</p> <p>When he arrived at her place he rang the doorbell a little while before she got a little drunk and then went into the kitchen to get out of her car. She was still a little dazed, but a bit relaxed. After he'd rang the doorbell she stepped back into the kitchen and stood with her back to him, her breasts hanging a little above her arm pits. She held out her finger to him to let him in, and he walked slowly over to her, taking in as much as he possibly could before backing up to her.</p> <p>She felt his huge hard cock pressing against her body as he stared at her. She put her hands on his chest and pushed him back and away. "NO!" she yelled. "Stay right there." Looking him over for any sign of recognition she reached for his belt. "John, wait..." she said as she quickly unbuckled him, then slowly pulled down his pants and shorts. When his cock finally came free she reached out and wrapped her hand around it, lifting one of his cock-slimy fingers to her mouth as she stared at his dick. He quickly closed his eyesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
