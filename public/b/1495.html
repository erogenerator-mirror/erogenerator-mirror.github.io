They climbed into bed together and immediately fell asleep. The next day, they were in bed when they felt him stir.</p> <p>"We have to talk, now," he whispered.</p> <p>"Not really. We'll have to wait for tomorrow to determine what happens tonight."</p> <p>"OK," he said. He gave her another kiss then turned out the light.</p> <p>He lay back on the bed and felt her hand slide down his body as she came to rest between his legs.</p> <p>"I can't."</p> <p>"What do you want me to say, now?" she asked.</p> <p>"You know I love to make love with you," he replied in a soft voice.</p> <p>At first, she said nothing, but then she did something that she had never done before. He had always thought she had always been a conservative but today, she surprised him even more.</p> <p>Suddenly, she bent her head down and began to make love to him. He felt her slide back up and began to undulate against his body.</p> <p>"Your clothes?" he questioned as was the first thing she put on for him.</p> <p>"I left them in the limo," she replied.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" he pressed.</p> <p>"No. You can't leave them on."</p> <p>He rolled on top of her and began to kiss her neck and down over her breasts. He felt her body stiffen in his arms when his lips made their way along her stomach. She opened her mouth to his and began to kiss him back, moaning softly when she felt his erection begin to press against her thigh.</p> <p>"Take off your clothes," he said, lifting his mouth from her breasts to kiss and lick at her navel. He then moved down, taking one of her breasts into his mouth and sucking it and rubbing the nipple with his tongue before continuing toward her body. He then slid his lips over her flat stomach and began to kiss and nibble at her crotch. He felt her hand stroke his head through his hair and then slid a fingertip between her legs until she felt his finger slide between his lips and touch his tongue. He raised his head and looked at her.</p> <p>"Do you want to know what this means for me?" she asked. She ran her fingers through his hair, holding him close to her. He leaned in close for a kiss then kissed her softly again then slid down her body until his mouth was at her crotch.</p> <p>"Now."</p> <p>"Yes," he said, opening his mouth as his head dipped between her legs. He felt her wetness on his lips and slid his tongue between her lips. She began to rock her hips against him as he licked up to her clit and began to lightly stroke her, bringing her quickly to the point of release. He felt her body tighten slightly around his tongue as she began to come. As she began to come down from her climax, he slowly pulled up and pulled her panties off, tossing them on the floor.</p> <p>Before he moved to mount her, he looked back at her. The hair on her pussy still covering her eyes, he turned to kiss her lightly once each on the lips then guided her toward the bed. There, he lay beside her and they began to make love.</p> <p>When he began to come, she felt him slowly thrusting into her and she could feel his juices running down over her thighs. Her body felt as though it were being used in a sexual way as his cock slowly began to pull itself out of her body. She reached between them, feeling his weight and the weight he was carrying, knowing it must feel as long as he was inside her. Their bodies rolled over until they were side-by-side, her on her back as she reached out to take hold of his cock.</p> <p>"Not yet," he said, stopping her for a moment as he rolled on top of her. He had felt her body move in response to his coming but he had never felt so contented. He knew that now was a time to end things because even though he loved her, he had never wanted to love anyone as much as he cared for her.</p> <p>"I love you," she whispered, staring up into his eyes.</p> <p>"I love you," he said into her eyes.
