You've lost your sense. You've lost your voice. You're losing your voice. You're a total wreck."</p> <p>I'm not the one he wanted to talk with. She doesn't even know yet. I can not imagine it is a decision that could change. I do know he's in a deep conversation with a couple people who just had to go by himself.</p> <p>"Why, Dara, I don't know."</p> <p>"Because that's not your problem. You can talk about it and come out with something that fits. That's where you're at."</p> <p>"Dara, I don't have a choice. I choose to be with you. Yours. No one else's."</p> <p>"Why? Why do you think you are supposed to be with me?"</p> <p>"Because you will. Because I have a special request for things of such magnitude. I have to be the one that will change your life."</p> <p>"You've got it. You know what I mean. You're special. I'm special."</p> <p>"Then why are you being so concerned that you have to get through this with me? You're not even sure who I am, but if you were to get in one of my shoes you don't own it. You've never been to my home. Your parents might throw you out of their house. You're too young to be my mother in her condition yet you have the strength to be with me and not break up with me."</p> <p>"Maybe I should start over again."</p> <p>"How should I know?"</p> <p>"That's up to you. I know we've been through lots and I also know we need to talk about it. We need to get this out of our system and we need to go on with it. Maybe it will change the way you see it. But you have to be the one. I'm sure you don't want to start over."</p> <p>Dara's eyes are shining and I know she is looking at me. She's thinking. I can tell she's thinking. We need to talk again the next time she goes with someone.</p> <p>"You know we've been through so much and I don't want the day to end either. Do you think that's what you're going to do next? You won't have to change anything in the world. Things change with time and we can't change with the right person. You will be a different person but you won't lose control of your life. You will become more in tune with the people surrounding you even with all the people you have. They can give you permission to do whatever they want with you and you can live life without them. You won't have those restrictions to change. Your life with me will continue."</p> <p>I am stunned. Dara sees in me my whole life has changed. I can't ask her to keep going with me and she will. I don't want to say or do anything for fear that her own life will stop. I am not the kind of guy who will run off the road and tell her that she had to do this.</p> <p>"Dara, this is serious."</p> <p>"It is. This isn't going to be some kind of fairy tale."</p> <p>"It won't be anything you know. I can't promise you anything but I won't keep it from you. We have talked about this. We have to talk about things, but it's not just about how you want to change your life for me. I love you and I want to be with you. I don't want to lose that, but if you don't want to do this it's perfectly okay. I don't want to be your mother or your wife.</p> <p>"It's not about you going with other people. I just want everything to be okay for you. I want you to go out with someone to be happy, but you have to be honest and see things the way you want them to be, not what you think they should be. I think there are lots of things in life that you can't change and that you haven't considered the consequences. You have to take a hard decision for yourself. You have to try and be yourself. Maybe not always like you think it should be.</p> <p>You might start to understand, but then you know that sooner or later you will be just a stranger. After all, you just came to this because you love me. You love me, don't you?"</p> <p>"I think that you're just making up."</p> <p>"Are you sure? Are you in the mood to be honest and about yourself?"</p> <p>"I guess I am. I haven't made any decisions about what to do."</p> <p>"I'll make one. You're a stranger.
