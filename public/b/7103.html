"I've got to get ready, and we're in here."</p> <p>She nodded, as he turned the lock and turned toward the shower. "Just step in," he said as he shut the door, "You don't need to rush into."</p> <p>They stood, gazing at each other, with no words spoken. There was no rush, no hurry to have sex, no need of foreplay. She put her hands to his face, gently rubbing his stubble-covered chin, and then she leaned down and kissed him softly, tasting the sweetness of herself on his tongue. She could feel his excitement through his jeans, and knew that she could feel his hardness against her thigh. It was hard to not let him put his hands behind her neck. There was nothing she wouldn't do for him, and it was clear she wouldn't disappoint him.</p> <p>She broke the kiss just long enough to say in a soft, breathy tone, "So, that's the problem, huh?" As she was looking into his eyes, she could sense that she had him all the way aroused.</p> <p>"Well, it is," he responded, and then he kissed her hard, exploring and possessing her mouth with his tongue as if it was an appendage.</p> <p>She felt a surge through her whole body as he kissed her, and her hands were at his waist, sliding downward over the leather of his pants with a slow rhythm that made him breathlessly moan. When she reached her breasts, he drew her top up, making the top fall to the side of her chest, and while letting his fingers roam up her ribs, his fingertips caressed her nipples. "Mmmmmm," she sighed, "I guess I'd better get going. Do you want me to wait here or come?"</p> <p>"Do you mean," he said, raising his eyebrows, "the door?"</p> <p>"Sure. Come on in with me." When she turned and left, he turned to see her step into the bathroom. "And don't make any noise," she said as she stepped onto the tile floor. She took his hand, turning to him and kissing him. She wanted him—she had just had the most sexual experience of her entire life with a man. She wanted to feel how hard he was, what he tasted, what he smelled, and—she stopped herself from thinking about the last time she'd had sex because she felt the need that she'd had. She wanted to see him and smell his scent—the scent of her husband, and the aroma of his lovemaking—so she had made the decision.</p> <p>When he entered the shower, she had already begun washing him, so when she began kneading his erection, he let go of her breast and wrapped his arms behind her to hold her from behind. His lips kissed and teased her neck, and his hand roamed over her back and her legs in the darkness. His mouth found her nipples and circled first one and than the other, and after a couple of seconds, she felt herself wanting more than just the attention.</p> <p>His hand began to travel slowly upward, from her nipples to her stomach, slowly tracing and circling her navel as she rubbed her hands in his hair. He dipped his hand inside her panties and pressed her into the tub, then raised his head to kiss her again as he felt her push her hips against him. "Turn around." She did as he said, and was rewarded with his fingers dipping inside her. This time she felt the need as they slipped in and around, and when he turned around her hand found his erection and massaged it with her fingers. He leaned against the shower door as she continued to fondle him with her hand.</p> <p>She turned him away from her as he stepped against the wall and pulled her body close to his. His erection rubbed up against her, and he began to kiss her again, as his mouth moved from her breasts to her neck, to her ear where he teased her the best he could. When he slid his tongue around her earlobe, feeling how warm and soft it was, he moved his mouth across her shoulder toward her ear. With his cock pressed tight against her belly, he whispered in her ear, "Do you want to get me naked so you can take your time?" All he could manage was to moan.</p> <p>She pulled away from him and put her hands on his shoulders. "I don't know," she said. "Not really." She kissed him one last time, and then grabbed his cock and led him out of the shower into the bedroom where they stood side by side, her hands sliding down his body as she spoke. "There's something else you wanted, doesn't there?" She smiled, and leaned against the door, her eyes locked with his—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
