But she isn't?'</p> <p>'No.'</p> <p>'How could you?'</p> <p>I tried to keep moving.</p> <p>'She doesn't want me to be embarrassed. She also said the clothes are to be worn only after an hour of the party. So she won't have to give you a proper explanation.'</p> <p>All the time my back was still turned towards the door.</p> <p>'It looks like you have your shirt untucked. Have a look!'</p> <p>And the door swung open, revealing only the shadow of a man who was wearing black boots, a belt and a black dress shirt lying down on the floor.</p> <p>'I am sorry darling, I should have told you about the dress,' he said, his voice low, his eyes still looking me up and down as if he were sizing me up.</p> <p>'No worries,' he answered.</p> <p>Then he was standing there, staring at me as if in a trance and speaking in hushed tones.</p> <p>'I am sorry to have caught you on such short notice. The party has been a little rough. But I think that we have managed to get some privacy for us,' I thought, pretending to be upset.</p> <p>'No I'm not that upset. All we want is for you to come to work. It won't be a long work with you already out of work and all but I was hoping that there would be less danger,' he answered.</p> <p>By now I was feeling a bit flustered. I couldn't believe that I had thought that all through with the conversation with the stranger that our relationship had been doomed. But I thought how I would answer him if he was right.</p> <p>'OK,' I answered, relieved to finally have some relief. I was glad that I had put the pieces of my mind to the conversation with the stranger as he had done with the girl.</p> <p>'It's good of you to come work for me,' he said, 'And I hope you're not disappointed that I won't be the only one that has found an opportunity.'</p> <p>Now I remembered the conversation that had started with me talking all about my own job which had made me feel better. When he said that he thought that I was going to be one of the top three, I felt myself sinking deeper. I found myself wanting his hand to be inside me and feel his weight. It suddenly hit me that I had been expecting someone who might be more interesting or sophisticated than me, someone that I could enjoy a much more rewarding life, someone whom I would be able to trust to look out for me. I was suddenly frightened about the fact that I now had no job and could be expected to get into a bunch of trouble by the end of the evening, and was therefore terrified of being seen as weak, of being caught in an untidy trap.</p> <p>'I hope that is not all,' he replied, 'Now as soon as I give you some clothes to wear and tell you to take it down to the kitchen please don't let me bother to remove everything.'</p> <p>He closed the door while I picked up my shoes. When I came back out he was lying down in the middle of the kitchen floor. We walked together toward him with my hand over his mouth to keep him silent. He was wearing a black t-shirt which was clinging to his thin muscular frame as my fingers slid over the skin of his chest where his skin could not have been as firm as the rest of him, which I was aware of in a way. His nipples were erect and were sticking straight out in the coolness of the evening air. It was then that I noticed that his hands were gently covering his crotch. I was not shocked that his shorts were wet through, but I was so much too aroused to stop and stare, I reached down and ran a finger along his lips.</p> <p>He was just holding back his erection as he was talking to me and the way that he was moving his hands was exciting me but his tone was so soft and his eyes were so large. He was now looking at me rather than the ground; only a little bit of his hand had already been touching my leg, which made me suddenly feel a little more at ease. His gaze came to me again as he said:</p> <p>'The clothes you found down there should serve your needs tonight,' which, of course was as much a statement as it was a question. But then he did ask me to take it on.</p> <p>'I think I will do that.'</p> <p>As was the habit I had adopted during my career, I was reluctant to take my eyes off his groin and then turn away. I also couldn't let him see through my clothesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
