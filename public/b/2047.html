"Come back to bed with me tomorrow and we can make a full-fledged night of it." He stood, lifted the skirt and began to slip his own panties down his slender legs. It occurred to me that he also had a hard-on that I could still see by the way he moved with every step. In this state, and in a way I could think of, I'm not sure I wanted him to do it, but he did. He slipped his panties off and dropped them on the floor beside his panties. There was so much hair there that the top of his bush appeared to need to be matted down and he had a long bush at the base of his man-hood that he was careful to keep well trimmed because that part of his body was usually a little on the feminine side.</p> <p>In that state all he needed was a hairbrush handle and would have been able to make me come by stroking himself all night long. It was very erotic.</p> <p>We got into bed and he gave me a real long kiss as we lay side by side.</p> <p>"That was very nice, my darling, but I'm afraid I'll find it hard to come again. Maybe someday I'll just need to get used to having a good lover. And maybe you would get to have some wonderful sex, would you have enough for one night but not enough to give you the release you deserve?"</p> <p>"You have nothing to worry about, Steve. There is nothing wrong with having a good lover. We all had the pleasure of having sex, and we are happy for you. This might be our opportunity to make that a regular event. After all, we all do it once in a while, right?"</p> <p>As he said that, I could feel a little bit of his erection and I felt it, indeed. His hand stroked my thigh, just above my vagina. I parted my legs slightly and felt him move his hips from side to side. "You're right," I muttered, as my hand caressed his leg and his hand felt just a bit higher on my knee.</p> <p>A big grin spread on my face as my hand touched again him. It felt like it was coming down a long way.</p> <p>"How would you like to have sex with me tonight?" he murmured. "I'll be there watching."</p> <p>I didn't answer him. I wanted to kiss him again. I wasn't sure if he would. I was just being affectionate.</p> <p>"That felt nice," he groaned. "But let's continue tomorrow night. We can talk more. It depends on if you're still up for it tomorrow. OK?"</p> <p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p> <p>"I mean I'm going to be able to watch you have sex with another man. And, I'll be there at dinner." Then as a surprise, I said, "You know, I was hoping we could go there tomorrow night and we can have our own little 'fuck-party' in the hot tub."</p> <p>That seemed like a good idea. We had a real party. And it was just the two of us? Was that all it was? Could one man make love to another if he was so horny? It seemed a little crazy, but it's how you make your decisions!</p> <p>I turned toward him and kissed his lips. He responded, but I could feel his penis begin to harden as we kissed. I wasn't sure how to proceed, but we went over the idea of a fucking as we didn't seem to have the answers. It was like going to the 'Gift Shop', which I knew he liked.</p> <p>Then I felt his hand slide higher in my panties. I parted my legs to give him access to my sex. He began to fondle me; gently at first, but much more quickly. His penis was growing inside me like my hand had earlier in the day. I started to hump against his hand as he rubbed around inside me on occasion.</p> <p>"Oh, Steve," I sighed, "We can't do this with your cock inside me. You're a long time friend. It can't feel that good. It'll hurt. And it can't put you off for long." I reached down as he removed his hand from inside my skirt and pressed it against my vagina.</p> <p>"I know," he said. "We can't do this. God, I'm such a bastard."</p> <p>"You're right, Steve. I'm just not ready for that yet," I agreed. My vagina felt swollen and it must have been really swollen because it was feeling a little loose. I wasn't ready for it, but I wasn't sure that I wanted to let myself be used.</p> <p>Steve began to kiss me once in a while, then he stopped and we began to kiss in earnest.
