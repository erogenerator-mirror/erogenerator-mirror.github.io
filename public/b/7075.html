You have your chance to be married again and if you can't be with me, then we wouldn't be living together." Sarah looked up at me. "And that was the most important thing, wasn't it? To make sure you were my wife, to make sure it was okay for us to be friends?"</p> <p>I nodded and kissed her. "Of course, I'm still your husband and I'm happy to have you and to share our life with you, even if you'll never get to be her."</p> <p>Sarah's smile broadened. "Good, I love you like that. It was good at the beginning but this doesn't make any sense."</p> <p>I reached over and hugged her. "I hope I'm not in the same boat as you. I won't be able to be her and all I think is where I want to be."</p> <p>"It's okay. It's not like we're going to move back to Chicago like we did."</p> <p>"I just wish you wouldn't feel like you're a one woman man."</p> <p>"I won't. I'm not gay and I love our group too much to lose my own marriage."</p> <p>Sarah looked at me and smiled. "You make me feel good. What could this be, someone else who needs a strong strong spouse to be their best friend?"</p> <p>"We need to be open with each other until we decide if we want to separate or how and when, then I guess it'll just be a matter of when we get back to here."</p> <p>"That's easy. And you?" She grinned.</p> <p>"You make me feel so much better."</p> <p>We hugged and kissed as Sarah fell asleep in my arms.</p> <p>*******</p> <p>I was sitting on the edge of my bed, looking at my phone when I heard the doorbell ring. I jumped up and ran to the open door to answer it.</p> <p>"Come in," a voice called from behind just as I was opening the door. I froze as I was caught by surprise. "What are you doing here?" Sarah asked and laughed. "You aren't supposed to answer that door aren't you?"</p> <p>"You didn't answer your door, I'm sorry I forgot to do that. I'm sorry it has never happened."</p> <p>"That's okay. I was just wondering if you still needed help."</p> <p>"Yeah well it wasn't too much and I'm really not surprised. You were pretty busy. I'd just as soon let you go as anyone else."</p> <p>"I'm not going to miss any of your company. I was actually happy to see you. So glad you're still here with us. Are you still coming?" Sarah asked as she moved her arms to hug me from behind.</p> <p>I turned my head this way and that. "I'm still in a big rush now. I thought I was going to make something of it."</p> <p>Sarah wrapped me in her arms and leaned over to kiss me. "But you're already here right? You shouldn't be sitting here."</p> <p>"Nope, I just wanted to talk to you about the proposal you have. It's been on my mind a lot lately."</p> <p>"Really? I thought we agreed we'd have them move right next to us until we got back from the wedding."</p> <p>"As soon as we get back the wedding will start, we'll be in full-scale planning and I want a clear head and clear eye for how it's going to be with the team. That means a couple days just talking and catching up. Then there's the wedding and maybe a couple of nights of rehearsal to get us ready and then after that we'll be in full time."</p> <p>"What are you up too?" When Sarah broke through the kiss, she looked up at me.</p> <p>"You know what I mean Sarah."</p> <p>"I'm going to be with Michael. You might even want to make that call now in advance."</p> <p>"I'll ask the next time and let you know, then, okay?"</p> <p>Sarah looked at me, then to the bedroom door. "Let's go on down to tell you about the meeting I've been having with John, then you can make a decision." She gave me a kiss and then turned towards the bedroom door.</p> <p>I followed her down the stairs, then followed her into the kitchen. After a quick talk with the two cooks, we had the rest of the meal prepared before leaving.</p> <p>When I finally spoke, Sarah stood beside me. "So what's this about your decision not to come back to Chicago. I'm not going to do anything to ruin your marriage but can you get it back on solid ground?"</p> <p>I smiledâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
