His name was Mark as he had called out to me this morning. He seemed to get off on being watched as much as I do.</p> <p>We were on our first day of camp for the day and he had a couple games going for him then he got a beer and sat across from me. He asked me to sit down. He had just walked over toward me and sat in my lap and put his beer on my crotch. He was just looking me in the eyes that I couldn’t miss. Barry was always very self-conscious of my penis because he had never done anything like this. It had been very obvious that he would think that a normal penis was very small when you had a penis so I didn’t think there was anything wrong with it at all when it was hard.</p> <p>I think he had a sort of look of shame or something because his eyes were almost staring at my now fully erect cock but he didn’t look away. When he spoke to me I had to be sure that I didn’t break their eye contact because it seemed to be turning me on even more than it was. I had never thought that such an act was something that guys would go for and think that was all they wanted to do. I had never been turned on as much as I was the night before. It was all that I could do not to stroke myself right then. I found that my excitement grew with this bold and unexpected action.</p> <p>Barry smiled broadly at me and told me that he had gone way over to my house and then he was taking a stroll around and around. It was after I had come with him to where I would be sitting that he had told me that he wanted to see what I had been wearing on that hot day. So I asked him why he wanted to get a look at me. He said that he had already figured it out when I had come over to him to talk to him. I thought that he must have seen the way that I was sitting. I also wondered if he knew that I was only watching him. I felt very awkward but it didn’t bother me because I knew that it would only be a matter of time before he would have my big man-stirring cock for himself.</p> <p>Barry looked at me and said he could see the way that I was looking at him. I was in no condition to have my cock, especially my head, or face. I wasn’t sure if Barry saw how my head was hiding and I started thinking about how I was just too nervous and embarrassed to ask more because he knew that it wouldn’t take much to make me feel comfortable with the way that I was dressed.</p> <p>As we talked, Barry’s eyes had been looking up and down my shirt all through dinner time. I have to admit that it occurred to me that I had on a very thin pair of cotton panties and that he had been looking in them too. I really had no idea how good it would look to him. It really didn’t bother me at all. I felt a little better even, if you know where I am going as I have just come to the realization that there was nothing I wouldn’t do to make it worse.</p> <p>Barry was really looking at me. His eyes always seemed to be checking the size of my breasts, although his eyes seemed to get more and more bold with each glance. I think he saw how exposed my panties were and he just smiled a lot and seemed to be enjoying himself as he just stared at me. His expression didn’t change as I sat and drank my beer that I had been taking in several bottles before I had sat down. He seemed to be enjoying his drinking. The one thing that I really didn’t want to do right then was to actually do anything. There was no reason that I should do something that I think that I was really uncomfortable about. I was feeling a little weird about the way it was happening.</p> <p>We finished the meal a few minutes apart and as we started to leave I noticed that Barry’s right arm was sort of moving from his beer gut to and then, as he was looking back at me, he was looking down my shirt. It was almost as if he was looking me up and down as he looked a bit down at my crotch. I could feel my heart beat in my throat. I started thinking of things to say.</p> <p>“You know I am going to have to think about what I want to do tomorrow. This whole thing seems crazy to me.”</p> <p>Barry kept looking up at me the whole way back to the front of the bar. I could tell that he was thinking about what I might make him do. He just nodded his head.</p> <p>After the drinks were all gone—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
