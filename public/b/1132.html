Did I say wrong?" he asked her again.</p> <p>Keri could see in his eyes that he wasn't upset with her, but it did the trick to calm the situation down. "I'm scared," she said as she moved to give him space to stand up and let go of the table in that awkward hug.</p> <p>John had expected more of that than that. He was just glad she wanted to hear his concerns and didn't want to put her in the awkward position of having to lie.</p> <p>"Are you sure? We never had that conversation in high school," John said with a shrug.</p> <p>"No, I'm sure; it would be much more comfortable if you showed me what you had left to have with her," she said with a grin. "I think it will be fun."</p> <p>"No, I mean we can't do it here; we'll have to see where to get supplies out," he replied, trying to keep all the tension going.</p> <p>Keri sighed heavily. "But after tonight," she mumbled. "What do you mean?" John wanted to know.</p> <p>"Well," she said, looking him over with a bit more resolve. "It sounds strange, but I think it will be fun to have a relationship with you... you know... with my body."</p> <p>"Do you really think so?" he asked. "I thought you were going to say that you wanted your body fucked," he said with a grin.</p> <p>Keri just gave him a look. "You never said anything about that," she replied with a laugh, "it just seemed... right," she said then turned to walk back to the bathroom as he continued to watch her ass, pulling her skirt up a bit, exposing both of her ass cheeks to him.</p> <p>He watched her cute little shapely derrière as Keri began to do one of the things he'd loved to see when she was younger and enjoyed making out with her. The sight of her gorgeous ass always kept him hard, even after he fucked her a few weeks ago. A slight smile flashed across his face, knowing she could use that. He leaned back against the table and leaned into her and leaned back against her. He had always wondered if he could get through the night before he came home, but in his current state of mind he didn't care. In fact, it made him feel good that she felt the same way.</p> <p>"Would you like me to kiss and suck on your..." He tried to ask and couldn't stop himself.</p> <p>Keri interrupted him. "Fuck off!" she said as she walked away from his table. "I've had my chance, and I don't want you leaving yet," she said as she made her way out.</p> <p>John had no choice but to follow her. Keri had a way of looking like the proverbial cat that got the cream without having a chance to purr or cry or even mutter the sex name, and he knew that if she continued in her state of mind it would be impossible to keep up with her.</p> <p>Their trip to the motel had been quiet; after a day of watching each other in the mirror, John was more than a little distracted from the beautiful girl, but now, it was like he couldn't get enough of her. They hadn't kissed or shown more than they had the first time they made out, but she was a different kind of girl. She wasn't the type to just blow a kiss, but she was a different kind of girl to get off on.</p> <p>John turned to look at the mirror as he was walking out of the building, but his mind was busy with sex and memories of Keri. He was happy that she would have a little fun tonight, and even if he didn't, it could be a good time for her because this afternoon he was getting her to think a little differently about her sex life and her love life. John felt an odd stirring in his loins, reminding him of what he had to do.</p> <p>Keri parked in her room and John leaned back against the door that led off to her right. He closed his legs and leaned back on a bench and held his head.</p> <p>"So, do you still want to stay married to my mom?" she asked, as she sat down on the bench.</p> <p>"Yes," he replied somewhat nervously as he felt his cock beginning to get hard again.</p> <p>Keri took a deep breath and her eyes were wet and lusty. She reached over and took him in her left hand. "I don't think it's a good idea," she said with a smile. —</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
