I said and turned to head for the toilet, feeling very relieved. I didn't feel in control of my own thoughts anymore. Just before I entered the room I glanced into my bathroom and was surprised to see that my father had no clothes on. He was just sitting on the toilet with his legs crossed over the other side.</p> <p>"Ah, I'm sorry! No, I don't mean to, but I'm a little anxious about being late in the morning." I smiled at him trying to make light of the situation. He sat there for several minutes before looking away and finally saying, "It's just that..." and his breathing was heavy. His gaze never left the toilet. He finally looked away as I stood again then made eye contact. He was on his way to the sink and I followed him to the sinks, standing there for a very long time. By the time I stood him from behind he was walking towards me and when he stopped about three feet from me and looked up at me I had the strongest feeling I had had in a very, very, very long time. I knew he was about to kiss me; I knew he liked to kiss me right in broad daylight under the shower in this state. And I knew he wanted to kiss me right then too.</p> <p>Still wearing my night gown, I placed my right hand on his shoulders and gently pushed him away. I didn't say a word of thanks. It wasn't really that I wanted a boyfriend so much it didn't even cross my mind. Instead of standing there any longer I let go of his shoulders and slowly walked towards the bathroom and then closed the door. I made sure I locked it before returning to my bedroom.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I haven't called the cops for your father! I can't..." I began but no words came out of my mouth. I had already gone a lot further than I expected but never really expected it to become so soon.</p> <p>"Oh, no, it's very okay, I... uh..." I began again and when I couldn't find the words I turned to get out of my room. I turned back and found him leaning against the door frame. He looked up at me and smiled, saying, "I'm going to call the cops on you."</p> <p>"I don't want that." I replied, surprised. He was probably right but what did I care? He didn't know how long they'd stay and probably wouldn't talk for a long time but that was something I couldn't give him.</p> <p>"Good! Then get dressed and meet me in the living room so that I can put this into the washing machine." I laughed and grabbed a box of tampons and some towels.</p> <p>As he walked out and walked to the wash machine I quickly ran to the bathroom. Just as I was stepping in I heard a noise coming from inside. It wasn't the washing machine. Oh dear, a lot of things were wrong, but at this point I couldn't help thinking that I'd have to call the cops before he could get himself off the soap factory, not that I wasn't already on that list of things I must do, but now, it was a real possibility. Still, this was one of those things I wanted to try, that wasn't to mention the fact that it just wouldn't happen. I'd already considered just leaving him to bed but I didn't want another step on the wrong foot by going in alone. So I got into the bathtub and just stayed there.</p> <p>The wash was not really as warm as I expected but it was better than I expected. I thought about trying to go back and just watch the TV but then decided that would be too awkward to go back to. I took the soap that he'd given me and washed it down again. This time I just sat in the tub until I was sure I got the wash right then stepped out. Walking into the living room he came out with several towels in his hands. "Here, clean up that bit of dust on you." He said as he handed each towel and the clean ones.</p> <p>"Thank you." I said and stood up. He watched me again and told me to turn around. I slowly began to turn and he handed me the towel but not before saying "Don't get it wet now."</p> <p>"Okay, we'd better get into the bedroom."</p> <p>"Yes," I replied as we were stepping into my bedroom door and then closing the door again. "I have that thing all cleaned out and I think we can't keep this here too long." I thought.</p> <p>"Well..." He didn't wait for any words as he opened my door and stepped into my room. I stepped back and closed the door and turned around to face him. He smiled and said, "I don't have any more questions as long as, you don't want to do it yourself."</p> <p>"Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
