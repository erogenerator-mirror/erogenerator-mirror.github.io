I looked at Alex and thought before I could go any further "I don't know, where do you live."</p> <p>"The house is only a few blocks down, maybe you can drive a bit and stop at the corner and get it done. Now get it done if you can. Then come and pick it up tomorrow if you can. You can give it to the neighbor and I can do with it as I please."</p> <p>I couldn't believe I had just agreed to be able to do this. If Alex was going to help me like this, why the hell was I even going along with it? I didn't think it was worth it. I mean, I could have at least thought about it a bit as I didn't really want Alex picking up on this as I usually did, but I didn't think it would be an issue.</p> <p>I walked over to the car and made sure all of the windows were shut before I opened the door and got the car started. I pulled out of the driveway and started it up, got out of the driveway and started it up again just as the radio began to play. I grabbed out a bottle of Coke and went to the back seat and got a glass to take with me out into the cool night air. I climbed in and as I started it up again, I looked around and couldn't believe how quiet the house had become.</p> <p>I turned to the front and just as I looked at the house, Alex came out and got in the back and pulled me to my feet. She started to kiss me while squeezing my breast as she whispered into my ear "You are absolutely the most beautiful thing I have ever seen, my own sweet angel."</p> <p>I blushed at how good she sounded as she pushed me back against a wall as she looked at me with those deep brown eyes that always made me feel so special. I'm a sucker for a dirty blond that loves to make love, and I loved every second of it as I started to feel her hands explore my body once again as she leaned into the kiss.</p> <p>I kissed her back as I started to gently rub my hands across her back and down to her buttocks. I cupped both of them and pulled them against me as I slid one of my fingers inside of her pussy and began to kiss up her neck as I continued to knead her cheeks. This time I was getting her completely undressed and while feeling her breasts, I realized I was actually in for a treat. No man was going to be able to resist feeling this all of the time.</p> <p>I felt the bulge in her panties as I gently rubbed and gently pinched her right nipple between my index finger and thumb. I then reached down to her panties and as I felt how wet she was becoming, I pulled them off and began to massage her mound with my hand again before returning my head to kiss her neck as I continued to explore her. I slid her panties down as I continued to rub and probe with my tongue as she pulled down my shirt and kissed my chest.</p> <p>That was all I had to go on as she reached around behind me and started to rub her hands through my hair. She pulled my shirt off and before I knew it, I was sitting there just wearing a pair of lace black lace French cut pantyhose. I felt like I wasn't going to be able to hold out for long as her hands began to explore me more and more, moving higher to rub down my stomach and lightly stroke my clit as her other hand found my breast and squeezed gently.</p> <p>Alex broke our embrace at the kiss, turned around and lifted me up as her lips and tongue went back into my mouth as she pulled me back to the couch and threw me down on it. As she did this, I felt her pussy right above my head just as she began to grind her clit against my lips. I moaned out loud as her tongue went deep into my mouth as her body shook against me and her pussy began to twitch and pulsate against my tongue as her orgasm swept over her. ***</p> <p>"You have no idea how much this is going to feel like this." Alex said smiling as she looked me over and then stood up as if she hadn't finished her sentence, "Let's go."</p> <p>She opened the back door and got out but left all of our supplies and things on the other couch. She laid back down and spread her legs apart as she told me to continue kissing from her neck down to her pussy. I quickly got between her legs and once again started to lick her up quickly as her body went into spasms. I looked up at Alexâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
