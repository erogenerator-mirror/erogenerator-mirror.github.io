Maybe if my mind had made me think the other morning I would be on my feet and then I could be going home.</p> <p>And anyway, it wasn't as if I was in any hurry; it wasn't that I really could get away without giving up the right to go.</p> <p>Of course it was hard, having a job as a teacher.</p> <p>I just did my job and found that getting into the classrooms was difficult. I only got one class and that had me in an uproar.</p> <p>I didn't even bother to ask for an extension from my grade or go to one of my other class. I just used it to get in behind me.</p> <p>I was always a class clown and that never helped but I felt like I could have just been doing my best to keep up. Even the bell was my little joy. When I left school I gave a good show even though my grades barely showed it.</p> <p>And when I got to my school the first day I was there I saw a note taped to the door. It was the same one that someone gave me a year ago. So of course, I took it.</p> <p>It said "See you tomorrow, Jack." I wasn't interested in how it looked or that it meant anything to me.</p> <p>At least I wasn't expected to see it.</p> <p>I was sure that once I pulled out of school and pulled my car in and did that I would never see it again and it would be as plain as day after day. I had no real desire to do it now.</p> <p>I had no other choice, I just let myself in when I didn't want to. I'd gotten an invite to a party with a band and the next day they were going to do another number with a live band in attendance.</p> <p>I didn't really want to do this, I just wanted to. I guess after the fact of the day that kind of thing didn't really add up now.</p> <p>I pulled off the hood of my car and walked over to a spot where I knew I would probably never see it again, even if I wanted to, and waited for my chance.</p> <p>I'd always been a pretty good student. We'd finished high school together, I had a job but for work I was paid minimum wage. The job was boring but I thought about it and about the people who were going to be working there and all of my friends.</p> <p>I had always said that there are some things that are boring. I didn't mean it, but there wasn't anything that I would ever do that that I really didn't want to do anyway. I mean, I've never been a bad person and I'd like to say that my life isn't a lot of fun, I know, but a lot of the time I really just want to be happy.</p> <p>Then the day my life changed.</p> <p>I got a call from a friend of mine that he was going to be at "the party," he said it was kind of a big venue for their party. I thought about not going, but it seemed like a good place to do business.</p> <p>That's when I picked up the phone and there were going to be about 20 people there. The band was going to sing and there were going to be songs on it and some of the songs. That was an unusual thing for a local band that I hadn't heard before.</p> <p>It was all going to be kind of boring, a bit of heavy metal and some other stuff and I had never been to this particular party before. I told myself that if something really weird happened, I could just go along and enjoy myself.</p> <p>But I just figured I might as well go.</p> <p>I got the bus and set off for the party. It was about an hour since I'd left my cell phone and I guess I was glad I had it back because it was pretty silent. I didn't really care because I had another number.</p> <p>I got to the party quickly, there was a guy at the front desk and I found it in that order.</p> <p>The lights started going off and I waited till the other students went back to their classes then I got a drink and waited for about 5 minutes. Then I saw some of my friends there and I guess I saw a bunch of guys coming and going. I took my phone out and put on the headphones and was about an hour into the party when I heard myself say, "Here it is, here it is."</p> <p>And I did all right.</p> <p>When I got there I heard some guys that knew each other say that it was a blast. They were really having a good time. When all the other people left they started to take the seats that they were assigned and to make themselvesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
