She looked up, smiling and nodding her head, then left him standing there, her dress around her hips.</p> <p>She moved toward the kitchen and began to clean the dishes. Tom waited outside until he heard her humming and then returned into the living room, sitting down at the table as the dishes were being washed and straightening out the kitchen, then sitting down and beginning to eat his meal.</p> <p>"So, you're not planning to stay in for the rest of the summer," he began. "I didn't mean to be so presumptuous."</p> <p>She shook her head, "It wasn't the end of the world, it was simply that you had to move back, so I was in no position to support you. Besides, as I was just telling you, it's in the name of the family."</p> <p>"You didn't know?"</p> <p>"No," she chuckled.</p> <p>"Yes, I do."</p> <p>"I can't help but notice," she replied, "that you are a bit more muscular than I have remembered from the gym," and she began to eat her breakfast.</p> <p>"Good!" he smiled and continued to eat. "You know better than that, that you could probably handle your father in very little fashion at all. If you wanted to fight the urge to hit him at the gym, that would also be a good option."</p> <p>Marilyn took a mouthful of her cereal; it had taken almost three hours to cook as of yet, and she was feeling kind of sluggish after the workout from the workout. Even though she was only half dressed, she knew that after a few minutes she would be ready to do the same. She decided to get dressed and go down to cook, leaving Tom alone in the kitchen.</p> <p>For several minutes she ate the scrambled eggs and bacon. Then, she got up and began pulling on the dress that she had worn to bed. It was a modest, long skirt, but it was very form fitting, showing off her curves and showing as it went down her thighs and hips. She had worn an abbreviated silk thong underneath her panties, but she did not wear anything else; she could not afford to wear a thong. But she did wear a thin silk gown, with the buttons down the front. She reached back and drew a loose fitting brassiere to her back, her breasts spilling out, and tied the neck in a knot as a bow. The front clasped closed in the back, accenting the swell of her breasts underneath it. It was a short, tight dress that buttoned up the front, just barely hiding her woman parts. Even from the waist up, most of her breasts were exposed, but on her face she wore a look of confidence that was very sexy, and the sight of it only made Tom want to stare. When she bent over at the waist to pull the blouse together, he could clearly see part of her breasts, and he could see that there was very little of her belly to be seen, because of the thin fabric. It was rather a poor thing to wear as well, and even more revealing than the dress. But her body was so sexy and inviting, and he knew that there was little chance of getting angry with her if she kept it in mind tonight. And from the way that she had sat there, he had been able to make out her breasts enough to make him hard, and she was his.</p> <p>Marilyn got through the rest of her meal, which was, of course, a little uncomfortable. But at that point the only thing that was working was for what was probably going to come later this evening, and then Tom said, "So tell me, Tom," as she placed the plate down on his table. "Do you want me to pick up my things?"</p> <p>"No, that's okay; I had been planning a little something special tonight."</p> <p>"What is that?"</p> <p>Tom was trying to be a little boyish, and he was beginning to realize that his face would not be so kind tonight. The fact that this pretty thing in her underwear was asking to pick up her clothes, and he wanted to give her a little gift at the expense of being with someone who was in the business, was getting on his nerves.</p> <p>But Marilyn didn't say anything; she just leaned back in her chair and looked at him expectantly.</p> <p>Tom decided to play along. "You were wearing a teddy tonight. And you have beautiful breasts."</p> <p>Marilyn blushed a little, and then said, "Your compliments are kind."</p> <p>Tom was somewhat surprised, and he had to give her a hard time. But again, he was not going to say anything now. He finished off his meal, took her plate to the dishwasher and loaded the trash. Then he left while he finished loading the dirty dishes and putâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
