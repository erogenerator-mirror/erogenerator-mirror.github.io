Yes! Yes! Yes!"</p> <p>She reached up and took hold of my breasts again, and it was the most wonderful thing I'd ever felt. She caressed them, rolled my nipples between her fingers and pulled on them gently as the orgasm swept over me and she kept grinding against my body, her hips moving in slow thrusts.</p> <p>Again my own explosion was there. Her body shivered and she held me close once more. Our lips were so close to each other now and our breathing was harsh together. I could feel my own cum welling up in my belly.</p> <p>I felt she was still lying next to me but her body was still shaking. I could feel my juices on her face and stomach. Our breaths were raggedly and I could feel something wet on my face. Oh, I was so wet. I turned to her and her eyes were closed in sheer bliss.</p> <p>After a moment she opened them and there were tears in her eyes.</p> <p>"Oh, my! It was so nice. The best ever! Oh, David, you were so wonderful. That was so nice."</p> <p>I felt embarrassed with the way I had so quickly brought my first lover to such intense orgasms, which for a moment had been a bit silly to try to get her back from her first.</p> <p>I said a little prayer and then went to get some paper towels from the bathroom and I made ready for the next session. I was washing my face when I heard her soft moans and when the woman in the white robe came back into the room she saw me smiling, not really sure that I was going to take my shower. She took my hand and ran me past her chair.</p> <p>The robe was soaked, which was not difficult in the water, and she sat down beside me. The first hand was so exciting to touch my lover. She moved her robe aside and there was my first naked body. I couldn't take my eyes off of her, and then I looked into her eyes. My face was still shiny with sweat and my mouth was open and I could feel her nipples hard against me.</p> <p>She was still smiling at me.</p> <p>"I've been looking forward to this for a while. You look so beautiful! You really make me that way. It feels so good! I don't know what makes me go down on you. It makes me hot as well."</p> <p>She said, "Oh, David, it's like that for both of us. You make me so feel so good! You make me feel so comfortable. I love you. I love you."</p> <p>"Oh, I love you. I really love you. I can't help myself."</p> <p>"That makes you hot, David. You're so sweet."</p> <p>She took a deep breath and said, "I don't know when I was, like, ready to do this."</p> <p>"We have already had a lot of experience, that's for sure."</p> <p>"Oh, I knew. I knew. I want this so much. I want to show you how much!"</p> <p>She hugged me. My hands were not in a hurry to move up to her breasts.</p> <p>After we cleaned each other and dried each other off we got dressed, and I kissed her and said, "Thank you. I'll keep you company. I love you."</p> <p>"I love you too, David."</p> <p>The session wound up with the two woman in the white robes getting married. The wedding was being in a church on Monday, so it was quite a surprise to find myself walking in the lobby that evening. As my mother walked in she saw the same two of us, not the two men from the receptioning the first time. She gave me a hug and said, "Hello, I'm Sarah, one of the wives of David."</p> <p>"Hi, Sarah. I'm David. I don't remember you being married before."</p> <p>"Yes I've been married to David for many years. I just moved here to work."</p> <p>The two women exchanged smiles and then Sarah said, "Please sit down, I'm starving."</p> <p>"Sarah, I'm not sure where to start. I've got this afternoon."</p> <p>Sarah smiled and said, "Please come to my office and I'll tell you about it."</p> <p>After she had a moment to compose herself, I said, "I could get it out of you if you wanted me to."</p> <p>Sarah took the hand she had used on her robe and put it on her belly. Now I couldn't reach it from my hand but I did feel how the robe was so wet.</p> <p>"Here, let me take this off, please."</p> <p>She went to the desk and came back with a small towel. She helped me dry off and then said she would tell me more in the morningâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
