He admitted, "I'm going to go home and get some rest so I can work on my other projects."</p> <p>Diane thought to herself, "I'll try and keep him in the mood when he comes home later then tonight and I can always give him an extra orgasm. If he even cums just so happens to be home, we can make up for what we missed in the past."</p> <p>Kathy looked at her cell phone. "Kinda hard to believe this isn't just the regular thing. He has been like that with me in the future."</p> <p>Kathy laughed at herself. "I know, but it's too late now."</p> <p>"Oh, I know. As long as he gets to spend time with his friends I'm willing to stay and do whatever makes him happy. In a little while I'm going to take a quick nap and try to get him out of my system. I'll see you Friday night."</p> <p>"Ok."</p> <p>Diane and Kathy had gotten home an hour or so ago and they had both stripped and laid beside the couch. Kathy's eyes were closed, so Diane pulled the cover over them. Then Diane slid up to Kathy's bed and pulled the covers down.</p> <p>Diane's fingers played in her pussy and she slipped her fingers into Kathy's pussy as she lay next her. She was in heaven when she could feel Kathy slowly climax. After a few minutes she felt Kathy's legs clamp tightly against her, her legs shaking on either side of her. Diane smiled, "Kathy, I've missed you so much."</p> <p>Kathy smiled and started to push up off the bed. "I'm sorry." She groaned.</p> <p>Diane pushed her fingers all the way into Kathy's pussy, but kept a firm grip on her. "You're a good patient." Diane whispered.</p> <p>"I'm ok." Kathy said. "I've only been in here for two hours and I'm really close to coming. I had just gotten on the edge of coming just watching you."</p> <p>"I know that." Diane smiled, "You are a very sexy female."</p> <p>"Thank you. Kathy, I'm still trying to get over the shock of seeing you. If you want to join me for a dip in the pool I'm not going anywhere near my room and you are free to go whenever you want." Diane smiled.</p> <p>"Thanks. I'll get changed as soon as I can. I need to get cleaned up."</p> <p>"Why don't you go change and come back in two days?" Diane asked.</p> <p>"You have time to come by if you want." Kathy looked at her quizzically.</p> <p>"I'll come." Diane said with a giggle.</p> <p>"I've got another problem. I need to get some sleep." Kathy said. "Diane, I've had an idea where I'd like to stick and I can just get a hotel room while you're in the pool."</p> <p>"I'll walk you over. Kathy, I'd like to say bye and talk over some coffee if you want," Diane said, "and then I'll stop by a little later, OK?"</p> <p>"Ok, thanks for the suggestion."</p> <p>Kathy got dressed and was out the door at the right pace with her heart in her mouth. She left no doubt when she opened the gate that she and Diane were leaving.</p> <p>Part 13:</p> <p>Kathy drove home and headed for the pool. She had been thinking of having a morning orgasm when Diane had walked into her house. She was already in bed. She was just sitting in bed waiting for Diane to come over.</p> <p>She heard the door open. Her heart raced. What could she expect from Diane? She had told her how she liked to have her pussy licked and had asked Diane to keep it clean for her.</p> <p>Kathy stood naked before the door. She had wanted to leave a message she had given Diane so she didn't feel she had to go in. Instead she just had to decide if she was going to fuck this guy she had been dating for the past two months. The choice was hers and she had to make it as plain as possible.</p> <p>Diane opened the door and stepped in to the room. Kathy walked over and sat on the end of the bed.</p> <p>"I'm sorry." She said.</p> <p>"Don't be." Diane turned around and bent at the waist to pick up Kathy's clothes from the floor. "Kathy, you're not going to get in my way."</p> <p>"No, I'll come back." Kathy said, "Just get in here and let me make the bed."</p> <p>"No, get in here before I go out there."
