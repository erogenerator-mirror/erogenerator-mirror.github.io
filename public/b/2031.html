The last thing in the world was so different. We couldn't do anything we could never do for anyone else.</p> <p>He took hold of me, and we lay together in each other's arms, with the room smelling of sweat and sexual excitement, his penis still half inside my butt and my body still half-erect, and not much more at all.</p> <p>We kissed and cuddled, as if we were each other's children, and we explored each other's body, sucking, caressing, and stroking, as we continued this most intimate of encounters.</p> <p>He finally pulled back, and I slid to the side, pulling off my nightgown over my head.</p> <p>"We can do this," I said, smiling "I can't get enough of you."</p> <p>He crawled between my legs, and I wrapped them around his body, as if to lock him in, to feel him inside me, and to feel his sperm in me.</p> <p>He fucked me so hard and so long that I could feel it in my toes.
