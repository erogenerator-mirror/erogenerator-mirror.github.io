He felt like he was on horseback, trying to keep pace. He felt like he could fly off the edge. He was aware that he could feel his entire body going stiff and stiff. He was so tense, so tense he didn't even know he was there. He needed to calm down or he was going to lose it in exhaustion. But as much as he didn't know what that was, he knew it had been a great start to his sex life. He could feel his face start to sweat and he looked like he was wearing sweat pants. He still couldn't believe he had just had an orgasm. It had been so good, just so good.</p> <p>His body convulsed and spasmed again as he went off to heaven. This time as he let go, he was a different person. He was completely out of control... just as he'd always thought he'd be.</p> <p>"Uhhhhhhh, you were great!" He sighed.</p> <p>His arms around his chest were still feeling shaky from the exertion, but he was smiling, remembering how he'd made love to his new girlfriend. Just as he was about to tell his new girlfriend, she stood and walked over to him. He felt something wet on his face, and he looked up at her with alarm. The last thing he remembered was that he had pulled a pillow over his head.</p> <p>She took a couple steps back and said, "Don't fight it, Mark. I didn't really mean to do that."</p> <p>Mark was still kind of mad at himself for feeling like he was having sex the way he had. He'd never considered having sex with his girlfriend before, and here was his girlfriend asking for some action instead. He didn't know if he was angry about it at all, but it felt like he was.</p> <p>She leaned in closer and said, "I couldn't have felt it before myself, but don't worry about it. After you told me about you and your friend, I thought I'd try and make up for having sex with you in the first place."</p> <p>Her voice was soft, warm and friendly and Mark was overwhelmed with emotion. He was beginning to get a little annoyed that she'd started this by having sexual relations with him. He hadn't wanted things to end this way anyway. He was about to say, "Well, that was hot, wasn't it?" when he felt an overwhelming sense of relief. He wasn't going to have to admit that much to his new girlfriend, especially now that she'd seen his new-found sexual curiosity. He was going to tell her to go ahead... and then he'd tell her the same thing. He wanted to keep going. He couldn't.</p> <p>"You're not mad over this?" She asked, a smile coming to her face.</p> <p>"No, I guess not, but you're still a little shocked. I'm not going to make it up to you anytime soon, either." He was trying to get it out.</p> <p>She leaned over and kissed Mark on the cheek. "I wouldn't be too upset if you did, but I think you need to tell me the truth. You're still too shy, and you can't always find yourself in the mood, especially if you're feeling good... I know, right?"</p> <p>Mark was feeling too weak to argue. He still felt like he needed to tell her about the night he'd gone back to her apartment after they'd had a few glasses of wine. But he also didn't know how he was going to do it in order to get the answer he wanted. He wasn't sure he wanted to tell her so hard but he wasn't sure how, or who, would let him know what else they might do... he just knew that if he told her she'd love it all.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'd really like to. I've got to get to the office early. Why don't we go up to your place and talk for a few minutes, and then we can have dinner together?"</p> <p>"Okay. I'll just go shower. I'll meet you in your office in my suite at lunch time."</p> <p>*****</p> <p>He'd been walking with a very nervous energy as he came back from the elevator, knowing that he was probably going to be very uncomfortable in the morning, if not at the desk where his new desk was. He'd only known him a couple of days, and to give him time, it seemed he was going to be here for another few weeks. He'd even made him a glass of white wine and some coffee in honor of his new girlfriend, and he'd told her she'd really come around, that he was really great at sex, so much more so than she was. The words had really sunk in for him when he'd mentioned that she was just so hot and she was probably aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
