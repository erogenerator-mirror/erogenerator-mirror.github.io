The things I thought about about you, you know. And the things I never thought I'd be able to do as well."</p> <p>"That's sweet." When I saw a smile, I was relieved.</p> <p>I leaned over onto the bed, and she kissed me. Her hands slid against my body, massaging the muscles that had worked so hard over the last couple months that it seemed in their wake. I reached my hands down her back and felt for her ass. She broke the kiss, and looked up at me. She ran her finger down my cheek, and she grabbed my cock with her hand. This time I was not to be denied, and I slid my cock into her. Her cunt was just perfect. My cock split her open. I could feel every inch of her body as it embraced my thickness. She let out an odd shriek at the invasion of her body. She reached back, grabbed a hold of the backs of my thighs, and pushed back. We were both working our way towards heaven. Our bodies were now in a rhythm of motion.</p> <p>"Are you ready to fuck me, Brian?" Her question almost surprised me. Not one part of me was ready to admit.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Do it in me. I want you inside of me."</p> <p>I had my answer, and I was so turned on I needed to fuck her now. I slid my cock completely out of her pussy, and grabbed her hips. I grabbed her ass, and thrust into her hard, causing her to moan. She pushed back into me, as she felt me filling her. I began to move again, hard and fast, and she pushed back harder. As we were both approaching a climax, I grabbed her ass again, and slammed into her hard one last time. I could feel myself erupting as I felt the contractions deep in her cunt. My cock pulsed inside her, filling her with semen into her womb.</p> <p>I fell on her, and we kissed. I kissed her neck, and pulled her ass back, sliding my cock into her pussy. We kissed each other for a while, and then we rolled onto our sides and cuddled, both coming down from our intense orgasms. We were both in a haze, and I knew it was time to go back into town.</p> <p>"When I was fucking you on the hood, that was what we were talking about. Was you thinking about me again, Brian?" she said.</p> <p>"That's a big step for you, to ask that kind of question." I replied.</p> <p>"I need to see it again."</p> <p>I got out of bed, and went down the hallway. I heard a door open, and I went to a window that led into the back of the house. I peeked out, and saw a man in his forties. He was holding up his hand and looked at the house.</p> <p>"Where is he?"</p> <p>"There's a man in the room. He was looking through the window, checking out the house. He's still in and in there, but he's taking a picture."</p> <p>"And what is he taking?"</p> <p>"I don't know. He must have seen us fucking, but he didn't say anything, and he was busy putting a picture of us. When I got home, I thought that it was okay to let him take my picture if he wanted to, but he's not showing."</p> <p>"Did he say that you and I were lovers?"</p> <p>"He said that we had some wild nights where he had gotten a blowjob from me. I guess he had to admit that you and I could be having wild, animal sex."</p> <p>I was starting to rethink who the girl was. That was going to be a tough one!</p> <p>"Is he your girlfriend?" I said, looking for some signs that she was not the only girl in the house.</p> <p>"No. I told him that I couldn't get pregnant after a few years of being with my husband. I didn't want to have anything serious to do with him, and it wasn't something our marriage was interested in going forward."</p> <p>"Is that what you want to keep for yourself?"</p> <p>"Yep."</p> <p>"That sounds like a wise decision."</p> <p>"This is a whole new world. I've always known you weren't that kind of guy, but this was an open friendship between us."</p> <p>"I don't want you to think that we were sleeping together before we got married. I just wanted to see if my new found love could work out."</p> <p>"So, would you like to join us for an evening?"</p> <p>"I would love to."</p> <p>We made plans forâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
