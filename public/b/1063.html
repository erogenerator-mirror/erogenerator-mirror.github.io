I don't care," she said.</p> <p>She pulled his hand to her, kissing it gently.</p> <p>"I'm just going to put the lube on and I want to do it fast," he said.</p> <p>"Mmmmm," she said. He smiled at her. "But first we really need to do things."</p> <p>They kissed again, and she got comfortable on her back.</p> <p>He squeezed some of the lube on his middle finger and used it to push inside her. Her ass opened for him, and he felt her muscles tighten a little.</p> <p>"That's a start," he said.</p> <p>He pushed his finger deeper into her, and she moaned.</p> <p>He continued working two fingers into her ass. He put his fingers in the palm of his left hand, and worked them in and out of her, his right hand keeping pace as he fucked both her ass and pussy.</p> <p>He worked the two fingers deeper with each thrust of hers, and they pushed together. He felt her hand touch his, and he looked into her eyes as he pushed them all the way inside of her. His eyes widened when he saw the look on her face, and there was nothing shy in being taken.</p> <p>"Fuck my ass," she said.</p> <p>"Oh, no." He didn't want to do the dirty act that they both were thinking of doing.</p> <p>A long pause of silence followed, as he played it the way he always did, slowly working her up to some semblance of calmness. She reached her arms up behind her head and back, her body arching backward against him as he worked his fingers deeper and deeper into her ass, his other hand still working her tits.</p> <p>"Fuck me, daddy," she whimpered.</p> <p>He obliged. He put more lube on his fingers and placed them against her ass. He pressed against it slightly, pushing it a little more inside.</p> <p>"I've been waiting for this for so long," she said.</p> <p>She didn't really need to ask. He pushed his fingers further inside, pushing deeper past her sphincter.</p> <p>"There," she gasped. "God, yes."</p> <p>It was his turn to smile at her now. He could feel his finger deep inside her ass, as his other fingers worked the tightness in her pussy.</p> <p>He leaned forward so they would be in an almost perfect position. They kissed again, and her hand reached back to pull him closer. When their hips touched, they both felt the warmth of each others' bodies as they ground against one another with renewed urgency.</p> <p>His hand came down harder on her, and she arched her back. He continued to work two fingers deep inside her as she felt the hard, hard muscle of his cock inside her.</p> <p>Suddenly she felt something wet on her mouth, as her pussy got wetter in response. The combination of excitement and fear, the need, the fear, the excitement was too much for her to accept. She whimpered around his cock, and pulled him more tightly to her.</p> <p>She felt his body tense, and she sucked hard on his cock as she felt his seed surge through his shaft, filling her mouth.</p> <p>He collapsed on top of her. They were silent as she held him inside her, her heart beating erratically against her chest and chest. He pulled his fingers out of her and she held him with her hand as he slowly withdrew his fingers.</p> <p>"Did you like that?" she whispered, kissing him.</p> <p>"Definitely," he replied. "It was incredible."</p> <p>She looked over at him, his eyes still locked onto hers. "Do you want to do that again?" she asked, still smiling.</p> <p>"I know I'd love too, though."</p> <p>She kissed him, then reached her hand back down to his cock. She stroked it lightly. "Your cock is very big," she said, looking up at him.</p> <p>"Oh yeah," he said, feeling her hand move up and down his shaft. He kissed the back of her neck as she continued to stroke his cock.
