Her nipples were already sticking out hard and he couldn't resist them, so he went to work on her breasts, starting with her nipple and working to their ends, while she pushed his head down into her breasts, begging him to suck them both. This time when he was down low a bit, he got his tongue at her nipples to give them a quick flick.</p> <p>‘OH YES!!!!!’ she moaned, grabbing his head with one hand and pulling on the string of her bikini with the other. Her hands were now all over his head, and she was pulling him close to her. In and out he sucked her tits, and she ran her fingers through his hair gently.</p> <p>‘Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, ohhhhhhh!!!’ She was really moaning now, and she started to shake her whole body as the orgasm hit her. The sensation of her breasts bouncing on her chest, and her nails digging into his skull as she rode him, was the sweetest thing ever. Suddenly he pulled away, letting go of one of her nipples, and she fell back on the sand.</p> <p>‘Oh, I think that will come in handy, won't it?’ She sat up on her elbows, turned around so that her head was by mine, and kissed me, gently. We shared the first kiss of all, and then she slowly sat down on my lap, and kissed my lips and neck. He was right; hers were the sweetest spots on the inside of her back. I was feeling the excitement, knowing that our little adventure had turned her on, and her body felt good against me. We both just lay there for a moment, then she pulled off my boxers and looked me in the eye.</p> <p>‘I like your body, you really are an excellent kisser,’ she said with a giggle.</p> <p>‘I’m glad you like mine too,’ I replied with a grin.</p> <p>‘Well, you look like you enjoyed my little strip tease there, didn’t you?’ she asked.</p> <p>‘I can’t deny a compliment like that. It was amazing.’ I said, giving her a soft kiss.</p> <p>‘It’s going on now. I have an early flight back to Boston, so I thought I might get a chance to catch up on some practice, and maybe a massage, too.’ ‘I guess that would be nice.’</p> <p>‘You know, I like a lot of things that aren’t true, don’t you?’</p> <p>‘Mmmmmmmm.’</p> <p>‘Me too.’</p> <p>‘But seriously, we did a pretty good job of making each other forget there were any limits.’</p> <p>‘Just let me do these things,’ I said as I pulled her into a kiss. I didn’t want to push her too far, but I wanted to make sure that they were going to stay that way for a while, and I didn’t want to cause further problems. She was a bit more passive now, though I didn’t think of that as a challenge.</p> <p>‘Yes, I agree completely. I don’t know if, what, you are just going to have to decide how you want to start our relationship.’</p> <p>‘No, it won’t be a game.’</p> <p>‘I didn’t say it wouldn’t just be a game either. I just want you to decide right now. I would really like to make love with you, you know? It’s so nice that we still have a lot of time together, and we should enjoy ourselves for a while.’</p> <p>‘No, I guess you’re right. Actually, I was going to make the next move. Now I can just enjoy my time with you just one of the things that will make me happier.’</p> <p>‘Okay, but you’ll have to set the terms.’</p> <p>‘But that was the plan anyway, didn’t you think?’</p> <p>‘Nahhh, no way.’</p> <p>‘I just want to make sure everything works out with you, even if it is only a little bit of a time. Maybe we can even do another first-time kiss, after all, and then we do a bit of dancing in the shower.’</p> <p>‘—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
