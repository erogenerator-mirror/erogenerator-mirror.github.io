Then she laughed and kissed again.</p> <p>I got out of bed and was getting dressed when we heard some voices coming from downstairs. It wasn't very long before somebody came in and sat a couple of seats down to the side and leaned on the table to say hello.</p> <p>The guy who had been sitting was a tall, blond guy with shoulder length hair, a very good build, and not surprisingly wearing no shirt. He was about five-five, but I figured he was in his early sixties. He was probably in his late-forties with glasses and a lot of make-up on, but was wearing a long sleeve summer yellow sleeveless blue shirt with nothing underneath. The man was carrying a couple of glasses and a pack of paper bag on his shoulders and he looked about forty-five. If it weren't for the fact that my wife was giving his ass in a few other places, it sure looked like he had been in bars or somewhere in between. But, in his case, it was obvious that he had been drinking.</p> <p>"Hi, I'm Ed," he said. "We're having a meeting at the bar downstairs at eleven tonight. Can you come too?"</p> <p>"Are friends for the time being?" asked Ed.</p> <p>"Not really," Ed responded. "We all work around the pool and that's about all we do. We both know how much your wife has liked the pool, and I'm pretty sure it's been a fantasy of hers, too." He smiled at my wife and I and winked. "You two are going to love it. Come on over and have some wine, and the beer is on the side table."</p> <p>The woman behind the counter came over and shook her head. "No thanks. I really don't have a place to stay at that place, and the place isn't much for partying either." And she motioned to my wife to go over there.</p> <p>She leaned over the counter and whispered something into my wife's ear. Ed nodded and smiled broadly. And when the woman was out of sight, the man in the shirt asked, "Is there a lady friend with you?" Ed nodded again, smiling and motioned to the man next to him. He reached to Ed's shoulder with his hand and pulled it toward the table near the window.</p> <p>My wife glanced around and gave me a little wave which I returned. The man was about ten years older than Ed, with dark brown hair, and dressed in a white T-shirt and black leather pants. He held a couple of glasses and a small bag, and gestured for the woman to come over. She shook hands with me and introduced herself and said hello. She was wearing a bikini that was fairly conservatively modest, but was much less conservative than most of the women I had been with here. She seemed to be about forty-one or so and had long, blonde, straight, and slightly rounded features. She was wearing a pair of cut-off jeans and a white short-sleeved V-neck blouse that was slightly flirty, but showed a lot of cleavage. The skirt was short and very short. It showed all of her legs and her legs were well defined and well displayed. My wife got out her wallet and took out several twenties, but kept the change in her hand.</p> <p>"I'm Dave," the man said. "We'll be there at nine."</p> <p>"Good. I'll call you."</p> <p>"Bye," said my wife as she walked toward the door, waving again as she walked.</p> <p>My wife and I sat there a little while longer and then she took her husband's hand in hers. "Can I help you?" she asked him.</p> <p>"We're married for one thing, and you're the exception. He has always been a good boy," said Ed.</p> <p>They finished their coffee and left, leaving our three or four minutes to get to our place.</p> <p>Before we made it up to our place, Ed pulled out his wallet.</p> <p>"What's this?" I asked as I handed him his own wallet.</p> <p>"Open it up and see."</p> <p>I was looking at it when Ed handed it to me. Inside the wallet there were a set of keys, each with a small charm at the end. I opened the door and they were inside. The room was very warm and smelled faintly of chlorine, and we both took off our shirts.</p> <p>"They're beautiful," said Ed. "Are you married?"</p> <p>"Nope," I laughed.
