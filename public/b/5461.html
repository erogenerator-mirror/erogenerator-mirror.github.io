"We can't tell a woman your husbands or your children it was wrong. We know it won't change your mind, Baby. We won't tell anyone. We just won't say anything."</p> <p>Mandy sighed. She reached back and lifted a breast in each hand. She pulled away from his lips and looked him in the eyes again.</p> <p>"You'll have to trust me, honey, that I will never hurt you."</p> <p>"I don't know... why won't you touch me, please?"</p> <p>"Because its right?" he told her, giving her nipple a hard pinch through her blouse as he pulled away from her.</p> <p>"Maybe... I don't know... maybe not...," she murmured. "Can we get away with that, please?</p> <p>"Fine, I guess," he said, standing up. "But you better take those stupid panties off!"</p> <p>"Oh," she smiled, her fingers reaching behind her to unfasten the buttons of her short skirt. When they were all down to the waist, she slipped them off her legs. She stood there with her hands at her sides as he stood there admiring her naked body. Her breasts were full and firm, her nipples standing large and hard in the cool air.</p> <p>She reached up to her blouse to gently touch her breasts and smiled at him.</p> <p>"It wasn't fair for you to be the one to break any trust that we have," he said softly. "Come help me get my shirt on, Beautiful."</p> <p>In a flash, her shirt was off and his shirt off and she was standing there before him in her bra and panties. He grinned at how beautiful she was.</p> <p>"Honey, this is silly," she whispered. "I'm not wearing anything under this."</p> <p>"Not for you," he said, cupping her breasts. "For me."</p> <p>They embraced as he slid his hands down to her rear and helped her slip her panties off of her. She smiled down at him as her cheeks pushed into his groin.</p> <p>"I've heard about that bra you're wearing," he whispered, smiling against her shoulder as he slipped his fingers inside it again. "So, how do you want it?"</p> <p>The answer was simple, "I want to be naked," she said simply as she turned and faced the mirror. As she turned, her eyes focused on the image before her.</p> <p>"You're beautiful. I wanted to have sex with you. But I'm too stupid to think about it."</p> <p>"It's not that," she said, turning her head slightly. "Sometimes it's hard for me. Not for you. I'm old enough to be married. And sometimes I have other men who use my body for their pleasure."</p> <p>"I'm so lucky to have you," he told her, reaching around her and pulling her face toward his. Slowly, he slid the length of his tongue into her mouth. His hand found its way to her bottom and began to knead the soft flesh, squeezing her ass as he slipped one finger down her crack to find her opening.</p> <p>His finger slid inside her and she closed her eyes and let out a gasp of pleasure. She pushed her pelvis upward against his hand and moaned into his mouth. He slid two fingers inside her and then slid them out as she moaned his name.</p> <p>"Do you want me to eat you out tonight, Honie?" he asked as he kissed her.</p> <p>"Yes!" she shouted as he moved his fingers inside her, stretching her open. "Please, Honey, finger-fuck your hot little cunt hard, don't leave it empty, please!"</p> <p>"Why don't you take it off?" he asked as he eased his fingers back out and slowly stroked the insides of her thighs as she spread them just a touch. "Show me what feels good, Baby."</p> <p>With a little push, she reached behind into his lap and undid his pants as she pulled his slacks and shorts from his hips. His cock sprung free, pushing out against his belly and pointing the way toward her face.</p> <p>Mandy dropped to her knees, taking the head between her lips. She ran her tongue around it and then began to tease just the tip as she sucked strongly, her eyes never leaving his. His groan told her she looked good as her tongue madeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
