Her long legs splayed out from underneath the table, the hem of her skirt barely covering her shaven vagina. Her bare stomach and breasts heaving, her hair wild as she breathed on to me. I was breathing heavily and was about to reach for her as the waiter finished putting the finishing touches to the appetizer as we stood up. She looked at me and smiled, a quick glance around the restaurant. She knew I was feeling good from the way that she was looking me over and by the way she was teasing me. She was very sexy.</p> <p>I made my way up to her table and she looked me up and down. Her legs were so exposed and so warm. She pulled me toward her and opened her thighs so that I could see all of her. I could see her lips were parted and a little wet that I was dying to touch. Her lips were swollen and spread, the pink hole of desire beckoning me. So inviting. I had to taste her right then.</p> <p>I slipped my tongue out of the side of my mouth and ran it up the length of her slit until it hit her clit. When I touched it she pushed her hips upward and began to move her ass in time with my tongue. Before long I was licking her hard from the bottom to the top and back again. She was moaning and rocking her hips against my tongue as I licked her from her clit to her ass. It was so easy and it was so incredible. I could feel her legs tighten around my ears as she moved about and thrusting her ass against me. She lifted her head up from the chair, her hair fanned over her face. She looked beautiful and sexy as she looked down at me and started to kiss my face.</p> <p>When she let it go she told me to stop and said that we should order something. I don't care if it is hot or cold or if it is expensive, I just ordered a salad or a burger. I could have said something, told her we were wasting food and made the comment of that it wasn't a salad but it was good food and the waiter came by soon to help. He asked me to order a large salad. I asked him to return when we had brought the salads. I ordered potato, a salad, chicken fingers, a bottle green wine, a medium size green potato and a small piece of lettuce. I even ordered an assortment of vegetables. But there was something else.</p> <p>She got up and pulled me to my feet and kissed me deeply. I had to taste her. She got up and put my salad in the sink. Then sat me down and I had a chance to admire her body as she got my salad ready. Her hips were flexing, pulling the hem of her skirt up as she leaned over so that the skirt stayed tucked in tightly around her waist and exposing her tits. Her nipples were hard and I could see they were sticking out almost an inch or two. She moved so that I could rub against them with both arms. I kept my fingers as straight and gentle as possible and she smiled as she enjoyed my touch. She took her salad in her hands and placed it on the tile then stood up again, her knees straddling mine as she walked around the table.</p> <p>My jaw dropped to the floor as she dropped to her knees. "I knew you were hungry. You're delicious." She wrapped her arms around my waist and pulled me to her and kissed me again. She looked into my eyes and said: "Now, we can eat."</p> <p>She pulled away and put her face down on her forearms on the table. She lifted her skirt up over her ass before walking back toward the table. I could see every inch of her ass and the pussy that I imagined her mouth would be on. I took the salad out of the back of my pocket. My cock was hard and straining to be free and without any lubrication. I grabbed the salad dish with the lettuce and put it on the floor between her legs, which I had set the salads on. I took a quick glance and watched her head bob down, licking the salad with her lips and tongue. Just a few seconds later her skirt was lifted up so high that the top of my head was pressing against the headboard. She looked back at me and reached back and started pushing her skirt out of the way again.</p> <p>I looked at her and told her with my eyes that it would be all right to fuck her. She turned and ran her hands over her ass then up her body to her breasts. She squeezed and fondled her tits while I pushed my cock against her ass again. It felt so good, so fucking good. She told me that it was like fucking her for the second time and started grinding her ass against my cock. My hips rocked forward against her ass as I fucked her pussy. I loved looking at it as I fucked her like this and watchingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
