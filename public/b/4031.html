His voice breaks out of my thoughts when he speaks.</p> <p>"You are so irresistible."</p> <p>"If you are." That was what I was thinking to myself, like I was hearing a low-toned melody, like an old song.</p> <p>He is walking with me towards the house and I am starting to feel the effects a little. The house is beautiful and cool in the summer breeze and I see that he just finished eating. He takes a couple more steps towards me, taking me with him and we continue for a bit of a distance behind. We make small talk and we are both very comfortable with one another. Then, it is time to get to the house. When we walk up the stairs, I can see his hand still holding mine while we get to our destination.</p> <p>It was a large house and he leads me to the right before heading around to his left. We are at the edge of the house already and looking around. He stops us before he enters the room. He motions to me to follow and then he follows. We both go to take a nice look around. He turns around while I get excited by the sound of his voice and his demeanor. I know that he likes what he sees and I feel that my little game has turned into something else. My heart is starting to beat faster and my hands are starting to hurt. I feel as if I will fall down and I am about to let out an involuntary yell when he turns around and walks towards me. It is like the air has been knocked out of me and now I am standing at his end of the doorway. His body is moving with me. My arms are shaking and I am breathing heavy. He smiles at me while looking me up and down. I am feeling like my heart is beating a mile a minute. The sight makes my nipples seem even harder. I can feel our hearts pounding and we both still manage to keep breathing. When he gets to my side, he sits down on the end of the bed. I am just about to protest when he puts his hands up under my shirt and unbuttons it. He has my shirt pulled up over me and there it is. I am not wearing any bra. He slowly unbuttons my shirt. It doesn't take long for us both to lose their composure and he removes my shirt completely and throws it on the floor. He starts to caress my chest and moves his hands up and down my body. He is standing in front of me in only his boxers. I cannot believe how much he looks like an animal. I have always wondered about the effect that we can have on a girl, but now I have an idea. I am beginning to feel the weight of his body on me. It is not what I expected from anyone of a younger and it feels different. We are standing in his home and he is naked before me.</p> <p>I want to start with the clothes off but I do not want to rush the experience. He takes my hand and leads me to the back bedroom. It is about a bedroom, but the door is closed and we can't really go in there. On our side of the bed he undresses down to a pair of boxers. I don't know what he is packing so I don't know what to think of him. He sits on the bed in front of me and starts to take off his boxers. It seems to take forever and as I'm not exactly sure what to do, he finally stops and removes the boxers. I don't know what to expect but I do expect him to be the most beautiful sight in the world. My heart is racing and I can't believe that I want it to happen. I can't wait to be with him. I pull off my shirt, bra, and pants off in record time. Our bodies are now both naked and I feel just like a girl when I am excited. My nipples are throbbing and I can feel my body responding. I love the way his body makes me feel. I can feel my hands on his back. I am looking down at his strong arms and he is holding up the back of my pants. I feel that same need for him that I have for women. I want him to run his hands all over every inch of his body. I feel his hands lightly touch my waist. I move my hands down slowly from his arms but stop as the feel of his skin against mine is amazing.</p> <p>I can't think about anything else, only how I want him to make love to me. I have no hesitation in opening my legs in front him. I place myself fully on his lap looking into his eyes with nothing but passion and anticipation. He starts to run his hands down my torso and moves his hands around to rest on my ass. He moves his body upwards and positionsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
