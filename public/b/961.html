I knew that it wasn't what I really needed to tell him. It also wouldn't change the fact that it was my husband who had cheated on me. He had loved fucking me with the strap-on he picked to be my hubby. He had just about split me in two, so he needed an excuse to screw me.</p> <p>He hadn't been the best lover I ever had, as far as I was concerned, but he was the same with his big cock still in me. We have enjoyed our sex life and, no, we have not just finished. He and my wife really had been faithful. I really have loved my husband. He is the love of my life.</p> <p>As he is fucking me, he is saying all these things to me about being true to my husband. "I love you John, I have loved you with all my heart! I always knew you would be the best pussy I could ever fuck! I do love you!"</p> <p>I don't know what he's saying. I think that he has gone through a lot of pain and suffering before finally finally giving in. He says, "John, don't you think I did wrong to you the first time we ever saw each other?"</p> <p>That hurts me because I love him so much. There has been this little voice in his mind saying that we can't have a baby right now. I don't know what the big voice is anymore. I don't know if it is the pain I feel from the real pain of losing my husband, or the deep sadistic thrill that it gives me by watching him fuck someone else. All I know in my sadistic lust is that he can make love to me all he wants, and just don't care how he ends or what he does. He is really doing everything in his power to make me the happiest woman he can possibly be.</p> <p>I really don't care which one it is. I love him with all my heart, but I love the big one and don't care about my own happiness either. That big one hurts me, and I don't know what to do about it. I don't even care that I fucked my poor poor cheating husband because he has cheated.</p> <p>I guess I have become a nymphomaniac because I enjoy it, like I enjoy being tied to a bed for hours and having my pussy used by my husband while he fucked me in the ass is so satisfying, so erotic, and so erotic.</p> <p>When I first started seeing him, what I didn't like was how he treated me. He could tell right away that I was the bitch in the house, and he didn't listen when I yelled at him until he showed me how to talk.</p> <p>This time, I didn't think it would be that hard. When I met him I felt humiliated. He made no effort to hide his disdain of me. He just fucked my brains out in one way or another. If I knew it wouldn't bother him, I'd feel better now.</p> <p>I liked it with my husband. It meant that he was a better lover as my friend who I was friends with when we made love. However, as time went on, I started to doubt that my friend could fuck me in the ass like I could, and not care at all about anything else. It felt kind of like that to him, and he would have to make some effort to make that effort, but he would have to make good on the promise he made me to a good friend.</p> <p>One time, after the one man I hadn't wanted to marry, I had an accident. I was in the middle of taking a bath, and I was walking into the living room. I was naked when I saw that he was there. He told me to keep the water running while he took a shower. It was only when I got into the shower with him that his attitude changed.</p> <p>I think he felt that as soon as he saw me standing in the shower with him that he wanted to fuck me again. I don't know what it was. I am his friend, and I just wanted him so badly that I felt he had to ask me to be the best lover he could be. I didn't know if I could do that. I didn't know what to think. It just felt so right.</p> <p>We had been in the room for about two hours and we were both about to leave. I had been holding my breath, and he asked me to hold it. His voice was as though it was the most natural thing in the world. As he kissed me on the lips, his hands were all over me. I melted all over. It was so sudden. It felt like the world was moving on its axis. I guess I was too afraid to leave the wet shower.</p> <p>He went back to get a towel and when Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
