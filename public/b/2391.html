She cannot have me, and she must find me if I want to give her a child or if I want to be with her." I said.</p> <p>"Oh you will have my child if you do love me." She said, and kissed me so passionately, as if she was begging me.</p> <p>I just laughed and said, "Well, maybe later then. I do love you."</p> <p>And I was in her body, and all of the things we had done together, she said when we were alone as we had been. I laughed again as I put my arm around her. We were kissing and holding each other as soon as our bodies made contact.</p> <p>For many minutes I could feel her body, as she was so alive, and yet also the tension in her. Her body was so warm, and in such a position with her hair, she must have taken extra care about it, as she was laying beside me. She had both hands, over hers, on both my cock and her pussy, she started to kiss me.</p> <p>"Darling, you make me a wonderful woman. The pleasure you feel is so wonderful." She said smiling.</p> <p>Our kiss made me feel weak, and when we parted, after our bodies were so near. She said, "I need to shower so badly."</p> <p>After we were both in bed, in each others arms, with her hand on mine, as if wanting to feel me again, I said, "I want to, but I will have another hour before the clock." I said.</p> <p>"I can understand that but, maybe it is time to take off."</p> <p>I heard the door, and she said "we don't have to take off. I can still use the bathroom, which is close".</p> <p>I stood up and looked at her and said, "Can I stay?"</p> <p>"Yes, you can stay. I don't know that I trust you."</p> <p>I went back to my apartment, where she had taken off her clothes, as she had taught me. I turned down a street, and she waited outside the small shop before she came out. She had gone on all of her shopping, and in her hand was a large shopping bag.</p> <p>I said, "You really are beautiful like that."</p> <p>"Thanks." She said and she closed the door behind her.</p> <p>I went back at home as usual, and decided to get a book for the night. I was tired, and took a nap. When I went down to see her, a girl was standing by her bed door, looking in.</p> <p>"How much do you want to go with me?"</p> <p>"Yes, I want to go with you."</p> <p>"Very well. I will go buy some things for dinner." I said.</p> <p>I didn't go, but stayed behind.</p> <p>When I came home, I found her sitting up, on her bed. The room was dark. The clock was running, so I knew she would be asleep.</p> <p>She said, "I think I need a nice bath first."</p> <p>I went into her bathroom and took off my clothes, as she looked at me with eyes, and said, "You don't have to take off, it is safe here."</p> <p>"Yes, I think it is safe here." I said. She was just lying next to me looking very beautiful. When I had stripped down to my bums, she had gone to the bathroom. My erection was not quite as big as it was. I walked and sat on the couch. I opened her book, and read. She said, "You know, many of my teachers are not as nice as my mother. Now that she has died, so has my father. I don't think much of anyone like my father."</p> <p>"What about his father?" I asked.</p> <p>"Don't answer that. He never left me. If he had, we could have had children soon. My father was nice, and never had to force an argument in my mind, and I never could have stopped feeling bad for my father."</p> <p>I said, "I see, but I want to take care of him."</p> <p>"No I mean when he was like you, I wanted a man to keep me, or keep me as strong as possible. Now, you must do as I tell you."</p> <p>I said, "Yes, I am going to follow. Please do as I tell you."</p> <p>She said, "I must tell you. You are to get undressed and come in for dinner."</p> <p>I had my clothes on the floor. When she came in, she sat on the bed next to me.
