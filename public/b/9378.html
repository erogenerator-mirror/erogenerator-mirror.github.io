She asked.</p> <p>I shook my head to shut off the anger I felt.</p> <p>I didn't know why I didn't know why she had gotten so mad at me and she seemed completely satisfied with my actions. I figured I had been too stubborn to accept my punishment; maybe her anger had been too obvious. I didn't know why she hadn't wanted me to continue. I decided I would play it by ear.</p> <p>"Okay, I'm gonna go," I said.</p> <p>I went to get my jacket off of the back of my desk and walked back to where my secretary was waiting for me.</p> <p>"Come on, be a sport," she said.</p> <p>I walked behind her to grab a pen, "Can I have a chance to finish here before I go?" I asked nervously.</p> <p>She reached over and put her hands on my shoulders. The contact felt good and I could see her eyes fluttering as she looked me up and down. I was going to give in now.</p> <p>"Go in and wait for me," I said.</p> <p>I didn't think I wanted it but I didn't need to be afraid. After a moment of hesitation, I walked inside and waited. I heard the door open. When she walked in smiling, I had a strange feeling. Even though her face was a bit wrinkled, she had gotten a lot bigger. Maybe it was my imagination.</p> <p>When she closed the door, I felt like all the rage was gone.</p> <p>"Damn it," I said. "I'm really sorry to have to do this."</p> <p>She smiled.</p> <p>"It's ok," she said looking down. "I just want to see if I can get some work done and maybe have some fun."</p> <p>I took another deep breath.</p> <p>"Ok," I said.</p> <p>I walked up to her and pressed myself to her. I could feel my cock pressing into her ass. She reached around with both hands, took my hands and put my palms on her cheeks. I could feel her shiver.</p> <p>"Good," she said. "This won't hurt, will it?"</p> <p>"No," I said. "Let me try."</p> <p>I pushed my cock up against her ass and she pushed back. The feeling was weird but I had never felt so full. I was getting a hard on by the feeling of her ass. I don't know how much longer I could take this. Once she felt it in, she pushed out a couple times before she backed up again and slowly rubbed my dick. She got my hand on her ass and held onto it. The feeling was so incredibly erotic. I pulled her close for a kiss.</p> <p>"You like it?" she asked.</p> <p>I nodded.</p> <p>"Tell me what you like," she whispered in my ear.</p> <p>"I like...being...you," I said. "I don't know why."</p> <p>"It's what you've always wanted...just to be with."</p> <p>I wanted to tell her how I felt but I didn't want to.</p> <p>"If you're that good...just let me know," she said. "I love to be with you. When you're in my arms all you worry about is what will be. All you will ever worry about is...the end of the world."</p> <p>"Ok," I said. "I love you."</p> <p>As soon as I said it, I felt her ass relax a bit. The feeling of her ass cheeks grinding against me gave me so much pleasure. My dick was pressing against her ass and the feeling felt amazing.</p> <p>"I love you," I said. "I love to be in your arms. I know I'm not the only one loving you."</p> <p>She pulled away from me. She moved her hands up to my neck and pulled my face down to hers. Her lips met mine in a fiery, passionate kiss and her hands moved back down to my shoulders and down my arms to my wrists. Her soft hands felt amazing on my skin. I loved her for taking her time and not being selfish. I also couldn't help but grab her ass and pull her closer.</p> <p>We broke our kiss and I breathed heavily but kept my head in between her tits as our lips made their way down to her neck. She pulled me back to her by my collar bone and her lips made contact with my cheek. The feeling was so amazing.</p> <p>"I love you," she said. "I love your neck."</p> <p>"I love yours," I said.</p> <p>I moved one hand up to her face and I grabbed the back of her neck with my index finger and pulled her head toward me. Before I could press her lips with my own, she pulled my face down and kissed me again. My lips were all over hers and it was so warm and intimateâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
