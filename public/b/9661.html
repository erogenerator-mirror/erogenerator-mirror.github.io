"But, my poor darling, I know you want to feel me touching you and I'm glad to do it now."</p> <p>She lifted my head and looked into my eyes. She pushed my skirt up, my thighs were bare, my lips glistened with tears.</p> <p>"I want to feel what you could be holding in your hands, when you're with him." She cupped my breasts from behind, her body pressed against mine, and she started to kiss my neck and ears. Her hands slid down my sides. "I've told you before that I am a breast man. But, I think that you really do love me and I think when you look at me that the only reason you are holding me so tightly is because I can feel your passion and you really think that is what I do. When you are with Daddy, it was a good feeling. I love feeling your love for me and I really don't care who is with me. But when you and Daddy are together, when I'm with you, like last night and you touched me, I think it was just right because you didn't need to. It's just that I'm having my first ever sexual experience. It was so good when you used to touch me. Don't tell me that I didn't like it."</p> <p>"Oh! You're so wet! It was all right, I didn't hurt you."</p> <p>"But, my pussy is all hot and juicy down there." She was grinding into me. "You can feel it, don't you? You do love my pussy, don't you?"</p> <p>"I love you," I whimpered. I was so overwhelmed with emotion that I had no control, no desire to stop, no one to stop, even Daddy. I didn't ever want to stop loving her, not even for the physical feelings she gave me, but there was a part of me which wanted to hold her as if she was a piece of me that could be mine forever, if you would let me hold her."</p> <p>"I know what you are feeling, and you're feeling the same things. Your head and chest are wet, your mouth is shiny...but, not even your pussy is wet."</p> <p>"My husband isn't like that, Daddy." Her hand reached down and cupped my pussy, its warmth spreading over it. She rubbed my lips, wetting them and my clit. "I can feel you, as if it were yours. I think you need to know that there are so many reasons why it's a good thing that we did this."</p> <p>"Yes!" I said, as my hands came up and took one of her hands. "It's your pussy that is being played with and felt, and I want it to be yours too, Daddy."</p> <p>"And," she said softly, "I am touching you all over and I want you to be touched, and felt all over."</p> <p>"But," I continued, "I still think to myself that it might be your place to continue." She reached down, took my hand and brought it to her mouth. She put her lips on the tip of my hand, sucked softly and slid my hand down her body. My fingers caressed her, her legs parted and my fingers went between them. I could imagine that she was already getting wet, my fingers would be a slippery, silky lubricant, but her juices were warm, so warm, and wet. I thought to myself that I would be in heaven for ever, I felt her legs open and spread around my fingers as I gently pushed and pulled at her.</p> <p>"Go ahead, Daddy. Touch me," she whispered in my ear.</p> <p>"How may I do that, Daddy?" I whispered back. I had to know to find that special spot, I needed to know so that I could push into her, feel her warmth, her body around me, her juices. I found that special spot. My fingers started to stroke and rub it, feeling it pulse with every stroke of my fingers. I knew that I wasn't going to last very long but it didn't matter.</p> <p>"Oh, Daddy," she whined, "I want to feel your fingers inside me like you did that night that you took me in the barn." She held my hand there and lifted her body off the floor. I let my fingers go down. I touched her there, felt her heat and moisture. I held her leg as she laid back on the floor, her fingers stroked her lips and I felt her fingers part. Her body was quivering as my fingers caressed her. Every time her fingers moved down, as if I was touching her soul, it stopped right before it touched mine. She held my hand steady as she lifted her legs and closed them around my handâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
