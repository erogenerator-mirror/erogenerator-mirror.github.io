"We never went into detail about that," she added, "so don't worry, if you have to be around soon, it won't be anything I don't agree with"</p> <p>"I know, I know" she added, "but just remember your husband is out of town on business."</p> <p>At that, I looked at her and she stared into my eyes.</p> <p>She looked as if she would say something, but then just smiled, took my hands, put them on her breasts and led me to the bed, where she pulled me on my back.</p> <p>Soon, she was kneeling beside the bed, as she started to kiss my lips. Soon, I was responding with kissing, so she took my hands and put them over her breasts, taking a nipple in each hand. I could feel that she was very excited, and her eyes were open, looking at me.</p> <p>Soon, I felt her wet cunt on my thigh, and her fingers found their way to my own. I could feel the warmth as my fingers traced the wetness through and around her pubes, and down the valley to her slit. I couldn't get my fingers out of her without touching her, and we had a wonderful and wonderful mutual climax.</p> <p>I wanted to keep doing that thing in the car, but when she started to lay beside me again, I just had to have it again.</p> <p>"I don't know if that was a good thing, but just go with it," I said.</p> <p>"I don't think I have been with anyone, and don't feel like I have to share you with anybody. In fact, I might have to be the one to join in, and if you're interested, I suppose we can try, I won't be mad."</p> <p>We must have looked at each other right away, because she added, "I guess what I'm trying to say is that sex is all that matters."</p> <p>"I'll just have to keep on going," she added. "Do you have any condoms?"</p> <p>"I don't, no" I said. "But we could try"</p> <p>She didn't want to go that far, but she thought, so we decided she might, and she just didn't use any.</p> <p>We got into the car to take our turn. I don't know if it was the drive, or if she thought she might, but she didn't have any birth control, and did not seem to care who got her pregnant, or did that bother her at all. We did our own thing, and then we had a marvelous little fun.</p> <p>When we got home, she had opened a bottle of wine and had made me a light lunch. She even made sure I hadn't got a headache, and took the pills, making it clear she was going to get more of mine now. When we both went to bed, she had a little surprise for me...</p> <p>In a quiet voice, "Don't forget to go down there, and take some birth control".</p> <p>I was stunned. I had never thought of her as my partner in life, and had never had a man say that to me either. The answer to that was, of course, that I was not about to fuck her, but was there anything that she could do to show that she was interested in more than a quick, little flash, and have me get on my knees and have her do it.</p> <p>"I still don't want to make love, so don't think I wouldn't like it if you wanted to."</p> <p>At first I had her stay overnight, and not take the precaution of being over her mother's side of the bed to do so. It was no more than two, and she wouldn't be disturbed.</p> <p>I got up, took out the condoms from a box and started to put them on the bed. She said something about a "big, strong dick" as she walked over to the bed, which I didn't understand until she sat down next to me. Soon, she was stroking my body and rubbing my breasts, my belly and my pussy.</p> <p>She leaned her head down to me, and I felt her breath on my pussy. She pulled away, taking off the condom, and lay down against my leg.</p> <p>Without saying a word, she lifted my hips to get my pussy to hers, and pushed her face on my pussy. I put my hand on her face and stroked her there, feeling the wetness of the slit. My hand found another little bud right near my clit, and when I touched it, I could feel the electricity surge through me, and she could. Her face was right on mine, breathing heavily and moaning as the sensations coursed through her.</p> <p>I could hear her licking, sucking on me as she sucked onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
