I could just as easily have said no to my offer to see your Dad!"</p> <p>I didn't want to let her off the hook that easily.</p> <p>I got up, took an arm of her shoulder and walked her towards the door, "If you say so!"</p> <p>I turned her and said, "I'm not going anywhere near that house either!"</p> <p>"I'm going to my dorm room. I want to go visit, and then go and see what happens. It will be good to see your Dad."</p> <p>I was thinking, "Well, this is way easier than I had the other night...what in hell am I going to do?" and started laughing.</p> <p>I let her take me in her arms and we stayed there for a few moments before I put my arms around her and began leading her to her room.</p> <p>A few more minute of kissing and fondling and her kissing me like she had been doing it all our lives. I wasn't about to let her go and let her do this right now.</p> <p>Once in her room she turned around and I leaned her into me. She put her hands around my neck and we continued our intimate embrace for several long moments. I felt her body pressing close to me and I let my hands wander all over her before moving one over and down the front of her body.</p> <p>I took her hands in mine and moved them down, over her thighs and then onto her breasts. She pushed her chest towards me and gave me little jabs that I was looking forward to.</p> <p>I finally sat her down on the bed and gently unzipped her pants. I slipped the pants and panties down her legs and finally she stepped out of them. I went to my bag for her panties and was looking for her bra. I found one and got her bra off before she turned around to go get it. I helped her out of her pants and panties and got off them as well.</p> <p>I took her hands, got her to her knees and pushed her onto her back. I leaned forward and she took the hint. I put her legs on my shoulders, lifted and lowered her so that her feet were flat on the bed and then lay her arms on my shoulders. She began to kiss my neck as I undid her bra and tossed it to the floor.</p> <p>I continued kissing her neck and down to her breasts. I could feel her nipples hardening and felt her legs starting to move.</p> <p>I got my hands on her breasts and began gently massaging them, paying special attention to her nipples. She began to sigh and writhe around on the bed.</p> <p>I was in her arms and was kissing her again. My hands were all over her breasts and I felt her hands sliding all over my body. I was trying to unbutton her blouse.</p> <p>She broke the kiss and said, "Honey," I was to busy undoing her blouse and removing the last of her clothing that was covering her body. "No," she said, "we have work to do."</p> <p>I pulled her blouse over her shoulders to cover myself and reached for the waistband of her panties but she took me up on my offer saying, "Let's take these off."</p> <p>I unbuttoned the last button of her blouse slowly and I could feel her trembling and I wanted to feel her as much as I wanted her as much as she wanted me. I slowly pulled the blouse off her shoulders and let it drop to the floor.</p> <p>I felt her hands run over my chest and down my stomach. I wanted to see her nipples. I felt them harden when she touched them. I took one hand up her leg and began to gently rub her thigh up and down, trying to get her to relax so I could stroke her pussy. She was completely under my power, though, and I knew her climax was coming soon.</p> <p>I moved a little closer to her and her eyes opened wide when I leaned forward and she reached out and wrapped both arms around my neck. I took her hands in mine and raised them to my lips and placed them on her breasts. She moaned softly. I did the same, and then moved my hands so we could move them up and touch.</p> <p>She turned her hands around so that they could be caressed as I rubbed her inner thighs with both hands.</p> <p>She was trembling a little as she rubbed all around my upper thighs, then I moved her hand down my crotch and felt the dampness there and I lowered my hands and allowed her hand to reach up to my crotch as I continued to rub her thighs.</p> <p>I pulled her hand down until she felt my cock and it was sticking up along with the rest of me.
