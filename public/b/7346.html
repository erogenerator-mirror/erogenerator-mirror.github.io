Do you have a spare? I'm sure that you're not in any other jurisdiction. I can understand a problem for you, but you have to understand the fact that you're a guest of the United States government and therefore the owner of your car is an American. Is this so?"</p> <p>He was right.</p> <p>"Well my driver's license, insurance papers, and insurance book came down last month and I can't say if they came out as far as I can tell. So, I'm stuck here. How is it you could afford to have me back?"</p> <p>"It's a two bedroom apartment with a bathroom and a shower. I can't say how much so I am going to use. I know that for a rental, you have to clean the place out daily and if you don't want to keep it clean, I would help you pay for it. As far as I will be concerned, you're going back to being a guest here. That's why I brought you in now."</p> <p>"Why did you need my insurance?"</p> <p>"I'm sure you knew about that, I can give you information about when and where you have to work and in what sorts of places. It's up to you if you'll stay with me and take care of both of us."</p> <p>"I'll let you know as soon as I can get the money and you can get your clothes."</p> <p>"Let me get a list of your expenses on your credit card and what you're paid."</p> <p>He signed the bill and had her deposit the change and his car. The receipt told her to keep in touch. She was glad to let him back in her life.</p> <p>They walked into the hotel and were escorted up the elevator to his penthouse apartment. Her clothes and purse were gone also.</p> <p>"Here you are," he said as they walked through the door.</p> <p>"I was hoping you had changed your mind about it. You're a man. I'm so glad that you've changed your attitude about this, it's been a long time since I've been out with a guy. You're very sweet and considerate and kind. I will always love you in return for your honesty and being there for me when some of the people here are not happy with you."</p> <p>"I will be there for you," she told him.</p> <p>He showed her to the bedroom and said he wouldn't be far before he returned. She told him that the place was furnished and it was in decent shape and she was hoping that she could get it all done before he came back again. She told him that she didn't care. It wasn't all that she could find in town that she liked and she didn't think he could do it at times. She asked him if he had any money to pay for dinner, clothes shopping, or even a few movies. His answer didn't shock her at all. He took her into his arms and kissed her, she told him if they were going to be together, it'd be worth it. She told him that she wanted to taste his cock and he would have to agree with her. He was agreeable to that. They left the room hand in hand and headed for the bed. As he climbed on top without having to ask, she told him she wanted to feel him inside her. She didn't have to ask him for permission. It wasn't a question anymore and it didn't have to be. They made love like only lovers can. He was wonderful to her, tender as his cock slid in and out. It was wonderful for both of them. Her legs were wrapped around him, they were making love again in a second when they were startled by the door being slammed behind them. It was too early to be afraid of someone leaving, so it was a surprise. She wondered what they were going to do while she was still inside him.</p> <p>As they lay there, she started to laugh.</p> <p>"I'll never believe that our last date was with a woman that I love," she told him.</p> <p>"I don't know if they told you, but in my defense, I wouldn't want that to happen again. Maybe it did, but I don't think so."</p> <p>"That was fun," she told him.</p> <p>"I'm sorry for my outburst. I just thought you deserved a break. I'm sure you liked it. You certainly know that I don't mean to be rude, but just do you have a date with me that you don't really feel comfortable with me in anyway?"</p> <p>"I have a date with you too. I had thought about you in that way before, but I'm not sure that I'm ready for that kind of commitment, so don't go there. I think thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
