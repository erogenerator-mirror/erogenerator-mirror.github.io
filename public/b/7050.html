"You know my schedule at work is a little different than yours. I'd probably be better off with you."</p> <p>"Oh, just relax baby, I'm taking you out to dinner tomorrow."</p> <p>"Well, we are definitely going out tomorrow. There's some new stores that will be open too."</p> <p>"Oh no, we're not going to eat at a strip club. This is a one on one type of club. I can't do that again. If you are going to wear anything besides a tux it might be good, I guess, to impress someone. I can't talk you into that. I've just got to make sure everyone here knows that I'm going to the opera tomorrow."</p> <p>"We have to go home now. Let me finish this up in my office. You were so easy to get into. It's your turn tomorrow. I can take care of you and that is that."</p> <p>"You do that and you'll have to wear a different shirt, because I've got my own place on the way home tonight. You won't have to do that."</p> <p>"Oh, you're right. I'll just make sure to change into it at the office. I have a feeling we will really be fucking in the car after all this."</p> <p>That last remark made her even more aroused. So there was a little more to tell him. It would be difficult to go down on her the way they did it but she knew it was necessary. Besides, it didn't have to be all that risky.</p> <p>****** ************* ***** ***** *************</p> <p>It had been a long day for Cindy. She was exhausted. She was sure that he would have made it. Hell, she had to tell him what she really wanted and he would have been happy to give it to her. At one o'clock in the morning her cell phone rang. It was him. He didn't know who it was but he knew that whoever it was that answered the phone was him. What was he doing there with her?</p> <p>"You there, Honey?"</p> <p>"Yeah, are you all right?" she answered.</p> <p>"Yeah. I'm here in the conference room. Where did you get this?"</p> <p>"I got it from your business trip to Miami. It's a private club of some sort. I didn't realize how much of a clientele there was until I saw you on the beach yesterday. How about you?"</p> <p>"Well I've been waiting for you. Did you miss me?"</p> <p>"Not really. I was just working."</p> <p>"Honey I could tell from your blouse that you were about ready to kill me. Maybe I could have gone home and waited for you. I can't make you because you know something that would kill me."</p> <p>"You sure you're okay with this?"</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"Can we talk when we get home tonight okay?"</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Of course."</p> <p>"Good. Go get some sleep. I'll call you tomorrow."</p> <p>"I'll be there for you when you get there."</p> <p>"I'm really starting to get tired. But if I don't have any sleep then I'll probably sleep with you tonight."</p> <p>"Okay. I'll come by by the office before I leave. I'll pick you up at eight."</p> <p>"You'll know when I get home," he replied.</p> <p>"I want to talk. I'm a little worried."</p> <p>"Talk. That's what I want to talk to you about. I think I'm falling for you baby. It is going to change our relationship and our lives."</p> <p>"I know but what can I do so that I can show you how much I love you?" her voice sounded serious.</p> <p>"I'm not leaving yet. I'm sure you can come by tomorrow and give me your loving attention."</p> <p>"Okay. I can stay a little while longer than absolutely necessary. But right now I need to get up and get in the shower. Do you need a hand with getting ready there?"</p> <p>"Yes. I'm on my way. Maybe I should come along and meet you at the office at sevenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
