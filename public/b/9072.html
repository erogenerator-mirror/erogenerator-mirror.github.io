I spoke in a breathless, happy tone.</p> <p>I couldn't wait for what happened next.</p> <p>"Now where was I?" My mind was swirling.</p> <p>"Let's find out just what happened in our relationship." I heard her say in a soft voice that sounded like a dream. "If you want to talk about it, we can sit here. It might make us both feel better." With that, she turned and walked away.</p> <p>The next thing I knew, there I was as I was reaching for her. We were pressed tight together as she took hold of my hands and placed them over her breasts. Her nipples seemed to be rock hard and I could feel them pressing against my palms as I pressed against her. I could feel them pressing against her, hard as a rock. The heat of her seemed to have enveloped her as we pressed our bodies tight together. "I think I should ask you something", I whispered into her ear as her breath hissed and I felt a small smile slip through her lips.</p> <p>"Of course you will. Anything, just ask."</p> <p>Hearing her say those words, coupled with what might have been her first statement of the day had I been alone with her, I would have asked her to marry me right there on that bed.</p> <p>There was the word, "I mean it". Her words and then, as she stood up, she smiled once again. It was as if the warmth of her body had somehow changed the color of her eyes.</p> <p>"I mean it." She repeated, but held out her arms towards me. "I... I feel like going slow and making you happy." She stated.</p> <p>She took both of her hands and raised them to my face. "I don't know... We can make sure of that." Her face seemed as if she was about to say something else. Instead, she lowered her hands to my face and kissed me.</p> <p>I was speechless.</p> <p>"I think that would make a difference." She stated. The look on her face as she spoke spoke so bluntly was priceless. I would have to say, "Is this the girl of my dreams?"</p> <p>What she had meant to say would make a difference for me too. I didn't care because she knew it also. She was only saying it because she wanted to please me.</p> <p>I wrapped my arm around her and held her to me. It was as if I couldn't get enough of her.</p> <p>"Well now we're friends again." She stated.</p> <p>"Oh, I think I'll do that again tomorrow." She commented. I was unsure how to react after the first time. Not having the energy to talk about what actually happened the night before or the other night, I just couldn't think of all the words to say.</p> <p>"How about we meet at your house next Friday, and see what happens?" She asked as she turned and left my side.</p> <p>In spite of what happened at the door, I had already felt that I knew that. It was as if she was giving me what others could only be grateful for. I couldn't keep it in my head for very long. I finally thought to myself that whatever I had with her would be wonderful. I wasn't thinking about anything else. All it was concerned were the things she could make me feel like. I couldn't think of anything but the feel of her. Then the time to move on. I couldn't think of a time to go back to the first time or the first time of our relationship. And I was right here in my own home alone with my ex wife. The realization hit me. I had had it with a girl I still loved and with a girl like her.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>I got to her place in an almost perfect frame of mind. I knew that she had been in bed with another woman the night before when I had been in bed with her. It would be like something from my past. But now, I could just get back to the present. It might seem odd that it would be her first time with another man, and it might seem strange that it would be us doing it again next Friday. She would never know, would never realize that.</p> <p>At that moment, I felt like I had known her for over a year. I saw her on nights when I really didn't care, and I saw her when she was in a mood. I felt like she knew that she was mine; that she just wanted the one thing that always gave her pleasure. I even remembered when she came home with a smile for me on Wednesdays, before she had gotten her wish. Then, my wife had been with me again and she had even allowed me to give her hand massages. What a day that would be for meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
