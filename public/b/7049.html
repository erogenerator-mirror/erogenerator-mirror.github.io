He immediately dropped to his knees and gently buried his face between her legs, gently licking her from bottom to top. He began to move his tongue upwards. She opened herself to him and they embraced each other.</p> <p>He worked his way back up to her clit. He gently blew his warm breath across it.</p> <p>She screamed.</p> <p>He looked up at her to see her eyes closed and her head thrown backwards. One hand on the wall, one knee raised on the bed, her arms over her head, the other buried into the sheets of the bed, one fist around her breast, fingers pinching her nipple. His other hand still cupping her pussy, his thumb now pushing in and out from her pussy lips. Slowly he felt the tension in her body go; she began to squirm under him in earnest. "Now I will fuck you." He continued to suck and lick her clit. He could hear her sighing. He knew that it had taken every bit of her willpower not to let him fuck her.</p> <p>He pushed as deeply as he could into her pussy as she felt he might come. They were both panting. She was biting her lip to avoid screaming.</p> <p>As the wave passed through her her clit was once more at attention.</p> <p>Again, he pushed as far as he could into her pussy and heard her gasp and her release, her vagina spasm, squeezing tightly around his cock. Their panting and moans were interspersed with grunts.</p> <p>He began to slowly raise his torso, his cock slowly easing out of her pussy. She moved her hips towards him.</p> <p>Without thinking, he brought his lips to hers. Their lips parted and they kissed deeply and passionately.</p> <p>He started sliding his cock in and out of her, just short of the brink of climaxes. She reached down with one hand and pulled his mouth down onto hers even more.</p> <p>At the brink, he stopped to ask softly, "Ready to come back to me?"</p> <p>She smiled, "Yes. Please."</p> <p>With his hands on her hips he gently lifted her up so that she straddled him. Without a word, he thrust his dick into her again. With one last push he buried his face in her neck and began to grunt and groan in time with his thrusts. Her body was vibrating as he filled her pussy with his shaft. Their eyes met and she felt the passion in his eyes as he continued to thrust within her.</p> <p>Her legs were around his hips as she felt his cock slide against her insides, inside of her, filling her; filling every part of her. It felt completely indescribable.</p> <p>As the orgasm came, she felt the tingling in her arms. "Oh, yesssss" she whispered into his ear, "I'm coming!!"</p> <p>Their lips pressed harder together as he thrust harder, deep into her, with longer thrusts. Her pussy clattered against him with each thrust. She was so close to coming. She could feel him swelling within her.</p> <p>They were both breathing hard, each trying to prolong the feeling of passion between them. Her juices mixed with his cock as he began his second climax. They both felt it beginning to wash over them both.</p> <p>They both let out low grunting cries that signified they had achieved climax, only for him to be held against her, his weight pinned to her, as if holding her body against his.</p> <p>They kissed each other like that for a long time. As they parted, she could not believe how lucky she was. She could not believe that she could come from feeling so completely possessed. Her mind drifted as she slowly came down from the feeling of being filled by another, smaller penis. They looked deeply into each other's eyes as they realized, there was no going back now.</p> <p>A tear slid down her cheek into his. He cupped her cheek and kissed it.</p> <p>"That was incredible!" He whispered, as he looked at her. "It was wonderful."</p> <p>"You too!" She replied. "Oh!"</p> <p>He hugged her close to him and they kissed for many long moments before they broke the silence.</p> <p>It was still not over.</p> <p>They were not really sure how to express what they had just experiencedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
