I asked. I held his gaze for long, long seconds, his arms still around my waist. "So...you and I...are...really going to fuck?"</p> <p>He looked at me skeptically. "What makes you think...about...having a son?"</p> <p>I sat on the bed, my legs between his. I turned to face him. "We...fuck. That's what you think about, right? How it feels to have our son? How it looks like...and what it takes for your wife to make love to a man? I don't have any son. We just fuck."</p> <p>He smiled and looked at the bed. "I don't know if I know you, Daddy..."</p> <p>"We're not 'we', honey. We're not going to fuck. We just want to get back to...fucking."</p> <p>He didn't know what to take it; did he want a son or not? He shook his head. "I was only going to say that a little bit."</p> <p>I slid my hand down to his lap and gripped the lump there through his shorts. "So? What else is there to say?" I slid my hand up and down his cock, my fingertips sliding slowly across the head. "But there is one more thing."</p> <p>"What's that, Daddy?"</p> <p>I pulled the bedding aside and pulled his shorts and underwear down to his ankles, leaving his cock exposed to me. I let my hand slowly slide around his shaft and back up again, feeling his flesh under my fingers as I slid over him. "I'm not fucking you."</p> <p>He looked confused. "But I think I'm fucking you, Daddy. Are you saying that you're going to fuck me when I make love to you in front of Daddy?" His eyes looked at me, looking for an agreement, but not finding one, so I kissed him, gently.</p> <p>I leaned forward and wrapped my lips around his cock and ran my tongue slowly along the length of him. His breath hitched in his throat. "You said it 'too'." My hand wrapped around his shaft and stroked the entire length, my fingers wrapped around the head and stroked the wetness of my fingers in an imitation of fucking. His fingers tightened against my hair. "Say it... Say, 'I'm fucking you... Daddy, I'm fucking you, I'm fucking you, I'm fucking your Mom..."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Yes, what, Daddy?" I slid up a little more and ran my tongue along his shaft up and down. "Yes, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me."</p> <p>"Yes, I am fucking your mother."</p> <p>He didn't say a word, but I could feel his heart beating through his chest. "Yes, daddy!" I took his cock in my hand and pressed my finger across his lips. "If you tell me to, I will."</p> <p>He smiled at the words, the desire, the challenge. "Yes, baby." I leaned forward and pulled his nipple into my mouth. I was so happy, I wanted to cry. I wanted him to cry, for both of us. But when he started to tremble, I took his face in my hands and kissed him. He tasted of salt and pepper, of sweat that had soaked into his shorts and shirt. "I was just thinking about how much my Mommy wanted you to do what we were going to do, when I got the call I think I'd lost control a bit."</p> <p>He smiled at his father. "I wanted to hear it."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"The 'we' where we were going to have sex, the 'what' we were going to do."</p> <p>He chuckled, I could tell he really liked the response. I felt he was enjoying it as much as I was. It made me happy to know. "Is that what the call was about?"</p> <p>I shook my head. "No. It was just...it being in the room in the room wasn't what I needed, being in there with all of us, but...well...I wanted it, too."</p> <p>"And what did you...want?"</p> <p>"I...I...I just..." I was cut off by his finger again, tracing my lips. I pulled his lips to mine and kissed him as I took his finger from his mouth. I ran my hand down his chest and reached between his legs, my hand cupping his cock, and pressed my palm against his groin. I felt his cock, hard and warm. I stroked my hand up and down. "I didn't want to stop you, but...."</p> <p>"But what?"</p> <p>"I know it's wrong but it doesn't mean what you think it meansâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
