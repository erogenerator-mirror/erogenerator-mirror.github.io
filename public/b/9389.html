This time was a bit more forceful and she responded to our kiss, her tongue searching out my mouth.</p> <p>We were both out of breath and getting a bit horny at that point. Before we had a chance to undress each other, I felt her hand sliding up my side and over my breast. I lifted my mouth off of hers, but she didn't let go. I looked over at the boys and saw that Jack was now stroking himself.</p> <p>I felt my hand slide down the soft back of her leg and into her panties, my middle finger sliding between her lips and rubbing her clitoris, eliciting a slight moan of pleasure. I couldn't believe these were the words that I had been waiting for. I couldn't contain myself so I pulled her onto the bed, straddled her, and lowered myself, sinking down on her so that I could kiss her lips.</p> <p>"We should do this every weekend," I said.</p> <p>She looked at me with a raised eyebrow.</p> <p>"Really? I don't know if I can. I mean it's summer and I'm here on vacation. I have no plans."</p> <p>"Well there isn't anything wrong with being naked in bed with you. I can assure you that."</p> <p>I lowered myself again, not wanting to take her virginity, but knowing that she'd have no problem taking mine. She was kissing me very passionately, her tongue exploring my mouth. I placed my hand on her head, feeling the soft, silky skin of her neck and shoulder, feeling her body against mine.</p> <p>"Let me make it better for you," I whispered to her, running my fingers through her hair. She looked at me for a few moments before kissing me again. I felt her warm tongue slide into my mouth. As we broke the kiss, we looked at each other and she pushed my head down so that I could suck on her breasts. They had a fine, roundness to them that was almost hypnotic.</p> <p>"Mmm, I love the feel of your mouth around me," she said. "You do that to me all the time. I haven't felt that in a long time," she said, giving my boobs a squeeze.</p> <p>While still kissing me, she reached between us, and grabbed my dick. I looked down at her.</p> <p>"You are a nice size," she said as she wrapped her fingers around my dick. She stroked it, trying to make it hard. "I think I can do better. You've only had one or two of these," she said as she cupped my balls, rolling those around her fingers as if in anticipation, which caused my dick to start throbbing. "Your cock is incredible."</p> <p>"I never knew you had a thing for big guys," I said with a laugh. "I'll say that I was looking forward to the opportunity to have you and a few other guys I know."</p> <p>"I have a lot of male friends to introduce you to," she said.</p> <p>Then she added, "It's getting to be a long weekend." With that, she moved up so that we were both on the bed and she was straddling me. Our bodies were now pressing against each other as she started kissing me again. She placed that hand on my chest, feeling the smooth, smooth-smooth skin of my bare chest.</p> <p>As if she wasn't going to stop kissing me, she slid her hand up my shirt, over my nipple, and stopped at mid-chest. Her thumb and fingers felt the tension she had earlier, and she slowly teased my nipple through my shirt.</p> <p>"If I get you to take off my top," she said, her voice sounding like a high-pitched scream in the air. I looked over to where I was sitting for a moment, watching her hand.</p> <p>"You'd better stop, or you'll really be in trouble," I said, with a grin on my face. She didn't laugh, but instead she leaned forward to kiss me again, this time even more passionately. Our mouths opened and our tongues were wrestling to get even deeper, deeper into each others mouths. My dick was rock hard and was pressing against her stomach. We continued exploring each others mouths, kissing, exploring.</p> <p>She broke our kiss, taking a step back so we could look at each other. "I haven't seen you like this in a while," she said.</p> <p>"Don't forget to bring us drinks too," I said, as I pointed to the ice bucket and two glasses in the corner. She went to go get them, but I grabbed her by the arm. "Just bring two glasses.
