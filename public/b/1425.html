There were no other sounds but two sets of footsteps.</p> <p>The man, who had to appear to be his late father, stood directly in front of them at the side of the door. "Donna, come in."</p> <p>It was a moment of silence that would not last for long. And as she walked into the tiny bathroom, it seemed to just be a short distance. She watched as the hand dropped from the knob of a door and disappeared into a narrow crevice.</p> <p>Her eyes followed the hand's progress into the hallway, watching for anything it might touch. For now, she let her eyes roam all over the man's body.</p> <p>The first step she made was to go to the sink. She felt the liquid on her hands as they worked the hand into her hands.</p> <p>Her hands came down, under her shirt, and she tried it. The warmth against her bare skin felt familiar, but not enough to satisfy her. But she went with it.</p> <p>Her hands rubbed slowly and delicately against her body. Her head lolled back, enjoying the softness of her own skin as the hand moved around her, finding a rhythm of her own.</p> <p>Her hand began the same pattern from the first step.</p> <p>She rubbed the body back and forth, first the chest, then the abdomen.</p> <p>Her mouth was dry again.</p> <p>She couldn't even speak.</p> <p>As she moved forward, her own pace changed. She was aware at least of the sound of the water rivulets as it ran over her skin. But she could barely make out the man's head, so she let up a little for a moment. Her hands went to her head again, and she began to brush the black hair as she reached back to rub it against herself, the sensation of her fingers rubbing against warm skin causing her own body to tremble.</p> <p>Her hands went to her front, feeling a momentary guilt at not taking her panties off under her skirt.</p> <p>But then she stopped.</p> <p>She pushed the hair back behind her and pushed her body down off the cold tile. More water rained on the bottom of the tub from her fingers and it ran along the inside of her fingers. It was like some kind of strange mixture of water that she hadn't noticed before, except it was warmer.</p> <p>She moved out of the shadows, toward the wall. She wanted to make sure that her breasts hadn't made a wet slapping sound.</p> <p>She turned her back to the mirror and slowly began to rub her shoulders. Her shoulders felt like she had been touched, and she had yet to see or feel anything else. She had to be careful to keep herself in a position that her arms didn't rub against her skin. She could feel the softness and hardness of her breasts as her arms moved against them. She wondered where they were exactly.</p> <p>She continued to rub her hands down her arms. The room went suddenly dark.</p> <p>...and she realized that her hands were on something.</p> <p>It felt strange for her to begin with, but she couldn't tell where it had come from, and so she went with it. She started rubbing her own body against herself. She thought of her father, and his hands in ways that she couldn't imagine, where they were touching hers. And that thought, alone, sent a shiver along her spine. It didn't matter that it was wrong, that she was only helping herself do something that had come from a stranger's hands.</p> <p>Her fingers moved faster now, trying to mimic the gentle movements of her own body. She knew that her fingers were moving against her own. Her breath was coming in short bursts. It felt so good.</p> <p>She felt a sudden shift in her own body. She reached up with her left hand and began rubbing herself through the wetness of her panties. Her panties were soaked now! It was like an underwater penis. It had felt so hard against her, yet so soft. But it wasn't hard enough for her hands to move in the water to reach the goal.</p> <p>Her hands moved upward, towards her pussy. She tried to imagine that it must be like a clitoris. She would imagine the tip of it pressing against her body.</p> <p>Her body, already on the verge of release, felt like it was on the verge of release itself. She tried to make the feeling go away, to move a little. Just a little bit of touch might be all it would take. But she found herself struggling against the slippery feeling of her own moisture, against it, against what her fingers were doing to her. How can so much of an act be good, she wondered, when it is so dirty against her bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
