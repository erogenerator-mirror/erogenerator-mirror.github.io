I asked her.</p> <p>'Well, it was your idea,' she replied.</p> <p>'So, you did not come to my rescue,' I replied.</p> <p>'I went with a young friend to an adult theatre, and she was just a quickie. She was really a nice girl, and we agreed that I may enjoy going there together.'</p> <p>'Who told you? I thought you were my friend,' I asked her.</p> <p>'Don't worry about the fact that I may fancy you,' she replied with a smile.</p> <p>When we got home I told him we would have to arrange the next week. I kissed her on her cheek and told him I was going to play the field.</p> <p>I took my mobile phone on that first night.</p> <p>I called a number and made the call. The girl must have known what she was doing. She was on the mobile when I spoke with her and introduced myself. She told me who's her friend and what she was looking for. I asked her, 'Have you spoken with these ladies?'</p> <p>'I did not know you in any way. I never knew your name or what you were looking for,' she replied.</p> <p>'You mean I can offer you flowers in gratitude. I will be ready for a little more than ten minutes,' I replied.</p> <p>I got to her place and took her flowers to her kitchen. I also kissed her on cheeks and told her I would make the coffee.</p> <p>When I left her place, there were three girls sitting around on the back of their lounge. One of the ones had tears in her eyes. The other one had a very long fingernail. I made the coffee, and after I washed it we sat at her table. The young lady there had asked us to sit next to her. She asked us to sit down on the sofa. There was a lot of silence, in fact I could hear about twenty men going in to buy coffee on the way to her front door. The other two girls sat there also.</p> <p>They were not shy though. Their faces showed their astonishment and apprehension, and also the excitement in their faces.</p> <p>I told them I was really pleased and pleased they were interested in me. I told them I already had a partner.</p> <p>'Why,' I asked the girl.</p> <p>'She is the only one I want to call,' she said.</p> <p>'How do you feel,' she asked shyly. She looked a little scared and scared not to talk with us.</p> <p>'I was expecting only men in the room,' I told her.</p> <p>'What do you meant?' she asked me.</p> <p>The man told us each was the next to the last person to come. So, a woman was available. One of the woman wanted us to take her into the bedroom, just in case someone was ready and willing to take the other girl into the bathroom.</p> <p>I told the girl to be ready for it, and she asked who would come first.</p> <p>The one sitting on the sofa took her first. She was wearing her hair in a bob cut that was now long. It looked like a short nightie. I took the man next to the girl and asked him to sit next to her. I also asked him to stay on the sofa. I told him he could sit next to her. That was the first time I touched her. I also got the man and himself on the sofa.</p> <p>We watched the movie together for half an hour. The lady, who had been waiting for hours, told us I was going to be her partner, and asked us to call her later. She also asked me to get her to sleep in a chair in the living room.</p> <p>The lady said she will be back in a minute to check that everything was in readiness for later. I went to the ladies' room to wash myself and took out the dress and left it on the clothes rack.</p> <p>The one sitting on the sofa asked me if I wanted me to go to the bathroom and wash myself. I said sure I would. She asked me to come behind the sofa. I got behind the sofa behind her. She asked me to close my eyes. I did so.</p> <p>She put her arms around my neck and pulled me down against her. She kissed me lightly on my lips and then said, 'I told you you are already my partner. So, this is not your first time.'</p> <p>I asked her if that was indeed your first time. She said yes I was so ready! She also asked me whether there was a special purpose which could bring about my first time. I said yes!</p> <p>She toldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
