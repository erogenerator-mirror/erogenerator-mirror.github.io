I said.</p> <p>He took a few steps over to me and smiled. "Oh, you have. That's so hot! Come over and sit by me when you're done."</p> <p>I shook my head. "I'm done. How could I, that's not how much you've ever been with a man before?" I said, trying to move away from him.</p> <p>He stopped. But he grabbed me and pulled me close. "And what is your name?"</p> <p>I shook my head. "Cora."</p> <p>"Cora, your first name is really important to me. You should have called me years ago. I could be in prison in the city." I paused briefly. "Well, my friends and lovers often called me that. Sometimes when I was not in a bar, when I came home, they called me that so...I...well, I guess we just got a little kinkier."</p> <p>I smiled at him, enjoying how I looked. I put both my hands behind my head and leaned forward. I closed my eyes and moved. I loved the feel of his hands holding me just as I loved the feel of his mouth on me. I let myself go.</p> <p>I felt his hands move toward my breasts, over my stomach and under me. His fingers played over the small bumps in my skin. I shivered and moaned when he made contact with my hardening nipples. His tongue licked them and his fingers tugged slowly. My clit stood up immediately. He bit in a small "O" and I jumped. He pulled my nipples gently into his teeth. The shock and shock ran through me. I felt myself come harder.</p> <p>His fingers went farther around my clit. It felt as if he were pulling it out a little; then he moved them back and back again. His fingers moved between my open legs and then I felt warm oil on my clit. It didn't take long. I started moaning and my body shook. His fingers pressed on, moving up and down as he moved on my body. His fingers on my clit felt like a little finger, sliding over me. I felt the tension of everything go away as he touched me inside. I closed my eyes and moaned deeply.</p> <p>He reached his hand down and picked me up in his arms. I lay back on the bed and took my panties off. My pussy didn't look bad, but this was just not what I was used to in the past, not to be called that. Now it looked different. I took them from him and threw them down on the bed. I lay there for a minute. His lips touched mine and I kissed him. Then he moved over me and began kissing down my body. His mouth went right to my pussy. I moaned each time his mouth touched me. He licked my lips and ran his tongue up and down them. I leaned up on the bed so my arms and leg were under me; just my legs were on top of the bed.</p> <p>He pushed my legs open. The head of his erection touched my opening. It slid in and I groaned. I loved that feeling.</p> <p>"Oh, you have a great pussy, Cora." he said as his hands ran up my body to cup my breasts. "That's the way I like to play."</p> <p>He slowly slid further into me. "I've always been glad you hadn't had the surgery!" he said as he entered me farther and farther.</p> <p>"That's it baby, let me please you more than you've ever done before." he said as he began to move into me. His lips touched me and when he touched me there I came immediately. I was almost on the edge. Then the pleasure was so intense I thought I'd come right then and there. But I quickly found that I did not climax; I just felt my body going off. I felt all the tension in my body go with that orgasm. And I'm sure that some of it must have been his finger up me. When I came back to earth and realized how happy I was looking at him I smiled.</p> <p>"I didn't think having a good fucking could be so good!" I said.</p> <p>"Well, I have plenty of good sex for you." he said.</p> <p>"I have more than enough for you," I said with a laugh.</p> <p>He pushed himself in me as deep as he could and pulled it out until just the head was in me. His grip on my breasts tightened suddenly and I let out a soft moan.</p> <p>"OH!" he said. "That really got you going."</p> <p>"Oh, you just did. Fuck me baby. I want you to fuck me hard." I saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
