You'll catch something with other then what's in the fridge. We can just come back tomorrow."</p> <p>"OK, but I'll be good for you. I have a new surprise coming up and don't want to put it off."</p> <p>"I'll just lock up. If you don't behave, we can do something tomorrow."</p> <p>"Deal."</p> <p>It was a little after seven when I woke up in the morning and saw that the room had a slight smell of sex. I got up and got ready and went outside and saw that they had made breakfast and it smelled like sex. I sat down and ate and looked at my phone. I had one of my fantasies. I would bring her back to my room, lay her down and go down on her. I could just touch her in the dark with one of my hands. I would take off my clothes and put her on all fours and fuck her with it. I imagined how hard was her tits and how wet she was being. I did a few shots in the dark. I came downstairs and went back to the bedroom where she was still asleep. I put my shirt on and went back to her and started rubbing her shoulders.</p> <p>"What are you doing? It's late and I'm late."</p> <p>"I'm trying to wake you up. You're hungry so it's fine with me."</p> <p>After a while with her lying on her back and the covers pulled up to her ears the rest of the morning wore on. I went to check the weather and found it to be warm, so I had to change back into my night shirt. It was cold. I took a shower and she got out of bed. We didn't even bother with the covers. She had on a tiny skirt and a pair of cotton panties. I was going to take a shower too.</p> <p>"I have a shower to go and go to. You can look at me and rub me."</p> <p>"I can't sleep because I want to fuck you."</p> <p>"I know but I'm not going anywhere until you are clean... for me."</p> <p>"I don't know but I'll think about it. We can just say that there isn't a chance."</p> <p>"I'm not going to put any clothes on until I'm clean. Now go do your thing and be sure to lock doors so that you have a key."</p> <p>She headed back to her room with my cum dripping down her panties. She left the door ajar and I was on the way to mine in my boxers. I didn't see her until she got out of the shower and looked in to see her standing there drying her hair.</p> <p>"Hi. I didn't think that you had a shower yet."</p> <p>"I'm so tired... My muscles just ache and I wish you were asleep so that I could fuck you. I want you to make me wet again."</p> <p>"I'm not done yet you horny pussy... I have plans for you, just watch."</p> <p>After her shower she said she needed to get ready and get out so I grabbed a few hours worth of my own stuff and drove home. I went right to bed thinking of how hot this is going to goâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
