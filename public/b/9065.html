I asked her.</p> <p>"I don't know why I do this" she said. "I'm so confused and hurt and angry. It's not fair how this all happened." She said sadly as she got off of my lap. "The sex with Mike wasn't really any big deal, it was the thing that was bothering me."</p> <p>"Oh really? What are you talking about?" I said.</p> <p>"I found out how he and I did it in the park. It was so dirty in there, I felt like I left a hole in him for months."</p> <p>She took my hand and slowly walked me to the door. I didn't see a way out.</p> <p>"I can't take the chance of you finding out that I fucked one of my brothers."</p> <p>"So, it wasn't you?" I asked as she closed the door.</p> <p>"No, not in the park. He didn't fuck me, I just thought it was to be friends." She started walking away as she grabbed her purse and her keys. On her way out she paused at the door and looked back at me. "I can't believe I let my brother and his friends leave me wanting what I don't have. I can't tell you why I let him take my father in his old Ford F150."</p> <p>"Oh my god, look at him!" I said as I grabbed her purse and keys and we headed towards her apartment. She drove as I drove. After a few minutes of walking I got her apartment number and went into her house. I knocked on the door and was greeted by a warm smile.</p> <p>"It's me. I'm glad I told you." She yelled to me as she pulled out of her driveway. I was met with a hug and kiss as we were introduced. She took me into the kitchen on my best friend’s suggestion. She made us two mugs of coffee and set them on the counter and sat down on one of my old wooden chairs.</p> <p>"What was that all about?" I asked.</p> <p>"You've known me too long now." She said smiling. "He told me that he wanted you the last time that we were together."</p> <p>"What have I gotten myself into?" I asked back to her.</p> <p>She started to laugh, "I love him more than anything." She said.</p> <p>"I guess I should start again." I said, "What are you so mad at me about?"</p> <p>"Oh I don't know. He is so good to me." She said as she took a drink from her mug. "I know that if you didn't have a lot of sex with other guys, we would get it on."</p> <p>"Look, don't go there!" I said shaking my head. "Maybe I can just forget about it and see if I can do better."</p> <p>"It doesn't really matter, don't you see?" She said pulling a piece of paper from her pocket. "This is your card. You can leave it alone while I decide what to do with you. Just give it to Mike for me. If he has questions then go right ahead. Maybe I'll even take it out on you."</p> <p>"That's a good idea." I said as I pulled my sweater up over my head and shook out my hair. "Can we go now?"</p> <p>"Yep, I guess we need to be ready for the day when these two are done for the day." She said as she took me by the hand and took my hand off the desk. She stood on the tarmac a few feet from me so that we were standing near a large metal cart that had been in the airport long before we arrived. We didn't know what to do. In front of us were two older women walking down a dirt road full of old wooden benches. One was wearing a white sleeveless top and shorts. She had on shorts that really showed off her legs. I had the feeling that the two of them were probably waiting for me. I'm sure that neither of them cared.</p> <p>"I'm here!"</p> <p>We heard a low voice from behind them. "Are you girls waiting out there for a ride." The man wearing the hat nodded to his friends and walked down the aisle. As we reached the end of the long dirt road, the woman that we both suspected had the best leg of her long, straight brown hair gave me a strange look. She was wearing sunglasses that matched a white long sleeved shirt that was almost transparent. I could make out her eyes and what must be long, blonde hair that tied into a pony tail. She walked up to us and waved. We waved back.</p> <p>While the men were talking to their friends, the other two women walked down the dirt—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
