I moaned into the sheets.</p> <p>The fingers slipped out, and then the thumb took over again, sliding effortlessly into my wetness. It was so different, and I realized at that stage that my arousal was more than mere sexual pleasure; I was completely aware of my aroused state.</p> <p>"Your ass is the hottest place on earth!"</p> <p>"No really," I replied, my voice a bit soft. In this moment, I was truly enjoying myself, and I felt ashamed by my admission. If it were a normal place to be, then I would have enjoyed it so.</p> <p>"Why, um, I didn't know... I mean I..."</p> <p>"Your secret's safe with me," I smiled, "just relax and enjoy, you know?"</p> <p>I felt the fingers return, slowly, ever so slowly, inside. They were so very, very thick! I moaned louder and louder as they began to sink further inside of me. The tips of the digits brushed against my g-spot, and my hips began to move a little off the bed to allow them more room.</p> <p>"Oh, it's a really good feeling!" I exclaimed, "How does it feel... to feel something like that."</p> <p>This time, the fingertips penetrated my wetness deeper, even deeper. And I could feel it... actually touch my vaginal entrance. A little push and the fingers went inside of my tightness. It was really nice, and I was ready.</p> <p>"You're already so wet," I heard whispered in my ear, "how does it feel?"</p> <p>"Oh it feels great!" My voice was husky again, almost a whisper, "It feels perfect to touch - everywhere - everywhere!"</p> <p>Again and again my fingers pressed inward, exploring my pussy further and more with each stroke. As a few fingers slipped through my anal opening, they slid in smoothly, and then they were gone. When they reentered the moist walls of my pussy, it felt so incredible that I couldn't hold back. My breathing became heavier, and my whole body quivered. I closed my eyes and breathed in to get my oxygen.</p> <p>"Shit! I'm cumming!"</p> <p>Just being with other people's intimate parts at this time and that kind of thing makes it a bit different, I smiled, and then I opened my eyes and stared at my naked body. I felt so free - so free from any inhibitions of any kind. It was amazing!</p> <p>"Oh, shit! Look at me, Michael! Come here!" I leaned back and took a good look at me. My eyes widened in shock and my heart began to beat rapidly. I felt a small bit of disappointment - that I'd cum while someone's hand was inside of me, but a lot more of a good feeling. I felt proud, and I felt sexy!</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I breathed, "I thought..."</p> <p>"No you didn't!" I heard myself say, "you needed to cum. That's where I belong!" I felt like I was a naughty girl, and I had no inhibitions left.</p> <p>"Oh, sorry," I whispered even more softly as I took another step forward, "It's ok. It doesn't really hurt. I love you."</p> <p>"I love you, too," I said, "now I know how I feel!"</p> <p>"Me too!" I heard myself whisper, and then I realized that I'd heard a quiet, yet sexy, "me" again.</p> <p>"But... now that I want to be with you - I think I'd rather not feel like I've just been... violated."</p> <p>"Please don't feel like that," I said, "I'm a good girl."</p> <p>"I know," was all he said to me.</p> <p>I closed my eyes, and then sighed gently, and then leaned my head back and sighed.</p> <p>"Oh," I sighed, "that felt good..." I sighed again a little longer as another thought started to move through my body. It was the thought of something very deep and meaningful, something very personal. "I just wonder what it would feel like to be with a man in a bed!"</p> <p>We lay very still for a moment, and then I said, "I still need to talk about everything with him... but I think we should do this right."</p> <p>"Oh, I agree," he beamed, "you have no idea. But don't feel too bad - you're doing so well - just let's talk about it."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I asked him, "I feel so happy right now.
