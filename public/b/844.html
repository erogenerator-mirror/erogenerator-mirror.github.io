I had been working hard, getting into all of the old business, but it seemed that there was no end to the hours at the local coffee shop, and the coffee itself was like drinking water. The only perk that I was proud of was the fact that the shop was full of old friends and we could do most anything together. There were so many of the old-time business going from the shop floor to the office door. There was always time for some fun.</p> <p>Sitting in the office and feeling pretty good about myself, I was just about to begin the day when the phone rang. We were on a quick lunch trip and would have to go home, but I didn't want to take a chance of interrupting.</p> <p>"Hello, John?" I said with a smile.</p> <p>"Good morning! How are you? I'm in town on an overnight business trip," answered his voice as if he were an old professor who'd asked me a question.</p> <p>I smiled and told him that my trip ended last night and that I was about to take him out to dinner again the next day. I hoped that he'd like to see my new 'little business' again and then he and I could catch up.</p> <p>"Why haven't you come around to my place, John? What have you been up to this morning?" he asked.</p> <p>"I haven't been all that far, really! It's a pleasure to be able to go all of the way up there with you."</p> <p>I laughed again and told him, "Well the whole purpose is to have a place to be."</p> <p>With that I hung up the phone and told him, "I've made a great little business acquaintance."</p> <p>After I did that my thoughts suddenly switched to a different side of him. John was very much a stranger. He had come on to me one afternoon in the morning, telling me about this house, and I asked him about it, and what he had done about it and what plans he had for it. He told me many things that it hadn't quite been, but I know that I knew that it had been quite something. In fact, the next time that I saw him I could see when he stood at the counter and saw that he was a tall man. He was a very attractive man.</p> <p>In an effort to keep this from happening too soon, I asked him, "John, what happened the other day?"</p> <p>He looked at me for a long minute as if he was considering having a serious discussion. Finally he looked down into his glass and said, "I don't know about anything, S. I don't know anything about anything either. Just tell me the name of the house."</p> <p>"I didn't exactly need to call it the house," I told him. "The real difference is that it's much nicer around here and is not a busy place to get all kinds of supplies for the next hour. So, why don't you call it it an afternoon. We'll keep going straight into town and have a good time."</p> <p>He agreed that we didn't need to go all that far so I could go and get myself something to eat, but I still asked John to do me a favor. So, after he got off the phone I looked at myself in the mirror and thought of how I would wear it.</p> <p>The night before, I hadn't worn anything but a thin pair of short gym shorts that were just a little too small for my body. As I approached the counter I saw a very attractive man standing there. It wasn't hard to guess that he wanted to talk to me, and since I could see that he had a rather good body, I took my time in looking at his body. I had no trouble finding it a pleasure to stand around like that, and I could see that his eyes were as riveted on me as I was on him because the tight fitting shorts only emphasized the muscles in his arms and shoulders.</p> <p>Sitting down in the chair that he had vacated, I felt a moment of uncertainty as to whether or not I should say what I was thinking. Then I remembered that I knew exactly the right thing to say to make him feel as much as he was feeling about me. I said it anyway," John, I just wanted you to know that I'm always here for you. That's all."</p> <p>He smiled down at me and said, "Well, now that you mention it I'm not sure how much longer I can stay there again."</p> <p>"Yeah, I get that a bit," I agreed. "It was nice of you to invite me anywayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
