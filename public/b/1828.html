I've got to warn you, there's a girl you're all for in the next room."</p> <p>"I thought you said she was married. I don't get the impression she has one either."</p> <p>I knew I had no way to turn him down.</p> <p>"Well, she hasn't asked for my name. I don't know anything about being married. We were married when my kids were born."</p> <p>"So is your husband the one at school?"</p> <p>"He's my best friend and she is my boss."</p> <p>"Does she know your husband, though?"</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"I'll bet. What's her name?"</p> <p>"Oh, I don't think that's going to be a problem, I haven't been in her room in...what... thirty..."</p> <p>"Just call her."</p> <p>"How come you don't have the keys to her room?"</p> <p>"She's my lover," I said, not wanting to sound too desperate, despite knowing that, at least, he might have. "So what's she wearing?"</p> <p>He looked at me for a few seconds then smiled. "I've got her all to myself here and, she's a complete piece of work. I'll keep her."</p> <p>"And the clothes?" I asked him, trying to distract him from the fact that he had gotten away from me all this time with another woman.</p> <p>"All of her clothes are all yours."</p> <p>"No, we're not really going to...this is just...this is just...." I stammered.</p> <p>"This is just sex, remember?" he said.</p> <p>"Oh, my God!" I was almost laughing when I finally finished saying it. "So you're the one that bought her out?" I could only hope he hadn't seen the look on my face.</p> <p>"She's not you," he said with a shrug, showing that he wasn't completely flustered or hurt. "My wife's a friend of mine. We haven't been intimate in over seven months."</p> <p>"So you're all dressed up for her?" It was almost a question, but I tried to remain calm. If he had been angry, he probably would have taken it in stride.</p> <p>"No," Jim said, with a grin. "Not yet. We've got to get away from here before your wife finds out about this or we'll ruin it for you."</p> <p>"And what does that have to do with us?"</p> <p>Jim smiled back. "This is going to change our lives. For the next five days and into every day of all this. You're only a toy for me, baby." He leaned toward me and took me in his arms again, planting a kiss on my lips. His hands dropped to my ass and he squeezed it roughly.</p> <p>"You'll like this part," he said, his smile growing with every kiss I offered him. "We're not gonna have much time to ourselves."</p> <p>"Yeah," I sighed. "We just going to have to get to know each other better, then."</p> <p>Jim gave me one more gentle shove so I was now standing against the wall. Then it hit me how big of a mistake this all was. I was not afraid to be kissed for some strange reason. I looked over at him, but he was so close he seemed to be looking straight down at me.</p> <p>"Don't look at me like that. I'm in my office. So get to your feet and put these things away and then put the clothes back on!"</p> <p>I stepped away and turned to go back into the building. Jim stopped me by taking the leash from my hand.</p> <p>"Not just yet, I think," he said as he walked me to the elevator and, with one final pat of my ass, started to go in a direction where he would find the room. When he stood outside, I was just beginning to hope the elevator wouldn't start moving again.</p> <p>"Oh, shit," I thought to myself as I felt the chain leash loosen its grip on my hands.</p> <p>Jim had left the elevators running all night. It was getting dark outside as I tried to get the nerve to walk past him. It must have been a mistake because Jim was behind one of the doors in the elevator when I finally got there. He was sitting in the middle of the back row of men's restrooms in a corner of the hotel.</p> <p>"I saw you come in," he said. "That's what made the key."</p> <p>"I was getting a wash for the coffee," I said sarcastically, as if I was the one that had gotten away.</p> <p>"You're not finished?" he asked, turning to me before returning his attention to the floor.</p> <p>Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
