That smile could give a model a great picture.</p> <p>"I didn't get your name, did I?" he said, laughing.</p> <p>"Nope," she giggled. "But, I do like to picture it."</p> <p>He laughed again. "Then what does that got to do with anything? Are you getting off on this little game?" he said.</p> <p>It did, but for a fraction of a second her look changed. She smiled and lifted her bottom a little. From where he was crouched, he could see the shadow of her inner thigh. That gave him a glimpse of her pubic hair. She reached back and touched his belly. "You like it?" she asked.</p> <p>"Of course," he said. "You have a gorgeous body."</p> <p>"Really," she said. "I had never heard of a guy with a really good one."</p> <p>"Well, they're nice," he said, smiling. She leaned forward and ran her tongue across his lips. It was long and slow. He tasted a bit of her and was surprised at the taste of it on his tongue. She lifted her mouth off his. "Is that better?" she said in a sultry voice.</p> <p>He smiled and she turned around. Then she came up for him. "Ready?" she said as her feet went around the chair. The skirt fell up her legs. He caught a glimpse of what they had in the way of panties before she sat back down on him, straddling him again. "Better?"</p> <p>"It's great," he said.</p> <p>"I hope I can do it again," she said, reaching up and stroking his penis. As soon as he felt it touch her, she started to slide up and down on him. He was a bit nervous about doing it, since he'd never had a girl do it to him in the missionary position. And he couldn't imagine doing that in a car.</p> <p>"How about if I give you a blow job?" she said.</p> <p>He reached up a little. "Doing what?"</p> <p>"Getting you off. Getting some of that sweet cum out of your cock." His hands were on her waist, pulling up her top. He tried to imagine her breasts dangling free and free for him to touch. "What do you want to do?" she said, lifting herself off he.</p> <p>"How about if I gave you a kiss and a little feel?"</p> <p>"How about if I took that pretty little white hand off your cock so I could do for you what I could do for you." She kissed his cheek.</p> <p>"Okay," he said.</p> <p>To prove how good his cock was, she straddled him again and held it against her. He brought his hands to her hips and she pushed herself against them.</p> <p>It was a strange sensation. He had expected it to be a lot of work to do. "Oh!" she said as his fingers touched her slit. She wasn't too wet yet, but she was slippery and wet. He began to rub her. It didn't take long. "Oh!" she gasped and leaned forward.</p> <p>She kissed him, then looked up at him. He smiled as he began to stroke her neck. "Don't just sit there," she said and leaned forward. Her lips met his. The kiss started off slowly. It was gentle, slow, but there was a deep passion. She kissed him, and opened herself a little before pulling back a bit. Her tongue found his and they were soon exploring each other.</p> <p>Suddenly, he had a better idea how he would get the job done. He slid one hand away from her hips and grabbed her ass. He moved a little closer in the chair. His cock, now fully erect, was right in front of her face. He couldn't believe it, and even with both hands in control over himself, he was surprised to feel the head of it on the inside of her cheek.</p> <p>"Oh!" she cried. "That's good!"</p> <p>He moved his knees forward. As they did, his cock was touching her cheeks. Slowly, they both moved off the chair and onto her bed. She lay before him on her back. He knelt between her legs. She put one foot up on the bed and wrapped her fingers around his member. Slowly he slid his entire erection inside her. "Wow!" he said. "Feels good!" she said as she began to stroke him up and down.</p> <p>He leaned forward a bit and kissed her mouth. She sucked his tongue. It felt fabulous. He had always loved giving each other's tongues. It excited him all the more. He started moving her faster. "Oh! Oh! OOOOOOO! That feels so good!" she criedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
