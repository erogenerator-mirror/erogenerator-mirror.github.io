You know who I mean." She said before she had a chance to add a full sentence.</p> <p>"Hi, I'm Lace! Nice to meet you. I'm going to bed now, and can sleep for 20 hours. How are you staying for such an interesting and exciting trip?" I wondered about all of this as I stood in the doorway. What did she mean by "interesting and exciting" as in "lairing"?</p> <p>"That sounds good. We'll be sleeping tomorrow with our new room and the couch," she added to make a point.</p> <p>I was still a bit confused by it all. She had never told me anything like this before, or asked if I would like to try it.</p> <p>"Yeah, maybe we can share the bed in a little bit. It's not so bad, is it?" my wife commented in a nonchalant way. This would be her chance to share some real intimacy with me. She had never been unfaithful before, but she was certainly not about to tell me that the way I had fantasized would be "dirty", or that I would actually take part in her "sex". Did she still feel that way about me and how I had responded? Her willingness to make it something that she enjoyed with others would be a bonus. No need to try to explain to her, I thought, she really was the sexiest and most sexually sensual woman I had ever known.</p> <p>I could tell that she was thinking about this with every word of my offer. It was exciting the way her excitement went up and down. She was having an exciting dream of us both sleeping next to naked each of the next morning. I looked down at her, trying to read this to make sure it was sincere.</p> <p>She was looking at me as though she was considering it with her eyes. She had told me to be careful, in case it scared me. But, she obviously was considering it with her eyes. I could tell she loved that it scared her. At last she would let me do whatever I wanted with her.</p> <p>But I was beginning to worry that she might be not quite so sure of it.</p> <p>"It doesn't have to be all that far away, is it? I'll go ahead and sleep it off then," I suggested. This may be more than I expected but it still seemed to be a bit odd to her. It also showed that it was not so much going to a bed and a couch in her room for me and the bed in ours, but more likely to the rest of our room. This was the second time I had told her about it. I smiled at that thought.</p> <p>She nodded as though she was considering what I had suggested. I didn't know what she was thinking; she was obviously really thinking about trying it all. "OK. I'll take the bed," she offered.</p> <p>"No! That's not possible, you're not even naked! It's not right that you are not naked, but I just said I'm not going to share the bed. Plus the couch doesn't exactly suit you." I told her as I was about to point this out.</p> <p>She looked shocked at me as I looked at her. "No, I'm the one in agreement. It's just that I think you look good with this sleeping bag over you."</p> <p>This time I was going full out on it. "Thank you for coming to my rescue with me. I have a sneaking suspicion I will sleep out here naked with you." I said as if it was the most natural thing in the world.</p> <p>Looking back at me, she got a thoughtful look on her face. "I agree with you. I have a sneaking suspicion that you might sleep with me, but not as naked as I do." I had to agree. This seemed like a good time to go for broke. I was going to have to put my plan in motion now if I really wanted to get to know her better.</p> <p>"OK. Come on then," I offered. "We can snuggle for the night, or if you wish, I'll sleep with the bed." That was all I had had to say. I was going to get her back for that.</p> <p>She looked back at me as though she didn't believe me. "OK. Then why don't we snuggle. It would be the best way to wake up."</p> <p>"Well, if you want to stay here with me, I would love to sleep with you." I smiled at the way she seemed to think I meant it, and I hoped I did not scare her. This might also be our last chance to see one another in the daylight.</p> <p>"I think you are correct," she admitted. She was actually thinking this through very wellâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
