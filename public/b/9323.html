I think she was. Her skirt stopped right at the bottom of her thigh. If she'd let me look, I'm sure I'd have found my eyes staring right at her pussy. I swear I heard her make sure she didn't notice my staring when she turned again. Then, after a minute or two, she leaned her right tit in my face and put it in my mouth. That was the moment I finally decided. Or was it?</p> <p>I knew I'd been staring at her for some time, because she smiled and moved again. At first, I didn't notice, and then, I actually had a clear view of her ass. And, my face got hot, especially when she started to rub it and get it into her ass. Then, she slowly moved her right leg over mine, with one knee on each arm of the chair. When she was facing me, she took my right hand from my cock and put it on her thigh, right above the knee on her left leg. Then, she put her right hand on both sides of mine and squeezed them together.</p> <p>I started stroking her, at first with just my right hand, and then with two, so I could feel the tension in her knee. Her body moved in response to my touch, too. In a few minutes, she started to rub her pussy over my hand. Oh, yeah. I got a quick image of her rubbing me and I was pretty sure I might have a hard time holding off cumming again.</p> <p>Then, I looked down to see that her right breast was inches from my face. I was already having trouble stopping if I even tried. "Oh, yeah," she said. "You're getting a hard-on again." So I looked back up at her before she finished saying that. The first time she had said that, I felt it, she said it. I could tell that it was getting darker in the room. And, she could tell that it was getting more and more obvious on my face, too. She kept saying, "You like the way I feel, don't you?" and the next minute, each time I looked over at her, she looked down. And, then, she did that, too. When she looked over, she moved a bit closer to me. Then, she went back to touching herself right there on the chair.</p> <p>When she got a little closer, I reached between my legs and started stroking my cock. "Look," she ordered. "It's not that uncomfortable. And, it's a lot easier when you're close." "What do you mean?" I asked.</p> <p>She looked over and said, "Watch it. If you like, just rub it. I love rubbing it." I tried to move my hand over my cock, which was just as hard as I was a little while ago. It took a few minutes for me to get the idea, then, I just did what she wanted. "Yeah, that's easy," she said, and she started stroking it faster. After a few minutes, I felt that familiar feeling. It was like the sensation of someone else doing it to me, and I wanted to get the reaction so I could say, "I can't believe it's working!" before I came. It was a very good feeling and I'm sure it was a pretty good feeling for her if I didn't try to hold off. She just kept going, saying, "You're like this!" in return every time. Then, she put her hand around my shaft, got her hand up, and started stroking.</p> <p>At first, I was kind of stunned by how hot that felt. It was a different kind of heat, I suppose, that I don't remember seeing come up out of the water. But, at the same time, if I didn't know better, I wondered about that. Then, I got my hand up and started stroking my dick, just as soon as I figured it out. She didn't even need to say anything; she was still rubbing her pussy over my palm like she did the first time, so it didn't make a difference. She didn't think she was doing anything with her hand any more than she was with mine.</p> <p>I think she came a few times, too. I was surprised by her ability to still be able to hold it off, but her hand really did work, too. Just at the end of my second orgasm, I had to stop and stroke myself some more, too. It didn't bother me anymore. Then, she climbed back in the chair, sitting a little ways in front of me. This time, she made sure my dick was right in front of her face, and then she put her left hand under the edge of the chair.
