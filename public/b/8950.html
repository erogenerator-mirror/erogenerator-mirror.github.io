"So you'll be my slave?" she whispered over her shoulder.</p> <p>A deep growl vibrated through his chest and she saw stars. She felt the first strike, and he flicked out his hand, which sent something sharp to the inside of her thigh.</p> <p>"You will stay like this!" he growled. He whipped her again with his hand and she winced. His hand kept circling, circling, circling, circling. She knew instinctively that he was going to use his hand to hurt her, and she couldn't tell how far he wanted to push it. She knew what she wanted—to be spanked again, hard, and she did it.</p> <p>He pulled up on her hair, and she felt a tug through his fingertips as he pressed firmly through the silk scarf. She looked forward, seeing the moon above his hand, and he gave her another stinging stripe from the edge of the whip down over her leg and her other leg. He whipped the other up. She whimpered, but held on. When he moved his head around a bit, she knew what a shock, when he would let her go completely.</p> <p>"Do you want to get off one ankle and go into the bedroom?"</p> <p>She wanted to tell him no, but somehow didn't know what to say. She wasn't ready. He smiled down at her, and she realized she needed a bit of a convincing. She looked up at his face—tense, determined, a look she hadn't seen for a long time.</p> <p>"Yes, master." she said it out loud in her head, but he wouldn't hear her.</p> <p>"Yes what, slave?" he demanded.</p> <p>"Yes, master."</p> <p>She heard the smile in his voice. "Then go immediately, you silly wench."</p> <p>And she did. He'd whipped her so far, she had a headache to deal with. She'd got herself off in one move. How could this be? she thought. She remembered his touch. He'd been right on target. When the belt struck her, her body went numb. She remembered the heat on her skin, the sting, his fingers brushing her breasts, the pain. And finally, when she thought she couldn't feel anything—she couldn't even make an effort to make her breathing slow down—he whipped her a bit harder, pulling the hair of her back a little on a strap and sending her tumbling back down onto her heel. She couldn't help feeling the burn from her wrists against the back of the chair as he landed. She tried to hold on, but it was no use. Her entire body was aching.</p> <p>"That's good, slave," he said.</p> <p>He let her go from time to time and she realized that he was in control of herself. Her mind was clouded with pain.</p> <p>"No, no, don't stop, it's too much," she tried to beg. He shook his head. "No slave. It's too much for me to give you a chance to fight the feelings. You're mine now and this is all mine." He'd told her that she'd be the slave she wanted to be, not him. There'd been a time. He had told her he'd like to take her over his knee, and she'd gone willingly and he'd stopped her from doing that. He'd enjoyed making her. But as if it couldn't have been more right, he'd had the balls to bring her back on the ground where she belonged. She could have stopped him if he'd stopped, which she probably couldn't have done, but he hadn't.</p> <p>"Go put your clothes on and meet me upstairs," he told her as he stood up. He kissed her on the cheek gently, and he watched her as she stepped out, her face red and flushed, her hair tumbling about her shoulders as she hurried to the stairs. She didn't hurry.</p> <p>When he was out of earshot, he said, "There's not a minute's rest that is going to pass tonight, I know that." And he left the room.</p> <p>She went to the basement. She knew where she could get a bit of relief. She went to the door and let herself in. He was naked once more, and she was pleased at the way he looked. He was tall and thin, and he must work out. His body was muscled, strong. As much as she enjoyed looking at it, she was in awe of the fact that he was a male. He was pretty, for sure.</p> <p>She saw how his eyes were fixed on hers. He smiled. His eyes were wide with curiosity. She felt the same way, and he had that smile that always—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
