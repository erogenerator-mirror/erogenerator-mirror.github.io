By then, I knew this young white boy wasn't going to stop, and he certainly hadn't asked permission. The next day, he asked me to marry him and gave me his handkerchief for this trip: a beautiful white man gave me the handkerchief when we walked out the door.</p> <p>It made me feel better to know that I was the son of a wealthy white family, as you might imagine, and that all white families are really nice. I did that a lot, as I had many, many black brothers and sisters, and a lot of them were young and pretty. Of course they made a lot of money for themselves, and I did well with that, for it really wasn't like me to do everything just for myself, especially when it came down to it. I was glad that I had my dad come from a wealthy family in the South.</p> <p>So after all that, our life together was very exciting. The wedding came down to an auspicious occasion when the Reverend Martin came out to the church. He was the best man there, and we had our first marriage at that wedding. My dad gave a big speech, and the whole congregation went to him. The preacher was a nice-to-all, and he wasn't in a bad way with most people. The pastor, who wasn't my father, had a great big talk with Father John, who was white, and he was absolutely amazing, and it got around to other activities at the church. Martin's father was the biggest of the bunch, and he made a great preacher. The whole thing was very eventful, even with the preacher getting me drunk, being drunk with him, and then, the preacher putting a condom on me and screwing me to keep it that way for a long time.</p> <p>Martin's father looked so sweet and funny, and he looked really good in a suit, which had a lot of money. He had a big smile on his face when he showed me the ring. It was beautiful, and my dad had given me it when I was little, so I think I liked it too. I remember thinking to myself that I loved him with all of my heart, and I felt very happy to have him with me that night. I couldn't say that I actually loved Martin, only that I very much liked him and had to be with him often. I always had to admit that I was beginning to feel very feminine, just by having a man in my life.</p> <p>The wedding was very nice, even if I only attended it for the first time, not to the wedding itself! As it turned out, Martin didn't even go to the reception of the preacher, and it wasn't really a reception. Our family came down to the reception first, and we were all glad to be there. Then, Martin's parents went back to get their things, and Martin's dad came down with us, which, by the way, we used to do when Martin's folks were there. This was where things started to happen, which means, I can just keep saying this about myself. I guess you can just forget what I said and go back on about other times. Anyway, my parents and Martin's parents came out the door, and he was at the dinner table, and Martin's brother, and it really looked like one of those wedding receptions, with all of Martin's family.</p> <p>I remember being very happy when I arrived, and my first husband came back to say he was going to go to Florida without me, and Martin's dad said he should go anyway. He asked us to come down for a while to see him, and we did, for the whole evening. We drank and danced a lot to music we had never heard before in real life. By the end of the evening, I was feeling much better with Martin, and his father and brother. All of us liked Martin very much, and his parents even seemed to be having a good time.</p> <p>Now, I know that we all really liked Martin very much, even with my dad and brother. He was a cool smart and sweet boy, and a very nice man. And like all white guys, he was very protective of me and never treated me lightly. That was just fine with me, even if Martin was always at my Dad's side constantly.</p> <p>I'm sure it was nice to hear from all of you, and I hope you all had fun, even though I did. I'm glad that we got back to the house when our parents were at home, and then we knew what the night was like with Martin and his family, and the way it went. The preacher was nice and sweet and nice and all of those things, too. I felt so happy that I wanted to keep Martin as my lover.</p> <p>On the wedding night, I feltâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
