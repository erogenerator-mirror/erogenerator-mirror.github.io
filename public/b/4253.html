He held himself still as he began to move and she moved in and out of his body with renewed intensity and she came.</p> <p>"I've always loved you," she said as he kissed her again.</p> <p>"There is so much more we can do together, please, be here when it is ready."</p> <p>"Well..." she said, she kissed him again, more fervently this time, and then they lay there in silence, both enjoying the new day of sex and the feelings that came to the surface.</p> <p>They did not speak until early the next morning when she awoke with a start, and then she turned her head around to look over at Frank as he was coming home. "Well?" she asked.</p> <p>He took her in his arms and kissed her deeply. "It's not as I thought it would be," he replied.</p> <p>"Oh, yes it is," and she smiled at him and then kissed him back.</p> <p>She began to undress him, and when she had him naked she began to kiss the inside of his thighs again.</p> <p>"There is something else I want you to do," she said.</p> <p>She took the end of his penis in her hand and began to lick around the head slowly. Her technique was different, she licked at the opening of him for a while then took him in her mouth. She then sucked gently on him and began to move her head up and down slowly. She moved just the large head in and out of her mouth, then up the shaft, and finally down on him. As she sucked him off she also pushed one finger into the tight opening of her body, rubbing, and caressing inside her. When she came to her husband's penis she slid down on it, she could feel the length of him as she slid down on him. Now she felt the head of his penis nudging the front of her, she pushed down on him and moved her body as she took him as deep as she could and then she moved again up and down on his penis.</p> <p>He began moving his hips from side to side in order to meet her as she pulled herself up on him. "Fuck me," he said as he grabbed her by the buttocks and began to thrust upwards.</p> <p>"Please," she asked between sucks.</p> <p>"What the..."</p> <p>"Fuck me!"</p> <p>"Please, Frank, do it," she cried.</p> <p>"What the fuck," he said. "What I've always wanted to do, but never dared dream could make me do." She put her hand to his mouth and told him to keep it away if she did not do that in a minute.</p> <p>He gave her a few more slow thrusts then he rolled her onto her back to get the better position. He moved his penis between her legs to slip it into her and she was already taking his penis into herself so that when he thrust up he entered her completely.</p> <p>They were both so ready now. They were not talking but their hands were all over each other. "Let me suck your dick," she said.</p> <p>Frank pulled himself up off of her and lay next to her on his back. They lay there in silence as their sex continued, they seemed so close now, she could feel the warmth and wetness flowing out, even though he had stopped thrusting.</p> <p>"Please," she begged. "I want to make love to you now. Please." Frank did not think so and he pulled her on top of him, got her legs spread apart and began to kiss and lick her body. She could feel his face against her stomach and her hands were on his shoulders as they lay there. She began to undress him, kissing his back as he got to his feet and she let him pull her into his arms, his penis was standing against her pussy and she began to move in rhythm with him.</p> <p>"I'm not sure you should be doing this", she said as she reached to the night table and took out a little foil packet. He felt his penis begin to swell again as she began to wrap it around his penis and with it she put it to one side before she pushed herself down onto it again.
