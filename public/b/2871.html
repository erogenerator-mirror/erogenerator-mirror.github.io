My daughter answered. She was in her little brother's room and I was talking to her. "Your mother?"</p> <p>I said, "Yes. My husband is away at the time of the funeral. Why?"</p> <p>"My son is in the Air Force in Iraq and he needed to be home for this. I'm not sure where he is. He said that he has to go to the Middle East, the Middle East, but he wasn't sure. Did you know that your husband was in Iraq too?"</p> <p>I replied, "I know. I'm just not sure right now where he is. He left on the last leg of the plane before leaving."</p> <p>"My husband is in another land. I'm sorry. Do you remember how hard it was for me not to be able to tell the person my husband was in Iraq?"</p> <p>"I have a feeling that it has been a while since he talked to you. He has been away from me for awhile now."</p> <p>"Can you talk me through this for me. When I'm done with you, do you want me to call you?"</p> <p>"I would really like that." My wife responded without a hint of hostility or guilt. She was in my old favorite zone. My daughter. I could tell. She was excited about the possible trip to a remote location. She has a strong love for the Middle East.</p> <p>"How long would it take me for me to get up the nerve to call you?"</p> <p>There was an impish smile on my wife's face when she asked, "How much? How long do we have to wait for you?"</p> <p>I replied, "I was just thinking about how much it would cost me to call and see if a plane could fly me to the Middle East, just you and I can talk about it."</p> <p>"Ok. I'll let you know as soon as we decide."</p> <p>When the caller was finished I was curious to hear what the conversation would be about. Did my wife actually have a boyfriend or just a lover, who had a wife and an ex-husband and they all wanted to talk about something else besides his home life? Maybe my daughter really wasn't too smart with her looks? Had I missed some crucial detail about how my wife and my daughter would live with us in our new house because of our trip? I could hear my wife making sounds of enjoyment the other end of the telephone.</p> <p>I did hear her say something about moving to England when I stopped the story. I could tell by the tone of her voice that she was excited to be doing something out of her heart. And I certainly was. I didn't know how much distance I was leaving in my home country. That was a risk I had no intention of taking.</p> <p>I asked her how old she was. She didn't answer her question though and I heard a rustling of a drawer and a sound of something dropping on the floor. Then the phone was silent.</p> <p>Again I heard my wife's words, "I think I need to get up the nerve to tell the people your husband is in Iraq."</p> <p>I had the best day of my life with a friend of mine who was working for a security company. His name was Roger Davenport. I had seen him around several times on the trip. I knew him a little. We met when I asked him out for a drink. He was a handsome man. A good looking thirty-five year old stockbroker with short black hair. He was an impressive looking man. I tried not to get in the way of this lovely woman having a good time with someone she was seeing and who seemed like I was too. That didn't help me much. She asked me out once before. It seemed like a long time ago.</p> <p>While the caller was still in his office and I was making a decision to call my wife, I heard the tell tale sounds of her sex. So I went with it and waited for the call to continue. There was a silence. I listened to the voice of my best friend and that is all I remember. I didn't say anything. I really didn't know if this would go any furtherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
