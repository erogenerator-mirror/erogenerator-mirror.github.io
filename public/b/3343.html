We walked to the house and I kissed her as she kissed me back. She took my hand and we walked to the patio. I turned around to show her my back while she turned around and showed me her bottom. I held her by her hips against me so she could feel my erection pressing against her. "You really have to get ready to go out."</p> <p>"I'm taking a shower," she said, "and I'll meet you downstairs in the dining room."</p> <p>I turned towards the bathroom to get ready to go on the patio while she washed her hair and got ready to go down? "Not a chance," I said quickly.</p> <p>"Wait a half hour," she said as I got out of the shower and opened the door and waited for her to go with me. She came out in a towel and we went down to the kitchen. The house smelled like breakfast and it smelled like she had been drinking coffee or a hot chocolate.</p> <p>Once we got the bacon out of the stove, she stood and held out her hand to show me her backside. I wrapped her into a towel while we made a plate while making toast. By the time we had finished, she was fully naked with just a towel wrapped around her hair. We sat down to eat and talked in the kitchen for a while until I heard the front door open and shut. With a wink, she slipped out the front door and took off her own towel. She walked in and closed her door, took off her blouse, and laid it on the chair. She wore a pair of shorts and a bikini top that exposed a lot of skin. She then turned around and went across the room. I could see that the shirt didn't come far enough down for me to see that she was wearing a thong. She was standing there with a couple of wine glasses on the counter in the kitchen when I grabbed her right shoulder and pushed her onto the sink. She grabbed me and we hugged tightly. Her back was against the mirror and I kissed her neck while running my hands up and down her back. Her head spun as my hand went lower along her spine, under the towel, then back up the side to her bare breasts. She let out a soft moan as I massaged her body.</p> <p>"I'm glad you came early. You looked really good in there," I said as I took off my shirt and shorts. "I like the way you look in a thong."</p> <p>Hehehe. I like that, she said as she looked me over in the mirror. She liked how muscular I looked, especially in my pants and the string bikini she had on underneath.</p> <p>"I really like how sexy you look in a thong, Alex," she said through clenched teeth. "And I like how hard you fuck..." she finished with a smile as she reached out for me.</p> <p>"Hah, I was just kidding," I nodded as I leaned down and kissed her once more. Our bodies pressed together as she stood and turned around. We embraced and kissed even tighter as I wrapped my arms around her and pulled her into me more. I started to move my hips against hers as she kissed me back with a passion that would otherwise never exist.</p> <p>When we finally broke for air, she stepped back from me, grabbed my hand and led me to the living room. We stood there, naked, facing each other in a deep gaze as our breaths started to quicken.</p> <p>"Well, I just finished my shower and figured that I could get dressed and meet you downstairs," she said as she grabbed my shirt and bra off the chair. "We can take the rest of the day off now and go out again. If you would like, you can pick up a hot pizza and wine."</p> <p>"That sounds fabulous," I said as it did. We quickly stripped as I grabbed her and carried her inside. We walked down the hallway to the kitchen and grabbed the beers and then walked out to the patio. It looked like she had prepared some lunch for our two of us.</p> <p>"Well, I hope we can do this again."</p> <p>"I just hope so! I really like being naked around you."</p> <p>"Come inside with me and lets grab something to eat."</p> <p>I headed to the kitchen where I grabbed a large pan and got an extra large glass full of iced up ice. The two of us ate our pizza while I got the remote.</p> <p>"Now we're making some really awesome porn," I said as I clicked on the remote. "Would you like to see some of it?"</p> <p>"That would be wonderful."</p> <p>"Why don't we just lay back on the sofa and watch some new videos?" I said as I took my drink and walked over to theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
