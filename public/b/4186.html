When I first thought of it later, it was almost like I was saying "I never knew there was such a gorgeous creature," but somehow I got more of a picture of the "beautiful creature" in my mind's eye all the time. At one point, my wife said to me over the course of several hours, "Is there another girl I could imagine having sex with?"</p> <p>It was all very erotic. I wanted my cock in her wet slit, she got a lot of pleasure out of the sex we had, and we made love until we were both completely spent, her in tears, me in the middle of an orgasm, the smell of a well-worked cunt wafting around her. That one night was the greatest sexual experience of my life. I was completely in love with my wife. But in the middle of our lovemaking...I was so consumed with sexual passion, I couldn't think straight.</p> <p>When my wife came home, she was in the mood for a little sex (well more like having sex, she was horny as fuck). Well, she took two condoms and put them on the kitchen table, and then she started taking them over and over. I could just imagine her being on her back on top of me, taking my cock inside her and being completely fucked. Just thinking about that made me hornier.</p> <p>But then, at about that time, and when I knew she had gotten ready to go to sleep, my mind was already elsewhere, with my wife giving me a blow job and then sleeping. So I got up and quietly made my way into the kitchen, and got the two condoms she was putting on and rolled them on over my cock, and then rolled back down so that I could have the pill as well, but also to prevent any leakage if I did it too quickly. I slipped the condom down my cock anyway, and when I did, I slipped an extra finger inside her, so she would know what I wanted to do - and it was great - so at that point I was at least partly asleep. For the next couple of hours, we just laid there with my arm around her, as we both took our well earned highs.</p> <p>We did not go to sleep, but we did let our desires become more clear and clear, and I found her hand playing with my nuts in the way that I often imagined her doing - the next time I slipped the condom down and her fingers began caressing them. I felt her hand going under my balls, and my dick got even harder.</p> <p>My mind was still in a state of semi-consciousness, but my body could not ignore the sensations in my scrotum as her fingers gently tickled my balls. I had been aching for her pussy for the last 5 or so years, and all of a sudden...the need to have someone do this for me was really starting to build in my nuts, so I grabbed her hand, and lifted her off of me, rolling into her arms I told her I would go get a bottle of wine. And I led her back into the bedroom, which was just a bunch of clothes I'd gotten for her on our trip...and got her out of a very tight t-shirt and her favorite skirt. She was wearing a short pink satin sleeveless blouse that just seemed to come down to her mid-thighs and hugged her round young ass-cheek. As I said, I loved her youngness, but what I didn't want now was to let her have sex, not really to be with any man. I didn't want to scare her off, and after I had her in a couple of our positions I got her to stand up first. As she stood naked in front of me wearing just her panties, she looked so hot. I was still aroused, and this was just the start, but we needed to do something about it.</p> <p>I was sitting on the bed in front of her, and I pulled up a t-shirt from a drawer, and unbuttoned her shirt, starting off with her tits and slowly working my way up, to her stomach. It was just about enough time to get her nipples hard, and I massaged them with my thumb and forefinger, squeezing them as the t-shirt moved up. After I got her shirt almost up to her mid-chest, I had a chance to take off her bra (which I'd bought on a trip to a little island the previous June), and as I did so, my cock jumped out of my shorts. My wife is only what she is - beautiful. At 5'10", and with 34-28-36 measurements, she could be considered hot at any number of levels, and this was one of her all-time fantasies - with someone her parents had bought me for my 25th birthdayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
