She said, 'Don't just rub it up and down, try and find it! Rub it all over! Oh, what you're doing feels so... it's so good! I'm going to come!'</p> <p>Doris took her hand away and rubbed it over his cock. Her other hand caressed his balls and the length of his cock.</p> <p>I felt a surge of wetness between my legs, and I felt like I had to breathe. It was really something to see.</p> <p>'You do like to do this, don't you, you lovely man!' I said.</p> <p>Doris pulled her hand away.</p> <p>'No, you're not, it's not so bad! It's just... it's just...' He hesitated.</p> <p>'So, you do make me come, and come, what? How is that better?'</p> <p>'It's really nice! I just...I just love it! Oh, that feels so... so nice! Just....'</p> <p>Doris pulled her hand away.</p> <p>'What? You have to finish it!' she said.</p> <p>'Well, you just go and get on the sofa and I'll do all the other stuff,' I said.</p> <p>Doris turned and ran for the sofa, but hesitated. I had got her alone before in a room of a dozen girls all together. I think I did. I also think that was why I hadn't tried to give her hand-job.</p> <p>Doris came in a few minutes. I had kept waiting for her to do it, but she never. She went to the sofa and sat down.</p> <p>'So, what's up?' I said.</p> <p>'Well, you go and get yourself off on the sofa for me, and I'll help you with the other stuff,' she said.</p> <p>'Oh, that! What are you going to do?' I asked, and suddenly realised...</p> <p>'It's been a while since something like that actually happened,' she said.</p> <p>'So, is it for you?' I said, 'Or not?'</p> <p>Doris got up and sat beside me on the sofa, and brought her knees together. It was obvious to me that neither of her legs were really in an easy position, as they clung together like a snake on its back. When she moved her legs, it dragged down. She looked up at me.</p> <p>'Do it, please, give me a hand job,' she said, 'Come and give me a hand-job.'</p> <p>I moved my hand down to her pussy. She was already wet. Her legs would have been tight, but when I moved my hand down the valley she was dripping wet. I touched her clit.</p> <p>It was big. And, like me, she was very excited. She put her legs together and started rubbing herself again.</p> <p>'Come in me,' she said, 'fuck me!'</p> <p>I moved my hand back up to her pussy. It was already wet, but my fingers were coated in her juice, and I started to slide them up and down her cleft.</p> <p>Her hips were rising and falling, and she was gasping and moaning.</p> <p>'Oh! Oh! Ooooh!' she cried, and her fingers went up to her mouth, and she was devouring them! Suddenly her entire body went on its own. She started to come, and as soon as she did, I could tell she was really excited.</p> <p>Her whole body shook, and she put her legs down, but her pussy was still pulsating all along on my fingers. I stopped.</p> <p>'Oh, that was so good!' she said, 'I'm so... so, soooo happy, so nice.'</p> <p>I kissed her, and she pushed herself against me. I could feel her breasts as she pushed herself against my chest. Then she kissed me again.</p> <p>'Now, can you come again?' she said.</p> <p>'I'm afraid I can't,' I said, 'I can't really...'</p> <p>'No, you can come with me,' she insisted. 'If you really want me to make you come, just hold each other. Just hold each other and we'll love each other. It will be soooo good!'</p> <p>Her hand went to my cock once more. It was now rock hard, and she started to move.</p> <p>I watched, fascinated and excited. I was feeling rather nervous. I could have gone with anybody. I could see her lips moving, and I heard her throat in. I could smell her lovely perfume. She was really excited, probably as much as I was.</p> <p>Then suddenly she stopped, and she sat back on the sofa.</p> <p>'Come with me,' she said, and with one hand she pulled me to her, with the otherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
