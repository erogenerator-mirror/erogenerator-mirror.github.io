He had no such desire for his wife, it was just what he was. He pushed her face harder into his balls, he ragged and pained breaths past his lips, she whimpered a quiet whimper and the first time he had given her oral sex she was his. He had been so eager to do this since their honeymoon and that first night. He had been eager to be inside her and she was his.</p> <p>"I want to hear you say it."</p> <p>She had tried so much to say it but a single word always slipped out or something. This time she had failed. She had used those words but her mouth didn't work. She didn't know her place here. He couldn't hear her anymore then he could see her but his need in her words was overriding his desire for her by force.</p> <p>"Oh" she cried out in a voice full with anguish. "That is sooo dirty my love," she said between gasps.</p> <p>"You are so beautiful," he said, stroking her hair.</p> <p>He was so proud of her but his passion for her was stronger than his need for a mother, his need for her and his desire for her. The only thing at fault was his own selfish desire to possess her and to make her his and only his. He couldn't stand the way they were going. He wanted to prove that she was his to do with whatever he wanted. It was as if she had her own destiny. In his opinion she wasn't his.</p> <p>"Get on your knees..." He had said with finality as if he would have been able to say more.</p> <p>He hadn't even touched her. He could see the anguish on her face. Her head was bowed again and she didn't lift her eyes from the floor. She hadn't said a word and he wanted there to be no more talking going on. Her words didn't mean anything but it didn't feel good to stop herself. She did speak. But how could he ever tell when there was a line in her brain? She was lost in her self image. She didn't realize it herself but she had come to be a submissive for him. She would be his to do with as he wanted.</p> <p>She turned back a bit after the first touch.</p> <p>She was so small he couldn't help stroking her cheek. He had never touched a woman without the aid of a mirror. She wasn't in his house. She wasn't there. That wasn't the place. He wanted her too to take her from the house to this and be alone with him. Instead of her leaving he would be alone with her. He wanted her to be his.</p> <p>"Please stop... I... can't... I am your mistress."</p> <p>He had stopped at that point and she hadn't answered. She was lying. His sub was too fragile to ask for anything more.</p> <p>But it only made it worse. The power that she had held over him was not what he was used to from her, that he would never give her. He wanted to see her in control, with control. There were too many rules and he didn't want to be a part of that. His mistress was his mistress. Wasn't he under his mistress' power too?</p> <p>"I don't want to talk now." He stepped back and held out his hand.</p> <p>They had been going at it for five minutes. She didn't even bother to lift her eyes at him. Instead she just laid her body on her back with her head at his foot. He reached over to the night stand and pulled out a tube of lube. He had to tell her once. He didn't want to do this. He would talk later. He would tell her how her lips had sucked and how he had pulled her back into his body and had forced her to kiss him, his body to lie over hers until he filled her. She had to think. He pulled out a condom from his pocket and took care not to use it. The only thing he could think anymore was that he would probably never fuck his sexy wife again.</p> <p>He leaned down and quickly pushed the rubber into her body.</p> <p>He held his breath.</p> <p>He had felt like such a fool but he had wanted this too. He tried to get his thoughts in order. It was his wife's words he had heard but his heart hadn't told him anything. It was the sound of passion when the words came out. It was his voice. He was telling her all his things and then he thought again the way to a better conclusion than that.</p> <p>She didn't say anything but his face said it all. He was in charge of what she wanted. He didn't need to listen to her voice anymore. She wanted what was coming, she needed him to be her master.</p> <p>He kneltâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
