In that moment, the whole world disappeared under the light of our love. Her breathing was the most natural thing in the world, but I know it was because she was overwhelmed, overcome with emotion.</p> <p>She gave a small kiss to my lips and told me she loved.</p> <p>I kissed hers back, more passionately as our emotions climbed. Her arms went around my neck, and in answer I held her tight to me, allowing her full weight to press me down against the mattress. Her hand had found and cupped my left breast, and I could feel it through my thin silk nightshirt and thin bra. We lay there.</p> <p>"That was incredible," I heard her breathe.</p> <p>"You've got the right idea."</p> <p>I rolled onto my side, and we lay there for a while. When I was comfortable, I pulled her back. Without losing contact with her, I kissed her lips. As we kissed, she opened her eyes to look at me. I felt my face blush, and then to my surprise, my mouth opened. My tongue slid across hers, her body responding instantly. My hand slid down between us, finding her pussy through the thin material of her nightshirt, and I rubbed it against the top of her thigh. She pressed her pelvis towards me, and I rubbed my finger against her clit. She gasped at the feeling, and pulled me tighter to her. My hand was pressed between her legs at the same time, feeling the heat emanating from her crotch. It was so different from the feel of her husband's hand. More flesh, more muscle. I could hardly feel the fabric.</p> <p>Her lips pressed harder against mine, her body sliding against mine, and I felt the tension in her body relax. As the tension became relaxed, her lips moved from my mouth, and her breath whispered from her in my ear. With an effort, I moved, repositioned the upper half of my body, and pressed my upper leg between hers. Again, it wasn't enough. My other leg was pressed between hers, but the position had limited me in a way I might have liked. I lifted my upper half, and then slid my hips, slowly, up and down, sliding my upper leg closer to hers. When I hit her lips again with my tongue, she opened to me, and our mouths found each other again.</p> <p>I ran my tongue over hers for a while, then raised my leg, and pressed it down, rubbing it with her. The tension and tension and the pleasure I felt with her was stronger than the tension and the frustration with my husband that the situation was causing. I slid down her body, sliding my panties down to the base of her body. I slid down her torso, moving the light material of her nightshirt out of the way, and then moved lower, my breasts sliding over her thighs and down, and her legs opening as I neared her crotch. I felt her lips quivering and heard herself moan as the tip of my tongue grazed the tip of her clitoris. By now it was in control, and my tongue went down, licking at her cleft in circular and circular strokes. I moved it back up, sucking her lips in, licking on the roof of her channel. I wanted to taste the juice leaking from her, to have my tongue slide across it, to feel her cum against me.</p> <p>I moved my tongue to her clit, and she lifted her hips at my tongue's caress. I could feel her excitement and her wetness, and I began to work my way back to her clit, rubbing my wet tongue across it until it was hard and sensitive.</p> <p>"Oh, God. That is so good," she whimpered. "Don't stop. Put more in."</p> <p>Her hips pushed back at me, and I slid my middle finger inside her. I knew my mouth and lips felt wonderful, but I wanted more. I rolled my finger against her opening and began to circle again, slowly. She kept saying thank you, and I couldn't speak just then.</p> <p>"I love you."</p> <p>"I love you, too."</p> <p>After a while her hips settled a bit so I stopped again. She was clearly in control.</p> <p>I raised up, feeling the frustration from her frustration, and brought her lower body down to the side of my hips. Her legs were over my ankles and her body pressed my hips against her. I held her as she lay back up with her shoulders on the bed, with her head towards the ceiling. I kissed her again, hard, and I wanted to show her how sexy she was, how desirable she was as a woman. When she opened her eyes, she kissed me. She pressed her tongue deep into my mouth. I felt my entire body shiver with excitement.</p> <p>She was very good.
