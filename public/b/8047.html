You slide your hand up my side and around my hip, your fingers sliding over my nipple causing me to moan in my throat.</p> <p>Your eyes are so soft and I cannot take it any longer. I want to feel you inside of me so badly. I can feel our juices running out of me onto my thighs. I can feel you trembling against my hip and hear your heavy breathing. Our hearts are beating so very hard. Your lips curl into a devious smile as you lean in for another kiss. Your kiss so sweet. I lean back and put my hands up to brace myself against the wall to steady myself. You kiss me all over again and as you pull your fingers from my body, your body moves up against mine. Your mouth moves in closer and you kiss me again, your tongue dancing across my lips and against mine.</p> <p>We continue this for several minutes until I feel my legs start to shake uncontrollably. I can hear you whispering to me to get out of the bath, and I reluctantly pull my hands away from the wall to let your arms wrap around both of my legs. You slide them up my body, slowly but firmly, pulling my body tight to yours as you slide your palms over my breasts. I arch into your hands as you begin to rub my nipple between your fingers and feel your body pressing against mine. Your finger trails across the top of my clit as you rub me slowly at first, and then faster, until I'm begging you to fuck me with your penis. You slide your finger out of me and press it to my lips. My tongue circles my lips, tasting yourself as you slide your finger into my mouth and lick my juices off of your finger. I moan on your finger in response to your kiss, and you moan back at me.</p> <p>I have never been this hot before, and when you begin to slide your finger in and out of my mouth, it only helps to build my desire up even further. You slide your hand down to my pussy and begin rubbing my clit as you do. My back arching into you hard and I can feel your finger slide deep inside of me as I arch into you and your thumb circles my clit.</p> <p>At this point, I must stop you because I want you to come inside of me. You take back what I thought was going to happen. I reach into the tub to pull the drain back, and you quickly pull me into the tub. I climb up onto the bench and you wrap one arm around my stomach to keep me in place as your other hand finds my swollen clit. I feel a shock as you finally begin to rub me there. I moan against your shoulder through your kiss and your finger quickly slides into me and you begin to massage my g-spot.</p> <p>I moan loudly at the intense pleasure shooting through my body. This isn't going to be the last time we make love and I'm ready to spend the rest of my life with you. I can barely control my moans so you just have to have more sense. Your hand slowly moves from my clit up to my breast, your breath catching in your mouth and you begin to flick my nipple with your palm. A gasp escapes my lips and you slide a finger out of me so you can rub it around my clit. You slide it over and over again, and then return it to my body. As you start rubbing my clit harder, I arch into your hand and you press yourself harder against me. Your grip on my nipple tightens and I have to push myself out of you as deeply as I can as another finger pushes into me. Your hand tightens on my nipple as my body begins to shake and shake.</p> <p>The climax is very intense as I feel you throb as deep inside of me your body quivers as you thrust in and out of me. My body begins to flutter as I lose control again and I feel your hand slip out of my body. You hold your position against my pussy, watching as I look down to see you rubbing my clit and my breasts. I can feel your cock pressing against my thigh and my eyes roll up in my head.</p> <p>You stand up over me and we both turn slightly, so we were facing each other. You lean down, putting your hand on my stomach and then I lean back against you as we kiss. Our tongues dancing with each other and a bit of our saliva mingling together. Slowly you move back down my body and again take my mouth. We kiss so passionately that my kisses are no longer mine until you slowly push me back up to the edge of the tub. You remove my hands from behind my head with your free hand and slide your cock into my body once again and start slow. Your hips move faster into me and I begin to moan uncontrollably andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
