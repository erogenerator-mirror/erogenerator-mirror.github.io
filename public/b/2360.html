It was the first time you've seen me without my bra on! Well, that's all part of the job then!"</p> <p>"Now that I see you, I think I've made good progress on the job, don't you?" As she leaned close to me, her breasts were right in my face and I looked up at her. The way I looked, I could almost smell the scent of her body lotion.</p> <p>"We're going to start with a little of the massage. Here's my number. I'm almost fifty-seven years old."</p> <p>I took her hand and led her towards the bedroom. "Okay then. I'll be back in a little bit."</p> <p>"You've got the massage all planned," she said as we went down the hall.</p> <p>"What? I can't, it's a client. I have work in the afternoon. I thought we'd finish off with some wine and relax a little while. You know the rest of our schedule, right?"</p> <p>"Of course, it's just a short ride."</p> <p>I started up and made sure the door was locked as I headed for the bedroom.</p> <p>In the bedroom, I had just opened the door a crack and was about to look in.</p> <p>"Hey, we've opened a new chapter in our lives! How'd you do?" She said walking towards me.</p> <p>"I've always been in charge, I'm usually in control!"</p> <p>She was right. But she made me feel like I was powerless, her eyes had that mischievous look as if she wanted to say 'what the fuck do you want?'</p> <p>Her breasts were a perfect handful and her legs were in a short length of black hair. She had to be five nine or so and I'd have assumed she was at the top of her school's curve.</p> <p>"You have a lovely face," she said as her hands were moving up and down my sides.</p> <p>I smiled and let her take me into her arms and we kissed. As we held each other I felt her hand go down my back, her hand squeezing my firm buttocks.</p> <p>I pulled away to say it was 'the best massage I've ever had.'</p> <p>"That's what most folks call it now."</p> <p>Her breath was hot against my cheek as she ran her fingers all over my back. She didn't even try to touch my cock.</p> <p>"But you can do it a different way," I said as her fingers slid down my spine.</p> <p>My cock was straining hard under her hand and it throbbed against her fingers.</p> <p>"No," I said a little more forcefully. "It's more exciting," I corrected, looking her straight in the eye.</p> <p>"But I want you, I want to be part of your life. What would you like me to do?"</p> <p>"Well, it's up to you," I said. "What would you like?"</p> <p>"Do you want me to take my clothes off and do you?" She asked. "Do you want to play with my body?"</p> <p>"Yeah," I said.</p> <p>"How about this," she said as she unbuttoned her blouse. "You put my blouse aside," she said as she unhooked the front closure, "and slide my bra aside." She held her bra together with one hand.</p> <p>"You can leave it there for a while," I said. "And go ahead and reach your hands up my skirt."</p> <p>I pulled her skirt and her panties off quickly. She moved onto the bed as I kissed her. I lifted her legs onto the bed and she helped me pull her up until she was laying over my chest.</p> <p>"Now you're on my other side," I said as I looked at her beautiful body.</p> <p>"That's all the way," she said as she spread my thighs allowing her body to rub up against mine.</p> <p>"You'll be comfortable, no need for your hands for now," I whispered to her.</p> <p>"I like to hold you," she said as both hands came to rest on my bare legs. "You feel good." She started sliding her hands up and down my legs, slowly. I started slowly and she was kissing me all over, not touching my head for instance. As her strokes got longer and I started to breathe more easily, she would start moving her hands around, rubbing my thighs.</p> <p>We kept kissing slowly as she moved them up my body. Soon she'd have to use her hands to hold me up as she went higher.</p> <p>"Oh, you feel so good!" she said as she kept moving her hands, moving them around my belly for a moment on each journeyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
