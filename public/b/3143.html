It was followed by the rustle of clothes, and soon it was time to turn. That noise came at a sudden noise in the silence of our room.</p> <p>"Good." Was all I could say in response to the sudden silence of the room. "Let's see what happens now." I heard a soft rustle, which was followed by a soft groan, and seconds later I felt the bed move around with the sound of someone moaning. My eyes opened momentarily to stare at the sight of a naked woman writhing in total confusion as her body betrayed her desire for being sexually pleasured.</p> <p>I had no idea what was so wrong with me anymore, and quickly turned back to find my senses searching for what I thought to be a familiar sound. "Where did that come from?"</p> <p>It sounded like the woman had moved to be closer to me. Her naked form was on the bed, her hips still moving up and down to help the thrust of the man beneath her.</p> <p>"You know it's me, aren't you?" I felt her body rise from the bed to her four hands, and then my eyes fell on the woman. Her hips had shifted slightly from the thrust of the man below her and I saw that she had slid down the leg over the man's face. Her head was buried in a pillow and her eyes looked right at us as she reached her hand for something from the next room. She held something around her neck and looked at me and I smiled.</p> <p>"Did you get to cum on the man?" she said in between moaning.</p> <p>"He did." Was my reply. "I just wanted to get that over with."</p> <p>She moved a moment later, still standing in the corner. I took that opportunity to look over the woman's body as she stood. She had long brown hair and her eyes, which always seem to be staring straight at me, were wide open. "Who's it?" she asked as she walked towards me.</p> <p>I shook my head, and said "It's none of your business."</p> <p>"It's ours," she smiled.</p> <p>"Is yours alone?" I asked.</p> <p>She nodded.</p> <p>"Your turn." I reached out with my hand and gave her thigh a friendly squeeze. "Go sit, and I'll be right there."</p> <p>She smiled back at me and then walked over to the bedroom door. "Don't stay off his face, okay?"</p> <p>"What? " I asked, but before I could speak, she stepped out of the bedroom. She tossed the items she was holding down, and then walked slowly to me. As she approached me, a large bulge stood out in my pants as I watched her walk.</p> <p>I felt my hard cock rising from my pants as she approached and stood with one foot, one knee, and the other foot. Her left leg fell slowly to the side and I could see the moisture gathering at the junction of her legs. She looked down at the bulge in my pants, and her eyes widened.</p> <p>Her eyes opened in question once more. "Don't cover it," she commanded. I felt her lift one of her hands and rub up and down my left leg, feeling the warmness of the fabric against my hardness.</p> <p>She moved a second hand and I felt her soft fingers glide up and down my leg, stopping to squeeze the soft flesh of my thigh. "Does that feel good?" she asked, but it was only a question.</p> <p>"Yes," I assured her. "It feels good." As she pressed her hand further up my leg I felt the fingers hook on the outside of my panties. Not sure how, I closed my eyes and gave in to the pleasure. "Yes. "</p> <p>She pressed harder, squeezing me. "You like that?" she said as she squeezed me harder.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Does it feel good for you?" she commanded again.</p> <p>"Yes. I'm just so turned on. "</p> <p>"I can feel how turned on you are. " She pressed even harder, which helped my pants slide up a little. My hands went up to find the top of her ass. The material had slid down and I could just make out her black panties. They were almost transparent, and I suspected the wetness that had leaked out. "Your panties are wet." She asked as I looked over to see her finger slipping between the lips of her pussy. "Is it wet?"</p> <p>"Yes, but I don't see any wetness."</p> <p>"No, that's where my finger is." Her finger reached up and pressed against the material of her panties, then rubbed upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
