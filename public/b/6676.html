Their kissing grew closer and closer to the point of explosion. His fingers moved along her back again and down to the top of her ass. The tips of his fingers were gently touching her ass. It felt so soft and sweet inside. His thumb moved downward again as he continued to kiss her face. In the excitement and anticipation of his tongue on her lips he lightly bit her lips a little, sending tingles throughout her body and making her body tingle.</p> <p>She groaned softly into his mouth and pushed her body against his. His body pressed against hers, making his cock press against her ass. She wanted his hard meat inside her; her body could not deny. The fire between them went wild. She pressed against him, grinding her ass against him and trying to drive her body along his hard cock, so hot that it was as if it was moving back and forth in her crotch and rubbing up and down on his pelvis as they rocked together. She felt her pussy moisten.</p> <p>She felt his hands move up and down her back. He moved them from her shoulders to her waist and she lifted her ass up slightly. He ran his hands up and then back down under her shirt. He played her body like a symphony.</p> <p>In the excitement and passion she felt her breathing quicken. She felt her breasts bounce slightly and the sound of wet bodies made it louder and sexier, as it became her whole body. His hands moved around to cup her breasts, pulling and squeezing them, while he kissed her neck and ears. She could feel her pussy tingle. She could not believe that it was happening. Never before in her life had there been a man such a romantic, so passionate. His hands moved back and forth from her neck to her breasts, circling them, touching the pink buttons that were erect through her shirt, while he lightly sucked on each nipple. Her pussy became wetter and warmer. She knew he could feel her wetness as he kissed it and suck on her tits. His touch was electric.</p> <p>She started to feel light-headed and wild with her mind, as her body was experiencing waves and waves of orgasm. She knew her pussy was now dripping down her thighs and her arms were trembling. She threw herself onto him. The sexual passion was unbelievable, so intense. It was like a volcano inside, burning her, boiling through her into a white, hot fire. She was not sure her heart could breathe and she knew her breathing would come out in a pant. She grabbed his shoulders and pulled him toward her, wanting to feel his hard cock against her pussy again. She kissed him in passion. His mouth covered hers and her tongue found his. Their tongues explored each other’s mouth until it broke free. The passion was strong and strong. It moved him towards her and left his erection waving in the air.</p> <p>She started to undo his pants, still kissing him. She felt that they were completely naked inside the room. They broke their embrace and looked at each other.</p> <p>“Are you sure you want me to go this far?” the man, Tom, the bartender said.</p> <p>“I want you to undress me.”</p> <p>“Are you sure you want me to take care of you?” He asked, and then, after looking at her face, he added, “No, let me undress you first.”</p> <p>“Tom, I am feeling more than excited. I need to be naked for you and I want to feel you.”</p> <p>“Please, let me undress you,” Tom said as he pulled off her skirt. It was as he removed it that she felt a strong erotic feeling. Her skin felt as though it was burning with the heat from the moment it had been touching her flesh. She could feel her own body heating up, feeling almost like an explosion of desire for herself. She was about to feel him nude himself. She wanted to feel him on her, feel his hard body pressed against her soft body. “Do you have something to unwrap?” she asked his.</p> <p>“Yes,” Tom replied a bit shy and looking shyly away from her again, then said, “You will like it,” as he reached up and started to unbutton her blouse.</p> <p>“Wait a minute, let me look at you,” she said as she removed the blouse. Her breasts were so beautiful and warm. They were so inviting. The light pink nipples were erect, and swollen. The skin around her areolae was smooth. Her aureoles were smaller than average, but the surrounding nipples were darker pink, like chocolate. Her aureoles were smaller, but her nipples were much heavier than they were yesterday, and her dark areoles were so tender.
