There was a large part of her that didn't believe a word that she said, but the rest of her took a sip herself. The only thing that could possibly make up for it all was the way he tasted. She wondered if she were going to drink all that wine or just sit there and let herself feel it.</p> <p>Her head hung for a while and her eyes began to grow heavy. She tried to remember the wine in her glass but there was nothing but empty space in her head. She took the second glass, sat it down on the night stand, and sipped the hot, dry white wine.</p> <p>Dana's head began to spin as the alcohol began to loosen up her body. There was a sudden rush that she felt as she began to open her mind up to the unknown. The unknown was the wine that she had consumed earlier. She felt light-headed as the warmth slowly began to seep around her neck. Her body began to feel a tingle as she closed her eyes and just let the warmth flow through her body.</p> <p>Her mind was at a dead end as her stomach turned. At that time she was sure that she could hear the rumble of a bus horn outside, but she was no longer so sure. She knew that she had to return the wine to the night stand, but a voice in her head told her that if she didn't, she wouldn't drink it all. Her knees gave way as she began to slide down the hall, trying to stand.</p> <p>As she stood, she looked over her shoulder to see if a different body had come across the room, and found the same dark curly hair. The light of a lantern that hung overhead was the only thing making out in the darkness.</p> <p>The only thing that she could see anymore was the face of the man on the bed. She could feel her body growing heavier as he took her hand and lead her to the bathroom. The warmth of the tub was hot and soft. She could hear the water running as the man sat down and began to undress. Dana watched as his thick and muscular body came into view as his shirt came off.</p> <p>She tried to stand up as he stood up and wrapped a towel around her, but the warmth of the water still enveloped her at the waist. He held the towel firmly in place around her waist and as his hands began to unbutton her pants his hands began to roam under her pants in a most unzealous way. She was now feeling like the object of his manhood when her hips began to move slowly as he lowered the pants on her feet. It was so strange just standing there as her pants fell to her feet.</p> <p>Her legs began to buckle as he helped her to her feet. She began to rub the towel against his skin as she tried to get it from him. She couldn't get her hands around the waist of the shirt as its' fabric pressed against her skin. He smiled at her and he could see that she felt better.</p> <p>Dana could feel that his dick began to grow within the confines of his pants as she slowly began to strip them from her body. She looked at her body and her mind began to come back to the darkness of the man's body, but when her sight returned to the man who had just lowered his pants to the ground.</p> <p>She could hear the sounds of the shower washing as she struggled with the shirt and then he began to help her out of the top. He pulled a cloth from a plastic washing bowl and rubbed the wash away, all the while looking into her eyes as they looked into his. She felt her breathing begin to quicken as her eyes looked into his again.</p> <p>As her eyes began to return to his face she felt herself get more anxious. She could feel herself beginning to lose control. The tingling started to spread out outward from her toes to her head. The first wave of pleasure began to take her through the rest of her body.</p> <p>The next wave came from her toes and it felt like she was having a hard time breathing. She was shaking from head to toe. The tingling built up to a boiling point and the wave broke, sending her into a fit that left her feeling dizzy to say the least. The feelings were intense, but she managed to gasp as the first wave of pleasure continued to rip through her.</p> <p>Dana shook, but her eyes stayed locked on the man's face. She watched as his hands slid gently around her body, his fingertips playing with the water across her skin. She felt his lips kiss her fingers and a soft smile came to her face as he began to soap her body up. Her skin was soon covered in goose bumps. Her body took on a sexual glow like a foggy blanket, but the water was still hot. Dana gasped as she thought she couldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
