He asked, holding her hands in his. Looking into her sparkling, sparkling, and tear-streaked eyes, he kissed her forehead, nose, chin and eyes.</p> <p>"Oh, David, I'd be so happy if it was you I was going to cry out for. If it was me that was going to cry out for me to fall over. I think it's all just so beautiful. It seems so beautiful that I can't describe it."</p> <p>"There's more to a girl than just sitting there beside you," he said, gently sliding one hand into her hair. "There's more to love. I can't think of anything more perfect to do with my heart than to hold your hands."</p> <p>She reached up to hold his face, and he leaned back, looking into her eyes. "I love you, Jenny," he said, as he brushed the hair from her eyes and kissed her on the lips.</p> <p>"I love you, too, David," she said, as he pulled her in for another kiss.</p> <p>"I know you do," he smiled as he turned their faces toward the sound of her voice, "I wish I could hold you, but I can't. I can't."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, David," she said. "I'm not really sure if that's what you want. Just think about it, okay?"</p> <p>"Okay," he said, nodding.</p> <p>He leaned in, and lightly brushed his lips on hers, and she kissed him back like she did after their first date. They stood there in the kitchen, with just the two of them left in the world.</p> <p>The next morning, David and Jenny awoke to the sound of the kitchen door closing. They looked at each other with bewildered looks.</p> <p>"Good morning, honey."</p> <p>"Morning, David," she smiled. "Let's get up."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>There's more left to tell, but I hope I'll have as much as I can share on this journey. Please, let's see if we can make it to the next chapter of this amazing tale. Please, vote and let me know what you think of the story so far.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The following Saturday, David and Jenny drove their lovely, naked bodies home with the intention of spending the whole night up in their new room. The bed that they shared was a perfect, bedroom-sized place to sleep, they loved it, and they couldn't wait to use it.</p> <p>When they found their way into the house, David walked to the front door leading to the garage, where they'd parked their old car last night. He went around to the driver's side, where they'd gathered the bags he'd brought. They got into the house, where they'd be able to look both ways at the entrance with impunity and as they did all the things that happened that morning.</p> <p>As they walked down the drive, David kissed Jenny on the forehead, "I want to say something to you," he said.</p> <p>"I'll be happy to hear," she smiled.</p> <p>Jenny went first, opening the sliding door to the sliding and sliding door opening the other way for the stairs, "I'm glad that we're here."</p> <p>"Me too. I really like it here very much."</p> <p>They both got out of the car, and Jenny looked at David. "It's been my most exciting weekend, and the second most exciting weekend I've had the rest of my life."</p> <p>"I'm not sure I can stay here tonight," he said with a smile.</p> <p>"I know you're tired of me, David," she started.</p> <p>"So am I. You should be glad you're here. I'm only staying for tonight. I promise."</p> <p>"David, just the way you are here, and what you've done for me, I'm not all that upset that you are here."</p> <p>She took his hand, "It's okay. I'm here for a change." She pulled him closer.</p> <p>"I am here. All of this is my fault," he said.</p> <p>"It's my fault too, darling," she replied. "It's all my fault. I can't live with what I think I've done for you and for myself."</p> <p>Jenny kissed away his tears, "I love you, David. I'm not mad about what we've done." She put her arms around him, and he put his arms around her, "It's okay, honey. I know how that feels."</p> <p>"I know that you're upset because you're disappointed that my first time didn't go thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
