I'll be back later." He walked in with a bottle of champagne, giving it a shake and smiling. I turned around to see the two guys in his uniform looking at us.</p> <p>I saw the two of them start laughing when we told them we were leaving. I turned around to see they had both changed and they were smiling at us. I looked over to the other guy who was watching the both girls talking. I couldn't help but watch them as they walked back to the table. I'm sure they could tell what was between us and they both laughed loudly so I knew I had something to worry about. He turned to smile at me and then I saw the one he was with turn back to look at what we were talking about.</p> <p>We sat back down and made small talk for a few minutes. The one that had been sitting next to us was the one I was talking to when I had stopped him coming into our office.</p> <p>"What are you trying to do to me?" I asked him.</p> <p>"Oh she's just waiting for you to ask her to play," he laughed.</p> <p>"I don't know. I think I could keep her happy with my company's money. We don't have anything to worry about." I was starting to wonder if we should call it a day and go home. As I was being teased I could tell he was wondering what his father would think.</p> <p>"I don't know about you guys. I like it, but I am not sure I know what it is."</p> <p>"We need to buy a car," the other one said. "I would like to stay and play when you get back to your office."</p> <p>"We'll buy it," I said. "But what's the difference between playing a little and keeping your parents happy?" I could tell that the two of them weren't happy so I decided to use my free hand to touch their bodies.</p> <p>"It's different to keep your parents happy. I'm sure they've had time to relax since you've been gone. But I can still keep them happy," he said to her.</p> <p>"You wouldn't let us stop you, would you?"</p> <p>"If the time is right, I don't want to change my plans," he said with a shrug.</p> <p>I smiled at him and his smile told me everything I needed to know. Just the same I got a little nervous as I looked over to the man staring at me as I played with her.</p> <p>I reached over and grabbed her hand feeling her pull away to look at him. I moved her hand back to my lap but she just moved back to me.</p> <p>"I'd like to play with you," I said. "If that's what it took to keep you happy."</p> <p>"Oh really? I can play with you? When?" He asked her.</p> <p>"How about right now?" I grinned, turning around to look at him while stroking my cock while my fingers massaged her clit. She gasped at that.</p> <p>"I'm ready now," she said when I released her hand from mine.</p> <p>"Oh baby, what's wrong?"</p> <p>"Nothing. I've got just the thing for you. Just follow me," she said as he walked with her to his office.</p> <p>"Let me go first," he said to me.</p> <p>"You've got to be kidding. This one is so special." I laughed.</p> <p>"Is that because of the way we are friends?" He laughed.</p> <p>"No! No way," I told him. We walked from the bar to the elevator and he pushed it up to his office. When the doors closed behind us he reached up to grab my hand. I followed and as the elevator door opened he looked at me and then quickly turned his attention back to her.</p> <p>It was the same look I had had the last time we had come in. He looked at me as he reached down for the tie at her neck letting it fall off her shoulder, leaving her gorgeous little hand resting on my shoulder. She leaned her head back looking up at me smiling.</p> <p>"So," he started. "How much do you think your father would pay to keep our company's money?"</p> <p>"He wants to know about the future of our company and what the future holds," she said smiling at him.</p> <p>I could feel my cock straining against my shorts and hoped for something else.</p> <p>"So I'm going to call in sick tomorrow morning to be picked up at the airport. How does that sound?" He asked her.</p> <p>"I'm going to fly to Los Angeles tomorrow morning," she said looking at me as I wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
