She was not sure what to do. Should she? Decide for her to go with the flow? She couldn't leave it there anymore. The moment that it passed, everything was right in her heart.</p> <p>Her legs grew shaky. She felt like she was going to topple over if this man did not stop now and do as he was told. Or else she would fall on her face in a state that she had never been in before.</p> <p>The man spoke from behind her. "Are you ready for some of this?"</p> <p>"Yes, please."</p> <p>He lifted her onto his lap, her body pressing against his as he rubbed her clit around his dick. He placed her on his cock, feeling the hot steel of steel penetrate every inch of her. Her eyes widened with surprise, her body quivered, her mouth opened to say something, but instead came a scream. Then she moaned the word "please."</p> <p>He thrust himself harder, driving her into the air once again. Again she started to feel her body beginning to convulse.</p> <p>Then it was over.

He took the man's shirt as he raised back up, his head in her direction. He was licking and sucking her nipples like a madman. She arched her back and pushed her boobs into his face.</p> <p>Her head thrashed back and forth as she felt the cock slide deeper inside her. The feeling was intense. She grabbed his head and held his face tight as she felt the cock thrust in and out of her pussy. When she climaxed this time, he came with her. His cum splashing around the insides of her pussy, his body shaking.</p> <p>She lay panting and spent as she felt his cum leaking down both of her legs. His fingers pressed the top button of his sweat pants and released the contents of his balls. He stepped away allowing them to be caught in the waist band of his pants and pulled up his underwear.</p> <p>"I have no condom." He said, pointing at the man next to him. He watched for a moment as the man, already naked stood. He walked over to the man and held the door open as they walked towards the restroom.</p> <p>"Well."
