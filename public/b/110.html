She didn't want the conversation to become a sexual encounter. It could be one of two things. She could say she'd done this before, that she was the one who'd been doing it with another woman, or she could talk about it with her husband. It was pretty inevitable that she'd get the opportunity, to share with one of her friends the intimacy of sharing her sexual excitement with another woman. As if it could be any other explanation for everything she was being asked, she didn't do that.</p> <p>She really had no idea that it would be this easy for her to be with another man or woman. She never gave it a thought, even when it was a turn-on, and she'd certainly never do anything with another guy and/or woman. She knew better now. She didn't trust herself to do it at all.</p> <p>She was beginning to realize that, for all her years of sexual exploration with men, her secret fantasy was always to be with another woman. Sure, she'd had some fun with other women, when it was just a fantasy, but never have she actually experienced it. She wasn't sure that she knew herself that well enough to actually get involved in a sex game with another woman, and then get turned-on enough to enjoy doing it. It might have been exciting, or she never would have had the courage to do that for herself. She'd never admit to being a voyeur for fear of losing her marriage over something that would bring down her reputation on the Internet, while trying to maintain her identity as a lesbian. She certainly didn't get into a role role right now.</p> <p>She sat there as a puddle, unable to look at the floor at all. Finally she got out of the bath, dried off, washed her hair, and left to bed in silence. She felt so horny. The image of Tom and Sherrie fucking in the tub brought her arousal to a fevered pitch. She felt so bad for Tom and Sherrie, that Tom had to get out as soon as he could, and soon.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p>He pulled into the driveway of his home at 7:00am and saw Sherrie sitting on the porch swing in her favorite dress as she'd told him to do. He quickly ran from the house, got in his Camaro and pulled away.</p> <p>He was so busy driving he was surprised to see the front door open. He rushed in the front door, and ran in his living room, where Sherrie was still sitting on the edge of the sofa in front of his home fireplace, and was standing beside his TV.</p> <p>She was looking at a DVD in the VCR. "You're really late."</p> <p>"I've been out here before, with Sherrie."</p> <p>"That movie of yours, it's been a while."</p> <p>He nodded, "You're doing okay. I've missed you."</p> <p>"It's been a while, too." Sherrie turned to look at him, and his face went white. "You're all wet."</p> <p>"Sorry to interrupt your TV. Are you coming or going?"</p> <p>She grinned at him, "I'm just enjoying the evening."</p> <p>"So long as you won't turn me down."</p> <p>"The evening's not over," she said. "It'll soon be. Besides, it's time you and me got to know each other better."</p> <p>"Are you sure. It's been a while, has it?"</p> <p>"It's been long enough."</p> <p>"I'm not finished yet," he said, taking her hand and kissing it. Sherrie was shocked at his abruptness and the fact that he wanted to kiss her. Before she knew it, he was pulling her to her feet.</p> <p>She stumbled a few steps back, "What are you doing?"</p> <p>"Not so serious. We're a married couple for God's sake, don't get me wrong. You can still be my wife, if you want to, but I'll just go have fun with some girl."</p> <p>She stared at him, not saying a word.</p> <p>He leaned over and ran his lips up her jaw line to her ear. She heard him breathing, and then he was kissing her on the neck. She was stunned and could barely breath. A wave of nervousness rushed over her body. She'd been so close to having sex with Tom and Sherrie, but never had she really done it. She knew what he wanted to do now, but she didn't know him.</p> <p>His lips slid over hers, and as soon as their lips touched, they froze in a deep kiss. Their fingers fumbled and rubbed each other's wet bodies.
