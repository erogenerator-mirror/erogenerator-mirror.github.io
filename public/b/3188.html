She said to herself. It was Sunday and the night was cold. The sun was still shining in the windows.</p> <p>She was lying on her back at the bottom of her bed. She was breathing heavily from exertion. It had been a long time. She started to put her clothes on and noticed a small bottle of aspirin, which smelled like something orange. It was very bitter and smelled like she had used it yesterday to pee. She picked up the aspirin and tried it in her mouth. She liked it better the way it tasted. In her current state of mind she could smell the smell of orange fruit. Suddenly her mouth closed down around a turd.</p> <p>"Oh God," she said.</p> <p>Her throat constricted as the cold, watery mixture washed over her.</p> <p>After she was sure that there was no risk in drinking it she got up and went with her to the bathroom. She looked at her long brown hair and wondered if it was as red as it was yesterday. As she looked at her brown hair and thought about how beautiful it looked her body began to respond. She had never had sex without being completely satisfied and when she felt the wetness she got when she was on her back she got horny again.</p> <p>Her hips were pumping her pussy up and down like a piston and her hands were shaking so much that she found her nipples. Her nipples were stiff and hard and they were hurting slightly. So instead she had a nice feeling of pressure between them.</p> <p>She looked at the shower and saw no sign of a mirror and she wished she could see herself as she was in the shower. This was a wonderful morning after having sex with her ex. She started laughing at herself for being so naive in her own mind.</p> <p>The water from the shower felt good on her skin and she loved the feeling of having this hot water all over her body. She felt her body tremble and shook a bit after being in the shower. She reached back and pushed her cheeks together with her hands. She started to rub her asshole with one hand, enjoying with the feeling of being naked in the shower all exposed to the day light.</p> <p>She got herself under the shower and washed her hair and then ran her hands down her belly and then through her pubic hair. She washed each part of this body. She washed her pubic hair in front to get a big amount of soap in her hands and she started working her hands down to the base of her clit as she always did.</p> <p>It was the most sensitive part of her body. She found with her finger that her clit was the center of all the pleasure centres of her being. Her body seemed to be responding to this sensation. She massaged her clit while washing herself back there. Then she turned the water off and let the hot water spray it as well so that she could enjoy it completely.</p> <p>When she turned around and looked out of the bathroom mirror she saw herself. She had always had a sexy body. She saw her blonde hair and her big boobs with her hard round nipples. She had never thought she could go for it but now that she had been in the shower she was going to find out.</p> <p>It was obvious that some of the feelings from the day were having the desired effect on her. She enjoyed the sensation of it and was glad she had taken the time to shave since she knew if she let any sun cream cover it would make her nipples pop.</p> <p>She started to get into position to take her pussy. First she pulled her lips apart, then let the water caress her pussy and then slid the middle finger of her right hand up and down on her opening. The feeling was so soft and smooth and she loved it. Every second seemed like an hour. It seemed that it might never end again. The more that she thought about it, the more that she wanted it. The more that she wanted. She wanted a climax but couldn't bring herself close enough. She had to concentrate on her clit.</p> <p>"No," she said. She thought about trying to put that tongue of hers in there but that is just crazy. Her clit is so sensitive. She had never really tried it. It doesn't help if someone touches it or if they get it wet. She always kept her pussy shaved except now she had it trimmed into a short triangle to keep the hair out of the way but she had seen how long it usually takes before it will completely disappear. There still had to be some hair between now and her time in front was over.</p> <p>She got in full on and got her clit between her lips as the shower sprayed from there. Her vagina got all lubed up for the upcoming orgasm as she could feel the suction of her finger at the rightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
