I caressed her soft skin and gently slipped my hand into her tight top. Her beautiful breasts filled my hands. I gently massaged them while she slid her hands down my back while I rested her arms on my waist. My hands slipped beneath the fabric on each side of my waist and began to trace circles on her stomach.</p> <p>Kelly moaned. We broke our kiss. I looked into her eyes and saw that she was smiling.</p> <p>“You are too tempting in your outfit,” I whispered.</p> <p>Kelly kissed me and her hand continued down my back to the top of my ass. She pulled my ass gently in her hands, then slipped one finger underneath the fabric. She slowly slid one finger inside my underwear. She felt me quiver a bit and I had one foot on the couch. She had no idea I was already wet.</p> <p>Laying her hands on my breasts gently, I felt the heat in my panties. She massaged the fabric with one hand and pushed down, freeing my breasts from the bra. I groaned as a rush of pleasure swept through me, leaving me with only a little disappointment.</p> <p>“You’re so beautiful,” Kelly said looking up at me. “I haven’t had a look at you in months.”</p> <p>I took her hand in mine and pulled her up to my lips. We kissed, my tongue finding hers and meeting the warm wetness she elicited from me. I slipped a hand under my panties and began to stroke her through the thin cloth. It seemed like a natural extension of any pleasure she derived from my kisses. She ground her hips up into my hand and pressed my palm into her vagina. Her mouth went wild and her breath quickened. She broke our kiss long enough to take my hand in hers and place it on her clit.</p> <p>She pressed her fingers firmly into my palm. With another groan she arched her back, pushing herself up the sofa. I felt the shudder of a wave as orgasm hit, her lips were open in a silent moan, she writhed uncontrollably beneath me.</p> <p>“Oh my God, that was wonderful,” she sighed.</p> <p>She looked up at me and smiled. She reached down and caressed my cheek, her face looked flushed and her chest heaving.</p> <p>“I think we should get the fuck out of here,” she whispered.</p> <p>“I don’t suppose you have a key?” I asked.</p> <p>Kelly raised her eyebrows. Her face was flushed red with excitement.</p> <p>“Come with me,” she said.</p> <p>I followed her into the hallway. I tried to hold in a grin as we passed the hallway mirror. I couldn’t believe any girl would get into something like that. I just knew I wanted to get our clothes off so I could leave. I pulled off my shirt and sat on the hallway carpet. Kelly’s bra unhooked as she dropped her skirt to the floor and stepped out of it. When my shirt was off I stood before her naked. It was hard to take in my new surroundings. In the hallway mirror you could see everything so well. There were no portholes showing on my smooth chest. There were pylons on my thighs, and I was wearing only my high-heeled shoes.</p> <p>Kelly stepped forward and laid a palm on each of my cheeks. I felt her warm breath on my cheek. With a single finger she traced a path down my neck, the flat of her flat palm, across my chest, down to my breasts with her fingertips. I let loose a sigh from my lips as I felt her fingers tease the tip of my nipple. I tilted my head to the side and closed my eyes.</p> <p>“You’re very beautiful,” she said</p> <p>She began to nibble and kiss my cheek and then moved down to my neck. Her fingertips gently teased my skin along the valley of my breasts, the tips just brushing across my erect nipples. Kelly’s tongue traced my neck and shoulders, my breasts were flushed, I felt her fingertips trailing across my abs, down toward my vagina. I could feel her breath as her fingers traced the folds of my labia. She slid her fingers around—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
