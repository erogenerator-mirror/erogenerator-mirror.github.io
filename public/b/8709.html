I don't have a clue what she did, or even what was going on, but I was really beginning to think about the things I wanted to happen. When she asked me to play some basketball, I knew what she meant. She sat in front of me as a distraction and we played around. We had both been on the court by 8:30, so the game was going by at least 8. She gave me the stink eye, like the baddest asshole in the world. It really wasn't that bad, as her eyes actually got a lot bigger the more I played. We played 3 feet and a foot in and then played again for a little while. At the end of a long session of ball games, she got a little pissed off, told me she never was mad at him, so she couldn't call him a jerk, and it was like that. I didn't mind at all, considering that he had made it an "I want it back" speech.</p> <p>We ended up in her hotel room and she stripped off her clothes before she lay down on the bed. She asked me to undress for her, so I removed all my clothes and she got on the bed and got between my legs. For the next 15 minutes or so she sucked and fingered my dick. She was stroking and sucking so well that when she had my dick fully erected she would stop and get a gob of lube and start fucking me with it. It didn't take long before I came in her mouth. My cock got hard and I was ready to fuck her, so in an attempt to slow down my urge to fuck her I told her to get dressed - as I had other plans. We both started dressing and the only sex we had was when she invited me to play some basketball. So we just played and played and played - except my plan did not work out on her - so that last game we played I had to stop her so I had to leave. The second game ended before I had to so I walked her to the door, gave her the key, and she kissed me goodbye. It was like that for the rest of the week.</p> <p>Monday Morning: We had a great week and when the next game started we got some extra time together so I called in late at night and we got fucked for the second time.</p> <p>Monday Morning:</p> <p>The second time was a little later. I was laying in bed with her, her head on my chest, the covers down to her waist, naked underneath. I had fucked her this morning, right from behind.</p> <p>"I want more."</p> <p>And she reached up to kiss me, not to kiss me directly, but rather to fondle my cock under the covers.</p> <p>"Mmmmmm."</p> <p>I opened my eyes and looked her over, at her pretty, young body, and at her full, round breasts that were firm and full. I slowly stroked her breast, feeling the firmness through the cotton.</p> <p>Her eyes closed and her head fell back. "That feels so good... I love it when you do that."</p> <p>"This feels so good."</p> <p>"You can do anything you like to me anytime... in fact I want to, now."</p> <p>"Oh... me too."</p> <p>I slid the covers to just below her breasts, turned it off and laid there next to her for a minute.</p> <p>"If you want more we could do it after we play again, ok?"</p> <p>"I guess so... but I really like it when you do that."</p> <p>"I'm glad you liked it."</p> <p>"How did you know I liked it?"</p> <p>"I watched it..."</p> <p>She sat up and put the covers over to the foot of the bed, then opened her legs wide.</p> <p>"Mmmmmm. That's nice."</p> <p>"This is so nice."</p> <p>"I feel like I'm in heaven."</p> <p>"Mmmmmmmm."</p> <p>"So what are we going to do now?"</p> <p>"I don't know... just feel like you're totally in charge."</p> <p>"That would be great! But do you think you can do me while I'm playing?"</p> <p>"I don't think so."</p> <p>"It depends if you want to play with me too, and you don't mind if I do?"</p> <p>"No, not at all. Just keep touching me."</p> <p>She leaned back a little and moved her leg up until it was up next to where I was lying. She wrapped her arm around my neck and pulled me in. Then she lay back down, so that she was flat on her back, with my dick between the cheeks of her butt.
