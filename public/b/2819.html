After watching some movie, and talking, Karen had finished her meal. We decided to head on to bed and get ourselves off before I could think of anything else to do.</p> <p>"Let's play a few games, Rob," she invited. "I just wanted to watch you work."</p> <p>"Okay. Go get me a drink first though, I haven't had one in a while," I quipped. "I want to help."</p> <p>"That sounds great, buddy. You seem to like this game," she said as she got up to get the wine.</p> <p>I went and brought the wine out to the living room. As I walked by her, she was still wearing her robe, which seemed to open a little to reveal a lot of cleavage. She got up and walked over to me. She took the wine glass and set it on the bar in front of my lap.</p> <p>"Here's to me," she said. "Now come here and drink it all, I want you to do all the work at some point."</p> <p>"Sure," I replied as I stood up.</p> <p>"Good, now just lift your skirt," she said as she dropped her robe and showed me her beautiful little butt.</p> <p>I did as I was told, and she came up and laid her glass down on the bar. Then she stood up and said, "Come over here, and hold on to the couch for me. I just want to kiss you," as she pulled at the knot in my robe. I went to the couch and sat down, as she came and knelt down in front of me.</p> <p>"Karen, please!"</p> <p>"No," she said, almost with a smile, as she unbuttoned my blouse. "I don't want to just kiss you, and that would be too uncomfortable."</p> <p>"Oh, Karen! Don't do that!"</p> <p>She reached out and grabbed my cock through my pants, "I knew you were a man of few words, Rob."</p> <p>"Karen, that's not necessary," I tried to stand up, but she kept it right on me.</p> <p>"Please don't force me," she pleaded, "let me do this. Please," she added.</p> <p>"It can't be helped," I pleaded as I stood up and put my hands back on the couch, "but I don't want to stop either. Come on, let me get you some more wine."</p> <p>She stood up, and came back over and knelt down in front of me, unbuttoning my pants. She grabbed the waist of them and yanked them down, then threw them away to the floor. She started to crawl up to my shoes, and then stood back up. She reached for my belt and unbuttoned it, then unzipped my pants, pulling them down to my ankles. I stepped out of them and she took my shoes off, and then stood back up a step.</p> <p>"That's much better, Rob. I can feel how excited you are," she smiled as she unbuttoned her blouse, and unzipped it, letting it drop to the ground. She had on a pretty lacy bra, which was quite attractive, as her perky breasts were just sitting there.</p> <p>She had only a thin strap going up one side of her bra covering her left breast, and the strap was about four inches long. I could just see the edges of both of her pink areolas peek through the thin strap. I could just barely make out her nipples poking through the fabric. She turned around, unhooked her bra, and threw it away before pulling her bra from her shirt.</p> <p>"That's much better, Rob!" she said as she dropped to her knees in front of me.</p> <p>She looked over her shoulder and said, "No, it's not necessary! Look, it actually looks better when your cock is in my hands!"</p> <p>"What a perfect idea!" I responded smiling, as I reached down and lifted her up, pulling her up onto the couch and she got on all fours. I got down behind her, rubbing up and down her thigh, stopping just short of her pussy. Karen moaned as she felt my cock slide up and down her leg, teasing her. Then I reached my hand between her legs and started massaging her pussy through her panties.</p> <p>"Oh! Fuck!" Karen screamed when she felt me rubbing her slit. "Your cock feels so good," as her breathing became heavier.</p> <p>Just as she was about to start pushing back on my fingers, I gently eased her panties down over her hips to the floor. I stepped out of them, and then knelt over her, as I sat back on my heels.
