He didn't have much of a chance with women as such, but it was fun to meet someone new with no problem. His sister and my mother, my aunt, and my uncle were all really nice people, very kind and thoughtful. They were also good Catholics and knew exactly what they were doing; they had been doing it for generations. Their relationship was strictly academic and non-sexual.</p> <p>It just so happened that I was home that night: I had decided to visit the University of San Francisco to visit my family, not that I had wanted to leave yet, but I had also planned to go for a little coffee, and to visit the local college.</p> <p>I had a good feeling about my sister and her friends, even though I didn't know them. I had no interest in the men of San Francisco, since I had never met them in the flesh. And I wasn't exactly a virgin anymore, but I did spend a great deal of time at home when I was home, learning what the "hot girls" said at dinner. I'd just graduated from College in June with a Masters in Business Management and was now a full student. I had a job at a large software company, and I had two college classes to finish out my new semester. I had always been interested in the business end of it, but it was still a little boring.</p> <p>My sister wasn't doing as much with me as I liked to be touched, and I'd never really gotten a chance to touch other girls. I figured that I was just too old for this kind of stuff: the older I got the more comfortable I was around guys. I didn't mind the fact that I was young and pretty, but I didn't want to be associated with the "older stuff." My mother would be thrilled that she thought that way, of course. She knew I was a little too old for that, and she'd have my sisters over for dinner every year in celebration of my birthday.</p> <p>I was at home that night, so I had plenty of time before it was late. I had a book in my bedroom, and I had just sat down on my bed and fallen asleep when I heard the doorbell, followed by the sound of a very attractive woman's voice. I was a little surprised to say the least. It took me a second to remember who it is that I'd talked to at that particular moment.</p> <p>"Good evening, Mrs. K.," I heard her say, followed by a faint whisper. I just shook my head.</p> <p>"That's Mr. Bledsoe," she said, shaking my hand.</p> <p>"Oh, hi, Ms. K., not much of a name. Did you and Mr Bledsoe go out for a drink last night?" I laughed. I remembered my friends call me "the little mouse" at school. My own name had been a joke in my family for years - which my parents both liked. In fact, all of them had nicknamed me the little mouse, and we did it a lot.</p> <p>"I'll just bet," I replied. "No real reason for us to be going, is there? Mr. and Ms. Bledsoe have always had an interest in that sort of thing. So is Ms. S. She's older, but I haven't seen her since her sophomore year, a year and a half ago. She can be pretty persuasive, if you want to know the truth." I was laughing harder at this point, actually.</p> <p>"Oh. I thought that maybe you were going out?" she asked. I saw a twinkle in her eyes as I spoke. "Mr. Bledsoe is that your name? How old are we, by the way, Ms. Bledsoe?"</p> <p>"No, no, ma'am! I think that's nice that you ask. I'm not much older than you -" she laughed at me again. "Well, at least I'm not old or younger than you." I couldn't help thinking that her comment was the nicest that I had ever heard her say.</p> <p>"Well, I've just always liked older men, not that I'm new to them." Her voice was quite warm. The words slipped out of my mouth. When I had tried to find another job with some of the other guys that I went to school with, I knew that I couldn't get them in bed. I didn't have much luck with guys, but I made sure that I had their attention. They liked me, they just wanted to get in my pants, as much as they could.</p> <p>She smiled, "Well, maybe I have a friend here that we could hook up with.
