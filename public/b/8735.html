I said. The other, "We were both naked under that rain." Then to Lisa I added, "and they sure looked like you!"</p> <p>"Honey, I don't wear panties under just my skirt!" Lisa said. I gave her a mischievous grin. "You are still wet."</p> <p>"Yes I know, just as soon as I put these things on!"</p> <p>"And that's what you want to see?" Lisa asked.</p> <p>"No," I laughed, "I see the panties so close!"</p> <p>It's possible that my wife's arousal matched the passion and the lust in my eyes.</p> <p>"We still need to get some towels out of the dryer." Lisa remarked. We both looked at the clothes hanging from the overhead rack. On the rack was another pair of thongs. My wife's panties but her short skirt.</p> <p>"This looks like a sexy pair," Lisa said.</p> <p>"Yes it does, baby." But I was still worried about what this would mean. But I was still nervous about watching her. The idea of seeing her getting undressed for the first time excited me. It was the same excitement that I had in the car with our friends. I looked her up and down.</p> <p>Lisa took a towel and quickly wrapped it around her body. "Honey, why don't you take them off." Lisa said. I took more towels. My wife had her hands on the rack to steady her self but it was just a precaution. We did not want to be a third wheel and get a voyeuristic thrill at that.</p> <p>Lisa put her hands on her hips and then looked down. She blushed. "I see one of my panties." The other was still pulled up at the top edge. She pointed at the bottom hem of her skirt. "Do you see that?" My wife hesitated for a moment, then looked down. Lisa pointed again. My penis was now very erect.</p> <p>"I'm sorry honey." Lisa said, putting her hand on top of my erection and turning away to place the towel on the rack. She turned toward me and looked over her shoulder at my erection and back at me again. She had turned to look in my eyes and I saw that she saw my erection too.</p> <p>The next few minutes are not my greatest stories. I try to convey that much and I will try to write the same thoughts, but I can't. They might be a little embarrassing and they might also be difficult to relate to. They might be embarrassing and interesting and exciting.</p> <p>Lisa returned to the line of towels that lay on the rack. As I approached Lisa's door I thought for a moment. "Why don't you use that towel?" I suggested. She was standing with her back to me at the door now. I thought that she knew where it would be the most exposed. "Honey?"</p> <p>"Not another second." said my wife smiling. Her hand was now covering her breasts. She stepped toward the door and then turned back. Her breasts showed a slight bounce around the middle of each slope.</p> <p>"We didn't say a word." My wife said, "That's fine." Then looking at her breasts again, "It's just that you need to be naked all the time."</p> <p>"Honey, there is no one else." I said, "And you know I'm not wearing a bathing suit." I looked her in the eye and thought she was serious. She hesitated again for a moment and then put her arms out, offering her breasts to me. "You know." she said.</p> <p>I took those as her cue to approach the rack. I stood in the doorway way, her back to me, and watched her as she lifted one of her breasts up. I was mesmerized. She was looking back down at her skirt. Again, the hem of her skirt came up to the tops of her thighs. As her skirt slid above her hips, her panties rode up slightly. There was a definite gap between her legs. I saw that she had trimmed the hair there. I wondered if the scent of her sex was any different than her scent. I could almost taste it...and then I heard the door open. My heart was racing. My wife was about to make love to me! Then I heard someone in the next room, a woman! I knew it was Lisa but she looked a little disappointed.</p> <p>"Why don't you come in?" My wife asked me. She was standing at my side again. Without looking at me, she added, "I forgot we had a bathing suit but you might want to wear something else."</p> <p>I stepped inside my door way. My wife's head was level with my erection. She took a step back and took a second and a half or soâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
