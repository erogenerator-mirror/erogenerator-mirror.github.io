He took his time pouring the drinks from the carton and putting the last of its contents on the tray. He watched her reaction as his hands lingered on the table edge before he stood to refill her glass. "This is the perfect way to finish a meal."</p> <p>She grinned and drained her glass to finish it first. As he watched her eat, he noticed a small smile cross her face. She was clearly enjoying him staring at her. He knew that would have to wait until tomorrow. "So, what do you need for dinner?" As he finished his last sip, he leaned down and placed his lips near hers.</p> <p>"A nice meal but maybe a bit more..." Her lips curved up and her eyes opened to him. He was about to kiss her again so quickly when he felt her lips on his, and quickly slipped his tongue into her mouth. She responded by giving him a quick kiss. "Ohhhh," he smiled. "I have an idea." As he pushed his tongue deeper inside her mouth, he reached under her robe, and pulled her closer. As the robe fell off her shoulders, he could clearly see the tiny bra she was wearing. Taking advantage of the opportunity to keep from being obvious, he slipped his hand underneath the bottom of her shirt and cupped a cheek. "Oh." She gave him a naughty smile and let her head fall back. He couldn't resist that naughty smile any longer. He let his hand roam over her breast and then down over the mound of pubic hair. "Ahhh," said she as he felt her bare leg begin to tremble. He moved his hand up and down her leg until he was getting it wet with the slippery lubrication from her arousal. He smiled as her tongue flicked against the corner of his mouth as he took the glass of wine and took a large swallow. "Hmm," he purred as he took his hand out of her panties, and set the glass on the countertop and pulled her against him. He felt her respond as he felt her legs part. He loved the way her body moved when he held her. He couldn't resist sliding his hand up her inner thigh, and feeling the silky smooth satin of her panties against the soft skin of his hand.</p> <p>Her reaction was to slide her lips against his when their lips parted. "We do have time, you look after me tonight," she whispered. "I could use a little help tonight." The tone in her voice made him want to say yes immediately, and he wasn't taking no for an answer. He gently placed a soft kiss on her lips, and looked into her eyes. He wasn't going to rush into it, he loved this woman. He watched as she tilted her head back and smiled. "Do you always come to work dressed so casually like you do?"</p> <p>"I'm not always like this."</p> <p>They had the food on the table in about a minute and he had finished the wine with it. He picked up another glass then sat back down. "Can we order something else before we eat?"</p> <p>"Oh, I guess we have a whole bunch of options here... What do you have?"</p> <p>"Can you wait until you finish your meal, and I'll finish yours?"</p> <p>"Hmmmm yes! I'll be waiting."</p> <p>They were about to start dinner when he heard the front door open in her direction. He looked up to see her step inside the kitchen door, then felt the robe slide off her shoulders to reveal that her bra was also discarded somewhere in the kitchen. As the tray slid out of the dishwasher, she was quickly joined by the couple as they watched. As they started to eat, he slid a hand on her back. "We have a whole bunch of options, I can't afford to wait."</p> <p>His hand slid down between her shoulder blades and the underside of her breasts. As he moved one hand around to cup her breast and caress her nipple, he slid a finger down the opening of her bra. As he felt the moisture coating her nipple, he leaned down and sucked her nipple into his mouth. Her moans became a high pitched whine and he moved a finger down and across the front of her panties. "Mmmm," she moaned.</p> <p>As he moved his fingertip around her clit, he felt her body tremble. As he slowly slipped a finger inside her soaking wet pussy, he leaned closer to her as she continued to lick the inside of his mouth. His finger was able to slide easily into her. "Oh yes, keep licking." As his finger moved inside her, he could feel her body begin to clench around him. "Hah, yes, oh yes."</p> <p>She quickly moved his finger from her clit to her mouth andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
