Yours is right there."</p> <p>He lifted, his penis still firmly enclosed within her.</p> <p>"See? Isn't that awesome? That's amazing. That's what I'm talking about," she said, running her hand down his stomach. He felt her hand, on his penis, caressing it.</p> <p>It wasn't hard to imagine. It was soft and smooth, and still within her, but it was different. It felt different, soft and slick and velvety, and it seemed to get even harder. He had to think about something to explain his erection to her - what was it that she was touching? She moved it a bit faster, moving it in a figure of eight around his cock.</p> <p>"That's...that's...that's nice."</p> <p>His hips moved as she manipulated him, moving back and forth inside her.</p> <p>"Do you like that?" she asked and pushed his penis back from her groin, with her left arm. He responded by pushing forward, forcing his cock out of her and pressing against his tummy. He didn't think he would be able to hold it much longer.</p> <p>"You're going to make me come, right now...and I think I won't..."</p> <p>She stopped him with a kiss, pushing his hand with her arm. They had stopped. His erection was shrinking back into himself.</p> <p>"I'm trying to," she said, looking deep into his eyes. He noticed her breathing, too. He had not noticed it himself, but when they were in the kitchen after dinner, she'd been the only one sitting in the living room. They had always had a couch in the family room during the day, as part of the family. It was the only place that he'd stayed since they'd arrived in Chicago.</p> <p>"I don't care. That's not a problem, or at least not my worry. Just try to do good." She had been silent, but she suddenly put her arms around him and pulled him close, with her legs and arms wrapped firmly around his shoulders.</p> <p>He was too far gone to say anything. The idea that she might be interested was too much of a turn-on. The sight, the feel, the smell, the feel of her was overwhelming. The way her breasts were pressed against his chest was all that was keeping him from going away. He wanted this as badly as she did for him at the moment.</p> <p>He lifted his head from hers.</p> <p>"I'd better go before I explode inside both of us," he whispered as he straightened. She laughed a little at his comment.</p> <p>"You have no idea," she said.</p> <p>"I have, but you'll have to wait for that to happen."</p> <p>She pulled him towards the door.</p> <p>"Oh, and I've got other things under control here," she added as they got out of the room.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" he questioned.</p> <p>"The next time you're in here, and I'm there, I'm going to tell this bitch to fuck off."</p> <p>"She'll fuck you?" he said, amazed.</p> <p>"I've never had a chance with you that way before. You better watch out. There's a first time for everything."</p> <p>"I wasn't expecting that," he said, but it was true, and he meant it.</p> <p>"It's alright, don't worry," she reassured him. She kissed him on the cheek before she turned and started to leave. "Thanks for helping us, sweetie."</p> <p>"Don't mention it," he joked and he was just about to smile when she started in on her.</p> <p>"That was great, wasn't it?"</p> <p>She gave him a kiss. "That would be a very good thing."</p> <p>"If you'll be careful," he said.</p> <p>She laughed. "Trust me, that's my intention all alongâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
