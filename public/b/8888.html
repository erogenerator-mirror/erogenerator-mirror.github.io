You'll go a lot deeper with me than you've gone before. You'll be a better lover. I love being with you. But more than that, I've been feeling like you're the better man." She gave me a smile. "Now, can I finish?"</p> <p>I just nodded.</p> <p>We finished the last of the wine and then collapsed on the couch, completely depleted from the whole evening's events. Then we made love. I had done it again. My dick was rock hard again, she was already wet, and after a couple of minutes of wild fucking it was hard as rock again. I had never been with one of those girls at all before, but having her naked and sopping wet was so...amazing!</p> <p>It seemed to last forever. When we finally came, it was more so than usual. Then we just lay there, me on top of her, her legs open and wrapped around me, my tongue still exploring her body, with mine tasting her with the same enthusiasm I was tasting her with when we first met. Eventually we got up and got dressed. There was nothing else we could do, so we made sure to call it a night. She wanted to see what my "little monster" was doing on top of it.</p> <p>"That was incredible," she said, "and I've never come like that from anything you did before."</p> <p>"We're not done yet," I told her.</p> <p>"Can I stay the night, Dan?" she said, giving a little look at my flaccid dick.</p> <p>"You're on," I said, kissing her. "Come give me a massage, too?"</p> <p>"Oh, I've got a massage for that, too!"</p> <p>I went down on my hands and knees. "I don't need an orifice," she whispered as she sat up and ran her fingers through my long wet black hair.</p> <p>"You should put this on, you know, and give it some air," she said, reaching under and running her fingers down over my shaft, "like you have with your pussy. It'll probably just warm up by now."</p> <p>She turned over and sat up on her hands and knees facing away from me. She reached back and grabbed the towel I had left there to dry while I went back down, and I started on her calves and upper thighs.</p> <p>"Ooh!" she moaned as she felt the heat and softness. I started on her thighs, making my way down to the hair. I got to her pussy, where I started, lightly running my tongue along the edges and opening, until I reached the top, licking around the edges.</p> <p>When my tongue was just the lightest touch, she jumped up off the couch and kissed me. "That's all you've got!" she laughed. I pulled back from the kiss and looked at her, then stuck my tongue into her mouth. She started to kiss me, then pulled away, laughing. "How long have you been looking at my legs?" she asked, still kissing me.</p> <p>"Since you started," I smiled at her.</p> <p>"Mmm. So many years," she smiled. "I was just looking at them from time to time." She lay back down on the couch again and spread her legs for me. She turned around and slid two hands down to her pussy. When she was on her side, she reached down and took my cock, put a hand either side. I put my hands on her hips while she stroked me. She started moving her hips up and down, putting more pressure on my cock, feeling it hardening.</p> <p>When I got to the top of her pussy, she had a hand on each of my thighs, and she moved her hands lower to my balls. She slowly massaged them while looking me in the eye. "Can I...may I?" she asked, moving her fingers over one of my balls, and squeezing gently, then repeated the process on my other ball. "I've been feeling like I was going to come any second" she said, sounding very concerned. "Your thing is so small," she added. Then she slipped her hand under her and stroked her swollen clit. At the same time, she pushed her fingers back against her pussy, and I saw her fingers enter her asshole. "I want to be sure," she told me. Then she turned back over onto her stomach. She spread her ass cheeks and showed me her tight little puckered anus.</p> <p>She pulled back and told me to put a finger in. I'd never done that before, but after the initial shock, I did what she said. I put my middle finger inside and found her clit while I pulled back on the finger with my other hand.</p> <p>She was gasping nowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
