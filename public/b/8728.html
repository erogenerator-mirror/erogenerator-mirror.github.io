He had a strong caring nature about him, and knew just how to please or hurt someone. I loved him so much.</p> <p>My parents came into the room next door on the other side of the office.</p> <p>"Mr. Caine, this is Mr. Smith. Mr. Caine, this is Ms. Hart, Mrs. Hart,"</p> <p>They walked into the room and sat down together. I was a little nervous because this person was my Dad. I had never before meet a man that way. I was sure his parents would get pissed.</p> <p>"So, Mr. Caine, have we met before?"</p> <p>"No, I'm sorry Mr. Hart, I was just passing through."</p> <p>"Is that why it took me home?"</p> <p>"Yes, that's it," and I smiled. I was happy for my big time father. I had never come to the club before, and I knew that he would understand.</p> <p>My parents stood up and hugged me.</p> <p>Dad just held onto me gently, and told me how proud he was making me be the reason they got into this lifestyle. He explained to me that he had wanted to do something like this before, but never had because it just never happened. He could have told me. It just never did.</p> <p>"I'll take this opportunity to thank you properly," I smiled and got up to greet my parents.</p> <p>"Glad you accepted that Mr. Caine, if our relationship has to be very similar, I guess we couldn't be more alike."</p> <p>"I understand that, I'm glad we have an understanding. I know you and I will be very close friends. I'm going to leave."</p> <p>I just smiled and said, well if I may be home now, could you tell me where my car was going? And just tell Mr. Caine where my father and I are going?"</p> <p>"Yes, of cause right now Mr. Caine, I'll be home in two or three days. I'll see you all tomorrow."</p> <p>As I was leaving, I leaned in and kissed him. He kissed me back as I left. He held me closely as I left.</p> <p>The next few weeks started the same way that I had. We would talk, maybe we would find a way to meet for a cup of coffee, no rush on this one. We had been through this before. We even dated last summer when I went through a divorce to try and find someone. We would never talk about our past experiences before we met. He would try and make conversation to me on a more intimate level. I never got the chance to tell him that he was the person I was falling for in the world, that we were a couple and that we were lovers. I think he never thought that I was that sort of person. However, that does not mean that I am gay for he never thought so. He was very much a part of my relationship.</p> <p>It was time for a celebration with my ex-husband's parents, as my dad said "that will be our special time."</p> <p>I was so happy that they would be there to see me, so they could start to see who I really really was. I felt so alone and so sad when I was out on the dance floor with some of my old buddies.</p> <p>About seven, I came home and was surprised and excited again to find that we were not on the dance floor. That has never been my experience and I am glad that I did not get to dance with my ex-husband.</p> <p>When I asked him why he would not come home with us, I have never seen him smile. He has always been a gentleman. I'm happy I told him. I was really happy to be with him on this trip. I also told him about the trip plans I had before I broke up with my ex. I told him just about everything that happened between me and my ex and we will be together as long as we both have the time and will have an open marriage.</p> <p>I had to tell him that I had to get back to him right before I left. It was my time. It is hard on work but when you have to work to keep in touch with your kids, I can't. I would never be able to be a stay at home mother for them or a daddy for them.</p> <p>When I get off the plane I can't believe I am not home. The security is awesome! This was the first time for me in six months. I am sure I will never see them again, especially when I leave the country. It is one of the best places in the worldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
