I guess there's a good chance, actually, that I might meet you.</p> <p>Him: And?”</p> <p>Auntie A: Of course, there IS a chance.</p> <p>Him: And how about you?”</p> <p>Auntie A: Well, no chance at this party. I don’t think I would be as happy as I used to be to be asked out, especially by a man as attractive as you are.</p> <p>Him: OK. Do you have to go?</p> <p>Auntie A. (crying) No, I’m having a late date.</p> <p>Him: It’s still very late and we’re not done for tonight. How about joining me for a drink after the party, by the way. That way, I can see what you have on under your dress.</p> <p>Auntie A: Oh, thank you. But that was a lot of fun. I can’t wait for tonight to end and we can talk again. I’m so glad you told me I had to go to the party tonight.</p> <p>Him: (laughing) Yes, it was fun. I guess I was just surprised at how old you are. It’s been a long time. I’m still working on the costume though.</p> <p>Auntie A: Oh, you’re so sweet. I’m glad you enjoyed it.</p> <p>Him: Ok. When would you be happy to come home?</p> <p>Auntie A: Tomorrow. I’m sorry I left you last night, but I had to work the next day and wanted to be sure you were safe.</p> <p>Him: You’re so sweet, a man like you must want to come home and protect you.</p> <p>Auntie A: Thank you, I would love that.</p> <p>Him: That’s great. I was really impressed at how much you looked after yourself.</p> <p>Auntie A: Ok, when does the party start?</p> <p>Him: Let’s say about 7:30. I’ll tell you what to do, after you get home. I want to go to the bathroom and have a quick shower before my date so we can take the time to talk tomorrow. Don’t forget to bring a robe and a toothbrush you’ve got.</p> <p>Auntie A: Ok, I’ll do that. I’ll be out in a little bit.</p> <p>Him: (laughing) Ok, I’ll be home in about 30 minutes.”</p> <p>Auntie A: I’m not sure, I guess I have to stop by my office before I get myself wet. Him: Ok. I’ll see you tomorrow then.</p> <p>Auntie A: (crying) Oh, I’m sorry. I’ll be home in about 15 minutes. I don’t think I can get myself to go get ready right now. I can’t imagine my date with you being that long. I really feel so lonely,”.</p> <p>Laughing, he hung up.</p> <p>Auntie A (crying) I’m sorry it's been so long. I’m so excited about tomorrow. I have been so lonely to talk after my date with you with you in your sexy dress and your cute little bottom and I needed to be with you right then. I can’t wait just yet because I really want to go and have a drink with you again.</p> <p>He put the door to the bathroom open slightly. When there was some light coming from the bathroom mirror, he saw himself smiling at himself as he looked and reflected in the mirror. His eyes were looking back and forth between his eyes and the reflection of the light coming through the bathroom. The door to the shower was open and the view inside the bathroom was spectacular, with his reflection. He could see the front of the mirror and see his reflection staring at himself. The reflection also was very attractive in that he could clearly see his eyes through the reflection. So his reflection was a natural turn-on.</p> <p>He looked on the other side of the mirror to see in the reflection his reflection holding his hard cock and the reflection clearly showing itself up his dress and his crotch. He felt his own arousal and wondered what his reflection would look like naked.</p> <p>“I can see myself completely in the mirror,” he told himself. “I’m sure I can see everything and if you feel the need to masturbate yourself you’re more than welcome to do while you’re here.�—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
