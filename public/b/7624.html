I couldn't tell if the tears came from his pain or the excitement.</p> <p>My mother's legs trembled as I ran my fingers over her clitoris, my fingers gliding effortlessly through the folds of her labia. "Oh, Michael, Michael, Michael. Please don't stop. More, please, Michael," she whispered.</p> <p>"Shhhhhh. I can't wait anymore, sweetie." I kissed my way down my mother's stomach and felt her tremble with each kiss. As I approached her clitoris I could feel her hips quiver as she began to respond to being touched, knowing that it was the most intense contact we had ever had with one another.</p> <p>My tongue grazed her clitoris before slipping inside her vagina, my hands gently squeezing every inch of her buttock. Her cries came to a frantic crescendo until I could feel her body begin to shake and shudder with each breath.</p> <p>"No, please don't stop, Michael. I'm yours and I'll do whatever you want when you want me. Just please don't stop," she finally panted as I could taste the saltiness of her salty secretions on my lips as my tongue went all the way inside her vagina.</p> <p>My fingers moved deeper inside her; I ran my fingertips over her clitoris as my tongue fucked her.</p> <p>"Michael, I'm coming," she yelled. As she yelled, my fingers were buried as deep as they could go while I massaged her G-spot, pushing on her cervix.</p> <p>She came, flooding my mouth with her secretions as her entire body went rigid. She pulled my cheeks to her as she held me tightly against her.</p> <p>As her orgasm subsided her breathing slowed and she calmed enough to kiss me and say it was okay that I felt like she did.</p> <p>"How was that, my sweet sweet boy? Was it good for you? I can't tell. What you did to me has made me so happy. I'm only glad that you stopped. You're so hot, Michael, sooo hot."</p> <p>"And you're so beautiful," I replied.</p> <p>She put her arms around my back and cuddled into my chest as her breathing began to slow. We kissed and kissed and kissed, until she broke away and said, "I just loved you being so kind to me."</p> <p>"I wanted you to give yourself to me," I whispered.</p> <p>She smiled and said, "I don't know what came over me at that moment but just because I've come into your life as your son. That is one thing that was so special about how we came together."</p> <p>"So what did you do?" I asked.</p> <p>"I got up," she said, getting up from the lounger she was sitting on. "I laid on the bed on my bed, naked, and I laid in the bed while you took turns kissing my breasts, sucking my nipples, sucking my navelbutton, and nibbling my clitoris. I lay there and stroked my erect penis until I came, and then you came and came some more. I loved being able to have you to myself. You're wonderful, Michael."</p> <p>I smiled at her and said, "That would be the first and only time that happened with you, you know. And even though you're still with me, it won't be easy for you to get on with your life. When we start making love again I'm anxious to do some serious thinking with you, but that's the only thing that will make it happen as I promise you."</p> <p>"I believe you but do you not know how wonderful it would be if we did this, too?"</p> <p>"Not so fast. We both need to take care of that. If this is our last fuck before we move on, then we need to take care of things. And we do that together," I said and kissed her.</p> <p>"I like that idea. We'll have so much to do," she said.</p> <p>"Let's get our clothes off."</p> <p>We both got out of the bed, and she took them off and laid them on the floor. She lay on her back on the bed, legs wide open for me. I knelt on the bed, my hand reaching out and spreading her labes and her open labia. "This is why I married you," I said, as my hand went back over her clitoris.</p> <p>"Oh, God," she whispered. "You are so beautiful."</p> <p>I kissed her stomach and her breasts, and she cooed, "More, my love.
