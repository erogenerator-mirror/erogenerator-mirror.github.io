What the hell was that all about?" I sniggered, trying to look offended.</p> <p>"I don't know, I guess it's a game and you always have a right to get excited. It's kind of like watching the movie, only you have to pay special attention to the other person. I can't see you, but you're a hunk in every way, and I can see you're a natural redhead. I have the perfect body for some men!" He grinned and went on. "I think it would be best to keep a loose hat on, you're not exactly modest."</p> <p>"I'm not a man." I said, a smile creeping across my face.</p> <p>"I wouldn't be too worried, it's not that you are a perv." He added quickly.</p> <p>"Oh, I wouldn't!" I laughed, looking at the top of his hat, "It's not that I'm a perv, it's just that I can't keep my eyes from starting at the base, where I can see the whole thing from the right spot."</p> <p>"Well you better get dressed then, we have a long trip ahead of us!" And with that, we were off to the pub.</p> <p></p> <p>Scene 5</p> <p>By D</p> <p>(Thanks to Ese for the inspiration)</p> <p>Chapter 3</p> <p>The first week passed relatively uneventfully as a group and I was looking forward as always to our next encounter. My girlfriend, Trudy was looking forward to our first meeting, which would be Friday night. She had made plans for me to go to a restaurant for dinner, and I felt better when I went. It had been the longest week of our relationship. At the end of it we had agreed on the most important thing. The most important thing was keeping the relationship going. She had suggested I go to the party and enjoy the weekend, which I was thrilled to do. Of course I agreed. Then the Thursday before the party, I was a little apprehensive; I didn't want to get caught trying to make the dinner invitation. I was excited about the idea of a couple of hours with Trudy, and also about the chance to finally meet Alex. Alex's girlfriend at work, Kate, was not my type. She was cute, very self deprecating, and not an attractive woman. Yet I was happy that she liked me and I could finally meet her, and had decided to go for it.</p> <p>Friday night arrived and we had our best friends at the end of the work day. My boyfriend Alex, who was in the same boat, had called a friend in the firm, and that friend (Mike), was his partner and they had been together ever since we had gotten back together after our little break. Mike had been the guy I was attracted to. Kate was my only friend, and had taken me up on my offer to spend a weekend with her, and I couldn't pass up a chance like that. Her boyfriend, Matt, was in town, so that gave me an excuse to go to a party with his friend Alex, and Alex would be the only one of his friends I hadn't dated yet. Alex and I had a lot of laughs about everything from high school drama to college. He was really cute and fun to be around, and I loved how he acted around me. Alex had invited me to the party, and so the thought of going all out drove me crazy. I wanted to get out of the house for the weekend and start some fresh air. I got all the excuses I could possibly imagine; I didn't plan anything, this was all a big fling. I was excited; I was nervous and I looked forward to being there. Finally Friday arrived, and I was nervous.</p> <p>Once Alex and I were in the car together, nothing seemed so strange. We were quiet and talking about nothing in particular for a while, but everything was so serious. I was curious about him. Alex had been my first lover and he had dominated my mind a lot of times before, which seemed to have always surprised me. I was still uncertain how to go about it and what to be honest, and I didn't know my first two lovers really well. Alex was really shy as a person, and I had never really looked at him that way. We had only had a kiss a number of times, but I had caught him a few times during the previous week and once he had been in bed with me and had made a pass at his girlfriend. He had just kissed me, and it had felt nice, and I felt safe in his arms. I really got excited about the idea of possibly meeting the guy. I was excited about being the lucky girl. I was nervous, and horny, but then I realized that I felt like a virgin, and I had given up all hope ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
