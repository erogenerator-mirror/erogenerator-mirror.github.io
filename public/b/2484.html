He asked as he pulled a small leather box out from under her dress. He held out his hand and when she took it his name was painted on the inside of it.</p> <p>"Oh," was all she said as he pulled the box from under the bar, opened the top, and pulled out a small metal disc. She raised her hand, "It's from the jeweler, and I love it!" She took the disc, and opened it. She turned it over, holding it, and looked over the jeweler's work with appreciation. "It's so pretty."</p> <p>"So, I bought it just for you." Alex smiled, "But no, it's perfect, you'll like it."</p> <p>She took off her glasses, and looked at the diamond ring on his finger. "That makes me so happy." She looked up at him and smiled. After a brief hesitation she took the ring from his finger. He moved toward her, taking her hand as he leaned over and kissed her hand. She felt his fingers gently caressing her ring finger before he turned the stone up, and looked at it. The inscription read "I've been waiting for this..."</p> <p>"I'm glad," he said and kissed her hand. "And you're so beautiful." He held her and held her close to him.</p> <p>She felt his hands moving across her back. "Thank you," she whispered in his ear.</p> <p>He looked at the diamond and said, "I think that was the one that caught your eye."</p> <p>"My dear Alex, for me that symbolize the very foundation I would eventually leave me."</p> <p>She hugged him fiercely and kissed him deeply. "Yes, it makes my heart hurt to think about it, but it's so precious to me." She looked over to see his smiling green eyes. "You could be the first man I'll be with for a very long time."</p> <p>He pulled back. "You're a wonderful teacher to me, and very special to my children."</p> <p>"I'm never going to let you go, and I know. You just gave me a chance to become the woman that I feel you would be. That's just wonderful." She closed her eyes, "I promise I'll never forget you." She leaned in and kissed his lips. "You've made me feel that I'm the woman you want. You're the boy, the young man you want to spend your life with."</p> <p>His smile grew. "Thank you, little dove," he said and kissed her cheek.</p> <p>Alex took off his sunglasses, and started to undress, "No, let me turn them back on." She got up and he took the glasses back. "Now sit down, we need to go out for breakfast."</p> <p>They walked out to the buffet, and when she got to the counter he took her hand and led her to the table. They ate lunch quickly and had a wonderful time talking about the past couple of years. He told her about how he had lost some of his old friends after they had moved away from their home town. She told him how his friends and her and several of his friends had come back to haunt her.</p> <p>"Are you and your family gone, yet?" Alex asked.</p> <p>"No, never. You?" she said.</p> <p>"No, we're on our own," he smiled and kissed her. "We'll come home sooner or later." His smile quickly disappeared when she kissed his mouth. "It would be nice of you to come visit me more often, but I really need to make an appearance at your place sometime soon."</p> <p>"I can't say that I want to be anywhere near you, but I'll be interested in seeing where you live." She laughed at his joke, and then turned serious, "I have this feeling that I might fall in love with you again. I want you to know that my heart and soul have been hurt by the way you reacted." She paused looking at his face. "And I do, too. But we'll have to leave whenever we can. I know we can't do anything until we're married."</p> <p>"Will you do anything?"</p> <p>"Let's go visit my folks."</p> <p>"Ok," she stood up and reached behind her to open the door. "I'm sorry to ask you this. But can you say goodbye with your family tomorrow? I know it's hard to talk about all that's happened, but you need to do something for your family."</p> <p>"Oh," he stood and kissed her firmly, "I'll be there. Goodbye."</p> <p>She leaned in and kissed his lips before walking away. He smiled, and hugged her tightly and kissed her on the cheek, "I won't be here too long, dear."</p> <p>She kissed him on his lips. "See you tomorrowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
