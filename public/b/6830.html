Gasping for air at the loss of oxygen, I sat up.</p> <p>"Why did you come?" I asked, concerned.</p> <p>"To get you back, I meant what I said, and yes, I am glad we got this chance to go shopping. But I have to find something in a different area with more people than we have been. So I'm going to be very busy this week."</p> <p>My heart was pounding in my chest, and my body flushed with heated desire. I couldn't imagine anything more intense and intense than what we had done and I had come to realize it was time to move on. My lust was making me dizzy and my pussy ached at the thought of how hard he had been.</p> <p>"Okay," I told him smiling. "You said something about the idea of the different types of shoes you like, and now we'll go to town."</p> <p>I held out my hand to him. "Come with me, I like going to town! There's some really great stuff in the shoe section at the store. If I ever need to take a break from working, I'll take you on. I'll be back tomorrow."</p> <p>I was surprised by his enthusiasm for the change in my life. He seemed genuinely interested in my opinion, as he took my hand and lead me to the fitting room. When I closed the door once again, the soft jazz sounds of the store's closing store filled the air, and when I turned back to look at him, he was already standing in the one door opening.</p> <p>"It was nice to meet you. I hope we can be friends again sometime."</p> <p>He grinned at me, and leaned down to kiss me. Our lips touched and he groaned when they met. I felt his hand slip down to my back to hold me tight to him as he kissed me. I tried to breathe deeply, to keep the music at the high level, but soon felt him press against my cheek, pressing himself and me against the wall.</p> <p>He moved our bodies back against the wall, and pressed me against the cold hard tile. I was afraid of how hard he was pressing against me, as if he might tear our skin in two. His hand moved to cup my breast, and I felt a shiver shoot down my spine. His hand moved to my other breast, and as my breasts pressed up in his hand, he leaned back, and lifted me off the floor. He kissed my hair from my neck and I felt his lips slip down my body, his tongue flicking over my nipples, making them hard in his mouth.</p> <p>In an instant, he was on his back, his hands in his lap, his eyes closed as he rubbed himself against me. He pushed me down on to the tile and lifted me as I sat, his thighs straddling mine. He knelt by my head, kissing my lips again, slowly, letting me breathe with him. He ran his tongue along my lips, parting them, teasing my mouth with his cock, sliding slowly into me, his head touching my belly. He began slowly grinding against me again, using his hips to drive him deeper inside.</p> <p>As he continued to kiss me, I opened my mouth to allow his head to come into my mouth, then closed my lips around him. I sucked gently at first, and he moaned as he felt my teeth scrape his shaft and head. But as he grew more excited by the show, and felt himself swell between my lips, he pulled himself away. He pushed me onto my back, his hips between mine. His hands moved to my hips and he positioned himself between my legs, taking first one then the other of them and pushing them up. His hands held me open as my lower back arched and he began to drive himself into me.</p> <p>My clit ached to be touched, the roughness felt so wonderful.</p> <p>"C'mon, make love to me!" I urged him.</p> <p>He began to pull back, and I let myself be pulled away from him by my hands, as he pushed himself back in with a groan.</p> <p>"I want to feel you on me, making love!"</p> <p>I had always loved feeling him, but being in such an intimate and private act with someone as beautiful as him made me feel like one with him. I spread my legs wider for him and he moved again, this time entering me completely. He pushed in and out of me so slow I feared my first orgasm would be too intense. I could tell he was almost ready to come, and his thrusts were so deep the feeling of his cock rubbing against my clit was exquisite. I reached behind to rub my fingers over my pussy lips, feeling the way he drove into me with each strokeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
