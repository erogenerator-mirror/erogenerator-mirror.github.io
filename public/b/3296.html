As much as they liked to tease, it was never about making each other jealous. It just never seemed that they were interested in each other. However, this was one time they were going to try something new. Not only had they made love to each other the night before, but they had also taken off their clothes and watched each other. So, this was only getting their mind set for a while.</p> <p>"It's a little awkward. But I'll try to make it worth your while," Beth said with a smile and a wink. A smile that both she and Karen couldn't suppress.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sure we can accommodate just about anything," Karen grinned.</p> <p>"I'm sure we can think of things that would make it worth your while," Beth agreed. "But this is my first time, so I want you to know right from the start this is all about being with someone else. As long as it really pleasured you, I'm in."</p> <p>"Good," Karen nodded her head. "Because if it doesn't bring about your feelings, then it is out of your hands."</p> <p>"I know," Beth laughed. "I am not saying I'm done with anybody either."</p> <p>"Don't forget, we still have to do this a lot," Karen replied, giving Karen a wink as she stepped back.</p> <p>"I will," Beth smiled.</p> <p>Beth turned to Karen. "You going to join our little fun, or would you like to leave?" Beth asked her.</p> <p>"Actually, I would, but I'm going to try the new toy I bought and try to get it to me," Karen replied.</p> <p>Beth knew her sister would come up with something to do. "Then you're going to keep this little toy company. I'm going to sit on that bench and watch."</p> <p>"Okay, I'll wait for you if you want me to," Karen grinned.</p> <p>Beth pulled the thin piece of leather that was still tied across her crotch apart, then slowly wrapped it around her waist as she walked. She could see and feel her twin's soft pubes peeking out from beneath the thin leather. Her nipples were slightly reddened in response to the erotic image. She smiled and walked around the bench.</p> <p>"So, tell me about your toy," Kathy finally said.</p> <p>"I guess so," Karen replied. "Since you already know about it, I figured I would tell you, but we got caught up too quickly."</p> <p>Karen started to untie her top. "I guess it's okay if you just keep this on for now," she said with a giggle.</p> <p>"I guess we were still making a pretty good first impression," Kathy laughed. "Come on, let's take a break."</p> <p>"Okay, I guess I won," Karen answered.</p> <p>"Not necessarily," Kathy smiled. "I'll bet you know a trick to make a girl do tricks."</p> <p>"I know," Karen laughed. "It should be fun, but I'm not into tricks."</p> <p>"Well, it is fun," Kathy smiled.</p> <p>"Maybe you should take it out for a spin," Beth suggested.</p> <p>"I think you should try it. I've never done anything like this before. I mean, if it feels good, I might give it a try," Karen suggested.</p> <p>"You sure about that?" Beth asked, getting out of her chair.</p> <p>As she reached for the toy, Karen slipped out one of the leather belts from behind her back. She slowly wrapped the small, silver ring around the base of the metal wand. "I guess that feels just fine," she said to Karen.</p> <p>"Do you need your own wand, or something?" Karen asked, pulling it from its package.</p> <p>"No, just this wand," Beth offered the wand to Karen.</p> <p>"Okay. Well, I thought..." Karen stammered, as she reached down and put the wand over her breasts.</p> <p>"Please, you don't need to say anything," Beth said.</p> <p>"Please just take it and turn on," Karen said.</p> <p>"Okay," Beth replied, her hand still shaking as she carefully wrapped the wand over Karen's breast and started to turn it on.</p> <p>Beth did this slowly, watching Karen slowly turn the wand up and down. She also reached under Karen's skirt with her other hand, finding that her new lover was wearing a pair of underwear with the word "fuck me" embroidered on the front. She could almost see the pink dildo hanging out from under a pair of very thin panties.</p> <p>"This is one of the best," Karen said as she turned the wand higher up, looking into Beth's eyes.</p> <p>"I can't disagree with that," Karen smirâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
