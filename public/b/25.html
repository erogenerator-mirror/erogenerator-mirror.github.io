If you tell us it was the wrong day then we'll know it to be right. But I'm afraid we'll think you're telling the truth and that we're pushing our luck, ok?"</p> <p>"Ok, if you're sure. Now get back to your work."</p> <p>"Thank you, you're very gracious. I hope we're doing this right."</p> <p>"I'm glad you like it, Ma'am. Now be back out."</p> <p>"Ok, bye."</p> <p>She went out to her office and closed the door, locking it again, smiling at herself in the mirror as she went through the same things she had used the first time after she came back to him. After she sat down at her desk and logged away again, she logged onto her computer and went back online. Just as she got back at least eight hours later, she paused at the one button and looked up at him.</p> <p>"Good day, Mr. Jones?"</p> <p>"Good day, Ma'am."</p> <p>"So, I'm assuming you know why I want to hear your answer?"</p> <p>He looked up with sweat on her forehead.</p> <p>"Yes, Ma'am. I know that, right?"</p> <p>"Yes. Yes, I do. And if I don't mind you calling me by your name because I am becoming even now, then yes, you will be called Mr. Jones," she leaned toward him and gave him the most beautiful smile she could muster. "But, I want to hear your answer, first. How was your day, Ms. K? You were just as beautiful today as you were yesterday. Maybe better. You were the type that just walked up off the runway and had everyone look at you."</p> <p>He didn't speak for a long while, just staring at her, still trying to catch his breath. After he was done, she continued.</p> <p>"So, you were, err, with your boss?"</p> <p>"Yes, Ma'am. It was the other night. That was pretty hot that first night. But you were the one that didn't know she was hot. It felt so strange to see it on the way to work. So, I had a late dinner."</p> <p>"Ah yes, that's right. I should mention we had the same dinner last night, too."</p> <p>"I can't remember...did we have sex?"</p> <p>"No, but you don't mind if I do? Besides, it looks like you're ready to blow."</p> <p>"You're not the only one," she said as she sat and stared at him, a smile coming to her face, and she reached down to stroke his arm.</p> <p>"But, it isn't your fault."</p> <p>"Not mine," she said as she reached a hand out to him. "It's mine. I just couldn't help what I did. It was too much," she paused as tears formed in her eyes. "I can't do this anymore, I'm going to tell the guys on the football team that you caught me and you're going to tell me what to do. They will think that I'm a dirty old man to let it be said that way."</p> <p>"I think you could tell they'll take it the wrong way, Ma'am."</p> <p>"And I hope they'll realize that I'm not some dirty old man to let it be said that way. Maybe they'll just believe that you've just caught me and can't imagine what you're thinking."</p> <p>"I think you mean well, maybe some people have. Just for the record, I'll be the judge of whether or not you're telling the truth, okay?"</p> <p>"Thank you, ma'am. I am very sorry, it was my fault that you saw my body for the first time. Don't worry, maybe you'll remember that sometime. But, right now, I'm ready as ever to say something."</p> <p>"Just tell me what to do and I'll follow."</p> <p>"Ok, but it's up to you, okay? Maybe I'll be right here."</p> <p>"Yes, Ma'am. I promise."</p> <p>It really didn't take long until she returned to her seat and began the routine, even giving him a few more minutes to make the first decision he would make about the day, but she didn't stop him. She didn't want to seem too enthusiastic by telling him about her day. And besides, what else could she be thinking this morning when she'd been with Mr. Jones for nine hours? She couldn't tell him that he was wrong. She wanted to convince him that everything that she's done and done would be the best thing for him.</p> <p>She finally ended the shift just before noon, which surprised him. The clock on her desk read 12:45 andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
