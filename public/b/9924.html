They both laughed, trying desperately to regain some control.</p> <p>Alicia, having recovered from her climax, slid back across the bed to kneel beside Paul. She pulled the pillow back away from her head. "Is there a point to this now, Paul? Are you OK? Did I embarrass you?"</p> <p>Not waiting for an answer she lowered her face to his erect cock, and ran her tongue along his glans while squeezing his testicles. Paul moaned with her tongue teasing and sucking his cock, his erection already at its full length. "God, Maggie. I've got to fuck you," he warned. He sat back and grabbed her hair.</p> <p>Maggie, meanwhile, had gone to her knees and was slowly pulling down Paul's shorts. Her hands slid under the leg openings of his shorts, finding his balls and then grasping them in her hand. His cock sprung out at full attention. It was long and rigid – probably 9 or 10 inches, hard as steel. She held it just inches from Maggie's face, rubbing her cheek against the tip as she inhaled in response to the taste of the blood. The combination of her warm breath and her soft skin on his cock turned him on. He reached out and gently caressed Maggie's head. They fell into a deep sensual kiss while taking turns taking turns and licking each other's tongues.</p> <p>Maggie knew she was about to get her chance. She had never done oral on a man before, but her instincts seemed to be the perfect match for Alicia's. She looked up, trying to decide what she wanted from this man. She loved him, but sometimes wasn't she getting what she wanted? She opened her mouth, taking in his head and working her tongue along its underside. She took him in, sucking while he held her face steady.</p> <p>Paul's hips moved in time with her bobbing head, his hands pulling on her hair as she swallowed his cock. He had the most intense pleasure from the experience, from the feeling of softness and warmness. His body tensed and his eyes closed as he felt the warmth inside, as Maggie worked her tongue up and down the length of his shaft, tasting his pre-cum. He felt like the first man alive in the world, except for his dick. He felt like he could cum and ejaculate at the same time. His dick felt like it was going to explode in Maggie's hot mouth.</p> <p>Maggie sensed that he was ready. She took him slowly from her mouth, dragging his cock along her cheek and up the front of her neck. Her tongue and lips tickled his glans. When she was licking the tip she took the crown in her mouth and sucked, massaging the shaft with her tongue, running her tongue around the head, feeling the ridge.</p> <p>She felt her hand move slowly, dragging over his balls. In her mouth she took his cock out, taking the entire head in, pausing. She slid up and down the shaft, then sliding down till he was entirely inside, the bulbous end against the opening of her throat. She lifted up and went down again. This time she held still feeling him deep in her throat, then slid back down his shaft, sliding up to the sensitive ridge under it. Paul was watching her intently – the sight of his penis in her warm mouth brought him to full hardness; but not enough to make him cum. He wanted to feel her lips wrapped around him, stroking him as he fucked her mouth.</p> <p>Maggie slid up and down on Paul's cock, taking him deep into the back of her throat each time she slid up till she was touching his pubic hair in her throat, then slid back down. Paul's hips ground into Maggie's, urging her on. She could hear him breathing harder, trying to thrust his cock into her mouth, to fill it with his cum.</p> <p>She moved up slightly, stopping to massage his balls while she continued riding up and down. Her own arousal built again, her excitement rising while Paul watched appreciatively. She took a finger and slid it into his anus. At the same time, she slid her finger in and out of his rectum. Paul let out a groan that shook the entire room.</p> <p>Maggie was about to move faster when Paul whispered, "No, Maggie. I want it up here."</p> <p>He grabbed her hips and pushed her down onto the mattress, then rolled her over on her back. He stood up between Maggie's wide open legs, holding them at the ankles, and plunged his cock deep into her pussy. He began fucking Maggie with long strokes, pushing them from her waist upwards and up over her stomach, then working the head down again. As he plunged into her he ran his tongue from her neck down to her pussy. Maggie's body thrashed under his attack. Her arms were—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
