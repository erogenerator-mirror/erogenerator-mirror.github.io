Slowly, deliberately, she moved towards my lap. On her knees, her hands came up and encircled and cupped my face in her hands. She kissed me hard on the lips. Her tongue darted out to caress mine, sliding easily into mine. Her hands squeezed my thighs gently, as her eyes closed tightly together. Her lips moved and our tongues tangled together. She kissed and nibbled on my lips and my tongue, each time her lips and tongue explored them. Her lips opened and we joined to dance and dance together.</p> <p>My face was on fire. Her lips sought me, her body felt soft and alive in my hands. I ran my fingers down her back, feeling the texture of the lace of her bra, her skin. It felt so soft, so smooth and wonderful in my hands. The straps of her bra fell loosely down her shoulders, falling in a curtain behind her down to her upper arms. I ran my fingers gently down the outside of her cup, moving them lightly over her skin. Her fingers moved over mine, softly tracing the edge, as if to show that I wanted her to touch me all the time. She slid her hands down my arms to my shoulders. Her fingers gently pulled me to her and I felt her breasts pressing against me through her brassiere.</p> <p>My hands moved down, caressing her hips, thighs, and ass. I felt her skin under my fingers, her curves firm, warm, and tingly against my fingertips. She was soft, warm, and sexy to the touch. Slowly, she unclipped her brassiere and laid it gently down to the side. I slid my fingers underneath her panties, slowly feeling the thin waistband of their lace. My fingers slid lightly inside the lace for just a moment. I felt a quiver in her body, her thighs quivered as I did it.</p> <p>I ran my hands along the back of her panties, slowly down her back to the top of her ass, where her thighs met. I could feel the softness of her undergarment as skin slid under the lace to the middle, where it met the bottom edge of her buttocks. She shivered as my fingers gently pulled her panties past her ass and down her legs as she lifted her left leg to slide it off her right. I could feel the skin of her inner thigh, but the lace was so soft. I pulled her panties down past her ass, making the fabric of the panties fall in small hanks around her hips. I slid my fingers along the skin along her cheeks, pulling each upward and inward each time. Her thigh moved back as my fingers pulled it free.</p> <p>With her body still trembling, I pulled her panties down her legs, tossing the last piece into a drawer. She slid off the bed and stood, as I admired her. She looked so pretty naked. Her eyes closed, her mouth opened up, and the lips of her sex were inviting me to suck on them. But I didn't, instead just stood and held my hands in front of me, looking down at her legs. Her body quivered, her eyes slowly rolling down my body. I moved my hands up her thighs, and gently caressed her thighs as I turned her around, pushing her down onto the bed on her back. The pillows under her ass were soft and welcoming and welcoming, as she wrapped her legs around me.</p> <p>I kissed her breasts slowly, feeling their softness and gently licking the top of them. The nipples felt like little pencil erasers peeking between my lips. I moved down her body, kissing her thighs and stomach, which had turned to goose-bumpy cheeks. My lips slid into the curls of her pussy and I began licking her slowly, gently. My lips slid off her pussy, and her legs tightened around me.</p> <p>My mouth closed over her pussy and my tongue slid inside her, probing. I slid it in and out, feeling her fleshy folds, her wet flesh. She opened her hips to mine as I licked around inside her, feeling the wetness that was there. She was moaning now, as mine did with hers. I slid my middle finger quickly inside her wetness and she shivered as I felt her muscles contract around it. I slid a second finger into her as my lips began to circle around hers. Her muscles quivered and she moaned deeply. I felt her fingers tightening themselves into my hair as she ground her wet pussy into my mouth. The feeling was incredibly good, I was so turned on, so ready…</p> <p>I pulled my fingers from her, and slid them between my lips, sucking them into my mouth in turn. I ran my tongue—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
