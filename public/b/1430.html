The two of them leaned over me to untie me. I felt a sharp prickling and a jolt through my body as they clamped clamps on me and I flailed helplessly on the bed. "You... you... are not to... go... anywhere... until... you... cum," I said.</p> <p>"No," one of them said. "Don't worry! I've been through all the same types of pain this time! You had to get used to it, didn't you?"</p> <p>"Oh... yes... I... I... yes!"</p> <p>There was another sharp pain and I squealed, twisting and thrashing and trying to get away.</p> <p>The woman laughed, and I saw teeth, but I couldn't tell if it was in sympathy or sadness at the thought of being used to this humiliation.</p> <p>"Now that's a lot harder to obey than I thought it would be!" I heard a voice say. "She'd probably slap your mouth to get you to do what I think you're going to do!"</p> <p>The woman's voice grew more forceful. "Come on! You're going to cum! You're going to cum all over my cunt! You're going to cum so hard that you'll wake up in a huff!"</p> <p>I felt a huge prick as my vagina was penetrated and another and the third and four fingers twisted inside me as the pain took over and, to the pleasure of their touch, my body began to convulse and shake and buck with another intense orgasm.</p> <p>"Oh-ho-ho," I heard the second woman, "Now, now. That's a good start!"</p> <p>The pain had subsided and I was feeling better. I'd had more orgasms in four years than I'd ever had in my entire life, but this one had me on edge of having enough.</p> <p>Both the women were whispering in my ears and running fingers across my lips. I felt hot wetness, lube, and my own fluids being forced out of my vagina as they pressed their fingers inside, stretching me further than I'd ever been and sending waves of pleasure through my body, along with a strange, weird mixture of pain and pleasure. I felt them kissing me and exploring me while simultaneously exploring every nook and cranny and crevice inside me.</p> <p>I began shaking and jerked uncontrollably and they began to caress me and massage me and stroke me. I felt some small sensation as my vagina was penetrated and the two women began working some of the soreness out of me and they began kissing me more deeply. The pain was subsiding and my mind was clouded in a deep, almost foggy, euphoric state.</p> <p>I felt the woman at my head push the head of her sex against my lips, and it felt so deliciously sensuous, so erotic. It was a small, thin phallus and I was grateful that such was a sensitive part of the male anatomy. I opened my mouth and gently kissed the top of her sex, as she began to press. This was a bit different from what I'd been doing with the other woman, since I knew it would be an unfamiliar experience but, as my mouth closed around her slit, my heart and mind and even my cock began to race in excitement and anticipation, and I began to lose control of myself. With everything in my mind and body on fire, I was overcome by a new kind of pleasure and reached out to run my hands along their bodies all over the others parts.</p> <p>Both bodies were becoming even more turned on and slippery with the juice of their pussies as the two women pressed against them, pressing against my mouth and mouth and hand as the two women caressed and petted me and my sex and my body and their skin and souls as I knelt there on the bed, with the two women kissing me, fondling me and fingering me and teasing me as my own body was overtaken by the intensity of this new level of pleasure that it seemed that the two women were taking me to even greater heights of ecstasy.</p> <p>The woman to my head, pushed down hard on my shoulder and I felt the wetness of another woman enter me and begin pressing against the tiny opening of my womb. The feeling was very different, and I began to experience a new kind of pleasure and then the feeling of another woman's skin and fingers against my vagina as the two women pushed themselves firmly together as the small plastic cock rubbed and pressed against my vulva. I felt like it was a strange sensation, and wondered if they really fit and if they really wanted to have sex together after this pleasure, as I wondered what they might do together.</p> <p>I could feel a sudden surge of excitement as I felt the two women kissing me while feeling my most private of openings.
