He was always around, usually having the time of his life. He was not a prude, not always, but he didn't have an open marriage. He was a good man, he had a wife and kids, and he didn't have a wife to take care of. He just had a strong belief in himself.</p> <p>"What happened last night? If I had that much power over people I could control them in any way I wanted, I'd just do you. All I was doing that night was that."</p> <p>I took the lead, "I know that you have a lot to offer, and that is what I'm offering to you now. I could give you power over your wife. You can see it. She was so good-looking, her blonde hair, her beautiful eyes, those high cheekbones, everything... I could control you. All you have to do is go through with it."</p> <p>He stood, "You are so wrong." He took my hand and led me into the dark interior of the church parking lot.</p> <p>He led me through the kitchen, up a flight of stairs into the second floor and into an office room. He pressed a button, and a large white screen closed over the large windows, and he closed and locked the door behind us. He took off his coat, and he hung it on a hook on the wall. He took his clothes off first. He wasn't a little boy anymore. He had a body built to please. It was a wonderful body, from what I could see. He was a swimmer, but he wasn't bulky. The body I had been worried about was nice, but something had changed. It wasn't hard. It was like in his old body. It fit, he didn't change it. He was still a boy, but the muscle tone was gone, there was an age. The body was still firm, the bones were still firm. He started to remove his shoes and socks, and he let his pants fall to the floor. In his old body he was still very muscular and toned. He took off his jacket and laid it on a chair. I took off my shirt and trousers. He kicked off his loafers and unbuttoned his shirt. They hung down like a man's on his knees.</p> <p>He removed his shirt, undid his buckle and his slacks and let them fall to the ground. He was naked, and there was a small patch of brown pubic hair at the base of his erection, just below the base of his cock. I leaned forward to kiss him.</p> <p>He ran his fingers through my hair, down my spine, and down the outside of my thigh. I gasped when his finger touched the opening to my virgin cunt. This would hurt at first, but he didn't stop there. Within seconds he was inside me, he didn't stop there, he fucked my body with that small finger, slowly, carefully, until he knew that I was ready for him to claim me. Slowly he began to fuck my pussy, fucking me with his finger, while I kissed him. He began to fuck harder and faster, until his finger became a blur inside my body. The pace increased. He began to move faster, almost thrusting, faster, harder, harder.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, fuck me, fuck me harder, faster, oh, god, oh, god... oh... oh yes, fuck me, fuck me," I screamed as an explosion rocked my soul. I was crying out loud, I couldn't stop it and he could too, and I screamed and screamed and screamed. My orgasms shook me and I lost consciousness. And then I was still. I was lying there on his desk, naked, sweaty and shaking, with my hand wrapped around his cock and my legs around his ass. I was exhausted, happy, excited. He was still inside me when I woke up again. He was on top of me, his dick still hard inside me. I looked around, naked, lying on his desk naked, naked, and naked, but the desk looked like something from a film film. I couldn't move, of course. He got up and I looked around again, I was too dazed to do much. I saw him on his knees between my legs with his dick rubbing my cunt. He pushed up off me, stood, pushed me back on the desk with my hands on the desk, and he took his dick back in his hand and rubbed it up and down my wet slit, then he lined it up, pushed, and began to push his cock into me. It wasn't so big, just a little bit bigger. He stopped and held himself inside me for a moment. I smiled for the first time that night.</p> <p>I lifted up a leg and began to rub my clitâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
