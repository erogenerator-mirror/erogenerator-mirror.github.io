I've missed this." He began kissing his way down her neck, down her chest, down her belly, where his fingers slid between her folds. She lifted her hips and his mouth could hardly touch her wetness.</p> <p>His kisses tickled the insides of her thighs, and he finally moved his face and moved his mouth in close to her. She moaned, and her hands fell to his hair at the top of his head, pulling it to her.</p> <p>Her fingers, then moved down to his hair and he began to run his tongue across her, first up the side of her nipple, then down the underside of the other. He reached the tip again, wet with her juices. Then her other tit.</p> <p>This time, though it was more of the same, she moved to meet him, arching her back, her leg wrapping around his hips and pulling him toward her sex. He found himself in her, sliding easily into her. She was wet, tighter than she'd ever been. He began to move in and out, as she rose and fell in rhythm, her breasts pressing into his chest. Her hips moved up and down as he moved in rhythm, her hands holding the back of the sofa for support. He was moving faster now, deeper, deeper, and she was pushing toward him, almost lifting her legs to wrap around him but not quite.</p> <p>Her cries grew louder, and her movements became more frenzied, until the rhythm was gone.</p> <p>"That's right, sweetie! Now you're making me come, baby," she cried. Then she collapsed, her hair wet with perspiration, panting heavily.</p> <p>He rose up and kissed her, then got on his knees in front of her and began to kiss her stomach. Her hands ran up his thighs.</p> <p>"Oh, baby! That was so good!" she cried.</p> <p>"I'm glad you liked it, baby."</p> <p>His hands moved to her waist and he began to push down toward her.</p> <p>"That's it! Fuck me now!"</p> <p>She lifted her body up into a "V," and he was inside her in one motion. Her lips were pressed to his as her hips slammed down back at him.</p> <p>His cock slid all the way in her as she wrapped her legs down around him, his arms around her back. He lifted his weight, holding and raising his weight and began to pump in and out. He began to rise, but her thighs held down on him and she began to stroke upward toward her nipples. Her eyes went wide as his head turned to one side on hers, still thrusting and pumping, his tongue lolling out to the side.</p> <p>As his own breathing started to accelerate and she moved her hips, he drove himself deeper into her, then back down. His arms tightened around her, and he thrust himself into her again and again.</p> <p>"Now, sweetheart! Come for me!"</p> <p>She was going up and down on him, pushing her sex back and forth on his now-hard cock. Her body twitched, and she squeezed her legs. She was shaking now, her breath coming in pants now. Her moans turned more desperate. She was so ready for it now that when she felt his cock spurt and feel the stream of hot come inside her, she screamed.</p> <p>His hands, holding her in place as he thrust himself into her at the same time as hers did, kept moving, and they began to move with the rhythm of the lovemaking.</p> <p>Her hands tightened on him. She was going faster, and harder, and she loved how her arms shook as she fucked him. He began thrusting as well, deeper and harder. It was no longer the frantic fucking; now it was the hard, animal fucking. They were fucking and fucking!</p> <p>Now it was just her. His hands were all over her, touching her, fondling her. His hips pushed harder and harder and deeper into her. But he couldn't last any longer. She felt it -- that moment where she felt that she had the capacity to fill herself up with whatever might come along with his discharge.</p> <p>He stopped to catch his breath, then began to move. She came again, as he did. As he pushed himself deeper than his previous strokes had been, she was crying out loud. He leaned back and pushed her body back into him, while thrusting himself in her still. She was still climaxing, then he came again.</p> <p>He felt her legs tighten around him, her face twist into a grimace, her body bucking and writhing as her own orgasm began again, her arms still holding down on him. Her legs squeezed around him, and her nails seemed to dig into his back just a little. She began to sob again.</p> <p>Then silence descended.</p> <p>They lay there for aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
