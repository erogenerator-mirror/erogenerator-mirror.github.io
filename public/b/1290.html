That’s a great way I can say I didn’t really enjoy a man. I just like to play with my pussy and think about a sexy stud. And it’s one of my favorites.”</p> <p>She said a bit more to me. She took a step closer to me as her hips pressed against mine. Her hand slid away from my dick and she started to rub my thigh again and whispered.</p> <p>“You like my ass?”</p> <p>I nodded emphatically. I thought I heard a gasp, but I had to assume that’s not the case. She reached around front and undid the straps to her top. Her tits sprung free. She reached behind her and undid the clasp on her bikini bottom. It fell apart and her ass was round and high. Her pussy was neatly trimmed short, but it was pinkish red. Her pubes were closely cropped. We both felt a stirring in our pants as we looked at each other’s body.</p> <p>She took in all of my cock as she looked back at the screen. Her fingers stroked the top of my balls. Her other hand reached under the elastic band and she wrapped her fingers around my cock as she stood there, leaning back against the chair and rubbing me. She was watching the TV with me. When she finished doing that, she turned around and slid her bikini back into place.</p> <p>She stood and turned toward the screen, pushing her firm tits back together with her hand. Their size seemed disproportionate to the firmness of her breasts as she moved around. They were smaller than mine but seemed to defy gravity. That’s when I noticed a long, long tattoo of a heart near the left shoulder tattoo on her inner thigh. I reached my hand out but didn’t come up to her. She took my hand, putting it on her belly.</p> <p>Her hand went back to its task. I could feel her heart beat through my cock. I kept my hands close enough to feel the muscles in her back. She had a narrow neck line. Each of her little freckles seemed to tickle my palm. I wanted to make love to each. I slid them along the sides of her tits and her nipples started to tingle, but she said, “It would kill me if we were caught.” We weren’t exactly the sort of friends that would go around being nude on our friends laps.</p> <p>I leaned in enough to whisper in her ear, “Don't worry,” and I was smiling at her. Her eyes went wide. Her eyes looked as wide as I had.</p> <p>I leaned forward and kissed her earlobe. Her mouth opened and her tongue snaked out to meet mine. We shared the kiss. Her hands started to stroke me. Her breasts swung slightly in the tight bathing suit top. If anyone had to have known, maybe that would explain her nipples.</p> <p>We broke off our kiss. Her mouth was red with excitement and she pushed her tits harder against my fingers.</p> <p>“I think they might have a heart,” she murmured.</p> <p>“How does it work?”</p> <p>“Well…they seem happy. Are you?”</p> <p>“I think so,” I answered. “I’m not really sure. I think I’m going to lose interest in what they look like.”</p> <p>She smiled.</p> <p>“How do we do this?”</p> <p>“That’s an easy enough problem for me to handle. I’m comfortable enough with you that no one but me will know. I want to be your girlfriend, so I will just tell them I’m on holiday with my boyfriend. I’ll be home about six and I’ll come over every weekend. You have to come too if you want to do this.”</p> <p>I leaned over and kissed her ear. I said, “I’m going to get my water.”</p> <p>After my bath, I cleaned up and dressed without a word. I didn’t wear my panties. I took the only item of clothing they had left. My shorts and shirt were in the washing machine, but even with the washing machine on, your clothes would still be dry. I was looking forward to going home to my husband, our children and my husband. I told myself I could still get to my bikini and leave.</p> <p>Later that day, we walked through our backyard. There was a path leading down the hill to our yard. There are little trees to cover my property. The pool was screened by a small area of grass and there were no other bushes to spread my tan. It was a beautiful day so far—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
