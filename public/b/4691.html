A lot of things I wanted to say and I never got around to saying it. For months I was a total stuck-up shit and I wanted to leave here, but I knew that would be too difficult; I couldn't stand seeing my parents and brothers again. That's why I agreed to spend the night at their place tomorrow. They had only a bedroom, and no one could find me. I was not going to let them throw me in jail. I wasn't going to wait for the next day; I could get caught!</p> <p>The next few days were very hectic for me. I knew that at some point this summer I was going to walk or skip, but right now I just wanted to go over and meet my parents. The last minute meeting with my family was no easy, but what I had wasn't. I had to get up early tomorrow to go see them, and then it would be time to make my move. At first I was scared because I had a friend that I didn't really know, or at least never met, and I never tried to hang out with her. But when I looked at my family, I saw that there was some kind of spark between them that I wasn't looking at. I had no idea if it was because she was a good friend or because she was hot or both. I had been a virgin for several months, and that didn't mean that I didn't have expectations. But seeing her would have to be something that I took for granted.</p> <p>I couldn't believe it when I saw her, because I knew that she was hot and that they weren't going to be disappointed. Her body was as perfect as I had imagined, and the way she held herself and moved made it look as if it were modeled after the real thing. God she was beautiful; no, not in a sexy way, but she was definitely there, and I was willing to die and leave her the hell alone. I had been with several girls, and only a few that turned out to be as hot as she was. Hell I had watched a few porn tapes and I liked to imagine the action in between, and I guess that helped. I couldn't tell which movie she had watched and as bad as the girl on girl stuff was. It didn't count. Was I that good? Maybe too good. And then she was sitting on my bed in my underwear, and I could see her looking into the camera as she looked at me. Damn, what was she doing?</p> <p>My mind was going numb as I thought about what she had just done. And my cock had gone rock hard and I was getting harder and harder by the second. I could see in her eyes that she actually liked what she saw and that she wanted more and more. If she was going to do it to herself that much of it was going to be for show, and then she would have a chance to do so many more things before we had to face what was to come. Even she knew that. But even at that age she still didn't know why I would be so turned on by making love to her. Even in the darkness of my room I still took a mental note of what she looked like in her underwear. Her soft skin was tanned all over, and it was obvious that she wore only skimpy, transparent cloths.</p> <p>The problem was that I couldn't just go on and do what she was doing, or maybe I would be just as turned on as she was.</p> <p>But then, she had never been with a woman before. And so now I was going to do that, for all she was willing to give me. I wanted to try but it would mean losing the opportunity and losing myself totally in her. As much as I hated to admit it, I just wanted to fuck her, not do it for one night, but she was so nice about it. And when I tried hard enough she would even encourage me to go faster or faster, or anything of the sort. But in just one night...I was going to do that. I wanted the first time to be great, and she would never believe that she would want that. Damn, what else could I do?</p> <p>So I had to walk back to my dorm and hope that I didn't walk right over and make love to her. As it was, I found myself just about half an hour away. I quickly ran to my room and lay down on the bed trying to forget about what had just happened. I was on fire; I wanted to do that again, but the excitement of what she was doing was too much, and I knew at any moment that I would find out that something had happened there, so I closed my eyes and tried to relax.</p> <p>Finally my eyes opened andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
