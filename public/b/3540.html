"I can't do my own thing with your mom."</p> <p>"No need," he said gently, pulling the spaghetti strap on my nightie off quickly and tossing it to the ground. "It goes on."</p> <p>The thin blue material hugged my body and hugged me tight, the thin material sliding smoothly over my flesh. I felt so exposed and nervous. I knew this would be awkward but as the night wore on and it became darker, I was feeling a lot more comfortable. I felt very alive and the feeling of the nightie rubbed against my bare skin. The cold morning air felt wonderful, it made my nipples tingle. My whole body was tingling. I felt very wicked.</p> <p>"I shouldn't be doing this," I said feeling even more nervous. "I can't afford this."</p> <p>"You're not staying at your mom," he said with an impish grin. "The more you think I'm going to get the better your answer will be."</p> <p>I thought it odd that after what he talked about earlier, he wouldn't say any more. I knew what I was feeling. This whole thing was new. We'd never done anything like this before. And in all honesty, there was only going to be this when I got home. I had a lot of work to do before I could take it any further.</p> <p>That wouldn't be all. My parents were going to be on the phone when I got home and they hadn't returned since all of the noise on the night before. I was going to be alone for awhile. I was going to have plenty of fun with this man.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to go? I've been trying to get you to come over."</p> <p>"I would very much prefer it this way," he said. "There's nothing like a hot young woman."</p> <p>With that, he was out of my house. As I stood there in the kitchen, my mind started to race and I kept thinking about what had happened between us the previous night. I didn't like it. I didn't have the confidence I should have had. I mean, I've had a lot of girls, it's not every day, especially not with this new man I met earlier in the day. Still, I was still curious about what it would feel like to have a young man being all over me with his naked desire. I'd just been waiting for this. Just sitting in my kitchen looking at the kitchen table and wondering if this could actually be a turning point in my life.</p> <p>I looked at myself in the bedroom mirror. I was beautiful. I could easily have just gone to my grandmother's house and told everyone what happened. All of the old family would have been upset but I'd grown up and I couldn't just leave if that was what the old people would have done.</p> <p>I turned back to my kitchen and started to make our breakfast. My stomach made a sharp thumping noise in my ears and I felt something stir, almost like a sexual arousal. My body reacted to it. I could feel my body tingling. Something stirred in my stomach. I started to feel a stirring in my own body.</p> <p>It was becoming more and more erotic and all of the anxiety was draining from my mind. I felt like I was being a movie star in a new movie. My body trembled. I let out a long low growl. I knew I hadn't been able to keep this beast of an animal in my throat very long but the thought excited me even more.</p> <p>It must have been very embarrassing standing there with my back straight, my dress pulled high over my breasts, holding a bowl in my hand and my bottom pointing straight out. The feel of the cold night air on my bare skin only added to my excitement. I was feeling a kind of euphoric state. I was feeling sexual and I was feeling a little scared. I was afraid that if I let go it would be over. If it didn't happen, if I did what my parents or the people that lived in our town, things might get worse and I didn't want to have them to know.</p> <p>I wondered if I was still a virgin when the door opened and a man walked in. For a moment I stopped cold, feeling nervous. What if I lost my virginity. What if I couldn't let go now? What, what, what if I did get turned on?</p> <p>The man, apparently his name was Jack, was about my size. He was about 5'11" and very slender with short black hair and his face was slightly round with a slightly thin nose. He looked a little young and had a slightly crooked smile on his lips. His body wasn't overly muscled but it was very toned.
