"You know, if that's what you were asking yourself, I'd like to stop right now," I laughed.</p> <p>"No, I just thought I'd enjoy watching the fireworks," Amanda said, smiling widely.</p> <p>"And all the sexy things you were going to do," I added.</p> <p>"Well, there are a couple of things that I just want to see now," Amanda said, looking at the other guy's crotch.</p> <p>"I thought you said you weren't going to give me any oral until I was in my last month of college," I said, standing up.</p> <p>"Why, yes I do," Amanda said, kneeling in front of the other guy. She started to unzip his pants and pull out his stiffening pole, staring intently at the large bulge. As she pulled on the thick shaft, it stood out impressively behind it.</p> <p>After a minute or so, the guys pulled from the pile of clothes and got back on our feet, standing a few feet from us as soon as a hand shot at Amanda.</p> <p>As she stood up, I grabbed her by the hair and pulled her back towards me. The other guy walked away and picked up the pile of articles lying on the bed of our clothes and carried them towards the door. Amanda and I took a moment to just stare at each other, Amanda leaning into me as I grabbed her shoulders and turned her toward the bed. "Are you sure this is a good idea?" she asked, standing up.</p> <p>"What makes you think we're going to stop now?" I asked with a playful grin. Amanda's breasts pushed against my chest with each step she took.</p> <p>Amanda's eyes shot to the other guy in the doorway and he was standing at the edge of the bed with his shorts around his ankles. Amanda and I looked at each other as I spoke and she smiled. My expression turned seductive. "Why don't we get naked," I said.</p> <p>Amanda leaned over the bed for a moment and took in the sight of our naked bodies. As we glanced over at each other, Amanda looked over my shoulder and said, "You know, I've been dreaming about fucking you."</p> <p>"I'm sure we could do more than that," I suggested with a grin. Amanda nodded her head and reached out to grab the bed sheets. We were both now topless and each guy took another step towards us.</p> <p>When Amanda and I had laid out and moved across the bed, she leaned against the wall with her hands resting on her stomach on either side of one of us, leaning against. "I've always loved your body," she whispered against my ear. I gave her a quick kiss. "And now I want to fuck you again," she whispered back.</p> <p>"You know, that was the hottest thing I ever did but it seemed like it would work just the same," Amanda whispered.</p> <p>"It sure did," I agreed. My hand reached for her breast but she pulled it back and let me do it. "It feels like your body's on fire right now," I whispered back. "You're so sexy."</p> <p>"You have NO idea how I want to fuck you right now," Amanda whispered. "I need you right now." She moved slightly off the wall towards me and laid her head down. I got to my knees by her side and ran my hand over her ass, letting my fingers stray down each cheek.</p> <p>"Please fuck me," Amanda whispered. "I need you right now." She lifted her leg and put it over mine, opening up to me as I got back onto the bed with her. I lowered my head down to taste her sweetness as I guided my throbbing manhood into her. Amanda gasped and moaned out my name as I started slow to tease her. Our tongues danced in every corner of each other's mouths before we finally broke apart just as our passion had peaked.</p> <p>Amanda was smiling her sweetest smile as she ran her fingers across my shoulders before leaning up and kissing me. "Your cock feels incredible."</p> <p>"I could get used to getting a piece of that."</p> <p>"It's not just a piece of it," Amanda added. They both smiled and pouted at the same time. "But before you go do your thing," Amanda said, turning to the guys. "The one guy is the one that wants to take care of us, but I also think it would be best for him to watch while I get my manly treat." She looked around the room and said, "Just so long as I get a piece of this tooâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
