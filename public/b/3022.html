She'd just started to get her ass fired up off the high street, even if it still cost her two nights out here, which was what she was going to do tomorrow. Her mother had already left her alone downstairs, and she'd probably have a long, hard day tomorrow. She couldn't let her daughter get a double date.</p> <p>"Alright then, I'll drive you home," the big black man said. "We can have a glass of wine first, and have a quiet little chat."</p> <p>She smiled at the big black man and agreed.</p> <p>"We can make a dinner together, right?" she asked after they sat down. "You get us dinner?"</p> <p>"Yes, of course!" the big black man said with a grin. "And don't make me go home, because I'd just fucking kill you if you did!"</p> <p>"It's your turn, mister," Dakota replied. "Now you get us dinner."</p> <p>"I just got a call and a text from a friend," he said, picking up his cell phone. "I'll pick it up after I get you home."</p> <p>He turned on the speaker and dialed a number. "Hello? Who is this?" he asked.</p> <p>"Kelsey's father. Yes, she's home. Hello, are you okay? I'm glad you could make it. You can stay the night if you like, but I'll tell your wife when you get home. I'll make sure you get home safely. Goodbye. Goodnight," he spoke as he finished speaking, and Dakota nodded.</p> <p>"Goodnight," she said sweetly, and hung up. "I just gotta get the car started up, and you can go get it cleaned up."</p> <p>"Alright," the big black man responded. "I'm taking the girls and the car tomorrow morning. Thanks."</p> <p>"We're staying for dinner," she explained. "We're just taking your girls' clothes. I'll get them."</p> <p>"Uh..." the big black man's voice trailed off.</p> <p>Dakota paused, considering herself in the mirror. A small part of her wanted to just get out of there, but she had her own life to lead, even if she didn't have much experience with women, and she had just been in an odd place for so long. She was starting to realize that, given what she had heard about her father, he might not even be her father.</p> <p>Dakota didn't trust most of her friends in the past few years, and that scared her. It might seem strange that she would just be acting the little girl and not having a father, but Dakota found that she loved it, and if a strange man wanted sex with her, she certainly would let him, just like she had.</p> <p>She had made it to the top of her weight list, and had only become a couple of pounds heavier, but she wasn't sure why she was feeling that way, or why all of her feelings for her mother had grown. She didn't care for her mother at all anymore. There was another reason that she realized her father had turned her down, one that only made sense because she was his daughter.</p> <p>She was so lonely, and yet at the same time, she was so afraid of what she might do next. She felt dirty, and dirty because she knew that she might not be the person she realized she was when she graduated from college. She wasn't used to feeling like this about other people.</p> <p>She had never felt anything more than love, and something similar to that was the reason why she had let her father touch her. He'd always come home after work, and she'd never let him go without a fight, or a way to make it up to him. He'd always made her feel wanted and needed, because of the way he treated her. There was always something to be done in that way, and if someone had to be punished, even for doing something for them, what would it take to make them feel want again, and right?</p> <p>Dakota started to feel a little guilty, just so she could finally let her father treat her like a woman, something that she liked, but even if it was wrong, it wasn't anything her mother had ever made her do. It was just her father's thing.</p> <p>The truth was, for a lot of it, it wasn't the sex. He just did things to her like she wasn't any sort of man. Maybe he didn't do it when she was in college, but he always made her feel sexy. He made her feel special and special, and that was always there before. The way he looked at her, the way he touched her made her feel like that, and he was alwaysâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
