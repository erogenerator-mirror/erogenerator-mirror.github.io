A little bit rough, but not really that bad?"</p> <p>"Not a bad pain reliever. But you've got a little too much weight on that one."</p> <p>"I think so. I can't explain it but once my muscles get used to the new girth, it really starts to feel good and when I sit down, I can sit for about 15 or 20 reps. That thing is like a machine after a long day. The friction of it makes me want to sit for days and that tightness is amazing. I just feel like I'm going to go into cardiac arrest when I get up there."</p> <p>"That's my advice," she said looking at a huge bulge in her pants. They couldn't help but keep staring at it. She reached for an empty beer on the coffee table and turned on her music, hoping he wouldn't notice that she was wearing no top. "Wine?"</p> <p>He smiled. "Wine sounds good."</p> <p>And a moment later he was in a club with a dozen or so girls, all looking at him hungrily, each giving him a chance to kiss her.</p> <p>One of them was probably a blonde; another was a brunette whose body looked like it was out of fashion. He had an enormous bulge in his jeans.</p> <p>After the girls at the club had gotten him drunk, they'd made him dance with them.</p> <p>At one point, he'd gone back to the bar and was back by this dance floor grinding with them, as well. Every time they danced, he'd grind into them as well. He liked these girls. They were so sexy and sensual. The next dancer came over to him. He was just dancing with her, enjoying the feel of her body with each body part. They moved in sync, sometimes grinding together. Then she would move off the dance floor and he'd catch himself dancing with her in the parking lot. The way he was dancing with her was like the sexiest thing you could imagine. She'd move in and kiss him, always smiling and touching his face. He'd start to turn around to see her and she'd give him a smirk as he kissed her. This pattern continued throughout the rest of the night. He hadn't lost his buzz to her, since his friends had been watching her on the dance floor. She was the sexiest thing he'd ever seen. She kept glancing over at him. Some of the girls at the club were looking at them as they worked their hips, their chests. It was almost like they were dancing together in the middle of the street. It was pretty clear that she'd liked the attention she was getting from him. She walked out of the club with him by herself, holding on to his body for stability as she held him tight against her hip.</p> <p>And when she was done, she held him close to his face and they danced. Her body smelled so good. The smell of sex and she danced for the whole bar, and then they went back to the table. He was so out of control, intoxicated. They were all on the dance floor, grinding so hard, and the girl on the dance floor was so hot and so full of energy that she had to move her hips wildly to keep up with his grinding. They finally stopped, leaving the dance floor. He was in shock and awe all over again. He felt so out of place. He walked back up to their table and looked at her as she sat there. She was glowing, and he felt his dick move out of control. He kept his eyes closed. He looked at her. Her eyes were closed tight and her lips were slightly parted, and they looked so sexy. Her hair was in a long loose ponytail and it pulled free from her neck and flowed over her shoulder. She smiled up at him, her long auburn locks splayed across her upper back. He wanted to come back to this spot so badly. She had this smile on her face.</p> <p>After about a half hour, they decided to go home.</p> <p>He was so drunk. She held onto him even more tightly, as they walked to their cars. He grabbed her as they walked, but couldn't even talk to her. He took her hand and they walked with him out to his car. As they got out, he kissed her hand and she gave him a smile so he couldn't control himself and let out a soft passionate moan.</p> <p>They got in his car and it started to roar with his heart. It had been close. He closed his eyes, and didn't see the smile on her face. They got back from the bar and sat next to each other on the couch, his head just level with hers and his hand rested lightly on her thigh.</p> <p>"I can't believe we did that.
