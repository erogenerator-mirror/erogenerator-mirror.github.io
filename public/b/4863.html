Her expression must have been a mixture of sympathy and anger.</p> <p>"Yeah, I know. I'm just surprised that you didn't come home with her."</p> <p>Buckley said nothing back. He looked around the room, seeing that he could see Jenny and Bryan were looking at each other and grinning like idiots as he walked to the kitchen. It was a small smile that could never be hidden by anyone else's.</p> <p>Jenny and Bryan were having a drink and were laughing as they talked about the upcoming awards presentation later that day. That little smile made Benny a little jealous. For some reason he was feeling a little guilty for being with a woman who he barely knew.</p> <p>He poured himself another glass of iced tea, took a sip of his, and looked out the window again.</p> <p>"This thing in the garage is going to be so awesome. I'd like to get my head in the game and play some pool tonight. We don't get much in the way of entertainment, but we can be comfortable. No worries.</p> <p>"I just came in as the team's all star player." Jenny said. "No kidding! It looks so cool!"</p> <p>Buckley could see that Bryan hadn't said goodbye yet and wondered how he was going to react with Jenny and Bryan's little game going on in the background. He had thought so, but now he had no idea how it was going to go.</p> <p>"Yeah. Bryan's the one from last year. He's a big fan of ours. What about you, is that a bad thing?" Benny asked.</p> <p>Benny thought back to all the attention he had felt on the girls and said, "No. Not at all." He grinned.</p> <p>"He's still coming to meet the team and, as you can see, he's very well-connected and we've been invited to go out sometime. He doesn't want to be too old for us, so we'll have company." Benny added.</p> <p>Benny felt himself blush again at their frank talk and said, "That sounds like fun."</p> <p>"Sure," Jenny said.</p> <p>Benny's heart was feeling heavy as he stood at the sliding glass door leading into the kitchen. He didn't know what to do or say. He didn't really like the idea of going outside with the team today and wasn't sure if he should stay or go home. It hadn't taken him very long to realize that Jenny and Bryan were his friends and he was just being polite.</p> <p>Before he could protest, Jenny came back into the living room. She had on a pair of light-colored tank-tops and a simple skirt which she buttoned up with a couple of button-ups tied around her midsection. She was, Benny guessed, 5'11", 120lbs, a tiny little 32b, and had a big round round ass. That made her midriff and tummy, where her arms went on her breasts, look even bigger.</p> <p>Benny felt himself start to blush. He wanted to reach out and touch her and feel how beautiful she was without any kind of barrier. It was so easy. Jenny knew what he was thinking and didn't give him a chance to do anything about it. She said nothing and continued putting the coffee on.</p> <p>Benny was feeling rather uncomfortable sitting alone in the living room. He had to get away. Jenny and Bryan had gone out last night and this morning and it wasn't entirely his fault that he wasn't around.</p> <p>Jenny's face appeared on the window sill. She was on the sofa with her right arm wrapped around Bryan. He thought about looking to see if he saw Jenny's face. He wondered if the girl at the other end of the pool would have noticed. He saw her looking at him a bit, which might have been a reaction that might have set something in motion. Maybe.</p> <p>Benny took a deep breath. He didn't want to embarrass himself by looking at her this way and just went ahead and crossed that line.</p> <p>"Hey, Jenny." Bucky said. He didn't sound as though he meant anything by the term.</p> <p>Jenny stood up and walked toward Bucky. She had a tight little body as well, which she seemed to be looking at every time she approached him. He could see that she had big shoulders and large breasts that pushed out her tank top. He knew how men felt when they felt they had a woman to hold the shoulders of a women. Jenny's nipples were rock hard in her thin top.</p> <p>Jenny walked up to Bucky like the other women did. She was practically naked in her shorts, which looked kind of tight around the waist. And her nipples almost seemed to be pointing directlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
