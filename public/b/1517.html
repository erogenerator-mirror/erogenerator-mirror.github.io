I groaned, as I heard the door opening downstairs.</p> <p>"Mom."</p> <p>"Oh! How was your first day of school? I thought you would be excited."</p> <p>"I was. The teacher brought in a special teacher. He made the class of the year. And when it did not, it became very difficult. I was the only woman in the class and he was the only man in the class. If he found out, I was fired. I thought he was going to make a joke on us, but he smiled at me.</p> <p>He was in his mid-thirties, and not bad looking. He had blond hair, and a nice body. He was about five and a half feet tall, and in pretty good shape. I would never have thought he could get me to do that. A young woman would have to be well aware of its benefits.</p> <p>"So, you just came?" I asked, in my slightly embarrassed tone.</p> <p>There was a little silence. I felt like he was looking right through me. I started to get mad at him, then realized that it was not the man. It was the one from the day before.</p> <p>"Not just today. Today we are going to get a chance to be together. It is time for you to be my partner in life." He was looking at my face. I could see the wheels turning in his head and the desire of what he had to do to me overtaking his words.</p> <p>He rose and went into the hallway to go to his office. I was about to come, and started to get excited.</p> <p>"Dad. It has been a long time." I said, thinking to myself, I would have done anything for my father. I was not sure that what he had done for me, if anything, was truly loveable.</p> <p>We had some small talk, the most important being how I would do it. I started to think about how he felt about me, how he had made me feel, and his desire to have me. In his heart as well as in his head, he would always want me. It was my father, and I was his new wife.</p> <p>"You don't know what it's like to be married to a woman you have never even seen on television. You are never going to be the same woman you are, you are never going be the way you are. Dad, you are the first man I met. I can not tell you how long I have wanted to be the woman you are becoming."</p> <p>He had not told me much about myself, but he had told me many times that no one would ever be the same person.</p> <p>I was in love with him. Not just in his first love, but in his love for me. The day had never been a very good day, and now, at thirty years of age, he was being my partner.</p> <p>He asked me a simple question and I answered. "Dad, you never told me much about yourself."</p> <p>He said nothing. He had never told me about himself, and yet, when I was around him, how he was so different from any other man was hard to fathom. I was shocked by all of this. "I guess you could have told me about me." I said, trying to ease my self to know what it was that he had always been hiding from me.</p> <p>"That's right, but it is hard," he said, "I have never been inside anyone so sexually active before. It is hard with you, and I never found out where to bring you."</p> <p>"It is hard," I said, "It is not about sex, and more, when being married I can not feel that."</p> <p>"Oh, my God." I was thinking, "You have never been married before, you should never have brought me to the sex. Don't you have a wife?"</p> <p>He said nothing. He just smiled. I didn't know what to do. I was not in the mood to talk about it with the man I loved but there was the part of me that wanted nothing to be said. Was it love, or passion? I had never had such a strong feeling of love from my father.</p> <p>We went back up to his office and got him a cup of herbal tea and sat in the small arm chair on his second floor office.</p> <p>"There is something you said to me the other day that you wish you could do in your life. So, I am going to ask you about it and then I am not going to answer questions. What did you say that you wish you could do in your life?"</p> <p>I had to swallow hard to keep from laughing. "You want me to ask you something?"
