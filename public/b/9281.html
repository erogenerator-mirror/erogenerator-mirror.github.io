She then told me to go out on the patio and to lie on my back across a small sunbed, with my head down on the small piece of grass about a foot away. Then she took the camera, tripod and some light cloths out of our bag, which I saw was on a small table nearby. She then came over and got a new pair of very sheer panties from her own bag.</p> <p>"Go ahead and take them off", she said with a mischievous grin.</p> <p>I quickly peeled them off, and she did the same, both now without any other clothing. I felt completely naked with my clothes on and completely turned on.</p> <p>"That was nice" she said again with a wicked smile.</p> <p>"I don't know if I can walk in these" I protested.</p> <p>"Come on, just lay in the sunshine, I'm sure that will be a lovely way to get your mind off being naked".</p> <p>I lay down on the sunbed. The wind had picked up now, and all my limbs felt stretched and taut. This time, I also felt a warm glow from the sea, and the gentle breeze on my naked body. I felt totally naked and free of the world.</p> <p>Then, I heard someone outside. It turned out to be the young man from the grocery store standing there with an enormous grin on his face.</p> <p>"Hi! I'm John. I'm from the grocery store", I said to him.</p> <p>"I know that you're here", he said as he shook her hand." I have a present for you" he told her.</p> <p>I knew he felt I was now at the cottage of a friend of his, and I smiled and said: "Thank-you" I responded, trying to act as if I had no worries about him seeing me.</p> <p>"He just said that he thinks you're sexy", she said to me. Then she said, "You just lie there and he'll take off your clothes and then we can go on a sail boat".</p> <p>I was surprised by this, but not in a bad way. It seemed to me that she knew what I would be doing all this time, and that was good to know for a young male.</p> <p>I felt a tug on my hand for the bag, and the young man, or a woman if you will, told me that her bag was empty.</p> <p>Next was another tug, and this time the young man, or woman, took my shorts off and then slipped them on, leaving me naked with my semi hard cock sticking out.</p> <p>Next was another tug, and I knew it was coming. And then she turned her head to me as she stripped off her t-shirt, revealing her young, firm tits, which were topped with hard nipple points.</p> <p>"Well you are in for some very nice scenery this time", she said to me as she undid her jeans, and slowly pulled them down and off her legs and feet.</p> <p>"Now for some fun", she giggled to me as she got back on her sunbed, with just the panties on underneath.</p> <p>"Can you see anything?", she asked, still staring at my naked body.</p> <p>"Not much" I answered. "We'll just see if there is anything else around there", I said.</p> <p>"Yes, there's something on the island", she replied. "I'm not sure about what I'll see there for a moment, but I'll see what I can do".</p> <p>"Hmmm. There's a lot more than just you and me naked with our cocks hanging out", I said, as I started to lay back down with my head by the edge of the sunbed.</p> <p>"Good.", she said as she went to her bag and returned with a huge glass of lemonade and some lemon, which she took down to the ocean floor.</p> <p>This was as much fun as I had fantasized about it as I sat there in my sand-covered sun-bed, enjoying a drink, and being totally naked with nakedness!</p> <p>"There you go", she said to her friend, who was leaning forward in her chair, and looking closely at my now very exposed body.</p> <p>"You have no idea", she said.</p> <p>"Let's do something about that" I could hear the woman say to her friend, who was looking closely at my semi hard dick now.</p> <p>"OK", she agreed.
