I snapped into the other shoe. "I was going to be your girlfriend tonight."</p> <p>"I got my head into the game tonight," she snapped back. Then I gave her a quick look over at me.</p> <p>Her eyes were sparkling. A look I could only describe as hungry, but it really was a look of hunger.</p> <p>"I'm sure you're hungry, too," I said. I knew I was about to leave, and she really didn't know if she should. But I didn't care. She still hadn't found a place to put her arm around me to hold me. The game continued.</p> <p>I kept on putting the shoes on until we were in separate directions. "Want me to put up a token or two?" I asked as I went to my car and we started off towards the mall.</p> <p>"You look like a bad character," she mumbled. I guess I got too loud, but I kept on going, and I think she finally noticed.</p> <p>"You aren't like your boyfriend," she said as she sat down next to me. "You're a decent guy."</p> <p>"You're on the opposite end of the universe," I added in response. That caused her to giggle. She leaned in and kissed me, not quite on the cheek, and my lips opened slightly to let her in. We kissed lightly for a few minutes, and then I stopped, looking at her.</p> <p>She was smiling, and I swear I could see her lips moving.</p> <p>"Oh, God," she said. "I'm so horny." I leaned in and said the exact same thing.</p> <p>We stopped the car, and walked to the mall. It had an array of clothes, lingerie and other stuff. All of which were expensive. Some where not quite as expensive as hers, and we were really getting into the lingerie.</p> <p>"You're the hottest girl here tonight, too, I bet."</p> <p>"Amen to that," she smiled.</p> <p>"We have the night to ourselves," I said.</p> <p>"You're not leaving?" she said.</p> <p>"No. I'm sure. In fact, I wish all the people on the beach would have taken me in. It's an interesting way to go," I answered. I could feel her smile, the way she looked at me.</p> <p>We made our way to the men's wear department, and I started looking at clothes. She looked at the shirts a little more often than most. I didn't know if it was because she wasn't dressed like me, or if I looked as good as the clothes, but the more of what she put on, the better. Finally satisfied, we picked up our purchases, and I led her to the clothing store.</p> <p>The first thing I did when coming out to buy my things was put on her skirt. My heart stopped in my chest. I was so excited. My pussy immediately got wet.</p> <p>"Do you want to change?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah," she answered as she sat down, taking off her jacket. When she looked up, her eyes grew wide. She was wearing a pair of light blue lace panties that were almost as skimpy as her bra. I wasn't sure whether it really was lace panties for her or her boyfriends underwear for them, but I was surprised at how much she looked like her boyfriend as we kissed, my tongue entering her mouth, and her legs crossing around my waist.</p> <p>The next thing I knew, I was sucking her nipple, and she was moaning, her legs going up and over my shoulder on either side of me and going higher as I went. As she got louder, a small part of the truth of that lie started to come back to haunt me. I wasn't sure if she had a boyfriend, or if she didn't. I couldn't be sure either. But the fact that it was her that I wanted to do this with in my entire life, and that she had someone to go to, and that we all wanted to do this with, was more than enough to turn me on for the life of me.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah!" she moaned as she came. The way she grabbed it, the way she arched her back, the way she bent over the bench in front of me, it was all the way to the end of this kiss. If it looked like this, she would've been naked on my couch in a second, and then the world would have gone a thousand shades of red.</p> <p>As we stepped out of the mall, I knew she was looking at my eyes, and she knew she had the entire picture memorized.</p> <p>We pulled up into the house, and my father and mother went inside. My brother ran to his car and got back to the game room. I followed his assâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
