He kissed me softly then and said; "This is the time you can stop thinking about everything. We will be together, this is our anniversary, you will have the whole night to enjoy us." He held me close to his chest then and said; "We'll get you ready for school on your own."</p> <p>"Oh, I think the first part of it is almost done." I said, kissing him again and walking toward the bed. He put his arms out to me, held me as I climbed back on the bed. He began kissing my neck and caressing my breasts with his hands.</p> <p>"Oh baby, you are the most wonderful thing I've ever felt. I've been with a lot of women and I can't describe the number of times that you have kissed them but you turn me on so much. I like it. It's like I could kiss you forever."</p> <p>"Yes, of course I know, you must be feeling pretty good to be feeling this good with me." I smiled at him and kissed him again.</p> <p>"It is not just you that I feel good about. I think I'm in love with you," he said.</p> <p>I turned back to him, kissed him again and said; "I wish we could spend the night together, it's a special occasion for me,"</p> <p>"Me too, and just you. What are your plans? We'll see them on the flight," he said, looking at me and pulling me onto his chest again.</p> <p>After a little time playing around the fire we got up and walked along the beach hand in hand. He looked at me then and kissed me. "Are you ready to do what you would like us to do?" he said after we did some exploring for a few minutes.</p> <p>"Yes, I guess I should take care of a lot of things and I'd like you to take care of me, too, but we have only been through three different positions."</p> <p>"First we must try two positions," he said.</p> <p>"How do you mean?" I asked, surprised.</p> <p>"I'll show you and make it more interesting for you to try to understand."</p> <p>"I guess so," I answered.</p> <p>He kissed me gently on my neck then whispered, "Let me show you one of these and I'll go slow, I have to do this slowly." He kissed my shoulder and then my neck and then licked my collarbone then nibbled and caressed it a little. "I love to hear you say it."</p> <p>I just laughed softly and said, "You do know that it would be the best place to start!"</p> <p>"I feel the same about you. This little experience was wonderful," he said, smiling at me.</p> <p>"I didn't know," I said, kissing his ear.</p> <p>He put his lips on my cheek and blew on it, saying; "I feel the same about you. Let's practice for the next round."</p> <p>I got up and went back to my position on the bed with my head resting on his chest. We just lay there and let the emotions wash over us. I kissed his cheek, then lowered my head to kiss him again. He put his hand up to my neck and began to caress me all over, as we kissed. "I love you so much" he said again.</p> <p>"I love you too," I said and then kissed him on his lips. We kissed some more and kissed some more. I pushed myself up on my elbow and looked at his face.</p> <p>"You are looking so happy again. The feeling is like a dream come true. What happened?"</p> <p>"I don't know, but it's very nice. I was just trying to make a sense of how lucky I felt."</p> <p>"Is there anything more we can try today?" he asked.</p> <p>"Only about one thing."</p> <p>"What is that?"</p> <p>"I'll tell you when we get ready for school tomorrow, okay?"</p> <p>"Okay, but let's let our time get away and let our feelings build with time," he said as he lifted his head.</p> <p>I laid my head back down on his chest and we kissed softly for a moment. Then I began to play with his chest with my hand. "You're going to have your hair cut today," I said. "You'll do it in two minutes so we don't have to go back to school after lunch.</p> <p>"I would have the whole evening and lunch all to myself," he said.</p> <p>"Let me help you?" I asked as I got up and went to my clothes box.</p> <p>"That might be easier than you think."</p> <p>"But it is going to take a bit to get backâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
