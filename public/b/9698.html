"I'm Sara," I answered, "and you're?"</p> <p>"I'm Andrea." She said.</p> <p>We both smiled at the same time. We were identical twins, and I was the exact opposite of the one in the mirror. We both knew they looked exactly the same, but I could tell from our movements that the difference was only between my face and hers. The difference between the two was almost too much to handle.</p> <p>"What a difference!" I giggled. Sara's eyes seemed a little brighter, and I felt her hand on my waist as she looked down to the top of my pants; and I smiled.</p> <p>"You're pretty hard right now, aren't you?" She smiled at me, and I nodded. "Are you really happy?" She asked. I looked down at it and grinned at her, blushing a little.</p> <p>"Yeah." I answered, "a little."</p> <p>I leaned forward, and then leaned back against the door of the stall as I lifted my shirt up over my hips and off of my head. Andrea grinned as I did that, and then stood up and began undoing the buttons of her shirt. "That's a nice shirt," she said, and I saw Sara reach to pull off her shirt as quickly as she could, and then she just stood there as I undid her button and took it off of her with my shirt.</p> <p>"You have beautiful breasts, Andrea." I said softly.</p> <p>"Um..." Andrea frowned slightly, and Sara stepped back in front of me and began taking off her shirt. I reached up and wrapped my hands around her shoulders as I leaned forward and brought my lips to hers.</p> <p>"It's not fair," I said, "for you to look up at me so much as you do this."</p> <p>"I don't care," Sara said, "he's a hot guy, so don't think I'm being judged. I just want to give you a little show."</p> <p>"Just a little..." Sara tried to say, and I was about to say something else, and Andrea's body language betrayed her, and I kissed Sara harder than I had ever done before.</p> <p>"This is fun, Sara," I laughed, "but we should go back to what we were doing before." I stood up again, Andrea and Sara still standing there, and led Andrea by the hand and towards her desk, where I dropped her on the seat and reached for the lock and key. I sat down on the desk and set the lock down. "That was fun, really?" Sara looked across my shoulder at Sara and laughed lightly, "I can give you a few tips when I leave now," she mused.</p> <p>Sara stepped to Sara's chair and motioned her over towards us. Sara sat, me next to her on the edge of the desk, and then began unbuttoning Andrea's pants. I watched them slowly part, revealing a little more of Sara's naked skin than anyone else's. Sara pulled the jeans down, exposing Andrea's thighs and the lower part of her pussy, which was still covered by a pair of very dark panties.</p> <p>"I'm surprised I didn't see that earlier," Sara said to me as she reached her hand out to touch my crotch. I leaned over to kiss her, and she leaned against me, pulling my mouth down so that I could feel my lips on hers as I kissed her. I could feel Sara's hands on my stomach rubbing and massaging me, and she pressed her body against me as she pushed my zipper down, freeing my dick from it's tight confinement. Sara ran her hand up and down, making it swell up and hard against her stomach. I moaned a little as I felt her fingernails scratch lightly upwards in my pubic hair, and then as her fingers reached the base of my shaft, which stood up straight as Sara worked up and down the underside of my shaft. I felt Sara begin kissing her way around my throat, and as she kissed her way to my ear, she began to lick and suck on my neck and the upper part of my cheek as she gently pushed her tongue into my ear.</p> <p>"I guess that's what you call this," Sara said to myself as she pulled down the zipper of my jeans and freed my hard cock, which was already pointing a very hard and angry toward my belly. I reached for, then felt Sara's hands, and slowly brought up her top, and then cupped both of my hands around her small tits. I could feel the nipples grow hard against my palms and my heart pounded against my chest. As Sara's fingers began to work my cock, I could see her pink, swollen nipples pressing against her shirtâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
