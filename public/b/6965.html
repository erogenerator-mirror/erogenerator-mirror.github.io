"Come over with me."</p> <p>He was still naked.</p> <p>When they entered the living room, she noticed his clothes were not neatly folded or arranged on the loveseat.</p> <p>"No, he is wearing the one thing we had in reserve. You can put your clothes on the other way. No need to look or anything. I should be home by now so the kids will be over in a few minutes."</p> <p>She had changed, too, and pulled back the comforter over them. "Come on, take a shower. I'll just go out to get dinner for you." And she went upstairs and into the kitchen.</p> <p>She came back in a moment later wrapped in a towel. She looked him up and down. "You're not going to say no are you?"</p> <p>"Are you saying anything else?"</p> <p>"Not that either yet. Just, just do what I said."</p> <p>She smiled, "That's a good answer." She took his hand and led him into the bathroom. "You were right to say that we were going to have to make this a lot wilder." She took off the towel, and stepped into the shower after him. "But as good as your clothes are we might need more."</p> <p>In a minute they were laughing and he had stripped. She had decided she didn't want to spend any more time around him.</p> <p>"That's a great idea," she said. "And now we can go back and change."</p> <p>The water continued to run.</p> <p>She turned on the shower and stepped in as well. She turned around and bent forward and grabbed the shower seat. She lowered herself to her knees.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want this?" she asked.</p> <p>"Just do what I say. I can't get more comfortable."</p> <p>"Okay but I don't have that big thing on. I might need to stand up on the seat."</p> <p>"No, you're going to need it," he said. "It's the handle of this soap bottle. Here, let me show you."</p> <p>The soap bottle was at her feet. It had a smooth sheath that fit around her ankle, wrist, and hand. He lifted her up and set her on his shoulders. His cock was fully erect. She started to object, but held it with her hands. "Are you sure you want me this way?"</p> <p>"Yes," he said. "But take the shampoo and soap off. This is going to be difficult because my hands are still slick from the soap. Besides it's nice and slippery so just keep on. I want to be able to do this while we are having dinner."</p> <p>She took the soap and stepped back, but lifted her legs up. Now he had the upper part of the shower seat on his shoulders. He knelt down and she felt the soap slide down her calves. After a minute or so of this the soap was gone.</p> <p>"All the way down!" she said when he lifted her by the ass and pulled the front up. His tongue was deep in her pussy. He began to work it, in and out, in and out. The water had made them shiny, although it hadn't soaked them completely. It made them slippery and the suds felt marvelous as the water ran down their bodies. And soon the water was streaming off of them and down the sides of the soap bottle. It ran down the middle of his shoulders. She had felt his chin go over her vagina and down the outside of her upper thigh, but she did not feel it as it traveled to the top of her pussy and back again.</p> <p>"Oh," she said when she felt his tongue on the outside of her thigh. He began to use his own soap, not as the soap. She was not surprised that it tasted so good, but she never had heard it come from her pussy or from a pussy that had never had a tongue that was lapping at her.</p> <p>"Turn around," he told her.</p> <p>He lifted her bottom off of the shower seat and stood up. She reached inside the shower holder and took the bottle of shampoo he had given her. He was right in front of her. She was in the water and he was in the seat, so the angle they were standing in was in fact in direct contact.</p> <p>He got out the shampoo and rinsed his face. Then, using his own soap, he rinsed his mouth. When he stood, he looked her straight in the face. "We have another thing coming," he said. He rinsed it off in her hand and held it in his palm toward her face. She could see that the soap had smeared on the upper part of her nose. She wanted it to go down but not the lower one as in sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
