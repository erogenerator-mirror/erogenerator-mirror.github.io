I was kneeling on the floor in front of him and just had to lean back on my elbows to do so. Just the look he had given me now made me shudder in remembrance.</p> <p>"Sorry," he said, shaking his head.</p> <p>"No...it's ok." I said with that same look, the same look I had given him with each blow job he'd given me for almost 4 years.</p> <p>Without looking away, he pulled up his boxers and I pulled them back up. He pulled his own pants up and then stood, looking down at me. He came over, pulled my panties out of the pocket and sat on the couch next to me. I laid my head back on his bare chest. When his lips came near mine, I kissed him, our breaths mingling in the morning sunlight, and we kissed for a few minutes. His hand began to rub up and down my back and I let it slide down to cup my buttock and squeeze it as we kissed. He ran his hand up and down my thigh, up to the top of my legs, across them. He stroked my leg gently, just brushing between my thighs, feeling the softness of my skin through the thin material of my skirt and skirt.</p> <p>I put my hand behind him and put it on his thigh, just below his cock and felt it twitch. He groaned and I bit his ear. I took his hand and put it on my breast and he did the same to me under my shirt.</p> <p>"Mmm," I said.</p> <p>He was still stroking me between my legs, but he was also rubbing my thigh and kissing me along my jaw and ear. His hand slid down to feel my bare buttock and into the cleft between. I gasped, shivered, and moved.</p> <p>"Oh, God...yes..." I whispered.</p> <p>I felt something slip and I turned so he could see. His finger touched a soft and warm spot between my legs and his fingers probed between my outer lips and onto me. I shuddered a little as he rubbed my clit while his fingers stroked and stroked my clit back and forth in my little panties. I pulled my shirt over my head and unhooked my bra so he could take both of my breasts into his hand and he began to kiss and lick and suck them until I started to moan and groan and move. Before I could say anything, he sat up.</p> <p>My eyes were closed. The bedside lamp was off so I didn't have to see anything or, I don't know, know how I'd feel lying on my back. His legs were spread out on the floor, one knee bent up to his chest, which was bent back at a 45, the other knee bent straight up out over his hip. He was on his back. I lay down on my back between his and his head was on my chest and mine was just resting on his shoulder.</p> <p>I felt his lips kiss and run over my belly and his mouth began to kiss down in front of me. I felt his breath on me and it tickled, but I wanted him so bad I could hardly breathe. I felt his tongue tracing the ridge of my pussy. I shivered with desire as it touched the tip of it. I felt one finger at my slit as he pushed in on me. My knees fell open and my thighs closed tightly around his head and I pushed against his face as he tongued me. I was being so wet down there that he slipped easily into me. I felt his tongue at the back of my pussy, as he slid it upwards under my panties, and I opened my legs a little wider to let him slide in with ease. I lifted my legs so I could press back against his face, as his tongue caressed my clit and I could feel his tongue sliding on my clit. When I came, I think he felt it, but he didn't stop until my orgasm was over. I could feel his fingers rubbing his own cock while he licked my pussy and that's what drove me crazy. I'm not sure how long we had it like that, but eventually we just fell asleep on the floor, not realizing that I'd been sleeping in the same bed as him all night. I dreamt he was there between my legs, with his head between my legs and the warm pillow over me.</p> <p>When I woke up the next day, we were in the kitchen. My mom was making bacon and eggs. I put the coffee on to brew and sat down at the table with a cup of coffee for each of us.</p> <p>"You guys have to tell me..." I started, trying to make conversation.</p> <p>I was nervous because I didn'tâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
