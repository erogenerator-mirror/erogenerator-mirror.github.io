You do really well, sir. I'm glad to see you are up to your full potential. But I can't see you doing this kind of stuff. I think you owe it to us."</p> <p>"But I just can't," said Mr. Clements. "I might have done some reading at Harvard. I'm not exactly a social climber, and I haven't dated much in the last five years. What I do know is that the University requires a degree in mathematics. To that extent, the material you've been given might also fall into that category."</p> <p>"I'm not going to do it," said Dr. Clements. "But I can't help myself. I've just been working so hard at this all along that it really doesn't help anyone, much less our family."</p> <p>"Mr. Clements, if it is anybody else you could help, then we'll try to do something about it," said Mr. Clements. "I see that this is not your idea of a good time for you to go by yourself."</p> <p>"That was one of my many reasons to come here," said Mr. Clements. "To hear what they have to say about me. To know when to call Mr. Clements back."</p> <p>He handed over the envelope he'd left on the coffee table and sat back. Then he looked at Mr. Clements. "I understand," he said. "I just hope you take me on, because I really do see a lot of things that you and your friend haven't done yet, and I'd like to be back in touch with you."</p> <p>Mr. Clements stood up again. As he walked over to the door he called to Mr. Clements again. "Are you up to going over to Mr. Clements again? I'd like to catch up with him again, and make sure we know each other better before we start again later."</p> <p>"I would!" said the older man, turning as he walked away. "I'll see you there, then!"</p> <p>As soon as he was out of sight, Mr. Clements called George, and told him what they had just agreed on. "I see you have met another man," said Dr. Clements. "What brings you back from your travels, besides work, Mr. Clements?"</p> <p>"I have to work a lot," said George. "And I haven't found the right person yet."</p> <p>"What's it like when you're back in the states?" asked Dr. Clements. "You're back in your home country."</p> <p>George was a college student, a year older than Mr. Clements. It's not something someone like him would ever hear from the city, unless of course they lived in it. And, then George had to admit, it was a lot. George was also very well off, and was very responsible of his parents' well-being. The reason Mr. Clements and Mr. Clements wanted to do for him just what Mr. Clements was going to do when he was actually back in the states was that he had the right person to go to work in the states. He'd seen it coming. He'd be back to working in the states when Mr. Clements went to work the next three days.</p> <p>"You have to go back in two weeks," said George. "If it weren't for a friend of mine, it wouldn't need to come through to see you again."</p> <p>"And what are we going to do with you?" asked Dr. Clements. "You know all the rules. You'll be going off in some other country, and it could involve a bit of work."</p> <p>George laughed. "We know about the rules, sir," he laughed. "We'd like you to be a part of the country, Mr. Clements."</p> <p>"As far as I'm concerned, I'm not taking you on, Mr. Clements," said Mr. Clements, chuckling. "That's between you and me. I promise."</p> <p>"I understand," said Mr. Clements. "I think I might be interested to know where you'd like to go next summer."</p> <p>"You know it already, George. I'm not sure it's as serious as we had thought. It doesn't have anything to do with us being back in the states, or that you'll be back in your country."</p> <p>"I think people will agree that we want you to go to work where you can do whatever you have to do," said George. "Maybe something else would work in this year's trip, though. You'll be working off your school work as well, won't you?"</p> <p>"Well, you'd be taking on more than just the school work, George," said Mr. Clements.
