You look like you could use a good laugh," she said in a friendly tone. I wasn't really into that kind of humor. I guess at some level, I was a little embarrassed.</p> <p>"There's nothing I'd like to do more," I answered with a laugh. She leaned in and kissed me. Our kisses were long, deep and wet. She tasted like jasmine; her breath was sweet and her scent was exotic. I grabbed her hips and we broke our kiss.</p> <p>"Let's go," she said, "We shouldn't be doing this."</p> <p>"Are you sure you're okay with this?" I asked, holding out my hand for her to shake instead of guiding her.</p> <p>"Yes, I'm totally sure," she said as she moved forward and hugged me. She felt so soft and warm against me and I could feel a stirring in her. For a few moments, we held each other, then she pulled back. We looked into each other's eyes.</p> <p>"I love you," she said.</p> <p>"I love you too," I replied and we hugged tighter than ever before. It felt as if we would never separate even if we really wanted this to happen. When she pulled back, I could see that the emotion we were experiencing was real.</p> <p>"Wow," I said, "I love you."</p> <p>"I love you," she affirmed, "But I think there is something I want to do. After, when we go grocery shopping?"</p> <p>"It's okay. I want to try a new toy," I answered with a laugh.</p> <p>"Ok," she said, "Maybe I should shower, get dressed and go to bed." There was a look of genuine lust in her eyes, but she knew she couldn't go through with this, not without making it something that she couldn't forget. She said, "It's okay with me, too. I know I want to, too. I've been thinking about it in the past, so I know what I want to do now."</p> <p>"We should definitely go too," I said as I stood and went into the bathroom. She followed and I was still naked when she washed her face and body. She left my cum on her skin. It was warm, but not too hot. I washed my cock and turned her back over, then we both got on and washed each other. She washed my chest and abdomen before washing my cock. "God, what a rush," I thought as she started stroking my rock-hard member, and it felt like she was massaging a hand-sized diamond. I didn't cum, but I didn't have much experience. I could understand why someone would want to wash herself after she'd just had sex, but it felt so good. When it finally got to the main course, I had to laugh at that, and then we finished washing each other. She was rubbing the soap back and forth and I was still hard as a rock. I had been stroking and rubbing my cock all day.</p> <p>"I want you to get in some of your clothes," she said after drying herself. She was still washing her body, but my cock was twitching with desire, too. "I think you're hard all right." I wasn't sure, but I think she said it to make herself feel better. We got dressed together and I told her where I was going and she said, "Don't go anywhere. We need to take care of this. I know you don't want to mess with our shopping trip, but we need to figure out how to spend it."</p> <p>"No! We're staying in our last day," I said, "We just need a change of clothes." I was determined to finish what we started.</p> <p>I got in my car, and drove off. I could feel the tears filling my eyes.</p> <p>"I can't believe how good you are," she said, with tears running down her cheeks, "I don't have words to say how I feel. I have to say I love you too."</p> <p>"I love you too. I don't know what to say," I answered as I was about to start the car and drive away. "I'm sorry but we're on our own right now," I said as I backed the car into some sort of underground garage.</p> <p>"We're not going nowhere again, are we?" she asked, as she climbed out of the car. "I can't believe you did that and then left me," she said as she hugged me.</p> <p>"No, not at all," I said as I embraced her again. It felt goodâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
