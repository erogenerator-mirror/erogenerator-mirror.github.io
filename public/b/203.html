He was about to get up, but she stopped him and started kissing his neck. "Oh don't be silly. Let's just see how things go. There will be plenty of time to let us both know how this turns out. Besides, you're a great guy. This should be fun." He smiled, not at all embarrassed, and started putting on his clothes.</p> <p>"Don't be mean. Just tell me how you like it," Jocelyn told him. She reached down and pulled her skirt up showing her white panties. "See? You like what you see..." As she was saying that she reached into her panties and pulled her hair into a ponytail, putting a wiggly, sexy smile on her face. She knew that he liked it. She liked the way a guy felt when she smiled that way.</p> <p>"Thanks. You're too good to me. How about you?"</p> <p>"I like that too. But do something for me first. Like you just did. It might be a little while before you can get to it." She reached up to her shirt and started to unsnap her bra, revealing a gorgeous chest with medium sized nipples that were poking against the wet shirt. "Oops... looks like someone's a bit overdressed."</p> <p>She sat down in his lap and started to run her fingers over his chest, smiling as she felt his reaction. "I'm almost overdressed. What should we do now?"</p> <p>"Let me show you. I can't do anything but watch you two."</p> <p>"Ok. You're a good lover. Keep going."</p> <p>Jocelyn pulled all of her clothes off and sat down in his lap, her hands running all over his muscular chest. He cupped her left breast in his hand and began gently squeezing her nipple. She leaned into him, pressing herself against him. "Mmmm... nice. I like that. I like you." She leaned her head back, her eyes closing as his left hand went to her other breast and gently squeezed it.</p> <p>"I want you..." Jocelyn leaned into him, her other nipples beginning to show. He leaned in, kissing her neck, lips moving over her shoulder to her ear.</p> <p>Jocelyn kissed him there, running her tongue along his lips and then sucking them. "Mnnph!!!" Her hips were rocking, grinding on him.</p> <p>He held her closer to him, her nipples pressing into his chest. "Ok," he said. "We'll take it slow." He ran his hands down her sides and up, squeezing them together. He slid his hand under her bra, running a finger over her left nipple. "Ooh... there is that... that's good. "</p> <p>"You're a good lover too, "she purred. She leaned into him and pressed her lips against his. He wrapped his hand around her middle and squeezed, pulling away to pull her back towards the bed. The door creaked slightly as they broke their embrace, but there was no one in the office. He kissed the inside of her ear, moving his lips to her neck and nibbling with his teeth. She held on to the covers of the bed, her fingers running through his hair. The passion they were feeling was almost too much to bare. "Mmm... I want you," she said as she rolled onto her back, taking her top off to free her breasts. He moved his lips over her right nipple, running his tongue over it. As much as he loved the feel of her, his wife wasn't as large as Jocelyn was; not fat, not fat, just right. He leaned over to her other breast, running his tongue along her nipple while he grabbed her left tit and squeezed. "Is something wrong?"</p> <p>She turned over onto her stomach and held herself up by holding on to the sheets. Her arms came up in front of her body, arms folding in front of her, fingers running through her thick wavy red hair. "No, it's nothing. I just wanted to tell you about my first time. It was weird having you in my bed. I didn't know what my first time doing anything would be like." She raised another hand up, slowly smoothed down her neck with it, her hands covering it.</p> <p>"I remember well. That day we did it. When were you guys in the shower? "</p> <p>Jocelyn's hand came up again. "That's our first time." She stood up. "We'll get to that in a minute." The door creaked again. He reached down and began to undo his pants, looking at her quizzically. "That day you were there was really weird. I guess we made you want more," she said, pulling her shirt freeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
