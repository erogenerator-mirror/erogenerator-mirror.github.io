You can just look at it and wonder what's going to happen, and if things are bad before.</p> <p>"This isn't what I want to do?" She was starting to cry again as I put the video into the player.</p> <p>"Not to bad, isn't it?" I had already gotten in position on the couch, with the camera pointed at her. She was frozen in position with her lips wide apart, with her eyes wide. I took it in. Her jaw would have dropped otherwise.</p> <p>"I don't know what you're seeing."</p> <p>"Why, it's pretty clear that you want to, I guess your husband is going to have an even more difficult time watching something like this."</p> <p>Ohmigod. I was so close to this woman and so close to the person that I had been waiting for the past few weeks. He wasn't going to get out of this that easily...I'd made a commitment to him and had a serious job to keep. He was going to get out of here, and that means one thing; it means both of us have to be naked and look at each other. She didn't move and couldn't move, just stayed as still as possible. I leaned forward and let it happen. I took a close look at her, and the look that I felt then was shock when she looked at me. She was staring straight ahead at the camera while her right hand went to her crotch and she was rubbing on her outer lips. It wasn't the first time she had done that, it was surely the first time for me. I put a hand to my forehead and tried to calm myself down.</p> <p>"I guess it's pretty clear now." I said.</p> <p>"Well...I guess it is." She said as she looked right back at the camera. A few seconds later she moved her hand and I had to take another look at her.</p> <p>She was a complete wreck.</p> <p>What did happen to me?</p> <p>The picture changed. I can feel it now.</p> <p>The photo shifted from one girl to another.</p> <p>The camera shifted from one to the other.</p> <p>The camera shifted from one to the other.</p> <p>I didn't care.</p> <p>The camera shifted from one to the other.</p> <p>The camera shifted off of one side of the frame, and the frame changed into another.</p> <p>Something moved in the frame.</p> <p>The frame changed back into another. I couldn't place where. The body language changed to something else. I don't think I could have distinguished anything except in her mouth. I was almost positive, it was something else. I saw that it was something on that body that had been moved by the camera. Maybe it was her. I couldn't tell. She was looking at the camera that I had been looking at. That's why it had changed from photo to video before, to something with her body all parts moved by the camera. That's why her skin was different, the pictures were different, and that's why she looked different, it wouldn't hurt to think about it. I didn't know the difference or the difference and I don't think it. She looked like she had been moving her legs apart. No one knew the difference, the images were blurry. I had a hard time taking the picture before, but it was clear that the person in the frame had moved her legs apart. The woman had moved her arms. She had pulled her legs open even wider. I wondered if she knew she had a woman in that picture. I wondered if she knew anything about me and that woman. If she knew that I had a woman in my hands. I saw that a second image changed to another image. I didn't know any of the things in the picture but that was all I could tell.</p> <p>I sat there in the chair, not knowing how to respond. I didn't know what I could think of or say. She was different. She looked different. If it took that long she would have made it. Was this some big mistake or was she just showing herself to me. I couldn't find the words and I knew that I would have to ask her questions. I looked at the camera before me for the thousandth time and started asking her questions about herself. I asked her about how she liked being naked, how long she been here, and who had put my life on hold. If anything I got closer to the point I didn't want to be. As I went along she started to ask about what she was doing. She told me that she couldn't decide what she liked, but howâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
