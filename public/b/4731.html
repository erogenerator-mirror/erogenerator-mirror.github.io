He moaned as another drop of pre-cum poured out, then an oozing string emerged which he spread around his balls and lower lower body with his cock and balls.</p> <p>His breathing was ragged and raspy now, as his entire body was stiff and sweaty from sweat. "Oh. oh..."</p> <p>"Geez... I... oh... I got it!" I exclaimed while my own breathing returned to normal and I continued to stroke his shaft.</p> <p>His groan filled the room and I kept pumping him hard, faster and faster.</p> <p>"Oh... Oh... Ooooh!" He suddenly cried out, arching his pelvis at me and his toes curled against the bed while his entire body went into orgasm.</p> <p>He released his load while I continued to pump him, and I held still while he shot into my hands.</p> <p>"That was... fucking... awesome." I said, still stroking in and out of him slowly while he went completely limp in my hands.</p> <p>"I can't believe we did that." He said between heavy breaths. "It's like that for us."</p> <p>"Is that so?" I teased. "Does it feel good?"</p> <p>"I don't know. It certainly is." He smiled, still catching his breath. As he caught his breath, I slid out from underneath him and stood up.</p> <p>His eyes were closed as he leaned against the side of the bed. He moved up on it, then turned to look at me. I stood up, and stepped over to him.</p> <p>"Thank you... for... me... tonight." I said quietly.</p> <p>"Yes." His lips were soft, and he looked amazing. "You're pretty hot to look at." He said with a smile. "I mean, you really are really good looking."</p> <p>"Thanks." I said with a giggle. "How about we order some food, since we didn't get enough?"</p> <p>He nodded, and stood up. We walked to the kitchen and I helped him out, holding him in my arms for a long moment just to keep our bodies close. He turned as he was opening the cabinet that held a variety of foods, and found a huge jug of hot chocolate.</p> <p>"Why don't we order some food, while we eat?" He asked. "We can take a shower afterwards and we can talk about what happened?"</p> <p>"Yeah." I answered. "I'm kind of hungry; maybe you should pick up a bag of hot chocolate, so we can get something going."</p> <p>After we got the food started, we sat at the dining room table and I went back to my work. The meal we'd already ordered came with a huge glass of orange juice, along with a couple of glasses of water.</p> <p>We made small talk, and he seemed genuinely interested in the way I was looking at him. He didn't feel awkward and didn't have a hard time hiding his interest. I thought I could see a certain confidence in him too.</p> <p>After eating, we had a shower together, and I took him to his room to lie down on the bed with him, on my back with my face buried in his hair.</p> <p>I laid there for a while, enjoying the feeling of his naked body. I loved him and I missed having him.</p> <p>"What are you watching?" He asked.</p> <p>"Bewildered." I replied without thinking of anything but him in that moment.</p> <p>"Wanna watch something?" He asked.</p> <p>"You could say that." I said. "I'm just in a mood for watching you get dressed..."</p> <p>"No, don't do that. I don't know. It kinda sounds mean, since it's you, and not me."</p> <p>I chuckled. "Trust me, you'll just have to get used to it. Besides," I said with a mischievous smile. "Maybe it's only for you and me, but maybe this will be a night you'll never forget."</p> <p>"Okay." He said, grinning. "That sounds nice."</p> <p>"Okay, wait... wait a sec... what do you do? You don't even look at me while I'm dressed."</p> <p>"Well, I don't normally get dressed. I usually come in for dinner."</p> <p>"Oh... I didn't get dressed this week and I didn't get dinner. Why?"</p> <p>"Well... because I was planning to get up early this morning." He grinned. "I haven't been sleeping really well lately." He sounded as though he was about to tell me something.</p> <p>"So this means you're not here all the time?" I said while looking up at him.</p> <p>"No. No I'm not here allâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
