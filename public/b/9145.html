I was in and over my desk again when someone walked in.</p> <p>"How's my coffee going Mrs. Jenkins? Can I take you home right away?" I was really surprised that he couldn't see that I wasn't wearing a bra this time.</p> <p>"Oh, yes! Thank you."</p> <p>"No, thank you!" He was obviously a man, or at least that's what they said for all I knew there weren't any. He pulled a shirt from his briefcase and tossed it on my chair, followed by the black silk robe he always wore around the house. It wasn't nearly as fancy as his and it felt warm to the touch, but the way I looked now reminded me of what I was going to be feeling in a little while. I got the shirt from my desk and went to the front door. He opened it with his key, turned to face me, and held out his hand for me to take. I took it without saying a word and he led me to the car.</p> <p>He got in and I started the car and off we went. My mind was clouded by the day's events, and even the feeling of the robe sliding up my body as I drove. Just as we pulled up to my house he reached for me and pulled me to him. I could taste the coffee on his breath and know that his lips were still there, but I let him kiss me. I was in a haze and when he pulled away so did he. He leaned his head to kiss me again and as our lips parted we began to kiss. My hands held him back as our mouths parted, but after what seemed like an eternity his tongue touched my lips. My pussy was wet with his kiss, and I had to fight back. If I didn't kiss him back I would come in my pants.</p> <p>Finally he broke the kiss by breaking our embrace. "Come on Mrs. Jenkins, let's go, it's getting late." And he took my hand to lead me up our steps. "Take care of yourself sweetie" he said and as soon as we were in front of his door he closed it again and locked it. As soon as we stepped out onto the street he took of his jacket and folded it on the back of a chair. He had a jacket folded in his lap. It was the same old style with three buttons down the front and there were a few buttons showing more of what I hope was mine since I had on several different things this week. We crossed over to the street then and he pulled over to the side of an alley. He opened the back passenger door and stepped out of it. As he did so I slid in the seat and he pushed the door closed. He stood up and walked around to the driver's side door and slid inside the seat.</p> <p>He got in and slid over to the driver's side and before closing the door he took his tie off and hung it on the seat. He had a pair of gray slacks on, but what he had on underneath was nothing like what I'm sure his dick or my pussy were going to think when my eyes locked on it. We drove the rest of the way down the alley, until he finally stopped and turned back to me. "Let's go home sweetie. I'm in no rush. I'm taking a little nap, I want to be up to help you with breakfast."</p> <p>"Ok baby, but take care." I nodded and pulled the car to the side of the road. As he backed out of the parking lot I leaned in and kissed him. He gave me a big sloppy kiss and as his tongues came out I felt his hand grab my ass. I could feel the bulge in his pants as we kissed on the side. He continued pulling me into the street as he got out of the car. By the time we got to his car I was pretty hot and my hand was already in my panties. He reached for my hand and helped me to my feet. He opened the driver's side door for me and let the skirt slide down to the floor. He helped me to my feet.</p> <p>Before dropping me back in the car he reached for the top button of my blouse, unbuttoned it a couple of times, and pulled it down. He reached for the tie to my belt, and I stopped him. "No please let me take it off, I want you in the car."</p> <p>He undid the belt and took the zipper in his teeth. Then, he reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out the top button. Then, he reached up and unhooked it with one hand, while still holding the blouse. With the bra held up by his finger he looked at me and asked, "You ok Mrs. Jenkins?"</p> <p>"Yes, oh yes it's really lovely.
