She'd make it happen.</p> <p>"Well, not that I'm complaining," she admitted. "But I'd hate to hear the words come out of your mouth that I didn't know you cared so much about."</p> <p>"Sorry?"</p> <p>"Yeah, you were a total ass about it," she told him, kissing him tenderly. "You didn't know you got me to love you, you just wanted me to fuck the brains out of you."</p> <p>"I wanted your pussy," he countered. "I wanted it all to myself, but I also wanted it to be perfect for me."</p> <p>"I want your cock inside me," she said. "I want you to make me feel how good you are. Please."</p> <p>"Don't start with your promises," Jason growled playfully. He kissed her again, then pressed himself to her body and moved his knees over her so he could get a firm hold of her hips. He thrust himself into her slowly, watching as their bodies came together. As they settled down on the couch, she rested her cheek on his shoulder, pulling him close. Jason was close to aching inside and couldn't bring himself to stop. He didn't know what she really saw in him, but he didn't care. He was hers now.</p> <p>"I love you," he told her.</p> <p>"I love you," she murmured. "I just wish, I'd known how much before you did."</p> <p>"Never again," he said. "Never," he told her, then thrust himself more ferociously into her.</p> <p>He could feel the softness and warmth of her under him. He could feel every twitch, every pulse. They were one. His heart could stay with her forever.</p> <p>"I love you," he told her. "I love you."</p> <p>*****</p> <p>The next morning was a flurry of emotions. Sarah had to clear her mind again, she needed a break. On Friday, she'd spent an entire day lounging around in her bed, playing with various imaginary dolls and listening to her heart beat.</p> <p>She'd never been so excited in her life.</p> <p>And to be honest, it had to do with Jason. Every other morning, her heart would thump beat, her body would shake. She had to admit that she was feeling pretty good.</p> <p>He'd never really called her 'love'. She never heard him say it. He'd had a long time to think of her. He never said you weren't good. But, she'd never thought of herself that way.</p> <p>The thought of how good it would feel if Jason made love to the first girl she had ever let out to him...</p> <p>And in all honesty, if he fucked her, she knew how good he'd make love to her.</p> <p>On Saturday, all she had to do was say 'yes'.</p> <p>And yes.</p> <p>She had a long, day.</p> <p>But it was only a few days.</p> <p>She was home in her bedroom. Her cell phone was in her drawer. It wasn't that she felt too guilty for not calling. In fact, she still didn't. Her heart was still racing.</p> <p>When she got there, she found Jason waiting for her. He'd already left work, but would be at the airport later that afternoon. He was packing his personal things into his car. He'd arranged for her to follow him at the airport and, once everything was ready for her, she could pick him up there.</p> <p>She saw what he was packing and was relieved to see his eyes gleaming as he turned his car out of the lot.</p> <p>She held out her hand and watched. He took it, held it firmly, then kissed it.</p> <p>Then he drove off.</p> <p>The drive from the airport to her car was a whirlwind. On her way to her car, she had to stop and look at his face as his hands moved over his jeans. His eyes were closed, his expression was stern. A look of pure lustful desire filled his eyes. He was waiting for her. It was all so unreal.</p> <p>It had all happened after they'd fallen asleep.</p> <p>Her heart was still racing as she pulled away from the curb. She wondered how she had felt.</p> <p>"I'm leaving," she murmured to herself as she turned and headed toward the door.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Jason was sitting in the chair, watching her as she crossed the room toward the door. He smiled when she opened the door, held out her hand. She stood next to him, her hands still holding his by the wrist.</p> <p>She put her arms around his neck as they kissed passionately. His hands traveled down over her body.
