"Do you like it?" She giggled.</p> <p>"It's so good," I said.</p> <p>"I love being on all fours," she said. "You can just bend me. But I want to feel you in my ass." My penis was growing again.</p> <p>"You have nice boobs," I said, looking up at her. "Would you let me go down on you?"</p> <p>"I'd like that very much. I'm pretty small there," she said, "but I love being on all fours. There's no reason we shouldn't touch each other. Would you like to 69 with me so we can both eat each other?" I wanted that. I'd been looking forward to a long, slow 69. I was still thinking about things to do once we had her in our bed. I decided to try a new form of domination.</p> <p>"No, I'd like it a little dirty, like having three fingers in your ass," I said. And I tried a couple of different ways. Like getting off on my fingers. And I could use them on the inside of her. Her feet, her toes, especially her heels, were a mess. "Would you like to taste me? Or would you prefer to have me suck you down there?" I wondered if I could make her cum as well as she has cum in the past.</p> <p>"I'll have to ask you," she said. "Would you like to eat me out? I've never, ever even thought about doing it back, but I'm so horny right now. Let's go to bed, right? You can give me some pleasure. But please make me cum," she pleaded.</p> <p>I couldn't deny that, and agreed. I put on a condom, as I always did. "I guess that means you want to fuck, but how?" I said. She seemed so innocent, but it didn't look like she was joking.</p> <p>"Are you kidding? That's pretty wild. I'd love it, but..." I hesitated, and said, "I'd love to try it with you and you'd let me do it. I'd love to see you in action, too." That seemed to make her feel good, and she squirmed, pressing against the arm I brought up. This would really make it a bit easier while we were home. "You've got a nice pussy," I said.</p> <p>"It's nice. It's actually pretty nice, but I don't know if it's as good as you think," she said.</p> <p>She was still straddling my lap, her feet pressed against the outside of my knees. She was sitting on my lap facing me, and the only things in my head were the question which seemed to be hovering over the situation. I thought about asking her what she wanted me to do, but decided that I couldn't do that, particularly since she was there, and I wanted to enjoy.</p> <p>"Would you really like to lick me? That would be incredible," she said.</p> <p>"Yes. Absolutely," I said.</p> <p>She leaned forward and kissed my penis with her nipples and upper lips. It was a nice kiss, and I enjoyed the texture of her mouth on me. The kisses became more passionate, and we were going very slowly. She made a mess of my penis in her mouth as well as I had done to her earlier, and it didn't take us very long before we came together in ecstasy. I couldn't quite last as long as I had hoped, but I got out of there before I lost control of my own self. She lay down on me afterwards, her nipples like little arrows on my chest. "That was so fun, wasn't it?" she asked. We didn't say another word.</p> <p>"I can't get enough," I said. She reached up and squeezed my penis tenderly between her hands. It felt like we were going to be in our own world together, sharing every thing.</p> <p>"Good," she said in a voice that said, "I can't believe how much fun you are making me feel."</p> <p>"Yes you are," I said. "Really. I think we're going to get even if we have to fuck a lot more than last time."</p> <p>"I bet," she said.</p> <p>I had no idea what to do about the subject of her interest in sex, but it didn't matter, so I talked her through something she didn't like. She was curious that I would try and make love to her in bed, but she also wanted to learn, and I was getting more than eager. It could wait. She was still breathing very deeply, but was nowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
