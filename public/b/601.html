Her breasts had been so perfectly shaped and her flat stomach was so tiny that it was impossible for me to fit one in my hands, so, I just sat on the couch. As I sat down, she spread her knees, offering me the view of her vagina. It was a gorgeous sight. I wanted desperately to feel that smooth skin, so I grabbed it and started to gently kiss its surface. After about a minute, I took her hand and brought it to my lips. I licked her finger, sucking and making her cum harder this time. As she started to slowly relax, I slid my tongue down the length of her hand and then back up to the tips of her fingers. Her hand moved slightly closer and the tip of her finger slid across the tip of mine, causing me to gasp.</p> <p>'Baby, that's so good, keep doing that,' I told her as I started to suck. She kept pulling my hand closer until my tongue hit her hand-size finger and she began to fingerfuck herself while I started to slowly tongue her hand. Slowly at first. My own orgasm approached, it was going to be difficult to remain quiet after just the two of us playing, so I had to have a little extra control over myself. I put my head at the other end of the couch and slowly began to suck on her finger, as she looked up at me. I put my head into her arm and kissed the side of her cheek, whispering that I loved her.</p> <p>'I love you too, Darling,' she said while putting her hand to my cheek. I kissed her hand on top of my head as I brought her hand to my lips and tasted her fingers. I started to suck her fingers again and then she pulled her hand away. I looked at her mouth. It was slightly swollen with arousal at tasting herself and I couldn't resist.</p> <p>'Let's go into the bedroom now,' she said. I was nervous and as she pulled me to my feet, I stood next to the couch. We were both naked in one of the warm, fluffy beds. The fabric was so soft it didn't take much motion on her part. When I sat on the pillow, she grabbed me and kissed my lips while leaning slightly over as she kissed me. She reached behind her neck with one hand and pulled herself up and sat down once more, with her back towards me.</p> <p>'Kiss me,' she whispered while continuing to kiss me. I felt so nervous. I was very familiar with the fact that we weren't going to get anywhere until we were done. I kissed her lips again and got up onto my knees. I started to kiss my way down her neck, across her collarbone, her breasts, and then down to her belly button. She took my head and put it at the other end of the bed while letting out a soft moan. I kissed the sides of the other side of her neck and then started to slowly move down her body to her stomach, just above the triangle that covered her hip.</p> <p>'Baby, please stop.'</p> <p>'Shhhh,' she said, 'Let me touch you.' She leaned forward and grabbed my cock, stroking it a couple of times through my jeans. I was already hard and she ran her fingers down and under the tip, giving it a couple of quick strokes before pulling my pants off. She started to run her finger up and down the length of my cock, making it slick. Taking my hands in hers, she led them to the edge of the bed and sat there, legs spread, waiting for me to put my penis into her waiting cunt. 'I'm still a virgin,' I said to her in a husky voice, 'and I haven't had anyone's dick in me yet.'</p> <p>'Do you like it, Honey. I'm not that sort of girl,' she asked, 'I want you in me before I cum.'</p> <p>'I want to be in you as long as I can please you,' I told her and she said yes without a second of hesitation.</p> <p>I got on my knees and placed my cock at her entrance before sliding in slowly. There was a soft knock at the door. She turned to the door, and I pushed forward again, watching her face as I worked my way into her. I paused and looked at the door. We were still in our underwear-panties and I had some difficulty putting the rest of my clothes on without looking guilty.</p> <p>'Oh, God. Yes. Fuck me as hard and as fast as you can. I want it in me forever.'</p> <p>I took her hands and raised them to her mouth as I began to fuck her more insistently. I could feel her starting to cum and I kept my pace, my cock pounding into her like a piston. I didn't think she would beâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
