She had put on a tight black leather jacket which barely contained her large breasts which could only be shown by having a long shirt open. Her blonde hair was loose and hung half covering one small side of her face and falling just below her left shoulder in a silky ponytail. There appeared to be quite the effect of a pair of black sunglasses around her face as she looked so stunning.</p> <p>That afternoon she sat beside Alex and talked about her new lover as he worked in the kitchen. She told him that she hoped it was enough and that nothing else would happen but to expect her next move. He was still a married man though and he seemed a real hunk. When he looked up and saw that she was smiling at him he could still see she had a very well built body and he was sure he had seen many women but she was quite stunning. He looked at her for a long time which was not unusual as she had made a lot of his heart beats and he wanted her badly.</p> <p>When she left that evening after his wife had gone they had not slept much at all. They had made love almost every night, sometimes twice to wake her up and make her cum but it was very short term and always stopped just before she came. One afternoon they slept in bed and her hand found his erect cock. She squeezed it firmly as they both slept and they both moaned softly when she felt him cum inside her. She knew immediately what was to follow and she had been dreaming of doing that for him. As she awoke the next morning he was already up and they went downstairs to breakfast.</p> <p>Their breakfast was just a bit of a disappointment and they didn't have much of a breakfast but they were both ready to go when Alex said, "You can go tomorrow afternoon if there is anything you want to do. I need to go for a few days so we can celebrate with a cup of coffee tomorrow."</p> <p>They had gone back to the bar together and he had found the perfect place for them to go to have a leisurely meal. She asked if there was anything else he had wanted to do with her before they had finished their work and he said "No thanks, I just did not want to go in the supermarket again today. It has gone so well between us, I feel as if every time we have been back into the pub its been a complete, if not better than. I want, I mean I have been wanting, but I cannot do anything on my own like yesterday.</p> <p>It went a bit better when he said he had also not finished the work they had been discussing. He had been looking at her closely as they had been talking and she had been trying to keep her eyes away from his as far as she could. When he had come up with one of his ideas he saw her eyes widen at the idea of having sex with another man and he took one of her hands and lifted it up so she could feel the warmth of his hand as he stroked to orgasm, he was sure she felt it too. One evening a few weeks later she was over one of his workers' houses and he had invited her to his home. There had been just one problem though.</p> <p>In the bedroom she had dressed in a white top with black silk and he had said he wanted her to go in with one of the other men tonight but she had had no problem with that. They had been standing close so one or two of the others had seen her. They had all been at a party at their house where she had been invited to dance with a couple of different guys. They had all stayed after she had gone to the pub and sat talking. One of them had asked if she had had sex with them all and she had said yes and then the guy had come up over and had whispered to her that she had wanted to go to theirs with them tonight. He was right, she had and she had said yes. One of the friends had said, "You can tell if you can, I really want you". One of the guys had said, "You must be kidding, you are a hot blonde, I would fuck you", and she had laughed and said no and then they had gone to another table and one of the guys had asked if she would come and say yes if he could take her home. They had all gone home to their flat and had not seen Alex there and after saying her goodbyes they had gone home and he had asked her to come back again and he would pick her up tomorrow morning, they had laughed and got in his car and drove away.</p> <p>She had been a bit concerned but he had asked her if she had had a good time, she had, and she thought she was going to take it even when she had known the guys had all gone home so they didn't know what was on her mind. He had been rightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
