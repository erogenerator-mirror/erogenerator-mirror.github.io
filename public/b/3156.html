He pushed the woman on his cock deep onto his shaft as his lips sought the soft flesh of her throat and began sucking. He watched his dick, still fully inside her, disappear between her lips, feeling the hot, wet passage that enveloped him. Her breasts swung heavily below his thighs, their firmness pressing firmly at his flesh. Her head thrashed side to side as her lust-fogged mind went into over-drive, the only sound they seemed to make were sounds of pleasure and pleasure only her husband could hear. She buck, grunted and grunted beneath his tongue, begging him to fuck her harder. He had always wanted to do this to her. Her tight little ass, tight vagina, and the intense pleasure of his finger fucking, combined with the pleasure of his hot manhood drilling the hole of her best lover, drove her crazy with lust and desire. Her mind reeled, her body racked with electric shocks of sensation as he ravaged her pussy with wild abandon.</p> <p>He drove her higher into the air, fucking her ass harder than ever and her screams continued to roll in her ears. His cock was buried balls deep inside the woman beneath him and she wrapped her arms and legs tighter around him, squeezing his ass as she came again. Her body arched against him as she continued coming. His mouth continued to assault her neck as he pumped into her, his breathing heavy and harsh against her soft skin. As her trembling legs became slack, he slowed their fucking, pulling both of her ass cheeks to each side of his swollen cock. He pulled his cock out from her and moved to lie on his back on the blanket beside her. She pulled his head to her as he rolled on his side, her body next to his and her head on his shoulder. They both lay quietly in silence as his fingers reached out to lightly caress her breasts through the tee, their bodies pressed together, their hips still rocking against each other's.</p> <p>"Oh, Jack!" she gasped, laying her head to his chest. Their hips moved with wild abandon and the sensation of his hard cock still inside her. The feeling of his finger against her flesh inside her made her climax last another moment longer. She pulled his head to her again and they shared one final, desperate kiss between sighs and moans of pleasure then gasped at the sound of the car that suddenly went off the track and then sped up on the freeway with the sound of the back door of the motel's main garage crashing shut and the sound of the door being locked as the woman screamed out her orgasm into the night.</p> <p>He and her lover lay together in the darkness a while longer until they too heard the car leaving the road and saw the back door open and the car's rear door close. The young stud was suddenly in the car with her, but she had dressed very carefully as she wanted to keep their intimacy as light as possible. She had dressed in a loose tank top and sweat pants that were low and thin as she had climbed into the car to sit with him in the driver's seat. He put the keys in his hand as she sat down in the seat.</p> <p>"Don't you worry about anything," she said with an air of comfort. "I know a lot more about you now than I know about you on your own."</p> <p>"Thanks," replied Jack, turning to gaze into her eyes. "I've always been kind of a geek. My grades were good. It's just I wasn't always that. Some nerds that I don't know any better than you. I guess I got the hang of it." They both smiled at the thought.</p> <p>"So your girlfriend was a virgin?" asked Jack.</p> <p>"No, she was pretty, I guess," said Jill. "But she was pretty sure about what's best for both of us but she never told me." They both laughed. "Do you think she was doing it with me? Maybe she was just pretending," said Jack.</p> <p>"She was doing it with you?" she asked him.</p> <p>"Yes, I think so. She was very nice, especially for her first time," he answered her. "She was very sweet. We just went by the other's name, you understand. Maybe a little too easy for her. Just something a woman might do to drive home from her prom. She was a big star! She told you I was pretty bad at it." "What about all this stuff in the game? Aren't you going to do it with her?"</p> <p>"I've been thinking about it that way ever since you came in the parking lot," he said to her. "I've been thinking about it the same way I do. This game with her makes me so wet I'm wet all the timeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
