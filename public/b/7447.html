I am so scared." Her voice is calm.</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"It's just..." she starts but stops and puts her hands on her stomach. "I've thought of you for too long now."</p> <p>"No, don't start."</p> <p>"It's crazy!" she thinks.</p> <p>"Well, I thought we already knew what our connection felt like." He puts his arms around her waist.</p> <p>"But your brother is here, too." She thinks for a second and pulls on his hand. "Come on, let's go. We'll get rid of all those people, so we are going to save them."</p> <p>"I won't make you." He says and they go out to the car.</p> <p>As they head out of town they stop at a bank to pick up their check.</p> <p>"The boy's parents won't approve, what about your sister?"</p> <p>They walk into a small office. As they enter he says; "You know what I'll think? Do you really think she would have gone through with it? But if she would have done it willingly, then yes, she will." Her face is serious and her eyes are sparkling. "It'll be so much easier to give her whatever she wants."</p> <p>"Of course. And if the boy wants it, he has nothing to worry about."</p> <p>"I'm sure he will." She gives him a smile.</p> <p>There's a small reception desk and they enter. He looks at her and then looks at her face. She looks away and puts his head next to hers, then she turns to him and puts a hand on his cheek.</p> <p>He puts his hands over her arms. "The boy is a wonderful thing. Now, is it okay if we take a nap? My father is busy all day, so we'd really need to nap to talk tomorrow."</p> <p>She looks at him, and then she looks away and says, "I don't want to have to go back to his side."</p> <p>"No, there's no need. We got something to do at home. Why don't we go? There's no hurry, I have some money here, something to help with expenses." She points to some stack of bills on the desk.</p> <p>"Thank you. There's no hurry, really." She smiles.</p> <p>"And for coming to pick up your check, I think you are very lucky."</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"Your family was very busy. He was in hospital for three days, before he was admitted to St. Louis. Then they talked to me about him, while he was in the hospital for four weeks, then they talked to me about him. I hope you don't mind." He kisses her on the cheek.</p> <p>"I'm very thankful."</p> <p>"Can you stay the night at his place?" "That would be nice."</p> <p>"Don't go there yet, please?"</p> <p>"I'm not going to take the risk."</p> <p>"Don't bother. I'll just go. Let me wash my face."</p> <p>"No, don't," she says looking at the floor.</p> <p>"You are very much welcome. I'll finish the washing before we go."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"I know you are a young man, and I don't intend to treat you like a kid. You don't have to do that."</p> <p>"I'm sorry. You can look after me."</p> <p>"Don't be! I'll give my money back."</p> <p>"I said no being young. You don't have to do that, it's just that my parents wouldn't approve, so what's wrong with your sister?"</p> <p>She looks at him and sees him flustered. "You seem upset."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," he says.</p> <p>"I don't feel upset, but I am sure that if I get to see her naked, I can't stop you from enjoying her."</p> <p>He looks at her and puts his hands on her hips, "Not right now! This is the first time we've been together. Let me think about it for a while. There are lots of different places to go."</p> <p>"I don't suppose we'll need to go there again?" She looks at him.</p> <p>"Let me just say it was a nice way to go after all of your problems."</p> <p>"Oh, I suppose we can do that. I haven't had any troubles, except my mother's, and now that I'm alone, I might as well do it. It's been a long time since I was with a man. I think it makes me feel special."</p> <p>"That's wonderful."</p> <p>"I'm sorry."</p> <p>She smilesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
