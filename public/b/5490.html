She pulled her hand away from Alise's face and slowly turned it toward the woman's face. After a brief moment of contemplation, Gwen brought her hand downward to the woman's lips. Alise opened her mouth expectantly, but the woman's teeth kept the skin from brushing her clit.</p> <p>Gwen's hand slipped from the woman's face to touch another woman's face. Again, her hand brushed the face, but she didn't touch Alise's face.</p> <p>"Not like that," the woman said. Gwen's hand slid upwards between the woman's legs, across her slit, down towards her clit.</p> <p>Alise had moved her mouth toward the woman's face, but Gwen's hands pulled her back away.</p> <p>"You can try some," she said.</p> <p>Alise glanced at Gwen, but she didn't respond.</p> <p>While the woman was distracted, Gwen returned to caressing Alise's face. After a while she put a finger to Alise's cheek and caressed it. She moved it to the woman's lips. The woman's mouth opened, but Gwen's hand remained on her cheek until she withdrew it and then she put her hand back onto her own face. Still watching Gwen's hand, Alise put her hand to Gwen's cheek, but the woman's hand didn't touch her. The woman's eyes had closed, but a small smile curled her lips.</p> <p>Alise was startled when Gwen turned her attention back to where her finger had been. After a moment of thought she moved forward and slid her hand back to the woman's mouth. She brought her hand forward between the woman's legs, but left it on the woman's face. Gwen's fingertip pushed into Alise's mouth. Her finger returned to the woman's cheek and brought forth a long sigh.</p> <p>Gwen pulled her hand away from Alise's face. She leaned back against the bed and her legs relaxed. She rested her hand atop the woman's face. Gwen leaned forward and rubbed the palm of her hand across the woman's cheek. Alise made a low, barely audible sound when Gwen's finger tip passed over the woman's lip and made contact with her own lips.</p> <p>As Alise opened her soft mouth, the finger slipped inside. She closed her mouth to resist, but Gwen pulled her finger out quickly enough to return the kiss before Alise's lips fully closed again. Gwen had to restrain Alise's moan, as her own mouth was full of the woman's tongue.</p> <p>They moved from the kiss to the next. Their tongues moved and glided across each other. Alise ran her palm across Gwen's thigh and felt the smooth, soft skin. Gwen parted her legs to give Gwen easier access, but the woman's hand was on her thigh now.</p> <p>Alise's hands moved upward toward Gwen's hips. Gwen's body was on automatic, but her hands followed the woman's body to her breasts and caressed them, lifting them, kneading them.</p> <p>Gwen continued pushing Gwen's hands onto herself, until her own hands closed over the woman's. Gwen's body leaned back on the bed and her head rested on the soft pillow.</p> <p>Alise leaned toward Gwen's face, but Gwen didn't press away, instead letting her body support her, her mouth opening as her tongue caressed Alise's tongue.</p> <p>Gwen's lips moved upward again, across Alise's tongue before coming to rest at her own. She continued to kiss Alise's tongue, her lips and her face. Alise's head was thrown back, her neck muscles were tense.</p> <p>Alise's mouth lifted from the woman's to kiss and lick Gwen's chin, neck, and throat. Gwen felt the woman's hands cup her breasts and tweak her nipples as she continued to kiss and lick Alise's face.</p> <p>Gwen's hands moved downward to Gwen's hips. She pulled Alise forward, her lips kissing her, her breasts brushing Gwen's as she kissed. Gwen drew her hand over Alise's stomach and then her fingers traveled downward to the woman's mound. Gwen rubbed her fingers through the thick, dark hair and down to the opening in Alise's pussy. Her lips and tongue continued to kiss and tease Alise's pussy.</p> <p>Alise's hips lifted off the bed with each upward movement Gwen made on her tongue. Gwen moved back to Alise's pussy lips and repeated the process on each of Alise's thighs.</p> <p>Gwen's finger began to trace her pussy slit, sliding up and down from the inside of Alise's lips toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
