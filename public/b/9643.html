"There really isn't any other explanation I can give you."</p> <p>I had just walked out of bathroom door when she was just standing up. Her long brown locks were still dripping water from a full mouth. She was still on the edge of the hot tub; a wet patch appeared across her front. A long-forgotten look in her rear view mirror told me how her tight pink panties covered the area she had obviously shaved bare, the red thong obviously visible as it hugged her pussy tightly. "Wow..." I said, trying to focus on my own reflection.</p> <p>With my eyes focused upon hers, I could see her breathing more rapidly. I could tell that she was excited, so I figured she was about to orgasm. I reached out and brushed her nipples and lightly cupped her ass. I felt her body respond in response. She was so wet; it was dripping down to the floor.</p> <p>"Wow, wow..." I continued. I had to be aware of how wet I had made her. I let my fingers slid lightly up one thigh and then the other. I slid them over her clit and found it protruding out and pointing toward me. I slid my fingers over her lips as her legs moved into the water. She immediately moaned and gripped my hand even harder.</p> <p>"Oh...oh...gods!" she moaned as her body suddenly shook uncontrollably as she climaxed in a way that took me by surprise. Her legs clamped around my face, pulling it closer to her vagina as she had done the first time. Now she was squeezing my head so hard that I thought she would rip me open; it felt like her legs were trying to rip off my head in half. Her grip loosened, but my body remained rooted in place despite how strongly she held me in place.</p> <p>I felt my cock begin to wilt as my orgasm subsided.</p> <p>She said, "Wow."</p> <p>"So, you're ok, huh?"</p> <p>"No, I'm not ok," she replied, "I've never been so turned on in my life. If I hadn't felt like..."</p> <p>"Wet?" I asked softly.</p> <p>"Yes, I...it's been...I don't know...many months...I've never been this turned on before."</p> <p>"Me too..." I replied, still on my knees.</p> <p>Her hand slid over to my cock which had begun to soften. "You better let me finish for you," she suggested quietly, "I'm still so wet."</p> <p>"Oh, ok," I replied, as she took my hand and brought it to her bare pussy. I ran a finger down her slit, feeling the wetness which had been there but never been on my face.</p> <p>"No, let me finish," she said as she turned her body to me again, "let me finish you..."</p> <p>I leaned forward and pressed my tongue flatly to her clit. I felt her legs open immediately as I began to caress her labia which were already glistening with arousal. I ran my tongue up to the tip, savoring her taste. Then I began to run my tongue over her hard little button, and then back down to circle it around with the tip of my tongue. Her body trembled as I did this; she couldn't help but moan as if it was the first time a woman had ever touched her before.</p> <p>"Oh...please..." she begged. I just smiled as my tongue began stroking her clit. Now, I was being very good, as I kept on sucking and lightly pinching her sensitive clit with my lips. The more I stimulated her...the more her body began to shake...and when she finally exploded I felt a flood of liquid flow through her body. She collapsed back into the water. I had never done anything like that, let alone gotten to do it myself like this! I had to know...</p> <p>I sat on the edge of the hot tub, my hand still stroking my cock and dripping water on top of what felt like it was dry. What a beautiful sight, a woman, completely open, and naked in a hot tub. "You're amazing," she said softly; "You are the reason I came here...to have you..."</p> <p>I smiled as she leaned over and kissed me. Her soft lips were full and kissable, yet there was also a sweetness to her kiss, too, that Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
