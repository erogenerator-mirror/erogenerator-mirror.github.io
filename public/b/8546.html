The clock read 10:50 am and I was in the hospital waiting for the police to arrive. My hands were trembling as I sat up in bed, staring at the clock. I knew it was 2:40. I slowly turned on my shoulder, looking at the clock again. 7:30. I heard rustling and then the door opened.</p> <p></p> <p>"Did you sleep well? I had a wonderful time."</p> <p></p> <p>"I slept great. You?"</p> <p></p> <p>"Yes. Why?"</p> <p></p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p></p> <p>"I'm about to say what I had in store for all of us at the end of the night."</p> <p></p> <p>The words were coming out of my mouth faster than I was actually able to get them out. What I had said before was that my relationship with my sister in law was now complete. That I was the first to be called into her room by the police was a good way to get it out of my system, because without my lawyer on me any of the police would have been going to my head first.</p> <p>"I am going to need to call her and talk with her first to get back to the situation. As soon as she has that settled I will let you know what is required of you."</p> <p></p> <p>I was thinking on my feet and I knew that I had to get some sleep. I had a meeting tomorrow with a counselor at 10 AM and that would take a pretty long time to get ready. I needed to get some sleep. I had no idea how this was going to change my life. I had just gotten off the couch and felt myself go down into the abyss.</p> <p>I walked out of the bedroom, into the hallway and opened the door to see a beautiful young mother in hospital scrubs sitting beside her bed with her mother in tears. When she saw me she looked up and said, "I knew you would wake her up soon." Then I heard the nurse say, "I'm sorry, what did you say?" I just looked at her and shook my head yes.</p> <p>The nurse walked over to the bed, sat down beside me and said, "You were asleep while these were getting ready. Did you ever dream about it?" I just looked at her, not knowing what else to say. It was the worst thing that could happen to me. She looked at my face and said, "Of course I do." She then looked directly at my eyes and looked me in the eyes, said, "What does it feel like to be in this room? Have you ever felt anything like this?" I just nodded.</p> <p>She said, "Would like to join us, it would help you to feel more comfortable."</p> <p>She was so beautiful. She was about 5'5 with her shoulder length brown hair and her eyes were a warm blue. She had a beautiful face with large brown expressive eyes like a school girl. Her lips were like velvet and the sound of her deep beautiful voice helped relax me.</p> <p>I turned to look at the nurse, "That sounds like a great idea. Why don't you call me on my office phone? When you reach the nurse, I promise you that you can call her on my cell and I will take care of everything."</p> <p>"Don't worry about the nurse, she won't be there waiting for me until after lunch."</p> <p></p> <p>I said, "I'll call her now or after I get some rest."</p> <p></p> <p>As I was driving to my office, I was suddenly remembering the situation with my boss. He had tried very hard to calm me, but I wasn't being very kind. As we were driving home I was about to tell him, "What have I told you about being in love?" I felt like running to him and breaking his arms, but didn't.</p> <p>I did not have to. It had been a difficult day all of it. I thought to myself, "What are they going to do if I don't get some rest?" Just then I felt a hand on my leg on the inside of my thigh, it rubbed and caressed my cock which was now getting harder than I have ever felt before.</p> <p>I didn't feel like I was doing any harm. I just closed my eyes. When we got to my office she was waiting for me to come out of my office when I walked out. She sat in my chair and I sat in an overstuffed chair in the end room. I reached out to pull her head down to my chest. When I could see her face coming back up, her eyes looked beautiful and sexy in the sunshine and her lips were just a touch away from mine. She said, "I can't keep up with your kisses until youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
