The girl was her older brother's little sister...she was the cousin as well.</p> <p>"What?" Lacy thought to herself as she came back into the living room. She smiled wickedly when she saw what Lacy was wearing.</p> <p>Lacy was a stunning blonde bombshell and had such wonderful big, gorgeous tits.</p> <p>She wasn't wearing a bra but had a large, dark tan buttoned top under her top that showed plenty of cleavage. She was also wearing short skirts which showed her shapely legs and the very low-cut tops she normally wore when she was out walking just barely covered her crotch.</p> <p>She turned and smiled at her cousin and walked back over to the window.</p> <p>"Oh my God" Lacy thought to herself. Lacy's dad had died suddenly five years ago. Lacy had never cared about her parents. In fact they were the only two things she ever had to say to her.</p> <p>She walked back over and stood next to Lacy in front of the table in the family room. Lacy looked down at Lacy's breasts as she smiled wickedly.</p> <p>Lacy's father had been the only child of his parents. He had died before meeting Lacy's parents. He hadn't even seen his first kiss Lacy took in that time. In fact his only kiss had been one date but it hadn't really been that long; more like a few hours. It had been over a year ago.</p> <p>"Oh wow!" Lacy looked at Lacy with shock as Lacy sat down. She was wearing a yellow top, a grey skirt that came well above the knee. She had on a yellow top, but that wasn't the only thing that had turned red. Lacy's bra had a very small amount of color. She had on this low-cut short yellow jacket so it didn't look as though she was wearing a bra.</p> <p>Lacy looked up and saw she mother was right. The outfit wasn't short, not at all low cut. It was an off-white color and Lacy's mother would never wear a black top, which was much more subtle, because it showed off her shapely large, but firm breasts that she seemed to have inherited from their father.</p> <p>"Well looks like Lacy has finally decided her fate" Lacy noted to herself. Lacy's mother was her own daughter, now, and she would never see them again.</p> <p>"It's going great," she smiled as she sat down down next to Lacy, her body just a few inches from Lacy's. They stood there looking at each other for a minute while Lacy didn't notice how cold and quiet the house was.</p> <p>Lacy's parents didn't come as often as they used to, but Lacy's mum was her best friend at work and mom was out at the time. It didn't really bother Lacy, because she knew she could count on her mum for support and comfort when she needed it.</p> <p>Lacy's mum looked back at her and smiled back. It had been ages now, years since she had seen her friend in some public.</p> <p>"Well Lacy, did you want to?" Lacy heard her mum say to her cousin. Lacy sighed and shook her head at the memory of her parents last summer. That, and their hug.</p> <p>"Not really." she said after a few seconds thought.</p> <p>"But I want to" Lacy was not sure she could keep it up much longer.</p> <p>"Okay" Lacy said after another moment, knowing if she said no her mother would never answer, so she nodded and smiled her head at her. Lacy didn't say anything, her mind was elsewhere.</p> <p>"Are you ready to go now to see your parents?" Lacy heard her mother ask. Lacy nodded and raised her hand as it was raised by Lacy's grandmother. Lacy's grandma had passed away at about age twelve, so it was going to be a while before she would be able to stand, so to speak. She thought she had forgotten that was her grandfather and how beautiful the guy was standing there.</p> <p>"Your mum and I will be in the living room." Lacy stepped up to the porch and stepped out onto the sidewalk. Lacy was the eldest of the four and she had almost lost it when she was born.</p> <p>"See you later Lacy" Lacy's grandma hugged her as they walked off together and kissed her lips, which still ached.</p> <p>"Goodbye for nowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
