It made her feel young again, that it was right, that it was okay, that she wanted and wanted him forever. She was glad to have his big cock into her now, as they both enjoyed what felt like a real relationship.</p> <p>When Ben was over for Sunday they moved his clothes into the guest room and had him laid on the bed. He had no idea it would be so wonderful, even more for them now, but he'd have to wait. But, he could soon feel his huge cock stretching her pussy, felt her wetness run through it and it sent a delightful thrill through him. He wanted to have her forever too.</p> <p>He didn't even think to put on his pants as she had him. She moved the chair over, moved it away before Ben could move it and placed it near the window. She leaned back on the bed and held herself in anticipation of Ben. His mouth latched on to her left tit and he sucked it, gently bit gently, and released it. Her back arched and he felt her hands tug his head down. He did what he could to her other tit and she held him as he continued sucking and biting. She didn't want it, but she knew it had to.</p> <p>She felt Ben come back up and moved on the bed. He climbed in between her legs and she lay back with his face buried in her wet pussy. They were both wet and ready, they were in love. He drove his tongue into her and she tasted wonderful. She moaned, but wanted him very badly. He got off the bed and stood. She moved off the bed and stood by him. He wanted her to suck his dick and she did. She was very good at it and she seemed to enjoy it too. As they played he reached his right hand to her pussy and found it. As he rubbed it she took her lips and let him fuck her mouth slowly, then she would suck it up and then slowly run it all over her breasts.</p> <p>When she was satisfied with how well she was going she lowered her pussy so it came down just to Ben's balls. He could feel her clit, hard and big against his balls and her breasts with one hand and her pussy rubbing his balls. He loved feeling her like that. He reached over her and felt her breasts, she had large, erect nipples, he cupped her boobs and leaned over to her and kissed her.</p> <p>"You know, you're not so bad yourself," she said. "I told you the first time, don't worry." Ben just said, "I liked it."</p> <p>He couldn't believe he was kissing her, so sweet and soft and sweet. She was so responsive. He could just see and feel her. He knew she was ready, and he loved to see his long cock sliding in and out of her wet pussy. He felt her fingers stroke his balls and then she was sliding them all over them. As he held her breasts she had his shaft and slowly worked it in and out of her mouth. She loved the feel of his big cock. It reminded her of how good his mouth could feel when he sucked it in and how it tickled her when she did that. She felt her hips start to move as she moved his cock. She loved how it felt as she moved his cock in and out of her mouth. "Fuck me," she asked, "fuck me hard. I've wanted this." She moved his cock so it was right in front of her face. She needed his big cock in her mouth and so badly. He felt different in her mouth and she loved it as he slid in again and again, she wanted his cock inside her. He slid inside her mouth so easily. He kissed and sucked her nipples. They had been close, but he wanted to feel her body. Ben wanted to feel her. He put one of her legs over his face. She felt so good with him in her mouth and he kissed her all over her face. His tongue ran over her lips, then down her chin to her neck, then she felt his cock slide further into her. He was deep in her mouth, her legs pulled him onto her. He pulled away as he drove his cock deep into her. Then he moved his face back to her and their tongues danced. He felt her body react to him and she moaned into his mouth as his cock filled her pussy.</p> <p>As he drove into her he felt her body respond to his thrusts, felt her hips move against his. They were so close to each other. They were making love. Ben was on top of her now and they were in their own world together. He moved his mouth down her chest and felt her breasts, he loved the feel of them, he loved her breasts and he loved fucking her. Their tongues touched and danced together as he continuedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
