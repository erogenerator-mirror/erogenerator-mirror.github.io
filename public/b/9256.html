If you just went for it, you could lose your self-respect because you didn’t do it well. It’ll take me a little time to get over what I have been going through, but you’ll learn to make mistakes.</p> <p>He was coming. He came in and said he was here. As I opened the door and went in, he walked in. He was all smiles, too.</p> <p>“Thank you, Jim,” he said. “I know I would’ve given you all the time in the world if I had had to.”</p> <p>I just smiled and left. At that point I thought it was going to be all about a kiss. As I walked in his mouth was everywhere on me. My body was hot and sticky, but there was a certain sexy, horny feeling coming on. He had a look of ecstasy and anticipation in his eyes too. He was totally in it. His hands were all over me too. I didn’t know what to do with them. A few seconds of him feeling me down under the collar was all I could do. He had me. We fell on a couch and I made him sit on the couch. I wanted to taste him so badly but I was afraid to.</p> <p>The last thing I remember before we made love, I was in the bedroom with two completely naked men. They hadn’t cum yet, maybe, but it felt so good. I think they both had one of my breasts and I got that big t-shirt and we got a little teddy bear for both of us too. My panties were still in the night stand. I couldn’t reach the bottom of the bed since they were in the bag. The bed sheets were still soaked.</p> <p>Once they had a condom in the bedside table, they both got between me. I wrapped my legs around them and they both went deep in me. With their fingers at that tender place of pleasure, Jim started to fuck me. This time, it didn’t hurt, it felt good. I felt his hardness sliding deep up inside me and Jim starting to move faster. His cock moved in and out of my body.</p> <p>“Oh Jim,” I said. “I’m so glad you’re here”. I was all smiles too.</p> <p>“You’re right,” Jim said. “You are. So good. So good,” he said between kisses along my neck then up to my mouth. We kissed like teenagers with tongues.</p> <p>I could see his cock growing by the way he was moving in me. It looked like a large, fat dick was moving up and down along it’s shaft. I was on the cusp of a second orgasm. He was so ready for it so was I. I opened my mouth and he entered it and just started pounding me.</p> <p>His words were still echoing on in my ear. "So good, sweetheart."</p> <p>"I’m just glad I’m here with you!"</p> <p>"I’m so glad I’m here with you, too!”</p> <p>“I’m so glad I’m here with you!”</p> <p>I was moving faster and faster. Jim had a rhythm going and they were doing everything right by me and I felt like I was right in the middle of the world. My body was starting to tremble as an earthquake had hit me and that’s exactly what I was experiencing. My nipples were swollen and they were very sensitive too. If I could just lie there for a while, I could just lie there and relax and just enjoy being here with them. Jim and Jim kept getting me closer and closer, just like this.</p> <p>I felt a finger slip down to be part of me, then it was gone.</p> <p>The finger was very warm and wet as it continued probing me. I moaned my way through it. It wasn’t long before Jim and Jim had one of them in my ass and then I felt something warm and wet probing at the entrance. I had forgotten about it. Jim was now fingering my pussy without even touching me.</p> <p>“You’re so fucking beautiful.”</p> <p>“I’m so glad you think so,” I was able to say. “That finger feels good.”</p> <p>Jim had found it—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
