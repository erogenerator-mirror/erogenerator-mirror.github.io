I ask with more of a leer than I need to. She pulls out the box of condoms I gave her. The clerk hands over the packet and we go to the counter to buy them. We buy the box.</p> <p>"I have a boyfriend, too," she says, looking over some of the condoms.</p> <p>"My boyfriend's a mechanic," I say, taking a second to catch up with her. "That might just be one of the things my friends hear about." I laugh at her.</p> <p>"Can you drive if you want to talk while we're here?" I ask, gesturing to the parking area. She turns around to face me. Her hair is long and sexy and the shirt she has on suggests the weight of her bust nicely.</p> <p>"I could. I wouldn't be any fun."</p> <p>"But you're my girl, dear, and I know you want to talk. Please don't come in here with me tonight." She looks at me with her beautiful brown eyes and sees how attractive I am. "My friend is not going with me this weekend, that's why I'm staying the weekend."</p> <p>I can't help but laugh. "Well, okay." She looks at her watch, smiles and waves. "I'm sorry, I thought you'd want me to do the driving."</p> <p>"No, you stay here. It's a lovely night." She hands me the keys.</p> <p>"You have a lovely car, too." My eyes wander over her body from head to toe. I love my girlfriends so much that they make me feel as if I am the center of attention, but my girlfriend had gotten so flustered that she had gone off to pick her car and I had insisted she drive alone. So far, no other car had been a top priority to me. It felt as though I could not take off.</p> <p>We got out of the car and walked to the front door. "Well, I guess we got settled then, thanks." She opens the door and steps inside.</p> <p>"The more the merrier, huh?" I chuckle, turning and kissing her neck while I slide the door open to greet her.</p> <p>We go into the living room, sitting down to a great dinner and talking about our life in California. We do some wine and relax a bit. "Why did you decide to come today?" I finally ask, setting down some wine for myself and her for myself. The sun has not yet lit up the window. She is naked underneath the shirt I have on underneath my pants. "I really don't want to leave my boyfriend." I hold her up while we talk.</p> <p>"I don't care," she says, kissing me and caressing my hair. "I just want you to be happy with your relationship, whatever that means. I don't want to leave you behind for anything, but I'm sure you'll want me to stay," she says with a mischievous look in her eye.</p> <p>"That's the good news, dear," I say. "The bad news is, we've only been together for two weeks and we're hardly a couple. Don't you wish something would happen between us?"</p> <p>"Well, I'm still a virgin and I'd be too embarrassed if you kept me." She giggles. "Besides, I love you, too."</p> <p>"I love you," I say, kissing her lips. "And I know you love me, too."</p> <p>"I do love you, too." She holds my hand. "I'm going to sleep with you tonight. We'll see."</p> <p>"I love you, too. But don't you have to go home until late Monday?" I ask.</p> <p>"I don't want to," she says, pulling away from me. She slides off the couch and goes to the bedroom. "Oh, I can do that, too. I'm gonna run to the mall, buy something, and then I'm going to stay here tonight.</p> <p>I can't help but laugh. "Maybe we could talk," I say with a chuckle.</p> <p>"We are going to talk, aren't we? I'll think on how to give you a few hours, maybe find out what you need and how much I need and want you to do to me again, too, later this week."</p> <p>"That sounds wonderful. Have a good long night, dear. Sleep well, and have fun!" I kiss her softly.</p> <p>I'm about to go upstairs when I feel her fingers on the side of my face. "Sh, sh," she murmurs, kissing me on the lips. "You better get to sleep, dear." She's naked under her shirt and her fingers go to my cheek. â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
