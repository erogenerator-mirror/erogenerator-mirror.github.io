I could not speak. He gently slid his index arm down between us, and I felt the skin of his hand just below the swell of my breast, through the skin. I opened my eyes and looked up, seeing him smiling down at me. He was so much better in bed that I would have done everything we had ever done together. I kissed him on the neck, nibbled his ear, all the while looking up at him as I could see him get closer to me – his eyes closed – trying to control himself.</p> <p>I felt his body grow under me, his breathing increase. His hand moved up the inside of my leg, where it could go under the short skirt I wore up, to the junction of my legs, caressing my thigh. We moved like that until his hand was on my mound. I felt the coolness of his fingers rubbing up and down my smooth pink lips, feeling myself getting hot and wet. It must have felt good to him. He pulled his hand away and pushed my skirt up, baring my ass and my dripping pussy.</p> <p>He pushed my legs up and leaned down, sucking the wet hole between my lips. I shivered at the softness of his touch, his mouth against me and his fingers inside me.</p> <p>"My baby," he said.</p> <p>I wanted to say what he wanted, but was too afraid. I didn't want to get myself in trouble – I wanted him to make me wait for it.</p> <p>He moved his mouth back, and began licking me. A moan escaped me, and his finger began working inside me. I cried out, pushing into his mouth. But he never touched me except for when he was kissing me. I was not going to be able to stand it any longer. I needed him to fuck me. This was too good, too good. I was not ready for anything so soon. He pulled my panties aside to expose my pussy lips. I saw his eyes on them, devouring them and licking them.</p> <p>He spread my legs a lot wider and began slowly licking my pussy lips. Just like me. I didn't care how he looked at my body. He licked me slowly, not just licking. He licked me inside the split of my inner lips, and then teased inside me. With his tongue, he teased that sensitive area right under my clit, and I squealed and squirmed.</p> <p>"Oh, my God," I sighed, "I'm so close. Please don't stop."</p> <p>I wanted him to lick me forever. I wanted to feel him inside me again. But the game was over and he got up, still clothed. He picked up his backpack and went through it while I got my skirt back on. We broke apart.</p> <p>"I'm going to catch some lunch while you rest up."</p> <p>"Ok." I felt sad as he walked away. That was the last thing I wanted.</p> <p>I felt sad for him. He was so kind to me, and it felt so nice. What did he do to me? How did I get him to want me? It was all so confusing and he was the one that I needed. I couldn't let him do that.</p> <p>My phone rang while I was lying on the bed. I was glad I picked it up when I felt sleepy. I opened the phone to see what was going on my phone.</p> <p>"Hello," I said before hanging up the cell and opening the rest of it to see who it was. It was him.</p> <p>"Hi, babe," he said. "I wanted to give you this before I came."</p> <p>He pulled up his shirt to cover his chest, and I looked up and down his body. He had on those tight bluejeans, with his socks still on, his belt still on.</p> <p>"What are you wearing, baby?" he asked.</p> <p>"What's your problem? You want to help?"</p> <p>"No, I'm sorry, I don't want help. I just want to touch you."</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm good with that. I have something to wear too."</p> <p>"Ok."</p> <p>I smiled, realizing that I had just said things that hadn't happened before. I felt that strange warmth in his chest, and the tension in my belly. The heat was building again, and I felt it against my thighs as he looked in my eyes.</p> <p>"You're really getting to me there."</p> <p>"I know." I was lying there under him. He was kissing me. With his mouth, his tongue. I felt his hands, moving up my body, over my breasts and ass. I was feeling him again, and he didn't care. It felt so good and it felt so naughty, to have—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
