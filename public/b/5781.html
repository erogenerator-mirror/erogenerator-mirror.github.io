I was still fully clothed as we started to make our way towards the bathroom.</p> <p>“Please do get undressed, too, honey....” I said as she stepped away from me, and stepped into the tub. “Just leave your clothes on there,” she added with the smile this time. “And let me give you a nice washing job, too...” I added, as she pulled me down into the water again, wrapping my hands around the inside of her thigh.</p> <p>“Do you realize,” she said, as her hand traced around my balls and the underside of my shaft along with her index finger, “that we’re about to get the same thing?"</p> <p>“Yes...I suppose it’s true,” I said, as her grip on my balls tightened as she took me deep into the warm water.</p> <p>“That’s right. This is what you like to see: a good, tight, cock-sucking blowjob......”</p> <p>“Oh, yes, yes....” I answered, my cock throbbing like a snake as she started to wail her words over and over.</p> <p>“This is the best,” she continued, almost pleading. “A little sucking and kissing is the best, a little sucking and kissing is the best.”</p> <p>Her words were driving me crazy. She couldn’t seem to keep quiet; the thought of her sucking my cock with her mouth filled my mind with excitement as she ran her lips and tongue over my crown for a few seconds, before sucking it back into her mouth. “Yes-suck-suck....” came the guttural moan she let out, as that familiar feeling of a penis in her mouth.</p> <p>“Mmm, yeah...” I said, as I felt my balls start to tingle in anticipation of what was sure to come. “If I keep doing that, I’d probably come in your mouth a minute from now,” I added, pushing my index finger hard against her anus to get her attention.</p> <p>“Mmm-hmmm, yeah....that’s it, do it, do it, do it!” she urged me on. “Just, don't come at the same time as I do,” she said, still moving slowly up and down on my shaft.</p> <p>“Can I....uh....have it in my pussy, please?” she asked, looking over my shoulder. “Can I....uh....uh....do your.....uh...uh....suck....you?” she asked, her eyes begging me to continue.</p> <p>“Uh-hmm—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
