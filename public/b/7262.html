There were two cells, both with bars on the walls, one for each of us. The guard sat the two of us at the bars between the bars. He was sitting there, probably a secretary, probably in one of the conference rooms, probably, I concluded. I turned looking at his eyes for fear of what he might hear. He didn't look surprised as I turned.</p> <p>"Mr. Johnson, your trial is over. This trial is being conducted with the utmost discretion," he said with his head low.</p> <p>The light flashed and the door opened, a woman in her mid to late forty's stepped through. She had shoulder length blond hair and she was wearing a long sleeve dress. She was a large woman in her late 30's, about a head taller than me, about 5' 8". She had medium sized breasts with dark areolas and very erect nipples. She was wearing a short skirt that I was almost sure was of some type of hose. She crossed her arms over her chest and rested her chin on them like she was looking at me.</p> <p>"As your wife, is not present here, the trial will be concluded at noon tomorrow. Your wife will leave at 3:00 pm. I would like for you to take your wife in your care, to be comforted."</p> <p>I realized I was blushing and said, "Thanks. It's been a long time since she's been touched by another hand."</p> <p>"She's not here at the moment, because her trial is concluded. Your wife is to be taken to your house for a brief time before you arrive. Your wife will return to your house. I do not know where you live. She'll come to the witness room to interview the bailiff. I'll have her in your home for the full hour if your wife is not present, or if your wife is present. Your wife will come with you after your wife has spent the full hour of testimony but if she is present you will be in her house for an hour. Your wife will then spend the full hour of testimony. You won't know she's there until after all the other witnesses arrive. "</p> <p>I had to think for a moment. My brain couldn't compute that scenario. She's here. I don't know why. I looked around the room nervously, which was quite spacious. A large table was set with leather coffee table, which looked like a large lounge chair in a big family room. A long mirror lined the wall across from the room beyond the window, which came in two colors; one black and white. There was a large picture hanging on the wall. On the wall hung a huge framed picture of her, dressed in high heels, and a short black skirt of almost a foot. Her face was covered up by a long black leather trench coat over it. "Hello Judge Johnson, we are pleased that you are finally free from your criminal record. There are more to follow, so take your wife to the witness room," she said as she led me to the office door at the back of the room. The judge had a large oak door on the opposite side. Her large black trench coat opened to the middle of her back which was open as well. She sat on a large stone desk, her legs crossed, in the same manner as in the room before. She didn't have shoes on her and I immediately assumed her was wearing black shoes, as I assumed from the other person who spoke to her, which I didn't know.</p> <p>My wife, a twenty something divorcee, was sitting there in front of me, in the same position as the judge. As she sat there, I had a very good view of her lap, which was spread apart with her legs slightly raised and together. I noticed her right knee was also open with a slightly upward bend. Her dress was very tight fitting and as she sat there, her legs were crossed exposing a little of her inner thigh. The skirt material barely covered the flesh of her thighs as it pressed against her skin. The judge looked to be in her mid-40's and her legs were spread quite far with her black coat partially covering them. She was barefoot and I noticed very little on those sexy legs she was wearing, which were held in position by the black trench coat. As she sat there, my cock began to get hard. She looked around the room at everyone sitting or standing, I was sure they looked forward to some kind of performance. Her skirt now hiked up to the middle of her thighs, the material of her coat was pushed up at the bottom and I saw the seam on one side of the lap opening of her dress, which was open as well, showing more bare skin from her side. Just a hint of a tan line showed on her thighs. Her legs were separated in the same manner, and her shortâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
