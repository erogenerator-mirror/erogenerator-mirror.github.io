"Let's do this."</p> <p>***</p> <p>After lunch, I went back to my desk to continue the research I was performing. I had some papers to complete to review. In the mean time, I got back into writing. I got into the subject matter of a potential solution to the world's financial problems. My thoughts were on how to solve the problem. I tried to concentrate on the problem. I tried to find a way to explain what problem to my people. After several hours of thinking about all this, I was able to come up with a solution to solve the problem. It was not a good plan because it was not well planned. I wanted to be sure people would not want to do it. It would ruin the whole research process. I wanted to tell everyone this in the scientific community of course. The next thing we would be able to do was create an experiment to solve the problem if the research led to success. And that's exactly what happened next.</p> <p>I went to the bathroom and showered. I was not in the mood to run. I wanted to save my research. At lunch, I decided that was the time to start back to my desk. Since I had made a terrible mistake with the research project, I wanted to take it easy, get a new job and try again. At a certain time, I would think about how to approach this problem. If I was successful with this endeavor, I wanted to make sure no one saw, or heard, how I had cheated on my marriage and destroyed my family. Maybe I could go back to my old life. My first thoughts were that I would keep going; at least until I found the right company. Perhaps there was a way in which I could get my marriage back.</p> <p>To make a long story short, no one else was home so I decided to just let the problem alone. I finished the thesis and went back to my desk. At lunch, my mind was on sex again. The problem came to life. I was sitting on my desk in the men's room at home, just the way I always did at lunch. One of the guys was in there. He was in his late twenties. He had a handsome face. He had a pleasant, charming manner.</p> <p>I got up and went to the restroom. I took off my clothes and took a shower. When I came out, he was gone. I had no idea what happened. I made another copy of the thesis and started working. I did not know any name. I began to plan the next time I would do research.</p> <p>The week passed quickly. The next time I was out of my office, I went to the bathroom. I was thinking about how I could solve the problem after all these months. It was too late. I was going to be gone for three days, and it took over two months of research to solve the problem. The research had to conclude early, right away.</p> <p>I decided to make the same progress when I returned home. It was a different story. My work had to go the way I wanted. I had to figure how this could be solved. And I decided on the time in order. I would try to do this first and see what I could do. My plan started when I returned to my office hours for a third time. When I returned from lunch, the first thing that happened was the doorbell rang. I ran to my room. I opened the door. I could not believe it. A distinguished looking older man stood in the doorway.</p> <p>"May I come in?"</p> <p>"Mr. McBride?"</p> <p>"Yes. I am the research lab manager."</p> <p>"Oh. OK." It was the first time my mind had changed at all during my day. I had gone so far I could be in a room with three men for several hours. My mind was in turmoil. Would I have to go through that again? Maybe I could do this first time? Then it would be my turn. I decided to try it out. "I am John, welcome."</p> <p>Mr. McBride was my supervisor. "I am Martin. Please enter."</p> <p>I followed Mr. McBride into my office. I asked for my notes and began writing. I wrote on the first few pages how the problem had to be solved. I tried everything to see in the situation how it could go through. The first solution I settled on was that he would have to make sure I didn't get too involved. I wanted to be completely discreet. I had to figure out how to do this first. I had to do it with him. It would save time and energy, too. He would have to work very hard to make sure I don't get caught, and I could get into some trouble. I went back to my desk. I thought carefully about what it meant to meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
