Suddenly my hand landed between a pair of lips; at first the scent of pussy was strong, with the soft, smooth flesh of her inner lips beginning to moisten. At last her legs parted, giving me access. I felt the wetness as they closed around me, and with my fingertips I caressed her inner lips, feeling the moistness that was there to make love with you. The warm, moist flesh of her womanhood was enveloped in one of my hands as a finger slowly slipped inside, her outer lips parting, and her inner ones parting. Her cunt was soft, so light it was almost cool.</p> <p>I slid my finger deeper inside, and started wiggling it, feeling the softness of the flesh around me as I fucked her, my finger caressing her inner lips as I withdrew it, probing the wetness as much as I could as I moved my finger inside her. Each time that finger slid out I could feel the softness of her lips, the softness of her inner lips, and then I felt the smoothness once again of her inner lips surrounding my finger.</p> <p>Her body was responding to my finger, and her legs were closing around me as I withdrew my finger. Her eyes were closed, but she spoke, "Oh you're not fucking me, you've just used your finger to bring me to orgasm."</p> <p>"But what if I do?" I replied, "What if you feel my manhood deep inside of you, deep in your cunt?"</p> <p>"I'm sure I do." she said, then she laughed at the thought. I could not resist my own laugh, it sounded delightful to me. "Well, if I do, then shall we go up to my bedroom? Do you mean you want me to suck you off like a little girl?"</p> <p>"I did not tell you to suck me. Just to feel the warmth of your mouth against mine when we make love."</p> <p>"You're fucking me. Oh yes!"</p> <p>I lay beside her, kissing her in a way I'd rarely kissed or licked her before. At the same time her hands were caressing my shoulders and my waist, and, finally, reaching down, she cupped one breast and took the nipple between her thumb and forefinger. I lay beside her, pressing myself against her. Her hand moved slowly against me and slid up my side, over my belly, feeling the muscles there, feeling the muscles beneath me.</p> <p>Releasing the nipple she said, "Oh how I wish I were sucking your hard cock. I wish I were riding you."</p> <p>"That's right!" I said, "I wish I were riding you."</p> <p>With our hands in each other's arms all night I was thinking about how I'd fuck and suck a woman like it would a man's hard cock. And how I was thinking about sucking a woman's cunt. That idea sent a chill though me that made, to me, all the more exciting for it was an idea of another woman taking my erect member.</p> <p>I moved my hand over her body, feeling the firmness of her breasts and her nipples as they hardened in my fingers. I was amazed that, not only did the breasts of any woman seem firm but the firmness of her womanhood, her softness, her warmth, the wetness of her womanhood. The thought of a woman on top, of a man in her position, made me feel a deep excitement.</p> <p>Slowly our hands made their way over each other's bodies. My lips found hers. I kissed her, sliding my tongue between her lips, exploring her mouth like I hoped my tongue might. After all, I felt, as we kissed I could feel the heat of her, her womanly fluid and her passion against mine.</p> <p>Breaking our kiss I whispered into her ear, "I'm going to give you a gift that'll make you feel like you have never felt before." My cock was throbbing in my pants as I spoke.</p> <p>"Oh yes, you, I can feel it." she replied. And I knew that she knew. But, as I suspected, I had a similar feeling about my own cock, that I had felt from the touch of a woman many times before to her. So she was willing to open herself to me as I had done to her.</p> <p>Lifting her hips off the bed I positioned her self on all fours, on the bed. Leaning down I took her in my arms and kissed her, running my tongue between her soft lips in her mouth as I had the first time.</p> <p>With her head down I began to suck on the tip of her nose, and then I began to trail kisses across it.
