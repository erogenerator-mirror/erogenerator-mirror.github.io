She was shaking, and not just because of a nervousness. She'd be late. Just the chance to cum now wasn't going to be so bad to be late. She'd also have a whole day ahead of her, and she didn't care if she was late or not.</p> <p>"No worries, no worries," he said, gently pushing her onto her knees. "Now get down on your knees and start sucking." She looked up at him, uncertainly, as she took her first real taste of manhood in years. She'd made her decision months ago, and now he was turning her body to mush with wanton desire. He smiled, nodding to himself, and reached out to the phone, calling out to her again. And again, and again, and again.</p> <p>It felt so good, feeling this man's cock against her lips. She could already feel the throbbing of her own erection, and he was getting so impatient. She tried to focus on just what she was doing, and felt him start to slide back and forth against her. The feel of it against her tongue was intoxicating, and she could feel her own blood pounding in her cock. Then he started to suck more strongly, bobbing away, and she felt him suck his own lips into her mouth, and then the feeling of his tongue against her was like nothing she had before.</p> <p>With a groan of relief, she opened her mouth and took his length, letting her lips and tongue go wild around the head, and started to slide it down her throat. He started to fuck her, rhythmically, not really fucking, and she felt her own juices leaking through the thin material of her panties to coat her thighs. He felt so good, she thought, and she pulled his cock into her mouth, pulling him back slowly, letting him slide easily in and out, back and forth.</p> <p>He pulled out, and pulled her up to her knees, guiding her to stand up and then pushing her to the carpet. He had her lie on her back on the floor, legs on her shoulders, aching for release. She was trembling, and so hot, and his fingers felt good sliding up and down her bare legs. She felt so vulnerable, her legs slightly parted as he stroked her thighs, slipping one hand behind her knee to pull her legs apart.</p> <p>And then the cock slipped in, and she cried out, arching her back and clutching at the sheets. He took his time, savouring every moment, before moving on, his hand now stroking along her inner thigh. Then he stopped, and started to enter her; he was so far inside her that her ass barely squeezed his shaft, and it took a while for a thrust to hit something inside her, but finally, she felt himself inside her. He pumped slowly, his body pressing down and he was in almost the whole of her, balls deep for a moment, then pulling out almost to the head before sinking again. She heard an ecstatic noise from him, his breath coming back to, "Yess!" she heard, breathlessly. He was fucking her now, his hands running up and down her thighs, stroking her legs, squeezing her ass, pulling her against him. She squeezed up, feeling his hard cock sliding in and out of her, the feeling of him slipping out of her, of it almost breaking her, of how full her insides were.</p> <p>She was crying out with each thrust, a sob rising in her throat. She knew that he wanted to be with her, and she started to move her hips when the urge in her loins rose further. He continued to pump, not at all slowing, and thrusting harder, in and out, taking her, loving her. When he said, "Yesss!" again, and thrust deep one more time, she screamed through multiple orgasms, crying out over and over again as he filled her, and she could feel him inside and pulsing as he came.</p> <p>He collapsed into her arms, spent, leaning against her. She felt the wetness in her panties start to trail down her thigh. "You're all right," she whispered, her chest heaving. He was still there with her, so long, but there was no sign of the night. She couldn't believe what had just happenedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
