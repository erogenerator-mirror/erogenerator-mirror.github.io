He said to her. You're beautiful. It's obvious you dress for work more often."</p> <p>"But I'm just a dress." She added. "I like dresses!"</p> <p>"But for everyday, you're just a girl." He said to her, which was true.</p> <p>He walked her to the elevator, took her hand and helped her off the elevator. Her step felt small as she walked and as he helped her out of the elevator, she felt very small herself.</p> <p>'I feel like such a girl.' She thought.</p> <p>When they got down to her office in her penthouse suite, she opened the door and saw her desk with lots of papers in front of it. "I've always liked papers!" She said, sitting in the office chair, pulling out a pile of them. She opened them up and found some books on the topic of work to learn for a while. They both looked at the books, then she picked up her laptop. She pulled out the folders and started to read them, which was not unusual on the office computer. When she was finished, the papers were a stack, some of the pages were empty, so she picked up an item and carried it to her room and put it in the computer. She closed the door behind her and put the laptop away, then she sat down on her bed and closed her eyes. When she opened them, there were several folders in front of her. She pulled out one of them, a copy of her favorite magazine from the first edition. She opened it up and found the pages it was supposed to be read from. She picked up the magazine, then she sat and read for a while.</p> <p>When she felt comfortable, she opened her laptop and put the picture that she had been looking at in the picture with her clothes on. She had changed so many clothes on the way from her normal clothes. She took off her clothes and looked at herself in the mirror, trying to see how much longer she would keep this. Then, before her eyes, she put the magazine on the nearby coffee table and looked at herself. After taking off her bra, she pulled her panties off. She still felt shy.</p> <p>"I had this look on my mind every time I looked at these pictures. It's crazy. I was never comfortable with men looking at my body, so I don't mind anymore." She told herself.</p> <p>She began to unbutton her blouse, and then she stopped, for a moment, looking at her body. She undid her bra and slid it off and tossed it aside. She unclasped her skirt and threw it. With little trouble, she unzipped her pants and pulled them down. Then she slid them down her hips, and was just now standing in front of her bed completely nude.</p> <p>'I really want to make love to him,' she thought.</p> <p>She picked up her laptop again, and she began to read the article on her page. She opened her page, she saw the page in the picture, and she had to put the magazine down. Then she opened up the page with a picture. On the page there was a guy on his knees with a big cock being shoved into another guy's mouth, while the guy in his mouth is doing an amazing job of using his tongue.</p> <p>She saw more of the pictures from the magazine and her first impression was that this guy was a very popular author. It had taken a long time to find him and the guy was an average-looking guy. He was a nice guy in several ways. He looked to be in his fifties, a little taller than most, but very athletic looking in some way. He looked really good too.</p> <p>Then, there was one photo, and her eyes went wide-eyed. She took all of it and then looked at it again, for a bit. She opened the magazine and saw some pages that she remembered, and she began to read from the article on how many pictures a guy could take that were published.</p> <p>'Those guys would look at porn all the time,' she thought. "I wish I had a camera!" She said out loud.</p> <p>She took the magazine from the page she was reading and took several more from her desk as she read it. Then she opened it, looking at the first page. "Well," she told herself, "I guess this is what I will have to leave it. Maybe tomorrow."</p> <p>It appeared to be about a half-year old girl sitting in the living room wearing very short skirts with tight skirts and very large glasses and high-heeled shoes. It was just after 4 am, so a young man with a very large penis, sitting around his bed, was just starting to read when the woman next to him got up to go to the toilet.
