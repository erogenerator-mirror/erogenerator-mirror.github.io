"Why are you here?" Her lips curled into a wry smile, so he knew she felt his pain.</p> <p>"It was my mother's wedding anniversary. She's invited my step daughter for the evening, and I thought I should ask her for a favor. Can you be here when I get off work, please?" she asked him. Her voice had grown a bit soft, and her smile had grown, as she knew it showed her worry and excitement.</p> <p>Bryce was so relieved his jaw dropped at the possibility of spending the evening with his beautiful step daughter. He looked her up and down, noting the high cheek bones, full lips, and long blonde hair. At his age, he knew he was a lucky guy to have a daughter who loved him. He felt his breath coming in shudders, and he realized he was starting to sweat. He cleared his throat and walked to the door.</p> <p>"May I take a rain check, baby?" he asked her.</p> <p>"Sure!" she said cheerfully, and headed off to the kitchen, where she found Marie waiting there. The daughter's face paled, but she looked like she was going to cry.</p> <p>"No, no!" Marie said firmly. "Bryce's not going anywhere!"</p> <p>Bryce's eyes went wide. If she had been the best lawyer in the state, he'd have her on all his case list. Marie took a deep breath and turned back to him.</p> <p>"Okay," she said. "Let me talk to him."</p> <p>Bryce's eyes were pleading. He gave her a small nod, feeling an overwhelming desire to take Marie into his arms. "Okay, if it's what you want." He was still wary about going to bed with Marie tonight. "This was just for fun," he told her, "but if it's all that's important, it will be fine with me."</p> <p>Marie smiled and nodded. "Okay," she said. "If it makes you feel better, I would be happy to come here tonight." She looked at Bryce's face, and wondered what he thought of her.</p> <p>"But no sex. I'm so, so...curious about this," she said, looking away.</p> <p>Bryce gave her a quick look, not sure what to do about that. In the past, he'd only spent a few moments with Marie since he'd had her at the party, and then only briefly. But, in this past, he was sure she was attracted to him because he was a man, and the way she looked at him, he didn't think she could do the same. He was surprised that she could even be attracted to him!</p> <p>"You're too young to have anything to worry about," he said softly, but he couldn't help but be aware of both his daughter on the side and her friend in the other room. He didn't know if it would be a problem, but he wasn't going to let his fears distract him from watching her in her dress, so he agreed.</p> <p>"Besides," he said with a small smile, "I'm glad I asked you for an evening to get together with your father." He felt his stomach drop in fear that she would freak out at his comment, but all Marie looked up at him gave him a gentle smile as she left, not moving from the room to continue her conversation.</p> <p>Chapter 3</p> <p>The house was dark. Bryce had only had to close the blinds twice before they left for room 8. He felt that he should go but wanted to see if Marie had changed her mind. He didn't know if she would have liked it if he had tried to bring out the feelings she had. He'd seen her with other men, but what they had done to her, what they looked like, was not something he felt that she approved of. He knew she'd love it if he had shown up and found out what sex was for, and he would love to hear about it, as long as it wasn't being all about him.</p> <p>Bryce was relieved when Marie did not ask where he was going, instead he took a look at her. It was still dark, but the light reflected off her hair, and her brown eyes were still closed. She appeared to have her eyes closed, but he could make out her upper upper lip and a stray curl under her eye. It was as if she didn't have the heart to turn away from him.</p> <p>There was something else she wasn't letting on though. He frowned and slowly walked toward her, almost hypnotized by her beauty. She gave a small smile and seemed to be considering whether to say something or not. He found a comfortable spot by the door, which he had made in an old style couch. He sat down and waited for her to do soâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
