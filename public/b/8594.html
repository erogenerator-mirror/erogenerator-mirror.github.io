Do it again you horny bastard. Don't make me go to the police or any of the other ones."</p> <p>I turned around, grabbed her shoulders and kissed her. When we had to break apart she said,"I've been watching you and you had better not forget that. You have a good time tonight. And have some fun and I promise I'll be back to do it again. I'm not as good as you, but at least I can return the pleasure. We'll see. And then you can have some fun and you won't regret it, okay?"</p> <p>"Oh sweetheart," I said, "you don't have to do that."</p> <p>"Well, in case you wanted to stop I had enough sense to stop. Besides, that's the way it ends. And please, don't put me in a situation like that. I don't know what got into me. Well, don't worry if it ends, it can't be a bad thing. And I'll be okay. I really wouldn't say it, if you didn't want to see me again."</p> <p>"That's fair. And just a warning, but what happens if we don't go?"</p> <p>"Well, if you were still in my room then maybe I wouldn't have followed you. Then I might not have even followed you."</p> <p>"I know, but you wouldn't let me in. And there was so much more I couldn't handle."</p> <p>"I didn't think so. Besides, who knows?"</p> <p>By the end of the night was just starting to get dark on Friday.</p> <p>We met back at the house at ten forty-five for coffee. All the windows were dark, which gave us some space around the house, but it wasn't crowded, the music was loud and the sun was bright and we talked about how much we enjoyed each other and about sex. I said that I couldn't remember anything about the sex with her, or anything like that, but I couldn't give it more thought than that. It was a really good kiss, really good, even. I didn't have to wonder what I would like if I knew, what she would like and what I would go for.</p> <p>She didn't even give me a chance to ask anything else about that night as I just asked her about it. When she asked about that night, she had all the questions and asked me questions about it. I just told her to get over it and enjoy herself. She told me she hadn't been really listening and wanted to go the next weekend and was going to hang around the house, too. But we talked about how much it meant to both of us and what we liked sexually for a while. Then we had to go to bed. She started to put down the covers, which she immediately did and we started making the bed and getting into the bed. She seemed to really like it, too, and the sex was great, too. After we slept we were still making love, but it was more like making love as it became one-sided. We could take our time and enjoy each other. I liked her slow movements on top of me. She liked it when she was facing forward. She liked it when I could feel her breasts pressing into my back. She liked it when I could see her, almost as much as she could see me, even with those glasses she must have had on.</p> <p>We had an interesting relationship. That night. I said she seemed wonderful. She didn't say she did, but if she was going to say it it was important so that I had an opportunity to tell it to her. At one point, we were spooning and she said, "If you like, I could tell it's been an interesting evening."</p> <p>I replied, "Oh, you want to do it again? Is that what you really want anyway?"</p> <p>She just smiled and said, "Just be very careful. I'm a shy, inexperienced young woman."</p> <p>But we really had made love in her bed, too and, yes, it had been fun, too. Then it ended. We woke up early on Thursday morning (and we had sex!) again. That night we had a very good talk about some of the things I had done with her and her and all my experiences with her sexual experiences during our relationship.</p> <p>That night I told her it was really hard to be honest and she said, "Well, don't be. I'm sure I'm an attractive young woman. I'm not your type any more." She got up and left when I said, "I'm glad we met after all. It really was nice getting to know you. But we'll have to do that any time we can. Maybe you will call if you ever decide you'd like to do all my things again. Okay, I'll call you."
