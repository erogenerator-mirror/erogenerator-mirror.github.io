He could feel the heat rise in him as he slid into her with all he had. He groaned as he felt her tight pussy squeeze him tightly. He leaned down, pulling her down with him as he moved to the music of the drum and bass beat she danced in. He felt her nipples slide into his chest, pinched by her hands, and he could feel them move against him.</p> <p>Her body melted against him, her legs opening further, she leaned his head down and brushed his cheek with her hand. "Not yet," she whispered. She continued to move against him even as his cock jerked against her again. He grabbed her ass and rolled them over, her nipples pressed against his chest as he began to enter her again. She could feel him thrusting in her again, as her body adjusted to the change. This time she wasn't moaning anymore, instead her movements seemed to have an urgency to them.</p> <p>His motions were a little faster now, his breath coming quicker now, his arms moving in rhythm to the music. He could feel her body move in time with him as they moved together. He could feel it against him, how they could feel each others movements against each other.</p> <p>She moved against him again, her hands moving away from his cheek, back to his shoulders. He leaned down and began to kiss her neck as he thrust in and out of her again. Her hands moved up his arms, feeling him again, her fingers feeling his flesh, sliding up along his hips to his ass, his legs, pressing against the small of his back, her hands pressing against the softness between them.</p> <p>He felt his orgasm nearing as he thrust harder, harder. She moaned, pushing herself into him. His hands reached around to rest on her ass, her breasts crushed against him, the sounds of the music filling the room as her moans reached a peak, and he could feel himself building to release. She stopped her movements, pressing herself against him. Their bodies began to become motionless against each other, moving slightly against each other.</p> <p>He could feel the passion of his orgasm rising up from his pelvis, as he began to feel the tell-tale stirrings of his release. He felt the muscles of his stomach tighten as he pulled her against him, his hips thrusting forward against hers as his cock jerked within her. He moaned as the first shot raced through his body, the intense heat of his semen shooting through him from the tips of his fingers and his toes. His whole body tensed, his muscles contracting, as he filled her with his seed. She felt it and pressed her lips against his neck for a fleeting moment. This was followed by her breath, as he had done to her earlier, as he pulled out of her, his legs falling to the side of her.</p> <p>He collapsed on the bed, feeling her body against him. His heart still racing, he felt her breath against his ear as her arms moved up his body. "Are you sure you're ok?" she whispered. Her voice seemed to be barely audible, as she touched his cheek.</p> <p>"Yes, yes, I'm fine," he breathed, as he moved over to lie beside her. He slid his hand down to her waist and ran his hand along its soft curves. He held her close against him, feeling her naked flesh against him. He was not sure what to do, but he didn't dare move any further than that. Her arms wrapped around him, as they lay there, enjoying the feel of each other against each other.</p> <p>Eventually the feeling of their bodies moving, their bodies pressed together started to subside. She felt him move over to the side of the bed as he reached for a bottle of wine. Her fingers traced along his neck to his chest as he bent down to kiss her lips softly.</p> <p>"Mmm, you taste good," he said as he pulled away, smiling and pulling her into his arms once more. He felt her head fall back into his chest as he pressed her against his leg. Looking in her eyes, he ran his hand along the swell of her breast, feeling her nipples begin to harden and press against him. He could feel the warmth of her lips pressed against his cheek.</p> <p>"This is our last time, right?" she asked, "And this is your last chance to stay," she breathed in his ear as her hand reached between their bodies. He felt her fingertips touch his cock and start to move to his thigh. He could not get enough of her touch, his excitement rising. The heat between them was mounting now, his excitement growing. He could feel her lips kissing his chest as her hands worked their way up to his ass. He could feel her nails digging into his skin, as her fingers played across his crack, as she drew one firmly against his holeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
