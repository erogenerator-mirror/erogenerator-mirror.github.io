I didn't want to leave him with his own guilt all over again, but I had to get him. I reached in the closet and pulled out my clothes. I turned from the closet and headed back into the bed room. I picked up some clothes and tossed them on the bed. I grabbed my shoes and jeans and headed to the front door. At the door, I unlocked the door and stepped out. I headed across the house and grabbed the phone. I dialed a number and saw that it was an unknown number. I hung up the phone and looked toward the front door. It was a woman's voice... a woman who called to the living room of the house, "Hey Bill, just wanted to let you know. You're coming to dinner tonight and that's a surprise."</p> <p>I was taken aback. The woman was very attractive. She was built like a dancer, with long brown hair, brown skin, nice breasts and a body that went back to when my mom was the assistant manager as she worked summers. Not a full figured woman like mom, but enough. I felt a slight stirring in my crotch. I decided not to push the moment and walked as fast as I could to the front door. I rang the doorbell and there he was, his eyes wide with surprise and I saw his shoulders shake. I took out a handful of flowers and set them down right in front of him. As I approached closer, his eyes got wider. I grabbed the flowers, turned around and smiled. Now I looked this guy up and down all evening. He looked almost as good as I remembered him even though he had been older. He had a small frame, with soft features and dark hair. His eyes, although a bit more brown than mom, really did get to him. The look was not ungentle as Mom's, and I could tell he was trying to look up to me.</p> <p>When he saw me approaching, he was still shaking all over and was still shaking and I was sure he was trying to figure out what to say to me. That was all it took. I leaned down and kissed him on the cheek. He almost dropped the flowers in shock. I walked forward, extended my hand and said "Hi Bill." I stood up and moved over to the large sofa facing the large windows, put my arms around him and began to kiss him. I moved my hands down and around his back and felt his body shiver under my touch. I had his shirt unbuttoned and he quickly pulled his shirt out of his jeans. I pushed him down on the sofa and started kissing his neck, slowly and very seductively. I worked down his chest until my mouth met his nipples. He started to moan when I kissed and sucked a couple of them and then moved to his other nipple. I licked them both from base to tip. I worked them together, then bit lightly on them. One of his hands was on the back of my head, pushing it firmly as I worked on his nipples. He was breathing heavily and could barely contain himself when I lifted his shirt over his head.</p> <p>I broke off our embrace and reached up to remove his glasses. He leaned back and raised his hands to pull them off. I kissed his chest and neck, then worked my way down and started nibbling his nipples again. He moaned as I worked on them and bit them with my teeth. Then I slid his shirt off his shoulders and arms and tossed it to the floor.</p> <p>I kissed my way down his chest. When I got to his waist, I unzipped his shorts and freed the hard cock that was pulsing under his shorts. I pulled them off and stared at his hard eight-inch cock. It was almost six inches long and thick as the hand of my favorite toy. It was at least seven inches long and really thick. I kissed his cock head and then slowly started licking and sucking and stroking his cock with my hand. I took both my hands and held his ass cheeks, pulling them apart and sliding his cock across my tongue.</p> <p>After a few moments of that, I slid his shorts and shorts completely off and moved up to straddle him in a 69 position. He moaned as I started to lick and suck on his balls. His cock was aching for me and I rubbed it against my pussy lips. I was wet too from the previous orgasm, so I slid it inside me with one slow inch.</p> <p>We continued like this for several minutes and Bill knew that he had to move. He pulled me up to him and kissed me deeply, then rolled on top of me. His cock was very hard and his body was hot, so I slid his cock up into me with one steady shove. After several minutes, I was moaning loudly. I looked at him and said "Fuck me harder lover."</p> <p>With that he moved quickly away and grabbed my hips with hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
