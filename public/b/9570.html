I just don't want to take any chances."</p> <p>"I know but at this point, we have the entire team naked so I'm pretty sure we can use the opportunity to get a look-see at you."</p> <p>His hands reached up and caressed her cheek. Her eyes were moist with lust, lust for cock and desire, desire to be taken by his big fat cock and taken by its power. "How do you think it feels?"</p> <p>"Oh it's so good."</p> <p>"You really like what I'm putting into you?"</p> <p>"More than I thought I would."</p> <p>"You shouldn't be so forward but I do like it." He pulled her close and kissed her. The kiss became more passionate and hot. They pulled apart and smiled.</p> <p>"Can I return the caress?"</p> <p>"Oh yes, take a look at yourself. You are a real piece of woman. I really like a woman who has curves, especially when they are as perky as this." Her hips moved slowly into position and her face, neck and chest were flushed and glistening with sweat. She brought her hands up and traced along his muscular arms.</p> <p>"My turn."</p> <p>"No don't." he grinned.</p> <p>In fact, there was no way that this was possible now. The room had gone silent except for the thumping beat of the music and the pulsing rhythm of his strokes, her moans in rhythm to his deep growls of pleasure. The whole room felt as if it had turned to a black hole and all the light in the place had been cut out by the music. Her hands began stroking his arms as if they were a magnet.</p> <p>"Oh god." And with that, she let go of his arms. A wave of emotion swept through her. Her face felt relaxed and unruffled, like she was smiling, like she was pleased and ready to be taken. She knew in his body, that he was the one and she had the chance of not having him take her, take her hard. He was the one who got to her first. She closed her eyes and opened her legs while she stroked him. She wanted him to do the same to her. She wasn't a virgin. A man hadn't really fucked her. It was her first time, she wasn't interested in getting it on. It had to be his idea. She was the one who'd fuck a man. To do it to him in this position, she was ready to be fucked now. She was his, she was his. And what better way than taking the pounding to come from one of them?</p> <p>He rolled her over, and with one big thrust, he fucked her right to the tip of his cock. Her eyes were closed as she raised her arms and wrapped them around his neck to pull him closer. He had her hips working hard.</p> <p>"Are you ready, Amy?"</p> <p>"Yes." Her voice was unsteady. "I've wanted this so bad." She felt so good being his, being owned, being fucked by him. He took his time and enjoyed himself too much. His breathing became shallow and he started to grunt. Amy watched and saw his cock moving in her, deep in her pussy, going deep in her. Her own body was jerking and trembling as he drove his huge cock into her. And she knew just how to feel a cock go deep in her, in her pussy. She was just the hottest woman on earth.</p> <p>"I'm coming." He growled, releasing her grip on her hips and moving back to lay beside her. The two of them were breathing hard, trying to catch their breaths, just like they had before she'd had his cock deep in her.</p> <p>"Can I get a turn?"</p> <p>"You better." He sat up on a large pile of rocks and grabbed her ass. "Come on, let's get dressed."</p> <p>She gave a giggle as she rolled over and got off her side of the bed. She knew better than to give him the show of the evening. She quickly ran back to the main room and locked the door.</p> <p>"Thank goodness, I could have sworn it was the last show of the night." She walked up to him and took his hand "I'm going to take a shower, will you come too?"</p> <p>"No, that'll just take me a while." She didn't wait for him as she stripped off her clothes in record speed. Her pussy was wet and tight. Her nipples poked out, pushing the lacy fabric of the bra to each side of her breasts in a display of eagerness for sex.</p> <p>He was already shedding his clothes.
