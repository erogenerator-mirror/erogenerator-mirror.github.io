I sighed. "I don't believe I could tell her anything. This is my first time, and I don't know if I can go from there."</p> <p>"Why?" I asked, my eyes pleading with him. "It sounds as if her parents will always be there, and I don't know if she will like this."</p> <p>"Well, she's pretty." He assured me. "She's older than you guys. And more mature. Maybe even more than you. I think it's just natural for girls with their bodies and hair to share what we all don't, and I don't exactly want to mess anything up between you guys."</p> <p>I took his hand and brought it up to my face, kissing some of the soft folds of my panties. "I want to do this too!" I said, and he squeezed my breast and cupped my pussy through my jeans. I could feel it swelling as his fingers lightly probed between my legs. It wasn't long before I had a small orgasm that brought my body to a stop. I quickly pulled away, my mouth watering at this point and my body shivering in spite of myself. "How do you know that?"</p> <p>"I just did." He said, moving in closer to me. "But as long as it's okay, I think I'm gonna like it." I felt his erection straining against his jeans. "And, if you're more comfortable, I'd love to see you do it to another woman. But for now, why don't you go see if your mom's still home." He said, pulling my hair and kissing me, sucking on my neck and kissing my mouth. "I think the idea of you doing it with our friends is getting to me."</p> <p>I nodded, still unsure if I could go through with it.</p> <p>We all got up as one, and I couldn't keep from looking at him. He'd always been pretty friendly with us, and was always so helpful, but the sex we'd all had was incredible and just as amazing when we weren't at the center. So much so, that when I felt his hands cup my face under the water, I wanted to come right then and right there. I felt that familiar warm rush of warmth spreading over me.</p> <p>I walked over to the sliding glass door, opened it, and took a deep breath before pulling him in by the hand. My arms wrapped around him, pulling him in, kissing him as his hands went back and forth inside my shirt. I broke the kiss and moved to undo the top button of his shirt but he stopped me.</p> <p>"Let me do that, please." I teased, not wanting to push him away. I knew he wanted me to do it, but I was a little more than a lover, and it was one thing for me to have a guy do to another woman while she watched, but to have him do it with my parents watching? He's never even told his parents it was okay to do that? He's never even said it was "awful."</p> <p>"Oh, no." He stepped away. "I think I'd like that if you did." I could feel his eyes burning into me as he took off his shirt. For a minute, it was all I could do to keep from running my fingers through his hair, pulling his face down to mine. And I felt as though we were falling in to that deep. "You're so gorgeous," I whispered between kisses. "You are so smooth and soft and full." I said.</p> <p>He kissed me again, then stepped back to me. He pulled down the straps of my nightshirt, then slid one arm from under my skirt before laying it down onto the floor. "Here," he said, taking my hand and dragging me into the shower with him. When I got in just as he said, he was still just as beautiful as I remembered. "Now, lie down, please." I complied, lying down as he had said, letting the cool water hit me only briefly. He was just as good in his bedroom, but his shower was a bit more powerful than the one we'd had on the deck, where we'd been.</p> <p>Buttons were the other thing he'd left on the floor with the rest of the clothes we'd brought in. He was wearing the same one, so I reached over and pulled it open, and he had a pair of bath towel wrapped around his waist as I had him undress. I put my hand on the one on his cock, making him gasp as I massaged it gently as he slid the towel down off of him. "Are you okay," I whispered between nibbles. "I'm just going to have to see to that."</p> <p>"Me too." He said, grinning broadly as I took the bottle and dipped it in the same warm water he'd just been soaking inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
