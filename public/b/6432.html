She imagined him pumping into her as hard as he could, his cock deep inside her. She imagined him screaming as he did her until the waves of pleasure ran through her body, and she closed her eyes.</p> <p>Slowly she pulled her lips from his, looking down at him. As she spoke she whispered: "I can't believe we just did that."</p> <p>He raised his eyebrows, then asked: "And do you want me to fuck you again?"</p> <p>She was surprised how quickly it had made her feel, how much it excited her. She took a deep breath and looked into his eyes, then took his cock in her hand and said: "I can barely believe it, it's all this over now. What made me do it, I can't tell you." "I know, I wish you hadn't came so quickly," she managed to say out loud to him.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sure you can tell. And I also want to be really good at it," he said laughing. "Let's do it again."</p> <p>She watched him as he went over to his bed, pulled down pants, and pulled on his shirt. She had a little more than enough time to say: "You can stay over there, I'll get you a beer in the kitchen."</p> <p>While he was in the kitchen, she went into the living room and sat with her back against the armchair and pulled up a blanket, then crawled under the blankets, leaving her shirt to the side of her legs on the blanket. It felt warm.</p> <p>While she was asleep, she was thinking that her fantasy was about to come to an end.</p> <p>In the morning, when she woke up, she found her dreams filled with sexual scenes. She couldn't believe she had dreamed her husband, naked, with a raging hard on, just fucking her. She had never known how a blow-job could feel so good, but the fantasy was just so vivid. She felt a little guilty as she dreamed her husband making love to her, but she couldn't help herself, and as she thought about it, something inside her snapped just once, and she realized the realizations were only going to get better from here. The next thing she knew, her pussy was on fire and she just had to have it.</p> <p>As she got out of bed and stretched and felt her body again, she heard him coming back. As she opened the door, she saw him standing with three of his friends and was in a daze. He was smiling when she walked in and said: "Good night, honey."</p> <p>She took a step back then grabbed him around his neck and said: "Thanks for a great night. I'll have to have more to drink." She kissed him and walked away.</p> <p>He saw she had closed the door and was walking back toward her. He was sure her panties were wet with his desire after she took the clothes off all the while he wasn't looking. His eyes were glued to their eyes as she walked away. As she turned, he was stunned to see she was wearing the panties that she had left in her room. She pulled them up again and they had a silky black satin sheath. It looked like a very long night shirt that had a lace trim. He noticed that at the bottom, it was so thin it seemed to wrap all down to the top of her ass crack. She had put it on to hide her butt from his view. All the other girls in the room had to come out to the kitchen to use it.</p> <p>"Oh," she said looking at him as he came closer.</p> <p>"I didn't want to disturb you," he said as he followed her to the kitchen.</p> <p>As she walked past him, she noticed that his cock was hard again and as she stood there in front of him, watching his eyes, she smiled and said to herself that it had been years since she had felt her pussy like this. She looked down at it again and then said: "You know I'm a married woman. I don't usually let a guy fuck me in the mouth." She knew that was one of his favorite things to do, and she couldn't do it in front of him. She had a hard time keeping the panties from her pussy when it was wet, but she tried.</p> <p>He stood by the sink, looking at her as she bent to put her panties on the counter. He put his hands on his hips as she stood there, watching him. "It's time for you to know me, now."</p> <p>"What are you doing?" He asked, as casually as if he had just finished a run at the jacuzzi.</p> <p>She pulled up her panties again with a soft thud, then reachedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
