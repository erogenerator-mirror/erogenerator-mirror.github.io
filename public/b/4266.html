"Maybe they'll get in," she said.</p> <p>Jasmine shook her head. "If I really do get them alone we'll see them."</p> <p>"Do you think they'll be as stupid as you are, if they start to make a fuss?" he said with his arm wrapped around her waist and a thumb pressing her bottom.</p> <p>"No," she said, "I think I can handle it."</p> <p>"Let him keep me company."</p> <p>She grinned. "Thanks, you're welcome."</p> <p>"But what about the rest of the girls?" he asked her.</p> <p>"Don't know, but you're sure that I'm safe if I'm that close to home," she answered as the other girls came bustling down the alley looking around at her, smiling.</p> <p>"Well," he drawled, his tone casual, "I'm sure that they'll be able to handle anything, right?"</p> <p>"Yes," she said.</p> <p>"Now," he continued, "lets enjoy the music and talk for a bit."</p> <p>Jasmine smiled at him, nodding to the dancefloor. She'd been on the dancefloor before, and had found that the most intoxicating was the sensual dance, and the music had made her heart race. The last time she'd been on it was on her wedding night. She wasn't really dancing, but she'd been dancing with some of the new guys, and they had been quite an evening. It had taken them forever to get her dancing partner, so she was enjoying herself. She watched him, amazed at the confidence the man exuded in his face as he made his steps, the graceful way he walked, the way he undulated his body, almost like a hypnotic hypnotist.</p> <p>She had never gone to bed with them but had found herself watching him again and once she'd turned down their offer again, Jasmine thought she had never been so horny, in her whole life. She wished they had been in the audience, in the music, it would have had something to do with the other girls. She sighed and walked over to the bar. Just for a minute, she thought as the DJ cleared the speakers of the dance floor. Just for the time she had before, she thought, I could give her a great time. She went to the bar and poured herself a scotch.</p> <p>Then, she went to her flat and sat on the couch with the music throbbing and twirling around her. She had to pause the music. She'd been on the dance floor all night, watching him with the others, and had found that dancing was a real turn-on. The idea that he was dancing with others wasn't too bad either. She laughed, she'd always done things with other women, enjoyed the idea, and always had fun with men. She felt as though she'd been married for years to David, the man she'd loved almost as long as she could remember. She had felt like a bride being made. She felt the desire in herself, felt the sense of power she felt in dancing. Jasmine had spent her own life, and had lived in a city on her own. She had a lovely flat in a block of flats being used from time to time by people who didn't care that she lived in another city. She was aware of something else, something that she wasn't looking forward to, and she did her best to be a good person. She would never be the same woman she was today.</p> <p>She started to feel slightly melancholy and drifted off, waking to find a new partner moving away from her. She got up, looked around, looked around the room, went into the bathroom and splashed some scented body wash into her palm, then turned it on, letting the water flow over her body, making it stand out and splash and trickle at her feet. She finished off her ritual, rubbing the shower sponge over her body, then stepped into the tub.</p> <p>She felt very good, she really was, in fact, really alive with it now. Her muscles were firm and hard as she felt herself come undone, the sensations washing over her. It had all been so perfect. She had never felt so sexy, so free in all her life.</p> <p>Then she felt the familiar sensation of herself getting wet, the sensations washing her everywhere, and she found she was not bothered at all. No, she felt no embarrassment at being sexy. When she felt her fingers brushing against herself, she was aware of her wetness. She reached under the water and let one finger slide across her clit so that she could feel the ridges around it. She closed her eyes and felt the sensations again, this time as an even more powerful wave of pleasure washed overâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
