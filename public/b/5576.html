I've got plenty of time, so the next time we talk..." She leaned back and lifted a leg and brought her pussy to my mouth. I parted her lips with my tongue and tasted her essence. She was very good; I began to eat her, trying to match exactly how I liked to eat another woman. She leaned back and spread her legs, her head down, as I made love to a woman for the first time. She was very responsive to my kisses and tongue, and I was surprised by the sweetness of her responses. I could see that she was also getting turned on.</p> <p>I kissed my way up on her body, her lips again, this time kissing her neck. "Your turn," she whispered, her hand caressing my face.</p> <p>She had gotten a lot of practice at sucking my cock. It was just like it had been with her.</p> <p>"I love licking pussy," she said. "I want to have a little part of your dick in my mouth. Do it again."</p> <p>And I did, and she was very vocal. I moved a finger into her wet pussy, and she let out more moaning words.</p> <p>"Your tongue is so deep in my pussy, oh yes, oh fuck I'm gonna cum.... Oh God that feels so good.... I'm cumming.... oh yes I am cumming.... oh! oh yes yes yes!"</p> <p>When she calmed down I pushed my finger to the second knuckle, the way she liked. She gasped.</p> <p>"Oh yes, you did it," she said. "I don't know how much longer I can wait. I've been wanting to do that for so long I just might let you put your mouth on me...."</p> <p>I thought about it and decided not to bother. We were just getting started. She had done this before, and it just reinforced what she'd said. I wondered if she'd want more. I was hard again.</p> <p>She reached across the bed and pulled her knees up so I could easily enter her, which excited me even more.</p> <p>I was still looking at her pussy after having eaten it for three wonderful minutes, the smell of lust and heat coming through the thin walls of her pussy. I ran my left hand up over her hip, over her right breast and to her pussy. I pulled my head back and looked at her, a look of shock, then understanding.</p> <p>"No, we're going to do it again, do it again. I've never done that before." She told me, lying back onto the bed, lifting one foot on the other side, so it came up between her legs and her thighs came up over my shoulders and then came together behind her legs.</p> <p>I was standing above her and I'd gotten my dick out and was moving closer to her. I felt like I was going to say something but my mouth was locked, and I could only mutter, "I can't."</p> <p>She was looking at me, her eyes twinkling, and then her breathing quickened as I pushed. She was very wet, maybe a little juice at the center of her cunt where my erection was going to come. We'd both got a little of that after the session that I'd started, I had to admit. I put my erection back in her and leaned down and kissed her on the mouth. "It's just not right. I don't want to hurt you. I know that. I was so concerned that maybe we were going to do it, just not right, we don't have the same things in common. That can change. You make me crazy, but I won't hurt you." She said.</p> <p>I looked at her with tears in my eyes. She took my hand and laid it to her breast and said, "Let's see what we can do to help you, then maybe we'll find out when we can go back, and find other things to be worried about. Okay?"</p> <p>"Okay," I said, kissing her again, then she drew my body down and we lay with our legs up over the side of hers, her head back, breathing hard and fast but still smiling a little. I leaned down and took her nipple in my mouth, lightly at first and then more as it tingled and then began to grow. She had her eyes closed now. I sucked on it and rolled it between my tongue and I heard it grow in my mouth. "You're so beautiful. You are so sexy, I can't believe that every time I think of you and want you."</p> <p>Her head went back on the pillow, and I could see that she was becoming a little bit of a lady.</p> <p>"Do you need a cock to go up your love button?" I asked, almost to myself.</p> <p>"Oh yes," she said, and put her hand back around my headâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
