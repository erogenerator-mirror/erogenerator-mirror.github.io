As I walked to the sink to rinse my mouth, some strange sound filled my nose followed just by the scent of a sweet scent. I didn't know what kind of person's perfume they used but the scent seemed to radiate out toward me as I washed my face and washed my tears. I didn't know what to do about the girl I was looking for but as I walked back toward her I realized that it wasn't that unpleasant; more that I hadn't noticed anyone standing right there in the store.</p> <p>I walked out of the restroom and looked inside trying to see if the manager had heard or recognized me. He didn't and I looked to see what to do about the woman's perfume. I decided to go upstairs and just go back to my room to shower and put on pants and a shirt when I got back to my room. I didn't need to try to find the restrooms to get anything for my shower since I had just come out there already so I used that time to get what I needed. I made my way out to see if my mother would be up to help me but my mom had already left for work. I just turned around to look for her and saw her standing there looking at me with a look of concern on her face.</p> <p>"Do you still want me to help you?"</p> <p>"Yeah, thanks mom and yes I'd like that," I replied.</p> <p>"Sure, I've seen you do that before but I don't care. Do you think you'll be able to reach the restroom if I help you?"</p> <p>"I'll probably be okay but thanks mom."</p> <p>"I'm sure you will, but can I make something to eat while I'm gone?"</p> <p>"Sure, but you don't have a purse or something in your car."</p> <p>She smiled at me and then told me to take my stuff out of my room and wait for her when she got back to work. I grabbed my things and got my purse then went into the bathroom to put on my clothes which were just out of the shower and towel myself dry. I turned on the water and pulled on the robe I had brought along and my face was already looking a little flushed. I opened the bathroom door to see what it was like to see two women out in a public bathroom. I didn't even need to turn the water on before we got to our room and I was shocked to see that there were two people there and one was just finishing taking a shower from the other.</p> <p>"I see the bathroom has a bathroom at it's own," commented the blonde as she stepped out of the shower and began drying her hair.</p> <p>"Yeah, right," agreed the brunette as she wrapped up her hair.</p> <p>"Did you say something about some lady washing your hair?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, she must be here too but I don't notice she's not alone though."</p> <p>The brunette turned to see me standing there with a shocked look on my face. "What are you doing here?" she asked.</p> <p>"Mom said that I'd do my hair for you and she said you wouldn't mind me doing your hair."</p> <p>"Why are you doing that?"</p> <p>"She's going to come find you when she's done."</p> <p>"Oh. Um...I'll leave it if it's okay with you," I managed to force out. "Can I help? I could help you," I requested.</p> <p>"I'm sure you could because you don't have one right now," responded the blonde.</p> <p>"Thank you," I said as I picked something off of the counter and looked at it. "I can't remember the last time I've had free time."</p> <p>"Oh well, you're right. I'll just see you in a bit then and I'll wait."</p> <p>As the blonde led me down the stairs to my room she explained to me that she had a bathroom right next door to mine next door since she got the job herself. As I closed the door behind her I walked over to her and took her hand in mine.</p> <p>"Do you mind taking my bath while I wait?" she asked.</p> <p>"Sure," I replied as I stepped inside, turned on the water then turned to her. "May I join you?" I asked as I extended my hand.</p> <p>"Sure," she stood up and wrapped me in a hug as I took her hand in mine.</p> <p>My mother always says that if you don't mind bathing with a stranger let her use the bathroom. I'm not sure if she really meant it but I knew that she meant it. As I looked at her she was only wearing a towel and for some reason I felt a little disappointed. She was the one asking me to come get herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
