She inhaled sharply as my fingers continued past her ear and down her neck and to the smooth, golden hair nestled atop her round breasts.</p> <p>A small moan escaped over my shoulder and I felt her move. She pulled a face, then she moved her mouth from my shoulder to my neck, leaving the tender skin exposed. I leaned forward and kissed her softly on the lips, moving closer still to her lips so that I could feel her own moist breath on my cheeks as we embraced. Our kiss began to build in intensity, our mouths sucking deeply, our tongues twining. Her arms slid around my neck, pulling my body to hers as our kiss intensified.</p> <p>Reaching down, I gently cupped one of her breasts in my hand, feeling her nipple stiffen in response. I slowly circled her nipple with my thumb, feeling it harden immediately under the silky fabric of her dress. We continued to kiss and touch each other passionately as we stood there just beyond our table, our foreheads touching. She had her hand on my cheek, which had fallen in water, and she kissed me fiercely.</p> <p>Her tongue slid along my cheek, then her mouth opened to take my lower lip between hers. My hands slid up the inside of her dress, over her breast and down its slope to her slim waist. The soft fabric of her dress was wet with her perspiration, clinging to her curves. I began to move my hands down the front of her body, tracing a path around to the front of her thighs where there were no panties left to uncover her body.</p> <p>"Oh, Nick, you're so smooth," I praised her, while squeezing her firm, round ass. She giggled and pulled gently on my hair then turned to face me. We looked deeply into each other's eyes for what seemed like an eternity. She slowly lowered her arms and put both hands behind her head, which she raised from the booth. She pulled her skirt up around her waist and the flimsy material peeled back into a single, beautiful strip. I could tell from the movement of her arms that she was wearing a skimpy lacy bra, but a large pair of pale flesh colored stockings attached to her sheer stockings emphasized her perfect round ass. I could see the dark shadow of her anus, nestled between her gorgeous mounds.</p> <p>I cupped her mound and ran my thumb over her little, pink button. She gasped loudly and turned her head slightly towards me, exposing her mouth. Her hand moved to the zipper that held the front of her dress in place. She slowly opened the front of the front of her dress, revealing her bare, creamy flesh. She looked incredibly sexy, and I began to breathe heavily as I stared at her smallish breasts and erect nipples.</p> <p>"Do you like my breasts?" she asked, nodding her head emphatically. I nodded my head in reply, as her hand moved to the back of my neck, running its fingers gently down my hairline.</p> <p>"Mm. They are nice," I answered her.</p> <p>With each of her words, we grew ever closer until our heads were touching. Her fingers moved behind the straps of her bra, holding the garment against her upper body; I could feel how the silky material slid over her firm, round breasts in the dim light of the restaurant. I pulled back slightly, wanting to see her body more closely as I felt the soft texture of her nipples as they puckered and hardened.</p> <p>My lips trailed down one of her cheeks, my cheek grazing lightly against her skin.</p> <p>"Mm." I heard her say. I continued to kiss her, feeling the small, sharp hairs on my lips before the warm, humid smell of her perfume.</p> <p>I slowly removed my hand and allowed her to take the opportunity to turn towards me, then I pushed her back against the table and kissed her, my fingers caressing her breasts as I pressed her back. I felt her stomach rise slightly when I kissed her while I pressed her back and continued to massage her breasts softly. Her lips were soft and sweet, and I felt the heat of her breath in my ear.</p> <p>She pulled me to her, kissing me hungrily. I felt myself grow hard inside my jeans as she pulled me towards her for a deep tongue-filled French kiss. Her hands continued to fondle my chest while she moved my head down to her breasts, where her tongue continued to explore my mouth once more. I cupped her breasts together and felt her breasts pressing into my hands.</p> <p>She moved one hand down to my pants, then to my hips and down to feel my already straining cock, which she stroked gently as we kissed.</p> <p>"Mm," she murmured as myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
