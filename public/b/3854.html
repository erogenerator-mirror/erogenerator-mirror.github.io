Then, just as lightly as she had kissed all the lights from the day before, she slowly pressed her lips on to the tip of his cock. "Mmm," she murmured, "It makes me so incredibly wet being kissed by another young man."</p> <p>It took all of his mental self-control to pull himself away from that kiss, and then to move back into her embrace.</p> <p>She kissed him again just as slowly, and again brought her lips to his, where she kissed him deeply and passionately. He felt his cock harden a touch, a growing bulge that he could feel through his pants. Not wanting to be in charge by his own feelings, he let his hands fall to her shoulders.</p> <p>"Come here, my sweetheart."</p> <p>Somewhat confused, she did as he asked, walking slowly and gracefully up the stairs of that big king-size bed he had in his bedroom. When he stopped, she was still kneeling on his bed, facing him. Taking his hand, she brought it to her mouth and began sucking his finger.</p> <p>"Please, let me go," she murmured with a little cry. He brought his hand to her face and pulled it away, letting his eyes take in her beauty. His hands followed her face to her breasts, and began kneading them.</p> <p>"Oh, oh, sweetheart," he said in a voice that sent vibrations through her body. She opened her eyes and looked at him, a question in her eyes and he said, "That's right."</p> <p>She brought her hands higher up to his face and held them there for a moment. Then with gentle hands, she brought his head back. She could see that he was hard now, her little button aching for him. "You're so gorgeous, young man," she cooed. His fingers went to her nipples, feeling how hard they were and gently pinching them. She leaned forward, taking him inside her mouth again, a little more than half way in. She felt her throat go dry with the sensation of having him in it. She wanted him to feel as much inside as she did. So, leaning toward him, they kissed once again, her mouth on his, her lips to his, and he could feel her breath through her nose, smell her scent, in the soft, breath, on his lips. He bent his head forward and slipped his lips against hers, tasting her in the kiss as well as feeling hers on his.</p> <p>When the kiss ended, he was panting against her mouth and she felt as if the moment had just blown, leaving a streak of wetness across her cheek. As soon as the kiss ended, she pushed his face down to hers.</p> <p>"Do it, my darling, do it for me."</p> <p>They kissed again, and then she began rubbing herself on him. Their bodies felt so hot, so soft, so alive, and they moaned with pleasure as they brought each other to the brink of no return. He was moaning, "Yes, yes," and she was purring softly, encouraging him to go on. She held him in her hands against her body, her breasts to press against him and feeling his cock as it began to rise in response to the soft and erotic sensations she was causing in herself. They both knew the moment was fast approaching, and so they held fast.</p> <p>He knew he didn't have much more than minutes until he was going to erupt in her mouth. He could feel that she had almost no control over this process and that she could not take him as deep as had been taken, as far as she might allow. He held her head in his hands to keep her where she was as she stroked him faster and faster. Her moans were in tune with his own, a symphony of want and desperation, of wanting to taste him and of wanting him to come in her mouth. He could feel it as well, her warm lips sliding up and down, up and down in a rhythm that they matched perfectly.</p> <p>He felt himself tighten up, the pulsations of pleasure rippling through him, his mind trying desperately to take control of himself as she moved faster, deeper, and deeper. Then he felt her mouth, her tongue working his shaft with a rhythm he would never forget. She was so wet, so slippery. The feel of her mouth and her hand so skillfully as she stroked up and down, squeezing his shaft, her fingers massaging his balls, her tongue moving in and out as they moved rapidly, the pleasure from their lovemaking and their love to one another was so intense that it left him breathâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
