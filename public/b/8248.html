If you can, you can do it without a condom!"</p> <p>"What are you doing, you bastard!"</p> <p>"Hey, it's okay to have sex in the car."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"Hey, I'm going to kiss you. And, you need to watch."</p> <p>I slowly moved my head back, and stared into your eyes. A smile played around my mouth. You smiled back as my tongue entered your mouth. I knew that was going to happen. In response, you closed your mouth and I could make out your tongue slide along my lips.</p> <p>"I want you to do everything for me?"</p> <p>"Oh yes." We were silent for a few minutes. Now that we were one, I just looked in to your eyes again. You looked as lost as I looked down at you. I started kissing you again as my hands slid under your shirt and slid under your waistband. I reached under so that I could feel the warmth of your body. As I slid my fingers under your waistband, you lifted off. I slowly moved my fingers upwards.</p> <p>"I can't believe how good your body feels," I whispered.</p> <p>"I know," you said as you opened your legs for me. I slid the straps of your bikini over your shoulders. I slid your skirt off your legs and it fell to the floor. You were wearing a bikini that just barely covered your pussy. I looked down at your naked body: your nipples were hard, I could see them through the thin material. I smiled to myself.</p> <p>I started kissing you again, my fingers lightly stroking your thighs. I looked up at you. Your eyes were closed and I could see your smile through your lips. I traced my lips up your cheek, and started toward your ear. Before I had gotten to her ear, I bit it gently.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful," I said as I moved your hand to my cock.</p> <p>"I know," you said as you kissed me.</p> <p>Your soft touch felt wonderful as I felt your fingers caressing me. Your touch felt even better than I could imagine. We moved to the floor of the hot tub, on our back, naked as the day we were born, with the hot tub water running down your body. We lay there facing each others as our legs entwined and our hips touched as our hips moved in time with the water. We kissed as we played with each other's bodies. Our hips started working together, as if they were dancing on a piano. I slid my finger under your arm and moved it around your back, as I reached around and cupped your breasts in my hands. I kneaded your tits as you moaned and sighed in ecstasy. I could feel your nipples as they harden and stand out, and I knew I wouldn't last much longer.</p> <p>I moved my lips down your neck and onto your breasts. Your breasts are so wonderful; they are always full and firm and look even better with my tongue and fingers. My tongue worked on your soft flesh as your moans escalated into screams. Your hips were thrusting against my finger on purpose, so I moved my finger up to the spot under your nipple, which had the effect of getting you to the point where you climaxed. Your cries were high-pitched and you kept on climaxing. When you climaxed, I moved up and sucked your wonderful nipple.</p> <p>"OH GOD! THAT FEELS SOO GOOOOOOOD," I heard you scream. I did everything I could to make you orgasm at least once. By the time you were finished, your hips were jerking against my hand. I pulled your breast away from your body and let it rest between us. You were panting. I laid next to you and caressed your breasts as I played with your pussy.</p> <p>"My pussy will need attention," I said as I moved my hands to your nipples. I teased them slowly and softly. In no time, you were moaning and begging me to be more of a lover than you could possibly be. I smiled as I continued to play with your beautiful tits. I kissed you as our hands rubbed and stroked. Once, I slid my arm under your body and moved it to your clit. You started climaxing instantly and I knew that it wasn't long before your body did.</p> <p>I kissed you with a smile on my face. I continued to kiss your neck as you came. When we were done, I slowly moved back. I looked at the clock and saw that it was three-thirty. We had almost five hours of the morning to go, but I knew that by then, we would be able to get going. I said, "I love the beach."</p> <p>"Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
