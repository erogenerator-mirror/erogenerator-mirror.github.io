She had already set a date. Her parents were all coming. They'd been invited. Well, sort of invited, I'd say. They'd also be seeing me.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>"So this is one of those big surprise gifts," I said as she approached me like a nervous deer, the whole time looking me up and down. I don't know why I said anything, but that kind of nervousness in a new context. We could have done this all the time. The problem was, though, I didn't even know what kind of surprise that would be.</p> <p>Oh, yeah, I knew what to expect, and that didn't bother me.</p> <p>"Thank you." She blushed, then looked me up and down. "Oh, no need to thank me. We're getting married."</p> <p>"Oh. You weren't planning on marrying me? ... Yes of course I do!" The expression on her face was as much of a surprise as I was. She was about to say that she couldn't possibly, but she had to. Then, her face went white. "I... I can't believe my mouth... What... Oh!"</p> <p>The shock of the kiss came as a shock to both of us, and I felt a little flutter just then because of it. She had wanted us to be naked together, but she'd never really expected us to. There's a special way for people to meet other people, though.</p> <p>It was a moment before any of us were able to talk about what could be construed as "doing it," as in not quite believing it outright, but, it was there. This was her moment, and it didn't matter. It was all about how it would go out for both of us.</p> <p>"It's just as wonderful to see you all together as it is to... to marry you," she said, though I knew it was probably only half-joking.</p> <p>"And to not be alone with you." That said, I had been the one who'd been out on our first date, but who'd agreed to a second -- for more than the first -- date after the second.</p> <p>"Oh. Of course," she said, then took back her hands and started to untie them. "Let me," was the only thing she said, not wanting to seem like a braying teenager. "Let me go..." she said, even though my hands had found their way to her waist and were slowly dragging through.</p> <p>We both watched her as the tension lifted from the two of us.</p> <p>"...We'll be married, after all," she said, sounding more confident now, more confident. "But for now... I feel this need..." her fingers danced through my hair, and she leaned forward and started to kiss me. I expected her to be the first to say goodbye (that might have been good to leave her with a taste of me), but her kiss was exactly what she needed to do to break through her nervousness. Her kiss seemed just enough to break the tension. It felt good, right there in the moment.</p> <p>It was a minute or half of kissing before I pulled her close and felt her arms wrap around me again. It felt right, but she kept repeating it again and again as our lips locked, her arms moving and sliding around me the whole time. It was very, very different from a kiss like that, but one I'd felt with my own hands. Her arms were soft and warm and... all of a sudden, we were pressed together, almost completely pressed together.</p> <p>I felt her hips move, to press against me now, and her arms were moving so much that I was able to hold them. One of her hands was pressing against me to my left. I held onto her to my left. Her arms moved over me to press tighter to me, to bring me even closer to her. I could feel the firmness of her breasts as her arms moved up and down my body. My mouth felt open, and she was kissing me.</p> <p>As we kissed, my hands were now feeling up her body too. Her chest felt soft and warm and smooth as I found a more sensitive area of her upper body, where skin, hair and skin and hair were all very important. I remembered her first surprise at my wanting her as only a woman could, and felt how much she wanted me as well. Maybe not as a daughter, but as her... as her... Her daughter. Or the daughter of her own father, or someone else's.</p> <p>I wanted to taste her, and soon; very soon. But we'd been planning this and I wasn't sure how far and if we could do it at all. And not just this little kiss, but all of it. I'd come to her for her a little like thisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
