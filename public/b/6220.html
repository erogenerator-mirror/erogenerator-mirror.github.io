It felt as if she were trying to suck his entire body inside. Then he felt her lips and tongue gently caressing his face. That familiar warmth felt wonderful. Then he felt her tongue exploring the soft folds of his lips.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, honey, kiss me!" Rebecca moaned. He felt her hot breath brush against his lips. The smell of her perfume, the texture of her hair, the warmth of her body ... He felt his body responding to her as if his whole mind was being drawn to her.</p> <p>The kiss continued and Rebecca slowly moved her arms so that they could embrace each other tightly. He could feel himself responding to her. He felt her hands tracing lightly over his shoulders. It felt so wonderful he thought he might even like having them at his sides.</p> <p>"Now, honey, I want you to feel everything." Rebecca said as she gently pushed on his shoulders. As she gently pushed him back she guided his lips down the column of his neck. A little farther, he thought to himself. "You're going to love this." She whispered in his ear. "You're going to love every inch of this!"</p> <p>Rebecca moved the tip of her tongue lightly across the soft curve that she was tracing along his collar. She moved it slowly until he felt her tongue slide from the center of his chin down the other side. As she did the kiss he felt her tongue slide along the underside of his cheek. The scent of her perfume hit him, making him want more.</p> <p>Rebecca kept moving down until her face was at the juncture of his thighs and he felt her fingers slowly spread the folds of his shorts open. The sight of his bulge and her gentle lips caressing his thigh seemed like a perfect moment for Rebecca. He knew he didn't have to guide his dick into her mouth to enter her. It was only that he didn't want to push her off. This moment was perfect. He wanted more, more of Rebecca.</p> <p>Rebecca's eyes never left that cock that she had just given him the incredible pleasure he had been feeling. "You are so beautiful." Rebecca whispered as she slowly bent over slightly on the floor to look into his eyes. She could see the love in his expression. "I love you, dear," was all she could say.</p> <p>"You are so wonderfully beautiful!" he said. He could feel his body responding to her. The touch, the smells, the taste, all the softness of Rebecca. "You are just so beautiful."</p> <p>"Do you want more?" Rebecca asked. "Then make love to me again."</p> <p>"Yes . . I want more." Rebecca said.</p> <p>At that point his penis was just aching for her mouth. Not wanting to wait any longer he pushed and pulled himself closer to the bed until his entire body was stretched out across Rebecca's. He felt his legs slowly slide open. He felt Rebecca's mouth and tongue as they slipped from his penis back to the tip. He felt her tongue slide along the bottom of his shaft and heard her sucking very gently. He could feel his heart pounding at the incredible feelings in his body. He could feel himself starting to throb.</p> <p>Rebecca couldn't believe that she was able to take more of him in and into her mouth. As if she had read his mind she pulled her hands away so that when he pulled back she could pull free. Slowly it seemed as if they both were enjoying the feeling of their bodies against each other.</p> <p>Rebecca moved her mouth from his penis down to his legs and began the same motion as before. Rebecca's tongue was so skilled, as if she had been doing it all her life. She sucked hard, making sure she stayed on her back. She pulled gently on his leg to bring it closer to her. Her tongue was so skilled. She slowly dragged it up his leg and over to the part that was only accessible to her.</p> <p>Rebecca used her mouth to open and swallow over and over. This always had an effect on him. He loved the sensation of her mouth on his cock. She loved to give him head, not just give him oral, but to give him pleasure and to have him come in her mouth.</p> <p>Now though she had his legs spread wide and his cock head was pressed up against her lips, she wasn't trying to pull him down. She just wanted to enjoy the feel of him inside of her as long as she could.</p> <p>"Let me kiss you again." Rebecca whispered as her tongue darted out over and around the head of his penis.
