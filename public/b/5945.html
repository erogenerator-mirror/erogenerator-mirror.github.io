The second time to learn something new about her would always be a different story.</p> <p>What a girl had, and how she was used to being treated with respect.</p> <p>What happens when a girl has a hard time getting around guys. There was that last kiss they gave me. That must have happened a few times, but I remember it was special. When someone tried to kiss me, I pulled back. There was no mistaking it was a girl trying to kiss me, so I kissed her back. Then they gave me a "kiss" and I was feeling left out. I made a conscious effort to ignore it.</p> <p>The last two kisses I gave them were on my neck when we were alone at the lake. I was feeling very good, if a little frisky. I didn't know if the three times I got to know a woman better was special, maybe it was a new experience for me. I wasn't certain. A girl, or a woman, had never kissed me before. It was always a good thing the woman had a boyfriend.</p> <p>Even though most of those moments were in the privacy of our own home, I had learned more now, and there were several women that were experienced at it. I didn't understand their reaction. Perhaps, it was a male upbringing, or it was something else. I had seen a few naked women and felt a different thrill. I don't know exactly what it was it, but I had felt like that. Now I was feeling something that was new, and I wasn't sure how to define it. But my feelings were different. They were probably not sexual feelings, just what the two of them were experiencing.</p> <p>For an old man, that would be an even older age. I don't know the age of a man, but I would guess in my late seventies I was a healthy old man.</p> <p>One of the women was young, about thirty five. She didn't seem upset by the contact with me. She didn't call me on it at all. If the "kissing" I was doing with her were the same as with most girls, then maybe her reaction wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.</p> <p>She had been watching me closely, her eyes riveted on my eyes. I was pretty sure she could tell I had felt a tinge of sexual excitement, and that I had enjoyed her company. I think she might have been feeling sexually excited too, because I think her face was flushed, with a little red blush.</p> <p>When I felt she had a desire to see more of me, the only thing for her to do was make sure her eyes could not wander from my eyes to my chest. Then her eyes would stray back to gaze on my crotch.</p> <p>Sometimes I felt she was looking at my cock. The size of it, and it must have been as big as a beer can. Her eyes never stopped roaming over my breasts, up my stomach, to my breasts, and back again. Maybe some part of her didn't realize my body was aching. I don't know exactly what that might be. But she couldn't seem to stop looking at my chest. Sometimes I wondered if the old me felt the same way. A lot of the girls at camp and in high school would have just told me it would hurt, but it just hurt.</p> <p>I wondered if she felt the same way. That wouldn't be a good thing, would it?</p> <p>I had no idea of those feelings, but one day she asked me how I had been feeling about something so personal. I didn't think it was an unspoken question, just what she felt. I felt I was in a new territory. I wasn't sure of how to answer her.</p> <p>"Do you feel bad?" She asked. "I don't mean I don't. I mean I know you aren't supposed to feel this way, but is it alright?"</p> <p>I couldn't find an answer. "Is it all right if I feel this, too?" I asked.</p> <p>She started to get up, but didn't. She got on her knees and pulled me down, so I was lying on my back next to her on one side and her on the other side being held fast. I was holding my cock in my fist, as I had just learned, but it wasn't hard and was pointing straight out. It was a big erection, and it seemed like every nerve in my body was on fire.</p> <p>My face was near hers, and she was looking up at me. It was as if we were twins, just looking at each other, not really speaking. Her hands reached up and held my head, and my lips were pressed hard against hers. It was as though we were holding lipsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
