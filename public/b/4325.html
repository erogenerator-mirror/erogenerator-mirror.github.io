"A lot."</p> <p>I turned to him. I didn't like the idea of making plans for sex with the guy, especially by just having sex with one of us. But I didn't really have a choice, so I didn't make a play for it. Maybe I could get away with doing it by a chance, if he was willing to be a gentleman. That way, all the way home, I'd be doing something I'd really enjoy.</p> <p>"All right, I won't be a minute," I said.</p> <p>I could still feel butterflies flutter as I took his face in both hands and kissed him full on the mouth, our tongues dancing together, almost like we were lovers. I had no intention of just getting into our relationship. I knew he was a great man and I was sure he felt the same way about me. He might even have been turned on, although I couldn't tell, which wouldn't change my mind about anything. But I would never know if he had any idea how turned on I was.</p> <p>"Well, have fun with your friend, okay?"</p> <p>"Okay, I guess," he answered.</p> <p>As we drove home, I could feel butterflies in my stomach, but they never really stopped; especially during the car ride home. I felt wonderful and alive and contented. I loved to think of what I was doing. I couldn't fathom why anyone would be thinking of doing that to me, especially not with the kind of commitment and commitment I was. That's why I was doing what I was doing.</p> <p>I drove him home and I kissed him on the cheeks and then I let him into the house. I stood at the curb, a little nervously as he fidgeted in his shoes, the thought of all the things I had already gone through with him finally coming to fruition. I really wanted him—or was I just imagining things? I wanted to show him how much I didn't love him, to say what I was thinking. To ask him to tell me in what he thought it would be like to be with me.</p> <p>When he had parked his car, I walked around, taking him in hand and making my way up the front door. I opened the door and we both just stood, looking at each other. His beautiful smile lit up my face when he was looking at me through the dark, empty hallway.</p> <p>"Don't be afraid to do that, David. I trust you. I've always trusted you, and I can do this for you if you want," I said.</p> <p>"Well then, I guess I don't need to say I want to, right? I just want you to show me, honey."</p> <p>"Yeah, right. I know you can. You go about getting ready. I'll meet you out front. When you're ready, just turn right into the driveway. There's the garage door opener in there," I said. "I'll pull behind you on the left," I added, pointing toward the garage door.</p> <p>"And after you're done, come in and kiss me, okay?" I told him as I opened the door and led him to the door. I pushed the door open and pulled him inside. Once the door closed on us, I turned to face him. I couldn't believe how turned on I was. My panties were sopping wet, and my nipples stood out of the fabric of my shirt. God, I wanted him. His eyes looked up at me. I wanted to do everything with him, but as much as I wanted to go further. I wanted it to be a dream come true. I wanted to experience everything we had before meeting.</p> <p>"If you're okay with this, just go ahead," I said as I took his hand and pulled him inside. Once we were in the bedroom, I turned back toward him and closed the door. I sat down on the bed and pulled him to me. I kissed him on the mouth, then the cheeks, and pulled away only long enough to say, "Just do what I ask of you!" Once I had his lips back on mine, I pushed him onto his back, kissing him all over his face. In that position, my hands still had a little control, and I reached for his hand to move it up my thigh, which was again pressed against my pussy. I ran it all along my body, and found myself getting hard immediately. I broke from the kiss and turned to look at him. I felt that I needed to do this. I had never taken anything for granted before, so I was curious if I thought he could pull it off.</p> <p>"Are you really okay with me being your friend again?" he asked.</p> <p>"I'm okay with this," I answered.
