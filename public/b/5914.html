Her eyes went wide and the tears were cascading down.</p> <p>I was not sure what I wanted with my wife, or even the boys, or maybe anything else, but I knew I didn't want to spoil the surprise that was to come. I pushed forward, trying to go deeper into her but it was much too hard. She cried out, "Nooo! No!" but I didn't force myself as I had been afraid she might stop me. I felt like any slow motion would do. I heard her grunt with each thrust, "No!"</p> <p>I felt the muscles in my cock starting to contract as I pushed my hips forward and I held on as hard as I could, I held off a few more seconds before I could stop myself. I felt her muscles tense as she came but I had no intention of ever coming in her.</p> <p>She cried out again, "Oh God!" before a long sigh followed it. Then she cried out, "What are you doing to me?" She was still in a state of shock as she looked down at me. Her eyes were red and her lips were swollen, and I knew that they had gotten red and angry as they spoke.</p> <p>Suddenly it dawned on me what it meant, for at that moment I could not care why, just that she had given me this pleasure as the boys did with her. I pulled my cock out, the cum pouring into her as the last few drops were pumped out. I stood there, my cock hard, the first thing I had thought of doing during my little tryst with her young lover as I left the room. But I had no idea why.</p> <p>The next four nights we slept together. We were fucking together, and I still felt guilty about it. I knew a lot of folks had heard me and her, and even asked her to come home with me. After that, I was too afraid of what could happen. I started to get angry.</p> <p>Three nights later, the phone rang at my parents' house. It was their first conversation on the phone with no hint of any kind of answer that night.</p> <p>"Heather, how are you?" he said on the phone. "What's up? Can I come over?"</p> <p>"Well... No, not really; you're all right. We can talk later."</p> <p>"Tell me what's up."</p> <p>"Well, we talked before. He started by asking me to come home with him and to take care of him. I said okay, so we talked for a while but then he asked about you, and when I said I was not that good at fore play, he started to laugh. I think he might have said that he was jealous of all the fun he was getting with you. Then he started to be very quiet and then started to say..."</p> <p>"Nancy, what is it? Tell me what is going on."</p> <p>After he had done that, I didn't want the whole story. I just wanted to hear what he was telling me.</p> <p>"And now, I'm going to tell you how he is feeling."</p> <p>"Nancy, where are you? He's not going to come over."</p> <p>"Well, I'll probably be home next Wednesday."</p> <p>"We can talk now. He's not going to come over tomorrow."</p> <p>We talked about this for a while longer and then I had to go to the phone. A minute later, I saw the phone on the wall. I dialed the number, "Hello."</p> <p>I could hear nothing from the other end of the line.</p> <p>'Hello?"</p> <p>"Mrs. Nelson?" The voice on the phone spoke. It was a woman's voice. I just heard it.</p> <p>"What's your problem? Why is this man speaking on the phone? Where is he?</p> <p>"He's at home this time next week," she said.</p> <p>"Why are you talking to him on the phone? Did you call him when you came home? When did you come home?"</p> <p>"Well, it just seemed that he was having some fun. Then he started to laugh again, and then he laughed. So?"</p> <p>"Nancy, please just tell me the fucking truth. Why is he laughing and calling me at home when we can have all this fun together? Did I really just say that? Is he jealous?"</p> <p>"Of course you did dear," she said. "Why would anybody say that about you? Tell me. You know why you were laughing."</p> <p>"Because the boys came home and youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
