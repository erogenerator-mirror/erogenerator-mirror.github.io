The taste of the ice cream was stronger. She licked it again, sucking on it and tasting the salt and spice and everything.</p> <p>She moaned and pushed, sliding her pussy up on her knees so that her ass rubbed the head of his cock. She felt the tip of his cock and the length. She pushed back against him. She felt the head of him, and her insides, open and ready.</p> <p>He groaned, his hands pressing her chest down, making her nipples press against his chest. He moaned, her nipples hard as he slid inside her.</p> <p>She felt him all the way and stopped. He didn't move. He stayed with her, not moving. She looked at him. He was completely still, her pussy still pulsing with pleasure. He wasn't touching her, but a drop of sweat was running down her breasts.</p> <p>He slowly pulled himself out.</p> <p>She felt full and empty and she closed her eyes, biting her lip, and opening her legs back and to the side to allow him to get back in again. He pulled her onto him, this time in long thrusts. She felt them, the way her own pussy gripped him, the size of the cock. He pushed up into her and she moaned her pleasure into the air. He fucked her.</p> <p>Her ass rested on his balls with only the ridge of his helmet touching her insides. He pulled down on her nipples, and she felt him fill her up. He leaned back on his hands, his face just visible against her shoulders, his tongue licking the sweat on his own lips.</p> <p>He moaned her name, and she felt himself.</p> <p>He came in her. She felt him spasm inside her, filling her to capacity. She was so full of his cum that they were both out of breath after they hadn't fucked yet.</p> <p>He pulled out, and she sighed. He rubbed his cock with her body. She felt hot to him, flushed, and satisfied. He pulled her hands up to her face and kissed her hand. She smiled. They were too tired to talk.</p> <p>He pulled her off of him, so that she fell onto her side. He lay beside her and reached down to stroke her face. He ran his finger down her cheek.</p> <p>He kissed her cheek and ran his finger down her jaw. He slid two fingers into her lips and she opened and accepted them. He pulled her lips on his lips and they sucked and explored each other.</p> <p>She moved her hands on his face, finding his fingers to be more sensitive than she remembered.</p> <p>He kissed her lips again and she moved closer to him. She felt the warmth of his skin, the hard planes of muscle under the skin of his skin. The warmth of his hair. She leaned in and kissed him. His lips moved down her neck and she arched her neck so she could press her breast against his chest. She had the softness of his skin, and he knew how to work his mouth and fingers.</p> <p>He held her waist and started kissing lower to her collarbone and down to her cleavage. He felt her moan as he brushed her nipple. He kissed the top of her breast and then moved back up to her nipple where he nibbled and sucked, teasing until she couldn't stand it any more. She felt him lick, flicking, sucking her nipple and her back arched.</p> <p>He moved his hand on her stomach to find her crotch.</p> <p>He knelt beside her, kissing her stomach. She felt his tongue run across the top of her pubic hair. She was so sensitive there. Her legs opened for him as he kissed down and then back up again. He slipped his fingers inside her, and she moaned softly. He ran her fingers through his hair and gently slid them down her slit and down again. When they reached her clit she arched her hips, raising the bed. He slid a finger inside her, and she moaned as he did it slowly, teasing in just a little. He felt the tension. His cock was straining with the excitement of what he was about to do with her. Her pussy and ass clenched and then relaxed, as though it had a permanent hold on him.</p> <p>He slid his hands up and down her body. He found her breasts, her nipples were stiff. He gently rolled them around in his hands and watched them grow hard and pointed. He moved his hands up her body, cupping each breast as he kissed first her mouth then her neck. He slid his hands down, down along her legs, down between her thighs, and when he reached that special place, he slid his fingers inside her. She moaned at his touch and moved her hips so he could touchâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
