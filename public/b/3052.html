I smiled and put a hand on her bottom.</p> <p>"It's okay. I was hoping to hear your voice, I mean," I said. Her hand brushed away the hair at the nape of my neck. Then she lifted my shirt and took my nipple in her mouth, gently sucking it.</p> <p>Giggling, she backed away to watch as I raised my shirt, my eyes following her. She unbuttoned my shirt, then I raised my arms over my head while she slid my bra across my breasts with practiced ease. After a few moments, I stood up and slowly reached behind me and with one smooth motion, slipped the bra down so that the rest of my breasts were revealed. I cupped my breasts and pushed them together as she pushed me back down on the bed in front of her.</p> <p>I don't think she took her eyes off the sight for a while, but she did take one of my hands in hers and raise my hand up to her mouth. She kissed the middle of her palm then pressed her lips around my middle finger and rolled the tip around. She put her tongue out at the bottom so I could slide it across her bottom lip. She lifted her bottom and kissed the palm of my hand in return.</p> <p>She took my finger and slipped my middle to her mouth. I slid it across her bottom lip, rubbing it with the tip. I slid my free hand down her back and rubbed her ass. She pushed her bottom into my hand, grinding it as I squeezed her.</p> <p>She pulled away.</p> <p>"You know that you're doing a pretty good job if you know what I mean," I said. She reached towards my breasts, pulling the skin over mine and licking it.</p> <p>"You're a very naughty girl," she said with mock disapproval. "You know that you can't do it with someone you've only just met?"</p> <p>"Yeah. You're the one who should be doing this?" I looked at her in confusion. She wasn't angry with me. She was just surprised I didn't. But she seemed a little taken back by my confusion.</p> <p>"Is it just me, or with you?" She looked a little worried.</p> <p>"Well... not really, I wasn't exactly on the pill," I answered, blushing. "I mean, I don't think it's cheating to have an enema."</p> <p>It took a few seconds before she said I could, but she didn't seem mad. The confusion that I was feeling had been replaced by the anticipation of what she was about to do. She pulled my pants and panties off, sitting up in the bed. I had taken my shoes off, so I rolled the socks off carefully before lying on my back. She crawled over me and sat down on the side of the bed next to me, her breasts brushing against mine.</p> <p>She leaned down and kissed me, running her fingertips down the side of my face to my neck as she continued to play her hands over me. When her hand slipped down to slide between my spread legs, I took in air, almost forgetting to breathe. When a minute passed, she was leaning back and watching me intently once more. Finally, she pulled off her sweater and pants, exposing her own body to me.</p> <p>She removed her shirt and was standing in front of me. I was lying on the bed, naked except for her panties and bra. Her breasts were slightly larger than mine. Her nipples were long and slightly pointed. I had the first thing I noticed about her when she came to me. They were pink and soft and I kissed them before sucking them into my mouth. She pulled the hair away from my face and leaned down to kiss me again. One of her legs touched mine. I rolled on the bed, pressing my body forward until she was straddling my thighs. I reached my hands around her back, my fingers searching for those small breasts I had admired earlier. The tips of my fingers found the hard little nubs of her nipple through her bra.</p> <p>"Mmm...you're right, it'd probably be cheating to have you in it," she said quietly. I moved my hands and cupped one of her breasts. It was pale and smooth, more like a real, full, firm orb than one with a pinkish-red centerline. The nipple was as hard as a pencil eraser. As I squeezed its firmness, she leaned her chest forward, opening her mouth and taking my nipple between her lips. She sucked gently while I took the other, pulling the other with my hand.</p> <p>She moved her hand to rest against the side of my abdomen through my thin cotton shorts.</p> <p>"I love to have panties on," she said. I raised my hips upward to meet her. Her hands slipped back to the sideâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
