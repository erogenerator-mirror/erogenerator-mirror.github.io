He was tall and thin; and had glasses on. He wasn't wearing jeans and he was wearing a blue shirt that was loose and open. He stopped when the door was closed while I was still looking at his face and he asked me if it was OK to come in.</p> <p>As I took a step forward he turned his back to me. He had a beer in his hand and he was looking directly down the hall to me. The way he was standing with his back to the door was making it impossible for me to take my eyes away from his face; that face turned a bit more red when I turned my head to him a bit, but it was nothing.</p> <p>When I saw his face I knew it was going to be a fight and when he looked at me I couldn't believe I was standing there, a guy who looked like his body was about to be beaten. I looked into those eyes and saw a man, probably the owner of the place I lived, I had to do a damn sightier job than that to make the effort to say anything. Just as I said just the thing, I saw some of my old stuff was hanging at a distance and I turned away a bit.</p> <p>My eyes followed him as he took a few steps forward from his door, then continued back to me, so I followed him. He told me to come in and sit down on the couch in front of he bar that was opened across the room.</p> <p>"We didn't have the couch for the night and I don't want to make you pay for all the beer."</p> <p>He laughed. "So, you thought you were going to be sitting on an empty couch for just a drink. I'm surprised you didn't mind the view."</p> <p>I didn't say anything. He went into his kitchen to refill our drinks and returned half an hour later with two more.</p> <p>"You should take off your clothes; I'm going to sit with the door open." He told me as I stood there. "Sit down."</p> <p>I turned and walked around the couch to sit down but he pushed it to me and then sat it down on a chair.</p> <p>"No, no, no, no. Take off your clothes." He told me firmly.</p> <p>No! I thought when the door was closed.</p> <p>"Oh God, please don't make me do that." I finally spoke softly as I slowly reached out my hands and began taking off my clothes. I turned to look at him and saw his eyes still fixed on me.</p> <p>"No, don't do that." I finally said.</p> <p>I stood there, unsure of what to do. He moved closer to me until his arms were in front of him. I couldn't believe just about to walk out of the bedroom totally naked, with his shirt unbuttoned, pants undone and his shirt wide open.</p> <p>Then he pulled me toward him and began kissing me. His hands roamed up and down my upper body leaving trails of fire on my skin when he touched me. When he looked down at my face he told me to turn away. I did, not knowing exactly what to say, but I didn't say anything right away. He pushed my shoulders back down and I felt what I thought was a blindfold over my eyes so I was really tied to the end of the bed. I could feel his hands all over me, his body pressed against mine and I could feel his erection in my stomach. I felt his hands begin to caress me, the feel of his hands on my skin only made me want him more, which he did. Then he moved to my lower abdomen.</p> <p>"Not this way, my good girl." He whispered into my ear as he pushed my legs apart. With one hand he began stroking my inner lips, touching them between his fingers while his other hand began to caress my breasts. He lowered his mouth to my neck, licking my ear. His fingers were now inside me and he could feel I was already so wet and ready.</p> <p>"I don't have many more clothes."</p> <p>"Good, because I haven't taken off any." I heard him say.</p> <p>He slowly pulled his finger out of me and looked me in the eyes, as he said this, his body slid away from me to the end of the bed and lay on it. Then he turned around and pushed me down, over the bed, until I was lying over it, my head was resting on its back, but my face was now at the foot of the bed, my legs up in the air, my face next to the top of the bed. I could feel his body above mine, pressing me into the floor.</p> <p>My left leg was stretched out under me and I could feel my pussy lips spreadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
