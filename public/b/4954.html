"That means I never get to cum. Right?" she said playfully.</p> <p>Her mouth once again was at my clit, working its magic over me again, moving up and down over my sensitive nub, never missing a beat with her fingers. I was moaning loudly now and could feel myself building quickly toward an earth-shattering orgasm.</p> <p>"Oh, God, you're going to make me cum." I told her breathlessly. "I'm going to come. I'm going to cum for you."</p> <p></p> <p>With one final push at me, her fingers stopped their motion on my clit. As her mouth returned to my clit, I started to cum. I held my head against the side of the desk as all my muscles worked in unison to take another huge wave of cum from my body. I could feel it start in the back of my body and radiate outward along my stomach. I didn't realize I'd taken it until I came hard and fast. My legs gave out as I collapsed on the floor. Her fingers didn't let up at all.</p> <p>"Oh my God," she said as she moved to stand.</p> <p>I stood up myself and looked over at her, smiling as my legs dropped to the floor, my skirt was still around my hips. She had dropped to her knees in front of me and was gently rubbing her hand up and down over my legs, feeling the warm, smooth flesh that she had found there.</p> <p>With a kiss, she pulled herself together and said "Here."</p> <p>She pulled her skirt down and the panties stayed in place. She stood up, then stood up and reached under her skirt, and pulling her panties off, said "Here."</p> <p>She dropped her skirt back into place and turned and walked away. I watched her beautiful ass swaying seductively in front of me. She gave herself another spin and walked out. I looked back, watching her as her heart began beating faster and faster.</p> <p>She returned a few minutes later and sat on the edge of my desk, next to the chair I was sitting in. "I need a hug," she said. "Come over."</p> <p>I hesitated. We were on the floor in the doorway, standing next to each other. I knew she felt safe and I knew I could trust her again. I just hoped we could be friends before we went our separate ways. And, no way should she feel awkward in our new relationship now. She had just taken what seemed like more than it was, and she knew that as long as I stayed in her life I would still want her even more.</p> <p>"Come here," she said softly, patting the seat next to her.</p> <p>I walked across the desk until I was next to her on the seat. I leaned over to kiss her. My breasts were now pressed against her. I reached up to slide my fingers under her bra cups and felt her nipples harden. I ran my fingers over them, feeling the heat of her excitement. She reached down to take hold of my hand. We moved slowly across the desk towards the door. We stood next to each other, still holding our hands, watching the passing of the key. It was time we went our separate ways.</p> <p>When the door closed, I was in a quandary. The way things were, I could always tell when the other one was about to make a move, and I still felt comfortable about it. But at the same time, I didn't want to let her take the initiative. We must be able to talk about a lot of things, right?</p> <p>As she closed the door and locked it, I walked out into the hallway to the bathroom. I turned on the light then put on a robe and went to my room. I sat down as I heard a knock on the door.</p> <p>"Come in." I said.</p> <p>She entered the room and quickly closed the door.</p> <p>"I have a meeting scheduled in a couple of hours. Are you still in your underwear? I'm not sure if I can forgive you for leaving the door with nothing on." I said with a smile.</p> <p>I sat down on the bed as I felt my face burning bright red.</p> <p>"And I'll be doing this, in front of you," she said calmly.</p> <p>"That's okay, I'm sure there are other ways not to be embarrassed by this," I said as I took her hand. "But, what do you think I should do after a few weeks away from you?"</p> <p>"Well, it's been amazingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
