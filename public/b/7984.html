I began kissing my way down her neck. She was wearing a deep-red silk robe. Her skin was warm to my touch, a pleasant contrast against the wet, scruffy fabric. Her body was beautiful: long legs, firm bottom, and the roundness of her butt was very pronounced.</p> <p>"I love to play with my own body," she continued, "but I'm afraid it's only natural to want to get it all, just like when I'm wearing a swim trunks." Her voice was breathy. I looked down at her thighs, and then began kissing up her legs again, this time starting at the knees. I was enjoying the feel of the soft flesh there, while I caressed the sensitive skin around the area. Her lips were soft and pink, and I felt her breathing increase. I kissed along them, feeling the taut texture of the skin, the firm ridges under my lips. I moved away and looked down at her stomach. Her skin was very firm and flat, and the muscles in her legs and bottom moved as I slowly licked them. She was moaning, and I could hear the sounds of her pleasure.</p> <p>She looked at me with glazed eyes, and began moaning even louder, "Oh, baby! What do you think you're doing? Don't tease me like this ... not here..."</p> <p>I kissed the top of her mound. She was already wet, and the hair was soft and golden. I was excited at the smell of her. She squirmed, and tried to take more weight off me. Oh, yes. More of this.</p> <p>I moved my mouth to her clitoris and began licking it, first one side, then the other. She tasted wonderful, so fresh and sweet and just right for me to enjoy. I used my tongue to gently, yet not deliberately, explore the flesh beneath, and then, again just as slowly and teasingly, teased it again. She was breathing hard, and it sounded as if her heart beating against her body. She was gasping now, and I could feel a strong climax coming soon. I sucked on her clitoris, but it was not hard. She was moaning too loudly, and there was a lot of her own passion. This girl knew how to make me feel good. I began to make slow circles around her clitoris with my tongue, feeling the smooth skin, moving up to brush her clitoris with my nose. She bucked, and she was moaning as I began licking around her clit again. Her whole body shook when I touched her clitoris lightly, and she was groaning loudly.</p> <p>Then, she pushed my head away. She looked at it and said, "No, don't stop." I stood up from the bed. "This is what you wanted? That you wanted me to do?"</p> <p>"No, you're too big," I answered. There had been no urgency in our lovemaking. She was going to get that, now. "Let me feel you in me."</p> <p>She looked disappointed, but agreed anyway. I pulled out the condom. It would stay in the condom, and when she was aroused, it would feel moist and warm inside, on her and everything else about her. She was excited. I began to remove the rubber, leaving it in place. She turned over on all fours, her legs dangling over the bed, and looked at me. She wasn't scared of me now, she was ready.</p> <p>"Oh, baby, I need you inside me."</p> <p>I climbed back on the bed behind her. She held her hands out to me with her hands, and I took those two things in my arms. I kissed her cheek and neck, and then went lower to kiss the base of the hair at her pussy. I kissed the base of her belly just underneath her navel, and reached my hand up the small swatch of her mound. I felt her excitement through the silk of her legs, and she shivered slightly.</p> <p>"I want to feel your penis inside me," she said. "I want to feel the fullness of your cock."</p> <p>'Let's try it," I answered. She moved herself down the bed so that I could get up from underneath her and lay on my back, facing her feet on the floor. Then she lay on me and straddled me. My penis pressed through the silk material of her robe up to her clitoris. "Oh!" She moaned. Her warmth felt good on my penis, she rubbed herself back and forth along it until my dick was as hard as steel, which felt more like the steel of a rod. Then she put me into her vagina.</p> <p>"It's nice and soft," she whispered. She guided my penis into herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
