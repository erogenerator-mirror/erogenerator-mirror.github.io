Before she entered the room, she leaned over him, placing one hand on the bed. This caused him to slide a bit on the bed. He groaned as she grabbed his tie and yanked.</p> <p>"Don't get me wrong, you need to come back here now," she said, as she moved on him, "but I want you to go sit in my chair, on the bed. Put your feet spread apart, and hold them up with the chair's arms so I can tie you to the chair's bedposts." With that, she tied both his feet and then left the room. He heard the front door close as she left him that way. The chair was now positioned just right facing the bed. He could see her sitting down and his head and pussy were now pointed up, her legs spread wide. His entire body was trembling. "Are you ready, baby?" she asked him. "Yes. I need you. More than you are. I'm ready. Now take me with you. Take my pussy, my ass, my mouth. "</p> <p>With that, she sat up and grabbed the rope that she had been tying his hands at the head of the bed. As she pulled them apart to reveal his genitals, she moved her hand to his thighs. As she had grabbed the rope around his legs, she began pulling it higher and higher. Finally, she was pulling the rope completely off his throbbing cock. "Oh, it needs to go inside of me now!" she said with a smile. Taking his feet, she tied them together and moved them so they were on one side of his feet, he was now trapped and he knew she could do whatever she wanted with either one of his legs and he couldn't move them, he was in no danger.</p> <p>She grabbed the base of his cock with one hand and began stroking it and rolling it slowly. Leaning in to kiss him, she began moaning softly. Her tongue slowly ran over his lips and gently probed one or both of his teeth. The smell of her perfume was intoxicating. He moaned as he felt his cock begin to pulse in her hand. She took him in and squeezed around the base.</p> <p>She had been in the middle of a large number of girls. She was the one in charge and the one who controlled him. The last thing he remembered was her asking him to sit on top, which he loved. She was in control. She now had complete control over him. He lay in her arms and she stroked his body with such fervour that the bed shook. She looked at him with those sparkling eyes and knew what she was about to do. He felt she was not done. She slowly pulled down the hem of her dress. He felt her hands on his thighs. Slipping a finger under the elastic of what he realized was one of his shoes she slowly pulled the right stocking off. She then pulled his knee toward her and he felt her legs wrap the leg of his chair and pull her to him. Her pussy was right in line with his face. He lifted his head up and looked into her eyes as he kissed her deeply, his tongue plunging into her to the hilt. He then pulled his head up, he smiled and she moaned when he released himself from her kiss.</p> <p>"I think it's time baby," she said smiling, as she pulled her dress back down. As he lay on the bed, he was trying to catch his breath and then he heard her say, "It's about time we started making love." He could not deny her any longer. He felt her move to his head. He could not resist her. He could not stop her as she began kissing him, then she slipped her panties to the side, slipped her fingers inside him and began rubbing herself. The look in his eyes was all he could take. He grabbed his cock and began stroking himself as she moved her head and began to kiss him again. He felt her body pressed close to his, her breasts pressing against his chest. He moved his hand, the one that he had not touched himself, up to her breast and began to fondle them. He let his mouth move to her neck, nibbling and licking as she let out small sighs and moans. She then took his hand and replaced his finger with his tongue. He was lost in her as he licked her neck and she moaned with each stroke of his tongue. She began to kiss his lips and kiss his face as she continued to rub her pussy up and down over his mouth, pressing it against his face. He finally reached her nipple and began to gently squeeze it. He pulled lightly and she responded immediately. His fingers on her other breast began to pull and roll her nipple between his fingers, the areola being pulled.</p> <p>She then lifted her head, smiling and said, "Is that what you want babyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
