Don't try to get over us, just love each other. I'll do all your dirty work, don't you worry."</p> <p>They went back to sleep in each others arms.</p> <p>The next morning she woke to light kissing and sucking on her nipples, her love was gone. She was still in her nightdress, and could imagine what my love is doing with her morning. I was going to be dreaming.</p> <p>As my fingers got up, I went over to the nightdress to give them a kiss. When my lips touched hers, they just melted from passion. Her lips were now dry and her sex.</p> <p>I was a little anxious that her morning might get better. I also wanted the sensation of knowing that I gave them what they deserved.</p> <p>She just opened her eyes and with a wicked smile asked me to join her.</p> <p>We left the toilet together and walked over for the shower. As we touched each other, I had the urge to hold her, to feel her soft breasts and feel her wonderful love again. The thought that I might give it to her while we were naked, took on a stronger part of the lust in me. There was no doubt about our relationship, there was no doubt whatsoever. I wanted it. It had to. It had to.</p> <p>When we got out, we dried each others hair and then headed into the kitchen to clean up. I was trying to make the greatest meal I had ever made for myself. It seemed to be a lot different every morning, but it felt the same. The smell of the food, the taste of it, the soft sounds of the dishes, and the sense of having a strong life with her in my presence. This made me feel good, as well as sexy. I was glad that she liked the taste and smell of her morning, before the lovemaking, before I met her, and before how she loved me. She made tea and sat down to eat. She leaned back in her chair on her elbow and looked at me. When she did see me she looked deep in thought. I noticed that there was a sparkle in that wonderful eye that I had not seen before.</p> <p>"What is going on?" She asked.</p> <p>I went back and looked at her.</p> <p>"I know, I've been thinking about you, how I wanted you this morning. I knew it, I know now. Last night it wasn't you. It was you. I felt I could share you with her. I knew that if I ever met you again in my life I would want to, wanted to make love with you, and maybe just for a night."</p> <p>I leaned back in my chair and started to rub her shoulder. She looked into my eyes and said, "I know it is wrong, but I really want you, but I've had several dreams about you, but my first was about that wonderful love, it's just that this wonderful time, for her, will never, ever come between us. And I love you more for not doing this for the first time, and the first time for us. I also wanted to tell you the other night, about all the love I have already told you, but it just didn't feel right, yet. I felt more hurt, now than the pain of losing you, of knowing I will never see your beautiful face again. But I know that we have already made that choice, it was the right thing to do, and we have made it permanent."</p> <p>As she said that she opened her eyes and looked in that great blue. "No not forever. A few times I have already done this, I do wish I could do it again, but I feel I did want to."</p> <p>She sat there, looking into my eyes as they were looking out the window, holding my hand tightly.</p> <p>"I love you, and I think I love you."</p> <p>"I love you too" I replied.</p> <p>We finished eating and she went to the toilet, I washed my hands and made sure that all was cleaned up and that there was no trace of our previous love juice, and we headed back to the living room.</p> <p>When she sat down her hand was lightly brushing at my leg.</p> <p>"I hope that I wasn't wrong, about you. I'm not one of those men that will make mistakes with a second look, about their first time, I have more than enough experience, and not all men, I'm just not one of those kind of guys."</p> <p>She continued talking about this for another couple of minutes.</p> <p>"I love having you to myself, I can't think about anything else. I just feel like I just wanted you to be mine, for us to be one. If this is what I can do for you and love for me, then itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
