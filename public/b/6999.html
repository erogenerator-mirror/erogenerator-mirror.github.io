She looked up, puzzled. She was in a bedroom.</p> <p>"Why would you think I was doing something?" I asked, surprised. Was I going to have to say something else? I'm not a prude and I've done plenty of things, but still – there was something about her. I turned to look behind me.</p> <p>The door was open and I could see her standing there, barefooted and holding a razor in her right hand. I guess she wanted to do something else – to clean up a little.</p> <p>She was a beautiful woman, about 5'5, 130 pounds, long brown hair, big blue eyes, and a smile and that body! She's got curves in all the right places. She had breasts that fit down to her ribcage. I've noticed guys checking her out a lot, too. I have to admit – I'm liking the idea.</p> <p>I'm not used to this kind of activity. I mean, I've been with a couple of girls in high school, but I never went any further than that – they always got to me! I really hate it! But it was nice to see that she was taking care of me.</p> <p>My mind was racing; what the heck? I was just going to ask permission from my wife and, like that, I never asked her to do stuff, so this was nothing – okay, it was just a little weird.</p> <p>"Well, I'm not sure I should, uh…." I stammered, feeling the familiar churning in my loins and, for the second time, I looked down at my semi erect cock. "Uh, you know, uh…."</p> <p>She smiled at me, but she never looked like that again. Asking permission was just too uncomfortable, too weird. My cock started to come into prominence.</p> <p>"Why, sorry," she said, as she turned away, looking up at me. "I just wasn't thinking and then I saw you, um…." She was looking back down, the skin of her breasts glinting under the light-colored fabric of her shirt. "I was thinking you, maybe we could just go back to my room and do it again, um… I guess I would, if you said so." She had a sort of embarrassed grin on her face.</p> <p>"Sure," I said, my nerves showing. I was pretty uncomfortable, I mean, I wasn't feeling anything. Just watching her was too much. There's something about a girl that has this effect on me. I mean, for example, my cock – which was still stiff, not quite hard, standing up straight and twitching slightly, like it was about to burst and come all over. But her attitude and that smile, the sort of face that you find sort of erotic, I felt like I could die for. It just sort of, well, it started to subside some. Maybe she sensed that and smiled again.</p> <p>"I guess you're going to have to show me," she said, sounding surprised.</p> <p>It took a little longer than I was expecting. The last thing I did was to walk over to the bed and pull up my pants. She didn't move, so I just took that as a cue to leave. I really don't mind if I look the other way. I figured a nice little show would be appreciated. I turned around and looked for the door to the bedroom. I started to turn away, my cock still hard and still pointing straight up in the air, thinking maybe I could just walk away.</p> <p>But I just stopped and walked away.</p> <p>I looked back and watched her walk down the hall and look into the open door. I mean, I know she has the house to herself, but it's just hard to miss her coming out of our bedroom. She opened the door slowly, the light shining through it.</p> <p>"God, how do I get any more of these surprises!"</p> <p>I couldn't even say what I was thinking!</p> <p>"You're right," she said, sounding kind of excited, like we had some mutual fantasy and now I was going to see what it was! "You can leave, if you want," I thought. I thought for a minute, wondering if I should actually do it. But something about her, her voice, her demeanor, it just gave me an idea. My cock, though, stirred back to life.</p> <p>We were alone in the back of my house.</p> <p>"Here," she said, holding out her right hand. I was so relieved she just touched me there, touching me as if it were her doing it. As the blood raced through my brain again, I looked at her eyes, looking for approval. She didn't look.</p> <p>"Turn around," she said, as she turned to face—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
