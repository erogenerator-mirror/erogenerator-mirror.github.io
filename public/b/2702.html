Her head was lying in the grass beside her bed. She still didn't know how long her head was there. The one who gave her a handjob last night had worked on her a little longer than the other.</p> <p>"Are you still dreaming about me?" he asked. His eyes still got wide under hers.</p> <p>"N-n, don't say that! I just couldn't fall asleep in your bed again!" she panted. A soft whine bubbled up from her chest. "But if that's even what you think, you're still more than a little interested!"</p> <p>"Come here." He said, pulling her close to his body. Her arms came around his neck and slid down his body.</p> <p>He pulled her dress off of her body and pulled his shirt off as well. As she turned around, he pulled her down on him and kissed her deeply.</p> <p>When he broke the kiss and looked around for a shirt, he saw her on the grass, legs up in the air in front of him, one leg across his waist. She was wearing a low cut lavender bra. His mouth came forward and covered her breast in a long, wet kiss. She gasped. He put a hand under her thigh and pulled it to the side. His head moved from her breast to move between her legs where they were kissing some more. He could smell the sweet smell of her hair and her sex. He loved her taste. So was she.</p> <p>"Mmm, you taste good," he whispered. His lips touched her bare pussy; it twitched. He didn't know if he could make her cum again.</p> <p>"But you'll get that you bastard! I'm getting excited!" she growled as she started getting him ready.</p> <p>"You won't have this chance again."</p> <p>"Oh god," she moaned. It was getting harder to breathe, but she was losing control anyway. She was so hot; he could feel it.</p> <p>He moved on top of her in the grass.</p> <p>"I want you inside me," she said.</p> <p>"Hmmmm, I get it," he replied as he took her legs, moved back up to her stomach, and lay on top of her, still kissing her.</p> <p>"No!" she cried, "you better not!"</p> <p>This time it was his turn to be on top. He raised an eyebrow in query. Her head turned and looked toward the trees. It was just past the peak. A shadow fell over the edge between the trees. A big dark figure stepped up and moved over the rock wall, stood directly in front of her.</p> <p>"I'm not going to hurt you," she purred, her fingers moved to grasp his hard shaft where he was standing up, "I want to watch you fuck me!" she gasped as she watched him. She was already wet.</p> <p>"No, no! I want to see you fuck me!" he laughed. He was still very aroused and he knew she would want this. He felt her legs wrap around him, then heard her cry out as he filled her up.</p> <p>"FUCKK!!" she screamed as he filled her, "FUUUUCK!" she continued to scream as he kept thrusting into her. Her scream was so intense that she couldn't control herself any longer. She started to pull her legs up into the earth as if she was pulling a lifeline.</p> <p>He was thrusting into her in a single motion, her legs kept pulling around him so he had control now. He pulled her legs to his chest so she was straddling his waist. He could feel the sweat running down his body and feel the warmth of her skin in the cool grass. The whole universe was a part of him that had never been in possession of.</p> <p>She felt him grow inside her, knew what he was feeling. The whole world turned on itself. The world was spinning and exploding. The world seemed different when people were in control. It was less frenetic than when they were fucking, but not as frenetic as this one. This one had no place inside her.</p> <p>"You make me feel so fucking good! I can no longer believe this is happening. Fuuuuuck!" she cried out.</p> <p>"We should get going," he said. He reached around her and felt her body on top of him. He turned her face down to him and they kissed again. Her breasts were hard against him but very soft. Her sex was still wet. They started rolling around under the grass, getting him back into the rhythm they were using.</p> <p>"Oh, god," she moaned when she felt his big thick manhood start to move inside of her.</p> <p>"I thought someone had died?" he laughedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
