In one quick action I threw the cover off the bed and pulled her body onto my. We hugged and kiss passionately as I reached up and felt her breasts, as I kissed she felt the wetness run down her legs, but she didn’t protest. This was the moment of truth after years of teasing and fantasising.</p> <p>She kissed my lips and I could taste the saltiness of her lipstick. Our tongues explored each other like we had in college and I slid my hand down her back and to the top of her thighs where I took a quick grasp and moved it around towards her waistband. She took my hand and guided it to her bottom, but was unable to get my hand under the waistband. I kissed the cheek, as I began to rub her cheek, trying to lift the thin material down. I was still too gentle on the outside, but when the lips made their way into the crack I took the advantage of her by pulling her panties down, sliding them easily off.</p> <p>Her naked bottom was even slimmer than mine and I knew I wouldn’t be able to control myself, as she began to wiggle her bottom suggestively indicating she wanted it.</p> <p>I kissed her lips then moved my mouth up until I met with the warm softness of her cheeks and slid under the thin material of her panties. The feeling was electric and I had to have her immediately. Slowly I pulled the material away and her buttocks sprang out, completely devoid of any covering. Slowly I began to kiss and lick the soft cheeks, running my tongue over the area which had been covered only by the soft and satiny skin of her vagina. She had a faint smell of the juices running from her and I was getting turned on by the thought of what I was about to do.</p> <p>She was becoming more and more aroused by the minute, so I raised a hand to her lips and slid my tongue between them, feeling her tongue flutter against me. I slowly worked my way back, until her lips were once again at the entrance of her vagina, a thin and delicate looking membrane. I pushed slightly feeling her hips start to move up and down.</p> <p>I began with long and slow licks up and down, licking around, just parting the area with my tongue as I went. She was very moist as I was running my tongue between her lips, the taste of her juice running over my tongue and teeth, but after a while I slid my tongue inside her vagina, taking it completely in between my pursed lips. She was beginning to thrust her hips up and down and could feel the excitement building in my own.</p> <p>Her orgasm was approaching and I was ready to give her what she wanted. I began to move my tongue on a slow motion, pushing it in and out, then licking her lips, probing around with my tongue. The faster the pace, harder the licking, and finally, suddenly, the wonderful sensation of her clitoris throbbing in my mouth, as I reached under with my hand to play with it with my fingers and the sensation sent another wave of pleasure through her body. She was shaking and writhing with excitement. I had never seen such a beautiful and erotic sight. Her hips were thrusting higher towards the fingers that probed her vagina and her vagina was pulsating with a continuous flow of semen as it sprayed out of her. I felt her buttocks move down and then stop as her whole body convulsed in ecstasy.</p> <p>I lay on the bed next to her and as she regained her composure she looked at me.</p> <p>“You really are a very good lover,” I replied as she sat up and gave me a kiss.</p> <p>“Now I am going to take you home and fuck your brains out,” I said to her, as my hand stroked her cheek.</p> <p>“That was great. Don’t go getting cold feet if you keep talking as I’m sure you’ll stay as long as you want,” she replied, with an impish smile.</p> <p>“No. We were doing OK.”</p> <p>“Don’t go now, I think I’m going to be very late, but there is a taxi waiting for you at the gate to pick you up after your lunch date,” she spoke, with a smile.</p> <p>“OK” I replied—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
