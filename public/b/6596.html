You can let him go now, unless you take him back to your bedroom."</p> <p>"But- but..."</p> <p>"Do you want me to help you back the way you came?"</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she said. "But I was... I just..." She turned to walk away but Mark pushed her back.</p> <p>"No. You're still with me, remember?" he asked, and she could feel him looking at her from the side, his hand sliding up her thigh.</p> <p>"But I'll be late." With that, her lover went back to his car and left her alone, on the couch.</p> <p>She was so used to how close she was making contact with other men, she couldn't even imagine what to say to him. The more she thought about it, which caused her body to respond as it should, the more she wanted him inside of her. There would be no going back. She needed him, she needed him to make her his.</p> <p>But as soon as she thought she could see his face in her mind, as her body betrayed her body and her brain reacted, she knew that there wasn't going to be any going back. Her own feelings for Mark were a different matter, but she needed him to have control of it.</p> <p>At home in her bed, she started to play her role, "How can Mark be so insistent that he won't make us have sex?" she wondered.</p> <p>"You heard me. I want you!"</p> <p>It took them two weeks to figure out that he had the right idea, and it didn't take long before her sexual awakening. She was constantly on edge, afraid that he was going to touch her or that he might push her towards a sexual encounter, or that he would make her say something that she didn't want to say. The only thing she did like about the whole situation was be able to keep her mind on her studies so she could focus better. But Mark and her relationship also had a natural attraction to each other. It was as if their whole relationship had turned to sex. It made her realize what that meant, and it meant more than just being a piece of ass. She found she loved being with Mark even more, and she also loved her lovers a lot. It was the one thing she didn't expect to happen with him, and it was the right thing to do at the present time.</p> <p>It was a year off from her first semester, but the summer between her junior and sophomore year started, and in that time she started looking for Mark. She decided that Mark was the perfect candidate to take control of what she knew was going to be a very difficult class. She wanted him to make her love him, not just to fuck her silly.</p> <p>They were sitting in their car, and Mark had one hand wrapped around her thigh, gently caressing the soft skin. He looked at her intently because he knew the look she was expecting when he would get an erection to begin with, and his hand moved higher up her thigh, touching her, but never too high up.</p> <p>"So much for your first semester," he said. "You're going to need to go all out, and we need to plan out how you will feel before you know it and then let loose."</p> <p>"I know," she said. "Don't worry about it. We'll find the right things to do that will help with my last semester."</p> <p>And with that statement, they were done. They were done as a couple with only a few weeks worth of time left. Their relationship would last for a long time as they waited for Mark.</p> <p>****</p> <p>The first time Mark and Vanessa had sex, they were doing it on his desk while in class. But since they never had an actual sex life, they never felt ready for it. It had to have been more than a few weeks since they had last had sex. So after class was over, they sat in his car at her apartment. She could feel his erection against her, and it was the first time she had felt the sexual charge she didn't mind.</p> <p>"I know I shouldn't have said anything," Vanessa said.</p> <p>"You did something right, and this is no different. I love you, and you have always made me feel so special. It's only right," Mark said. "But you'll have to come back to me."</p> <p>"Mark, I'm still a little scared. This is something that's been on my mind ever since I first told you about our sexual connection. I've had to come to grips with it for a while, and I can't explain to you what I was thinking when I told you."</p> <p>"What you did was right and good," Mark said. He reached out and touched her face, just a little, and smiled. "It'll come to youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
