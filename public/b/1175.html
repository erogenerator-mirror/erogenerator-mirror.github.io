She turned her face at the gentle waves that gently caressed her skin. She could feel their soft warmth against her naked body. In her dazed state, she closed her eyes for a moment. She would miss this weekend. She would miss the freedom of being in her own home. It was hard to know when, where, how, and with whom all the events had happened. She was a young, beautiful woman to begin with and who at the time had had a life changing effect upon her. If any man could have made a woman feel any woman would have felt the same way and if she had been turned out, he would have taken her. She remembered the feeling that she now had: a wave in her face, a smile on her face and her body slowly responding to the water. The power of that wave, combined with the intense, blissfully erotic feelings she had experienced, had sent her over the edge.</p> <p>She remembered the first time she had actually touched herself. She had been the one sitting on the beach in the summer, when she had had a long, leisurely, restful nap before getting up to check her email. It was early in the morning, only, she had not felt so safe to wake up and do something that she regretted later. She had taken herself up to her room, undressed and lay down on the bed. The memory of that first, incredible feeling of having that wave in her made her start to cry. It wasn't all so bad anymore. There was a peaceful, contented feeling between her thighs. It was the memory of how quickly it started to happen. The memory of the feeling that she got there...the feel of that wave in her body. There was a smile on her face and a contented feeling in her belly. There was more now: a feeling of joy between her legs, a feeling of pleasure, a joy of release. There was a smile on her face again, and she knew that she was not alone. More than ever she wanted to feel that warmth again. If she wanted to, she would make love for the first time in a long time.</p> <p>Now, here in her house, she had touched herself again. She had touched herself while lying in her bed, with the thoughts of her husband in her head. Now she had touched her breasts and her body. Her stomach was taut with desire and excitement from the sensations she had been feeling. She had let her hand rub over her stomach, her thighs and her pussy. She had let her fingers dance up from between her legs. Here and now, she had rubbed herself as hard and fast as she could. She felt the familiar surge of pleasure coming from her vagina. She pressed harder on herself and pressed harder onto her pussy. She had held her breath as the waves of pleasure rippled through her body. Her breathing had deepened and she had opened her eyes slightly.</p> <p>"Good morning, sleepy head. Did that feel good?"</p> <p>She did not answer.</p> <p>"Better than the other two?"</p> <p>She did not hear any response.</p> <p>"That's enough for today."</p> <p>She heard a buzzing sound at the back of her head.</p> <p>"What was that?"</p> <p>She heard the familiar buzzing sound. She felt the sound of a buzzing vibrator.</p> <p>"Oh my god, it's coming. I'm cumming. Oh, wow, oh, that was great. Yes, yes, oh!"</p> <p>All three of them heard and saw her. Both of them became aware of her presence. Her hand had stopped at her pussy and her fingers had stilled motion. The two men looked at each other then at the image of her.</p> <p>She looked at them: a smile, as she felt her wetness dripping down her leg. Her eyes had just opened a little and she had a beautiful look on her face.</p> <p>"WOW! That was so amazing! You two are amazing."</p> <p>They had been talking for an while and each of them had gotten an erection. It was the most erotic display they had ever seen and they both sat up in the lounge chair. There was a soft knock on the door.</p> <p>"Room service. I'm out of coffee and bread. Let's leave it till morning. I think I'm ready to take my showerâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
