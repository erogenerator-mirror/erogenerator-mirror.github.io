Her lips were soft, and smooth, they felt soft, too... as she moved away. I leaned back on the seat, the cool night air drying my back.</p> <p>She stood up, and pulled her blouse over her head, exposing her beautiful breasts. I reached out, grasping them between my hands, and began to gently caress them. My touch caused her to reach down and run her fingers through my hair, letting me know that I was doing a good job.</p> <p>Soon we were both naked, and I started to stroke her breasts, as her hand came to my cock, and began to rub me up and down.</p> <p>We stood in the doorway, holding each other close, and kissing passionately. My hands were exploring her body, and she found my nipples and began to tease each one, while her lips were busy on mine. Soon we were both panting, both ready to explode. I slid my hands between our bodies, stroking her through her shorts, getting a feel of her pussy hair, which was quite damp. Then I slipped a finger into her, and found her clit, and began to tease it, working her up into her first ever orgasm, with little tugs on my cock, and a groan.</p> <p>When she came down from her first orgasm, and we'd had our kiss, I rolled off, putting my back in the chair.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, Baby," she said, kissing me again. "I want you," she said as she pulled herself up to sit on top of me. "But first, I want you to fuck me, OK?"</p> <p>"OK," I replied as we took our clothes off, and I watched as her beautiful body came into view, as her pussy was parted for me. I could see her labia peeking out between her legs, and the tip of her clit. I took ahold of her labia, and pulled her, opening her, and gently entering her.</p> <p>I put one knee on the chair, and we kissed again, until she had me fully inside her, and began to move. The sensation of my cock moving in and out of her pussy with only her lips on top was wonderful, a pleasure I had never experienced before.</p> <p>I held her hips, and she began to move back and forth, taking me with her.</p> <p>I began to move faster and harder, reaching behind her to stroke her buttocks, her thighs and her pussy. She began to moan softly; she liked when I took control.</p> <p>"I love that," she said as her voice grew higher and higher, becoming a squeaky, squealing sound. "Oh, fuck, God, I love it. You feel good inside me. Fuck my pussy, fuck my pussy harder, fill me up. Oh, that's it, Baby, you make me feel good."</p> <p>Now my balls began to slap against her ass, and I could feel the rush of my cum. "Baby, I can't hold out much longer," I said between breaths. "Here, hold me with your arms and legs," I said. And I laid her on her back, and slid into her; sliding in and out gently at first, as soon as my cock began to come to full readiness again. Holding her hips with one hand, I continued to stroke her, until I was fully hard again, and she was starting to thrust back at me as I was fucking her.</p> <p>Then we fell into a rhythm, each sliding a little deeper into her. Our bodies moved together, our sounds of love, the friction of our bodies and the sounds of our orgasm's mixed.</p> <p>Then, when she became aware of our surroundings again, we stopped, and she opened her eyes and looked me in the eye, smiling and kissing me. Her lips were soft, and she'd moved her body towards me as her head tilted up. Soon, our faces were close, lips touching, tongues swirling, moaning, feeling each other.</p> <p>Tears flooded her eyes as she said, "Oh, yes, baby, I love you," and we kissed again.</p> <p>I felt her hand reach to my cock and find that it was as hard as when she'd pulled it earlier that day, which I could feel with her hand when we were masturbating together. She stroked it as she kissed my face and my mouth, and we embraced in a deep, intense kiss, both of us wanting more. My hands wandered to her ass cheeks; I could feel the warmth from them, as I pulled her even more tightly to me. When our lips parted, I kissed her eyelids as she whispered, "More," into my mouth.</p> <p>I eased back, and she wrapped her legs around my hips as we began toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
