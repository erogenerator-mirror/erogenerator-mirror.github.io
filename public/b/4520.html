I exclaimed.</p> <p>Kathleen reached under the shower curtain and grabbed the towel, and pulled me out.</p> <p>"Go, I'm going to scrub up!" she told me and proceeded to pull me in. As she scrubbed, I stood behind her, rubbing against her back.</p> <p>"No!" I protested as she pressed against me, not wanting our bodies to separate. "It's our night!"</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she said. It's only for the first round that I'll be sorry."</p> <p>I wasn't sure if you could make any difference to Kathleen in her time of transition, but I felt that she'd make a good candidate to take.</p> <p>"Come on," I said, taking her hand and leading her out to the showers.</p> <p>Kathleen had to stop and admire herself in the mirror. She was still in her bathing suit and was wearing a sheer black bra and matching panties. She'd taken the bra off; the dark circles in the cup were visible, and the hardening cocks in her panties had to be pointing in every direction in the mirror.</p> <p>She slipped on a pair of panties and stepped into the hot water.</p> <p>"You're going to have to get naked," I said. "I want to admire your breasts, just in case something else happens later."</p> <p>Kathleen did as I asked and slipped her panties off, her pussy glistening.</p> <p>"Not just to be sexy," I reminded her and leaned over to slide her panties down her legs and toss them aside.</p> <p>"You're going to see me naked; you're still a virgin," I said.</p> <p>Kathleen looked at me and laughed.</p> <p>"Are you kidding? I already did it!" she exclaimed. "Did it ever happen?"</p> <p>"It did," I replied. If she told me the wrong thing later, my dick would be hard like a rock and I'd have to do something. I was about to take out my cock when a hand grabbed my dick and pulled it upwards and slapped that hand away. "Get over here," I commanded to her. "Now," I told her as I pushed my head under the water and leaned over a body.</p> <p>"No, don't!" I said.</p> <p>"Yes, I'm sorry," she said, and grabbed my head. Soaping a pussy was still a good way to get myself hard. Not with my head between those smooth thighs, so I kept it down.</p> <p>"No, no, no..." I heard in her voice. "It's not a nice thing to do, but it's okay. It's the right thing for you."</p> <p>I felt Kathleen's tongue licking my balls and I was surprised.</p> <p>"Hey," she said. "If you start to feel that way, you don't want me to stop."</p> <p>"Kathleen, get your hand away from my dick and go back to what you were doing," I said as she turned that body around.</p> <p>My cock was standing straight out and throbbing. I reached for Kathleen's head, and pushed it down.</p> <p>"Lick my balls," I commanded.</p> <p>Kathleen happily took one into her mouth and sucked.</p> <p>"That's it," I said. "Move your tongue so you can taste the juice coming out in a steady stream."</p> <p>I heard Kathleen moan and felt a twinge in my balls.</p> <p>"I'm getting close" I heard her say. "What are you waiting for? Lick me a bit."</p> <p>I pulled her away but kept my hands there.</p> <p>"You want this to happen, don't you?"</p> <p>"No, I don't," Kathleen whispered in response to the taste of my pre-cum.</p> <p>"Tell you what," I said. "I want you to start to rub my cock as you lick it up and down and keep going up and down while you lick down under the hood to just under the rim of the knob and to lick the glans from where it's still hard. When you do it, do it for me – that's all you want?"</p> <p>"Yes," she said.</p> <p>"OK," I said. "Start licking me, just like you do every other part of my body."</p> <p>Kathleen was moving her tongue in a circular motion, slowly sliding it up and down my cock, taking a little bit deeper each time.</p> <p>"That's it; keep licking. Don't take off your tongue, just keep going on."</p> <p>Kathleen was doing exactly that and looked over at me. We were both looking at her pussy. It was swollen, lips puffy, her flesh flushed and glistening with juices. She held her fingers up in a tight circle and smiled up at me—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
