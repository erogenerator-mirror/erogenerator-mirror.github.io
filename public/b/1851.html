He said with a nod. "As you're all aware, I was not born for my life, in fact I'm no longer my mother. I'm, like me, just beginning. I'm eighteen now. I'll be graduating in a couple of years, and the first six will be free. The second will be in two weeks," he said, as he turned his head toward my parents, "I know for a fact, your father hasn't even been there yet, and my mother is more than done with her business. So, now I am eighteen. I'll begin my life. I have a choice; be with you or leave. It is simple for me. I could find happiness there, where I'm not, and go on as I am. It doesn't have to be with you. No, it doesn't have to be with my father, I would go anywhere on Earth, to find happiness in anything that's mine."</p> <p>My father spoke softly, as she continued, "But we have only just begin. This is the very beginning. You will not be disappointed. For now, we have to start the right way. The way you should be taken. You should be treated and you should have a choice. We have our own future, but not in the present. Now we have our first choice. We can go back to what we have been." He held his hand out to her, "My mother, you should let your own future choose this. If I choose to live here with you, I am here also. So, choose wisely. Don't turn this into my life. You don't need your father to choose you."</p> <p>Sara was staring at me, and looked at her mother as she took her father's hand and nodded. "It wasn't about me either," she whispered.</p> <p>"Yes," my father said, "but you will, when we're done with you."</p> <p>We all watched him as he walked with my mother into the back bedroom. I did not know what to make of him. He was one of those people who seemed to have a natural ability to see you for you, and he was one of those that had done something for you and wanted to show you what it felt like to be loved. He stood there in a pair of khaki pants and an old t-shirt, which he had thrown on the floor, followed by a pair of flip-flops. A pair of black hair-braids rested on top of a grayish-blue hair-dress that was finished off with a pair of plain white sneakers. To keep yourself safe, this man wore white socks and a pair of short-shorts.</p> <p>There were some things about my father that I did not quite grasp in my mind. He had a great sense of humor. He was very easygoing, and I always found myself in conversations with him. Sometimes I think, there was, or had been, a small part in that, in my relationship with my father, but he never really talked about it. I was afraid of the repercussions of his actions and I would try to not do that.</p> <p>After we made our way into the apartment, Sara turned and faced her mother. She reached out and grabbed her hand. She was surprised to see how long she stood there staring at me.</p> <p>"What is it?" she asked.</p> <p>"My father and I discussed this last night in front of her. He wants you to choose to live here with me."</p> <p>Sara's hand reached out toward me, then back up. "What do you want me to choose?" she asked.</p> <p>"I already mentioned the choice I made last night about being with you," I said, "But I wanted to give her something, to help her choose which one of you would be the one to take control of their lives."</p> <p>Sara's heart was racing. She looked at me with tears in her eyes, "And what was I going to do?"</p> <p>"You'll find out what you have to do, because I have no idea how you can make it happen." I told her, "My father thinks you're one smart looking woman. He thinks you might get pregnant. He's only got a couple of weeks to get you through the summer. He thinks we will be together."</p> <p>"He can't be serious." I said softly, "And I'm going to keep my word. Don't take any chances."</p> <p>"No, I won't," her voice said softly. She reached out to take my hand. "I'll try to be very careful." With that, she squeezed it, "Besides, I know you're not going to be happy to see me. I'll know if you need me."</p> <p>Sara stood there for a minute, still silentâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
