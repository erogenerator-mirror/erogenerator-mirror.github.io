"I told the cab driver I was going home. I was going to drop him off at his apartment, which he wouldn't be able to find."</p> <p>"Thanks. He probably wouldn't do anything you didn't want to see him do," said the other woman. She glanced toward Sara. "I know where he is."</p> <p>"I know," said Sara as she turned to face the tall woman. "I just didn't see any of my husband's business in it. I guess I'll have to pick up some things from my office or pick up my car. I'll be ready to go home if you like."</p> <p>"Actually I'm glad to see you. I was a bit worried about you, but I just can't explain to you how hard it is to meet each other's eyes when we're apart," said the woman. "A taxi is a lot safer than waiting for taxis back home. You know the police stop them when they're at a bad time."</p> <p>"Thank you for being so understanding. Did you want to drop me off?" asked Sara.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. That was a beautiful, expensive date. I can't say that I'm interested in you," said the woman after that.</p> <p>"I don't mind either. It really turns me on," said Sara in a small voice.</p> <p>The three women hugged and kissed. After that the three women made their way to the car. Both women had already learned to take their time. Each woman drove out of the parking lot and took the few blocks to a nearby hotel. When the car parked in the parking area the cab pulled up and began to take off. The women paid the driver and they took off.</p> <p>"It's been a beautiful date," Sara said, while her friend climbed inside.</p> <p>"Yes it has. And it was a great deal of fun. I think you should go home so we can get on with business before things get too complicated."</p> <p>They got out of the car. Sara got out and helped the woman climb into the passenger seat. The woman was a little taller than her friend. She was slim and attractive. Her skin was dark. She wore a knee-length, pleated skirt that stopped just below her butt, that revealed a lot of leg, even through the open neck of her blouse. Her top was unbuttoned enough that if she had taken her top off it would have revealed a large cleavage.</p> <p>The driver looked over Sara's shoulder at the woman whose name tag read, "Vicky. Please call me Vicky."</p> <p>"Thank you Vicky," said Sara.</p> <p>"The pleasure was all mine," said the woman.</p> <p>Sara looked at the woman's long, shapely legs. "And your husband's pleasure was all mine."</p> <p>They made their way out the door and to their respective vehicles.</p> <p>Sara opened the door for the woman who was obviously a professional with a reputation for being a good driver. "My name is Vicky," she said as she slid in the front seat.</p> <p>"Sara. I can't believe how nice your voice sounds. It's nice."</p> <p>She leaned toward Sara. "This is my husband."</p> <p>"Hello, Vicky," said Sara, as she reached to take Vicky into her arms. "I'm glad to have you by my side in the limo."</p> <p>The ride in the limo was not only uneventful, but it was also more intimate than Sara had expected. They made polite, polite conversation through several breaks; all of which became increasingly difficult to keep track of. The limo traveled for almost 1 hour until it stopped on a side road that appeared occupied. The driver got out and they went back to Vicky's car. They drove for another 40 or so minutes until the limo started moving.</p> <p>Vicky got out first. The lights in the limo flickered until they were at an intersection. Sara got out of Vicky's car too, and they made their way to Sara's.</p> <p>Sara's limo was very spacious. "This does have a king-sized bed in it," said Vicky while pointing to the bed. "If we don't mind." The driver got out of his car too and they got into Vicky's.</p> <p>Vicky looked around the area. There were only a few other cars at the hotel. She said, "This is a lovely city."</p> <p>"I do too," agreed Sara.</p> <p>"Would you care for some champagne?" Vicky asked.</p> <p>"No," said the tall woman, as she poured some champagne. "I'm married to one of the wealthiest men in the city."</p> <p>Sara said, "That's nice of you to say.
