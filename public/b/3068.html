I was about to get back at him for his foul behavior when his hand was behind me at first.</p> <p>"How far have you gone, son?" I said to him. "Do you want to know?"</p> <p>"Please, momma, what are you doing"</p> <p>"Just keep going." I said to him, putting him back on the road. At this point he was almost beyond comprehension. His hand grabbed me and squeezed my ass, which only made me moan and he fucked me again. I pulled away from him, looking at him and smiling. He just kept grinning like an idiot.</p> <p>"Momma, please. I'll be good," he said.</p> <p>"Ok. I'm so glad that you'll be. Besides, you can start now," I said. It made him grin big, and get off me with a grunt. He got on his knees, grabbed his crotch, and began to stroke himself. I had to hold my hand over mine for balance, but that didn't take long. Soon he was shooting his cum on his back and shoulder. I felt him shaking against me and a smile came across my face as he pulled out cum splattered over his chest.</p> <p>"Thank you," he said, sitting up.</p> <p>"Glad to be of service, young man," I said to him with my head bowed.</p> <p>"Thank you, momma," he said to me.</p> <p>"I'm sure that would be a pleasure, but you'll be sorry when you're gone," I said, with a giggle.</p> <p>He laughed at that. I thought what a nice boy he could be.</p> <p>We sat down and tried to get things back on. I wanted to say something, but was stumped, since he was looking forward to it too much. He had his head in his hands, so I decided to play it cool.</p> <p>"Mom, this has just gotten way out, you should go," I said to him.</p> <p>"No, no, that's alright, I'll be okay," he said.</p> <p>"Just go, please," I said to him, trying to convince him, I'm sure that it will be okay. I'll try to help him, I hope. I tried to give him a sexy, innocent smile.</p> <p>"That's ok, mom. I really needed that. It's nothing that you and I just had that went that far, and I'm not sorry. Thank you, son."</p> <p>"It's no problem, I'll stay until this thing goes away", he said to me.</p> <p>We both smiled at each other like newlyweds now.</p> <p>"Ok, it's time for me to go now," said I to him, hoping that this time we would make it through the remainder of things. I looked over at him and smiled.</p> <p>He just shook his head. We both laughed, hugged, and got up to go to bed. We went upstairs immediately after that, both going to the bathroom. He walked me a place, so I knew where he stopped to take a shower. My bathroom was not there, but I didn't mind the idea that I was just in the shower.</p> <p>I had washed the clothes that I had borrowed from his uncle's room, and decided to wear some shorts and a tighter top, which would really show a little bit of my cleavage. It was getting late, and I had to go to find him. I was hoping that he'd already gone out, so I was ready for the rest of my time at this partyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
