"You have a special brand. It's all you know!"</p> <p>"Well, it's really true!"</p> <p>She reached through the fabric and grabbed an ass cheek. "This might be the last time I model it."</p> <p>I looked around at the other people standing outside the bathroom. "Wow," I said. "It's really pretty."</p> <p>"You like it?"</p> <p>"Well, yes, and yes I do," I admitted.</p> <p>"If it's what you're looking for, I think that would be pretty fun," she said.</p> <p>"Wow!" I said again, not knowing what else to say.</p> <p>"How about our next stop? Where are we heading to?"</p> <p>"To a new place," I said. "What kind of place do you like?"</p> <p>"That I don't know," she said. "Well, it's not really a new place. It's sort of a hangout in the city."</p> <p>"Like what kind of place were you going to pick?" I asked.</p> <p>She giggled. "It's kind of obvious. I'll show you."</p> <p>We started our journey from the bathroom and into the main room where we were met by two people. After introductions had been made and introductions were made, a young man with a full head of dark brown hair said to us: "Hello, I'm Tom and this is my wife, Jill."</p> <p>We laughed together as they escorted us to our seats at the table.</p> <p>"Let's have a sip of water," I said, taking a sip. "Jill, if you were my wife, you could probably drink a lot more than me."</p> <p>"That's kind of silly of you," she laughed.</p> <p>"Just kidding. In fact," I said, "if you could give me a double shot of what it's like to drink a double shot of beer, I'd be a very, very happy guy," I finished my beer.</p> <p>"Well, maybe," she said. "Can I get one for myself?" she said as she stood up. She looked very happy, even though she knew that it wouldn't be very effective.</p> <p>"Don't you have a glass?" I asked.</p> <p>"I don't," she said, looking at me. "Just let me sip a bit, and let's get to that question though."</p> <p>"Sure," I said as I reached across the table and grabbed a glass of water for her.</p> <p>"Here is what we'll do, if you're willing," I said, setting my glass and the bottle on the table. "It'll take about fifty-five minutes. That way we can finish our drinks and get to our next meeting."</p> <p>"You know," I looked at her, "I know what I want. I'll give you half the price."</p> <p>"Yeah, but you can't spend forty five hundred dollars to get fifty times that," she laughed.</p> <p>"Hey, look, I'm not taking money," I said. "I want a nice little group piece of ass."</p> <p>"Hey!" she laughed. "I'm kidding," she said.</p> <p>"Well, actually, I want a nice little group piece of ass," I pointed out. "I want hot and heavy action in a room that's just so big. And a few women that are willing will want it with me."</p> <p>"You know where I go when I do that," she said. "I'll show you if we go there."</p> <p>"Yeah, okay," I said, grabbing the bag with the beer in it and leading her to the front door.</p> <p>She pulled up to the curb and we stepped out of the car. There is a large circular driveway that turns all the way towards the house. At the front gate, there is a huge old iron gate where it opened in the yard. I opened it and waved her closer.</p> <p>It took a minute for her to reach the front door. She looked at me and saw the door handle. I pulled her inside and closed and locked the door. I turned the main light on and walked back to her, pulled her back against the huge iron gate and took her in my arms.</p> <p>"I'm going to make you feel good, baby," I said. "I'll make you feel good so much better." I ran my hand through her hair, down to her waistline and back again, making love to her right there on the front door. When I ran my palm over her mound, over and over, sliding my fingers around her clitoris, she came within minutes.</p> <p>It was still only just after midnight when I returned to my own apartment. She gave me a smile.</p> <p>"Why don't we go out for a drink after work?" she askedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
