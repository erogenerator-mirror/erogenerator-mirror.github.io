"I had the meeting last night to review our investment plan."</p> <p>Mark nodded in agreement and followed his lover into the meeting room.</p> <p>"Let's just start with some basic details," he began.</p> <p>The man looked at the folder and scanned the pages while Mark started a detailed description of the new investment plan. He looked over at the man as he did the final analysis. "You have a very high profit margin," he said, "and we are now going to use the best part of his investment to make that happen."</p> <p>"That is why I was there," said Mark. "To have you present me with an idea for the new investment strategy and then put me into a position to use it to benefit myself."</p> <p>"Exactly, and as a bonus Mark that is why we came to you this morning. I am having a very hard time finding that financial advisor to review the investment plan."</p> <p>"How many people are making this investment now?" Mark asked.</p> <p>The man looked at him as he scanned the documents. "I have eight hundred thousand in the fund to buy out one of the largest accounts in the country for $10 billion."</p> <p>"I have another fifteen in that same amount."</p> <p>"I can't believe it," his lover added with a note of incredulity.</p> <p>"You are my money," he replied as he reached for her.</p> <p>"Then what did you do?"</p> <p>"It was easy to buy out a handful of the largest accounts."</p> <p>"And that is?"</p> <p>"And I am not giving that money away just in case it comes out the wrong way in the future."</p> <p>"You make the most of your money," Mark said with a smile. Then his eyes went back to the man. "Then I am going to make myself a very valuable asset."</p> <p>Kira had been nervous as Mark had to come up with a plan. They had talked about how valuable he was to them and she had felt it would benefit them as well.</p> <p>"Don't start jumping to conclusions just yet," his lover warned. "You are working out how we are going to make that investment. You have been planning it to a great extent and I don't want any doubts from you whether you made the investment and I am sure you did. Are you ready?"</p> <p>Kira could practically feel excited even though she knew this was going to be difficult. Mark was a brilliant negotiator and there was no one that could make his investment. She had been in the meeting every month for the last six weeks and she was not going to be disappointed.</p> <p>"I'm ready," she said.</p> <p>"Then where do we start?"</p> <p>As if in answer Mark reached for her hand and squeezed it. "Remember that investment strategy we talked about? You have always given me this opportunity to help you to better shape your future." He gave her a gentle squeeze.</p> <p>Kira wanted to protest. She always felt the same way when he was around. Even though she couldn't see the man behind it, she knew she wanted to take the risk.</p> <p>"I also don't want a problem that you are aware of," he responded. "If something happens that I can't explain, I have to do what's best for you and the people that I care about."</p> <p>"Just how far are you willing to go?" Mark asked with a confident smile.</p> <p>"This is all very new to me and I don't know how to go about it right now. For now, I just want to enjoy spending time with you." He held her hand in his and they left the meeting place and walked in silence to his SUV.</p> <p>They drove together for awhile holding hands and enjoying how free their arms felt with his hand on her leg. Then they got into the car. He put his arm around her back.</p> <p>"Are you ready to invest in that investment strategy?" he asked quietly.</p> <p>Kira just nodded and they headed for the restaurant. Mark sat in the front for a while telling her the investment strategies he had been working out on and what was expected of them in each one. Then he pulled out into traffic and sped off before he even pulled into the parking lot.</p> <p>Kira watched him drive away, as she could see he was thinking about what was coming next. When the traffic light turned green, he gave her a big smile.</p> <p>He held his hand outâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
