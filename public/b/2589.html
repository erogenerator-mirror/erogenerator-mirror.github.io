I told her.</p> <p>"Mmm, that sounds soo hot," she said.</p> <p>"But not right now. Right now I want you in bed with me." she said as she moved to me and sat down on the bed.</p> <p>"I know. So where do we fit into the game tonight?" I asked her.</p> <p>"I can't keep my hands of you. You can run me around all night if you want."</p> <p>"Mmm, I would love to run you around around," I said. She leaned close and kissed me softly, her lips pressing firmly against mine. "But you get first pick," I said as I pulled her on top of me.</p> <p>When we were kissing, her legs and mine pushed outwards and held me in a tight embrace.</p> <p>"I've been waiting for this for too long," we said huskily, and I began to run my hands all over her body. I pulled her top and bra up over her breasts and held them in my hands, squeezing them and tweaking her nipples. I pulled back her hand and kissed her softly, slowly licking and biting her lower lip as my hands continued to run all over her body.</p> <p>"You feel so good and sexy in my arms," I breathed into her ear.</p> <p>"I missed you," she said just before we finally broke our kiss; just a little before we were both panting a little. I pushed her back at the edge of the bed, lifted her legs over my shoulders and lowered my cock slowly inside of her. As it slid into her, I could feel the softness of her softness and her warmth. We both made sounds that were muffled and breathy, but we still kissed passionately. Our moans could be heard throughout the bedroom.</p> <p>We continued, each one of us breathing deeply. I ran my hands all along the inside of her legs, and we held each other close. Every now and then, as my breath got shallower, I would kiss her gently before moving my lips to her cheek and chin. I kissed her forehead. She rested her head on mine, and ran her fingers through my chest hair.</p> <p>"Shit. You're good at this," I moaned.</p> <p>"You aren't the only one. Just wait until you see how hot I am."</p> <p>I broke the embrace and lay down on the bed, pulling her with me. We lay there, kissing, touching, caressing each other deeply. I pulled her into me as we lay on the bed again, kissing the way that had started this, holding each other close, kissing each other passionately.</p> <p>"I'm not going to last long, and I'm sure there is room for two more soon." she said and kissed me again.</p> <p>"I know," I said "I don't have much time left so I'm just going to be a little selfish. But you do this with people you like. And I'm all yours, if you want to have me."</p> <p>She kissed me a last time as I pulled her closer to me. I felt her heart pounding rapidly, and I could feel her breasts pressing against me. I pushed my thigh firmly up against hers, grinding it hard against her pussy. I broke the kiss and got up on my knees, sliding my fingers along the edge of her shirt. I ripped her shirt open and pushed it off. I leaned forward and kissed her on the stomach. With every kiss, her stomach would move in perfect harmony with the rising beat of her heart.</p> <p>I moved down slowly, kissing, and licking along her belly. I was in heaven as I got closer to her soft, but now rock hard nipples. I kissed first one and then the other nipple, then my mouth slowly moved to her neck, where I began to suck on it as my hands roamed all over her. My hands made their way to the back of her head and as I did, she reached out her hands to hold my head as I kissed lower. As I moved lower, the lips of her pussy moved in perfect counter rhythm to my tongue.</p> <p>I moved my mouth lower, slowly running my mouth along her belly again. I could tell she was a little disappointed but she moaned loudly as I licked slowly around her naval. When I got close, I slipped my tongue as hard and as fast as I could while running it around the edges of her pussy. When my tongue slipped up to her clit, she jumped and moaned hard. I repeated this several times, circling her clit with my tongue at the bottom. After each pass, I would take her clit into my mouth and suck on it. I could feel the lips of her pussy pressing against my tongue. I kept this up for a whileâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
