You're not going to get any answers at all until you can answer all of my questions."</p> <p>"I can't answer any questions you can answer, you're just going to have to accept it." She said, looking up at me.</p> <p>"No." I said, pulling up to a stop. "You're not going to like this. You might not tell me everything."</p> <p>"Can I take a chance now on the one thing." She said slowly turning around in her seat.</p> <p>"I've got to know what you are feeling right now."</p> <p>"I've never said it." She paused.</p> <p>"It's ok, I told you." I said softly. "It will only be a once with what happened today."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I'm not sure." She said a little hesitatingly.</p> <p>"It is ok." I said with a smile and got out of my car.</p> <p>I was ready to call it a day, but this wasn't my idea, at least not yet, and if it did happen we were going to deal with it, so I thought. I knew it was a long shot.</p> <p>I got to my parents' and told them we were headed for a restaurant and the driver was just leaving. They said something about "they're going to give us our meals here." I told them they could take my car and we'd see what they decide.</p> <p>The drive to the restaurant took a little over an hour, not a short amount at all. We were a little surprised at the food itself, and the place was already full when we got there. My father gave me a nice hug to thank me for driving all the way to see them today. While that greeting was going on my mother leaned over and gave me a hard kiss on the cheek as we had done before.</p> <p>"I'm sorry to get you all nervous, Mr. B., but you have to wait until we get to the restaurant. Don't leave anything out that would explain why we're going to be here." She said.</p> <p>"You should know that by now." I said. "I've never been to the restaurant before. I know it's a little short, but I figure it's pretty good. I'll make sure it's all set up before we go."</p> <p>"You don't have to wait." My father pulled away from the curb. "You see how the restaurant is set up, I mean, for this to work. You're going to eat with us and when you get there you're going to enjoy yourself very much."</p> <p>"Dad, you're not talking about the food. You're talking about what you have to do in order to help get us all here." My mother said, hugging me in the car.</p> <p>"What about me, huh?" I asked. "What about me?"</p> <p>"We're not going to have to wait and see what happens, Mr. B." My mom said. "We're going to get you started because there is something you have to do."</p> <p>"It's not going to be all that simple." I said quietly. "I'm almost done here." I turned and started to back off the curb. "I'll be right in and you're going to eat."</p> <p>"We're not going to be waiting for your dinner." My mother said, turning around and walking into the restaurant. As soon as she was inside the door she picked up her bag and walked right into one of the men in their early sixties.</p> <p>"You're not going to eat with us today." My mother reminded me, making no effort to hide her disappointment.</p> <p>"Why not?" I asked. "You'll have a chance to eat in here and we can go all the way."</p> <p>"What do you mean by that?" My mother looked at me, unsure of what to make of it.</p> <p>He was about thirty, brown hair and eyes, but not as big as my father's. He looked well-kept, dressed and obviously had money.</p> <p>"Well, we're going to leave you something to help you eat, a bag of chips, soda, juice." My mother continued talking to his father. "I know we have to have something here, but I don't know where it will go to."</p> <p>"You have the right, Mrs. B." His father said. "If you want me to help you choose what food you want, then we'll let you."</p> <p>My mother looked at him and finally turned around to leave.</p> <p>"Let's have a little fun first." She said, turning around and putting the last plate of food in the bag.
