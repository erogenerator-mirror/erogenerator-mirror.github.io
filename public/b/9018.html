You're very pretty."</p> <p>"Oh," she replied. "And you're too sweet for my sweet." As she said that she started fondling my balls as if to gauge my cock's stiffness.</p> <p>"Let me put this back, please?"</p> <p>"Of course," she whispered as she opened the box of condoms and held it out between the two of us.</p> <p>She took the latex packet and started with one, but with the one just in front of her eyes, turned it on, and took it back with the second condom she took off, placing it on and around my cock from behind. She pulled me up to her and we kissed deeply.</p> <p>"Let's go into the bedroom," she asked.</p> <p>I took her by the hand and led the way. I pushed her onto the bed so she was on her back. She spread her legs and I lowered my head, placing the head of my cock against the lips I had just penetrated and then thrust my hips up, forcing my way inside. Again we kissed as I began to pump harder and faster. She looked up into my eyes the whole time. Her breathing increased and her movements became increasingly erratic.</p> <p>I kept at her for about a minute, her legs wrapping around my body as I could feel the muscles down there working the head of my cock. I couldn't believe how she had kept it up for so long with me fucking the hell out of her. She started to tense again and I decided it was time to get me some relief. Just as suddenly, I gave her a firm smack on her ass.</p> <p>"Hahaha,"</p> <p>"Sorry," I said sheepishly.</p> <p>I pulled out and she sat back and watched as I removed the condom and tossed it on the floor, with the one from the night before sitting beside me, still hard. She took it from me and put it on and I got on top of her, my cock pushing against her opening.</p> <p>"I'd say, you should have your back turned to me," she said laughing and I grabbed a towel and wiped her, then pulled her down onto all fours.</p> <p>"You'll have to do it with your mouth, so that you can clean up after your first fuck," I said.</p> <p>She looked up at me as I knelt over her head, with my face just inches from her pussy. I took my tongue and flicked against it, then placed it against her entrance, parting her lips slowly, then slowly pushing my tongue inside.</p> <p>"Yeah," she sighed. I continued to stroke her clit, running my tongue up and down the inside of her pussy. This elicited another sigh from her and continued until I could tell she was about to orgasm, so I took another taste of her.</p> <p>"Oooh, oh, OOOOHHHHHH!" She cried, as the first surge was released as she reached the top of her orgasm. As the final wave passed through her, she lifted her head and looked me in the eyes.</p> <p>"You taste so good, Michael," she laughed.</p> <p>"I love you, Jennifer. I just want to keep your legs spread wide so that you can touch me, to feel my cock. Any way you'd like that please." She reached up and pulled my face toward hers and we kissed hard. I continued to rub my tongue against hers, trying to keep my own taste and feel from her. She broke the kiss and looked me in the eye for the first time as she reached down toward the bed.</p> <p>"No. Get down here, on your knees. I want to fuck you."</p> <p>I got back on my knees, then got between her legs, putting my hands behind her knees at her shoulders.</p> <p>"Take me in your mouth," I said. "Let me watch you lick me, until I'm fucking your face."</p> <p>She took just a little over a second before taking me in her mouth again, and this time she started to work her mouth up and down my shaft. This went on for several more minutes, until I couldn't stand it anymore and pulled out of her.</p> <p>"You want to come up here and lie down?"</p> <p>"Well yeah," she gasped. "But we have to start right away, if we're gonna get any more fucking today."</p> <p>I got back near her head and started the shower. I had just stepped in when we both heard a splashing sound.</p> <p>"It's been a while," whispered Ellen.</p> <p>"Yeah. I know," I said as I looked down at her naked body, her large breasts still very perky. "What'd you think of the night's activities?"</p> <p>"Pretty nice," she said.
