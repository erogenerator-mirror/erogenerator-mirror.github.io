Let's go eat."</p> <p>"I don't want to go." He said quickly, his hand covering the screen and shaking slightly.</p> <p>"Then don't go."</p> <p>"I think I can do that."</p> <p>The woman's voice caught his attention, but didn't scare him. "You think so?"</p> <p>"I..." he said, not quite knowing who was asking what. "It's what a couple might want. You know. You've got another job. You can get a job and start another business."</p> <p>"I did not!" The voice said.</p> <p>"But you know I love you," the voice said. "You've earned it."</p> <p>The woman was silent for a moment, as her eyes went cold. The shock of the news caught him by surprise and he turned slowly toward her. "You'll always be my woman."</p> <p>"I may never be your woman," she said. "I want it but I will be no longer there anymore."</p> <p>A moment passed where she spoke again, her eyes hard and cold. "I don't know what it is, but I'll never be your woman."</p> <p>"Are you going to divorce yourself?" he asked, finally knowing the answer. "After everything I've done?"</p> <p>"Don't be foolish," she said, and stepped closer to him. "I'll work for it. You can come back to me. I can make you happy."</p> <p>The woman's voice seemed distant, and he didn't know what to say.</p> <p>The man's arms came up around her and he pulled her tight against him, forcing her to lean back with her head against the wall and put her upper body against the wall with her legs. His arms were pressed against her skin as he ground his semi-hard cock against her. With his hands he was kneading her breasts through her blouse and bra with an intensity he'd felt just minutes before. He liked the way they looked in that position. They were heavy but firm and aching.</p> <p>She had a hold of the shirt she'd been wearing and was undressing him.</p> <p>"But I can't. You know I can't."</p> <p>She dropped to her knees on the floor, and pulled the shirt up and off. Her eyes never left his as she pushed his pants to the ground and sat looking up at him. His erection was throbbing against his thigh and her hand reached out and wrapped around it, squeezing it firmly.</p> <p>In a minute or so, his legs went weak and with it a shock of a feeling. He felt her breasts press against him and she was looking up at him, but her eyes were fixated upon his erection.</p> <p>The feeling of her hand against him was unexpected, but the feeling came quickly and with a jolt, he felt her lips touch his, softly. Her tongue slipped between his lips, and against them, he felt his body jump. She kissed him and then moved her mouth down onto his cock.</p> <p>"Oh, Sam," she said as her tongue touched the head of his cock. "I'm sorry."</p> <p>"Just stop for a minute," he said to her. "I've got work to do."</p> <p>"You have to leave now," she said, still looking up at him.</p> <p>"Not without my help. And you'll be back!"</p> <p>"You know it's true."</p> <p>She smiled and stood, pulling her clothes back on.</p> <p>"Take care of yourself," he whispered. "I'll be back soon. I'm sure you'll come back."</p> <p>A moment passed of silence, of the two of them standing.</p> <p>"I'll take care of you," she said, and turned away. Sam watched as she stepped out of the elevator and he watched her ass as she went into the bank next door. He heard her call as she passed his door, and then turned towards the building.</p> <p>Her lips locked against his once more, their tongues sliding against the other's for a long moment.</p> <p>"You're a good kisser honey," she whispered into his ear as his hand slid up her naked thigh and squeezed a breast.</p> <p>She broke away from him a little, and stepped closer to him. "I'm going to get going," she said, and walked away.</p> <p>She left the elevator just as he heard the door open. His hand dropped to his side as he walked down the hallway and into his own building.</p> <p>He made it to his office, and there she was, in the office, still on her cell phone and talking with someone. His mind wandered back to his fantasy of hers for a fleeting moment.</p> <p>The thought never left his mind as he set up a desk to take a few documents to the printer. He set up his computer and went off into the other room, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
