She didn't say a word, just watched as her uncle stood in front of her completely nude. He looked incredible, with only the tiniest hint of pubic hair to prove his young age. He reached down to stroke his stiffening cock from base to tip.</p> <p>I could feel my arousal growing. I'd never been with anyone other than my dad before and I was nervous about it and how I was going to react.</p> <p>"Hannah."</p> <p>"Yes, Sir?"</p> <p>"Go to the bathroom and take your clothes off. I want to see your tits."</p> <p>Hannah quickly returned to the bedroom looking nervous and excited. As she walked down the hall, I made a point of looking down her robe to her exposed legs and ass cheeks.</p> <p>I could see she was going to be disappointed if she didn't come back. And she sure didn't need any foreplay at all to make me cum.</p> <p>Hannah disappeared into the bathroom, turned on the shower to run it, flushed the toilet, and grabbed a big fluffy towel of her own. From the look on Hannah's face I knew she'd be a bit embarrassed.</p> <p>She returned with a robe on a whim to slip on, although I'd made it obvious that I'd seen her fully nude before.</p> <p>"I'm going to take a shower, you clean your skin up and get ready in the bedroom," she said as she disappeared for about fifteen seconds when she reappeared.</p> <p>She took the towel off, and stepped into the shower once the water stopped. She looked in the mirror, looking so hot, so sexy and so sexy. The thought that I was looking at her naked body so intensely was very arousing.</p> <p>I don't quite know if Hannah liked the attention but if she did, she was obviously enjoying it. I'd already noticed how she had been looking her uncle and dad's bodies over the past several days. I mean really looking.</p> <p>"Okay, Hannah." I told her to wait in the shower for a few moments while I changed out of my clothes while she went into the bedroom.</p> <p>Once she was gone, I took my time, taking only a second to strip off the clothes that I wore to the shower.</p> <p>I turned and looked at this beautiful young woman standing in front of me, all self-conscious, still feeling self-conscious about the fact that she was still fully exposed, yet completely sexy. I wanted her to see what she'd been doing with her body.</p> <p>I don't know what made me say these words and how can you say those, and so you can imagine the way I felt seeing this young woman standing in front of my naked body.</p> <p>And she was still staring at me.</p> <p>I turned, looked up at her, and asked, "You are not a virgin?"</p> <p>"I don't think that I am, Sir." Hannah was so pretty that I thought I'd be able to hypnotize her again right there in the shower, taking her to the highest heights of erotic pleasure, but I wasn't. I had no idea how to hypnotize her. I just saw her eyes and her body language and it took all of an indeterminate time for me to get that hypnotic reaction in my gut feeling that I was hypnotizing her.</p> <p>"Hannah, you are here because I want you to get comfortable. You are beautiful, in spite of yourself. I'd like to see what I've made you feel."</p> <p>I'd been hoping that I could get this reaction again; it seemed to be working, even though it wasn't.</p> <p>"I don't want to be the only one of you to get hypnotized, Sir."</p> <p>"Hannah, I am your teacher."</p> <p>"I want you to be safe with me, Sir. And I want it to be safe where I belong."</p> <p>Hannah looked up at me with eyes that had tears in the corners. "I'm not afraid, either. I really want this as soon as I can get you out of your house and back in your bed, so I can do a good job and let you know you're safe and sound."</p> <p>"All this talk about getting me out of your house has given me a hard-on but I want you. I've wanted you for months, Hannah."</p> <p>"I've been waiting for you for awhile and, if it weren't for you, I'd have never done anything."</p> <p>"Hannah, really. I'm not going to hurt you." That was as close as our relationship had been going.
