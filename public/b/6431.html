My friend's face tightened and he let out a loud gasp, and he let out a cry in pain as my friend exploded in him</p> <p>'That's it, just like that. He's cumming' my friend screamed, his body quivering as he was totally released, his dick pumping cum onto my friend's stomach and chest as I watched him. As my friend's body shook and spasmed under the assault I felt my friend's dick cumming, I watched it as it continued to shoot out load after load of cum onto his stomach.

I grabbed his dick, still spurting out load after load of warm semen onto my friend's back and chest as I thrust my dick forward and began to cum as well.</p> <p>I pulled out my friend and I lay down next to him next to him, kissing him, and then kissing him more passionately as it just felt natural to be with him in fact. I rolled off of my friend and took an inordinate amount of time to kiss him again before getting up and pulling the blankets up over us both. I turned off the lights and I fell asleep there.</p> <p>When I awoke again it was 3 in the morning, my friends room was quite dark, I was surprised as I never thought of that side of the bed.

I went to the refrigerator, and took a cold mug out of the cupboard, I poured myself a cup, and sat down at the table. I turned on the coffee maker, the first thought I had was of going to sleep.
