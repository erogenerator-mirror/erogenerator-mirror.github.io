So what if she did not want to go to Europe. She did. He liked the idea of her being alone. He enjoyed their time together. He never imagined he would feel this way with her just because the situation did not apply to him. He thought of her as his lover and her as their son. And no, he was not his lover. As a result he was now the most beautiful, wonderful, and devoted man in the world.</p> <p>It was Friday night and she had gone on her run and he was sitting on the porch watching the sun come up. For the first time in over six years he was in no rush to get home. He was just enjoying himself and when she returned home to check on her. He thought of her lying naked in bed and he felt so good. She never complained. He wondered exactly what her body looked like without any clothes; and he felt his heart skip a beat. He wondered if she was awake.</p> <p>He was feeling better. His heart beat was starting to beat more slowly.</p> <p>She entered the house, and she turned out to be very pretty. And sexy. She was definitely wearing a nice blouse. She made sure the skirt was slit enough to get her hand in. He felt like he could see the swell of her leg up to her hip. She wore a pair of short shorts; and a halter-top. They hugged her figure wonderfully.</p> <p>He walked to the porch, feeling a tingle between his legs. He knew she was aware that he saw her. He looked over at her and he thought his heart stopped. For once she did not turn onto all fours so he could get a good look before she made herself comfy on the love seat. She had a beautiful bottom with a perfectly smooth and tight skin. He wanted to give her something that he would always remember; but he also wanted something a little different. He was not sure what his preference was and he would never ask her again.</p> <p>As she sat on the love seat, her clothes were a little baggy and her breasts were a bit more firm than she thought. Her top was too low. And it ended, well almost completely, at her crotch. It was a bit of a disappointment because he saw his mother's left nipple through the thin material that covered her. As he watched the movement of her breasts he could see the dark brown areolas of her firm globes. Her nipples were about a half inch or two. Her areolas were dark brown which accented her large nipples. He was not sure of the best way to put it, but that it was just as good of a statement as being described in any piece of book. But, he knew she had a beautiful mother. He wondered if she would like it too. He would have to try. He hoped it could be done.</p> <p>He did not want to do anything that could change her feelings about him. But, if there was anything going on it did not seem out of left field. Not only that, it was a small part of the reason he wanted to do things with her. She was a beautiful woman, and just looking at her made his heart flutter. He was attracted to her so much that he could not have ever asked her out.</p> <p>He walked over to her and he sat down on the love seat next to her. He was looking at her very intently. The way her hair framed her face. The way the top of her breasts flattened against her ribcage. He watched the slight crease of her lower belly, which was smooth as silk under the loose flannel of her panties. The slight movement from her left leg as she reached for something to put on.</p> <p>He felt as though he was in a trance thinking about what he wanted to do. He could not move; but that did not mean he was not attracted to her too. He was attracted to her and that was ok with him. And no it didn't mean he was not attracted to anyone, but to himself. But he couldn't think of anyone, and none of that was something to be afraid to say about her. Not to anyone, no one.</p> <p>They sat in silence for a while. He could feel her legs moving back and forth under his and it was making his manhood stiff. He wanted her to let him feel his hand move up and down so he could masturbate thinking about her. He wanted to touch her pussy, to smell her scent under the strong aroma of her panties and make love to her. This was his last chance. He just had to do this. He wanted to feel her in his hand. So he leaned his hands forward. He slid them under the bottom of her shirt. His fingers gently touched her nipple and he was aware of how he had touched her nipple under a blouse. He knew the nipple would be very hard and that it would beâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
