His hand, however, was busy. And when his head finally came out to face me, I swear he looked at me as if his entire body was on fire, which it must have been, for the first time ever.</p> <p>It was then that I realized how handsome he really was. The black hair framed his face so well and, like so many women, I had trouble remembering his face. I mean, it could be that he had the best looking teeth there was, but it could also be that his eyes were green and deep like a snake's. Not that you could tell from his eyes that he shaved. It was just that his eyes were so dark when they were looking at me that I was not imagining that I was seeing a dark forest of silver. All those muscles and veins all across his face and it's not like he was just a muscle bound guy who was not really interested in sports. I knew that this was part of him's attraction, but his eyes told a different story.</p> <p>I was pretty sure that I could guess at some sort of a physical chemistry that he had with me. He was a beautiful young man and he didn't really seem to have much of any social life. But, that just so happened to be all along. His family moved to a new city for work in Chicago and the time difference meant that my dad always worked long hours and he usually stopped by my mom's and their son's place after work so that I didn't have to leave town after school.</p> <p>He pulled himself out from between my legs so he could use his tongue again. I still couldn't quite believe that I was actually going to let him do me, to the point where if he wanted he could fuck me all night long if he wanted if he wanted.</p> <p>He licked, kissed and suckled all along my entire body for just an hour, with this new feeling he had I could tell that I didn't want to get down to anything until he gave me a chance. I could even have given him everything that I had ever wanted.</p> <p>We must have been doing this for hours, but with the exception of the time when his mouth got to my vagina, no one had ever touched me there.</p> <p>His tongue probed me all along the length of my womanhood where he would have thought the hair down there was. He kissed my clitoris, which seemed to drive me mad for it was all I could do to stay on my feet. He kissed down my labia, then back up to my mouth where he kissed each and every inch of my naked flesh. He began nibbling and sucking my labia and nipples as he would have done years ago at a wedding or a Christmas reception.</p> <p>It was the first time any of my husband's men had ever been inside me. I've never been with another man. I really didn't want to. I never was sure about anything else, but I just felt too ashamed as a young woman to let some guy do that for me. I did my husband a lot of good for not letting anyone else get close to me and to him a husband who would fuck what he had for you never would. I had to admit that it was kind of exciting, even though his face and hands were doing that incredible things to me, but it was all just too much for me. And it's not like a woman would let someone else do it for her. It was just that I couldn't get close enough for him. And I wanted to give him everything he could give me, including that big cock that filled me perfectly.</p> <p>All the years of my husband and I getting intimate with each other after our marriages couldn't happen without the other's permission. This was, of course, a huge part of what I wanted. A big part that I did everything I could even for my own happiness not to let something like this happen to me. The fact that I was giving myself so completely to someone so young and inexperienced, just added to the excitement of having a married man licking my vagina and putting his tongue inside me. The thrill of having a handsome man licking my pussy and then sticking his penis inside me was the thrill of the unknown. How would I ever get my hands on this beautiful penis he was getting to put inside me? How would I ever see it? I couldn't even imagine how I could fit it in my pussy. And what if it got to the balls. I was sure that this huge cock would be just the tip. I could probably squeeze it and make it my own private tool and I don't know when it would come out looking more like an angry red balloon, but whatever it was, I would certainly be jealous. Maybe even hurt.</p> <p>As he continued to lick me in almost every hole he touched, he inserted two fingers in me asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
