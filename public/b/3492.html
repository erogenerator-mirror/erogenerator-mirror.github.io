I kept seeing him, and I was so excited. On Sunday, I did a little shopping and got everything I needed for dinner and dancing, while he watched TV, and when the doorbell rang. We both took our time and greeted each other. I took one look at him and knew exactly what I was going to do, and he was ready. We went to the car and got in. We were quiet for a little while, all the time looking at each other. We just sat in front of the window, enjoying the moment and when I was almost done, he placed his hand over mine and said,</p> <p>"Wait." And said aloud, no words of what we were thinking, and that silence is our best mode of communication. He knew what we were thinking, and that was enough for me to get a little excited.</p> <p>He slowly touched my hand, and asked, "Don't be embarrassed, it's okay to let go. This is our first time together. Besides, I'm not a drunk driver. The wine probably made me, and I won't be."</p> <p>I moved my hand over and started putting my finger tips under his chin, and gently kissing him and then I held him.</p> <p>He gently pulled me towards him and he lifted me up so I could go all the way. I put my tongue in his mouth and felt his body stiffen as he took the initiative. He grabbed my ass and pulled me around the car and put his arm around me. We came up and he was now holding on to my breast roughly, his other hand was rubbing up and down my back and under my dress. His other hand was holding my leg and pulling on the hem of my dress, pulling it up till his whole hand was on my bare thigh. He stopped all the way, and my pussy was being pulled towards his hand.</p> <p>"This is so exciting." He was almost yelling with his mouth next to my ear.</p> <p>"You're so soft and gentle, I'm in a dream now. You will have your hands on my body forever, and you know that I love it." And I was feeling it and he was doing it too.</p> <p>And he knew how horny I was and how I was ready to be touched and kissed. I was moving my hands, pulling on his long hair and moaning as he was rubbing my thigh. His hand was moving between my leg, under the dress till it touched my pussy. I moved my hand and started to stroke him.</p> <p>I felt his hard body, the heat and hardness. I had never been with one like this before so I just had to touch and taste them. I started rubbing his dick and he was so excited in the room. He was now pulling my breast, my hand that was on his dick. His mouth started sucking and biting my nipple hard. It felt so damn good. He pushed 2 fingers into my vagina and was stroking inside of me. He was like a wild animal. His finger fucking was making me come again.</p> <p>"Are you ready to fuck me now, lover? I want to take you to bed in the car. I want to fuck you on the back seat and then, later we can go to my place for more."</p> <p>I didn't need to answer him, his finger was moving in and out of me faster and my moans coming faster. My finger moving in and out faster. His dick was in my hand, and I was stroking it as he kissed my lips.</p> <p>I couldn't have lasted any longer and felt that I was close and he was fingering me as I was squeezing him. I felt it coming and squeezed him as well as I could. The hot spurts inside my vagina exploded and hit me, I was going for a wild ride and then he was kissing me, pushing and pushing his tongue in my mouth. My lips and tongue being kissed. I couldn't move a muscle because suddenly, my hand was getting numb but he just kissed me long and whispered,</p> <p>"I love you, do you remember? You gave yourself to me in such a way that I want our first time to be so passionate and loving. Do you remember what I had to tell you?"</p> <p>"Yes... Yes.. God.... I love you. Now I want to be with you every day, just you know that I love you very much. Oh wait, there is something wrong with me again. Your clothes can go in the corner. I'm not sure if this will work. Come and put your clothes on, please. And if not, come on, we'll go to my place."</p> <p>With that, he turned around and started putting on my clothes. And when I saw his pants, he looked down and saw that his dick was already hard in his pants. Suddenly, I felt the urge to kiss him again but there would be too many inhibitionsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
