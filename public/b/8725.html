But, just stay right here..."</p> <p>Nathan, putting his hand back on my cock and I felt his warm mouth begin to lick it, slowly, lovingly.</p> <p>"Don't stop." Nathan spoke.</p> <p>Nathan, turning me around, "Just stand on the ledge up here, there is a little bit of your dress that has fallen out here on the ground."</p> <p>Nathan then stepped out of his suit, "We will be done here."</p> <p>Nathan, looking around himself, "Do you see the lights on?"</p> <p>"Yes. Why?"</p> <p>"Because you are going to be working on my cock."</p> <p>"Mmmm...I am sure that is part of what is now happening."</p> <p>"Nathan, no, we shouldn't be doing this."</p> <p>"Nathan" Nathan, removing his hand from my cock.</p> <p>"I know. But, I need you to do it for me...for me."</p> <p>Nathan stood before me. He did this with many thoughts running through my head, 'but this is wrong' 'don't act like you are enjoying this....' 'Just let yourself enjoy it and I will think about all the ways that this woman can pleasure you'.</p> <p>Nathan's hand rose to his waist, "Nathan. I can't do this...please don't!"</p> <p>"Come closer...," Nathan said as he then began to slowly walk away from me.</p> <p>Nathan, looking at me, "Natalie, just do as you're told."</p> <p>After a couple of steps, "Nathan. Please."</p> <p>Nathan, taking one last look around, "Just watch the lights."</p> <p>I watched as the lights were slowly being lowered and Nathan walked behind me, taking my arms from behind my back, and placing them on top of the dress where Nathan had put it. It felt to be in perfect control of a naked body and I felt Nathan's hands reach up and take my hands, pulling them out from behind as he slowly slid the dress down around my waist.</p> <p>"Nathan. Please."</p> <p>"No. You can't do this."</p> <p>"Nathan..."</p> <p>"It's hard for me to do this"</p> <p>Nathan, not wasting any time sliding his arms around my body, "It's ok."</p> <p>Nathan, slipping his hands all the way around my body, I had to stop from moving. Nathan placed his mouth on my neck, and then softly kissed it. After several moments, Nathan took off my shirt and began to lightly touch my back with both hands, making my cock spring to life and as Nathans hands began to move down, I could feel his hands rubbing against my back. My cock began to swell inside of Nathan's hands.</p> <p>Nathan, taking his hands off of me, I was getting embarrassed but I knew that I have never had Nathans hands on me before. "Nathan. Please. I don't want this..."</p> <p>"It's ok Natalie." I said as he helped me down off the ground, "I don't mind. I really do."</p> <p>Nathan, taking a step back, looking at me, "I want to...you know."</p> <p>"I've never felt this way about anyone before."</p> <p>Nathan, once he had me turned around, bent my back against the wall. Holding my hands straight, he bent and lifted my hands up behind my chest. Nathan placed my hands on my tits, and slowly kneaded them as he whispered against my ear, "This is going to be a lot like the time that I took care of you."</p> <p>Hearing Nathan say this, made me feel like I could only nod. Nathan began to kiss my neck, lightly tracing his tongue as it slid across my hairline. Nathan, placing some of Nat's shampoo into his hands and rubbing it on Nathan's hands, I let out a low moan, "Ohhhhhhh, mmmmhhhh..."</p> <p>Nathan, smiling up at me as he continued to massage my back, "Don't move Nathan. Just let my hands work their magic on you."</p> <p>Nathan continued to kiss his way down my back, placing his hands just above my lower back and slowly, very slowly, slipped down my body to my ass. Nathan's hands continued to softly rub my bare ass as he took his hands off of my ass, "Nathan, we can't."</p> <p>"Nathan" Nathan, placing his hands on my sides, "I don't want to."</p> <p>"Just relax for meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
