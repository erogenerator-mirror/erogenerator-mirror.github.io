I love being with you... but if I'm not in the mood then you should probably stop."</p> <p>She felt him tremble with that last sentence, as he slid his hands down behind her, his fingers tangling into her hair. She could feel his hands trembling against her scalp. He was practically shaking. Without breaking contact between them, he leaned forward to kiss her.</p> <p>She felt the rush of his mouth against her lips, her body shuddered from the heat of that kiss, and she was sure he felt her body shiver, but he had taken his lips from hers. She couldn't believe he wanted her so bad.</p> <p>"Now, it's my turn." He said with a grin. "Get on your knees," he said as he stood up. She was standing on her knees in the middle of his bedroom when he took his cock in his hand and stroked it up and down in front of her. She felt her whole body quiver from the pleasure. She could feel how turned on she was being, as he was, and she wanted to just get on her knees right now. She had no choice though, and she wanted him to know it. She moved to kneel in front of him, and he grabbed a fistful of her hair as he pushed himself forward.</p> <p>"Please, baby," he said, his voice rough, "just... just... please fuck me."</p> <p>That did it. He was on fire. She knew how badly he wanted her. But, now, it was time. He pulled her onto her knees in the middle of his bed. He threw his head back, and looked down at her. Her eyes were glazed with desire and pleasure. He reached out for her, his fingers trailing over her face, then down her neck, and her shoulders. Slowly his fingers went lower, over her breasts until they made their way over her stomach, then back to her hips. He felt the warmth on them all the way through her dress, down her thigh... down her leg to the very tips of her thighs. She wanted him so badly. He slid one finger across her mound, then let it trail from her bottom lip to her sex. She shivered and her mouth opened for air. She didn't realize he had stopped, but at that moment she felt so connected to him at that moment.</p> <p>She felt his heat through her dress, and knew in that moment she would be the center of his world. The heat from his body, the desire, the need, the feeling it had. She felt as if she and him were one. But, she couldn't move. She needed him and not just for him, but for herself she wanted him. He was so strong. She wanted him to be her life.</p> <p>She looked him right in the eye. "Please," she said in a whispered, "fuck me."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" She heard her heart beating hard in her ears. They had a brief moment in her mind to try asking him to do something about his hard cock. It was hard and curved up and out of his pants, but she knew she should make him wait before taking him.</p> <p>"Oh please." Her words were barely audible, and his eyes were fixed on her. She felt his eyes on her, but she also felt his fingers brushing her hair away from her face, so he could see her face. She felt his warm breath in her ear, and her whole body tensed.</p> <p>He stepped behind her and slid the straps of her dress up her arms, then dropped her dress over her head. His hands grabbed at her, and she felt as if he was pulling her toward him. She was standing in front of him, in front of the biggest man she had ever met. She was completely bare.</p> <p>"Are you sure about this?" She could feel him breathing heavy beside her. He was shaking with a desire to take her, right now, and she wanted it so badly. She wanted to tell him to stop, but she also needed him for her.</p> <p>"Yes," she said, "you don't have to stop."</p> <p>"I want to fuck you," he said, "I want to put my cock in you." His statement made her dizzy with shock, and a little more than arousal. He didn't say that he wanted to fuck her, but he needed her to know she was his. She felt in that moment like an independent being.</p> <p>He stepped forward to hold her from the side, the movement making his cock press against her again, but this time he didn't stop. He pressed his full weight forward, his pelvis against her belly. His hand on her stomach was steady as he guided his dick to her.
