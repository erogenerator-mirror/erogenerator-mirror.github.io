She saw a girl on a couch near the window looking over a pile of blankets. The girl, she said, came to the couch, looked her over and asked, "Are you alone, Missy?"</p> <p>"No, I'm not alone."</p> <p>"Good! You'll see. You can start at the top here. If you think you like something, just go and find it. You're doing very good so far--as long as you don't mind being naked, right?"</p> <p>The girl glanced down. Was her blouse open? Who was...?</p> <p>Then she reached a hand out. She was not wearing a bra!</p> <p>"What size?"</p> <p>She replied, "A 34."</p> <p>"And you're really thin!"</p> <p>She reached over and touched her own chest.</p> <p>"Oh, my God! That feels great! So how old are you?"</p> <p>"I'm eighteen, ma'am. Are you?"</p> <p>The young girl nodded as she pulled on her shirt. She stood up, crossed her arms and began to strip. Then the young girl was moving away from the window, her hair falling around her face. The other girl looked away from her and up to the window. She kept looking.</p> <p>Then the other girl stood up and reached her arm out for a blanket, pulling it across her bare breasts to cover them.</p> <p>It was a very cold blanket, and she turned to the other girl, "Can you put this on my back?"</p> <p>"It's okay - don't worry." The young girl seemed to be taking a walk, heading toward the door.</p> <p>The young girl was leaning against a wall of wooden crates. Her legs were wide apart. Her hands were on her knees, and she stared wide-eyed at the girl. She reached down and pulled the girl's towel up from under her breasts to the top of her thighs, but that didn't cover her pussy. Her thighs and the towel were in front of her, exposed, and she was wearing thigh-highs.</p> <p>The girl's voice said, "Are you okay?"</p> <p>The younger girl said, "Yeah... I'm okay, actually," she looked back at the blanket and said, "Come sit here."</p> <p>The younger girl stepped out of the blankets and moved to the blanket. This wasn't as bad as it looked. In fact, it looked like she had just stepped into a snow storm. Her breasts rose up into the dark fabric, her nipples stiff.</p> <p>The girl stood behind the young girl, reached around and touched her bottom. The girl gasped. Then she reached behind and took hold of her bottom. The girl's hands were now touching the girl's sides. A finger ran down the length of her backside, then back up, stopping to push the panties into her vagina. The girl felt a dampness there. "Is it okay if I kiss your bottom, Missy--?"</p> <p>The girl shook her head. She was staring at the girl.</p> <p>The girl took hold of the girl's cheeks. She bent forward. Her lips touched the girl's. They didn't touch. The girl leaned back against the wall.</p> <p>Then the girl put her hands on each side of the girl's bottom and pulled her down from the wall, turning her on her stomach. The girl was now sitting on the blanket with the girl's bottom against her thighs. The other girl had stepped behind the young girl. She looked down her front, then at the woman's naked body.</p> <p>The girl had a dream about this. A dream where this was happening to her. The girl didn't think it could possibly happen so fast. She looked back at The girl and asked, "What were you going to do to me?"</p> <p>The woman looked back. Her breasts thrust forward and pointed up, jiggling at a steady rhythm that spoke of the onset of her arousal. She said, "It was just a kiss. We have a lot of the same feelings."</p> <p>The girl looked at the other woman. "Really?" Then she said, in the same voice as The other one, "I'd love a lot of love and attention." She added the last two words, "Of course, if you want to, we wouldn't mind."</p> <p>The girl's face turned pale. She felt her own lips moving. Her mouth opened slightly. Then she said, "And I'd love to. But that's not what I meant." Suddenly her voice was soft, almost childlike, "I want to kiss The girl you're with right now, not just kissing her for her birthday."</p> <p>The girl felt the girl's breasts moving against her bottom.
