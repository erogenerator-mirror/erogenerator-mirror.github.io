I can call you from wherever I am. When I feel like it." I said with a wide smile.</p> <p>"Good, I know. I thought it sounded like you wanted some new thing to happen, like sex. That was nice, but I don't know whether I want to do it or not."</p> <p>"It was nice for a while but really, I think we're getting close, don't you agree?"</p> <p>"Definite, but there is another point to your point," I replied. "Can you talk?"</p> <p>"Sure. But I do love that idea."</p> <p>"But you know I really want to say no, to do what's, I don't know what, but there is only one thing left that I think is still right for me."</p> <p>"What is it?" I asked.</p> <p>She paused the video again and then, with a wickedly serious expression on her face, "Please, call your friend and tell him about this."</p> <p>"But it's just going to make it sound bad," I replied with a smile.</p> <p>With that she reached out and took my hand, pulling me towards the door and then the bed. "Wait here, okay?" she said, then disappeared into her closet on her way out.</p> <p>And with that she turned around, holding the door for me to enter. With one final pause she locked the door and then walked over to me, her hips swayed enticingly. She wrapped a leg around me, her lips inches from mine. She kissed me hungrily; the kiss lasted for a good ten minutes. When we separated I could feel her hot breath on my face. I turned my face towards her and she quickly pushed me down onto the bed, standing in front of me.</p> <p>She lifted her eyes to mine. "I really loved that, it was so intense and so much fun, I felt so alive."</p> <p>"No one knew about it," I responded.</p> <p>"No, you're getting the wrong idea," she responded, moving towards my hips and then settling between them. She looked into my eyes and said, "I think we should do something about this."</p> <p>She quickly slipped a finger into my pussy and I could feel every fold of her skin as it touched my lips. I quickly raised my hips as she continued to finger me. She began to trace my lips and clit with her finger, the warmth increasing with each kiss. Once I started trembling, she removed her finger, turned me over, pushed me onto my back, and resumed the kissing. She began to gently kiss my breasts, the nipples swelling against the coolness of her lips. She took my left nipple into her mouth, her tongue sending a chill through me as she sucked hard on my nipple.</p> <p>I tried to imagine what was in store for me next. It was a fantasy come true for a while now. And now she was finally getting to my pussy. She worked her way down my stomach, kissing down towards my mound until she reached my hot, wet lips. I could feel the heat rising as she gently kissed the sides of my lips and I could see her breath as she blew on them. When she reached my cunt, she lightly touched my lips, teasing them then she began to lick me from bottom to top, stopping briefly for a light lick of my clit before continuing on with an even more intense feeling of her tongue. My hips started to move in unison with her movements on my clit, the pleasure building once again. I didn't know I could be this excited, I wanted to try to describe every sensation to her, but somehow it was as if I was still in the room between her legs.</p> <p>I felt her fingers lightly touching my lips, spreading me ever further as she gently pressed a bit harder, pressing her fingers inside me. It was so wonderful, the feeling was so intense. If she thought I was having trouble breathing she was obviously correct. Suddenly her finger slid inside me, gently, then with more pressure, pressing against my g-spot while her tongue began to move faster and harder. She felt me, but felt around inside as I began to shake in response to the wave, a pleasure like I didn't even know existed. It was too much and before I knew it I was screaming as the first pulse of pleasure ripped through me and I was trembling against her tongue. When it was finally over I collapsed on the bed in a heap, trying to catch my breath but failing miserably.</p> <p>"I have never done anything like that," was the last thing I heard. I looked at her in surprise and she laughed, "No, I did not take care of that for you," she spoke quietly, as if she didn't know how to break the silence. "I want to see if you liked it."</p> <p>I looked up at her, but she said nothingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
