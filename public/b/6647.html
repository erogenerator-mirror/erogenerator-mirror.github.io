She shuddered as he slipped three fingers inside, and he pulled them out, holding them in front of her face. She was trembling.</p> <p>"Open them," he ordered.</p> <p>Her eyes widened as she obeyed. His fingers slipped to the top of her wetness, where a stream of clear juices streamed out from her hole, and he put his fingers on the tip of it, collecting the juices onto their fingers.</p> <p>He pushed her knickers down, then lay down on his back and pulled her down on top of him, his erect penis pressing against her thigh, his hands guiding her up and down his shaft. He was almost asleep by now, so he didn't bother to touch her as they made their love.</p> <p>At last he woke up to her body on top of him, and then felt her hot mouth wrapped around his penis, her tongue teasing the tip, her lips sucking the tip of it, her breasts pressed against his chest, her bottom squirming against his legs.</p> <p>He could not keep himself together for long. He took a deep breath and let himself go. A rush of hot semen hit against the back of her mouth, then another load landed on her skin.</p> <p>He held her by the waist as he shot again and again into her mouth, until he was spent, and the warm cum dribbled between her lips and over her chin.</p> <p>When they were sure he had taken his breath for a second, he lifted his hips so they could both get up onto their knees and face to face.</p> <p>She kissed him passionately.</p> <p>"Now I know why you always come here on holiday," she said. "Let's get into your bed. We really should've done this before."</p> <p>He did not understand how to reply to such a beautiful memory; his emotions and thoughts were too difficult.</p> <p>"But..." was all he got out.</p> <p>"But nothing. We will make it up to you."</p> <p>His reply was to lift her off his penis, which she lifted, so they could lie down on their sides. Her pussy was still dripping wet with the residue of their lovemaking, and both of them were still semi-erect when he sat down on the edge of the bed.</p> <p>"Why don't you sit up and get on your hands and knees," he said, pointing to the pillow. "Here, take a good look at yourself." He knelt behind her. "Hmm. No. Now do your face up."</p> <p>"But," she began. "This isn't my bed."</p> <p>But she was right. His view of her, both of them naked, and in his bed, was a different one altogether. "Yes, this is yours now, if you'd enjoy it."</p> <p>He pulled her by the armpits, forcing her to kneel on the edge of the bed.</p> <p>"Now," he said again, pointing to a mirror on the wall. "Now you, now, put your arms up above your head. Hold on." She obeyed.</p> <p>"Now, take your hands away," he added, putting more handcuffs on her wrists. He cuffed them behind her back.</p> <p>"Now."</p> <p>A tear made it's way down his cheek, and he wiped it away with his finger.</p> <p>"Are you ready when you are?"</p> <p>She nodded.</p> <p>He pressed one of his fingers into her mouth. "Now, suck it like the pet you are." So she sucked it, and made some more motions, until she got the head of it inside her mouth. She took it into her mouth a few times, and then gave him a couple more seconds of a sloppy suck, before standing up.</p> <p>She had not been expecting him to come into the room.</p> <p>"Now, turn away from me."</p> <p>She turned the head of his penis so she had a good view. The way her lips were gripping it there, the way her face was clenched up from being held like that by her bindings. The way she kept moaning.</p> <p>"Are you going to be a good girl, or do you want me to take your ass?"</p> <p>"No!" she cried. "But I can't!"</p> <p>He didn't seem to understand what she meant.</p> <p>He grabbed her wrists, but he didn't let her go. Then he brought his hand around to grip her breasts. He began to caress them, and he put his fingers under each breast. He squeezed them, and she was moaning.</p> <p>"Come to me!" he whispered, and she did, and he came over her back, his ejaculation jetting out right between her shoulder blades. It landed with a wet plopping sound right between her ass cheeks.
