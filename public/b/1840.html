You do not regret what you've done, not of your own volition, not of any self-satisfaction you might feel. And that's how it's going to be. From now on, you'll be my lover. My slave. And I'm going to love every moment of it. I promise.</p> <p>You're my slave now. What part of your mind is left out?</p> <p>The answer is 'slave' – of course. You will wear the blindfold. You will be made to do just about anything.</p> <p>As for you, I'll only have you once a night. I intend to give you more and more pleasure before I let you go. And for that, I'm counting on you.</p> <p>If you make me happy, you always'll be my slave.</p> <p>If you make me miserable, you should live with me.</p> <p>If you can't live with me when I find pleasure in pain or pleasure in torture, you should die. I'm counting on you.</p> <p>When did you plan to get here—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
