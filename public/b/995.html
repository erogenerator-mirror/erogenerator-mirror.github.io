My pussy started to tingle as I watched him, and I felt his cock jump against my leg and start to grow in my lap. It was so big and hard, and it stood like a tower before me; and he was definitely getting aroused.</p> <p>"I feel like a kid in the garage, being watched," he said to me as he slid his cock into my pants at the same time his thumb was stroking the cock that had just been in my hands.</p> <p>It was too much, and it made me shake and quiver, not only from the sexual rush, but from the heat of his hand stroking my hard cock. "I want you to fuck me, Jack," I answered as I sat there on the edge of the desk, my heart beating like a drum.</p> <p>He stared at me for a few moments as he rubbed his fingers over his cock, and then he moved his hand back to my lap, pushing my zipper down with his fingers. His hands stroked me with slow rhythm...the touch was enough to make my pussy quiver...it was a little weak, but I needed a good hard cock up inside me!</p> <p>I felt his hand on my dick, and he was rubbing the head of it through the fabric of my pants. It made me shiver and my body convulse. He pulled my dick slowly out from under my pants, and when I was free of my pants, it bobbed back down and down toward his body, as if it were a cock in a porn flick.</p> <p>Looking at my dick like that, he lifted his shirt off his shoulders, exposing his muscular chest. His hands went to his jeans button, and he undid them, quickly slipping my pants down while he was still stroking his cock with his palm.</p> <p>I sat in silence watching him, trying to take my mind off of the building sexual electricity that had swept through my body when I saw his hands working his cock, and the hard ridge of his hard dick peeking from his pants. For just a brief instant, I felt like I was looking at a statue, and I wanted to believe it. I was trying to take in a long, erotic image of my lover, and I couldn't take my eyes off of his sexy body. I reached up to run my hands over his smooth tanned face, and then I slowly ran my fingers over his lips, kissing them gently as I worked away at each button.</p> <p>"Hurry up, Jack," I purred at him as my mouth worked its way down to the base of his shaft. Feeling so good, and I could sense his heart beating with each breath he took with his lips.</p> <p>The head of his cock, so hard, so large, and so smooth, the heat from his body felt so much like the heat of a furnace as my fingers softly squeezed his shaft. I opened my eyes quickly as I watched him, and he stared back at me as I slipped his cock between my lips, his thumb pressing gently down at the base of that shaft, my pussy tingling as I kissed the head and felt it slide into my throat.</p> <p>The warmth of his hand on my cock made my stomach tighten. I felt his thumb press slowly into my bellybutton again, and I pushed it down further, deeper, and my balls jumped forward as I felt his fingers gently touch my ass.</p> <p>I looked up to him as I slid his shaft further into my mouth, my eyes watching as his head seemed so full and engorged as my mouth enveloped it. I loved the way my lips slid up and down his shaft, and it made his shaft move back to its own rhythm as I worked my mouth over his cock.</p> <p>His fingers slid inside my shirt as I worked his shaft up and down, feeling the fullness of his cock as it slipped across my tongue, the hardness of it almost like someone else.</p> <p>"Mmmm, that's what I like," I heard him say as I looked up again. His hand was still on my cock, but now it was rubbing his thumb around his tip, circling the sensitive head of my dick. My cock felt like it weighed the entire width of my body at this point, and I loved how it felt against my hand as I held it.</p> <p>"Do you wanna fuck me, Jack? Do you want me to suck your hard dick?" I asked as I felt him gently squeeze my cock between my fingers and my thumb. I felt his hand slide from my cock and I looked back at his cock as it slid into my mouth. My hand rubbed gently along the length of his shaft, up and down, and it was now covered in shiny, shiny precum.</p> <p>With my other hand, I reached down to his balls.
