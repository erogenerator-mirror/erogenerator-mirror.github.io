She kissed the tip of my nose as I placed my lips over the top of them and gently began to run my tongue all round, tasting the sweetness of her nipple as I would have liked to, I had never done this before and found it very arousing.</p> <p>"Oooh," she uttered before my lips touched hers once more and I pressed it hard against her nipple. "There." I released it and looked at, "Now suck it like a real woman." I lifted my head and slowly lowered it back down, feeling the softness against my lips as I kissed her nipple, savouring the softness before me. "Oooooh yes," I moaned softly as I ran my tongue around it with all the gentleness and speed I could muster, "That's so nice..."</p> <p>I held her tightly with my arms around her waist as I sucked on her tit and ran my tongue around it, making her tremble more as I did so, "Oooooooooh fuck," I cried out softly when I was satisfied that I could do it. "That was very nice," I sighed as I lifted my head from her chest. "Better do it again though," I gasped as I held myself still, "I'm glad you loved my mouth."</p> <p>"Why thank you," she said, her eyes smiling broadly at me as she lifted herself up enough to sit back down again. I followed her down and rested my mouth on her belly as she placed one hand on my head and held my face against her breast as she kissed my cheek and shoulder. "Now how about a little more of that?" she whispered. I kissed my way back up her belly and over her stomach, down to her hip and gently lifted it so that it rested against my lower stomach and her legs were draped over my thighs, "Mmmmm, what a cute baby that is." My eyes moved down to her pussy and I sighed as I watched her labia, "It's rather beautiful." I ran my tongue over her lips before it parted, "Thank you."</p> <p>I lay back on the bed with her and lifted my eyes back down to her pussy. "Why are you lying there over my face?" I asked her. I smiled when she smiled back and placed her legs back down in the crook of my arms, allowing me to rest my head against the softness of her stomach. The feel of her belly was lovely against me, especially when my hands were above her thighs as I held them open. For some moments we lay this way, our eyes smiling at each other while our bodies were pressed together and loving the sensations that it gave us. Neither one of us were trying to be affectionate with one another in any way; all we wanted to do was share and love. "Oh, God..." I groaned softly and ran my fingers over her legs as they continued to slide up over mine, "Do you like my lips against yours?"</p> <p>"God, yes," she whispered, her eyes opening briefly, "And you," she ran her hands around my face as she smiled at me and kissed the tip of my nose, "Don't talk, just take in it..." I kissed her lips gently. "That's it, just relax."</p> <p>I kissed her chin and her nose before placing my lips on hers again. "Mmm, it's lovely," I groaned as her lips parted beneath mine and I began to kiss my way down to her collar bone, sucking on just the small amount of skin before kissing her neck. The scent of her perfume was heavenly, not too strong here but warm, especially when mixed with the smell from her body. She made soft moans as I sucked on her throat, before opening her lips again to slide my tongue in and out of her mouth in a sensuously slow manner, "Mmmm," she sighed as my head moved further down until it reached her ribcage.</p> <p>"You know I've done that before," she murmured as I kissed the top of her breasts and circled around each nipple, "You wouldn't believe the love that I feel now." Her lips parted so I lifted my head up and placed her fingers over mine, letting her feel that as I kissed her mouth once more, "Oh, God," she sighed as I held her hand over mine, "I love it when you do that..." I kissed her as I cupped both her breasts in my hands as I began to gently run my tongue along her neck, her skin was silky smooth just like a woman's but had a different texture.
