They had a king-sized bed but it was only because he insisted the big beds were the only ones.</p> <p>"My king," he said, grinning broadly. He pulled a pillow out of the back of his bed, rolled it up, and slipped under the covers. She sat near the foot of the bed trying to think.</p> <p>"I'll give you the pillow," he said and she rolled over, putting it onto his pillow. She turned toward him. "How do you think your head feels?" she asked. He sat up, leaned over, and kissed her. When she returned his lips she tasted her own pussy on them, and they were still kissing. His hand snaked down to her breast and squeezed it, causing her to moan.</p> <p>He rolled his legs up a little and knelt over her, lowering his dick to her pussy. It felt amazing, her already moist lips being stretched around his large head. He slowly moved inside her slowly, savoring every inch of her. She moved her hands from his chest to his back as she felt more of him filling her. He slowly moved against her faster, knowing he was losing control of himself.</p> <p>Her breathing was becoming deeper, and heavier, and soon she became lost in a constant orgasm. It felt like her muscles were tightening around him, holding him inside of her. He wanted to feel her full, but couldn't, he needed to keep her coming before he came himself.</p> <p>Their bodies began to relax as he pulled out of her and she reached out, grasping his dick. He groaned as he felt the warm liquid pouring into her, and it was the first orgasm he'd ever had outside of his family. They kissed again as he moved between her legs, and as he was inside her he started gently thrusting into her again and again. Soon, his balls were slapping against her butt. He kissed her gently and played with her nipples between his fingers, watching her face, enjoying the expression.</p> <p>"You feel amazing," he said softly. Her body looked so sexy when she was on top of him, and he couldn't believe how good it felt when he was inside a tight pussy. It felt so amazing to have his dick inside her again. He could feel his head swell at the thought.</p> <p>"I wanna go to sleep," she said, kissing him again. "It's been a long day."</p> <p>"I understand. I enjoyed myself."</p> <p>"I really enjoyed it too," she said with a laugh.</p> <p>"That's because me making you feel that good is what made me feel amazing, right?" His dick was throbbing in her hand.</p> <p>"Of course it is," she said. She looked up into his eyes, and said, "Would you still like to spend the night here on my bed?"</p> <p>"Oh, you're just saying that to make me feel better." He pulled her in for a kiss, and once there they started making out again.</p> <p>"I love your body. It's incredible, and I don't know how I could have ever felt better in my life."</p> <p>"Well, I don't either," he said and grinned. He sat up, then leaned over and kissed her lightly on the lips as his hand came up to her breast. He kneaded it, then kissed her neck. "Did you feel better when I used to wake you up so hard?"</p> <p>"It felt great, but it was nice when I woke up," she said. She put her hand on his cheek. "I wanted you to be as hard as you are. It made it feel so good."</p> <p>"Of course it felt good," he said, giving her neck a playful slap.</p> <p>"I always feel so good with you," she told him.</p> <p>They kissed for several moments, when she got up to put on the clothes she'd put out on the counter. She pulled some panties on, put on her robe, and told him she'd be up in a few minutes. When she came out, she came into her room to put her bra on while he stayed in the other room. He couldn't help but stare at her backside as she crossed the room. He shook his head slightly, trying to clear it.</p> <p>"I was going to wait until I was ready to make my move on you again, but now that you're here, I'll do whatever it is that I wanted to do," she said with a smile, standing at the foot of the bed. She put her arms over the headboard, and he could see her breasts through her robe. "You can wait here if you want to get undressed," she said, sliding her hands into her robeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
