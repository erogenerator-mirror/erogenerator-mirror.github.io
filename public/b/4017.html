How?" I was shocked at my own language, and could not respond. It did not sound human to me now.</p> <p>"Why, you don't know her. She's been here forever." He continued, "My name is Eric. I'm a business associate, and here in this town... this is a city that just happens to see a lot of sexual activity for the majority of it's history."</p> <p>I was so stunned that I thought he had probably heard the entire story to get a reaction from the state as well as to the rest of his town. I could just imagine what he would do if he was the one to witness.</p> <p>"You're wrong."</p> <p>"It's not wrong, I can assure you," he interrupted me, "it's just been a while since I've felt a woman's body pressed up against mine. You, being one such a long time of age, must be very horny."</p> <p>What he said was more than a little true. I could have let him know it but I could not bring myself to respond.</p> <p>"So?"</p> <p>"So?"</p> <p>"I wouldn't mind if you wanted to do that again sometime."</p> <p>When he turned to leave, he continued. "And if you don't, please don't say anything to anyone for a while," he laughed, "you are so incredibly sexual. Especially with that big dick of yours."</p> <p>"I have no objection, but...."</p> <p>"But, you are not a virgin!" He said in that way that made me weak. I realized that it was very hard to be the first to say something.</p> <p>"I have always dated guys, and it just happened, so to be a virgin again would be even better."</p> <p>"So, what did you want to do?" He said as he stopped for a sip.</p> <p>"You've already said I can't go out with you!"</p> <p>"That's a big understatement." He said, as his eyes took in my body. I stood there, and he quickly grabbed a shirt and pulled it off. I could not believe what he had just said. He was so gorgeous, and I wanted to be in bed with him but my feelings for him just got better and better. I still did not know if I should go to him. Would he really fuck me the way he was fucking myself? What about him fucking his fiancée? He might be so much older than my mother, and that might have been a shock. I did not want to deal with such an issue right now.</p> <p>He pulled his shirt off and stood there, his hands slowly rubbing up and down my body, as he continued. "I was going to tell you one time, but it won't happen again. This is just between us." He said, his eyes never leaving me as his hand slid up to my stomach and slowly slipped beneath my bra. He cupped my full breasts in his hands, one hand sliding along my bra straps. He squeezed those large breasts, the motion causing them to lift upwards and expose the hard dark brown nipples. I felt his fingertips on the underside of my breasts and moaned. His hands began sliding over them, his fingers sliding over and pulling at my nipples until they were tight and distended. I held his hand tight against my breasts, and ground my pussy against his hand. In a way, I was being pushed further into the ground by my jeans.</p> <p>"This is wrong" I said as I tried to keep myself from moaning. He only groaned in agreement before leaning in close to me. "I have known a great many women who have had sex with men in my shop. I will not repeat any of that. This is an arrangement for us in which I do not control you by forcing you to be sex. Just let yourself experience whatever feels best for you." He said. I stood there in shock. It sounded so good. After so many years, he had changed me. It seemed like I was in another universe. I felt a need and excitement build within me. It was almost like it was all about control, only it felt so good. I did not know if the feeling of his strong fingers on my breasts would be as good or worse than mine. I was scared of how his touch would feel.</p> <p>"It's alright. I do not want to force you." He said, as he leaned in and kissed me, "You do anything I want, and I will just do it all. That is your decision."</p> <p>"Ok... but not tonight" I said, fighting to stay in control.</p> <p>"Alright. Now leave." He said, giving me a reassuring kiss and returning to the other customers.</p> <p>I could not turn away from him. I had to do it—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
