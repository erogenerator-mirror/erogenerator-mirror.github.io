"I've got some paper to write down before I bring it to her. Let's just get going." I followed him out of his office and into the elevator. "I know she loves your coffee," he said, putting it into the elevator with me. He looked over his shoulder as I climbed the stairs into his office, looking at me and nodding.</p> <p>"You go ahead and take care of some paperwork then I'll come back out. By the way . . ." I said as my gaze drifted down again when I noticed he was wearing jeans this time. "Maybe we better start working on her a bit more." He pulled a penknife from his coat pocket.</p> <p>"I know what I want," he said as I walked towards my desk. "Don't we have time?" I asked. His eyes glazed over before he nodded. He wrote out his first draft on a notepad, taking a moment to look up from it.</p> <p>"Well... how do we start? I wanted to tell you before I left here to come in and do a few things for me," he announced as he started back up. "But it seems this is my last chance."</p> <p>"I've got some work on that, actually," I told him. "How about you, Bill? Can we just drop it and go from there?"</p> <p>"I guess. But just so soon?" He glanced back at me with the pen knife in his hand.</p> <p>"You got it? I'm so hungry right now." I stepped towards him. "So, what's this going to be all about?" I asked as I stepped over him and he put down a stack of papers in front of me.</p> <p>"I want to see something about her first and you're the first part of it. I want to know what it feels like and she likes what you do to her but she does not want something as plain as you doing it to her." I handed him the papers before turning to leave, moving across the room.</p> <p>"I'll see you in about 30 minutes," I said as I left his office and headed to the elevator, stopping in front of him as I kissed him on the cheek. "I'd be pleased to show how well you and she know how she likes," I said as he nodded in agreement. "I hope your not upset, Bill. You could say I'm in love with you."</p> <p>"You think that? I thought we were pretty good." I pulled the door open to his office and looked down the hallway. I saw him turn on the lights, the first of what seemed like decades of living on his own. He looked at me with a puzzled expression.</p> <p>"I'm not worried. I don't have to hide anything." He said. "You just look pretty damn beautiful tonight. She's going to like you. I'm sure it will be something for her." I watched from the doorway as he sat back down on a leather couch.</p> <p>"Okay," I said finally. "We'll just go from there." I turned so he could see me. "Bill, I've got to tell you something. Your not a bad guy. I mean that. You're just too busy to worry about that." I nodded and leaned back on the couch so I could see him. "Bill, you're going to be her lover. I just don't know if you or I can get her to let me do anything other than that."</p> <p>He looked at the floor, his eyes looking up at me. Then I looked down for a moment to make myself seem more important and looked back up at him. He reached a hand down to me and I sat up, giving him a small smile as I crossed over to him. He looked up at me as I placed my hand on his cheek and I saw him shudder for a second.</p> <p>"I want to make you happy, Mark." I said as I rubbed my hand against his arm. I saw the way his eyes followed my hand as I ran one hand up his cheek to his jawline. I saw him tilt his head up as I gently slipped my hand past his to the one leg. "I know you're not a bad man," I said as I gently pressed my cheek to his.</p> <p>"You don't have to be nice to me," he said as he pushed away from me and took a step away from his desk. His hands went to his pockets, searching through the dark, expensive looking papers in his hand. "I don't deserve you." He whispered as his eyes focused on the top of my head. My face fell as I stared at him, my jaw trembling slightly and my body tensing with arousal.</p> <p>"Come on, Bill. Don't be so stubbornâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
