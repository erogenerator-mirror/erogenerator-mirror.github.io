So after two years of college I was a bartender once again!</p> <p>Then I met and married the man from the office who had the best record I ever beat. I got a great job and a really great apartment. We never had a serious relationship, I'm happy to say I never had the desire to have any kind of real relationship with a woman, even in the beginning of our romance.</p> <p>So, after our love affair turned into more that just a friendly fling, we got it started. Our first love affair was, at first, about fifteen minutes and a lot of heart stopping. It started in the bedroom, which was only about two feet by ten feet, we never fucked in there.</p> <p>It started at the beginning with me making love to her for the first time. So it lasted almost ten days that first night, at that point I just needed to have sex as much as I needed to.</p> <p>Then, after a lot of foreplay and sucking, I just couldn't get it up any more, which was one of the longest ten days of my life, with nothing else in the world but her.</p> <p>Well, we finally got it up the second day of sex, and we went together off to bed. We lay there for about five minutes, kissing each other and caressing each other's bodies. I started in on her, and we just spent the next two hours, kissing and slowly stroking each other.</p> <p>Then I rolled her on top of me, slowly sliding my dick into her very wet pussy. We fucked slowly and passionately for what seemed like forever, my dick never leaving her.</p> <p>When we finally came, we both collapsed onto the bed.</p> <p>At some point, or when I couldn't take it anymore, I rolled over on my back, and she straddled me, facing me and slowly lowering her body down as she moved slowly backwards and forward, my cock sliding into her pussy over and over.</p> <p>I was in heaven. Here I was with just about everything I had ever wanted in my life on the most private of beaches in the world, doing something that most people wouldn't have a right to do with their husbands, and I loved it!</p> <p>Of course, her body and mine were doing the same thing, and neither of us could take it anymore!</p> <p>It was at that point that all our thoughts were consumed by that damn "sex" that we were both doing. What had just happened to us? And what I didn't realize in the first place, what it would take to have my life back on the right track.</p> <p>And I wanted to ask her about it at first. I wanted to see what I did to her, how did it happen, the things I loved most. I wanted to know what it did for her. I wanted to know how she felt, who she felt, what she did.</p> <p>But there's more, it wasn't in my heart to let go of. It was like I wanted to stay there and have the best of everything. The answer was there.</p> <p>After a little while I started getting the feeling from her that she wanted to know more about me.</p> <p>It wasn't very original, but I got the feeling that she might not feel what was going on though. That wasn't my intention at all. I never expected it to be that way, and when it did, it was pretty damn much what I expected.</p> <p>That night, I took her out to dinner. We spent a lot of time in a booth outside, and I was getting really turned on when we went to the bar. I ordered her a drink, and we talked for a while, and I just told her about my life in college, how our love had changed, and what she could do for me.</p> <p>I had an immediate question though; what does she think of it? How did she think that it got past me that I was into the sex thing?</p> <p>So, I told her.</p> <p>To paraphrase: 'What makes the sex that much better than what you two do on the beach with the stars above?' She listened, and after a pause she asked; "Have you ever thought about telling me what it was like to get really fucked?"</p> <p>That was pretty much all I thought I would say to her.</p> <p>Sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
