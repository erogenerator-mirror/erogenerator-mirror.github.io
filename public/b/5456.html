I'd met him there and we'd been married, but he'd stayed in the habit of taking the photos. The first time I met him he was with his wife, but the fact that I had a very short skirt added to our sex life. He'd been looking at some of the photos I'd just brought home and he'd asked me to come and watch. I'd thought of a few of the photographs, a man's cock in a women's cunt, but it didn't matter as I had made myself cum before I could sit in my office and watch him. He'd said it was all real and he'd come as many times as he did.</p> <p>As the photo album finished it hit me like a punch in my stomach – the best way to say it. It was the first time that I had ever had a session with a man – I couldn't believe it. With a smile I continued to look at the pictures. The idea that I would be able to just watch him was still a fantasy though; I still had some of the photos – but he hadn't said they had been taken when he was getting an erection. It made me realise that if he took any pictures of me as well, he was going to fuck me. I didn't have the strength to stop him – and I could have!</p> <p>I got up a few days later and went to his work, thinking of getting a few more pictures. I had to make some plans of my own, and it really turned for my life on the spot.</p> <p>I went into his office, and sat on the floor near his feet. He had one of those desk chair type desks – but I didn't think it was a bad thing as his desk had a foot long leather chair at its end with a chair handle in the middle. We started with the first picture I had of him; one of him in a bathrobe – and the last one, when I was dressed in one of the skirts of my habit, showing off that wonderful ass that he'd had. He told me the idea of being watched was exciting him as well and even if he didn't have the balls to ask me if I had enjoyed watching, I could still watch him, so I agreed.</p> <p>I looked at them for a moment and then realised that I'd forgotten to take them out – I hadn't checked that he had a camera. I looked down again and tried to keep my eyes from the photos but eventually I had to pick one out and re-open it. The look on his face when the pictures were taken had almost changed to surprise when I put the folder on the table.</p> <p>'I hope you have some nice pictures of me, please' he asked with a leer on his face. I looked him straight in the eyes, not really wanting to be seen as a spoilt child, but knowing that he'd probably want to see more.</p> <p>'OK,' I replied, moving the folder away from the table.</p> <p>On the folder there were some photos of various sexual activities between a fellow male and his female (and one I hadn't been able to name) and some even of him and a woman doing more, and a very well known site of the two of us fucking in his office on his computer desk in which we had been sharing the photos – but he hadn't called me the picture I'd taken.</p> <p>'Would you take any shots of me with that folder open please?' I asked.</p> <p>'Of course, I'm not allowed to look at them until you tell me to. Go ahead.'</p> <p>'But I have to admit – there's just something about you being able to see me – well, you're quite obviously aware of these pictures. And I'm getting a strange feeling from looking at them.'</p> <p>I went back to the portfolio and pulled out the pictures. I placed them on his desk.</p> <p>'If you're trying to hide the fact that you've still got to look at pictures of me, you're doing a little foolish, aren't you?' He looked at my still on the desk in one of his suit jackets – and a small smile still appeared on his face – as if his smile had been made with love - and his hands were shaking a bit.</p> <p>'Look at the pictures again, please. I'm sure you like the ones, don't you?' I asked.</p> <p>I stood back as he took several more of my pics, some with the top couple of buttons undone, some of me on my front, some of me on my back, some of me being naked, some of me on top of him, some being very, very, very close to me. I felt my pussy starting to get warm and wet.</p> <p>'So many pictures—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
