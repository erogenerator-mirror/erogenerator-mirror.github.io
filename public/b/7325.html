However, it had all been very good, as she had many good times with more than one man. This really suited her fine.</p> <p>It felt good to lie in bed with a man and have him fondle her body without having to do a single thing. Especially when it had been her that had brought the guy the first time. Then she would lie back under the covers with her legs open and stroke his penis. He would then turn her on her stomach and have easy access to her sweet bottom. Of course it was all very nice!</p> <p>She would then let the boy put his finger into her nether hole and finger her a bit. She was beginning to feel like herself again. She didn't want a relationship based on a one time only experience. That would just make her unhappy, she could always change her mind or end it any time. And of course she had just been fucked hard and long by her first and most important man.</p> <p>But this was new and exciting. This way all went on all the time. It felt good!</p> <p>The first couple months after she found this fantasy had been wonderful. Yes, she was beginning to like it just a little. Yes, she had always fantasized about a threesome or threesome with another woman when they were in bed. They certainly wouldn't have taken that risk with her being faithful. In fact, she thought her affair was getting rather stale.</p> <p>But the time with him made her have many more experiences and even less inhibitions, and it seemed like now she was enjoying the whole experience. The fact she seemed to have enjoyed every minute of it just added to this excitement! She was enjoying herself even more.</p> <p>One night, a week or two ago, she had just been working late and thought she was going home. She wasn't sure what kind of house but she decided to take a bath in the tub and go out into the kitchen to get some dinner prepared.</p> <p>When she came back in the room, she quickly poured herself a glass of wine and walked over to the closet to get herself a robe. While she was dressing, she was admiring the way her breasts swayed under the cloth. She had to admit that when she bent over in front of the mirror to get the robe on, the robe rode up and her lovely ass and the cleft between her cheeks was exposed. She was really starting to enjoy looking at herself like this in the mirror. She wondered if maybe she should take the robe off. Actually, she did wish she had done so. But she didn't want to look "down" on her friend's husband.</p> <p>She slowly let the robe slide off her shoulders and off. She was feeling really sexy. She just had to be careful with her hair when she got up. She didn't want to let her hair down.</p> <p>She was also getting very aroused. The thought of her friend's husband looking at her naked body and thinking that he was fondling her excited her also. She knew the thought only served to excite her more. They often had their fantasies made about her, but there never really was any action involved, not even in the bedroom. But that was how it was with her. She wondered if she could actually do what her husband had done to her while they watched. She felt that if he did it, she would enjoy it, but it didn't happen.</p> <p>She opened up the closet door to see if she could find something. But it wasn't there. "Damn!" She thought. What else would be there? She thought, "What if he found it in the bottom drawer." She grabbed the dresser mirror and ran around the bathroom. Then she returned the dresser to the closet. She had one more thing to do before her husband and lover came back.</p> <p>She pulled back the top of the closet door, stood still watching as the bathroom door opened. Then she backed up until her shoulder was just about a foot away from the door's doorknob. She turned back and started removing her clothes. She kept her arms straight out, feeling very sexy. She could feel the wetness building with each pull of her robe. There was a lot of her wetness leaking down her thighs out of her swollen sex. She slipped the robe off and stepped in the bathroom.</p> <p>She was in the tub for a minute just looking at her reflection in the mirror. She was surprised at her own sexuality. She really liked her body. It was her own and she didn't feel it was all for her. But, she was feeling very erotic. She was also feeling horny. She felt very desirable as she walked to the mirror and began thinking of her friend's husband. He was a good deal older than her. He was very good looking and he had been a very good father.
