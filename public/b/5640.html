"Hey, sweetie, it's nice to see you!"</p> <p>I leaned over and kissed her cheek. "Hi. Long time no see," I said as my lips left them. She was blushing a bit under her red hair.</p> <p>"Long time no see?" she giggled.</p> <p>Her smile brightened as I leaned over and kissed her again, this time longer, and her eyes closed.</p> <p>My tongue flickered against her lips and she parted them willingly. My hand gently slid up under her breast and she moaned softly.</p> <p>Her breast was small and soft, and I took one of her thick pink nipples into my mouth and sucked.</p> <p>"Oh!" she moaned.</p> <p>I looked up at her smile. She had never been shy about playing with herself before.</p> <p>Her hand slid down to my cock, and she started to caress it while I sucked on her nipple. It got a reaction out of her, and I realized how big her nipples were.</p> <p>Her free hand moved up to my other breast as she pushed down on my cock.</p> <p>I moved away a little, and whispered something. She turned to face me, her beautiful eyes filled with lust. Her hand took my cock in her hand and stroked it a little.</p> <p>"What?" I asked.</p> <p>"That's what you're going to do to me when I get home," she said softly.</p> <p>"But how," I asked.</p> <p>She stood and dropped her robe to the floor. Then, she stood in front of me and stood naked for a moment. She cupped her breast in her hand, lifting the soft orb and then letting it drop onto her thigh. My eyes moved from her breasts, past her flat stomach, to her hips and thighs.</p> <p>I was so excited I could have come right then and there.</p> <p>She reached out and put her arms around my neck and rested her lips on mine. "I'd really like that, Mr. Anderson," she whispered in between kisses. "Your cock is hard as a rock, Mr. Anderson."</p> <p>There was no hesitation before I knew I'd made it. Her hands moved over my chest, across my stomach.</p> <p>My hands slid down over her ass, caressing the plump flesh and gently pushing her lower.</p> <p>My fingers found her slit as my lips followed in her steps.</p> <p>"Take off your clothes, Mr. Anderson, and come home with me."</p> <p>"What?" I said, my hands coming up to cover hers.</p> <p>"Come home with me, and we'll have a good time and we won't leave this room until next week," she smiled.</p> <p>"But...but my clothes...I won't be able to do this," I said, still unsure of how to get home if she led me anywhere.</p> <p>"No, come with me," she said softly. "And don't argue. We'll be having sex in a very special way. Just come home as soon as you can and we'll be very happy."</p> <p>I followed her up the stairs, looking at the bedroom, but trying to think of a way to explain to her.</p> <p>"Mr. Anderson, the last thing I ever thought at that place we ever had was going to have sex," she said. "I guess I didn't expect it to be this wonderful. I'm glad you were there for me. I still want to please you. I want to have lots of orgasms."</p> <p>She looked down for a minute, and then turned to walk into the bedroom. Before she left her shoes and socks on the floor, my hands were covering hers. Her body was warm and soft.</p> <p>She stopped in front of me and kissed me gently. "We're going to take care of each other," she said softly.</p> <p>She took my hands and placed them on her breasts. My fingers felt the softness of her breasts as I pinched the nipple between two thumbs.</p> <p>"Do you know what it would be like if you took pictures of me when I was getting ready for my date?" she asked, looking up at me.</p> <p>"Sometimes," I whispered, my fingers following hers to grasp the nipples at the same time.</p> <p>"Sometimes!" she exclaimed, looking up. "You're so lucky to have someone you like, and someone that knows how to make me feel like a woman."</p> <p>My lips moved over hers, tasting her slightly, and feeling her hips move in response. Her lips parted and she kissed meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
