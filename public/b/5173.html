One of her hands went round me and into my shoulder, holding me in her fingers as kisses slid down to her chin, then down, then round each thigh as I did so.</p> <p>'God', she moaned, 'I've been waiting to touch you but now I've got to have you inside me'.</p> <p>I was a bit disappointed but tried to get my head round it as it was. 'We've only just met, I didn't know what this was about until you put it in me. I'd really like to do this, I have to do this'.</p> <p>'Well, I guess that means you want me as a lover, doesn't it? I said that if that was what you wanted, I liked the offer. Just as long as it was good for you, you'd want more?' 'You're so sweet', she added, 'and so good to me, you can have me any time you like, any time you like'. Then we both laughed at the double meaning, but did.</p> <p>'But it's got to be my turn in the bathroom before we go any further, OK? You must be a bit nervous so don't ask me to stop'.</p> <p>'Please don't stop' she moaned, 'I've never ever before taken a penis up my bum, it's too big, OK? God, I want to but I'm not sure it's right for me now. But OK, take your time, I'm a bit impatient now'.</p> <p>As I turned off the light, she sat up and turned over, her head on my chest, and began to fondle my cock, getting it hard again as I cupped her tits in both hands.</p> <p>'Are you enjoying that?' I said softly, as she looked up at me through parted eyelashes.</p> <p>'Oh yes, it feels wonderful'.</p> <p>'Can I ask you a question?'</p> <p>'Yes'</p> <p>'Why do you prefer you have a penis up your bum?'</p> <p>She looked at me and smiled. 'That's a big one. It's got a big head and that's where I like it. There I said it was OK for you to stick it up my bum.'</p> <p>'There's more?' I asked.</p> <p>'Right now I'm having a very hard time thinking of having you inside me like that but I think the thought of getting my bum fucked, even thought you might be able to make me into a woman'.</p> <p>As she lay there enjoying her own private moment in my arms, I couldn't resist her other suggestion.</p> <p>'As you can see, you can see the end of my penis sticking out of my bum.' Her hand had gone back into her bra, now pressing it forward, as she continued to caress herself underneath her skirt, rubbing her clitoris.</p> <p>'Would you do that for me?' I said, a bit uncertain, but willing to go along with any request.</p> <p>She looked so desirable lying there, her blouse pulled right off her, a lovely lacy bra, her bare legs wide apart under a skirt, and her fingers stroking herself.</p> <p>'OK, well now,' she said, 'where did you get that idea?'</p> <p>'In the toilet this morning', I said, and moved up the bed to kneel between her legs. 'But first I'd like you to take things a little further in the toilet.'</p> <p>I slipped her skirt and panties down over her legs and off her feet, then reached inside her bra to fondle her breasts as I went. Her nipples were firm and long, obviously excited.</p> <p>'That feels so good, come on'. she said as she lifted her bum-cheeks high for me to move the end of the bath towards her, so I could slip into it easily. As I got my first erection up inside her, she gave a long moan. We stayed that way for a while, just savouring the intimacy and having a lovely moment together.</p> <p>'OK, it's getting late, I don't want you to get any sleep, OK?' I said, kissing her gently on the mouth.</p> <p>As this was all just about the foreplay for both of us, I told her it was now my turn, so she leaned back and put her legs round my waist, pulling me in so my cock was still as deeply inside her as I could be. I felt the slippery wetness of her vagina and the gentle pressure of her muscles against my cock. As the first wave of an orgasm hit her, she gave a sudden groan and I felt her vagina tighten and begin to spasm as she climaxâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
