I don't think we need any more beer."</p> <p>Well, she wasn't getting away with that, either. I just laughed.</p> <p>All was still quiet, the rest of the night seemed to be a blur. I heard the shower running and I thought it might be a couple of hours. When it turned into the second half of the night, I had drifted off to sleep. I was awoken by something at the top of my pillow. There was a hand on my cock, and on it. With my eyes shut, I didn't realize my cock was in Kim's mouth. Oh, what to do.</p> <p>I didn't wake until about the fourth night. I was out of bed and I heard the shower start again. I went back to bed and I'm sure there was a hand on my cock the whole time. Just thinking about it made me go off. When I went to turn over, it was Kim sucking me off. I thought a smile would be a very welcome sight, just with the water running and everyone watching from around my cock. Her breasts hanging before her face. When it became obvious I was about to come, she took me out.</p> <p>I woke up the next morning with a hard on. A hand between my legs and her mouth clamped to my cock. All of a sudden I felt something against my lips. With a hand I opened my eyes to see, Kim on her knees between my legs. I couldn't help seeing her beautiful tits bobbing up and down on top of me. After seeing me naked, she stopped sucking. "No, wait," I said. She stood and took off her pants, shoes, socks, and panties. She then crawled on top of me, kissed me on the lips, and slowly moved to straddle my face. Before I could get my tongue in her, I felt her come all over my face.</p> <p>I was so turned on I was coming in seconds. Kim didn't stop sucking. She wanted it all and she came just before I shot my load inside her.</p> <p>I finally awoke the next morning with a hard on. Kim climbed on top of me and her mouth engulfed my still hard cock. I came in no time.</p> <p>We continued our relationship in the next couple weeks, but the sexual side of things is still a little bit wild.</p> <p>After our breakup, Kim seemed to like me. She got a job as a house assistant in a big city. Her skills made her a millionaire, and she got along real well with other young girls. Kim even dated some guys at the club, but I never did anything, except watch her from time to time. However, she never told anyone about me. She didn't even hint that something could happen between us while at the club, and never said a word about our breakup.</p> <p>I found out her secret fantasies. They are just fantasies. They are the fantasies I told her about several weeks before.</p> <p>If you want Kim to stop and see me, you have to write to let me know. I love hearing about your fantasies. I want to hear about hers.</p> <p>I love hearing from you,</p> <p>Jamesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
