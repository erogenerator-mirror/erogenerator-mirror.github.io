I am not sure exactly what that means, but that's how he is. Not the other way around, not anymore, he just feels like the young man he is and everything he does, no, that's not really it. I mean, he knows what it means. I've done some things with him that would be considered a real 'douche'. Even as a boy, I wasn't quite as 'ready' as I was when I was his age. Still, he's the perfect young man, I tell myself, and that's what makes him so special to me.</p> <p>And then, when I am in bed asleep, or dreaming of one of the things happening the last time that I wake up and know it's happening again ...</p> <p>His hand slowly starts to slide up my arm. I feel like my body is waking up and just about to go off, but I'm not sure what about that is real. I feel his hand slowly moving, sliding up and over my shoulder. I feel him move over my shoulder and turn my head towards him. He's not moving it, either, he's just holding it a little bit and giving it a stroke. He's just holding it, feeling it, and watching it grow from him to me and back again. The light comes to me again, and this time, I have to catch a breath, to try to sort out all the feeling and feelings. I feel my hand moving and he's following it. His hand never stops moving, it just keeps coming closer to my face ... it goes back and forth ...</p> <p>I try to find the words to describe what just takes place.</p> <p>'Oh, fuck.'</p> <p>I feel his hand stop ... the heat from his fingertips, and then... It's not moving and it's not moving fast and hard and long ... just a small jerk or something, sort of, and then it stops. He's just holding it, my mind feels numb, and I think I'm about to cry and the thought of him holding me makes me cry out ...</p> <p>A little later and I'm waking again, and this time the feeling is one I've never felt before. I remember his hand on my ... my side ... it's very, very firm on my side. I have no idea why I'm in bed with a guy I really love, maybe he's making love to me.</p> <p>I wake up about 3 or 4 hours later and feel a sort of heat on my body, as though someone is washing my body. I feel a finger stroking me at the lips of my pussy, and the heat goes from where it was to a kind of hot feeling, all the way up to a kind of like feeling ... then ... I feel a finger slipping into me ... oh, fuck, he's fucking me with that.</p> <p>It's really hot, and it takes me a few minutes to realize it's me with them.</p> <p>'Whoa, babe, whoa ...'</p> <p>I lie there for a while, just trying to sort things out. I feel a sort of pressure in my tummy, and I'm looking at myself over and over in mirror. My arms are shaking and my legs are twitching ... I feel ... a bit of panic ... but I also feel a sort of excitement ... and I start to move my hips and lift my hips and I'm pushing my pussy against this hand ...</p> <p>I open my mouth and I find him looking ... oh, fuck, he's watching me ... I think I'm crying. He looks up at me and smiles and then he starts to move a little, and I'm watching him go higher and higher and I suddenly realize that he's still fucking me. He's still just looking at me as he moves. It's hard to say... the pleasure I was getting from that ... that he was doing it without a condom on ... it's hard to understand it. And now it's coming closer to the final act. I try to take a deep breath to calm myself down and maybe calm down myself too ... but I don't see it. It doesn't move ... it just goes in and out, really just sliding back and forth ... it feels good ... and it still doesn't move and then it stops again ... but still it doesn't move much. I sit up a little more and feel the warmth ... and a different one ... and ... I've never felt like that before.</p> <p>I try to get up and sit up to watch him, to do some of the things that have always seemed to happen in the movies. It doesn't take much time for me to become aroused again and I feel it just starting. I sit up again and try to get into something to do but I'm still sitting up, as if holding something up, not moving ... all this while I'm watching him make love to my .... that makes me start to feel a little weak in the kneesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
