This woman had a power of her own and I was totally enthralled. Her lips were soft and her tongue caressed my face like a lover would. With the last bit of willpower I possessed not to let the moment crush me. She pressed me against the wall as she ground her body against mine. I felt her hands on my face and she stroked my lips. "I love your lips," she whispered as she nipped my bottom lip.</p> <p>She kissed me once again. Her lips lingered. This time, instead of attacking my mouth, she traced the outline of my lips with her tongue. The kiss was as if she loved to tease me with its promise. I felt like a butterfly, fluttering about my neck and flinging me over the edge of a cliff. With her tongue, her hand traced my lips back to meet her tongue.</p> <p>With her lips and tongue, her hand played in my hair like a master musician. My hands roamed her back as she ran the back of her hands along the contours of my own body. She slipped them inside to massage my buttocks. For a moment, I was worried if I wanted the night to end, but in fact it would end anyway, at least for now.</p> <p>I pulled away. "My car is gone," I told her. "It's a long stretch."</p> <p>I was going to leave it be. I was going to go back to my motel, and let her fuck me, but this time I wanted it hard and fast for as long as I could. In the end, I would be alone in my room. I had always wanted to do this but was unable to do it. My heart was beating fast.</p> <p>I took a deep breath. "This weekend," I said, smiling, "I will not feel like I am cheating on your husband."</p> <p>I felt her hands on my hands on my cheeks. For a moment, we just stood there. Then she kissed me. Her hands left my face and began a rhythmic massage. I felt as if I were floating. There was nothing I could do.</p> <p>"Are you wearing any clothes?" she asked.</p> <p>I shook my head. My eyes were downcast.</p> <p>"Yes. Only my skirt."</p> <p>I stood slowly, waiting for her next command. "Get the door."</p> <p>"What?" I asked curiously.</p> <p>"Open the door and pull down your skirt," she ordered.</p> <p>With my heart beating hard, I walked around the room. I pulled down my skirt, stepped free of it with a single foot, and pulled it over my head. The silkiness of the skirt was as soft as when I last saw it. On the floor in front of me was the most beautiful thing I had.</p> <p>"Put it on," she said.</p> <p>I had never heard this before; it was as simple as that. "What? What do you want me to put it on?"</p> <p>I didn't understand. She didn't wait for me; she put on her own skirt. "Put it on," she again commanded.</p> <p>I took it off and put it on.</p> <p>"I didn't think I would wear your dress to bed, but that could be arranged. This is the way I like you in my bed."</p> <p>She stepped out of her heels, stepped onto my bed, and climbed onto it herself. Standing beside me, she kissed me and held me in the same way as a lover would touch my body. As I melted against her, there was no other word to convey my feelings or feelings for her at that moment. This was more than I had felt in many years.</p> <p></p> <p>Over the next months, we spent almost every night naked on top of the bed, kissing and feeling what was ours. I lost my virginity to someone I never would have imagined. I loved every moment of it, for in the end, I was the one that had finally accepted the beauty of our mutual sexuality. We loved to look at the other until we couldn't take anymore.</p> <p>When I felt the time was right and I was ready for her on top of me, I took the nightgown off and got on the bed beside her. The sensation of her silky panties against my skin excited me. I slipped my free hand under the silky fabric, cupped her breast and felt her hardening nipple press against me. She sighed.</p> <p>"It felt so good," she breathed.</p> <p>"It was you who felt good," I said, knowing it had to be my own imagination. "You looked like a beautiful woman."</p> <p>"I thought you didn't like the look."</p> <p>"It was very handsome," I told her. "In fact, why don'tâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
