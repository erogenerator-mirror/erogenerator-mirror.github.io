A small smile crossed my lips. "Well," I said with a slight tremor in my voice, I knew it wasn't for me. I just liked to think. "Yes?"</p> <p>"Well ..." I didn't know how to address her question or her body language. She was right there in front of me and I was just supposed to walk out. I turned around to watch him as he walked right up to me and I looked him up and down again. "So is that it?" he asked. I told him I'd heard he was the man with the ring, he said he'd be in his office all day. His eyes flashed over to me and he smiled again. I knew just as well that he had seen my dress in action and if that is what it had to do with him I wasn't going to back down.</p> <p>"And are you a virgin?"</p> <p>"No," I said. I was afraid of the answer. He had never spoken to me that way and I didn't want to upset him and make him feel uncomfortable. "No."</p> <p>"Well, let's get you home," he said, "and I don't want to ruin our little adventure."</p> <p>I nodded as he helped me out of the car and into his building again.</p> <p>***</p> <p>I was glad to be out of the car. I wasn't sure what to expect at the moment. I walked straight up to the door and he was behind me, hands on my shoulders in that soothing way. "What was that for?" I asked. He didn't reply, he just looked up at me and I could see a smile on his face.</p> <p>"I want my own," I told him, not sounding much like myself. He smiled as his fingers ran all over my arms again. I walked through the front door past his office and back to the elevator doors. I tried to keep up with him. I loved watching him walk. He had so much power and it just made my body tingle. When we got on the elevator he pressed the next floor button.</p> <p>"Thank you, I needed that," I said, "You have no idea just how hard I wanted that." He started to open the door for me as we entered the elevator, and I just let out a little giggle at that.</p> <p>We got into his floor and walked up my short hall way and into his office, I started to feel a little self conscience. I think I may have even felt a little self conscious, but I am not that person. After a little discussion we just stood around a little. I still had on my heels and he took that as a good sign. "What is this all about," I asked. He just nodded.</p> <p>"What's this all about?" I asked again, my heart suddenly pounding. I walked straight up to him and just stared hard at him.</p> <p>"It's because I found out about your little secret," he told me, "I didn't know that you knew about that."</p> <p>I felt my palms get sweaty as I was suddenly glad he didn't make us look like we were walking to his cubical; just a couple of steps down the hall I caught a glimpse of his face. It was a hard smile to make. He seemed so happy just to see me right up to my very eyes. When we got to his office he looked me up and down. I couldn't decide if I should just stand still or get that feeling again. "Here," I told him, "come on in." To say I was nervous would be an understatement. It did take me a moment to understand why. He had put a key into the lock and it didn't make sense for me to go back out there, that would be the end of what I was after.</p> <p>"Your heart isn't beating so good," he said as he let go of one side of my hair and started to close the door, it felt cold. I tried not to look at him, not because he was looking at me or that he had been staring at my legs. I just walked up to him a little nervous and kind of afraid, but I did want him so bad the moment he closed the door. When he turned around I didn't hesitate to drop to my knees. I just put my face right at his feet. I just held up one finger and kind of looked up into his eyes, "I want you sooo bad."</p> <p>He just stared at me with that smile still on his lips. I was scared he actually liked what he saw. I couldn't help but wonder if it was that feeling I had come to feel again. Maybe if I hadn't come to feel that feeling in some way. I was a little afraid I would make him feel that way again, that this would hurt himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
