He'd been at her, too. He was in his early 50's and a man in his mid-20's, tall, brown hair, glasses, wearing a leather jacket.</p> <p>"Mrs. Miller?"</p> <p>It was a woman, maybe 40. He could tell she wasn't the best looking and most vulnerable of women. And that would be me.</p> <p>"Yes, hello. What can I do for you?"</p> <p>"...you have a name?"</p> <p>She smiled. "I'm Mandy."</p> <p>I was frozen.</p> <p>"It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Miller. Maybe we can have dinner later, maybe talk," he said, as he took her hand and they walked out of the store. I didn't even know what he meant by "talk", but I was frozen. For the first time, I felt like I was in some kind of trance.</p> <p>He took me out to his car, where he drove us to a bar in the city and we sat down. I felt awkward, but somehow, I found myself liking him. He leaned over and kissed me, on the cheek. I could feel his large, warm hand rubbing my ass. Then he lifted my dress, revealing my panties and I could feel my pussy throb with excitement. We stood up, and I turned to face him.</p> <p>He took the wine glass from my hand, turned his face so I could kiss him. He kissed me, passionately, his tongue teasing mine. I felt his breath on my neck, his hands on my ass. I moved my body to meet his and felt his hardening cock pressing in my belly, with his hand rubbing the back of my leg. As we kissed, I felt his hands moving over my ass and down to caress my pussy, then up to my shoulders. It felt good to feel his fingers moving between my boobs. He massaged them, massaged them, pinched them and, when he pinched my nipples, I arched my back, feeling him between my legs.</p> <p>He slipped his hand down to my pussy and his fingers entered me effortlessly, making me moan.</p> <p>"Mandy," he said as he pushed a finger into me, and I almost came. I was surprised it didn't hurt, but I was so wet, and my body so excited.</p> <p>"Please," I said, trying to find words.</p> <p>"Please, what?"</p> <p>"Fuck me, my lover, fuck me, please," that was a common thing for me, being spoken by a man. But, for some reason, a man's cock felt so good and big and it felt so natural. I'd heard of women who loved being screwed by big cocks and I wanted it, so I needed him.</p> <p>I turned so he could see my body, standing there in my high heels. He stared at my ass and tits, my pink nipples sticking out and my shaved pussy.</p> <p>"Show me," he said, "open your legs, show me your lips, show me your sexy cunt."</p> <p>I felt like I had to be naked and I looked at him. I was excited, I felt so alive, I felt like a wanton prostitute and he looked at me as I opened my legs.</p> <p>He kneeled between them. "Put that fat cock in me, let me see your beautiful cock fucking me." I couldn't believe I said things like that, but I couldn't resist. I looked at him, so tall, with his cock at six inches and I was bent over a low sofa, and he was fucking me. It felt incredible, I just couldn't get enough of him. His big cock felt so good inside me. I felt like I was going to die, I felt that incredible feeling when I came, and he felt me.</p> <p>My knees were weak and weak, and I leaned against the back of the sofa and he just took me in his arms, his cock inside me and mine on top. I told him how sexy he was, how much he excited me and I wanted him to be with me like that again.</p> <p>He kissed me and we rolled over so I was on my back, and he took his condom from my purse. He turned me onto my stomach and I felt his breath, feel his warm breath, I felt his hard cock push into me from behind and I could feel him enter me so nicely, I felt so full, so tight at once.</p> <p>I told him it was crazy. I said I wanted him. I said I dreamed of him since we first met. I wanted everything from one day to be like this. He fucked me, he took me.</p> <p>My whole body quivered at his touch on meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
