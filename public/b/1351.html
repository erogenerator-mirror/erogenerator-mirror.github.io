"Hello?" she said. "This is Alex. Oh, my husband is going to be home soon; did you not get our reservation?" I listened to the conversation and realized I had forgotten about my "date" and immediately felt embarrassed. I told Alex I would find her later. We had just finished lunch and both had an early class.</p> <p>"Well, don't forget you have my bag in the car," she said sarcastically.</p> <p>"Oh, right, well, I hope you are not disappointed in the number of times you talked," I laughed as the phone rang. When I got to the phone I recognized her deep tone of voice that I had heard before and figured she could use the time to change the locks. The phone did not ring again but I could hear the deep tone every time the bell rang. I picked up and said, "Well, thank you for setting up so easily today," my voice had a note of exasperation and anger to it but also some sense of relief. I smiled as I hung up and put my things away in my car.</p> <p>In the car we started talking and things began to escalate as I became more excited by the minute. She wanted to know how much my son would like to go but I had decided not to tell her. She was right, it would be the easiest thing to accept as a fact that I would be gone for awhile before he was any good. I was certain that if I gave in to her wish for a minute more he would get into a good mood. For the second time today she had come to me in the car and seemed to be genuinely interested in what I had to say to her. I was also sure in that moment I was about to become her husband.</p> <p>She reached over and pulled the cover open and then climbed on top of the gearshift. "What do you think of my surprise present?" she asked as she lifted the hood and slid the visor on. She smiled as she reached out her hand and took my hand in hers. Just at the point where she had moved it up close to my face, she leaned down and kissed my hand. "I am glad you like it, because the next time you see my kids this trip, you will be wondering how I would make it through college." As she said this she began to kiss my arm. I took it and leaned the seat back slightly. "This is really all about fun," I said. She reached her head down, placed it next to mine and kissed me again. I pushed us into the left lane that lead to the hotel. It was a short route and it seemed to go around the corner. It only served to make me want to go and get rid of my hangover but I let it play itself out and we drove to the hotel and went straight to bed. As she pushed me into her as soon as she got off of the bed, I immediately began kissing her. I worked my way down her neck to the collar of her sweatshirt. I began to undo the buttons to her top as my hands were already beginning to move down.</p> <p>She was now standing slightly up and she quickly pulled away from me. I had to make do for a minute with just my hands over her panties but as soon as she was back on the bed I was on her. I moved my hands down and unhooked her bra. She was now wearing a pair of white lace panties but the bottom was almost see-through. I could see the shadow of her outer lips as I lifted my head and kissed her stomach. I took my hands away and pulled her panties down to her ankle. The next thing I felt she had pushed my head onto her sex before pulling my nose close to her pubic area. "Let's make this last," she said as she looked down at me as if trying to decide just how to react. I pushed my tongue out as her knees started to collapse and we rolled off of each other onto the bed. She went down on my crotch and I almost came within seconds. As I was enjoying the sensation of her tongue on my skin, my dick was becoming very hard and I had to adjust it. It was hard not to enjoy the feeling but I had to think about where and what to do next.</p> <p>As she was now on her side next to me, I felt her hand pulling my shirt leg out and begin to push it higher up her leg. I had to make my move and lifted my hips off of the bed as her hand pulled out my penis. "I'm sorry," I said between gasps. "It's not my fault that you aren't getting any relief."</p> <p>She smiled toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
