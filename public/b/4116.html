"I'm sorry...I couldn't help it."</p> <p>"It's okay." She said with a smirk.</p> <p>I laughed. "I didn't take it," I said.</p> <p>She shook her head. "No, I didn't take it. I took the dildo."</p> <p>I smiled and reached to hold out my hand to her. She reached and grasped it and started rubbing it in. As I touched her hair I felt her fingers working the toy over my hair and down my back. She brought my butt toward her. I had no idea where she wanted me to go. I leaned forward again and brought her hand on top of mine to guide it. When I brought her hand over hers I knew she was guiding it into me. She seemed mesmerized by the feeling and I watched as it disappeared into me. I closed my eyes and reveled in her softness.</p> <p>Once I felt myself getting used to it she pulled it out and gave my dick its tip. She held it and slowly jacked me off.

I grabbed my wine and said, "Let's go eat."</p> <p>We had a nice meal with lots of laughter. I told them my schedule for spring break. They were surprised but happy too. We had finished our meals before coming downstairs.</p> <p>"Oh," she said. "I have to go back to my room." She looked at me. "But if you want to come join us for spring break, I don't know what else I can do."</p> <p>"Oh, my God, I couldn't ask for a better time with you. I just need the time to unwind before my roommate comes up tomorrow." I reached under the table for her hand and picked it up. She leaned her forehead on mine as she said, "That's nice of you.
