It's more fun."</p> <p>"I got a question... are you on the pill?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Is this right?" she asked softly, as she began unbuttoning his shirt, as his hands were busy with hers.</p> <p>"Yes." She could almost see the smile in his eyes as she pulled him out of his shirt. She wasn't sure if it was for her benefit, or his. Either way they were going to get off soon, the thought gave her goose bumps. They finished undressing, but he held the bottle open.</p> <p>"I'm not wearing this."</p> <p>"You have to wait and use it. We have to find out how they feel." His words were a little more forceful and they both liked it. She stood him up, and stepped back as she knelt in the water.</p> <p>"I have this." She handed it to him and moved over next to him. They turned so the water could rinse their bodies apart. She was right, it felt great.</p> <p>"I don't have any condoms." She said.</p> <p>"Don't worry about them; we're going to take care of you, you won't get sore or anything."</p> <p>"Oh thank you." She leaned in kiss him, and his lips opened hers. Their tongues probed each other for awhile as their hands roamed over each other. He leaned over and sucked on one of her nipples, it hardened quickly. "A man shouldn't do that unless they are very happy with me." His fingers slid down her belly, past her pants, to her inner thighs. She moaned as they made contact, feeling the warmth flowing through them like water. "Oh...oh."</p> <p>"And the same for you."</p> <p>She stopped kissing him. "I don't want to do anything."</p> <p>"Why not?"</p> <p>"I don't want to feel a woman."</p> <p>"You can never feel a woman; you are not supposed to be intimate."</p> <p>"Oh, come on."</p> <p>"No, I'm not going to do." He kissed her again. It was only to her left. It was right next to her, and he kissed her mouth to her jaw. He trailed his tongue down along her jaw to her neck, and found her nipples. He had always liked them. They were small and perky. He kissed her again, then trailed his tongue around the curve to her chest. There, he found her nipple and drew it into his mouth. He pulled it out and ran his tongue around the hardened nub. He was feeling a little bit excited by this, as he had hoped. He didn't know why, nor did she. She moaned as he circled the nipple with his tongue, flicking the flesh with his tongue.</p> <p>"Oh, that feels good." He was amazed at the sensation his own tongue was feeling. His nipples were harder than he had felt them before and he started to play with them, circling the areola with his tongue. She moaned and pushed her breast harder against his face. He loved the attention and he began to wonder what it would feel like to have her other nipple in his mouth, so he took his hand off her breast.</p> <p>"Let me turn the water." Her hand went down his stomach to his fly. She tugged the leg open, and his jeans slid down his legs to reveal his long and hard dick. She moved in closer as his hand ran the length of her leg. They stopped kissing for a moment and he broke the kiss.</p> <p>"Take off your thong." She sat up abruptly, and looked at him. He laughed. "That was rude."</p> <p>"Please..." he kissed her again, and she melted into his arms. They broke for a second to pull off her pantyhose, and he began to massage her naked bottom with his hand. He felt her body tense up when he did.</p> <p>"Come feel me." She took his hand from her breast and guided it under the elastic of her thong, and down her body. He began to stroke her through the material and she closed her eyes and moaned.</p> <p>"I'm ready."</p> <p>She opened her eyes and looked at him, holding his hand between her legs.</p> <p>"Come, get your dick out." She got on her knees, but turned to the side, and put his dick against her mouth. She began to suck and lick as she slid under his dick and worked her tongue over his balls. She had never done anything like this before and wondered if it really helped.</p> <p>Her finger started to play with his sac. "I think... I think you need something to help the feeling."</p> <p>"That sounds likeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
