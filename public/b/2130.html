"Maybe we can do it again in one weekend."</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess, but I still would have liked to feel him inside of me," she replied.</p> <p>He pushed the plate away and looked at her with a smile. She just looked into his eyes for a moment and then turned back to the stove making sure he was watching. She reached back and squeezed her cheeks with her hands, smiling as she did so. Her cheeks turned red as she reached a fork full of soup. She looked up and saw he was staring at her as she chewed and her cheeks turned the color of coffee. She couldn't help it.</p> <p>"It's time," she said, turning to go back into the kitchen to finish cooking the soup.</p> <p>"Yeah, it's time," Jason said, walking over to her.</p> <p>He put his arms around her, pulling her to him and she leaned back into him. They sat on the bench for a long time, both lost in time. She loved every second of it and she could see that Jason was enjoying it. After a half hour or so of quieting, he said a quick, thank you for being with him tonight and that he would love for her to come back home.</p> <p>Liz returned to the table and sat down. "Well, I guess I better go home now huh?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess so," he said. He pulled his hand out the pocket of his robe and saw that it was full of dishes. He tossed the dishes about and put the dishes in the sink, then reached over to collect the trashcan. He held it up in a high salute and then went back to his table to throw the trash can into the bin.</p> <p>Liz stood up and began to get back into her chair, but Jason grabbed her by the shoulder. He pulled her toward him and pressed his lips to hers. Liz pushed back against his hardness and kissed him back. Finally, she pulled away.</p> <p>"I have to go," she said, looking up at him. She took a towel and put it under his chair, then turned and went into the washroom. Jason turned and watched her walk out the door again. As he watched her, his prick hardened and he gave out a loud groan.</p> <p>"You're one hell of a hot woman, huh?"</p> <p>"Well thank you, but you have to do it all the time. It's just too expensive to waste on a date."</p> <p>"It's just a one-time thing. I'm used to dating a bunch of losers so we can save money." Jason thought for a second and then nodded.</p> <p>"You're right, but if you want to continue like we did, it's okay with me."</p> <p>"Really? I didn't know you were a virgin."</p> <p>"Yeah, me neither," she replied. "Besides, if you want to continue like we did, it's only just a one-time thing."</p> <p>"How's this?"</p> <p>"You're doing it," he said with a grin. "Doing it to the guy you met at the prom. I could have waited, but instead I went over there and did it anyway. Now you're going to be my date every night."</p> <p>"That's cool, Jason. It'd be fun, but it would never be the same if I broke it off."</p> <p>"Yeah, just like I'm not having sex with people I've just met," Jason replied. He smiled as she looked at him, surprised by the comment.</p> <p>"I don't want you to stop."</p> <p>"Oh, please do," he said. He reached out and put his hand on her arm and he started pulling her toward him, then he pushed her out of the washroom and back into the kitchen.</p> <p>They got in the drive-through and got something to eat and then went off to the drive-through and found a table where they had already eaten.</p> <p>About an hour passed before Jason sat down and started to get serious again.</p> <p>"Liz, I don't want you to go through these things again. You're not ready to get back together with me. I think our relationship is on the mend and you need to make some changes, get some dates to go to some parties. We just need to talk then and make it work."</p> <p>"I'll stay in my apartment until you get back," she said. "But I really shouldn't be doing a whole lot of this."</p> <p>"I know, and you're right. But I really need to do what I think is right. I do not want to get between you and Jason."</p> <p>"I don't know why you're talking to me so loudly," she replied withâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
