She said. "When we got here from the office, I had already called everyone to take over the office work." She said pointing to a group of men standing in the lobby. "One other thing," she added. "I don't want the staff of the office to have to take my place. We can all help with that right?"</p> <p>The men looked at each other and nodded.</p> <p>"We'll be back in about ten minutes." They heard Kelly say.</p> <p>"Don't bother doing any work." She said.</p> <p>"I told you it isn't my time."</p> <p>"What was the other thing?" Jack asked. They heard Kelly say. "We can all leave whenever you want to."</p> <p>The women's heads shot up. They knew what Kelly had planned tonight. There would be no going back.</p> <p>Kelly smiled. "No, wait until we get back home. There will be some other work out here."</p> <p>"Well, we are sure going to find that another story out. We'll see."</p> <p>"Okay," the men answered. They walked back to the bar where Steve was waiting for them. They walked in together and each grabbed one of Steve's arms. The women looked shocked and confused. They saw that Steve had his hands in Jack's pockets and his eyes locked on theirs.</p> <p>"I'm sure we will find another story out," Steve said.</p> <p>They walked out the back door. Jack was right, it was now getting late. Kelly and the others were all sitting at the bar sipping at iced tea when Steve walked into the house. He stopped in the kitchen.</p> <p>"Hey guys," Steve said as he sat down with Steve.</p> <p>"Steve! You know something? About the new car?" Kelly said.</p> <p>"Tell me about it," Steve said. He leaned back and studied the car. "Well, I want you to know we're in my hands. This has been a very fun evening." He said with a sad smile. "So, have you got a nice car?"</p> <p>The men all looked at the driver. He was staring at his watch. The time was 6pm, they didn't know how long Kelly and the others would be gone at this time. They waited for Steve to answer.</p> <p>"Do we get to know her better now?" Kelly said. "Do we get to know her better too?" She asked pointing to the car.</p> <p>Jack and the others were all nodding their heads. "Well, we will see. But it seems like we are the only ones that have the balls to come into the kitchen and find out who had taken advantage of us and how to punish them." Steve said.</p> <p>"How about right now?" Kelly asked. Jack smiled. He looked around the kitchen and shrugged.</p> <p>"Sure do. Why not?" Steve said.</p> <p>"What about you? What am I supposed to do with you guys if we keep you waiting like that." Kelly said. They laughed as they all took turns checking each other out.</p> <p>"This seems to be a good idea." One said. "We can't have you all thinking we put you in a hurry when we already have our work over."</p> <p>Jack smiled and walked over. He picked up Steve and kissed him. Their lips met and they were instantly taken into a kissing frenzy. The kiss was strong and long. Steve was quickly being turned on by the attention Steve was paying to his lips. When he pulled away, he looked into Kelly's eyes; "You are very lucky." He grinned.</p> <p>"I guess I could have had that. I can't remember any guy ever getting as horny as you did that night."</p> <p>Steve couldn't resist kissing Jack some more. It was so much better than what he had with Kelly the night before. "We can fix this." Steve said. "When we get home, you'll have your turn with me." He leaned in and kissed Jackie.</p> <p>Jack had a quick mental flashback. On the way home that night Kelly had been telling him that if he gave her a good fuck she could forget anything until they got home to her. She was right. The next morning when the car was parked in the garage the only one left in the garage was his. They drove their car in to the house. When the door was closed, they all stood there in the kitchen looking at each others faces.</p> <p>"I'll fix that for you, when we get home." Steve said and started to walk out of the kitchen with Steve. He held his hand out to Kelly.</p> <p>"Wait." He said. "You want to keep me company? I haven't been with a woman for months." He grinned as he reached outâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
