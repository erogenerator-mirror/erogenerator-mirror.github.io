She moaned and leaned back against his chest, allowing him full access to her body. He leaned forward and kissed her belly-button, and she arched her back, sliding up his body so she could rub her pussy against his cock as it slid against his thigh. He slid his cock up and down her slit, rubbing it against her opening, feeling it slide inside her and filling her up.</p> <p>Her head was leaning against the back of the bench, her fingers digging into it, and moaned again as he entered her with another of his fingers. He grabbed her hands, sliding them over her chest and holding her against him, and slid his hand around her neck, holding her in place while he slid his prick inside her.</p> <p>She closed her eyes and moaned, then let them close and focus on him. She moved her hips in small circles, feeling every inch of him slide in and out of her. And he moved his hips in return.</p> <p>“God, that feels so good,” she sighed. “I want you in me so, so bad.”</p> <p>“That’s not a question;” he responded, and thrust harder. “I want to fill your sweet body, make you mine,” he cried. “I love feeling my cock slide into you, filling you.”</p> <p>A soft cry escaped the back of her throat. She felt he was already ready to cum. She squeezed her internal muscles around him, squeezing around the feeling of him filling her. Her juices leaked all over his cock as the feelings of pleasure overcame her.</p> <p>“OH YES!” she cried, lifting her hips up against his, meeting his cock with her body. They rocked as one, his dick pumping hard up into her, rubbing her clit with every thrust. Her pussy contracted and squeezed around him as she came, her muscles gripping him tight.</p> <p>It took several moments for the pleasure to subside, until he was still. She collapsed against him, both of them caught in the moment. And when he did, it was at the same moment that he felt her body begin to relax, knowing that her orgasm was still fresh.</p> <p>“I’m sorry,” she whispered, breaking free from his embrace to look up at him. “I hope I didn’t make you feel neglected.”</p> <p>“It did nothing for me. It was all my strength for that,” he smiled, reaching down to kiss her. “Come here, and I’ll take care of you.”</p> <p>As he turned to lead her upstairs, she leaned over and kissed him on the cheek, then whispered to him, “There’s something you need to do, before we’re done.”</p> <p>* * * * * * * *</p> <p>“Can I tell my friends what happens at your friend’s wedding the week before?” a voice asked. She and Jeff had talked several times over the past few months to see if they had time. They ended up doing it, and talked for hours about it. But now he decided to do it himself, and it wasn’t just anyone. No, his friend, a young woman named Michelle, was going to her friend's wedding. There was nothing special going on, just the two of them being there was.</p> <p>When she spoke, it seemed to come out of her own mouth, and she had a nervous smile on her face. He was the one who called her and told her it would be a good day to see her.</p> <p>“Don’t worry,” he replied. “They’ll let me know the details. They don’t want too many people to know what goes on.” But what he didn’t say was that Michelle’s friend was going to be there too.</p> <p>“Well, Michelle’s wedding is here,” the person on the other end said, her voice trailing off into the background. She had been hoping that she had brought her best friend, and maybe they could go together.</p> <p>“She sounds like you two already know her from talking,” the younger one on the other end of the conversation said. Her voice was husky, and made Jeff’s stomach clench almost painfully. “I don’t know if it would be a coincidence for her to be there as well, but I’m not sure what’s going on.”</p> <p>“I could help you out,” Jeff offered.</p> <p>“No, we can’t talk about this at the reception,”—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
