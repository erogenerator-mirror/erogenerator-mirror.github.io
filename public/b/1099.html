If you're gonna stay here, we're going to have to walk back, right?"</p> <p>I nodded. He gave me that look.</p> <p>"Well it is not nice to leave without saying goodbye."</p> <p>"No... I can't." I said softly.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I said.</p> <p>"I know. Just... I want you to stay. I've been thinking of you all night."</p> <p>"You what?" I asked surprised. I'd been trying to stay quiet. It was the first time in our relationship I was able to get a glimpse of him. He was so different than any guy I'd slept with since high school. Maybe he was just my age or maybe not. It couldn't be that simple he had his hair cut the same style as my short and the clothes he'd worn, but he was a sexy stud.</p> <p>"I thought you didn't want me anymore. I don't..."</p> <p>"It's ok," he said. His voice was calm and he reached across the table and took my hand. "Let me take care of you."</p> <p>That word seemed to make me jump a bit. He lifted me onto the counter, he knelt down beside me, and took the hem of my skirt and slid it up over my ass. I was wearing pantyhose and a little bit of cotton from the hose I'd just put on. It still felt nice, but it looked like I wasn't wearing any panties.</p> <p>He grabbed me by the waist and lifted me up to look in the mirror.</p> <p>"Wow," I said, "I'm so happy you came to me." The words just rolled off my tongue. He pulled me face to face. Our eyes met. He pulled me up so he could look in the mirror again. I'd never done anything like that before, but I'd wanted to do it so bad I could hardly stand the suspense. I didn't look at him. I really wanted this. He ran his hands down my arms and up my back. I felt his soft, warm hands gently massage my body as he walked me to the living room. He pulled me towards him and pulled me gently onto him. He was now lying on his back and I was straddled on his lap. We slowly started to grind against each other. He started to run his hands over my body as he rubbed his palms on both sides of my body. We didn't speak a word. I just stared at himself in the mirror. I felt like a total mess. Our eyes were closed and our lips touched, but I couldn't bring myself to look into his eyes.</p> <p>He brought his lips down to my ear and whispered. "I want you... tonight." His voice was so smooth and seductive. That look in his voice scared me so much I thought he was making me feel like a complete whore. I'd never acted like that before, but I couldn't take it. I'm not a slut, but this was too much for me to resist. I looked into those sparkling, dark eyes and he brought his head down to mine and kissed me deeply. We kissed for what seemed like an eternity, but all I remember is the softness of that passion and the promise of my first kiss. I reached up and grabbed him by the collarbone as we kissed.</p> <p>"Let's go to my bedroom," he said, "but remember, I'm not here..."</p> <p>We reached the bedroom and as he closed the door behind us I turned to look him in the eyes which were so much softer than they were. We were both so turned on. I slowly undid his shirt as I stared into his eyes. The moment I was holding his gaze, I was so close to him that I could feel his hardness press against me. He was right in the middle of us, right on top of me, and I could feel his chest against my back. It felt heavenly. A rush of adrenaline rushed though my body. I unzipped his pants to my hand and felt his bulging crotch. I didn't waste any time in pulling them down, only to be pushed back against the wall by one of his hands. Then I felt the cool air rushing against my bare skin.</p> <p>"Oh my god," I whispered as I moved in for another kiss. His hands were roaming all over my body and I was moaning to my toes as we kissed. His lips were like silk and it was as sensual as I remembered to be at the same time. He ran his hand down my body, over my pants and my panties, then moved his hand down towards my pussy. I raised my hips to his finger trying to get it inside me. I felt like it was the right thing, and I definitely didn't want to hurt him. His finger entered me andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
