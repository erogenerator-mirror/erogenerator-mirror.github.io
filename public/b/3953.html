We have a lot of work to do, and I just know I need to feel comfortable and to see my son."</p> <p>"Are you sure about that?"</p> <p>"I'm sure. I just wanted to warn you."</p> <p>"Okay. So I can be sure?"</p> <p>"Yes," she said as she smiled at me. "This is going to be fun!"</p> <p>There was a knock at the door.</p> <p>As I answered, Julie got up and led me to the door. At the door she looked directly into my eyes.</p> <p>"If you want this apartment, call," she said softly with a smile. Looking me right in the eyes, she added, "Just remember, I want my love so much, that I can't wait to put it in your hands. I just hope you find everything you need to as exciting as we did for so many years."</p> <p>"I would," I replied as I reached out and picked up the card with our telephone number. I was already shaking with excitement as I knocked once more with the key in hand to the door. Julie opened the door, with a wicked smile.</p> <p>"Come on in, baby," she said as she stood back to let me enter the apartment. As soon as I was inside the apartment, Julie motioned toward my apartment.</p> <p>"I'm sure we are ready for some real fun tonight, now." She said with a smile as she took my hand and led me straight to the bedroom. Once there, she closed and locked the door. I could feel her eyes on me as a small smile came across her face. My heart raced as she turned quickly over against me.</p> <p>"I told you I know how to turn you both on, didn't I?" she whispered in my ear as her hands ran slowly down my body to my crotch, where it quickly became soaked.</p> <p>"Yes," I breathed as my hand went to her exposed breasts under the top of her negligee.</p> <p>"You sure can," she cooed softly as she ran her fingers through my hair, as she lifted my face to her, a question in her eyes.</p> <p>"I am sure," I replied as I kissed her hard on the mouth gently and responded the warm embrace. I slipped another finger up inside her.</p> <p>"That's your name." I answered smiling.</p> <p>"Tommy?" she asked as she pulled her hand away from my crotch with my juices trickling down the inside of one hand. She reached to my crotch with the other, and slowly pulled my hand out of her robe. I could now feel her fingers wrapped around my now hard cock as they gently teased my cock with her hand. I moved my hand up the inside of her thigh and then over her pussy lips.</p> <p>"You know I don't have any panties on," she said with a little devilish smile.</p> <p>"Yes, I know. Do you want me to do it for you?"</p> <p>"Yes," she groaned as her thighs closed around my hand. "But, before we do anything, would you please make love to me?"</p> <p>"God yes," I replied as I slipped my fingers back to where they had been. Julie groaned as I slipped my fingers back inside her and then back out. In her own personal space, she was incredibly wet; I could hear and feel her body quiver as I fingered her body.</p> <p>"I need you to fuck me," she moaned huskily. "Fuck my hot pussy with your big cock!"</p> <p>"Oh, Tommy," she whispered in my ear. "I want you right now."</p> <p>I quickly undid my shorts and quickly pushed them to the floor. My swollen and rigid cock sprung up as I saw her wet and waiting. Julie had removed her robe completely and had the bed over her shoulders and was straddling me as she sat on the bed.</p> <p>"Please," she continued. "Fuck me."</p> <p>I positioned myself and put my hands on her sides and moved my cock right up inside her. Julie let out a little squeal as my cock moved slowly up inside her body.</p> <p>"It's so hard," she said. "You feel so good."</p> <p>"I know," I replied smiling with my eyes locked on hers. "It just makes it even thicker."</p> <p>I placed my hands on each side of her body as I began to move slowly, pulling out with each thrust of my cock. I could see the passion in her eyes as she watched me intently. After a few moments, I began to speed up as I saw her thighs tense and relax around my hips as my pace began to increase.</p> <p>"Harder," she whispered. "HARDER!"</p> <p>The words sent another bolt of electricity throughâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
