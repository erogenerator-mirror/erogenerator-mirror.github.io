Jason asked.</p> <p>"It's just that I think you might be exaggerating!" He said in a surprised tone. "And you don't even know what you're going to do. You're a stupid piece of shit! I should probably just go to bed!" He said as he rose to his feet and went over to the bathroom.</p> <p>"I'll be up in a sec." He called out to Rebecca while I put the laptop down and walked back into the room. Jason had a towel wrapped around his waist and his robe was pulled over his shoulders.</p> <p>"Oh... Hi Jason!" I replied. "How are you?"</p> <p>"I'm fine. Have a seat in the living room and I'll be up in a few."</p> <p>He set the laptop on the coffee table and walked over to the couch. He put his arm around my shoulder and rested his cheek on the upper slope of my breast.</p> <p>"Jason, you're a good looking man, it's just that I'm just a girl. I've always been pretty independent and I don't know... I don't know. Do you?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm just really shy," Jason stated. "I wouldn't feel right about letting anybody but you know."</p> <p>This was a turn toward a conversation he probably wanted to avoid but he had trouble talking it through. He took a sip of water as he thought about his girlfriend's description of the girl he was dating back then. Then he realized that if Jason was dating a girl that he felt it wouldn't be cheating on her. "Okay, so what's the first thing you're interested in?"</p> <p>"This is going to be a little awkward." he muttered, looking away and thinking about sex.</p> <p>"I think it'll be great." I said.</p> <p>"I'm sure this is a lot to take in..." he muttered as he turned to face me. The towel that had been covering his crotch slowly fell away from his waist and I could see the bulge that was rising in his jeans. I tried not to stare...</p> <p>"Do you still feel like you need to talk?" I snapped, making small talk about our relationship and wanting to change the subject.</p> <p>"I guess... I dunno..." He replied.</p> <p>I looked at him and then looked back down at his crotch.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, that was a very bold statement," I said, trying to avoid looking at anything but his crotch.</p> <p>Jason looked back up at me and I saw he was flushed with embarrassment. Looking at him again and then back down at his penis I said, "I think you need to take care of it some."</p> <p>"I... I'll stay right here..." He stammered. He then leaned his head down and his mouth opened revealing the tip of his penis. I stared at him in shock of what he had unleashed. I'd had sex with someone else and it's never been like this, but at the moment Jason was only my boyfriend, not the guy I just slept with.</p> <p>"You said..." I started to say.</p> <p>"I did." Jason told me.</p> <p>With Jason looking down at his dick, I felt a surge of sexual excitement. My boyfriend had been flaccid since our last time. Since he was so young I didn't masturbate much, but I wondered if it was due to me being with someone younger than I was. It was a wonder I hadn't cum or gotten aroused while watching Jason masturbate. I glanced down at his flaccid penis and then back up at him. "Let me do you..." I asked.</p> <p>"Okay!" Jason replied.</p> <p>I knelt in front of him, placing a hand on his chest and then began kissing his inner thigh. I inched myself up toward his lap and got a good view of the tip of his penis. Jason's eyes were closed and his head was back against the headrest. It looked almost obscene.</p> <p>"Oh, my God!" I whispered, looking at the glistening tip of his cock.</p> <p>Rebecca stepped into the room, her backside close to Jason's lap. I stood up, walking directly over Jason's lap and putting my arms around Rebecca's waist. His penis was now up against my stomach but I could barely feel it. Jason pushed his hips up, trying to escape from my embrace. My erection pressing against his stomach turned him on immensely, making his penis start to stiffen even more.</p> <p>"I'll put my arms around your neck," I told Rebecca. I then leaned down toward Jason, leaning my body right on top of his. My lips locked with kisses on his neck and his ear. I could feel his muscles twitchâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
