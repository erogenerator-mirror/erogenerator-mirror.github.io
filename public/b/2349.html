I lifted my hips up and rubbed myself against him, grinding myself against him.</p> <p>"Ohh fuck!" he cried out, his cock buried deep in my tight wetness, our hips both moving and bucking back and forth.</p> <p>"Fuck!" I growled like a beast, thrusting back at him; "Now it's your turn!"</p> <p>And I did. We shifted onto the bed, me on top of him, and we drove ourselves together, the friction and passion rising from both of us. It was no longer just a simple matter of moving together. There was an animal lust, a primal want to satisfy even more than humanly possible.</p> <p>I pressed my full firm breasts to his chest and held onto him like a lover, using the leverage of our lust together. The motion was powerful and all of my energy radiated out into him and we rode together in a wave of sensual and primal passion.</p> <p>I leaned forward and grabbed his face and pulled him down until we could kiss and rub at each other.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum, baby!" I shouted out from above, as I lowered myself back to him.</p> <p>He groaned loudly and I knew it wouldn't end. My climax came in waves and it exploded around me. For a moment I felt like we had become one body, like there was no place but in him. The friction of our flesh and the pulsing passion of it all was like a spark of electricity.</p> <p>I was panting and moaning. I was close. I gripped him so hard he was in pain and I moved up, taking him in my mouth as I began to feel myself go off.</p> <p>"Yes!" I bellowed, as I felt myself go into my second orgasm of the day.</p> <p>He kissed me and we moved onto the bed again, and this time I started riding him as I was on top. I couldn't believe how intense he felt in me, and I couldn't believe how much I wanted this! I couldn't believe I could get this far with a man. I could've been in love with my dad since I was 14 years old, when I still had some of his body. Oh God, I thought. But I loved it, and I love this man with every fiber of my being; not as if I were his. Oh no, I thought, not at all!</p> <p>He didn't say much during the ride home; we talked, we fucked, talked. There was nothing passionate or sexy that we didn't say. This was a feeling I had never really expected of any man. There is a certain comfort in being in love, knowing it's real. A feeling I don't think I ever would've imagined of any other person. Yet here I was about to make love with my man. I had to feel like a slut to the rest of the world, to him.</p> <p>As the ride up to our house got longer, I kept on riding him. I really wanted him to get off inside me as soon as possible, and I didn't think I could manage another second of him.</p> <p>When we arrived home, my mom was worried that she had gotten pregnant. She said it was the last thing she heard her husband say about his father, and she did try to get him to see it as soon as she could.</p> <p>The thought of him seeing it as soon as possible did something to me. So much that I started to think about how it might have been if I had let him see it the way he had never did. I didn't want to tell him, but in the back of my mind I could feel, and the feelings that I had toward him were making it hard to think.</p> <p>We got to our house. I said I would go in the house to shower, and make sure everything was spotless and clean. I went down the hall to the bathroom, and as I opened the door, in the corner by the bed was my little room.</p> <p>I shut the door behind me and moved to the shower. I put my hands under the water and let the water wash over me. Soap ran off the sides of my body and down my breasts. The water was cool, but not cold. I let the water massage my stomach gently and I felt me get warmer. I soaped myself all over, rubbing soap into all of my naked body, from my stomach, down to my legs (I still had a pair not too long after I got my tubes tied), and even down my ass and between them.</p> <p>Then I washed myself in the mirror, and I could see I was looking at myself.</p> <p>"You're beautiful," I said to myselfâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
