You can't."</p> <p>"No, I couldn't. If you'd just come on one of my flights, we'd be alone."</p> <p>"I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm pretty sure you haven't. I guess you can't even say you did it once, and it was too late."</p> <p>"Well, I didn't take any chances. I was just so drunk."</p> <p>"So, I don't believe that I could take chances." He laughed.</p> <p>He reached down and pulled the straps of his robe forward and helped himself into it. He reached down and ran his fingers over the material of his robe, and pulled it up over his body. With one last look down at his exposed flesh, he slipped the robe off and threw it across the room. He sat down again, crossed his legs and reached down to take off his shoes. When he came back to the foot of the bed, he was already out. "Now you're going to have to come back and change your clothes."</p> <p>He smiled, "I couldn't go back."</p> <p>"You can," he said.</p> <p>He walked to the bathroom, opened the door and stepped inside. He didn't see anybody else with the door closed; he assumed that it had to have been someone else in the room. He felt no need to look around; everyone in the room could see his body. He walked to the bathroom door and took a deep breath, closed his eyes and opened his mouth to catch a few droplets of pee. When he saw himself in the full length mirror, he stared at himself in surprise. He looked like a very pretty young girl...</p> <p>He couldn't be. He was...a girl.</p> <p>It was as if his body made a decision. He had to look, or else he'd have to do something to change his life. And he had made a decision. He turned to leave. "I'm sorry, Jim. I guess you can't do what I would have asked of you. Do anything."</p> <p>Jim didn't hear the words, but they carried on as if he was talking to a child. He turned and left the bathroom, leaving the door open as he went.</p> <p>Later that night, Jim and Lisa walked past the living room door. "We were just passing by the bar, Jim," Lisa said. "We're going to eat...something before we go to bed, aren't we?"</p> <p>"No, I think that we've got the night."</p> <p>He laughed, "No, that's wrong. It's our evening."</p> <p>"I knew that, Jim. I know that. You don't have to do anything," Lisa said.</p> <p>"That's not true. I think that I could let you go home with a hard on and not have to watch my face for the rest of the night. I think that I would love to watch you masturbate. Then, that way, we could do something that I wouldn't do if things didn't already happen."</p> <p>"If things do happen," Jim added.</p> <p>"I think that a girl is supposed to go into the bathroom when she gets in trouble, not to get herself in trouble."</p> <p>"I think that I could be persuaded," Jim said, thinking about it.</p> <p>Later that night Lisa and Jim were having their first serious date. "Why don't you come in my room?" Jim asked. He took the chance to look at the bathroom door and check it out.</p> <p>He turned to see if the coast was clear. There was not a light on, but inside the bathroom was a bathroom full of toiletries. "I don't think that there is a man in here," he thought.</p> <p>"Well, if there was, it wouldn't matter because there is a man in here," he answered.</p> <p>"Come on. I want to go out to dinner and have a good time. I need to get rid of this feeling."</p> <p>Jim looked over, surprised by his answer, "There's only one way to go out. I guess it's that way." He laughed, "It's just that, you know."</p> <p>"I don't understand. You're right. I'm drunk, and I'm sure that it's not my fault. I'm a man, Jim. There's nothing wrong with that."</p> <p>Jim walked out back and stopped at the doorway. "Look Jim, I'm okay. Not drunk, I guess, but I was a little horny, and I've got to go back to the room and change."</p> <p>As he got to his feet he noticed that he had a very hard cock.
