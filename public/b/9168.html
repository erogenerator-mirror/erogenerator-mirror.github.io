It wasn't long before she was grinding her clit against me while I began to fuck her. I leaned her against the wall, my hands on her boobs, and began to really get into it, feeling her shiver under my touch. She began to bounce harder and faster, her legs shaking, nails digging into my back.</p> <p>Then came a scream, a wail of sorts and one of the most amazing orgasms I have ever experienced. My cock throbbed in her as I emptied my load into her. Neither of us could stand it any longer, and I rolled us over so that my back was to the door. We had not fucked like this in ages. I wrapped my arms around her and we both let out a sigh, and turned to go. But before we could my eyes were tearing.</p> <p>"W... wh... what a fuck!"</p> <p>***</p> <p>I felt it all start to fade away, and I began to realize that I really had loved this, as much as she had. But now I knew that maybe this was a mistake; I could not be with another woman, even just once. I couldn't be with another wife, of an older woman. I could not be with a married man. I couldn't be with a beautiful naked woman. So I just went to the bathroom, grabbed a towel, washed my face, and left. That night I slept like the dead. And the next time I slept my thoughts started coming back to me.</p> <p>I didn't know what I felt for her. I guess that it's because I didn't know. I had been with a strange woman. I was not attracted to her sexually. I didn't know what to think, to feel, how it felt, to actually respond. I guess that I just sort of got carried away. I was in a situation I had not been in in years; a situation I was too scared to admit such a thing. Was it wrong? Was it too late? Was I too much of a coward? Or had I just lost my courage? I didn't think so. The next day I got back to the cottage, dried off, put on some sweats and went looking for Marie.</p> <p>When I got in my room, Marie was sitting at her bed, naked and with my cum still on her thighs. Marie was also naked and looking a little flushed. She said the scene was exciting. I kissed her face and her eyes. She kissed me. Now she looked as beautiful as ever, maybe more so. She pulled my sweatshirt off over my shirt and kissed me there. Then she looked me in the eye, took my pants off, and took my cock in her hands. She was stroking me until I was hard as a rock. Then she climbed on top of me and slowly slid on and began to fuck me. It was heaven. She didn't seem to want to rush me - probably she had already had too much to drink and already she just wanted to give me a chance to be with her. Then she slid her pussy down on me. The feeling was amazing. She went up and down, slowly with just the head in and just as she began to ride me up I felt my orgasm start to build. I grabbed her bum, and she arched her body and lifted her bottom off my cock, and I cried out, "Oh Marie, I'm going to come."</p> <p>She stopped, got off me, stood up and went over to my side of my bed. I don't know if this was my normal reaction to sex, or what. Whatever it was, she went over to her dresser and threw something into a bag, along with a condom. "Do I need to explain this to you?" she asked me. "No, honey, it's all right."</p> <p>She then took one out of the bag, which was sitting on the bed, and handed it to me. "Please wear these," she said, putting them on, then turning herself toward me. "Take off the rest of the clothes," she said, as she took out the condom. "And put this on," she said, as she handed me the packet, then bent over and put one foot on the bed. I took the condom and slid the condom along her leg with my cock in my hand.</p> <p>Then she reached out to my cock and took the condom from my hand and put it on it. She then took the condom and handed it to me. Then she took me in her mouth for a minute or two, and began to move me in and out, her pussy still very tight around my cock, and I started to come. She was sucking on me like a baby feeding. But when I felt my orgasm I stopped her and reached around her and grabbed her ass, forcing her to suck me harder on my cock. I could tell she loved itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
