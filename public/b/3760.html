I thought about some of the stories I'd read, but nothing really came to my mind. He moved closer, so that his cock was rubbing against my slit, and then I felt his fingers on my labia.</p> <p>"You are very wet." I said softly.</p> <p>"Your mouth is wonderful, very wet. I feel like I am in heaven. And here," he said, trailing his hand along the wetness, "I think I love your taste."</p> <p>"I love it, too," I said. I took his hand and kissed his finger deeply. I tasted my essence, and felt a slight tingle.</p> <p>"Come to my bed."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Come when I am ready."</p> <p>He picked me up, laid me gently down on the bed, and went to go get a condom and some warm lubricant. He laid on the bed, propped himself up on one arm and looked me in the eye.</p> <p>"Open your legs. Let me see what you are hiding. I want to see your beautiful cunny."</p> <p>I did as he ordered, and he reached down, took the condom, squeezed it, and rolled it onto his cock. I knew what he wanted - and I told him so. He positioned the end at my opening, and then slowly fed it into me. He paused, watching a thin droplet of my saliva trickle from my lips to my clitoris, and then continued the slow and steady feeding. He told me to close my legs, and I did, pulling my ankles up so my feet were touching my ears.</p> <p>"Good. Now, I want you to get on your knees, facing me so I can get the tip in. I love it when a woman holds my cock in her mouth."</p> <p>I was so turned-on that it took less than a minute of him pumping into me to make me feel all of the sensations that had built up around me when his tongue and mouth and fingers had teased me. I wanted more. I wanted to feel him touching me in ways I hadn't felt before, and it felt wonderful.</p> <p>Once I felt his cock starting to move in and out, I relaxed my muscles until it could just start moving against my stomach again, and let him do it all out. I was on my own again when I felt an object pressing against my ass, and I looked down. He was lubricating me with a little gel.</p> <p>I looked back at him. He had his hands on my hips, pulling me back toward him. As he did, I felt him slowly penetrating me. All the stimulation I had felt earlier was being replaced with the feel of his cock, sliding in, out, and then withdrawing a little more slowly. I didn't really know what to expect from what I felt, what it might be. But just as I thought I would go wild with it, I felt his body tensing, his breath, and then, when I felt him start to ejaculate into me, another orgasm swept through me: one of pure joy and ecstasy at the pure ecstasy, one of knowing that I had given my body to a man I had known only as a boy.</p> <p>I'm sure I had a shocked look on my face, but it quickly turned to a look of pure elation and satisfaction. I think I would have come by just feeling it, or maybe even having my own orgasm - whichever came first. I never felt so completely satisfied with anything in my life.</p> <p>Finally, after a while, he pulled out and lay next to me. We were both breathing heavily.</p> <p>"You are so beautiful. I could really do with a few minutes to get everything out of this."</p> <p>"I would never cheat on Daddy. I don't even think this is the same man I fucked."</p> <p>"I'm sorry to be wrong, but if I had been, it would have been a much more difficult time. Maybe you could have stayed and got me off at the same time, so to speak."</p> <p>"Thank you. You are very lovely."</p> <p>"You're wonderful," I said as I closed my eyes.</p> <p>We lay there a few minutes, enjoying the feel of our bodies on each other. I was so happy and content, and felt as if I could never fall asleep.</p> <p>"If we had gotten to this point, I don't imagine I would have made it this way."</p> <p>"But if things worked out, I think there were things that I'd love for you to find for me."</p> <p>"Like what?"</p> <p>"I'm sure there are things you could find for me that I want - things I would have never thought of myself.
