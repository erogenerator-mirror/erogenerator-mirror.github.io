The world he'd been living in finally started to move around him. He reached up to touch her, and then she was gone.</p> <p>He found himself back in his room, looking at her face. He wanted to look at everything in her that was right before him. He wanted to find a way to have her again. There were other things he had wanted to do with his life that he'd never thought of. But that wasn't what he wanted.</p> <p>He wanted to take his time, to find her. To make love to her, to have sex with her. But he knew he couldn't. Even the thought of it would bring back to him all the pain and the guilt and the rejection, and he wanted to forget her even now.</p> <p>What he missed, and what he needed to do was to do it over again.</p> <p>It was late in the day, and he was thinking about his day as he usually did. What he'd been doing wasn't going anywhere. He'd finished his day, and he was going on home. At least for a year.</p> <p>He thought about his life, and he didn't like what he'd been doing with himself. He hated being that man. He hated taking care of himself. He hated being a coward, and he hated having to choose what to do. He thought about his life, and what he'd wanted and what he wasn't. And then he realized something. Just then he opened his mouth to talk.</p> <p>"Hey."</p> <p>He got up, walked up to the counter and reached over to turn the lock. He didn't think much about whether she was out or not, and he wasn't looking forward to that either. He just wanted to say something.</p> <p>"Hey." Her voice came with each one. "How was your day? I haven't seen you much in," she finished.</p> <p>"Good," he replied. He didn't see her for a long time. It was easier now that he had her. He just watched her as she was walking back toward him.</p> <p>There was nothing more he wanted to do right then, other than to be inside her again. She seemed to be happy. Even though they'd been together for years, she still seemed so happy.</p> <p>"You ok?" he asked.</p> <p>She shook her head, and he realized then that she hadn't come back down to the kitchen to fix breakfast for him.</p> <p>"Nuh-uh. You've had a rough day today. What's up?" she asked. "And don't worry about it. I don't want to push you into something we haven't seen. Do you want me to go back down and wash you off? That's ok. I can wash you off, but I'll be right back. Do you know if there's any food I can make you have? I've got some of those things at your place."</p> <p>She laughed. "That's what I like about you," she said. "I have a plate of things you can make yourself. I'm sure you can get all the proper ingredients I know there."</p> <p>"I'll see you later," he said. "Thank you."</p> <p>He walked out the door and headed back home to his dorm. He didn't want to be alone with the emotions that were going down. And he didn't really want to be alone. He didn't want that. He got home and went over to her place. He sat on the couch and held his hand out to her. He wanted to be with her.</p> <p>He tried to put off his disappointment for a moment, and then he got up to take that plate of things she'd left behind. He pulled out the food for himself, and she got the last plate. They ate together, and he kept talking about the things he'd been doing with just her.</p> <p>"I missed you so much," she said, "I wanted to give you one last chance to be happy with me." Then she smiled. "Thank you for everything you're done for today."</p> <p>He sat back and watched as her beautiful face flashed before his eyes. He wanted to look into those eyes, but he found it hard to look away.</p> <p>She looked down at her plate and she felt so beautiful. "I can't wait to come home again," she said. "You're not the only one going through the same thing."</p> <p>"I'm sorry about that, but I've learned."</p> <p>She smiled a little at his attempt at comfort. "Then it's ok. Everything else will go before things get back to normal."</p> <p>Her smile left her lips and she hugged him to himself. He could feel her tears on his shoulder as he held her close to him.
