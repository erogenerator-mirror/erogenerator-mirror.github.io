I turned my head and smiled as I asked, "What kind of massage is it again, lover boy? I know you like to feel me up, right?" My hands massaged his shoulders, back, and ass as I said, "A lot." I had my hands on the sides of his legs, and I leaned in close, so that he could see and smell my perfume wafting around him. I then turned my head, moved back toward him, and asked, "Does that mean you liked your massages, lover boy?" I moved back a hair and looked at his face briefly, then back at his body, then said, "I have to ask this from your own point of view. I want to be sure that you really enjoyed yourself with that massage."</p> <p>And I did! I liked it! It was a turn-on to have someone in my fantasies. I was so turned on it was incredible. We were in a hallway in one corner of the library, and I led him into the next room. My body tingled as I felt myself becoming excited again. Our first time in the room was so wonderful. He was very respectful, and never rushed about anything. He even walked with me so smoothly, and that was such a thrill to me. I felt confident for the next part.</p> <p>We got out of our clothes and set them on a chair, and then proceeded to get into a 69 position, lying on our sides in a 69 position. He took it to a new level. He pushed my legs apart and licked his way up toward my pussy.</p> <p>"Lube me up for you, lover," I ordered.</p> <p>He spread my legs and brought his right hand to my pout for a better angle, and I reached for his hard cock to stroke up and down as my mouth and lips worked over him. I could feel his hand move in behind me, and I moved the tip of his cock to my pussy hole. We stayed like that until he pulled back enough to say that he needed access to my ass and pussy, and I moved to let him. After we'd done this several times, I asked him what he wanted me to do.</p> <p>"A lot," he said.</p> <p>"I want you to do it to my ass, man. That would be nice," I said, thinking of the other way he'd be using it.</p> <p>"OK," and I started back for what he wanted me to do.</p> <p>He knelt down a little, but I thought he wasn't gonna kiss me. He was looking at my pussy, which was getting wetter by the second. We were looking at each other like a pair of hungry animals. He took his hand and started touching my pussy lightly with what looked like a little dab of lubrication, but I didn't really feel it as he continued his way down. He put his hand where I wanted it, and I knew I'd be ready to be penetrated. He got closer, but kept moving away from me. I knew this was his chance.</p> <p>"It's okay," I said. "I want him to know how much I really meant it."</p> <p>At that moment I felt his finger enter me. "That's it, babe. You wanted this, right?"</p> <p>"Yes, yes, I did," I said, as if I wanted to stay in a dream.</p> <p>"I can't wait to fuck you, so put it in," he said, and he turned and kissed me as his finger pumped back and forth, causing me to moan with passion. "You know I love you like this," he said to me, "and you know that you'll keep saying it to me, too. Let's keep getting better, OK? Okay, baby? Just trust me."</p> <p>With that, he put his finger all the way in with no pressure, and started pumping. It wasn't long before I got used to it, as we talked about everything we wanted to do with each other, and we found that we really enjoyed it. It wasn't a good first for me, but it had the right affect on his dick. It took a few moments for him to come, and that wasn't too bad either. As good as this position was, we didn't finish. We kissed one more time, and left to go to sleep. We did it in a quick moment. I'm not quite sure how many times we fucked, but that's a story for another time.</p> <p>The next day, I was up early in my bedroom and started masturbating furiously. The thought of what he would do again, and how it would be the same treatment I'd given him for so long, was just too much to even imagine. I came so hard that I had to be careful notâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
