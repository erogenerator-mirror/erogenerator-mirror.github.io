Oh my God!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!! Oh my fucking God!!! Oh my fucking God!!!!! Oh my fucking God!!!!! I'm cumming!!! Goddddd!!!!!! Ahhhhhhhh!!!!"</p> <p>My pussy started to spasm as I held my orgasm in complete control of my body. It started in my stomach and spread outward from my ass cheeks into the top of my head as my whole body shivered. Then all that was left was my orgasmic release. My cunt spasmed and quaked with each wave of pleasure that rocked my entire body.</p> <p>My orgasm seemed to last forever and I held my position as if it would break the air. A little wave then subsided and I felt her release the pressure of her pussy on my finger. She sat there holding my head like he was an anchor and I held her tight as my body continued to quiver. Finally, my body slowed and her body relaxed letting me breathe in the pleasure and scent of her arousal.</p> <p>I held her for a while before I stood up and helped her get off the bed. I helped her dress as she walked me back to my car and then we had a long and very pleasant afternoon before we parted.</p> <p>The next day I was called into work for some meetings. One by one I could hear my husband and his girlfriend talking and giggling as I was walking away from the office. It was very quiet as we walked out the door and into the office. My husband was smiling and I held my hand out to him as a token of his support.</p> <p>On my way back to the office I leaned over his shoulder and kissed his cheek. "That was an incredible experience and I hope you enjoyed it."</p> <p>"It was wonderful and I look forward to seeing more of these things in the future! If you have any other requests, or more information for me to write, please let me know. Just don't wait until it is after midnight... or later.</p> <p>The Endâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
