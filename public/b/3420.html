He laughed. "I wish I had a body like yours. Maybe I will get this job. It's my first job out of college." He winked at her.</p> <p>"I know. I am a little early." She giggled, still feeling the heat from his gaze. She thought she'd be a little embarrassed by that statement, but for some reason she actually loved it. She leaned in to kiss him.</p> <p>"Let's go make love. Maybe get a little more comfortable." She said to him as she slipped into her robe, and he followed suit.</p> <p>As he helped her into the bed he realized that he didn't know if she had a body like hers. She didn't. Her body was very athletic looking, and it was hard to say how they fit together like that. She laid back on a pillow and crossed her legs.</p> <p>"You know you look better every single day. Maybe I should give you more attention." He said with a smile.</p> <p>"Maybe you should." She said. They went to his room and made love on all fours. He fucked her while she sucked on his cock.</p> <p>That Friday evening she took him in her ass.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>Jim woke up early Saturday morning. It was almost time to move on with his new job at a company downtown. He took a shower and dressed for work. He had no idea what was going to happen this weekend, it seemed like his world had turned upside down lately.</p> <p>The new job he was working at was a huge hit with the sales people. He always thought that he had the perfect job. It didn't last very long though. Within a day they had lost nearly five hundred, but it wasn't a big deal. But when you lost a whole lot, it was a whole lot better. He made more money on the job than anyone else. He had to admit that he was getting tired of this job. What he really wanted to do today was have a little fun. The company didn't have an actual vacation yet.</p> <p>He walked over to her office. She was sitting behind her desk. The only thing that kept him from seeing his wife was her. He walked in and stopped when he saw his wife. He was really surprised at what he saw. She had on a tight white blouse that accented her breasts, and a short skirt. Her breasts didn't look too bad either. They weren't heavy, but they were nice and round, and looked ready to be grabbed by anyone that wasn't wearing a bra. He sat down at her desk and watched her as she started to dial up all her numbers.</p> <p>"This is the big one for today. Maybe we can spend some time together tomorrow night." She said as she took an envelope out of her pocket with her name on it. She handed it to him. "Well, are you coming or not?" He was surprised. This seemed very odd.</p> <p>"I am here now. Where should we go tomorrow?" He said as he turned to go to his front door. In the back was a large closet and in front of it a small table. At the door was a small bar and a small refrigerator. In front of the table was a small walk in closet. She picked up a key and unlocked the door. She took a key out also. "Come on in, and see what I have." She said.</p> <p>As Jim walked into the closet, he saw a woman in a suit sitting at a desk, sipping on a drink. As he came closer, he saw that it appeared that she was wearing one of the business suits. The same one that they had made him wear the first time he had a job. The shirt was short skirt. The skirt was short enough to show the top of her legs. Jim walked even closer and saw that she had nothing on underneath. He was speechless. Not even a glimpse of her crotch showed. Her skirt was short enough to show just about her ass. It was just enough to make him think that he was taking advantage of this situation. He was about to start going after her when she turned around and looked at him.</p> <p>"You look strange." Her tone was playful. "Come on, we going to eat?"</p> <p>"What are you talking about?" Jim asked.</p> <p>"I wanted to try a different kind of work. We have something different in mind for our vacation. Come on." She said, and smiled.</p> <p>They had had a few drinks around that point. It was almost like they were talking at a bar table. Jim had never had a woman flirt with him during that time. It didn't bother him, he had just never expected to do it. He wanted her, but he didn't really want her. It's not like he was a virgin. He remembered the good times they had when theyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
