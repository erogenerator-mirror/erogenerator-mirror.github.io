I shouted just as he pulled out of my pussy as I could tell his balls were as empty as they always were. He was ready to blow as he pumped shot after shot of thick white cum onto my stomach and dripping down between my tits. I didn't mind a bit as the salty gobs hit my neck and down to the floor.</p> <p>When he was finished, I looked up at him with a smile as I started to roll over and kiss him. "That's the only thing I'm going to do," he said. He held my hands as I laid my body down and he pulled his shirt off over his head and we fell back on the bed. He was laying next to me as I rolled toward him, holding his head and kissing him.</p> <p>"I love this," he said. "I love you."</p> <p>"And I love you," I replied.</p> <p>He was quiet for a moment as he took another quick swallow of his beer. "I have never done it before," he said.</p> <p>"Not with you," I retorted. "Ever."</p> <p>He rolled over and cuddled up next to me. "I wouldn't mind if we did this right the first time," he said.</p> <p>I just nodded back as he ran his hands up and down my body.</p> <p>"Can I stay here with you?" he asked.</p> <p>"We'll have to have some privacy," I replied. "It'll be more intimate than just fucking in the same bed."</p> <p>"You sure?" he asked.</p> <p>"Definitely," I answered.</p> <p>We lay there for another minute before he asked me a question. "How does it work?"</p> <p>I thought I knew what he was thinking. "It's kind of complicated," I answered.</p> <p>"Is it something we do in our sleep?" he asked.</p> <p>I laughed a little. "Of course not. It's not like what we ever do when we're fucking like rabbits," I explained. "We do it on the couch in the living room. Just before we do it, we get really naked. If anyone else had walked in on us in the dark, I would've stopped immediately."</p> <p>He let out a little laugh. "I guess I'm kinda dumb. You can't tell me to stop."</p> <p>"Well, I can't tell you to stop," I answered back. "I've never felt so sexy. I can feel you getting bigger and harder. And I keep thinking about it now. How big it is. You know the difference between a cock that stretches me or you that goes in my ass, or I'm gonna be sore and I can't wait to shove my own cock up there and you'll fuck me in the ass."</p> <p>"You're going to have to show me," he said.</p> <p>"And you won't be getting that in my ass from now on?" I asked.</p> <p>"No, I think I'll just use my fingers for now. It'll just be my cock in your pussy," he answered. "I feel like we're about to sleep a little bit. If you're willing to let me fuck you in the ass, and I won't touch you. We have to think, but I don't want to rush anything," he explained.</p> <p>While we lay there, I was getting horny again, and I knew from experience that I would need to get something big as soon as possible. "I want to be fucked," I told him.</p> <p>"I want that too, Baby," he said.</p> <p>He pulled me into his arms and he kissed me for the first time in nearly two hours. I had an idea that if I gave him what he wanted before he came, I could give him what I wanted. "I can't wait until we get back home. I want you to eat me until you eat me again and then fuck me like I've never been fucked before," I told him.</p> <p>We laid there for a few minutes until he rolled off me. "What about in the bathroom?" he asked. "I gotta get my cock ready. I can't stand up if I go for a run."</p> <p>I smiled at him. "I can walk and take a shower in the other one. Just make sure the door's locked. This is not part of a two-minute fuckfest." We laughed as we were pulling on each others' clothes. We walked back into the bedroom and I had him lay face down on the bed as I started my shower. I was surprised at my strength. I didn't have a lot of control. We got into the shower and I had him move the shower head so it was facing him. While we were washing one of my breasts, I took one of his nipples between my fingers andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
