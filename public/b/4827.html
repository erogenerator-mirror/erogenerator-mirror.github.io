He had been in close proximity with another man since they had been introduced to each other, having even touched each other intimately. Now he couldn't think of anything other than those pictures.</p> <p>He thought about those pictures being of a man. It felt like his cock was being pulled up to her pussy, like they were kissing and fucking. Then he was picturing that first kiss, the second kiss, and then the three minutes or so of oral sex.</p> <p>When his attention went back to the picture, he couldn't help but imagine what it would be like to be with a woman. Would she be like this, with a man? What would the man think of them? Would she be so hot that he would fuck them? He imagined his cock sliding in and out of her pussy as he fucked her with all of his might.</p> <p>As his thoughts went back to the pictures, he started to feel a swelling in him, thinking about how hot it was to see his cock, his shaft, so hard and veiny, rubbing against her clit. It was like watching a porn star. It was like watching him, naked, having sex with a woman, seeing his cock as it slid in and out of his beautiful wife, seeing what it does to his body, what it makes him feel, what it makes his lover do. Yes, that's right; imagine a picture of a woman. Would she look the same? Would she enjoy this as much as he did?</p> <p>She seemed to enjoy the picture, as did he. It made him hope she would, too. Maybe, just maybe, she might have a chance with him someday.</p> <p>As he looked at the picture of his bride in all her naked glory, his cock was still in his jeans. Then he saw the picture of her in the shower. It made his cock swell in his pants. Not sure if it was because the picture he had of it was of his wife; maybe it was because he was trying to imagine she was with him. After all, as he remembered, he was trying to imagine his wife in more ways than one.</p> <p>He couldn't believe he was thinking about his wife. He couldn't believe he had been with a man again. He couldn't believe he had made love to his wife at last. She was just like his wife. And she was his.</p> <p>When his wife had kissed him, when she had tasted his pussy on his lips, he had always loved it. So he had loved that kiss. He loved how he had tasted, and he liked the way he had tasted while in his wife's mouth. The kiss she had given him had tasted of only the taste of her mouth. He now imagined kissing her there.</p> <p>He thought about how nice it was to kiss another man, kissing his wife. Just like he remembered that kiss last night.</p> <p>It wasn't just that he had been kissing her that way in the shower. He had been kissing her while he had her wrapped around his finger, and then that kiss had been more passionate, more passionate than either of the men he had known. He had been kissing her while his cock had been in her pussy. And the moment he had felt that cock of his inside her, as he had tasted her pussy, and as he had seen pictures of them while she had watched him fucking her, he had wished to give the picture to the man who had made him do it.</p> <p>He was jealous. He wanted to see him with another man... to see her with another man. He knew he would. He had been so happy when they had been together the first time. It had been great, the first time he met her. It had been great to meet her, to watch him as he walked through the gate to get to her, in that moment as she was kissing him, she had invited him into her room to kiss her, kiss her, so that he could enjoy her body as it had been enjoyed by him also. It had been so hot, he wanted to give her a second orgasm while he held her in his arms. It had been so fun to take her to her first orgasm.</p> <p>As if reading his mind, he realized that he had been thinking about how she had accepted having sex with a man, about the things they had felt, the things they could be doing now, while they were locked in a room, sharing a moment.</p> <p>He had wanted her. And was looking at her now. As if she were standing there, naked, watching him as he kissed her. He looked into his eyes and saw a hunger there. He wanted her more now than he had ever wanted anything. He wanted her to be all that he had ever wanted her to be.</p> <p>Was heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
