The rain came pouring down and it was a real shame that her friend Lisa, her best friend at college, would have left town earlier that day if she didn't have to work. All of them knew she wouldn't have seen Lisa that day if it had been just a dream. She had gone shopping with Mark last Friday, and he was there too, and she would hardly ever see him again.</p> <p>They had both been out at the mall with some of the other friends for the entire day as if they had nothing else to do that would get them out of the house. It was just her and her friend, all grown-up, and the one woman she had always known but had never spoken to. They had been friends for so long they didn't really seem to be able to talk about their own lives.</p> <p>Mark was at one of the coffee shops in town, looking forward to getting to see Rachel again, and she was there alone. All she could think about was what had happened that night. How her body would react to the images that had been dancing on her mind. That night she had let it all out, in the middle of the night just as she had let herself go. She loved that feeling. And now she felt guilt, shame, and lust for Lisa because of what she and her friends had gone through. And she had felt awful for the way her friends had talked about her at church.</p> <p>And she wasn't even trying to help get Lisa back. Not that Rachel had ever been able to. At least she hadn't acted like this. At least, she thought she still had control over her. Now she had to act as though everything had been ok. Not that anyone was even trying.</p> <p>And Rachel had been with Lisa a lot recently, but she wasn't sure she ever would be able to do that again. She did have one problem with doing that. She felt like she was being too forward, and it was embarrassing to her to do what she had done with Lisa and talk about it in front of everyone the way she had done. She needed to let go now. Rachel hated herself for how she had let it all hang out with Lisa. She hated that she would have to walk away from this if Lisa had been there, so she could get back to her old self. And that Lisa did, but she hated what she had done to her. She was so ashamed and so confused that she wanted to get back to her normal self in the end. She was afraid to let it grow again until the end.</p> <p>She felt as though this day was a big step on her journey, and she wondered if she had succeeded. She was feeling the same way now, she felt as if it was a good way to go. She had done what she had done to Lisa, and now she had to face that day. What was going to happen with her? And now she was faced with another possibility. She had to go home with her problems and think through them. Find her own path.</p> <p>As her phone rang, Rachel realized that a friend in town was calling telling her to hurry up. She smiled to herself at the feeling of excitement. She felt better already. Now that she did have to make a decision, she could finally let what had happened between Lisa and Mark take a stronger direction. She didn't feel like she had a choice, but she had to do this. She had to make good on her promise. She could only hope that it would be a good decision after all.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>The next morning, Rachel was in her kitchen preparing breakfast. She was doing a very serious job of preparing breakfast for Lisa, and for the evening. She really liked to cook, and she had been doing it many times. But she was beginning to get a little impatient about it. She had been trying to put some ideas into her head that Rachel might have to work with, but now she realized she was getting more work. She had already made coffee with the intention of making some toast. It was already past noon. Rachel had decided to make a simple breakfast. She wanted to make it easy and serve to remind Lisa. She decided to get the coffee on the counter, set it, and be quick. She made a cup of coffee.</p> <p>Her heart was pounding with excitement. She was so relieved, but at the same time she was nervous. The very thought of what had happened with Lisa that night had seemed so unimportant. It still didn't feel like the real life she had lived in as her own personal version of the events that had happened that night. But now it seemed that she had moved beyond that. It was a step back in the eyes of her own body. She knew that Lisa was looking at her, looking right through the window and for her to be feeling it too. They had been soâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
