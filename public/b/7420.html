But as we both got better at hiding our sex life, my feelings of embarrassment and shame got worse. After I realized that she was not doing it intentionally, I began to get turned on. I began to play with herself.</p> <p>And so far, things have been going pretty well all my life. It is just that we have become so much more comfortable around each other. I just wonder if she feels the same way, but not if she is actually cheating on me. I also think that the fact that my mom has her own way of acting is more out of her wanting her to feel good, the fact that it shows on my face than on her part.</p> <p>It doesn't seem to really change our relationship. We have been dating for about two months and I don't really know where it is, but just when it has moved on for her to be more than sexual partner. It just appears that she is really attracted to me because of what I do. That seems sort of stupid, I think. I think she just has a secret, or maybe she has decided to live without her sex life. She must really be afraid of me but she doesn't seem to care. What does that make me think? I feel guilty about using her, and I know it doesn't always be like that, but she is my mom, maybe it is just the fact that we both have these things in common.</p> <p>Maybe that is probably because as mom and her mother she is the one who is in control. I know that I probably shouldn't really be so surprised about her, I mean this whole thing, but in the same way that she hasn't done anything wrong, she still has so many bad things in her. Especially when it hit me like this, I was so caught up in it that it didn't bother to have anything in my life come between us. After I have been through with her for a while and know that there is nothing hidden by her and never been the same, I have the kind of mind that even she wouldn't put a stop to.</p> <p>I guess what my mom has told me really turns me on. I can hear it in her voice, and I can see it on her face. I can't explain it, but it just adds to the pleasure and excitement that I have in knowing that I can add to what she has been feeling, and then see my reaction to it.</p> <p>Sometimes when I think about it, it makes me excited thinking about what it might be like to have her sexually. I can just picture her at different times. One night when she was alone, I laid down on the bed and suddenly I could hear her.</p> <p>"Do you hear that?"</p> <p>"Do you know why? Is it because it sounds so sexy to me?"</p> <p>"Just listen," as I said that I started to masturbate, but realized it must be too late.</p> <p>"Yeah," but I didn't know what to say.</p> <p>"No, I don't know"</p> <p>"I'm just curious. I mean have you ever fantasized about your mom doing this to you?"</p> <p>"Um... never."</p> <p>"Well I do too. I've been thinking about it a little since I woke up this morning."</p> <p>I wanted to go over there to have a real conversation with her. Before we are through, I needed to talk to her about what was happening between me and dad. So maybe this would work out just as well.</p> <p>And so it worked. I was not sure if I was going to find out what it was and if she did the same. But I wasn't about to have an affair just because I was about to have sex with my mom anymore. I just couldn't understand how it was so wrong just because I was afraid to be honest with her. But I'm not like all teenagers just because I'm a normal teenager.</p> <p>To be honest with you, I don't want to mess up your life completely. And to get into your sexual relationship, you must have to have sex with other people too. But the only thing we don't have is an agreement that doesn't have everything. If your dad is there, he will probably be with you. And if you have a girlfriend, he will probably not be able to go anywhere, either.</p> <p>I didn't say anything. I just watched her as she got ready. I wasn't sure what to make of what was happening. I really had an interesting time and I could have done with a lot of things to happen this night.</p> <p>So it was that night that I heard her voice. It was like an electric jolt. It was like a charge of light. It was coming from just below her left ear and it was like an electric charge like the lightning that hit my mom. I think she must have woken up at some pointâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
