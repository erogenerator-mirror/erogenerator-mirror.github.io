Her face, body and soul felt like silk. I ran my hands all over her, feeling her full breasts, gently pinching her nipples. Her eyes were closed, waiting. She seemed so fragile that her entire situation was fragile. Her breath was hot against my cheek.</p> <p>"I'm taking off your pants," I said, standing up and unbuckling my own pants. "Let me take them off."</p> <p>Her face flicked towards the door, but she seemed to forget as she undid my belt and unzipped and dropped my pants, which fell to the floor. As she was kneeling in front of it, I was standing on her shoulders, naked of course, and my hand was in the waistband of her shorts. I held her gaze and she looked up at me for the first time.</p> <p>"Is this what you had in mind?" she asked.</p> <p>"Of course," I replied. "Do you want me in charge?"</p> <p>She was looking right at me. "Yes," she said softly.</p> <p>The way I held her in my arms didn't seem so bad after all. I kissed her cheek and then her lips. I leaned her over the arm of the couch and pushed her down to kneel in front of me. Her shorts fell to the floor, and the head of my dick just barely rested on her lips. She looked up at me and reached out and touched it.</p> <p>God, she was so sexy in that tight shorts. That tightness of that tightness caused my dick to twitch. I grabbed her by the hair and pushed her away, looking at her, the expression on her face telling me she was about to come. I kissed her lips and her neck, and then worked my way down, and then up, licking and nibbling on her breasts.</p> <p>"Oh, baby," she gasped, "that feels so good. What are you doing? I can't believe it..."</p> <p>"You like what I'm doing?"</p> <p>"Oh..."</p> <p>I kissed down her stomach, then pushed her thighs apart. Her shorts were already around her ankles, so she had no idea what to do. Her hands were on my face, pushing me into her. I kissed down the inside of each thigh, pausing for a moment, and then continued to kiss down the inside of each leg. I kissed her there again and she almost begged me to do it again. Finally, I knelt and slid her shorts off, then the rest of her. Her feet were hanging off the end of the couch as she stepped out of them. I went to my knees and spread her legs, and then lowered myself, forcing the skin of my tongue along her outer lips.</p> <p>There was a low, soft moan from her mouth, so I kept kissing her. The sound was as it had been before. Her breath was quick and shallow, and her hips moved beneath me. The moisture began to seep through her lips into my mouth. I kept kissing and licking and sucking from her pussy, and she began to make short little gasps and hissings.</p> <p>"Oh myyyy...Ohmyyyy..." she whimpered, "oh...oh myyyyyy..."</p> <p>I continued to kiss and lick all around her pussy, taking the time to gently tease her. I moved my tongue up to her clit, and then back down again. Her entire body tightened, and before long she was whimpering and thrashing. "Jesus, I'm going to come...I'm going to...ohh...oh...oh...oh..." she gasped.</p> <p>I pulled back to look at her, and saw the flush spreading across her cheeks, the lips of her pussy. The eyes, still closed, had turned wide, but she was smiling. Her lips were still pressed tightly together, but her hand was slowly sliding along the inside of her thigh, up to her hip.</p> <p>"I can't believe you're doing this," she breathed. "You know I've wanted you."</p> <p>"I know. We've both fantasized," I answered, stroking around her clit with my tongue.</p> <p>"I want your cock," she said, slowly pushing my head away. "I want it so bad."</p> <p>"You're not ready to get it yet."</p> <p>"I'm so wet." I slid two fingers inside her, slowly at first, and then a little faster. "I want you to fuck me," she said breathlessly. "I want you to make me comeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
