He whispered as he walked up to the door.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Thank you so much for all my feedback. I also would like to thank everyone that voted and left comments. The feedback is great and the votes are always appreciated. I will continue to write the next chapter of this story.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Sitting in the bar, I drank my beer while reading the stories that I had finished reading.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Lying on my back, as the music started, I closed my eyes listening to the music while my hand rubbed myself on my chest, the song only increasing as time passed.</p> <p>I couldn't believe the events of the evening that had happened. I had a beautiful beautiful lovely angel girl that I loved to be with and had sex with. I was just over done in the bar, and was just waiting to see her again.</p> <p>As the song ended, I opened one eye and saw the smile on her lips, and I smiled back. I closed my eyes, and a smile quickly faded as I heard the door open, and the music start, and she stood there. She was wearing a silky pink dress, and it accentuated her full curves perfectly, as I couldn't help but stare at her as she came across the room, holding a drink in her hand.</p> <p>"Hi there, come, have a drink," she said as I reached for my beer, her eyes never leaving my face.</p> <p>I was frozen in place, unable to move except for my body, waiting for her to take my hand and lead me to her table, and I couldn't tear my eyes away as we went.</p> <p>The night was beautiful and the drinks were flowing, as she got up a little earlier than her normal time of 4:00pm. I sat back and we talked and drank a little longer before getting up.</p> <p>When she sat down, I turned around and we looked into each other's eyes. "I've got a surprise for you tonight," she said as she winked.</p> <p>"Oh no, you don't, just don't!" I smiled and took a sip of my drink and we sat there for a little longer.</p> <p>"We should go to your hotel, I haven't even kissed you yet," she smiled.</p> <p>"We should," I said, and my smile returned.</p> <p>"Good, that'd be nice." She grabbed my hand and we continued to walk to the hotel. All the thoughts about what I had seen had me so turned on, that I didn't even get to finish my beer.</p> <p>She laughed and said she had a surprise for me in a hotel room, because she had bought some new lingerie. She had even put on a skirt and blouse, for the night and had even taken her bra off, so that it was clear to me that she had a nice pair of 34DD tits that you just couldn't resist.</p> <p>That night I had to be honest with myself, that just looking at her got me so worked up. I was still drunk, but my body was reacting to her. Her breasts were so firm and filled out, and my hands had been rubbing them through my clothes and my cock was hard. It was all in front of the mirror, and I was staring at her.</p> <p>We sat there in each others arms, and I felt myself getting more and more drunk. Finally she had to go to the men's room and I started to open the small bag that held the toy. While I was looking at the toy, I tried to pull it out but couldn't. She laughed and said that she was sorry, she wanted so bad to see my cock.</p> <p>"Is that really true, you are hard already?" I asked with a smile.</p> <p>"It is, really," she said, and pulled a tube off the top, and started to rub the small round plastic thing on her clit, and slowly worked it. I had no idea she had this in her hand or that it would be so big.</p> <p>"I know you have one." I shook my head no, but I knew it was true. I was just beginning to feel the effects. I tried to look away but couldn't, and then she leaned in as she began to pinch her nipples. I couldn't help myself from staring at her chest while I stared at her nipples.</p> <p>I had to touch myself, but then I saw her eyes close and she took a step backwards a little. She took a drink of her beer and smiled, before she walked on over to me.</p> <p>"Here's your surprise, silly," she laughed, and pulled me forward by my cock. I felt myself being pulled from my senses, and was beginning to notice myself in a new way.</p> <p>"My surprise," I said, and leaned back against her, feeling my dick getting harderâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
