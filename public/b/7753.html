"I'm sure you'll find out," she said, and then she reached up and pushed the bra back out of the way, slipping the cups down over her perky breasts. The look on my face was priceless when, after she'd taken off my shirt and undid my buttons, she leaned in and began sucking and nibbling on the nipples on my chest. The feel of her tongue and teeth as she bit down on the first one sent my cock back to full mast. Alicia's little hand stroked it, and the whole experience just made both my cock and my mind go insane with sensation, and as she took in a breath, I watched as my cock got even harder, and the tip was already peeking out the top. I couldn't help myself any longer. I took the tip in my mouth, and was unable to stop myself from giving into the overwhelming lust my heart was experiencing. When I wrapped my lips around the head, Alicia jerked her mouth away quickly and looked up at me, surprise still on her face. "What?" she asked, and then I was already sliding down so I could kiss and lick her, my tongue sliding over hers.</p> <p>Alicia moaned with appreciation as our tongues danced. After I sucked on the tip, she pulled up on my shoulders and leaned back against the shower wall that was standing in front of the showerhead. I looked up at her as she lifted her leg off the ground and spread it to give me another one of her beautiful crescences. Her skin was perfect and smooth, and as I looked over into her eyes, I saw something so beautiful and sexy. I leaned in and gently kissed over her neck, and Alicia's back arched in a response. "Hurry, Baby," she groaned, pressing her body closer to mine. I could feel her hands running through my hair and down my face, so I decided to up the pace and began working my way down her chest. I kissed down onto her shoulder, then up to her breast and took the nipple in my mouth, sucking it gently between my lips, licking at it as my fingers toyed with her other nipple. Alicia reached up and grabbed my hair, pulling my lips to hers harder. When I bit down on her nipple and Alicia cried out, her hands tightened in my hair, and began bucking her body against my own. Alicia's hips were driving me into place, rubbing her cockette in my lap with each bounce, and I could feel both of us getting ready to cum. It was a little scary, but I knew I could handle it and Alicia wouldn't be mad. She didn't seem to either.</p> <p>When Alicia screamed and began screaming, and the whole thing just seemed to go on and on, I could feel the cum boiling in my nuts, and with each orgasm, I could feel them tighten up. It felt amazing, and I couldn't wait to hold Alicia on top of me again. It wasn't anything I had ever done to her before, but it was still somehow a little weird at the time. She gave me the most loving smile, and I looked up at her to find my hand stroking off my own cock. I took my free hand and moved it up so I had a little handhold. Alicia had her eyes closed, and her lips were a little parted. I put both of my hands on her hip and slowly started pulling her forward a little. I could feel her trembling on top of my hands. My hands were tingling with excitement and it made my whole body quiver. I felt as Alicia continued to quake. As her mouth opened and caught my breath again, I looked down at her face. She seemed so happy. Her eyes were glazed over, and she was breathing heavily. I could feel the warmth of passion and I reached over and began kissing down her throat. That's when she opened her eyes, and I stared straight into her face as I began sucking her nipple again. I could hear her breathing get shallow as I continued, and I began to feel her muscles tremble. If anything, she was even tighter against my hand.</p> <p>I could hear her moaning and sighing even more. I let my hand drop, and Alicia grabbed the back of mine, pushing back against me. Her body began twitching uncontrollably, and her hands tightened up on my head just a hair's width. I let my hand slide up and down her body again, and she pulled her mouth back from mine, her eyes still closed. "Do you know what you felt that first?" she asked.</p> <p>I just smiled and shook my head slowly. I watched Alicia's face for a few moments, noticing that she was biting her lip lightly, so I reached over and put my hand on the one she hadn't been biting.</p> <p>"You're getting really sensitive, aren't you?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm getting veryâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
