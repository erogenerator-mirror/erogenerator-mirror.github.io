Just the thought of another day out at the sea seemed to fill me with a heavy tension that only I could fill, and that it would only be in my deepest sleep.</p> <p>It took yet another five minutes before there was even a sign on the roof where the sun appeared to be setting, and in that time I was alone in the kitchen, eating an orange juice, reading for about ten more minutes, and just watching the girls dancing, and drinking their wine, with both of them having their eyes closed, enjoying the music...</p> <p>"What did you think?" Katie turned her head and asked, looking over at me. "I sure looked good dancing with my boyfriend today!" I could almost see her look across at me, and as I looked over, I could clearly see her chest heaving in her tight T-shirt, and the fabric was clinging to her nipples, which were clearly showing with the thin fabric. I looked up at her, and could see her eyes watching my expression, watching my cock begin to harden in my pants. I blushed and just smiled at her.</p> <p>"He's gorgeous," she finally announced, and a wave of relief came over me like a wave. "I didn't think I would ever get to know him very well."</p> <p>I watched her as she finished off her juice, and got up to go to the bathroom. As she closed the bathroom door, I looked to her watch and noticed my cock now, hard as steel and pushing against my zipper, pushing forward towards my stomach. I just sat there, wondering what had actually happened.</p> <p>As she came out of the bathroom, I was so overcome by her beauty that I was a statue. Her body was lithe and slim with long blond hair, curling into a tousled frame that flowed down over her shoulders and around her large, luscious breasts, so that only she could see them from just under the thin, lacy top of it, and they moved with it in an almost rhythmic, hypnotic motion. The thin, lacy fabric barely covered them, and made her cleavage look like it was two halves and her nipples only slightly larger than the top. Her legs were long and muscular, and her thighs were wide, with perfectly formed calves, and long legs just accentuated her long, lean form.</p> <p>Her legs were completely bare, so that I could see her neatly-trimmed bush on her mound, which she was slowly, deliberately sliding closer to the edge of the tub. She had one of the best asses I had ever seen, and despite my embarrassment when I first saw her at the airport that summer, by now I could easily see that she possessed one of the most perfectly formed, pert asses on the planet.</p> <p>Her waist was even wider, and while she turned sideways to go back into the kitchen to get a fresh glass, I had to look close to see what she was wearing.</p> <p>I'm not one to judge, because I have never thought much about what a girl looks like naked, and her body was one of the first things that caught my eye. I also have never been into women myself, because I don't know what to do with a girl if I even touch her. I'm not at all attracted to girls because I think most guys won't even notice their body the way I look at them if they don't know that it's just for show. It just seems so much less attractive to me to see a girl like Katie, though, so, I just let it slip a little when I looked around the room at the little piles of books on the shelves.</p> <p>As soon as I had the chance to study Katie to myself, I realized there was something that intrigued me, and in the time it took me to study her and wonder, I realized that if she saw my interest in her, I could just chalk her up a bad night if she asked me too. It was only a couple of hours later that I came back to the present and saw that she had closed up all of her glasses.</p> <p>I had to say she looked sexy. I had always been drawn to women with big, luscious, long hair, and it was something that I had always thought Katie would do in front of her boyfriend. To see her do it, to imagine she was standing behind him, rubbing herself against him, as he bent over, to do a pirouette in front of me, would be sheer torture.</p> <p>And so, I didn't even give her a chance to close anythingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
