I have been thinking up a plan and this just so happened." With that, I kissed him deeply. His tongue explored hers as he took the strap from around her neck. It slipped to a stop behind his head. Her body was exposed to the light from the corner of the hotel room. His hands moved to cup her breasts. He could already feel the hardness of her nipples against his palms. His fingers ran over the tip and the softness of her skin. She shuddered and he slid a hand between her legs. They were wet and he could feel her wetness at the same time. He continued to caress her breasts. My tongue played lightly with her nipple as she wrapped her legs to give him room. He loved how her body responded to his touch. I knew that when you are ready to give yourself completely to another, you will know it.</p> <p>"I love you. Please," she whispered to him. He loved to be in control as he kissed and sucked on her. It made me wild for him. Her body was still, but moving. My body tingled as I knew that there was still one thing I would not give to her. "You may caress me. But not inside me. Ohhh." He could only groan as she moved her fingers to his hair. His hand found her vagina and began to stroke her. I heard her moan as his hand slid inside. She was so wet. He slid one finger into her as his thumb stroked her clitoris. Her body tensed as her orgasm began. He began to kiss her gently as a reminder of his own. He began to rub his cock against her thigh and she was surprised at how big it looked. But then, she felt his hand slip from her with a groan. "Turn around for me."</p> <p>He turned as she moved slowly toward him. As he stepped back from her, I began to undo his belt. He stood there, completely naked except for one thing. But then, I couldn't do anything more. "Would you please let me touch?"</p> <p>She took his cock in hand and began to stroke him while watching us. Then, she slid the head into her throat.</p> <p>"Oh!"</p> <p>I was standing right in front of her as she sucked him. She leaned forward so that her nose just barely touched the head. Her lips formed a perfect O and I could see his balls sway as she drew his dick deeper into her throat. She could hardly take in his head as it touched her throat.</p> <p>"No," he gasped as her lips took his whole cock. I could see his dick slide into her mouth with the pressure of her throat as she began to draw him in further. She pulled her mouth back just enough for his head to pop out of her mouth and then went back down, repeating the pattern. Her tongue swirled and tickled the skin as she sucked just over the head. Her hands were stroking his cock as she did this. His body shook. I knew he was about to cum. And I wanted to watch as he f—</p> <p>Then, she stopped as if in a daze. She stood up, turned to me as she did and said, "Didn't you finish? Would you please put it in me now?"</p> <p>I said, "Of course. I still haven't quite finished."</p> <p>"I will finish for you." And she smiled that sexy smile of hers. She lifted a finger to me and said that she always wanted to do this. I kissed her finger and then guided her mouth to hers. I could feel the wetness of her mouth as her tongue pushed into mine. I held her breasts so that she could hold them. Our mouths opened and our tongues touched. She was wet and hot and I could hear her breathing change as they touched. I put her lips to mine and pressed them as tight together as I could. I could feel her hands running through my short hair as we kissed. Her mouth was aching to give me more of her, but I wanted her to feel what my body felt so she gently guided mine to hers. As they touched, she gently began to stroke my nipples. I could feel her finger tracing my labia. It felt as if I had already been there.</p> <p>Her finger began to probe me as our kiss turned to one of a kind. She rubbed her wet finger gently over my clitoris as much as rubbing me. As my hand found her breast, my finger found her nipple with the same gentle touch. We came together a few moments later as she ran her finger over my slit. We had barely stopped kissing when the hotel room door opened. I had forgotten about it; the sight of her naked as she stroked her own body had sent a thrill right to my own groin.</p> <p>"I need to clean up now, and—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
