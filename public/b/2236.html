"I think you are going to cum, aren't you?</p> <p>I just nodded and held her tighter, her body wracked by a series of long, hard orgasms that sent her crazy. She just collapsed onto the hood of the car, totally spent. In the process, she brought her leg up and locked my cock into a hard grip and began sliding it in and out of her pussy just a few inches.</p> <p>We stayed like that for a few minutes.</p> <p>I could see she was exhausted. She kissed me and then began kissing me very deeply again. All thoughts of our future were lost. Finally, she pulled away and looked at my face.</p> <p>"Thank you, I've never had one that good at intercourse before. Did you cum, too? Was it good for you, too?"</p> <p>That answer took my breath away.</p> <p>We lay there for some time, and she caressed my cock and balls. I could feel it starting to deflate. Finally, she sat up and kissed me. Then she ran her fingers over my face.</p> <p>"That was very special," she said. "It's been a long time. I don't want it to stop."</p> <p>She looked at my face and I think she could see my disappointment. I had been expecting a kiss but was not prepared for her touch. She looked at me seriously and asked, "Are we going to do this again?"</p> <p>"Yes," I said. "There's no need."</p> <p>"Why?" she asked. "I was hoping you'd not think anything of it."</p> <p>"I wish we had done it a couple times."</p> <p>She laughed. "Honey, we're just doing this now. It's what I've wanted for years as I wanted the best of both the world and myself. I hope you didn't mind, though. We may not be the couple we're not; maybe we'll be the couple again. Just don't think me a lesbian. If you're still curious about why, tell me."</p> <p>"Of course I want to know," I said. "I wouldn't say that you are not attractive, but I'm sure you're not really my type."</p> <p>She smiled. "No, of course not. I'm flattered, but I certainly will never tell you that."</p> <p>I reached across the way and grabbed her.</p> <p>"You are so young," I said. "I think I'd like to see what other people are like."</p> <p>She gave a weak smile and nodded.</p> <p>"I think we will have fun again," she said emphatically. "Now that we have that out of the way, I'm going to return the favor. I want to make love to you again. This is the first time I'm doing this, you know, so I want you to feel totally comfortable."</p> <p>She got onto her hands and knees and looked back at me. Her ass was in the air and I could tell by the look and feel of it that she was getting ready to fuck. I took off my pants and stood behind her. I slid my cock into her, feeling the wetness of her vagina.</p> <p>At first it wasn't all that hard to do. I slid all the way in, feeling her muscles tighten against me. She was still having some problem getting used to me, as I slid in and felt that tight pussy squeeze me. I began to rock in and out of the beauty of her. First slow and almost gentle. The first couple of strokes were just enough. I leaned over, kissed her back as my hands slid across her body. I caressed her back and then her lower back as I began to fuck her. As quickly as I started, I stopped and looked down at her beautiful, naked body with her breasts jiggling and swaying. Her eyes closed as she leaned forward. I could see the pleasure in her eyes as she looked back at me.</p> <p>I looked around the outside of the car for something to hold onto, something to grab, anything to hold onto as I fucked her. Nothing had worked yet, but I was determined to try. After a few minutes of gentle lovemaking, I found a piece of rubber from the hood to hold myself against. I got on my knees behind her and pulled her back onto my cock. She wrapped her legs around me and pushed back. It looked like our little group was fucking again.</p> <p>My hands came up over her shoulders to push myself fully into her pussy. And I was still holding onto some of the rubber to keep from falling. I reached up and pulled the rubber hood up away from her head and held it between us as I fucked her. She looked back over her shoulder. Her legs were still locked behind mine, but she was leaning forward so that I was almost pulling her up andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
