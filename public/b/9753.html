You're going to fuck me!" she said sternly, her eyes now sparkling with excitement. She leaned her head back on the bed and said, "I want you to fuck my mouth." Her tone was almost a plea for me to do it. I was going to.</p> <p>She sat up and reached over to the nightstand where the tube of Astroglide was waiting. She spread the lube generously over her nipples and her stomach. Then she put her fingers in the jar of Vaseline and rubbed it in. Her eyes opened wide as she felt a jolt of electricity run through me. She smiled like I was some kind of a kitty cat and licked her lips, spreading the slippery clear goo onto her lips and then down one side of her breasts. All the while, she fingered herself.</p> <p>"I told you to do as I ask," she said. "If you don't like what you are about to do... do so now!" she said, looking straight into my eyes.</p> <p>I stared back at her with a stunned expression on my face. What she just did was... and... and I loved it.</p> <p>"Now?" I exclaimed, my heart racing.</p> <p>"Yes," she said. "Now!" and she moved toward me. She got up on her hands and knees and crawled toward me. She placed one hand on my erection and guided with it. "Mmmm... I'm glad you like it," she cooed as she leaned over me toward the headboard of my bed. She pulled the headboard against the wall with her and then sat down, looking back at me with glazed eyes. "I can't wait anymore," she said, and then slowly turned her head toward me until we were eye-to- eye. "Now," she said, "you can fuck my mouth!"</p> <p>I was amazed as she took my cock and slowly guided me toward her mouth. There wasn't another square inch of my shaft exposed to her, and even as thick as it was, she could barely take it all inside her mouth. Still holding my hips, I felt as if a steel pole was slowly rising and falling inside her.</p> <p>I looked into those hypnotized eyes for what seemed like a full minute, but was maybe only five seconds. That was so incredibly exciting to me. Then, she suddenly stopped, looking up and into my eyes. "I want to taste you," she said. She reached up behind her head and placed several pillows against the headboard where she had been sitting. She leaned forward, resting her hands against the pillows. Looking back at me, she smiled and then took my wet cock into her mouth.</p> <p>I watched in amazement as she went at it. I had just cum almost immediately after feeling her mouth on my erection, in the middle of the night. Her head moved up and down as she worked her hand up and down. I couldn't decide if she was teasing me, or whether she was simply enjoying it. Either way, I closed my eyes and was lost in the moment, feeling my orgasm building within my loins. I never noticed that my hand had stopped moving in time with her movements. Instead, it was like nothing I'd ever done.</p> <p>"Mmmm..." My wife moaned, her lips tight on me. I knew I was about to explode. I let the breath escape as another orgasm racked my body. She seemed to sense that my breathing had become ragged as she slowly let my cock slip from her mouth. "Oh, my," she said, smiling. "That was wonderful!" I felt my chest go suddenly hot and heavy. "I'll make you cum again!" I thought.</p> <p>She didn't say anything, she just looked at me and kept stroking me. "Come. Come inside," she said. With those words, I gave in and let the waves of intense pleasure sweep over me as my orgasm swept through me. As much as I was enjoying being inside her, I still felt the thrill of being inside her while I came. I felt it coming. I felt it coming from me.</p> <p>I felt it coming. "Oh, my," I thought as I let loose and I felt myself go limp and fall away from her. My breath had just gone back to normal as her mouth opened and she looked up at me.</p> <p>"No more? Do you want me to stop?" she asked. I thought about it for a moment and then smiled. "No... you have to do that again... and you have to do it while you are still hard," I said. It seemed like such a natural thing to do to say that.</p> <p>"I promise," she said, her head still turning toward me. "I need to get him ready to fuck me again this evening.
