I moaned like a little girl, arching my back and pushing my ass out to his face.</p> <p>We laid there for a little bit. I could feel my husband's tongue on my breasts, and the feel of his fingers in my pussy, but mostly just the feeling of the soft lips of his mouth sucking at my pussy.</p> <p>We spent the rest of the evening trying to find a time to take our pleasure without leaving our spouses in the room.</p> <p>The next morning, the phone rang again, this time with a very sexy voice, my husband. It was my lover, asking if I'd like to come over for a visit. Well, I guess a man and woman on the phone would have some sort of a sexual connection.</p> <p>So this time, I answered the phone.</p> <p>She told me she wasn't going to be disappointed once I left for work. "This one is for you. The other is for you," she smiled. "My cunt is just beside you. You were amazing last night."</p> <p>What could I do? I couldn't go on!</p> <p>A minute later, I felt my husband come onto the phone, and then again. My body tingled with anticipation and I could barely contain myself. My husband was sucking my nipples, and it turned me on to do it. He put his hand behind me, and in one motion, he spread my ass-cheeks. He was now pushing his cock against my pussy for me to take in.</p> <p>He started with his tongue, and it was a little surprised I was letting him in. "Just relax," he would say, and I'd do the same.</p> <p>I felt him get very close to me, when he did. He pushed a little, and I felt the first wave of warm semen hit my ass hole. The next two spurts felt like they were going to go right on my skin. He made one last shot, and then his lips met mine. I could feel the cum on my tongue, and even through his lips. His kiss felt so nice.</p> <p>"Mmmmm," I said, breathlessly.</p> <p>I had almost forgotten about the phone then.</p> <p>"So did you enjoy what you heard?" my husband asked.</p> <p>"Oh yes, thank you for asking," I responded. "It was wonderful!"</p> <p>"Honey," his voice was kind, "we can't do anything without making a mess. The first time, I hope you know that, but this time, I want to enjoy everything.</p> <p>"Don't worry—the next time, I'll tell you about it."</p> <p>I heard the shower turning on as I had to get him up out of bed before he started getting dressed. I slipped into the bedroom and laid on top of him, kissing him all over. Finally, after letting him kiss me deeply, I rolled off him, and lay beside him. We had wonderful sex—I can't even describe what it was.</p> <p>We had a wonderful time with the phone sex again in the morning. I knew that he had to use the "no sex" clause, and I said that I wouldn't make him stop. He replied that that wasn't necessary. Then I asked him if this might be a good time to bring up our phone sexual escapades.</p> <p>"I'm just glad it'll be something we can't see from back there."</p> <p>"So am I!"</p> <p>That night, my husband and I went out shopping for some new lingerie. It was a really sexy black number I'd bought. My husband had said I looked great in it.</p> <p>I was in the bed, again, naked, waiting for him to come to me. He came and got me, and his hand caressed every inch of my body, even in the wetness of my sex.</p> <p>"Honey, do you mind if I get you some lubrication?" he asked.</p> <p>"Of course not, dear. We've got to take this slow."</p> <p>His hand started to work its way down my body, touching my clit. When he had finished, he took hold of me, and pushed me onto my back. His hands ran up and down over my body, occasionally coming back up to caress my breasts.</p> <p>My husband was now between my legs, again, and was using the hand lube, and fingers to tease me. It felt wonderful, and he knew my body so well. Soon, he was sliding his fingers in and out of me—making me moan and whimper. "What do you think?" he asked.</p> <p>"God, yes, honey, we're going to go slow, so don't—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
