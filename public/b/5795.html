It seemed almost like a new life. We were living together, or at least that was the way it sounded, and it wasn't an unhappy life or anything. The new life was a big change. I didn't want to take the chance of being rejected. I thought maybe I would. I was just being stupid. My dad said he would always be there to help me become a woman, so it was no big deal.</p> <p>I didn't know what to expect out of this. He was going to be back in town for six weeks, and I had only taken a chance on getting with another guy. That was just the beginning. We would be getting tested for diseases. There were lots of STD's and pregnancy tests in this place, but there were also lots of pregnancy tests. I was having doubts, a lot of doubts. This might not just be a simple thing. The idea of becoming a woman, getting pregnant, had me on edge. I was afraid of what might happen on our relationship if I was to say that it wouldn't be okay to have intercourse in the future. How would we handle it? Would we actually be able to make love at all if I didn't want to. What if I wanted to? What if I didn't? What if, after six weeks without that thing? I was pretty sure this would be the best of all to have a baby. The fact that I was still looking forward to taking the risk of being with this other man didn't help.</p> <p>What would it be like? Was I going to be able to get along with my new partner? Would it be different between men if I was just fucking him and going home? Would that cause me some kind of awkward or awkward position? That was the question in my head. I felt like saying no. It would be like taking the pill for him. That was the most reasonable scenario right now. I didn't have the courage to take the chance. I wasn't sure I was in the right mode. I didn't think I could do this one and do it all again. I didn't think that would be fair.</p> <p>Of course not, I didn't think I could do the whole thing together. I just wasn't in the mood for him to fuck me. I felt his penis growing in my crotch. I pushed my hips into his as he humped me and I could feel the tip of him growing further with each thrust. I wanted to take it out if I wanted to. I wanted to feel it sliding against my cervix and into me. That kind of made me excited and excited me, but I didn't want to be with him if I didn't want to. I wanted to feel him filling me up.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" I heard him ask. It was a question. I felt it in my brain. I'd been getting it. What he could use was something a bit less obvious. "I'll go slowly," I said. "I want to make this last." I felt him take the plunge and push away. I felt him move around. I felt something that felt a bit like a wet toothbrush being pressed against my clit. I felt his fingers in me, he pushed me back. There was the nudge in my pussy. He pushed it in and it felt pretty weird. I felt it slipping. I felt the pressure on me. I felt the pressure building. I got wet. Was this going to be just another experience? I didn't want to go through that again and it took all I had to stay with him, so I just started to move my hips. I wanted to get some kind of relief.</p> <p>I started the motion I always wanted to have. He pushed the finger up me, I felt it and he followed. I felt my insides contracting, pulsing, and contracting around the penis inside me. I came, and it was more than I was expecting. I felt the orgasm come, as it did every time I came. I felt it coming hard and fast. When it was done, it was the most intense orgasm of my life. I collapsed on the couch on my stomach next to Mark. He was still inside me. I was still breathing heavily. I tried to go still. I was so tired that I didn't even feel his dick twitch.</p> <p>Mark wasn't there as the time ended. We dressed and he walked me to the door and then he kissed me on the cheek, and the door closed. He didn't say anything. Then he left. I just sat there. I sat and wondered what to say or do. I didn't want to say anything. I just wanted to get it over with. He got up and was gone. I could have been disappointed if I didn't want to say anything at all to him about what had happened.</p> <p>I don't remember what happened next.
