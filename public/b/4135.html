"Not so fast. I'm too late. They're already downstairs."</p> <p>"I was told they were just upstairs." He smiled, but wasn't happy. His eyes were on the door to the bedroom. There was no room.</p> <p>"You're not going to take a chance?" She said, "We need to talk."</p> <p>"I promise. I can tell that."</p> <p>"Just let us talk."</p> <p>"No, no." He said, "You don't."</p> <p>"I know, but I can't think what else."</p> <p>"I'm sure you can."</p> <p>"But we still gotta talk, right?"</p> <p>"The sooner the better..."</p> <p>"OK!" She kissed his cheek softly. "Bye."</p> <p>"Bye."</p> <p>"Bye. And..." She said quietly as she leaned in and kissed him lightly on his lips. "Bye."</p> <p>He turned on his heel and walked down the hall, trying not to let the heat of her skin make him burn.</p> <p>***</p> <p>"Well..." John thought. "He's got a great set of tits."</p> <p>There was another note to her from one of their client, with a phone number and place. She wrote off to a 'nest' and left with it, saying there wouldn't be any problems. With that he got to the kitchen.</p> <p>She wasn't home when he walked through the door. The lights were off, the door was shut, the TV was turned on, and their food was on the table.</p> <p>He sat down, but didn't make anything. He could hear the rustling of a pair of shorts.</p> <p>She was on her knees, kneeling on the carpeted floor in front of John's chair.</p> <p>"I've been thinking more about that than all this work, and I'm hungry."</p> <p>"Yeah, but you're not hungry, just doing what's right." He said. "You're my best customer."</p> <p>"I'm not, I'm not..." John was starting to feel a bit guilty for taking advantage of her, despite all the work they and her friends were doing. "...just doing what's right."</p> <p>At that she didn't look away from him. The movement caught his eye. She had a hand on his thigh, moving it slowly, up, lower, and over his shorts. She was using the other hand to massage his penis through the fabric of his shorts. And it was pretty nice.</p> <p>"So, um..." He said. "I understand why you're working out. But why don't you come home for dinner?"</p> <p>"I was just thinking."</p> <p>"OK. Maybe we should keep it informal."</p> <p>"I think so."</p> <p>He wasn't sure what she meant, as she was leaning up against him. She hadn't said another word but instead put her lips right next to his ear. She ran her tongue softly along his neck and into his ear.</p> <p>"I don't think I am going to argue with you." She whispered and he felt something soft, not quite warm, sliding up his body, across his stomach and up to the tip of one of his toes, right below his navel.</p> <p>He felt the warmth of her breast against him.</p> <p>"That feels nice." He whispered.</p> <p>A second nipple touched his lips. He tasted it, tasting her.</p> <p>He looked at her, then slowly down to his own chest.</p> <p>There was just a bit of moisture on the area around her nipple, but the nipples were hard and erect.</p> <p>"That feels nice." John whispered and they both smiled.</p> <p>She pulled the tip of his nipple in her mouth gently and John shuddered. "Does it?... Do you like this." She smiled and took the nipple and sucked on it.</p> <p>He could feel the warmth of the touch of her hand on his thigh. She was not wearing panties.</p> <p>"You know you want to." She said, then took his hand and placed it on her thigh. "We can't have that anymore."</p> <p>John's hand moved up to her crotch.</p> <p>She leaned against him, leaning her other breast in his lap.</p> <p>"I need to, ah, I need to..."</p> <p>"Right here?" John asked.</p> <p>"Yeah." She whispered as her other hand caressed his cheek.</p> <p>John began to rub her bare thigh and he could feel a slight dampness where he'd been kissing it. She was hot and hot. He was really getting into it too.</p> <p>One ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
