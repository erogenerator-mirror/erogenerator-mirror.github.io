It may seem like you don't have much to worry about, but I have a great body, your wife isn't even the most amazing woman that I have ever met, and your dad is such a lucky man." He continued.</p> <p>"Thank you, I think you are just right, you are perfect that way," she said with a cheeky smile. She started to undo his zipper and pulled out his cock. It was now semi-erect but bigger than ever before, she stroked it with her hand while she played with his balls with the other. It was an amazing experience.</p> <p>She bent forward and took his dick in her mouth. It wasn't the longest or thickest dick I had ever had, but it seemed to grow with each passing moment, and as my wife sucked him, her body glistened with perspiration. I could see he was getting close too, she continued to pleasure him and with each downward motion, his chest would jerk against her erect nipples. She must have felt it as well, because she was groaning in satisfaction and I could see his fingers move over her nipples and he gently squeezed them. Within minutes he was moaning, "God that feels good." She was having the same reaction, she increased her sucking and stroking just a little so he could feel her tongue stroking his whole length. I watched, for a minute, as my wife worked her magic on his dick and balls, she was lost in her own pleasures. She had never let me lick her pussy before, I had no idea if she was enjoying herself then, but as she did it, it made me feel so powerful. I realized that I could go to another state for a while before I could even think about going there. I looked at the clock. I was going to have the whole trip in two hours, the sun was about to come out.</p> <p>"How much longer should I be gone?" I asked.</p> <p>"You might think you'll get away, but we'll make a good time." She responded. He smiled and went to take a shower. With my wife still on her knees, he entered her twice before she came up to see him. His dick was getting bigger with every stroke, and each time it was touching her face, and his balls slapped against her forehead a little. My wife kept on sucking him long after he was done, sometimes pausing for breath as if her tongue wasn't on him. Occasionally he would cum in her mouth, so as to make it easier to feel his cum in her throat, it didn't seem right to lick his balls and cock at the same time. It was one of the things I liked about my wife in this position, even though she had just taken his dick down her throat she still had more control over his dick. When she stopped, I was sure she was going to do it again, but once again, I had to have that amazing piece of ass. I could get used to this way!</p> <p>On the ride back to the office, I thought of how much I liked it when he could make that thing go in and out of my mouth, and how much I was enjoying myself, the way she could suck him off.</p> <p>It was all new for me, but I guess that the changes that had been made in the last half-hour had made me rethink all my previous desires about eating his cum out of my wife's mouth, but that I'd be happier when I got awayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
