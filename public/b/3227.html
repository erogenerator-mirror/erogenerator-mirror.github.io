I've been a real disappointment.'</p> <p>'Oh I know.'</p> <p>The next morning he met her for breakfast, and he knew it had never left his mind that he was seeing her body, to touch her. He hoped he could be her friend.</p> <p>'You look good,' he said when he got to his flat; she was wearing a pair of black silk knickers and a pale blue T-shirt, that accentuated her breasts and highlighted her well shaped figure.</p> <p>'Thank you,' she grinned.</p> <p>'So who is this nice big man of mine that you have here? Is he with us?'</p> <p>'He is... I'm not really used to meeting new people...'</p> <p>'I bet he likes to look at you; don't you?'</p> <p>'I'm not sure.'</p> <p>He nodded, and they got up to leave.</p> <p>'I'd say that you have the body of a girl,' she said, as they walked away.</p> <p>'The body...'</p> <p>'But you don't know much about that. Don't bother.'</p> <p>For the next few weekends he kept coming home each time I saw them. He came to see me once on a Friday, and made an excuse to go see a movie and come back to my flat. He came out before I had finished my meal, which we had agreed they could talk about sex when they were alone. A few minutes after he had left she had been sitting up watching a sitcom, waiting for him.</p> <p>And by time he had seen her she had told her story. He asked her if she had done something or regretted it, not quite feeling that it was a good time to bring it up, but she wasn't buying it either. After they had parted she made him promise to call again whenever he could get himself under control. And I was pretty sure that he wasn't going to call. But I did.</p> <p>I had been sitting at the computer, not wanting to get up at night, or even have to face him after she had been chatting up him with another woman. The one time they had come to my flat after he had gone to bed she had been in my chair, watching the movie when he came, just thinking how great it had been, as if it had been the best night she had had in her whole life. And the rest of that evening she had been masturbating in my bed every chance she got, dreaming of what had happened to her.</p> <p>Then, when he'd turned up at her flat a few seconds after I'd watched her do it she had started to talk about going on a date with him, and telling me all about all her sex lives and all the guys she'd been with, and even going so far as to go to bed with one of them. I was stunned.</p> <p>I was so shocked... she had put on an attitude that wasn't at all like that for him. But she had taken it all in stride, and I understood when she started to actually like him. I mean it was just the sort of thing she'd have done...</p> <p>All of that went through my head one night with him, but I wasn't sure. She didn't want to admit it to me, but she kept asking me to watch him make her his fuckable girl, as to which of her friends she fancied the most.</p> <p>And that night she'd had a really big orgasm and seemed to want it repeated the next night. The whole thing took a lot out of me, like I had never experienced before.</p> <p>I had tried to get a handle on it, but was kept on denying it completely, which was just as well as I was sure he wasn't going to call again.</p> <p>When I had told her that I was going out again in a couple of weeks, she had said something different: "Well, what do you think?"</p> <p>'I don't think I'm ready for anything like that' I said, looking at the clock. 'You'd better make sure I stay over until you come back.'</p> <p>'I'll go and call again a few days, maybe.'</p> <p>Well that night he really rang me, after the initial surprise had left. It seemed more a relief to be able to tell me it was him for a bit, to tell me that he wanted to come back and fuck her.</p> <p>The next time I had to go home to meet up with him I had stayed in a hotel, as it would give me something to look forward to, if the time went right. And I had put down my plans of doing that night with him on the night that I was going to catch up with him and do something else with her. So that I wouldn't get any of his spunkâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
