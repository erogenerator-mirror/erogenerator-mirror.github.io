She loved to keep everything in line and when she was in the mood to do something she would usually give me a good seeing to. They were always pretty clean, it was like a good thing. My dad was very proud to say so.</p> <p>When I got home that night Lori always came into the bathroom when there was a movie I was watching and I could not help but stare at her. She would come over, her hair wet and her shirt buttoned up. Every time I did that I would steal a glance at her, she didn't move, she never did anything else with me, I felt like I was the luckiest kid in the world to be with her.</p> <p>I had to come out of the bathroom when we got in the car one day, we were in the parking lot.</p> <p>"How come we never see each other before?" she asked me.</p> <p>"Well I'm not doing anything with you, or taking a look, if you're really going to spend a night there alone in the dark, like you are now."</p> <p>"I just didn't expect you to be spending a night with me, you are so pretty," she said, staring at me.</p> <p>"Oh come off it you can't know that. I just don't think you should be spending tonight alone, you are pretty alone. Your mom never seems to leave the house, she doesn't sleep in the next room to bed. You are probably the only one who ever gets the urge to get a good view from her, you know."</p> <p>"Uh huh. I guess that's true, but there are a lot of people like you. When was the last time I caught a glimpse of you," she said, leaning close to me.</p> <p>"I'm not going to make that move again tonight, if we do tonight or tomorrow I might just do it." I had already told mom that I would not be out looking for her.</p> <p>"You're not going to make a move with me are you?"</p> <p>"No. As a matter of fact, I'm going to leave tomorrow, if I come back tomorrow. I'm sorry I can't stay away from you tonight."</p> <p>"There is no need for excuses, just remember I love you and I don't want to fight it. Is there?"</p> <p>"I guess there is, there is,"</p> <p>We kissed, it felt so good to be held by somebody that was not my mom. It was a soft, sweet, loving kiss and I was a little nervous. Her lips tasted so sweet too, as we always are. And as always, my tongue darted into her mouth and I could feel her body go into fits of the most powerful reaction. Her nipples hardened at the sensation, they always did when I licked or sucked on them. I think we always were very good kissers.</p> <p>"I've missed this so much," she moaned as we broke away from each other's kiss.</p> <p>"It's been a wonderful time and I can't wait till tomorrow," I said, walking over to the car.</p> <p>"Well I've got an idea that I can help you with," she said, giving my cock a quick jerk.</p> <p>"Are you sure there is no problem?" I asked.</p> <p>"Of course there is, I've never done a job before and thought that maybe it is all right in that you wouldn't mind if I did everything at your pace," Lori told me.</p> <p>"Well, it's my apartment and I didn't have any plans to be home before ten in the morning, so I just thought I'd take a shower here, before we started."</p> <p>I walked to her, turned her around and kissed her lips, our kiss was like no other kiss I've ever had with anyone. I could feel her body shiver under me as I took the lead, she was a little nervous, she had no idea how much we were going to take the day off to a point. I took off my clothes and lay on her bed, my body still wet from the shower and our time together. She was right, there was no problem taking the day off and having the rest of the day off, I was all yours any way you want it. We made love slowly, lovingly, tenderly. I could have just wanted to take her right there, not on a first date. I thought we might want to get out of the apartment and go on our separate nights out. I hoped we had already planned that we would see each other naked, or maybe come in a pair of boxers and I would be on top. She had no objection to this idea, the more I knew, the more I wanted to spend the evening with her.</p> <p>After her shower, Lori and I went straight to my room to grab a movie and we settled back to watch itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
