"I wish I didn't have to go through that...that..."</p> <p>"I didn't even realize you had to go through that. But you're going to be gone from our time together forever."</p> <p>"Me, too."</p> <p>We stood as he walked me through the door. He locked it behind us before turning to leave, "I'm going to call you tomorrow," he murmured.</p> <p>I stared at him, stunned. "No, not tomorrow. I don't need to get off of my job. Please stay with me. I love this feeling. Besides I'll see where it goes from here."</p> <p>"I'll never leave you," he said, and turned, "I'll see you tomorrow." With that, he left, closing the door behind him with a small click.</p> <p>I was already on my way to the shower...I could almost wait to start.</p> <p>The water from my shower felt cool and soothing against my tender body, "Where do I start again?" I asked as I rinsed off the last of my suds. I leaned back, my mind still reeling from the events of the last hour.</p> <p>I heard his voice in my head, "Go down" and then the bathroom door opened and then closed. A few moments later, I heard a woman's voice. "Hi, my name is Toni." I could hardly breathe, I felt like I was about to pass out from dehydration. Who the hell was standing in my house, staring at me naked before me? Toni was the first one to speak, "I'm so sorry..." There was no other response. The door opened and closed, and I could still hear the sound of skin against skin. At first she was just standing there, but gradually her body turned revealing herself. I was hypnotized again. Toni was tall, very tall. Her light skin was a very pale porcelain, with just a touch of a brown, but, even then, she still had the beautiful glow of youth about her. Her nipples were small and pouty. She had an almost non-existent mound of soft, dark black hair. Her legs were firm, just slightly longer than mine. She stood in a semi-transparent bra and pantyhose that were almost transparent. Her skin looked smooth and pale, she wore a short, tight-fitting black dress that fit her perfectly, not seeming to be designed for the sun. Even as she lifted her heels, she still had a tiny, dark patch of dark hair between her legs. Her breasts, as though they had a mind of their own, sagged a little, but were still perfect. They were not large, but they seemed even larger than mine in stature. Her skin, like her hands, was tanned and flawless, so smooth as her hands rubbed on the cold porcelain surface.</p> <p>"I'm sorry too, it was just this..." she started, then paused. "Your first time and how you handled it. I thought maybe my hands were dry..."</p> <p>This was unbelievable! she began again, "I know I'm married now..."</p> <p>"Yes, I understand..." came his voice, "But no, you don't have to marry, if you don't want to."</p> <p>My mind raced as I looked out of the open bathroom door for that next step, thinking he just wanted to fuck me. Was he just looking for permission from me?!?!!! How in the world could he have done this to me????!! Was it just because I'd had some strange feelings for someone?????????? I sat at my desk, a place I had never been before. My mind screamed at me, "This is wrong, what have you done? What have I let myself in?".</p> <p>"Just because you like to dress up too much doesn't mean you don't enjoy it." he said with a sigh.</p> <p>"I haven't done anything wrong," I said, "I feel good at the same time."</p> <p>"I know", he said, "you look great. And I have been looking forward to being your first. Maybe we'll start a regular relationship later, won't we," he added with a smile.</p> <p>I couldn't speak. I just stood there in front of the shower, "I...I'm sorry," I mumbled. I felt like such an idiot. I don't blame you, you had better take care of yourself.</p> <p>It took several minutes for Toni to calm down enough to leave the bathroom. She looked around her, then back at me with a puzzled expression on her face.</p> <p>"How can you be so calm?" she asked.</p> <p>"Toni?" I saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
