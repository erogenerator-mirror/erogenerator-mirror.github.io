After a few minutes she found herself thinking, 'Why shouldn't he just fuck my brains out, he's never going to get anything from me, he will never get me like I deserve.'</p> <p>The thought of her husband pounding her pussy all day and waking her up to the latest episode of her life sent a wave of panic over her to her core. The image of a cock stretching and hurting her pussy sent out a wave of arousal over her.</p> <p>She felt like she wanted to cry, but couldn't. After an agonizing few minutes the pain began to subside, and she was able to relax.</p> <p>"Ok." She said.</p> <p>"Good." He responded.</p> <p>He began to massage her shoulders and said "You are the most beautiful girl on earth. I could give you the best massage that you ever imagined. I've had hundreds of massage sessions that I made up, but not so many you couldn't handle the full treatment."</p> <p>She looked into his eyes, and saw a wild look of excitement and adoration. He turned her face toward him and kissed her again. She accepted his kiss; that kiss made her pussy tingle again. He began to suck her tongue and lips, and she felt the urge return. It wasn't like before, but she was feeling better now. It wasn't bad, just like before. She was able to feel her pussy responding to his touch without feeling guilty.</p> <p>He had her on her knees on the floor, and he entered into her from behind. She felt his cock rub against her cervix and she was lost in her desire. She looked into his eyes as he pumped his cock into her.</p> <p>He grabbed her hair and pulled her upright, and they both moaned in pleasure. They were both lost in the moment, not sure what was happening next, and it didn't take long for him to empty his load in her pussy. After they recovered a few minutes, they dressed and looked at each other.</p> <p>"That would be very nice." she said.</p> <p>"Good. My number is 555-5555!" he replied, smiling.</p> <p>"Next time." she said before kissing him.</p> <p><><><></p> <p>They both enjoyed it, with him using her body as their personal toy. They took turns making out on his sofa; her hands stroking his cock. She didn't have to masturbate him, because he was already hard, but she was so aroused she had to play with herself while he watched.</p> <p>After the episode, she didn't want to give him up so easily when it was coming to an end. She made it clear she felt a guilt feeling in her chest as she watched them finish. She wanted him to stop, but she didn't know if he would. Part of her wondered if he would ever let her go. She made a conscious decision to let him have his way with her body.</p> <p>And as she watched him finish he came on her. She had stopped masturbating until it felt like two minutes. When he pulled out her hand was sticky, and she could smell her own juices on her fingers. She leaned back against him and kissed him, and she felt his load run down her pussy from her pussy to her ass. She took it in her mouth savoring all of their lovemaking.</p> <p><><><></p> <p>She awoke feeling wonderful as she got up from the sofa and ran into the bathroom. She washed herself and rinsed herself in the shower before washing herself some more. It was the moment a woman wants to remember, but isn't sure if that's what a woman wants to do. It certainly felt good, if a little crazy. She was definitely different. For the first time in her life she wasn't worried if someone else heard of her. She felt she needed to tell someone anyway.</p> <p>She came out of the bathroom and smiled as she thought of the fun she had today. She had no plans of going anywhere after today. She was just going to stay home and enjoy the beach in the city. She really missed the sun, and the ocean in the ocean.</p> <p>She went up to her room and took out the phone. "Hello?"</p> <p>"Hey there. This is Mike. It's Kay, and you're not going to believe what happened last night."</p> <p>Kay was surprised to hear from her former master. "I can hardly believe what happened."</p> <p>"Oh. Well, I'm not happy with your story, but that's ok. Anyway, I hope we can get together for a quickie before we go any further. And if you have a problem seeing me again, I can talk to you."</p> <p>"Umm, ok. I guessâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
