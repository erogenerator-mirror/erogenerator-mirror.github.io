He loves me for sure."</p> <p>"But you don't like him anymore, do you?"</p> <p>"Don't worry," she said and smiled, "I'm sure you'll like this. I think I'll take his cherry today."</p> <p>"Oh, my goodness! That is so cool. How much?"</p> <p>"Don't worry, I'll buy you a new one this year."</p> <p>"You know, one of the most amazing experiences of your life is buying sex toys. Don't tell me you have another one in your house."</p> <p>"I'm not sure. It was only yesterday on the pill. You don't need anything to get me pregnant with my own baby."</p> <p>He smiled and leaned down close to her ear, "I'm sure you can figure out how to get him. He can use a magic wand on you, if he wants, then you can use a real one on him."</p> <p>"You do that very well, and you're very attractive, too."</p> <p>His hand cupped her cheek and held her tenderly. His eyes locked with those of a child, knowing full well what he wanted from her. He knew she loved a young man and she was eager for him to show her his love and submission.</p> <p>"Come on, I thought as much. Besides, there's something else I want to show you."</p> <p>She turned and faced him, letting him lead her upstairs to the bedroom. Inside, she placed the wand upon the dresser and pulled on one piece of the lacy, satin and silk robe. The robe revealed her nakedness and she held it out for him, letting him take it off. His eyes devoured her body, but he paid attention to her breasts. They were large now, but they would never be small now. They still stood at their full width when erect. They were so firm and high. Then she saw he looked down at the smooth, flawless curves of her crotch. Her legs were smooth and long and her feet were smooth, almost white. They were so long that they almost looked black. Her pubic hair was dark, short and wavy. She had it trimmed into a narrow strip that led up to her pussy. She stepped back to the bed, sat on the edge and motioned for him to take off the robe. He pulled it off his body and tossed it down onto the chair back. His dick stood proudly in the warm room. She walked over to him, sitting on the edge, and gently kissed him once on the mouth.</p> <p>"You taste great. Are you sure you're ready for this?" she asked him, knowing what he was asking.</p> <p>He nodded and pulled her to him and pushed her down onto the bed. He began to rub his hands over her body as he kissed her. He moved over her, rubbing her nipples before kissing her in the sweet valley between her legs. He stopped for a moment and kissed his way up her stomach until his face was level with her pussy. He took off his clothing and pulled off his robe and let it fall to the ground. She opened her legs for him, as he knelt before her. His eyes took in the beauty of her sex. Her dark pubic hair was trimmed short, but her lips were long and full. Her clit stood out proudly from her lips, begging to be licked.</p> <p>Without saying anything, she motioned him to move to her. His body was quaking as he moved with her, licking her inner thighs and tonguing her pussy. He knew she loved it when he did that. She began to groan as his tongue touched her clit. She felt his dick rub against her thigh as his lips covered her pussy. Her legs wrapped themselves around his head as he began to lick and tease and tease and suck on her clit. He was amazed by how erotic it all was. He had expected less but now it was just the same. He loved her taste and her smell and her taste and the way her body shuddered and shivered and shook with pleasure.</p> <p>Her pussy was dripping with her juices as he kept at a steady pace, kissing her thighs and clit. He stopped and stood up, positioning himself behind her.</p> <p>"I want to take you into my bed," he whispered into her ear.</p> <p>He pulled the robe off her body and let it puddle on the carpeted floor. He moved into position behind her. His dick, wet with her juices, was at her entrance. She knew what was expected. He leaned forward and pushed himself into her. He moved slowly and was amazed how tight she felt. He loved the way it felt for him. She felt so tight around his dick as he slid it in and out of her body. He moved in and out slowly as he enjoyed the sight of his beautiful woman being fucked this way.</p> <p>Forâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
