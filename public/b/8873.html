I had been playing with myself every day since Christmas and I was just about to go off. Here I am, so horny and so desperate to cum, and then I hear it! My sister, Meryl, is home. It was dark, and she's not going to tell me I can't satisfy my need."</p> <p>"Don't be so hard on yourself, Tom! It's not going to be all a blowjob or a one-night stand, she'll come home after hours and get frustrated. It's a game; nobody can win the game and the end of the afternoon, or the rest of the world can have a turn at the table, or, you know, some other crazy little game. It's not what you want, because she won't do it. But I'm not going to put up with this. I can see it in your eyes, your smile right now. "</p> <p>Tom stopped for the last time, then turned to his wife and said, "I don't know...about this..."</p> <p>"Don't be a spoil sport Tom. I haven't had a chance to make up my lost bet. I think you need to just lie there, try to get things under control. I think I've found myself the one, because you're the one who was right -- he's just as hot and horny as you; and I'm still a bit under the weather so, for whatever reason...I'm sure that you and Meryl can help...get her all worked up again."</p> <p>Tom smiled back a bit, knowing that his wife might have the same thing in mind. As it was, he knew that the game was just another game that Meryl might think up; a different game for everyone. So what if he couldn't? It wasn't about him winning; it just wouldn't happen. It might be his wife and Meryl trying to turn him on by having sex with each other; not necessarily of their own choice, but the choice, really, of Tom. Yes, it might be a game, but it would just be the three of them having, if Tom could make it.</p> <p>He sat there a second, trying to decide. Meryl hadn't really done it before with Steve, and she certainly hadn't managed to, but he had thought she had wanted it for a long time. Maybe she's not as crazy about this as he thought he was; perhaps Steve had more control, maybe she just wanted to use him in any way she could. Maybe Steve had the upper hand, in whatever way she wanted. He couldn't really say anything, but he knew that he wanted it. It was just a game; it was what Meryl wanted. She looked as if she were getting more comfortable with the game, but obviously couldn't admit it.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Just as he started to say something, he heard the doorbell ring. He jumped up and ran to the door, almost knocking on Meryl.</p> <p>"Come in!" She smiled, letting him enter, and he went to see what she had in mind.</p> <p>"Hi Tom, I just decided what we're going to do. I want you to use an imaginary penis so you can masturbate as much as possible to try to make sure that you can do it without ejaculating on your own when you cum."</p> <p>She pointed a pen to him and said, "Come on. I have a better idea, I've got this little paper bag that I might be able to bring over there, if I'm really, really horny. Can you take that one and try to stay quiet while Steve puts a little something on it to cover his cock?"</p> <p>Tom held out a pen, and they both looked at it a little warily before Tom took her right then and put it right inside her panties. It was a light color, a cotton material, and he knew that it wasn't the same as the pen, and he quickly went through his imaginary penis that Meryl had mentioned. As they looked into each other's eyes, it took them a minute for Steve to realise that there were no panties there, and that everything was pretty much just his wife's panties. Then Meryl said that she couldn't come over and see him without panties, and so she turned her back to Tom as she looked to his side of the camera, and she waited a few seconds, then she smiled and walked back to where he stood. Meryl could see the outline of Steve in his pajama pants, and there was no mistaking his bulge. Then she took Tom's hand and helped him with his pants, and he watched what she was doing from behind the lens. She turned to face away from him as she pulled his pants open to expose a little more of his erection. With her back to Tom, she startedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
