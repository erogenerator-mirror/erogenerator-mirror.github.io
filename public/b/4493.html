I smiled as I placed the ice into her drink. She sipped and swallowed as she leaned back against my legs.</p> <p>"I've been thinking, how much did you have in mind? We were talking about what you wanted for us all. I already did with you how many guys I should let be. All I got was six, how many are left?" she said in a matter of fact voice.</p> <p>"I'd like you to try it. Are you up for this? If not, I can help as well as give you a hand."</p> <p>With that I lifted her up under my arm and carried her over to the couch. She sat down and I sat down next to her. I started with slowly sliding the ice over her nipple.</p> <p>"OH my. That feels amazing." she said out load. I pulled a little away and started by slowly kissing her face. She put her hand over mine as I slowly worked it down over her stomach toward her mound.</p> <p>"What do you think?" I asked as I slid two fingers inside her pussy. I felt for her lips as I got back up to her chest. Her eyes stared at me as my fingers slid into her and I pulled them out again, this time licking the juice from the tip.</p> <p>"OH that feels so nice." she said. I continued to slide my fingers into her and was met with her hips as she leaned back against me. When she leaned back I let my hands slide down her body and I held them there lightly as she leaned forward, putting my fingers in as I started to slide them in and out of her pussy with her.</p> <p>"Oh, yes. I think you're going to make me cum. I've been thinking about doing this for so long." she said as I felt her start to shake. I was able to get the fingers of one hand working in and out as I slid over her lips with my fingers in her pussy. Her hips lifted against me as I slid the finger in and out, fucking her as her legs opened to take me all the way in again.</p> <p>"I think it's your turn." I said as I kept sliding in and out of her. After a few seconds of her legs getting wet, I put both hands on her legs and lifted them up, holding her with them. Again I kept sliding in and out of her as her hips shook.</p> <p>"Ahh." she almost screamed as her body went stiff. As her orgasm started to subside I pulled the fingers from her pussy and pulled my fingers out as I moved over to the side.</p> <p>"We can do this again." she said, with a smile. I smiled back. It would be nice to have a steady threesome. This could be fun for sure.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>If you liked this story feel free to email meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
