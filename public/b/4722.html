Let me get the door," I said.</p> <p>"OK, go on home and I'll put you up," she said. I was still trying to get my clothes back on when my boss' wife arrived. She opened the door to find me in just a pajama bottom. She made no move to put my shoes away from me. I got my jeans on quickly. I tried to keep my head bowed a little. It showed my embarrassment. She had a slight smile on her face. She had an eyebrow raised.</p> <p>"Hi, Daddy. How was your meeting?"</p> <p>I took her hand and gave it a light squeeze. This felt better than I could do. I gave her a big hug. It gave me the opportunity I thought I would have never been able to get away with. She took her hand off my shoulder and gave me a long kiss as she hugged me. It went all the way to the point where I felt she may have to break it off.</p> <p>"That was fantastic, sweetheart. You were wonderful and that just increased my excitement. You're a very special woman. I hope you don't have to go that way anymore," I said, almost embarrassed.</p> <p>"I hope not," she said and moved to the door. She turned and winked at me while she passed.</p> <p>"Let me show you something," I said as I followed her. I followed her into her bedroom. I could barely keep my eyes away from what we were about to do. Even more so, it was turning me on. I wanted to go and kiss her. I wanted to see her pussy and feel her ass. I wanted to make love to her. I wanted to give those things to her as well.</p> <p>She stopped when she saw my disappointment. She looked deeply in my eyes.</p> <p>"You don't mind if I stay, Daddy. I wouldn't want to leave my bed." What I wasn't prepared for was her next words. "I'm not going to leave you here, daddy. I want that big cock to come in me and fuck me and make me scream. We can't do that because my husband will kill us, I'm sorry."</p> <p>"No it's not that. You're right, sweetheart, but he's too busy now."</p> <p>She smiled and hugged me again. I held her face and we kissed. Her tongue found my tongue as my fingers found her ass. We melted in each other's arms and kissed.</p> <p>"God, you're so beautiful and sweet," I told her as my arms circled her. Her legs were on either side of mine and we both began making out. Her lips were soft and wet when I sucked on them. I wanted to feel them on my cock. Her tongue was hot and wet. Our mouths and tongues swirled as we kissed and moaned into each other.</p> <p>The hand that had been fingering my cock began pulling my shaft while our kissing grew more fervent. The kiss became wilder and faster. I was almost ready to cum. The kissing and fondling was too much. We went from moaning into each other's mouths as we kissed and groped.</p> <p>"God, I'm getting close," I said to her, reaching between our bodies. "Here, let me get them, please."</p> <p>I lifted her ass as her legs pulled mine closer. We were locked in a perfect lip lock when she broke our kiss. She smiled at me.</p> <p>"Come on, Daddy, let me suck you before you do it yourself. My pussy can't wait."</p> <p>I was already about to move so she took the opportunity to move her lips to my cock. I knew I was the one moaning. I was right. She took my manhood into her mouth and began sucking. I put my hands on her head and began thrusting. She moved her hands to my ass while she sucked. Her tongue was everywhere under the covers; my balls, my ass, my back, even my neck. She was making wet sucking noises on my cock. I knew I was getting close. I pulled her head away so I could watch her face. There was a look of ecstasy and lust on her face. She had those eyes when I was driving and then there was something else. It was like a part was in her body that made her very sexy to me. I was going to ask her to eat me as well.</p> <p>It was a beautiful orgasm. Each wave of passion was new and exciting. I felt my orgasm building. I grabbed her and pulled her close. We broke our kiss so we could breathe. She smiled at me as I did.</p> <p>"How's the bed?" she asked as she moved her tongue around my lips. I nodded as I didâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
