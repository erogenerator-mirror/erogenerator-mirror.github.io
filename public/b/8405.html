I love it."</p> <p>"It never gets too comfortable. You know that, right?"</p> <p>"I've got that, baby. I was always a wild, crazy one back by the sea."</p> <p>We finally sat down and made a drink. The music played and we listened. When there was enough light in the room, I told her to go get dressed. I told her to get out of there and to wait for me in one of the spare bedrooms. She sat down with me and we talked.</p> <p>"I love you," I told her, "I'm your first and only. I never thought it would be this good and...</p> <p>"If you need a little encouragement, just say I know," she said, "and I'll do the rest."</p> <p>"Do you have enough to carry?" I joked.</p> <p>"You're the first."</p> <p>I went into the bedroom and dressed for dinner. It was a nice, romantic, Italian meal. It was fantastic, and it lasted for hours when we finished. We didn't talk about ourselves, but at least we didn't keep things personal.</p> <p>After dinner, we stood outside in our bathing suits. We both had on tops that had straps from the top to the bottom. We pulled the straps off each other's shoulders, and then each other's bottoms.</p> <p>"Now, we're both nude. Why don't we start the fire in the fireplace? I think that might be better, because we're both hot, so we'd get a nice fire going in front of the fire."</p> <p>We walked into the room, with the three candles blazing. The fire licked out the curtains. We slowly undressed each other, until we were lying on our sides and facing each other. We began to kiss. We had just made our way to the sofa for some light, when my phone started to ring.</p> <p>"That's your husband," I said. I couldn't tell if it was a joke, but I didn't care. My hands went to her bare shoulders and down to her butt. I began to stroke it gently. She let my fingers wander a little before she took a step to answer it.</p> <p>"Hi, it's me," she said, "How's your day going?"</p> <p>"It's going okay," I told her.</p> <p>"Can you come over here for a while? I don't want to wait until you're ready for a night or two."</p> <p>"I'd like that."</p> <p>"Let me finish."</p> <p>"I'll do that."</p> <p>She stood up, dropped down on her knees in front of me, and then lifted me, kissing me with all the love I was feeling for her.</p> <p>She stood back and kissed me again, passionately. Then she took off her robe, dropped to her knees, and then pushed it to the side. Her breasts were beautiful. I'd never had a woman that large, but she had perfect breasts like mine. I could see her nipples sticking out through her top, so I leaned forward and took one into my mouth. I began to lick and suck it, working my way down to the bottom and back up again. She began to move her hips gently, pushing them forward so they rubbed against my dick.</p> <p>It wasn't long then before she said, "Lie down on the bed and I'll be right back." I got on my back. She got on her hands and knees in front of me, her breasts pointing upwards.</p> <p>When she returned, she straddled my hips. In her hands, she pulled the waist line of her bottoms to the side and then slowly slid them down. When I began to feel the head of my dick, she stopped and looked down. She said, "I'm sorry I made up my mind that we were going to take it slow."</p> <p>"No, you weren't. It was just a little bit, but you did it."</p> <p>"I really want to do it slow. I've never done anything like this before. I don't know if I could do it."</p> <p>"Neither has I, but I'll get you started, honey. I'm getting hot too and I don't want to move."</p> <p>Slowly, slowly, I slid forward, until my dick was pressed against her lower stomach. I began to move my hips as I felt her begin to press back. She was so soft. I could feel her legs against my upper thighs. It was like her pussy was actually touching the head of my dick. I began to move my hips in and out, and her body began to move with me. I could hear it making a slurâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
