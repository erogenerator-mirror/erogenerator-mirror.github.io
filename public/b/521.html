I never said such a thing."</p> <p>"The one with that ass that he loves to stick in, doesn't he?"</p> <p>Dina shook her head. "Not quite. He just loves to stick his dick up a girl's ass, and that's pretty much how I'm doing."</p> <p>"I like it when you play up the girl. It makes me feel so sexy."</p> <p>"Not every girl likes to be butt fucked, sweetie. Some will love it too. Some will admit it to themselves, but the majority will not. I only ask, because it's just who I am and I love you from the beginning. We'll never have to do this."</p> <p>"The whole world will see my ass now," she said, sitting up on the bed. "I thought that you were still going to let me take care of you," she said with one eye on me.</p> <p>I was surprised. Not just at her, but the fact that she had started telling me about my past sexual experience, telling me that it was the closest thing to what she has always wanted. It made me feel a little better after getting her to tell me. I had almost forgotten, I guess.</p> <p>"You are absolutely right," she whispered. She gave me another wicked smile and walked around to the foot of the bed, leaning over me. I got a good look at her lovely body as she slid the covers off of me. Then I was surprised again by the fact that she didn't even take off the panties that she had always wanted me to see me in.</p> <p>She was still leaning over me, her huge breasts just inches from me. She ran her hands over my stomach once more and up to my nipples. The sensation of having her skin so close to me was just too much.</p> <p>"Mmm, this is nice," I told her, and she gave me a mischievous smile.</p> <p>She gave me that devilish grin again. "Don't you look so good. I've been dreaming about this for so long, even though I haven't actually done it."</p> <p>"So has mine," I said with a laugh, enjoying the softness of her soft lips and the little nip that she was giving me. The smell of her hair mixed with her scent was intoxicating.</p> <p>She was still leaning over me and she slowly stroked my nipples as she rubbed my nipples with her fingers, teasing them just a little. She leaned down and began to kiss my neck.</p> <p>"Mmm, no touching. There's something important that I'd like to do later before I do this," she said.</p> <p>"I see."</p> <p>She reached between my legs and began to rub my slit through my undies while teasing my nipples with her fingertip.</p> <p>"Oh, I like a lot of things that your boyfriends are going to do to you," she said, and then kissed me again. "It's what this is. Do you want to take care of your girlfriend?"</p> <p>"Anything you ask," I told her.</p> <p>"I'm not a girlfriend, but I could always do whatever you wanted me to do, if you want."</p> <p>"I want you to do me too," she breathed, before turning her head as she looked at me.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm serious," I told her while I rolled onto my back and spread my legs wide.</p> <p>"Good. I like that idea," she said, and she slipped her fingers inside her underwear as she leaned over me. "Let's wait a little."</p> <p>She looked down at me and then looked back up at me, before running her tongue along her lips. She looked so beautiful. She kept licking at me like this for a minute, and then she slipped her hand inside her underwear and rubbed her pussy a little.</p> <p>"Like that?" she asked, before slipping her finger inside of her, just feeling the tight heat of inside.</p> <p>"Do you want to do that?" she asked with a smile.</p> <p>"Just a little. I love playing with myself, because it's the perfect thing for us," I told her, as I pulled the sheets down from my head and rolled onto my side so that we could be comfortable.</p> <p>"Just keep teasing me, it'll be fun."</p> <p>"How about you?" I asked, putting my hand next to her head. "You're always so easy."</p> <p>"I just love to play with my own clit. No one gets to make me come unless I use mine."</p> <p>I couldn't believe that it felt so wonderful having a tongue working on my clit. It's not like I'd ever done anything sexual with anyone other than Tina or any of my girlfriends. I liked making love to her and watching her experience the joy of letting someone else pleasure herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
