We had the next couple of hours and it was time to get out of this damn thing.</p> <p>"That's so sweet of you, sweetie," I said as I helped her up. "I really wanted to do that."</p> <p>"Yeah," she said, "I was worried that my boobs would just pop out of habit. But we actually kind of liked it. But then my nipples got a little sore. And they were a little sore, too." That made her giggle. "I hope you don't mind the soreness."</p> <p>"Not at all, sweetie," I said, "Just to be sure that we didn't hurt you." I felt her hand slide over my thigh. "You've got a lot to show me, sweetheart. Come on, let's take something to the bathroom so we can shower. We don't want anyone coming in."</p> <p>While we were gone, she leaned over and planted a big kiss on my lips. Then she started unbuttoning my pants. I wasn't wearing underpants. She went into the bathroom to close the door. When she turned the water to our special mode, she stood me in the tub facing her. I leaned forward and started running my hand up and down her left leg. She moaned and moved her hands around my waist.</p> <p>"If I'd known I could make you feel this good the way I made you feel...and you were so grateful, I would have been doing a lot more to you when we got together. Just remember, dear...always be ready." And I left her standing there naked, just looking at her smiling face.</p> <p>She didn't come back out when we got in the shower. That's ok, because I had a whole other set of things to put on the list: getting clean, shaving our legs, shaving our ass, and more intimate parts....ohhhh.</p> <p>That night, when we were in bed and she was snuggled up to me, I realized that she had an unusually wet pussy, and it would probably be a good thing we'd get to sleep in separate beds. I was going to have to think hard about that.</p> <p>Afterward that evening, while the girls were at work, we cuddled up together and played. I'd played and watched a little last night but only kissed her gently and didn't really go into it. But it felt nice and we were pretty sure that no one would see us. And, oh god, I really did want to do that. I had no idea at all whether there was any other way that I'd be doing it.</p> <p>I made sure I was really close to her in the bed. I'd been wearing a flannel night shirt and I realized that I'd gotten a big erection in the midst of our kissing. We'd been doing this, well, for quite some time but I'd felt so hot for her that I'd even decided that she was hot too.</p> <p>This time, I was really happy how much she was really turning out. There wasn't any guilt in it anymore. Just being that I'd been very wrong at first. I wasn't sure whether I had really cheated on Amy, and maybe I hadn't, but I couldn't stop myself from getting that hardon and thinking about how hot and how good she was.</p> <p>Even my own hardon was getting a pretty strong twitch of excitement as I did my thinking. The fact that I was lying in front of her as she was laying back on the pillows as naked as I was, and that my face was right next to hers, was really having its effect. I just couldn't get enough of that.</p> <p>Suddenly, she was leaning her chest to my and I slipped my arm around her. "It's ok, sweetie. I still really enjoy touching you," I whispered. There was no way I was moving away so fast. And she didn't seem to mind at all whether I was caressing and fondling her breasts or whether I was caressing her ass at the same time.</p> <p>We made love twice, both more than once, but the fact that I knew we'd be alone in the bed, that it was just sex, that nothing else mattered, was the real thrill. All I could think about was my cock pressing against her body. And I couldn't think of any other way to describe to her how much of a turn on it made me to have her as naked as I was.</p> <p>It was a little after midnight when I woke up. It was a cold, rainy day but it felt like a good day to me. I went to the bathroom and splashed some on face—just in case Amy got pissed. There was no way I was going to be able to sleep without touching her. I needed to do something, to make my hardness go down, to—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
