My back arched in ecstasy, and then I spasmed, almost instantly I could feel my back arching off the ground as my orgasm shook me in my loins. And once it passed I was left panting and gasping for breath. I was gasping for breath, as well, as was a man I had just met, and I could barely make myself presentable.</p> <p>"Wow" I told myself as I looked over to my lover. He was standing close to me in the living room, his right arm outstretched, his left hand running through his hair, a smile on his face. He was fully clothed in another suit, and there was little to grab onto as he looked over my body. He was obviously ready, as his arms were folded neatly on the couch.</p> <p>We stood there holding our breath, unsure how to begin this new adventure. What was I thinking? Why was I watching this stranger's body move within his embrace like I was? I tried to figure out if I really was watching one of my dreams. My hand had never truly left my groin... so I must have been quite in awe of this man when I had first found him in my dreams. The thought of watching him again turned me on just thinking about it.</p> <p>After another minute passed I glanced up to his face, and there was a brief look of concern on his face as he pulled away. The look didn't tell me that he had missed me staring at his body, I had only noticed more his well defined jaw line as he spoke. I think we both expected him to stop for the second word he said. I shook my head and said, "I'm fine". The first thing he said was, "So you want to join me for a drink?" He pulled his suit coat tighter around his shoulders as he took me by the hand. I walked towards him as he pulled my hand towards his. We turned to leave, and as we entered my mind started wandering again. I found myself wondering what it would be like to do what I had just done with him. There were more questions I could answer... but there was too much to think of.</p> <p>In the living room, with the rest of the bar surrounding him, they were seated on either side of me. There were beers on the bar, though the beer was still empty. I couldn't stop staring at him, trying to decide if it was really me there with the man in his arms... or was this man...</p> <p>The silence in the bar was broken by loud male laughter and laughter, though it was mostly male voices. The sound of female laughter could be heard in the bar, as well. A couple women were dancing, with several others. That could be me, but I didn't know who it was. I had not seen many woman tonight, not that there had been many women here, but just one or two. I could already smell the smell of the beer.</p> <p>The bartender smiled at me and said, "You must be thirsty" and handed me a glass in front of him. I took a sip of it, trying my best to act normal. It did nothing but make me more aroused as I finished up the bottle. We sat on the couch again, and as we leaned in to each other I looked down as he was sitting across from me. When he saw me looking at him with interest, he smiled at me. I'm not sure why, but the sight of this man staring into my eyes, made me want him... and I found myself wanting to know what it would be like to be with him again.</p> <p>He turned away from me and pulled the chair away. I followed suit. I looked at him curiously as I reached for my beer. "What brings this on?" We were sitting down in the center of the couch again, and as I looked at him, he leaned forward and took the glass back from me.</p> <p>"I am not sure how I'm going to begin this conversation" I told him.</p> <p>He smiled as he took on of me of his right hand, and continued, "No. I do not think I'm going to be able to answer your question on the second date" He spoke as he took a swallow of his beer. "As you will see, with my permission I will be able to tell you whatever I desire, without any effort."</p> <p>My eyes widened in shock. "But I didn't know you were..." As he spoke his hand was shaking slightly, and the tone of his voice told me he knew it wasn't true. He didn't move as he looked at me for a brief moment, and then he was back, his body leaning into mine. Without saying anything I leaned my body against his. With the motion of his leg, my dress rode up slightly. There was no point in not being honest, Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
