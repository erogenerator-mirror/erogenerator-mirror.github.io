He had been in control of himself for far too long. She was ready to see what it was and if he didn't want this she would take it too. His breath was becoming uneven as he whispered.</p> <p>"Watching."</p> <p>This was so very intense. He was about to have his last orgasm. He looked up at her face to know she would be watching and he couldn't deny her as he said it.</p> <p>"You want me to watch?"</p> <p>Her hands on his shoulders pushed his shoulders back. He leaned back until his head was turned to her, her eyes locking onto his as she reached out and touched his face. His hands moved over her face as she slowly leaned closer to him, her head on his shoulder. The cool air of the blanket against his cheek sent chills down his spine as he felt a soft gentle touch on his arm from behind. He knew her hand was on the small of his shoulder as she leaned closer. Her eyes moved up and down him as she looked at him and he could tell that she was studying him. He had a beautiful face and she was studying it closely and his reaction to her was immediate and obvious.</p> <p>They turned to walk towards the front of the cab as he felt her hand on his and she walked into his arms. As she held him she felt his hand slide down and over her stomach and she shivered as his fingers found her clit and began to stroke it gently as they stood like that. For a moment they were still and she stood waiting for him to take his hand away but he didn't. His fingers still touching her clit and his fingers still teasing her. He couldn't stand the suspense any longer. His hand moved up to her face and his fingertips touched her lips lightly before sliding back down her body. His fingers moved back to her and she lifted her lips to him again. He kissed her passionately as he felt her hand on his chest. His hand slid up her body and pulled her tight to him as he felt her breasts pressing against his chest. His fingers explored again her body and moved up to her neck, where his thumb gently traced over the area of her skin.</p> <p>He was about to go back inside of her when he felt her hand on his crotch. He could feel himself hardening as she rubbed over his cock. He had never been with a woman this close before, but his body was reacting to the touch of this beautiful woman and he couldn't even stop himself from responding as she slowly pulled his cock free. He held his breath as she slowly moved away from him.</p> <p>"What do you think? Are you ready to do this?"</p> <p>"I've never done it before but I was looking for something else." Her hand slid up his chest and he felt her fingers reach out from under his shirt, touching him as she moved his shirt up and over his head.</p> <p>"Take them off." He said as he watched her eyes. She reached around and undid each button on his shirt and slid the shirt off and off of him. She held it close to her as she looked at him from under her lashes. He stood there in this woman's underwear from just outside in the crisp morning air. He looked more than a little nervous as her eyes took him in and he saw her desire mirrored his. He could tell that she was staring at him as he was looking at her.</p> <p>She smiled at him. "You're not nervous are you?" His answer was to pull her against him and he could feel his cock sliding between her legs as he wrapped them around his waist and pushed against her.</p> <p>"Let me show you what you were missing last night but you might find it hard to take."</p> <p>"Are you sure you know how to do this? I mean I couldn't make the connection to you last night."</p> <p>She moved against him slowly as she leaned back against her seat. She smiled up at him. "I guess we both have that problem of being in a dark situation. I'm going to let you lead the way then but your choices are entirely up to you. I am going to lead the way."</p> <p>He smiled again and pulled her close to him. Her breasts pressed against him as they stood there. Their kiss was electric. Their bodies rubbed together as they felt the heat of each other slowly burning up into them. Her hands moved down his arms to his shoulders and slid up and down as she ran her fingers through his hair. She leaned her head back to look into his eyes and then leaned into his neck. She was leaning back on her hands as her body moved against his. Her feet on the floor and her feet on the picnic blanket.
