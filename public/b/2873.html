Slowly, we pulled off our shirts and dropped our pants, slowly he began sliding his body up mine while I gently stroked his chest. With one, he laid me down upon the bed, kissing me fully before he began nibbling on my shoulders.</p> <p>Once he started working his way down my body, he stopped at my breasts to take each one in his mouth, kissing it before he licked the hardening nipple that had been teasing him for the past few hours. As he sucked gently upon my breast, his hands moved up my sides to my breasts feeling their softness in his hands. I was in heaven and I could hear my heart pounding in my ears as his tongue began to circle and play with the small nubs that protruded from my breasts. I moaned softly in ecstasy. He continued for a few minutes before he moved up kissing my mouth with his tongue and moving his lips lower to my nipples.</p> <p>When he moved again, my nipples were sticking erect through my bra. He moved down my abdomen to the waistband of my panties. Slowly, he kissed a line across my belly button before slowly moving further to the top of that line, pausing to nibble on it ever so slightly.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful."</p> <p>Sitting with my legs spread wide, I could feel my juices beginning to run down my thighs, and as he slowly pulled the panties down and over my legs I could feel the tip of his tongue slowly moving along my pussy lips. My hips were starting to move with his tongue as he licked up and down my slit. It had taken me so many months to become this hot and wet before, I couldn't believe how I was feeling at the moment. I had thought I was having a good time, but as his tongue continued to tease my clit, his finger quickly found its way through my wetness and began to slide in and out of me quickly. His tongue lapped up and down my lips as his finger probed each hole. I began to grind my hips against his hand as my arousal was growing.</p> <p>"Oh God" I thought as his tongue continued to massage my clit. "I am going to cum"</p> <p>He inserted another finger into me while his tongue continued to lap at my clit. I reached down between my thighs and placed my hands on his shoulders for support as I began to gyrate my hips with each wave of pleasure. I felt every muscle in my body go rigid as my climax washed over me. It was more intense than I thought it would be. It just continued to sweep over me, leaving me breathless and on the edge of an incredible level of orgasmic bliss.</p> <p>I closed my eyes as it happened again, just before I fell asleep. I felt his finger penetrate me a little deeper this time, but I wasn't ready for him to enter me. He stopped. I opened my eyes to his face in the darkness as he whispered in my ear.</p> <p>"I love when you cum"</p> <p>Then he began to slide his cock into me slowly. I opened my eyes and smiled as he entered me fully. It was the sweetest feeling I had ever felt. He slid in and out of me slowly, pulling off just a fraction every time, and then sliding back into me with a sense of urgency. I was on the verge of another orgasm and realized that I couldn't even stop myself from reaching down to pull him in close to me as he drove me toward my second orgasm.</p> <p>As I started to move against him, begging for his cock to come out, I realized what I wanted, and was almost ashamed that I needed it to do. I reached between us and began to massage his cock and balls as he slid in and out. I tried to find the best place to have his cock in my mouth so I could suck him clean.</p> <p>"It's all yours" I thought to myself as we continued our slow fucking, knowing that I would soon be sucking his cock.</p> <p>"You can suck it harder" I thought to myself, knowing that after I let him fuck me, it would probably be my turn to suck some cock. He began pulling out of me. "Please fuck me now" I asked.</p> <p>He did not hesitate. He lay on top of me as I lay on the bed, my arms holding onto the headboard as he began pushing deeper into me. My legs locked around him as he began to pump into me. I felt his balls against mine as he continued to thrust in and out of me. His eyes were closed as he continued stroking his cock deep into me. He was obviously enjoying himself. He stopped moving and lowered his mouth to my pussy to lick andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
