Let's go to bed."</p> <p>I slipped on my bathrobe and we walked hand in hand downstairs. I led him to the couch, he sat down as I got on the floor. I started kissing the base under his earlobes, his neck, his chest, his abdomen, kissing across his navel, between his thighs and finally his penis. I worked my way south then he stopped me. I began again by kissing down his chest, across his abdomen, to his penis. I took the tip of his penis in my mouth and slowly sucked on him.</p> <p>I worked my way south but paused on his stomach. "Do you need a bathrobe?" I said with interest.</p> <p>"I don't have a bathrobe."</p> <p>"Don't you want your penis cleaned?" I said as I continued down his thick bush.</p> <p>"Well yes."</p> <p>I felt a rush of arousal. I loved the sounds of his voice and when he wasn't using his penis, I was sucking on his cock. I found I liked the feel of it and was able to get more of him down my throat as he came.</p> <p>"Did you want to go further?"</p> <p>"I haven't done anything yet."</p> <p>He went around and sat down on the couch. I took his penis in my hand and began stroking him as I spoke to him. "Are you hard yet?"</p> <p>He nodded.</p> <p>"Do you want to cum in my mouth?" I said as I began sucking him with a renewed intensity.</p> <p>"I don't think I can keep this going for long."</p> <p>As I sucked him I kept my eyes locked onto his while I masturbated him with my right hand.</p> <p>"I want to taste you," I said with confidence. I stood up and knelt down in front of him. I took my panties off and began to blow him slowly. I moved up to his face and kissed him deeply as my right hand began stroking him up and down. I stopped kissing, moved away. I was ready to make him cum.</p> <p>"I want you to cum in my mouth now, baby," I said with confidence. We began kissing again. He wanted to taste his semen but would not let me.</p> <p>I moved his chair to the other side of the couch, where there were two other chairs I could use, placed an arm around his neck and began sucking his tongue. I had the taste of him mingled with his precum as I licked him.</p> <p>"Baby, I can't hold back anymore."</p> <p>I smiled and kissed his lips. He didn't pull away.</p> <p>"Can you taste yourself?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes, as long as you get me off."</p> <p>"You're a very good patient."</p> <p>I felt his penis begin to grow as he looked at my breasts. I knew it was going to happen. I kissed him again and began stroking him faster.</p> <p>"Can you make me cum in your mouth?" he asked.</p> <p>I put him in the chair.</p> <p>"No, I want you on the floor. I want to be on top of you. I want you to kiss me and take care of me."</p> <p>I began to move up and down on him as my breasts moved up and down, I was about to reach my peak. I held his penis steady as I moved.</p> <p>"Do you want to cum in my mouth again?" I said.</p> <p>"It's not really that hard."</p> <p>"Why not?"</p> <p>"It's just that it's been a while."</p> <p>"Do you like it?"</p> <p>"I guess."</p> <p>I kissed him as I moved my vagina over his throbbing member. I moved in and out with abandon, in and out, my vagina gripping him, I felt him, I felt his hot semen filling my body. I slowed to a halt, sat down on him, feeling him as he came in me. And stayed there afterwards.</p> <p>We kissed as we recovered. He began to rise up trying to move towards the bathroom.</p> <p>"No," I said, "come in my arms."</p> <p>I felt his stiffness rise inside me.</p> <p>"I have a surprise for both of us," I said as we held each other closely. And I slowly began to rise off of him, moving so I could sit on the edge of the chair.</p> <p>"Okay, honey."</p> <p>I opened the door to the hallway, walked into the bathroom, and let him see me. I watched him as he came. It's strange being someone's first, your first, second, and third boyfriend."</p> <p>The feeling inside me wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
