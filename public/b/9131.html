I giggled. "I guess I'm not going to be able to find a restaurant again... after last time." I thought I just said that because now he knew that I had had the biggest orgasm of my life.</p> <p>"You were a total wreck, did you try anything?"</p> <p>"What?" There was the surprise in my voice.</p> <p>He didn't laugh, and smiled. "You look like you've had a very long day. I can't wait to see how many times you can cum!"</p> <p>I sat in my chair, then slid under the table to give him a big belly kiss as a reward. "Did you cum too,?" I asked.</p> <p>"No, I was too tired...I just...I never wanted to do anything like that before..."</p> <p>He reached into my bra and cupped my boob. "Maybe this next round will be even better, but I've been waiting for you like a virgin...that much I can tell!" I tried to stop him, but he said. "But, there's one thing that I haven't tried like, and I would like to ask you..."</p> <p>"That's fine!" I couldn't take it anymore. "Anything with you makes me very happy!"</p> <p>"I didn't mean to be rude...I just want to do you again, right now, don't you think?" He didn't look all embarrassed, but said, "Maybe just a little... you have so much to learn about what to do with a girl...I'm sure you would like to try, don't you?"</p> <p>"Sure!" I said and leaned toward him as his hands slid over my belly . "Maybe we'll try everything you've said!"</p> <p>He kissed me, and as he did I leaned forward so my lips could meet his. He tasted so good, and I could feel the hardness of his hard cock through our clothes as our lips were locked in passion. When I let my hand slide down his neck, over his chest, and down to his hard cock, there was a lot of precum there that I could feel.</p> <p>"Yes, I was thinking about you all day," I told him as I pulled back.</p> <p>"And now, it would be a shame to waste my hard cock!" he said, and started unbuttoning my blouse.</p> <p>It was a little like when I was in school, unbuttoned the front of my blouse so the buttons came together. He pulled my bra down and I felt his hand slide under the back of my bra to cup my breasts.</p> <p>I let loose a giggle as his fingers lightly tugged my nipple, causing me to let out a cry of pleasure. "Mmmm, that looks good...don't they feel good?"</p> <p>"They feel great!" he said. "Just keep feeling them, I'm still working you over!"</p> <p>One of those soft hands was undoing the last button, then the bra slid down around my hips, revealing my breasts naked, only the cups of my bra covering them. He gave them a soft squeeze through my bra, and then slipped his hand in to the front of my panties, stroking my outer lips, then slipping a finger between the lips, and slipping it in me.</p> <p>Ohmy, he made me cum fast! I had never experienced anything like that! His fingers felt good rubbing my walls, and he had a big smile on his face as he looked up at me as I sat there, watching him, enjoying the moment.</p> <p>But my mind started to go haywire as he pulled out his fingers for a moment, and then reinserted them, sliding them in and out of me as I let out a series of little moans and sighs. He kissed me again, then stood up. "I think I want to see if this booth looks good!"</p> <p>"But, the front door?" I asked.</p> <p>"No, the window's open." He reached into the booth, and his hand pulled me toward the window. He started me and told me to turn around so I would look out the glass of the door.
