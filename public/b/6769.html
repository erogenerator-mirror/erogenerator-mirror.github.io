I took her by the waist and flipped her around so her back was to me; I could feel her wetness against my naked back. Leaning forward, I pushed my middle finger gently into her tight pussy. "Oh, fuck!" she cried. I finger fucked her for what seemed like an eternity, her tightness so tight I thought she'd melt on the spot just from the excitement of my thrusting fingers. With one last thrust, the hand on her head was pulled back for a final embrace. I could see her neck with those eyes shut with ecstasy. I bent down and kissed her, our lips meeting, our tongues entwined.</p> <p>I lifted her back up to her feet and we stood there, kissing tenderly. She brought her hands up to my shoulders and pulled me to her. As soon as my cock broke free from my boxers, her arms slipped around my neck. I was now lying down with my legs on the carpeted top of her bed. I lifted her so her pussy was now hovering right over mine. She broke the kiss first; she looked me in the eye. "I want to make love to you," she said. We kissed again like teenagers at a wild-card football game, and we were both so horny and desperate to have our first time together. She pulled me down to the end of her bed, laying me down on my back. She had a devilish smile on her face.</p> <p>As I was laid out on her bed, she leaned down onto her hands and knees. She looked down at me. She put one knee up on the mattress as she reached for my shaft. She had a mischievous devilish look on her face. "It's been so long," she said as she wrapped her hand around my shaft. It's been so long, she thought, and I've been such a perfect gentleman, especially for a virgin, and her virgin boyfriend.</p> <p>She moved her mouth down the shaft of my hard, rigid cock. I could only look at her as I felt her hot mouth on it. Slowly, she moved further down the shaft, taking more and more of me, and further down her throat. She licked the base of my cock from its base to its tip, teasing, then swirling her tongue around my shaft as she did so. She moved her mouth up and down. Losing herself in the pleasure, she began sucking my cock like a woman possessed, her lips wrapped around it as they did so.</p> <p>I watched her, amazed at how beautiful she was. This was such a revelation that there is a beauty in beauty. Her long brown hair and her blue eyes, just glisten from the lamp light that lit her face. Her long legs up on the bed with legs spread wide, giving me a clear view of her pouting pussy lips. Her breasts were large and full. There was no sag to them. Her pussy was perfectly symmetrical, the full outer lips peaking out of a small, pink clit just a small, pink crevice. I tried to imagine what her ass looked like before she shaved it. It was so small I couldn't tell. It was tiny and delicate, just a small opening for her love canal. She began to breathe, as if she were breathing, but her body language had changed. She was so beautiful, so graceful and so sexy.</p> <p>After a few times of teasing my shaft with her lips, she let it slip out of her mouth. She had a look of determination. Slowly, she moved down the shaft and began sucking the head softly, not allowing much more than the tip of my cock to touch. I knew I wasn't going to last long. I tried to stay focused on her. It was my turn to be disappointed, not wanting to ruin my chances with her. She sensed as well, and continued.</p> <p>"Oh my God!!!", I whimpered. "I don't believe I'm going to last much longer."</p> <p>She smiled, looked up at me, and said, "Then what's the problem?"</p> <p>"I have a lot of time..."</p> <p>"I know; you're a bit young. But I've always wondered what it would be like to take a cock up my ass. I've never done it, but sometimes I read the stories in the magazines, you know, just to help pass the part I love the most about it."</p> <p>"Yes," I said, my mind racing. I knew what she was hoping for. I wanted it so badly that it hurt. There was nothing I wanted more. I pushed her down on the bed and climbed on top of her. Our bodies were pressed together tightly, our bodies feeling each other. Her lips were open and wet as I continued kissing her.</p> <p>I felt her hands come up to my shouldersâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
