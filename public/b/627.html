"Maybe we should head downstairs."</p> <p>"Where is it?" I asked.</p> <p>"Just down the stairs. I'll give you a second," she said, stepping past me. I took a deep breath, knowing that all was forgiven, and hurried down the stairs. I heard her bedroom door close, but not the front door, and only dim light from the hallway. I walked into the hallway, then turned to walk the stairs and my footsteps were still there. I looked to see that the light was still on, and wondered if I could be in here. The steps were short, and I could almost make it up the stairs, just to make sure. I turned back around, to turn on the light, and stopped. I froze a little, then turned back around to the light. I stood a minute to make sure before, and then started walking back through the foyer, towards the living room.</p> <p>They must have heard me walking down the stairs, as the light above them came back up. I turned, and sure enough, there they were! She was lying on her back on a couch in her room, her tank top still on, wearing a pair of white flannel button down shirt and running shorts that I could tell she wasn't wearing underwear. I stood at the entrance to the room for a second, listening to it creak a couple times and she groaned when someone knocked on it. Then it opened, and she looked up at me, looking for something to cover herself, not realizing that I was standing right there.</p> <p>"Hello, neighbor? You're still at home?"</p> <p>"Yep." I walked over and stood next to her. She reached up and gently ran her fingers through mine before placing them on to the side of her shirt. I smiled at her, enjoying the feeling of what I could tell was no bra. "Well, I'm home."</p> <p>"Nice to meet you. Come on in." I stepped aside to let her go in first. I didn't really want to let her go by herself, or she would want me around to do her laundry. She smiled, taking her own big smile, and followed me in. I closed the door behind us, and opened a closet door for what seemed to be fifteen minutes that she didn't get to. I opened the top drawer on the dresser, and was pleased to see so much on the side of the closet that I didn't think could contain underwear again. I knew her clothes would be out in the back, and I hoped to find some of her bras there, too.</p> <p>"Here, take these with you. You can change after you make it back downstairs. I'm just going to leave you in your room," I said, grabbing a couple of more bras to use on her, while I had more time, to make it back downstairs. Then I stood up, and pulled my tee shirt out, leaving all my clothes hanging from the side, hanging from her closet. I started down the stairs, and stopped outside her bedroom door.</p> <p>"Hey, no underwear!" She smiled, standing on the other side of her bed, putting her hands over her face. I grinned at her, turning back to the door. As the door closed, I walked over, slipping my hands into hers, and holding them. Neither of us said anything. I smiled back at her before walking towards her. She turned, looking up at me while holding my hands. I pulled her into mine, kissing her, and she responded. We kissed passionately for some time, until I pulled back and turned her around so that she could continue her little game. I kissed her neck, and kissed her ear, letting her know that I wanted her to touch my cock if I wanted her to touch me again. She looked at me, her breathing still in her throat, and nodded. I stood up again, and bent her over the bed, pulling up her skirt so that she could feel how wet I was getting. I kissed up her inner thigh as I worked my way up, until I reached her pussy. She raised her hips against me, and I slipped a finger inside her, slowly. She moaned at the sensation, and her hands moved back to my arms, pulling me to her. I slid my hand from her cheek down to her pussy, and she took hold of my cock. She rubbed it up and down her slit, before bending over and sucking my hard cock into her mouth. I groaned out into that hungry mouth, and she hummed on my cock.</p> <p>I pushed both her hands away, and knelt behind her, sliding my cock into her wet pussy. She was right. I was able to fill her up, without even a bit of effort, with my first thrust. She moaned even louderâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
