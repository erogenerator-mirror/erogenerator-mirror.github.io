"That's great."</p> <p>"I hope you're not disappointed."</p> <p>"No, I'm a bit disappointed in myself."</p> <p>"I can understand that, it's ok."</p> <p>"Please don't get me wrong," she said. "I know I'm a woman and I'm not really that kind of person."</p> <p>"No really," Brad said. "It's just that my mind's a lot better when I think about doing women."</p> <p>She just stared at him and let him keep the conversation going.</p> <p>"So what do you think?" he asked once again.</p> <p>"Um," she bit her lip, "I like it."</p> <p>"Me too," Brad said. "If I was that desperate I'd never take you back to my parents."</p> <p>"That's because I just don't have the money to live with them."</p> <p>"Really?" he asked, surprised.</p> <p>"Really," she said, looking at him.</p> <p>"I'm just so lonely and you don't seem to be around very often either," he added. "I have to think about things."</p> <p>"Can't believe I'm asking you out again," she said. She wasn't going to say anymore, but she had to.</p> <p>"Just the mention of you is a bit weird. I think that's why I like to go out with girls."</p> <p>"You're not alone."</p> <p>"No, I'm not. But I'm really not sure if I'm ready to take up with someone again. I feel like I'm just a normal young woman who just wants to lose weight."</p> <p>She reached out and placed her hand on his.</p> <p>"You're just like everyone else," she said. "I mean, you're not just going out to get laid every now and then it isn't every night."</p> <p>"I'm not going to lie. I have a hard time getting laid."</p> <p>"I've been going out in a while," he said. "You know that."</p> <p>"I have to admit it is pretty easy for me to be attracted to you. You're not exactly the first woman that I've been attracted to."</p> <p>"I like that."</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"I'm just not used to it," she said. "It's not the same thing as what I'm used to, so I'm afraid I'll always fall into it."</p> <p>"It isn't that," he said. "I mean you're hot to me. I'm not gay or anything. But I like to think it's because I get off on it. That's just how my sex life is."</p> <p>"How do you get off on it?" She asked. "You see the way you dress and how you walk? When you're alone, you're always the one that's around."</p> <p>He smiled and leaned in for a kiss. She pulled back, shocked.</p> <p>"You're so hot," he said. "I mean, you're not that much like any of your exes. So let's just take that for the time being. You're not the type I might think you have it down there at all."</p> <p>"You're not as big as most of the guys I know, Brad. I don't want to have to be the only one naked. Let's just say I've had plenty of experience with sexier girls."</p> <p>"So does that mean that there'll be others along the way?"</p> <p>"I hope so." There was a long pause before she reached out and took his hand. "I guess this won't be so bad?"</p> <p>"It isn't so bad. It might even be fun," he said.</p> <p>"That's what I was thinking too, but it's just not the right time if you're not into it. That's the whole situation, and there'll be no holding back if the relationship ends up in a messy divorce where we end up with some broken relationship that has other people's feelings."</p> <p>After a very brief pause, the couple broke up. She went back to her apartment with Brad. Their relationship was still awkward to say the least, but she felt secure when she was around him.</p> <p>Brad didn't know exactly what was going on with him and his relationship with Jenny, but he felt comfortable enough with her to ask a question that wasn't going to affect their relationship in the least.</p> <p>"So what's going on with you and Jenny?" he asked as he picked up the phone.</p> <p>"Is there trouble?" Brad asked. "We've only been dating for about 6 months."</p> <p>"Uh, yeah," she smiled at him. "That's not what I meant, but it's not the worst part of our relationship. It's always goodâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
