"Oh, honey, I think I'm gonna cum. Do you want me to stop?"</p> <p>"No, no," I panted. "Just keep going."</p> <p>Her hand worked my cock faster; she had one hand around the base as her lips and tongue massaged and stimulated me all over. Finally, finally, I shot my wad. I grabbed Heather by the wrist with my free hand and pulled her mouth off my dick. I turned my hand so that my fingers could lightly tease her clit. Heather kept still as my fingers danced on her sensitive nub.</p> <p>A smile played across my lips. She was going to keep my dick warm this week. I could live with that.</p> <p>"Oh, Heather," I sighed, "it feels so good."</p> <p>I could tell by her face that she was still a bit breathless. She was grinning broadly as my fingers slipped between her lips and started caressing her clit again. It didn't take much for Heather to come again.</p> <p>"That was really good, honey," she moaned. "So good."</p> <p>"That was nice," I said. "But there's not quite enough moisture in there."</p> <p>I pulled her head back and kissed her. It had been quite sometime since I'd been with anyone. I took a chance and slid off of the bed and headed for the bathroom.</p> <p>"I wish you'd let me do that," I joked, "you know, with your cum in my mouth."</p> <p>"Just use the shower," Heather agreed. She slid off of her bed, gathered her nightgown from the floor, and started walking to the bathroom. "I'll be back."</p> <p>I watched her sexy ass as she left the bedroom, and couldn't help but think about what I had done with her earlier. I would have given anything to go back to my hotel room and watch a beautiful, naked and sexy lady walking topless down the hallway to a shower where she could be with her favorite boy toy.</p> <p>It's hard to picture a relationship from that point, but I do know what I'd love to do with Heather as we do for each other. And if two sexy bodies are involved, I'd definitely have to think about that oneâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
