He was tall, tall and muscular with deep brown eyes. He looked younger than his age, or at least that's what I told myself a few minutes later when I got out of the shower.</p> <p>I had been looking forward to seeing him after a long day. He was a tall man, probably in his late thirties, and I was trying not to take my eyes off his body. He had a slim athletic build. His hair was short and unkempt—I couldn't believe how handsome he looked. Not just yet, I decided. I had yet to see the man. There was one thing I couldn't tell myself though. His body was really quite, it was more than a little hard to believe but it was the way he had leaned forward and his hands and hands were gently stroking my hair.</p> <p>"Is it too much?" I asked.</p> <p>"No, it's been a long day. You're the first person I've met to leave me hanging in that little shower," he said. His words were a little melodic, even though I had heard them on his voice before. I had to agree.</p> <p>"Good, then I'll take care of you," I said, giving in and pulling him down for a kiss.</p> <p>"Well, you have been an amazing teacher! I've got to thank you from the bottom of my heart!" he told me, laughing as he pulled himself inside my warm body, pushing to me even more.</p> <p>"If you must know, I'm a little sore right now, so do you mind giving me a massage?" I answered him, hoping I could keep this from ending too soon.</p> <p>"I'd love too," he told me. "It's my job to teach students how to relax and take their first steps. And I don't know anyone in New Hampshire who needs a massage from a man who's already got me so hot!"</p> <p>"I do have to agree, I'm a little sore right now but I'm not mad. I really do appreciate it. I hope you'll stay here long enough to help out around the house, though. You can be sure to give me a call before you leave whenever you're in need of help." I told him hoping he would take my advice. I had no idea how it was that he had such a wonderful sense of humor.</p> <p>"I am working from home today, so I'll be back in a few. Thanks for offering to make dinner for me." Was all he said.</p> <p>"It's no imposition; it's just a little something that I can't think of right now, that's all," I said as I smiled at him. "The only thing you're going to be doing tonight is staying over at the house so I can hang on and get you a massage," I added with a wink. "It's not my first massage here, either." I leaned my head into him and kissed him deeply, allowing him to grab my hips.</p> <p>"My pleasure, Miss Jones." He kissed me again and I felt his hands wandering from my hips to my ass. "It's okay, I don't mind," he said with a wink before pulling his hand back. It was a warm and loving place for him to touch me and I knew without a doubt that I was going to be very comfortable with him.</p> <p>"Are you sure you don't mind?" I asked him teasingly, although I didn't wait the full three seconds to tell him that I meant every word.</p> <p>"Hell no, Miss Jones, I don't mind. I love being with you," he told me. His smile was bright when he said that so I couldn't have said anything right then either. Maybe it wasn't the place for him to say anything, but to me it felt like he was saying, "I can't wait to see what happened tonight!"</p> <p>"All right," I whispered to him and we kissed again. It wasn't just the hot sex, the touch, the kisses, and whatever else that this beautiful man could give me. It was pure pleasure. I'm sure the first thing he heard when he returned was, "You'd better hurry up now!"</p> <p>"I said I'd be waiting," I whispered as he pulled back and was gone into the house. He called later that night a week later and we had gone out to celebrate his birthday and I couldn't stop thinking about the way he had looked at me. I couldn't help it. And there was no denying how sexy I look tonight. I could feel the heat from my skin against his and I felt so sexy. The only thing he hadn't seen before was me in front of him and that night was when he had touched me so gently. I knew then and there that there was no turning back. I just wanted to be with him.</p> <p>To be continued. <|endoftext—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
