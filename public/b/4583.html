"I've been waiting for this," I told him.</p> <p>"Well, we'll see," he replied, and took hold of my hand. He pulled me closer to him, and I could feel his hardness pressing against me. I opened my mouth to speak, but was quickly silenced by his mouth on mine, taking me deeply. I moaned as his lips closed over mine. It was a new experience for me, and I found myself responding enthusiastically. His tongue played with mine, exploring the inside of my mouth, and he tasted of me. It was a pleasant, exciting feeling. My hands were wrapped around his waist, and I found his arms were still at rest on the arms of the couch, so I placed my hands on my legs. I loved the feeling of his fingers running along my slit, and it aroused me, as I could feel the excitement building in my body.</p> <p>When they suddenly wrapped around my shoulders and pulled me back, I felt David's fingers begin to move down to my tits. His hands pulled and twisted my nipples roughly, causing my body to arch forward. He pushed my shirt up over my breasts, exposing my bare belly to his lustful gaze. "Look at those tits..."</p> <p>I couldn't believe what I was saying. I moaned softly as his eyes drank me into as my breasts swayed on my chest in a hypnotic fashion, his fingers playing with the hard nubs.</p> <p>"Do you like my hands on your tits?" he said hoarsely, his lips still pressing against mine.</p> <p>"Mmm!" I replied as I closed my eyes, enjoying the feelings coursing through me.</p> <p>"Then don't stop." He said, as his hands began to travel down my stomach.</p> <p>"Do you like my mouth on your tits?" he repeated.</p> <p>"Mmm, yes..." I answered between moans, his expert fingers slipping into my cleavage. He pushed a knuckle against the top of my bra, and I felt the softness of the lace. David's hands moved back down to my pussy, pressing his fingers against my swollen lips, and he began to work them into my moistening hole. The combination of our pleasure was having its desired effect on me, and I felt the familiar throb of my erection as he slipped his hand beneath my skirt and began to stroke my pussy lips. I spread my legs to give him better access, and I moaned softly as his fingers slipped inside the silk of my skirt, massaging my pussy over my lace panties. My arousal was rising. I was desperate for more, and he was responding to my desire. I reached for him. "Do you want me to stop?" he asked.</p> <p>My voice was hoarse, and when I heard the desperation in my own voice, it was all I needed for a response.</p> <p>"No, don't stop....please..." I moaned into his mouth.</p> <p>He pushed a second finger inside me. "Shh, there! I love the feeling of you wanting me....do you want me to fuck you?" he whispered.</p> <p>His fingers were moving faster now, and I knew that I was close to another climax. "Yes...oh god..." I gasped, my body tensing as it approached. "Don't stop. Please, I want you to fuck me." I moaned, my climax approaching. "Fuck me, dammit!" I cried.</p> <p>He thrust a third finger in me, and my body exploded as he drove in a fourth finger, causing me to feel as if I might cum again. "Oh yes, you're so wet! You've been watching me fuck you, haven't you?" He asked.</p> <p>I nodded, desperately trying to catch my breath, not wanting to speak just then. "Mmm!"</p> <p>"What did I just say?" he asked, as he reached down his body and started to slide his fingers in and out of me. I opened my eyes, to see him staring at my naked body, his fingers stroking his hard cock. I moaned as his pace quickened.</p> <p>"You said I could fuck you!" I exclaimed.</p> <p>"But it looks like I want you to fuck me again." He murmured. "Oh, don't worry, you won't regret it." He assured me.</p> <p>I nodded. "Yes, I'll never regret it."</p> <p>He moved up to me, and I felt the bulge in his pants. He moved his other hand around my body, and began to rub my clit. I groaned as he started to rub it over the thin material, and I gasped when he slid his finger inside me. I arched my back and pushed myself back onto his hand. "Oh god," I whispered, and David's mouth descended on mine again.
