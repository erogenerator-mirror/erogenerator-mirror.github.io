The weather had not changed very much and I didn't have too much time because I had to finish some work myself. I was almost finished when I saw some people staring at me from the side table at the table. Just as I was about to say something they started talking about me and I blushed as my skirt crept up my leg. This only seemed to amuse them a little.</p> <p>"I was wondering if you would like to join us in our little gathering. There is a pool that I have there and that will help keep you occupied while we get to know each other better."</p> <p>I still had my skirt on but I didn't have any heels so I stepped over to the pool and looked around. The only thing that made me feel better was that someone had obviously been watching all the time. It might also have been that some of the women were staring at me.</p> <p>I don't know how or when exactly they started talking to each other again but I wasn't having much trouble listening. I was thinking how lucky I was to have such a perfect body. I just got the feeling that I was walking on air as my legs were now almost wrapped around some of the pool's surface. I was thinking this was the one guy that would do anything for me. I couldn't decide whether to stare and stare.</p> <p>Just then the sound of the doorbell rang and it was then that I knew this must be some kind of weird club meeting.</p> <p>"That's great!" I thought.</p> <p>I just kept my eyes locked on the door, trying to figure out whether the stranger would come through the door or not. My hands were clasped behind my back so I couldn't take my eyes off the door. Then the doorbell rang and I knew it must be the guy that had come through. At this point all my senses were focused on me and my breasts and my panties were getting wetter and wetter. I just started to wonder if I was going to let myself go. I knew a lot of the other women in the club but I could never quite keep everyone happy. It was only with this club that I saw that all of the girls and some of the guys could get a little carried away. The group of men that were in some part of the room would often go up to the ladies area and sit on the couches that were against the wall and watch people dance on the floor. Sometimes they would give the guy at the other spot a good time.</p> <p>By now I was sweating profusely at the thought that this stranger would be able to get even with me, especially in public. I could feel the juices of my pussy on the crotch of my panties and the thought of being able to get a stranger into bed had the same effect. The thought made my nipples stand straight out. I tried to take in some of the music that was playing and it was really kind of fun to dance and have the whole room watch. It was really turning me on and it made me excited. The man at the door was really looking at me. He must have heard me groan when I opened the door to the club.</p> <p>"That is all part of our little club. We need to be the center of attention and the way we play it here tonight is to give out free drinks to women who get into the game of strip poker. That is all. If anyone starts winning you could just say that we have a little party here and you want to come to it again whenever you are ready."</p> <p>He had that little grin that people seem to have when they see a woman they are interested in winning. He would take you at your word and when he knew you was up to his challenge. His eyes told me all of the time.</p> <p>"You were wondering if there is a pool on our floor?" He asked.</p> <p>"Oh, yes. When I come to this club, I would love to be the center of attention by the winners. What would you say if the game was all the winners get a round of applause?"</p> <p>"You mean I get the opportunity to win a round by myself?"</p> <p>"Yes, of course. If you want, you may even get to watch the game once a month."</p> <p>"But not a lot of people can watch it" I said</p> <p>"True."</p> <p>There was a big smile on his face. He then pointed his finger and said, "Here is the deal. If you win, you need to do a little strip tease for the guys in the room while I walk around the room. After that your time alone is up to you."</p> <p>"What do I tell them?" I asked</p> <p>"You want to watch the men in the room and you can have the guys watch you or you can doâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
