She was in front of him, he noticed.</p> <p>"This is a nice dress, too," she said. She reached over and held his hand as she squeezed it. "That will be fine."</p> <p>"Let's get some food down here," he said. "You can look at it as your lunch."</p> <p>"Thank you," she smiled. "So you like me, do you?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes," he laughed. "I like you."</p> <p>They ate their salads in silence.</p> <p>"So," he said abruptly, after a while. "Was your first experience in that field with some students?"</p> <p>"Yes," she smiled.</p> <p>"Well, I don't see how you could do without it. Not after what your father gave you."</p> <p>"I did too," Jennifer explained. "He gave me what I now know as a lot of money.
