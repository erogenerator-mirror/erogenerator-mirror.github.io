She reached up and massaged her roommate's shoulders.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Dennis and Emma had become fast friends during college. Since graduation they had even started seeing their mutual neighbor, David. Dennis was about 6'2" and weighed two hundred and fifty pounds. His sandy blonde hair was tied back in a ponytail at the back of his head, which was a beautiful color. Emma, her best friend and her long suffering student, was about 130 pounds and weighed about eighty-five. She was also a knockout. While many girls were very proud and proud of her figure, Emma also had a very tight athletic body and long, straight blond hair. They had both been a couple for about seven years before they broke up.</p> <p>After their sophomore year, both girls had decided to go to a university that had only one school system. Both girls were intelligent, bright, and capable of talking directly to their teacher. On occasion they were asked to discuss their plans for college and when the teachers asked them out, they both said yes. It had been the first time that both girls could be friends since they had finished sophomore year. They had also started going to parties together during that school year.</p> <p>Dennis started out talking with Emma during his junior and senior year in high school. He was also in the same class from her junior.</p> <p>"So, Emma, you're into girls." He asked.</p> <p>She stared down at him and said, "Well," she said with a quick smile on her face, "I guess so." Dennis looked at her with a stunned expression. "So, Dennis," she said, "Do you get a chance at getting even with us tonight at the Frigidated Lounge?"</p> <p>He shook his head and told her, "Well, it's none of my business, but, well," he said with a smile, "I'll see you, I guess."</p> <p>Amy grinned and said, "Don't worry, Emma. At least tell me where to find a room."</p> <p>"I'll let you know how I like to get a room," Emma said and stepped away, leaving her friend behind.</p> <p>Dennis turned to Emma and took her in his arms. He gave her a passionate kiss and then dropped a hand down to her pussy. His fingers worked quickly over her slit and she was soon moaning at the touch of his fingers on her pussy. He moved his hand up to her chest and played with her tits for several moments.</p> <p>She pushed up into his firm touch and he leaned down and lightly flicked her nipple with the tip of his tongue. His hand continued to tease her pussy and she was feeling very hot.</p> <p>She pulled away from him and walked off the couch toward the door. He followed her without saying anything. She opened the door and he walked the two doors to their dorm room. When he entered the room he stopped, turning. She was standing in front of a mirror, stark naked.</p> <p>"Do you like?" she asked, "I wore a pink, long robe for you." She slowly pulled the robe off and let it fall to the floor. "I had been working on your shower and I needed help, you know."</p> <p>He looked at her naked body, noticing the long, slender legs that encased a tight, toned body. He was amazed at the size of her tits. "You're gorgeous," he said. She dropped her robe to the floor next to the bed.</p> <p>He got on the bed on his knees, and pushed her back, kissing her neck and then her lips with his. He could feel her hands gently pressing on the small of his back as she pulled him close. He reached down to her pussy and her hand flew to his penis. She guided it into her waiting cunt. It slid into her without any difficulty in the tight, warm grip of her body.</p> <p>Dennis kissed her passionately as he started sliding in and out of her body. He knew from her previous experience with him that Emma was not all that experienced and he didn't want to hurt her. She moaned as she held the back of his head with her hands. His hips moved in a long, slow rhythm, forcing her body into him.</p> <p>He reached forward and pulled the nipple of her right tit, pulling on it while his left hand kneaded her other tit. He continued to slide in and out as if they were a pair of two-dollar machines. He was building the pleasure in her very slowly and as his orgasm was building, it was more than he could bear.</p> <p>"Oh, Emma," he moanedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
