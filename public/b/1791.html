Our minds raced at the possibility that it was him. I wanted to reach down, hold it in my hand, listen to his voice, and just keep going. I was about to get up when I saw him reach into the desk's pocket for his wallet. Then he said, "I thought I heard it in the other room." He looked me with a kind of devious grin.</p> <p>"Oh." I was confused. I knew who was calling me. I knew what time it was, and I could see his face in the corner of my eye. A part of me, which had felt like someone else, was getting turned on and a desire to just fuck his brains out. But there was no time. He must have seen me looking at the door when he picked up the phone, because he stood up and waved. I stood up and followed him to the entrance. He turned back and said, "I told you I was going out with my boss." I looked at him confused for a minute, and then said, "Oh, I see." He nodded and then I said, "I just wanted to say good morning." We shook hands and he turned away to go and I walked with him.</p> <p>I looked down at my feet as we strolled along and was about to do something about it, and then stopped myself, as I knew how much I didn't like it.</p> <p>"It's nice to meet you, David." I turned to face him and said, "Well, you go with me." and smiled. It was a weird look, one I couldn't quite place. David smiled back and replied with, "Yeah, that sounds like you've done it before in your time." I felt better, and I thanked him for the invite. He was always so helpful when the door was open. But it was still cold outside and maybe he had plans for tonight. In the kitchen, he was making us drinks and making comments. I thought he would make it a bit more personal than what it was really. This meant I had been waiting a long time for this date to happen, to become a better lover.</p> <p>"It feels nice to have you come home with me." His voice had become deeper and the look on his face was different. It was a look of lust, a look that said, "Yeah, I haven't had good time yet."</p> <p>"Yeah, it's really nice to get to know someone again."</p> <p>He sipped his drink and looked around the kitchen. "Do you think you're up for a nightcap in one?"</p> <p>"Yes, maybe, but not tonight."</p> <p>"Okay. I'm sure you'll get by that." He turned, pulled out a chair and motioned me to sit down on the edge of the table. I did, and he took a long sip of his whiskey. A little ice cubes tinkled with that sound of an alcohol-free champagne glass being pulled from the depths of the cup and pushed back to the back of my throat. I could not believe how strong it felt, and how sweet it was. I had never tasted anything like it, or in fact, any drink that had any consistency at all other than my hand, mouth and nose. The alcohol was more an experience, in the dark. In that position, I could not get over how sexy I had gotten for this man, and even after a while, I was becoming attracted to him even more. I didn't know if what I had learned was true or just wishful thinking on my part.</p> <p>He continued a sip of his whiskey, "Let's go, lover." He had been drinking quite a bit since last we met. I felt myself flush with excitement, and felt myself get aroused.</p> <p>Without saying a word, we went to his bedroom, and in it, he took me in his arms and we kissed for all we were worth. Then he lay me down on the bed, and I could not help myself and reach out between us to stroke his hard body, which felt so different than before, which felt so very different. Finally, David rolled on top of me and then went down the bed with me, his tongue licking and sucking on my lips, causing an instant reaction. My tongue sought his like a starving animal might seek the nourishment of its prey. He licked my lips and then slowly slid his tongue into my mouth, slowly working it past with the same expertise as I had worked my tongue into his.</p> <p>I had learned to like that when his tongue slid along the outline of my lips and into my mouth. I felt his hardness pressing against me and I knew it was coming when he softly caressed my cheek, and then slipped one hand around to my chest, cupping my left breast, squeezing it in his hand, and then movingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
