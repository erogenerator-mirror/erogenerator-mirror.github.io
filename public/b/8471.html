You're right! And please, please! Put that thing back in...right now. Please don't make me..." His lips broke off as he thought of the perfect man who would be his tonight.</p> <p>"Please...Mr. Martin? Can I...?"</p> <p>"I'm sorry, Miss..."</p> <p>"Oh, god! Please, please...?"</p> <p>"Mr....?" He felt like his heart was about to burst...</p> <p>"...please, please, please." Mr. Martin could hardly believe what his dream seemed like.</p> <p>"I'm not going to let you fuck me, you stupid fucking boy." Mr. Martin's voice broke him away from himself. "I just want to know that you are real. You deserve better, you just know." Mr. Martin looked at his reflection in the mirror. He saw himself. He saw the real Mr Martin. What was Mr. Martin doing? He turned over and began to cry. "Get out you bastard!" Mr. Martin turned her body to him. "Get out of my house. We'll figure out how to get out of this. You don't have any idea what I'm going to do with you, do you? Get over here. I want this job."</p> <p>As Mr. Martin turned towards the door he couldn't understand what he heard. She...she? He saw her face turn white and a huge smile spread across her face. "Get over here now, damn you, you crazy boy!" She turned around. She didn't look pleased. "Get over here now, I have to start getting stuff ready for dinner..." She said it so slowly he knew why. Finally, he found his voice. "I have to go. I'll see you later." She walked off the phone and turned back to Mr. Martin. He was completely enraged by her. They walked towards the front door of her house. They walked inside. Mr. Martin saw what happened to his apartment was that of his ex-girlfriend. He went and got a key, told her he had to leave and he went to leave.</p> <p>"You can't, you're my student!" Mr. Martin went back into his empty student's room without saying a word. He found that girl sleeping by the window. She was looking at a picture of Mr. Martin. "Can a girl let him have a look?"</p> <p>"I'll take it back, please don't leave me."</p> <p>"You should go. He's the best at...taking care of himself." Mr. Martin went to a kitchen door and saw a girl, naked except for a pair of shoes under a hat. "Can she stay?"</p> <p>"Don't you..." She looked around, then turned around again. "I'm sorry, Mr. ..." She was crying again.</p> <p>"Get off of her! Don't she understand what she did?" Mr. Martin yelled. "She's supposed to go to school, now!"</p> <p>They both ran out into the street towards the street. "Mr. Martin!" He stopped and was about to turn her over to leave.</p> <p>"Mr....?"</p> <p>"Please, Mr. Martin. Leave me alone. It was a mistake, now leave and never speak again." She was looking at him. "Please, please, Mr. Martin, can a girl come stay with you?"</p> <p>"No, please leave..." She begged. "I can't... I'll just go..." She looked for the hat again. "Please just, please leave."</p> <p>"Please...come to school, please." She begged but got no answer, so she got undressed.</p> <p>"Please...come to my apartment, Please..." She had this crazy look in her eye. Suddenly, she grabbed what she kept hidden away in her room and threw it down at Mr. Martin.</p> <p>"No!" Mr. Martin yelled. "Please don't...please don't..." She grabbed it and threw it at his face. He started to get up and she ran over by him and wrapped her arms around him. "You're not going anywhere, Mr. Martin! I'll call your mommy!" She said it like a taunt and was getting into it. She kept rubbing her finger on his lips and kissed him passionately. He had a look of fear in his eyes and looked scared. "No," she whispered. "Please don't..." She kept kissing him until he calmed down and kissed her back even harder. "You made me feel so strange you pervert..." She finally broke her hold on him and left the room.</p> <p>Mr. Martin went home and went to his apartment to start working on his day. When he walked in, he noticed his girlfriend was naked. Well except one piece of clothing, he thought.</p> <p>Lucky meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
