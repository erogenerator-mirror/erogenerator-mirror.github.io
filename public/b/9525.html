"Come over to the desk," I commanded. He walked over to the desk, looking at the papers again. He bent over and picked them up, looking them over in his head, not saying a word. I knew he couldn't be very happy about it, and I was.</p> <p>"You will do exactly what I tell you. Do you understand?" I continued looking at him. With a big grin, and no expression. He smiled a bit again, but hesitated. "Do you understand?" I queried again. This time, he nodded his head as he looked back at the top of the shelf. I had him get completely down on his knees, with a firm grip on both shoulders. I felt him pull on his hair with some urgency as he looked up at me.</p> <p>Looking back down from his seated position, looking at the top of the shelf, he spoke. "Yes, sir." Without a pause.</p> <p>I waited for the next words. "Good. Now take off your boots." He looked me up and down, slowly, but steadily. I had him start over. "Very good. Now, I want you to stand up. We can talk a bit more, if you like."</p> <p>He obeyed as I pulled him by the hands up the aisle to the next shelf. As we looked at what I was doing, he took a step forward. I looked at him, as he stepped over the boxes that stood there. When he stood facing me again, my hands were still on his shoulders. It was obvious that he was nervous, but he didn't try to move back. I was pleased with my own ability to take what he commanded.</p> <p>Reaching from behind, I pulled on his shirt, letting my fingers rake down his chest and belly. My fingers trailed down to his belt loops. I tugged them out and back up to where I could pull out his cock, still hard. I took the head of his cock in my hand. It wasn't as large as the boys of my school, it wasn't as thick. I had to be careful, so that if he jerks a bit and moves away, I wouldn't cause him to lose control. I started with the head of his cock, looking at him.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" His voice was husky, and a little breathless. I smiled as I slowly ran my fingers up and down the length of his shaft. His hips started to move and move, and his hands were balling into fists.</p> <p>"Yes. I'm sure." I gave him his answer on his cock by stroking him slowly and gently. "Good boy," I said as the veins in his cock stood out in response to the touch of my fingers, but before I went any further, he'd get nervous, and I'd want to see him try to control it. I looked up at him the first time, and saw he was looking back at me intently. I wanted to get off the desk, but I wasn't ready to stop yet. I was still enjoying myself, though! Pulling back his foreskin, his cockhead was exposed. As if a little part of me was getting off on him having been denied his excitement. Now, however, I had a choice of either to continue touching him, or to pull the foreskin and release the blood, or to make him suffer for me. I'd have to think of something else, a really good choice!</p> <p>"I want you to lie on the table, on your back, face up, with your arms and legs spread wide." He didn't move. I looked him right in the eye, looked up toward him to be sure he understood what had just happened. "When I return from my run, you'll understand."</p> <p>I picked up the phone. "Call the number on that list. The number will tell you why I took the time to call you on the phone earlier." He turned over and nodded at me as I hung up. As I stood up, I reached down and pulled my skirt up my legs, letting it fall onto the floor. "Put your feet together," I directed as I turned back to the desk. "And spread your legs. If the number on the front begins to come back up, I want you completely spread. That is if you want me to call you in."</p> <p>"Yes sir," he said. Once again, he didn't move!</p> <p>I walked around the desk and bent down to my knees. Reaching down, I pushed down with my hands and took his cock in, holding on and pushing him back up as I moved his head up and down. His head hung in front, down toward the floor. I reached inside the front of my shirt and foundâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
