She did NOT know how much longer she would continue to fight it. Tears came to her eyes.</p> <p>"It is time that you make the first of five decisions," said Sam, "go back to your seat and stand next to your father."</p> <p>As the flight attendants started cleaning their hands on the controls, Sarah raised her hands again and again began to chant "Father?" before the first plane had landed.</p> <p>"Mother!"</p> <p>The first of the flight attendants, dressed in a loose, long-sleeved shirt and cut off jeans, with her bra covering half her breasts, turned their attention away and looked directly at Sarah. The women stood there for more than fifteen seconds before starting to make eye contact. Sam watched closely as Sam stepped beside Sarah. Sarah's hands were still moving, she was sure, through her hair, her face was alive.</p> <p>The woman with the deep brown eyes that she had seen in the past came up to Sarah's father and shook his hand. She looked at Sarah and smiled. "I'm Sam by the way," she said, extending her hand, "I'm Tina. It's nice to meet you," she paused, and the women could hear the laughter that she had been holding.</p> <p>"I'm glad you're home, dear," said Sam, "and I'm glad you're joining us for supper tonight."</p> <p>As Sam turned to walk away, Sarah looked around the airplane, trying to make sense of everything. She looked down at her mother, and saw the smile on her face, a smile that was not lost on Sarah, and then saw it on the faces of the two men from earlier. Sam walked away and left.</p> <p>She closed her eyes and prayed in her mind, praying for the day that she could keep that smile.</p> <p>*</p> <p>When Sarah got home, she found that her mother's favorite dress was a bit of a mess. She knew that she didn't get it much of any real pleasure, like getting a good spanking before she was a child. There was nothing to do but go home and wash it off.</p> <p>Her mother was in the kitchen fixing dinner, talking to the chef, watching the man and woman they were looking at. Sarah looked over at the kitchen to make sure he was watching.</p> <p>"Where is everybody?" she asked, "Is anyone having a good time?"</p> <p>"You should be," said Maria. She looked back to Sarah, "Your mother is the center of one of those, you see. I'm the center of what everyone calls the "Dinner and Dance". This is where all the families come together to share whatever they like. We are a kind of a family." She looked in her mom's favor. "We love the children coming home from school, and we love working with them, so no kids from your sister."</p> <p>"That sounds great," said Sarah. "That is why I was hoping you and I would join us for a bit."</p> <p>A few minutes later as they were in the dining room making some leftovers for dinner, Sarah asked her mother, "Why am I in there again? I've decided to go to bed."</p> <p>"Oh, dear," she said, "that is not something I would want to do. You can tell me, of course."</p> <p>Sarah pulled out her chair and sat down, crossing her legs. As she was seated, she looked at her husband. His eyes were fixated on her legs. He smiled at her. "I see that you enjoyed your meal, did you? I think that you might be ready for a new hobby." He moved closer to Sarah and placed his hands on her hands. Sarah felt his touch of his hands, soft but firm.</p> <p>Sarah's heart was beating very quickly, she felt like she could burst. She moved her hands toward his, as was her mind. She could have, though, chosen to go a bit farther for the moment. She felt his hands against her neck as he leaned forward and she felt his lips on her cheek. He kissed her ear, she could feel his hard cock pressing against her.</p> <p>Her hand had reached out to her daughter's leg. She had touched her daughter's thigh, just a little as part of the foreplay, and felt the warmth of desire for her touch. The feelings that she had felt in the past made her feel excited. She could do something else - that she would do to her daughter. She just had not done it.</p> <p>She pulled her face back. "Mommy," she said.</p> <p>"Sarah?" It was just now that she realized what she had said. "I'm not sure where this might lead."</p> <p>"Well, let's see," she smiled.
