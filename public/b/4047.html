He pulled me down on him and we lay there for a minute feeling each other. I kissed his neck and ears but then moved down and kissed his nipples. He sighed and pulled me back up.</p> <p>"Are you okay with this?" he asked.</p> <p>"Of course," I lied. I didn't actually like it. It felt weird and disgusting. "Do I have to say this a second?"</p> <p>"Yes," he said. His erection was starting to come out. It had been getting bigger in his shorts.</p> <p>"Maybe that's the moment to say that you like it," I said and went back to my original position. My face and chest came together.</p> <p>"So, what happens now?"</p> <p>"I'm going to let you in on my little secret," I said as I slowly started to move my hips up and down. He grabbed my hips and pulled me down onto his lap. For the first time that day, I felt his cock against my clit. I pushed my hips into him and he responded as I felt his cock twitch against my clit.</p> <p>He started to move his hips up and down rubbing against me. He grabbed my breasts and started to tease and tug on my nipples. I felt waves of pleasure spread through me. The pleasure was a new kind of pleasure and I could tell it was becoming more intense. I pushed into his cock as he pulled me on top of him, feeling it press into me. His cock was bigger than Josh's but not that much bigger. He seemed to feel like Josh.</p> <p>I had stopped moving to let him move a little but continued to move my hips. He slid into me. I had never felt this turned on before. This wasn't my first time. Josh was a lot of fun and Josh made me feel incredible.</p> <p>I felt the tip of his cock touch the lips of my pussy. "Josh, please" I begged. Josh grabbed my hips and pulled me down onto him. His cock entered the opening of my pussy as a thick and heavy part of his cock. He slid it all the way inside me. He pushed his finger against my clit and started rubbing at him. I began to move again.</p> <p>"Mmm-hmm-hmmmm," I moaned. I could never tell when his cock would move and when it would not move. I found I liked it that way too and found that my pussy had been stretched and filled so tight that he could thrust in another way. His cock was filling me more than Josh's fingers had. He could thrust his cock into me a lot further each time. He continued to pump in and out, building my excitement in return.</p> <p>"You feel so good, Josh," I moaned. Josh smiled and continued to rub my clit with his thumb. I could feel my climax building. Josh rubbed my clit and then put two fingers into my pussy. He moved his fingers in and out as he thrust his cock. I pushed myself up each time and he held my hips steady as I approached my climax. It didn't seem so intense. This time I felt better than last time.</p> <p>"Yes," I said panting.</p> <p>"I thought so," he said sounding a little smug. He started to fuck just a bit harder and held my hips still. I started to shake and he thrust his cock even more into me.</p> <p>"Uhnnnnnnn," I moaned.</p> <p>"Oh fuck!" he exclaimed as I started to feel an orgasm rising.</p> <p>I couldn't take it anymore. I felt his cock pulse inside me and then begin to throb. He jerked a little but didn't stop. His cock was still hard inside me. He kissed my chest as he stopped thrusting. He pulled my hips hard against his, kissing my nipples as he continued to gently move his hips up and down. I was coming and his cock felt so good inside me.</p> <p>"Josh, we are almost finished," I said into his ear as I felt his lips and tongue running against me.</p> <p>"I guess we are," he said smiling while still inside of me.</p> <p>"Josh please finish and let me finish," I moaned.</p> <p>He didn't even move. I felt nothing but his hardness inside my pussy. His fingers were still playing with my clit and I held onto him. When he started moving in and out of me, I came again.</p> <p>Josh stopped when I was done shaking and he started thrusting. His cock felt much more sensitive now too. I could feel his precum leaking slowly out. I had never been on my back with another man fucking me. I felt like Josh was going to fuck me againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
