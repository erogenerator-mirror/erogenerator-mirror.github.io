A little to the left of me, just an inch or two, a little longer than my arm and a little more than 3 inches. The only thing I had on my mind right now was for her to turn her head away, knowing she couldn't see me, because at exactly that angle, my cock was at the perfect angle. I would have loved to push it up to her mouth, to force its head in, but just when it was about to burst, I held back. Then I wanted to feel her lips against mine, taste her. And then I wanted to feel her tongue dancing on my cock, her tongue sliding along the underside as it slid down past the base of my shaft.</p> <p>We both had been anticipating our next adventure. I felt the bed tilt a little as we moved back toward it. I was sure she was going to move, so I moved to the edge of the bed to give her room. She turned so I could reach her, so I could kneel as she had moved to be next to me. She was kneeling on the right side of the bed. I had a clear view of her face, from the right angle. Her eyes were closed, so I could see into her mouth as she started to suck me.</p> <p>A smile crossed my lips as I felt her tongue against the underside of my shaft. It was a soft, slow lap, like a cat's lap; it made me tingly all over. Her arms were wrapped around me from her head to her hand, so she was kneading the whole surface of my cock.</p> <p>I leaned to her ear to whisper, "I want you. Right now. Right here. Right now. In fact, I love this very much! I need to taste you!"</p> <p>When she could not speak, she simply nodded and moved her body away, laying on her back as I climbed on top of her. I pulled the sheets back, exposing her face as I placed the head of my cock at the outer lips of her pussy. Her mouth opened to me and I sank in, slowly. Her mouth was closed tight, trying to keep me from coming out. She whimpered and tried to move away, but I grabbed her and pulled her back against me, my cock moving deep into her body. "Ssssshhhhh... I love it... I love fucking you!" I growled, moving my hips slightly backwards to rub her clit as I held on to her hips. When I thrust back, I found her mouth again, and when I felt her tongue against my lips, it was her turn to moan. I kissed her and pulled back, making her suck me in as I made one last thrust, deep into her body.</p> <p>We both moaned as I left her body and turned to face the bed. "Come here," she said after I settled down. "Lay down beside me." I complied. She curled herself up on the bed and I moved my head up to kiss her. Our lips were warm, and we made out for a long time.</p> <p>I reached down and stroked her face for a moment, enjoying the feeling, the sight, and the feel of her body against mine. I pulled away, letting her face get up, and I whispered into her ear, "I want to watch you have sex with another man." Her eyes fluttered shut, and her mouth gaped open and she moaned. "I would be happy to," I said at the edge of her ear, "but right now, I want mine to, too."</p> <p>She opened her eyes, looked down at me, and said, "This isn't a one-time thing, Jason. I love being with you, but right now, I care too much for you to take our friendship from me." I didn't want to take our friendship from her, but I knew I would tell her no matter what.</p> <p>"But we will. We can decide where we live now. We can decide what we do. Your mother can decide between you and me. We can decide how far we go," I said and continued to hold her. "We really do love each other."</p> <p>She smiled. "You do." She closed her eyes and stretched her arms up over her head, stretching. "I love you, Jason." Her hips were pressing against me, and I felt her nipples against my chest. I didn't move.</p> <p>I kissed her forehead, and whispered, "I love you too."</p> <p>"Mmm, you're the best," she said.</p> <p>"I hope so," I said, and moved in to kiss her.</p> <p>"No, stop!" she demanded, but I kept kissing her, and I wanted the same kind of kiss that came from a third person.</p> <p>I stopped and kissed her neck, then down to her chest.
