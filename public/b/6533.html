A hand reached out and I could barely feel her hands on mine: there was just too much contact - so much to do - to feel, so she squeezed my hand, and the man was watching, his eyes still on the screen as her hands went to the knot on my arm.</p> <p>There was no way I could keep from slipping a hand around to his shoulder, even if it was as much as hers. My grip was strong, my fingers flexing against hers - the touch, the feel was electric, and my breathing was shallow and heavy - when she pulled my hands and pulled them behind me, to wrap my arms around her waist tightly. I tried to pull away and turn to face the stranger, but her grip tightened around my wrists, and I couldn't move my legs at all.</p> <p>Her voice was deep now, a husky whisper in my ear:</p> <p>"I'm Sam, isn't I Sam?"</p> <p>She paused a heartbeat or two, and I could barely even feel our heads, but I felt it; it was too late to back away, if she wanted her way, even if she didn't know it. Instead she turned to face me, her arm tightening in mine, and she leaned in, pushing her lips hard against mine for a long moment...</p> <p>It got better: she gave me her tongue, and kissed me hard, her lips smacking mine again, her mouth opening as her kiss deepened, and I realized I was kissing her back, feeling her lips hard against mine. Her lips parted, parting slightly, and our tongues met - our heads turning to the other, and our mouths meeting, tongues twisting and dancing in a hot, hot passionate dance.</p> <p>Her hands loosened their grip and my arms got caught in hers, my hands roaming all over her back, her skin hot and taut, and when I finally pulled back, our lips met again, our tongues darting around each others, dancing, teasing each other. Finally the kiss had ended, and I could feel her mouth still against mine, her fingers in my long hair, and I could feel the tightness of her chest as her heart started to thump against mine.</p> <p>We looked at each other, and slowly pulled away, and I heard a long, low giggle. But the man looked at us, as if surprised he wasn't looking at us, or trying to talk. I could see he must have had a full erection, and his hand was starting to slide down the inside of her left thigh. Her eyes widened in surprise as his hand came to rest on her right knee, his fingertips lightly grazing her skin as he began to stroke her stocking, running up her thigh and across her inner thigh from knee to hip, and she moaned.</p> <p>"I hope you like this, Sam" the man said, almost whispering in her ear as he slipped a finger under the strap of her right side, and gently pulled it up and over her left shoulder - one hand now pulling the other side up over her left breast. "I'm Peter, and you are?" he asked, and she nodded.</p> <p>He looked at me, eyes meeting with mine, and then he brought both his hands behind his back and began to take off his jacket.</p> <p>"I'm Bill, and you are?"</p> <p>My eyes were fixed on the zipper - my mouth had gone dry - it was the only thing that seemed all of a sudden to register that I was still wearing my coat.</p> <p>"Sam," he spoke, his eyes still on her breasts, "are you Sam?"</p> <p>The look that passed between us made her look up at him, and she shook her head, and then smiled and whispered something to him. He nodded and her eyes went back to the screen as his hands slid the zipper down. Her eyes met mine again, and she licked her lips.</p> <p>"Yes," she whispered, "Sam, this is Peter."</p> <p>"Yes, Peter" I said.</p> <p>I heard the guy moan softly, and it felt so sexy. But now that Peter was back, his eyes had locked on Sam, her eyes watching him, and suddenly his hands were unzipping his pants, and his cock sprang free, stiff and thick, its head throbbing and pulsating, it's long, pink cock head glistening with the moisture of his excitement.</p> <p>I looked at Sam for a moment, her eyes still locked on his cockhead, and then she leaned forward and licked her lips, smiling at me and taking my hand in hers again, pulling me up from the couch, and we walked up the stairs into her bedroom.
