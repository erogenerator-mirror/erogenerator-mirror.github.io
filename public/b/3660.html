"So what do you do in this city?"</p> <p>He took a sip of his drink and took another swig of whiskey. "How was the flight, I suppose?"</p> <p>She smirked at him. "It was the same. The two of us went to bed at one end of this little stretch of town and snuggled up for the night." Her face was serious, almost serious. "I can't believe you still feel as if you're not dead. Why didn't you say something?"</p> <p>He put the drink down and stood. "I'm not sure I should say that right now. I was a bit overwhelmed by your beauty, as I stood looking it up. I feel responsible for your death."</p> <p>She smiled and took another sip of whiskey. "Well, I guess you probably did anyway."</p> <p>He laughed and sat down in a chair opposite. "I should thank you for not getting me an honorable discharge. And for the most part, you seemed like what you were. A gentleman. And you looked like a good shot. How lucky could I be to have you as my wife?"</p> <p>When she started speaking again, he put a hand on her thigh again and she almost jumped.</p> <p>"I don't mean to intrude, but would it be appropriate to kiss me now?"</p> <p>She looked at him and saw the sparkle in his eye. She smiled at him sweetly, leaned in and planted her lips on his. He closed his eyes as her soft lips lightly kissed his. She pulled away suddenly and smiled at him.</p> <p>"I don't mean to interrupt anything."</p> <p>She kissed his mouth very lightly again. "There will always be a place for everything, right?"</p> <p>"Always," he chuckled, "but what about a little make-up, my lips are getting all red and puffy."</p> <p>"That would make it even more fun for both of us."</p> <p>He laughed as he stood. "And if we take our time, would we really want to rush into a room where we can spend the next hour or two trying to look like we're not old, sweet and innocent?"</p> <p>"You are so sweet!" she said, and kissed him again. He closed his eyes again, leaned back in his chair and looked into her face.</p> <p>She laughed and kissed his cheek softly. "Hm, so we're getting ahead of ourselves, lover boy."</p> <p>She turned to leave but stopped and stood in front of him. Then she took his face gently between her hands and kissed him again. "Now I just have to know what to do." she said as she leaned in and kissed his lips.</p> <p>He opened his mouth and responded, kissing her back ardently. She pulled away and smiled.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, Jack. I just didn't expect the night to end so fast. I was not expecting too much."</p> <p>"All's forgiven!"</p> <p>He smiled and leaned over and kissed her deeply. "Do you feel the same way?"</p> <p>She smiled in return, but then looked over at his face. "I do feel guilty."</p> <p>"Don't be." He leaned over and kissed her again. Again and again he kissed her lips. "I'm sorry it has to be this way, babe. But for all these years, I couldn't ever figure out a way to forgive you. I guess we have to find another way."</p> <p>"How?"</p> <p>She turned and went to the bathroom. As she was peeing, it was very apparent that he still liked her, even if it was difficult. He went behind her and pulled her against his chest. "Don't worry, you'll always feel in control. Besides, I think I have a really good idea who you're married to before I even start kissing you."</p> <p>She grinned, and kissed his ear. "I think I'm in love with you, Jack."</p> <p>Her face turned red and she smiled.</p> <p>=======<>=======</p> <p>He had been looking forward to her being home. They were going through a divorce and he thought there was nothing he could do to change it. He knew he was in love with her, but he couldn't think of anything that would change the situation. He could say she hated him, but he knew deep, dark secrets underneath her exterior. She seemed to be the one who could get through to him.</p> <p>But tonight would be different and he had to be prepared.</p> <p>When she walked up to him for the third time that evening, he could tell she wanted him. He took full advantage in his stance. He had always wanted her; she had always had him.</p> <p>They had met over coffee. They had sat down, and he had started to pour himself a glass of wine.
