I stood right next to them.</p> <p>They were so frozen, then I saw the girl laying naked below the dock. Her hands were tied together above her head and she was also naked.</p> <p>She looked like a doll.</p> <p>I walked up to them and she tried to scream, but her lips were thin.</p> <p>I looked at her.</p> <p>What do you say to me?</p> <p>Do I say?</p> <p>I looked at her.</p> <p>What do you want?</p> <p>I looked at her.</p> <p>Do I tell you to do anything you want, or just do it?</p> <p>Do you mean the same thing as the other people?</p> <p>How do you know that?</p> <p>If you give me this chance I will give you a real chance.</p> <p>That is why I said yes.</p> <p>Did you give me a chance to make you happy? Do you mean the opportunity to be free?</p> <p>Yes, I did.</p> <p>I walked closer to her, and I touched her thigh, then she jumped.</p> <p>I put my hands on her bare thighs, and they were so cold.</p> <p>I saw her legs start to tremble again.</p> <p>I told her to lift one leg.</p> <p>Then I started rubbing her between her thighs.</p> <p>She was very tense at first, then started to move her thighs, but I kept going.</p> <p>When she was on her first leg, I lifted it up a bit, and she was moving her leg slowly in front of me.</p> <p>She was looking at my face and then she got scared.</p> <p>She was afraid.</p> <p>I rubbed the outside of her thighs, and when the skin was almost touching, I started to rub her vagina through her shorts.</p> <p>She moaned loudly, and her head looked upwards.</p> <p>I continued this for a while, and she started to shiver.</p> <p>I took her shorts off while she was looking at me.</p> <p>She was not wearing any knickers!</p> <p>My eyes went directly there, then I looked at her pussy.</p> <p>A large mound, full lips at the bottom, a pink, hairy cunt!</p> <p>I just kept looking at it for a moment.</p> <p>I saw a tear drop on the skin on between her legs.</p> <p>She was trembling all over, and I kept looking at it and watching it and feeling it.</p> <p>When I looked at her, she was still trembling, but her face looked beautiful.</p> <p>I touched the sides of her cunt. There was a big, shiny wetness, but no cum was leaking.</p> <p>I looked again at her eyes, looked at her face, and I was in love with the sexiness of it.</p> <p>In spite of everything I felt so excited at it, that I started to touch it.</p> <p>She was getting really frightened now.</p> <p>I started to squeeze her pussy lips. They were so large that they were almost all squeezed together in front of her nose.</p> <p>She was shaking wildly.</p> <p>I had never touched a woman like this, I was so mesmerized.</p> <p>Then I started to kiss her face.</p> <p>I kissed her all over.</p> <p>She was breathing hard, so I had to put my arms around her neck from behind her.</p> <p>Her breath was very heavy, and she started to pant.</p> <p>I kept kissing her, and she was moaning and trembling, and it made me very excited.</p> <p>I put my finger on her, and she started to push in her leg.</p> <p>I gave her a little push.</p> <p>She froze again.</p> <p>I took her in my arms, and moved around her.</p> <p>She had changed up the angle of her stance, and her knees were now on her chest and back.</p> <p>I moved to her and put my nose on her pussy. She was shivering, but she was shaking so much that I had to kiss her.</p> <p>I kissed her lips, she gave a long moan.</p> <p>I kept kissing her lips and then I put my mouth on her.
