There was a faint sound of the mattress beneath his weight, a soft rustle of bedding. He'd come, of course, but this was just what I was hoping for. This was my turn to play.</p> <p>"Ah!" He exclaimed almost too much for his own good.</p> <p>I knew I had my answer. His cock was rock hard now, and he moved his hips ever so slightly, trying to draw me into it as far as his body would allow.</p> <p>"It's OK," I comforted him as I lowered my head to kiss the nape of his neck.</p> <p>"Is it OK, baby?" I asked him as I sucked a nipple into my mouth as his breathing picked up a bit, and his hand moved down to stroke the base of my breast.</p> <p>"Oh, it's so good." I told him with my own breath in his ear.</p> <p>I could feel one of his hands sliding up the inside of my thighs, one finger searching for the warmth that filled my folds, and the palm of his hand cupping the breast beneath as he pressed the head of his cock to the opening of my pussy. He pushed the head in, and I was sure this was my sign of how deeply he wanted me.</p> <p>I raised myself onto my elbows as he pushed another couple inches of the rigid cock into my channel. Now he was fully lodged in me. I lifted myself slightly higher, allowing more of him to be set free into me.</p> <p>I began moving my hips to match his rhythm, matching his as he moved his cock in and out of me. My legs were almost up around his waist as I pushed back against him with each thrust, until I felt some tension in the head of his cock, and an intense warmth rising in my belly.</p> <p>Before I was completely sure what was about to happen, I felt him stiffen, and his cum begin pumping into me as I felt my body spasm in his arms. He leaned forward, his lips finding the sensitive nub at the top of my canal, sucking the sensitive skin into his mouth. I pressed my pussy into him, and felt him cum too, grunting softly as he pushed another small amount of his seed into the tight opening of my cunt.</p> <p>We stood there for several minutes, his penis still buried within me, his warm, hard cock resting within me. I was breathing heavily, my heart beat heavily behind my chest. I kissed him on the cheek, and he kissed me on my ear.</p> <p>After a few moments, we stood still, holding each other close to each other. He felt the weight of my breasts against his chest, and I felt the hardness of his manhood pressed between my thighs.</p> <p>We looked into each other's eyes for several moments, holding one another in the darkness, the passion of the moment making it seem impossible. We had neither spoken one word of our desires, and neither was there any need to be. Our breaths were the only sounds from this deep space of our being.</p> <p>When our breaths had settled enough, I felt his hand on my ass, sliding slightly, just enough to feel him pulling himself fully out of me. It was only then that the feeling passed, and I heard the sound of his hands on my cheeks, kneading them as he began pushing his member back into me.</p> <p>I closed my eyes, enjoying the sensation as he slid his cock back and forth, feeling our bodies rubbing together, enjoying the feel of my body in his hands. Then I felt him move away and I could feel his cock, now free of its confines, against my pussy. He moved backwards so he was lying on our ends, facing me.</p> <p>"What about you, lover?" He asked as he moved to embrace me.</p> <p>"I'm tired." I assured him. "It doesn't feel as good as I imagined."</p> <p>He was still lying on his back. He wrapped his arm around me, and I could feel him pulling me up onto him, the weight of his body on top of me.</p> <p>"Oh, we're going to do so much more than you imagined, lover." I told him. "I still can't believe how good it feels to have you inside of me."</p> <p>His hands began to wander, but he had other plans. He pulled me closer to him, and he gently laid me on my back, with my upper leg straight up into the air, giving him complete access as he moved toward me.</p> <p>His hands went to my breasts, his hands moving down over them, kneading them with him as he moved himself back and forth, pressing against me, feeling his hardness up against me.</p> <p>"Now we can do anything we want," I told himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
