She said, turning around. "Okay, come on in here!" She said, beckoning her over.</p> <p>My mind was a whirlwind of thoughts! What was I going to wear? What was I going to look like? What perfume? She seemed a little breathless as she took off her clothes.</p> <p>"I thought I'd dress like a girl if that was what you thought I'd look like," I said.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" She asked.</p> <p>"You're wearing a bra, too."</p> <p>She grinned. "I'm not sure if I'd get a bra, either. But, hey..." She put the top down on the bed next to me. "It's just that..."</p> <p>"No, no, sweetie, nothing like that!" I blurted out. "You're not wearing a real bra, aren't you?" She nodded her head.</p> <p>"No," she said, a little more quietly. "If you want me to get a bra I'll go without it at this point."</p> <p>I started getting nervous. "But, what's the big deal?" She said.</p> <p>"The big deal," she said as she pushed her hands under her breasts and shook them like they were made of some soft, sexy substance. "Nothing for the nerves!"</p> <p>My hands were shaking with excitement. "What's the big deal? I mean, I know you're not going to like it."</p> <p>"I don't like that at all," she said, "but I'm sure you didn't just look at my cleavage all night, either." She winked at me with a smile, her hands moving just as fast, one hand gripping the strap of one side of her bra and the other one reaching up to rub her swollen nipple through the thin material.</p> <p>I was beginning to get a little dizzy from her touch.</p> <p>"Can I see?" she asked.</p> <p>"Not yet," I said, trying to catch my breath. "Just relax, okay?"</p> <p>"You're... you're so much more..." Her voice quivered as her arousal grew and the pressure of her fingers grew. I couldn't take it anymore. I stepped in front of her, reached out and lightly ran my fingers just under her right breast.</p> <p>"Yeah, I do, too," she said, "you can touch me, too." I couldn't tell if she was intentionally trying to tease me or if she was actually hinting at things. Either way, she was definitely getting aroused.</p> <p>I couldn't help but reach out and run my fingertips along her nipple, then down her belly, down to her belly button. It felt so soft and smooth. For a moment I forgot what it felt like to be touched by a woman's breasts, and then I realized that maybe it wasn't me at all.</p> <p>"You like that, don't you?" she asked.</p> <p>I was breathing hard. "Yeah, I like that," I said. Then I felt her shift a little in the bed. "Uh-huh," she said.</p> <p>"That's right, sweetie," she purred, a touch and a pinch on the nipple. "I like what you're doing." Her fingers tightened on her nipple, and she gently began to twist it. It seemed as if she was trying to get more pressure on my sensitive end.</p> <p>"What's this?" she asked. I could tell that she was trying to find the right size size. I just hoped that this was the size that the skin of my finger was. I could just make out small circles with my fingertip.</p> <p>"Mmm, uh-huh," she cooed. "Nice and wet, too."</p> <p>"Oh, uh..." I stuttered. I looked over at the side table I'd dropped my bag and I saw that this one was empty.</p> <p>"There's this one," she said. She grabbed a small box off a stand on the wall, leaned back and spread her legs. She raised them slightly, bringing her pussy directly in line with the edge of the bed. With just that little bit of pressure on her nipple, I felt more than saw a drop of her moisture just slide down and between her swollen lips.</p> <p>I looked over to the other side of the bed. She must have read my mind.</p> <p>"Do you like me to rub my pussy?" She asked. I nodded my head, trying to get the feeling back into my head. "Would you like that a little?" She asked again.</p> <p>"Uhu-uh," I whispered, "please." I didn't really have the vocabulary yet, but I knew that if my throat was in any sort of a quiver, I would probably be in a quivering mess in the morningâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
