The thought quickly vanished in her mind when she started to wonder if there were people in this house, and if there were people doing it at the same time.</p> <p>"That might work with him," Lisa said, and then went to stand close to him. She felt his arms and arm slide up her sides when she turned to face him. Their bodies were so close that they could even kiss. That was the only thing they could do. She pulled her lips back and moved her face toward him. She could kiss him right through his sweater. Now, they felt they could do more.</p> <p>And then she felt his fingers on her shoulders, reaching around and sliding under the neckline of her sweater and pulling it upward. Her breasts came undone when he pulled the taut material out from under her sweater. He slid his fingers along the soft skin over her chest beneath the thin, silky bra. His fingertips teased her nipple, sending tingles through her body. He slid his hands down the front of her body, his hands cupping her full breasts. He squeezed them together, and then moved his hands down, along the valley between the mounds, and then back up again. Again, he slid to his knee, and then pushed the bra off her shoulders. He leaned toward her, and as she leaned against him, their lips were pressed together. Then his lips moved lower, and his tongue slid into her mouth a moment later. She felt his arms slide around her body as he pulled her tight against him, and his fingers tightened on her breasts. They broke the kiss.</p> <p>"I think we can do pretty good at this," he whispered to her.</p> <p>"I don't think that we can do good, either," Lisa answered.</p> <p>"Let's go upstairs, and I'll show you what we can do." He guided her back up the front stairs, and guided her past a room and into the door to the master bedroom. She felt her heart racing and her breathing quicken as he walked her upstairs. He led her into the living room, and sat her on the loveseat. He removed his sweater, and her eyes fell to his chest as she gazed at his six-pack. He had been doing nothing since he got out of the car, and his abs were already clearly defined. He stood at attention and walked toward her, holding out his hands. Lisa reached for them, and they were soon at each other's belt, unbuckling and unbuttoning his jeans. His cock was long and almost purple-black as it sprang free from his pants. He moved his hands onto Lisa's bare hips, helping her ease the jeans slowly down her legs. Now she had on a light blue pair of panties, that contrasted with her pale skin and hair. His eyes followed those dark, inviting legs, down over her shapely feet, and then back up again to her face. She noticed that their eyes met.</p> <p>"You're beautiful," his eyes said as he kissed her on the lips. "I could do with a few of those too!"</p> <p>Lisa nodded her head, and felt a tingle run through her body at his words. Her hands went to his, pressing him gently to her. Her lips parted as they kissed, inviting him back. She felt his hands cup her hips, and he pulled her towards him. Their bodies were pressed tightly together, and both could hear the faint wet smack of their lips when his body pressed against hers. She was suddenly aware that she really wanted this to happen. She couldn't decide whether she needed to stop him, or not.</p> <p>She reached down and unfastened his jeans, then began taking them off, letting the silky black fabric slide down his legs. She pulled his pants and underwear down, sliding his right leg through hers. His cock rose as it was revealed, and he kicked his shoes off as he tossed them aside. His mouth dropped to hers, and their tongues danced. He pulled away a moment and moved over to his bag. Lisa watched him as he rummaged around, looking at both her and his tools with approval. He came back to her and lifted her up slightly. His cock pressed against her sex, nudging gently against her pubic bone again and again. Lisa couldn't believe this was happening again.</p> <p>"Let us start this," he said, looking around. "Let's go into this room."</p> <p>"I didn't think we were going to do any stuff," Lisa replied.</p> <p>Lisa stood as he opened the door, and they walked up the stairs to the next room. She followed him, watching him as he stripped off his shirt. She walked as he tossed it aside, and he undid his pants. He moved his hands to her waist, and slowly beganâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
