Let's just see what happens and if I let him shoot his stuff in a minute, that would be two-minutes."</p> <p>"Honey," I said, "We may as well go at it; we don't have all night! And if he's not on the table before the waiter gets back with a fresh drink, why don't you order up to your room and we'll go for it? That way you'll be on your own for the next hour!"</p> <p>As soon as the waiter brought me my coffee; Sarah led me into the dining area and to the door of her room.</p> <p>I looked around briefly then looked back at Sarah. "Sarah!" I said looking her up and down. "How beautiful you are!"</p> <p>"That's what I wanted to do after I saw you. And thank you! I thought I'd never get any food laid before, and your kisses and caresses must have turned me on, too. Now we are going to do it!"</p> <p>"I want to eat my man alive. If that's what he wants, we're going to do it!"</p> <p>We stripped off our clothes with our mouths and sat side by side on her bed, naked as the day we were born, and she pulled the covers all the way back off us. She then crawled up on top of me and kissed me deeply as her hand worked its way southward between my legs. I felt the hardness beneath her and was aware of my breathing coming in shallow gasps when she touched down on my clitoris. She then slid two of her index fingers into my pussy and stroked me, going up and down on my labia until I was sure her fingers would go in and out. She continued to pleasure me, using her fingers, tongue and mouth to tantalize my clitoris while she rubbed her hands over my breasts and nipples.</p> <p>When the pace of her masturbation increased, so did the pressure on my clitoris, which she increased in tempo until I thought she would bring me to a climax at any second. But as soon as her tongue and fingers found their way to my clit, I exploded into a strong orgasm, my body shaking and quivering.</p> <p>She then took the fingers of her right hand and wet them in her mouth and took them in and stroked them as she stroked herself, and she made a sucking sound as she finished her climax. "You taste good like that!" she said.</p> <p>"Didn't happen, Sarah! It was incredible!" I said, thinking of where my climax came from. My legs had gone limp but for the moment, I was thinking of someplace else.</p> <p>"Oh, you're such a good kisser! I hope our waiter will approve!" she said and leaned back against the bed. She then went back down on me as though she were starved.</p> <p>I tried to control my trembling and found myself trying not to think about what had just happened between us, about what we had just done together, but I was lost deep in a swirl of eroticism. I don't think that words were going to make anything right, but I managed a series of coherent sentences.</p> <p>"I've never done anything like that before. But it sure felt nice! I hope we can do it again; I'm not sure how I'll know when we get another chance for more!"</p> <p>"Sarah! Oh, Baby! Your kisses are so wonderful!"</p> <p>"I know," she said, "and I hope I will be able to show you how good I know!" We then had several more intense love making sessions.</p> <p>My mind was in overdrive and I was on the verge of having an orgasm whenever either of us made a sound. I don't know how I was able to last more than three seconds or so. "Sarah," I said, "if we stop now and get off we'll never stop fucking!"</p> <p>She rolled off me without losing contact with my body but kept her hand at my pussy while I trembled with desire. "We're not gonna do it again, aren't we?" she asked and then said, "I've never thought of it like that!"</p> <p>I said, "Of course not! Do you know about the time I ate your pussy after I brought you off in bed with my finger?"</p> <p>"Yes. Why, do you? And that's when I'd better be ready!"</p> <p>I laughed. "I'll put the thought to you before we move beyond doing things I wouldn't even consider," I said, "but we'll be thinking about you the whole time we're doing this! And yes, I would like to have you back when we get home!"</p> <p>I then got the impression that she had a desire to have her pussy sucked by a guy! And, I also thought that she thought that Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
