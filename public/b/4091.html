He'd taken her on a roller coaster of emotions. But still, when he pulled back, he saw how happy she was. It was the moment when the passion began to build again and the light began to shine under her eyes. "No!" she said angrily. "I'm not a little girl any more. You have no right to treat me this way..."</p> <p>"I already asked one of the other girls," he said, cutting her off again. "But you asked for this. Tell me you want me to give it to you again."</p> <p>There was a long pause in her voice. He could feel it. Maybe because he was her boyfriend. He decided to tease her a little. "Tell me you want to see yourself... naked," he said teasingly.</p> <p>"I..." her voice was barely a whisper. She hesitated. A moment later and he saw the fear in her eyes. Fear at her inexperience.</p> <p>He leaned closer. "You can't possibly say no. We already have."</p> <p>"But I couldn't..."</p> <p>He touched the palm of his other hand to her cheek. "And you will, soon enough. For now, I think you'd like to get back to your boyfriend and find out just how much he'll appreciate what you have left."</p> <p>She looked so innocent. She had to be a virgin. He liked that a little. But he wasn't sure if that was an option when she got back to him. Maybe she really did think he'd be interested. "I didn't just sleep with you," she began. But he didn't let up his tease, "I... slept with every girl I've ever had."</p> <p>"Then come back to me. We can get back to that. It's been hard on both of us. Now that we're back, I'll have your clothes."</p> <p>"Please," her voice shook slightly as she looked at him.</p> <p>He smiled. He liked that.</p> <p>"No," she said.</p> <p>"No?" He was still amused. This girl was going to be difficult. She sounded terrified and confused.</p> <p>She looked so innocent and naïve. But he couldn't take his eyes off her legs. Her skin was tanned and smooth. His hand started to work its way down her naked thigh as he stared. Her lips were wet, her clit was erect and pointed right at his face. His fingers rubbed the slick folds of her vagina as he leaned forward, his eyes locked with hers. "It isn't..." she began, but he cut her off by moving his hand to between her legs and pushing her legs apart firmly so his face was positioned right below her vagina. She watched as his hot, thick tongue snaked out and licked her again. "Oh... wow. It's... so... good, isn't it," she moaned. "Yeah... it.... isn't... horrible," she finished as his tongue slid inside her slowly and gently... pushing inside the tight walls of her virgin vagina.</p> <p>"You... your girlfriend... I... couldn't..."</p> <p>She blushed and moved to reach down and take his head in her hand. But he stopped her and pulled her back against him.</p> <p>"Do you want to fuck her?" He asked. He loved hearing her beg. She looked as helpless as she usually did with him, but his eyes were as big as saucers. His erection was pulsing against her lower thigh as he pressed his lips firmly against her.</p> <p>"Oh... I... uh..."</p> <p>"Yes you will. Come to me. You want to fuck her." And he slid his own hands up the front of her shirt so that he could feel her breasts. They were small, not big but not fat either. Her pink nipples were small and hard. He pinched them gently, felt them get harder the harder he pinched. He couldn't understand what possessed him to do what he did, but he couldn't stop. His fingers felt her hard nipples through her shirt as he pulled her towards him, feeling the warmth of her skin and the firmness of her young body against his. He heard a long, wet moan come out of her throat and leaned forward to cup her breast. They were small and firm and perfectly rounded. He squeezed around her small firmness and began to move his fingers around them while he ground her against him slightly. "No... You just don't want to..." she protested.</p> <p>He leaned in a little harder, pressing his body all the harder into hers. Her body moved to meet his. And she was responding with a kind of pleasure he hadn't felt previously. "Come with me," he urged. "Come to me."</p> <p>He had been watching this before, and he'd had a few things—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
