It's true, for a moment or two she'd been thinking about it so, but she was sure that I'd been so stupidly, selfishly, careless; she didn't want this, no matter how much she and I had enjoyed having sex.</p> <p>As she looked at me and smiled, a strange feeling ran through her, a weird feeling that the person in her eyes was looking at her intently, not looking at her, the person in her legs, the person in her hair. But there was no mistaking the effect she was having on her; not by the looks she was getting from my face or from my tongue, from my touch; but by the way her legs suddenly started to shake. It wasn't sexual in the least, but something that didn't stop my fingers going up and down her leg; she was coming again, coming in her pantyhose as she looked me straight on.</p> <p>"Ohh...Ohh...Ohh...Ahhh..." she gasped. "Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh yes...oh god." That made me even more determined to make this girl come while I made her come. I just couldn't help myself. And for whatever reason, I knew that she wouldn't mind at all. I got it. That's exactly what I was now looking for; to have the kind of physical pleasure that girls, women in particular, are capable of.</p> <p>She put her legs down and I was surprised to see that the rest of her body was still shaking, and was still coming. She looked at me again and smiled. She ran her hand down the inside of her thigh and back up again. Just barely enough, I thought. She looked like she was going to take something and start to rub it, but she didn't. She just kept her hands down with her hands flat on the mattress and spread her legs as wide as she could.</p> <p>"I think I'm going to need to get an icepack... for sure." She said, taking off her pantyhose. "And that's it boys," she said, and turned to me, "come over here then and see for yourself, that's right."</p> <p>I did as she said, trying to hold in my excitement at the idea of watching her come. Of watching her; the sight of her, her body, her lips, her lips -- the whole picture I was taking in and out in a moment -- was all I could take. I got up, moved between her spread thighs and got down in between them. Her pantyhose was already gone, but I could smell the strong scent of her juices and felt her tremble around my head.</p> <p>"Do you think you'll be able to hold off as long as you really need to, Mr. Moore?" she asked playfully. "If you don't, we don't want that tongue hanging out of the front of the thing any more, right?"</p> <p>The thought of tasting her made me want to come, all of her, so I said, "Yes."</p> <p>That was enough for her. She put her hands on my arms and smiled as she smiled back at me.</p> <p>"I said do you want to hold out some longer?" she asked, and I did. "It's been way too long," she said.</p> <p>I was so excited; I was nearly ready to blow by now. With my hand I found her bare pussy with my middle finger and rubbed it in a circular motion, feeling her shudder on the top of my hand.</p> <p>Finally, she closed her eyes and put her head in the middle of her chest. Her arms lay limp at her sides as she leaned back on her elbows. Without opening her eyes, she looked down at me and smiled; and then, it was my turn to look as well.</p> <p>Her skin was covered in a sheen of sweat, her stomach and chest heaved and her legs were trembling as I reached up to touch her legs. Her legs seemed to move with me as I brought my hand back down towards her pussy. She moved my hand up and put my fingers into hers, pulling them back to her lips. I took one of my fingers, and slowly, I used my middle finger to rub along the bottom of her puss, sliding a finger down towards her clit. Even in the darkness of the room, she could still see my hand; I took the middle finger by the top lip and slowly, ever so slowly, put it inside her, making her come almost completely before my finger went back to her clit.</p> <p>Again. It was nearly time as she opened her eyes and looked at me.</p> <p>"Go ahead... just do it..." she said. "Go slow... and do it really slowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
