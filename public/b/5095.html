After a second or two, when the first part of the movie was about eight seconds long, the camera zoomed in slowly around the action, and I knew immediately that this man had the presence of mind to be watching this movie in such a position for me to be doing to myself.</p> <p>I sat back down and put my hands behind my head, trying to get comfortable. I put the remote control on the side table, and went over to the DVD player. Before I did this, I turned the volume up a little bit, hoping nobody would walk by while I had been watching the movie myself. Just to make sure, there was a note on the table that didn't have a title.</p> <p>Before I could continue, the DVD was still open. I found the menu in the player, and clicked play. There were three movies on this disc, one with another couple getting sucked off in a bed. I picked one out of the collection, and pressed play.</p> <p>"What do you think, guys?" asked the man holding the door for me. "It could be for the best."</p> <p>His eyes lit up, like he wanted to ask, but was afraid to ask. I looked him over. I did what I had done that first time, I knew I could not be bothered to undress, and I didn't have to. He was already naked and sitting on the bed, his legs spread open.</p> <p>"Um... what does it look like?"</p> <p>"A little bit of a blur from what we can tell, maybe."</p> <p>"So, who are you?" I asked, trying to keep the excitement out of my voice.</p> <p>He just looked at me a bit, and then said "I'm Michael."</p> <p>"Just call me Charlie." I said casually.</p> <p>He smiled and said, "So, what do you do?"</p> <p>"I'm a photographer. I'm doing some photography." I said, and he immediately looked down at my crotch. "Don't embarrass me."</p> <p>Michael smiled. "You haven't been taking photographs yet!" He started undressing. I reached down and took off my pants and shirt, and followed suit, leaving me naked and sitting just out of sight in the hallway of some sort of studio. He just stood in front of the mirror above the closet while I removed my socks. "That looks great. Where did you get that?"</p> <p>"I thought that was in my garage," he said, trying to look away.</p> <p>"Are you sure you're up to a job?" I asked.</p> <p>"I really don't mind doing some photography," he said.</p> <p>I just smiled. Michael walked over to stand in the closet next to me. He stood behind me, and placed his hands on my shoulders as if he was going to rub them. I couldn't see his fingers as they came down. He rubbed my neck and shoulders, working his way down my arms, rubbing me in slow circles, getting more and more relaxed as he did so.</p> <p>He moved his hands over my shoulders and down over my body. Slowly, he worked his thumbs in a circular motion around my stomach, then came back up again to my shoulders and neck. He began working his way down my chest with his fingers, occasionally kissing me. I just smiled at him and reached for the remote, and turned the TV on.</p> <p>"Nice," I said, and he got a wicked grin in his eyes. He turned my back up to face him. My hands went behind my neck. I could have kissed him a long time ago, but I didn't, and the way he was looking at me made me uncomfortable.</p> <p>"You have a lovely body. I think you should make some decent cash for us, don't you?" he asked. I just smiled.</p> <p>"Well, if it's what you're looking for and you want something, we're more than going to be a one-night-a-night kind of entertainment, right?"</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sure there's a line if you have that much to lose. Don't you think Charlie?" I said sarcastically. We looked at each other for a minute, my hands still behind my neck.</p> <p>"Oh, you do have a way about you," he said. "I'm glad to hear you saying that."</p> <p>"I was just trying to tease," I responded.</p> <p>He had that smirk in his eyes again, and was rubbing my arms and neck, and I began to squirm. He stepped closer and moved both hands to my arms, starting over my hands. He began to knead my forearms as he worked his handsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
