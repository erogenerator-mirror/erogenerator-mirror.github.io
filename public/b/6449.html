They spent most of the day having sex - at one time with her, at another, at others - but after a while they got into bed together a little. Neither wanted to spoil the mood by being "too rough" in their lovemaking. That night they both felt wonderful, so tender, and their feelings for one another were still strong. "What do you do when you get home tonight?"</p> <p>"I'm glad I'm home," she said. "I can't remember when it felt so safe to be out of bed. I'd love to do this again."</p> <p>"You're not sure about that?"</p> <p>"I'm not sure," she said. "I'm just happy to have you back in my life now."</p> <p>"Me too."</p> <p>***</p> <p>She went to work the next day, with a smile on her face. She knew she'd have a great time with the man that she wanted. There was one problem though: he had been the object of her desire for a long time. This was the man she'd fallen in love with.</p> <p>She finished her day of work, went to her house and made herself dinner on the patio. It wasn't long before she could smell the faint scent of fresh cologne on the air from her garden. As she passed the backdoor, she saw the man leaning against the doorway.</p> <p>"You up for something special? I'd really like to have dinner with you tonight."</p> <p>She smiled. "I'm good for an evening on the town. I'm glad I can be of service and not be too late."</p> <p>"I'm starving," he said. He was wearing a long, flowing shirt and slacks. He turned from the door, walked over and took hers from her. He bent down to kiss her, taking her into his arms. She felt warm.</p> <p>"Let's go out on the patio and enjoy a glass of wine," he said. "I don't have a lot of time tomorrow, but if you'd like to go out for some fun, I'd love to join you. I'm not sure I can wait. If you're OK with that, that would be great. You may even have to let me take a rain check."</p> <p>She thought about this. She'd loved to have a drink with him. The wine was making her a little woozy, and the idea of him sharing the bottle with her was exciting. "I'd really like to come, as long as you are OK with this." Then she heard the sound of his belt unbuckling. She opened her eyes just a little to see the bulge in his slacks. She gave a little gasp. "You might get a little excited, though."</p> <p>"Why should I get excited? I think I'm going to want to be with this man every minute of the day."</p> <p>"Oh, don't think about that. You're going to need all the encouragement you can possibly muster to keep things going."</p> <p>He dropped to his knees and pushed his face deep into her crotch. He licked her through the thin, moist lips that surrounded the organ that she so craved and her eyes closed and she let out a soft moan. "Mmm," she moaned again, "That feels nice." He slid his mouth and tongue up and down the length of her vulva, causing her to jerk and jump against his face. Then he pressed his face between her legs, making his way down to her opening and pressing his tongue against it. Then he slipped his tongue as far inside her as he could before pulling it out while pressing it hard against her clitoris and sucking it as hard as he could.</p> <p>When he came up to kiss her, she was still reeling from the intensity of their lovemaking. "What's the matter, honey?"</p> <p>"Nothing," she said, "I'm just glad you are here, just let me call you and see if we can arrange something."</p> <p>"OK, baby," he said with a smile. "I love you, and you can call me anytime. If you have anything else you'd like to do, I'm here."</p> <p>She was about to walk him to his car when she remembered her cell phone - she still had it. She got up, turned off the light before returning to the patio. "Honey, I have something to say, but I can't talk right now. Something is definitely on my mind."</p> <p>He sat there as if he'd just made a decision, but he simply looked at her for a long moment. Then he rose to his feet. "I can't answer this phone. Please just call me whenever."</p> <p>Sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
