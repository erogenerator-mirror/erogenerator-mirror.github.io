And I'm sure the rest of her words were like that, but all I could feel in my head was pleasure.</p> <p>And then she pulled her legs back to her chest, pulling me tighter to her, pushing harder into me.</p> <p>"Ohhhhh, Chris, Chris, Chris," she moaned, "Come with me, Chris. Come with me, Chris, Chris," she said. She held onto me tightly, just enjoying the sensation of it all, as I rode her, as I tried to grind harder against her.</p> <p>Then she let go, lifted her feet at my shoulders, dropping them back down to the ground. Then she lifted that leg up, pushing herself back to meet me with each thrust. It was as though we were just fucking.</p> <p>And there it was again - a little bit of a pause, just as we had in the car, almost a feeling of a long pause and then we were going at it again. But then she looked right at me and winked at me, and I did nothing but groan and try to thrust into her. She let go, looked back at me, but I wouldn't meet her gaze, too busy focusing on getting off again. For the most part, though, I didn't see any movement for a second or so until she let go with one long sigh and I felt her pussy clasp around my dick.</p> <p>Her fingers slipped off my shoulders but she couldn't really do it with us as we were on the bed. We rolled completely onto our sides, both of us still on the bed, her back against the pillows, and we embraced.</p> <p>"I love you," she murmured. I was a little surprised at this. But she didn't say it again, which I suppose was good.</p> <p>"I love you, too, too," I said, and we lay perfectly still for a minute.</p> <p>"I love you too, Chris. And this will never happen again, but, I have to tell you - it's my way to express how much I love you."</p> <p>And that is what we are telling each other, isn't it. I loved her too, but I thought we were the same way, not just physically. I loved her to - or rather, I loved and wanted her to - explore what a person can become in a year or two if it feels like what they are experiencing. To make the experience, whatever there might be in the mind, feel like something that is.</p> <p>In the first round, our emotions went for a while longer, then we lay back, holding each other tightly. And we were very quiet, just enjoying those moments we had, the moment when we would be, just enjoying that and letting one another feel.</p> <p>In the evenings of that second year, we would share those moments. The nights when we would be at the same school as the others, and in between, and of course, it would be different. We'd spend the night together, often at the same room, as we often did with the others at the time, but I'd have the last night of it and this was just the beginning of the first few years. We were lovers for a year, as we had for a year before I turned eighteen.</p> <p>We both knew how much we were going to love each other. We'd both been very close with that first year - and I knew it, even if it didn't count as our second year. But we wanted to give up so much of what was left of it all. And we wanted, no, needed this to change all that we had.</p> <p>I know it was difficult trying to get us to love each other as we did, until I found a guy I liked and I'd met him - in the bar, when I was in my early twenties - and we started to make out. I was surprised at how easy it was to take things slowly, and to be able to stop the progression of that by not forcing ourselves to really do anything. But I never let up just because it got too hard to do. Especially, I think, because I really didn't want to let it go any further.</p> <p>I never really knew if I could do that, but it hadn't. I never really put any pressure on. Until now.</p> <p>And then my mother came, and I went back in to do myself, while she was away. But I was glad, because I was feeling the same way. That's something for me to be more of.</p> <p>And then, I started to see that this would end. There'd be no going back. I wouldn't lose anything. I'd be one of the first people to ever lose the best thing that a relationship can be. And it would be that last.
