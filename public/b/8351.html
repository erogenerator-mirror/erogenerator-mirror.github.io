What's wrong with me?" Taryn asked, worried.</p> <p>"Come on, I know what's wrong with you," I said, reaching out to touch her shoulder. "I think I will explain in short order. First we have to know if you are going to be ok with this. And secondly, what exactly happened when you and John came out?"</p> <p>"What happened when you went by the mall to fuck his wife?"</p> <p>I started to laugh, "I don't mean to pry, but yes, and yes, and I will tell you, I really did. I was just waiting for them to get over it because you were with Jason in front of me all along, before he stopped. I was just waiting for your answer. I knew it was wrong for us to do this, and that is why I couldn't trust you. That's why we are sitting here together now."</p> <p>"What about you? You know he is a slut and you are married. I don't blame you," Taryn said, as she grabbed my still rock hard dick, wrapping her fingers around the base. "I don't think Jason would even think about his wife letting it go that far again, especially not from my brother! We'll see. Just know that the only things we talked about were for fun, and not a sexual thing. When John went by you told him to wait until then to get you out of there."</p> <p>"Yeah right!" Taryn said laughing like the idiot she was, as she gave my dick another squeeze. "I was going to tell you, but I didn't know you cared for each other, and I guess I forgot. Oh sorry, that was a stupid question, and now I feel like I am going to lose my temper. What you said to me was pretty much the same thing as what you said is true. So, what is it that we have to talk about now?"</p> <p>As she let my dick drop from her hands, she put it between her legs again, and again stroked me while she asked me this question that made it even harder. I was still trying to catch my breath as she continued to stroke me. After a minute of this she stopped and pulled her hands away from my dick, saying, "I thought I might have misjudged that one. I didn't mean to make you feel bad, you know?"</p> <p>I tried to be even more honest with her, saying, "Taryn, it has nothing to do with you."</p> <p>"That's exactly right. No, it doesn't. It has something to do with me. I have found that the more I try to talk to you the more it makes me feel sexy and attractive to you. You have an incredibly beautiful body. I have seen you in a bathing suit and on my swim team, you have the body of a professional swimmer. Even in the cold, you are beautiful!" Taryn laughed at that very flattering statement, but made the rest of the statement with a look over her shoulder.</p> <p>"I know you don't mean that you didn't know. I just wasn't expecting the same thing from you, and that is probably why I am not even attracted to you."</p> <p>"I'm not attracted to you. You probably thought the same thing about me," I said, my heart pounding up into my chest. I knew she would agree with me. I knew it was time to end the verbal teasing.</p> <p>"You are my brother, I love you even if you are my brother. So stop teasing me for even a minute. Now, get up on the couch, and lie down," Taryn ordered.</p> <p>I scrambled to my feet. I didn't really want to move but I didn't want to say anything. I didn't want to see what she was planning on doing to me next. I was still trying to catch my breath when Taryn walked over to the couch, picked up my hand, and laid down next to me, in a heartbeat. She reached down and touched my dick again.</p> <p>"That's your brother, isn't it?" Taryn laughed, still stroking me. "He is a complete nerd, just like me. And now he is mine." The two women started kissing each other gently, and started feeling each other up all over again. Taryn grabbed my dick again. "You seem rather hard, how would you like us to finish this off?" she asked.</p> <p>"You would not even get this hard. That's the wrong thing to do." I knew the words were coming out of my mouth, and thought it was best to try to keep them as honest as possible.</p> <p>"Well, I don't know. It is not that I didn't see how you were getting all excited over my brother. He sure can make a difference with a man who has a lot to look atâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
