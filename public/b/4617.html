After all, you've been with a few girls I might be happy to be with."</p> <p>Breathe</p> <p>"Maybe I could help in your favor, Mr. Miller. I know some girls who think you're going to be a little bit rough."</p> <p>He's not!</p> <p>As she said it, this seemed to do the trick. When I heard his words, I realized that her comment didn't concern me at all. My mind had shifted to sex and he was right, but he wasn't doing that to me.</p> <p>He's not!</p> <p>My next words were like a slap to my head.</p> <p>I'm not!</p> <p>My mind shifted to what his words meant and I realized he was right, but it was not my intention to be doing that. I was just trying to save face, hoping that perhaps we might be able to become lovers in the future. But, I couldn't. Not now. Not ever. He was right, but what was there to make me think that after all? Besides, how had I ever gotten myself in this situation? Why had I even given myself to him?</p> <p>Just to make matters worse, he was right in front of me. I could feel him looking away with my body right next to his, but my words had the same effect on him that he had on me. Then, as I leaned over him and touched his arm with my free hand, I heard his low voice say, "You were amazing. Absolutely perfect. You're the best student."</p> <p>That was the truth. He had given me that. He still was. But, he wasn't going to let me down.</p> <p>"Bri, I know that's hard, but... you're a very special girl." I smiled at him, which caused him to make a smile. "Don't you think I'd like to do something for you again, if you would?"</p> <p>I thought about it for a moment. "I'm not sure," I said. "There is something about our connection right now that really scares me. I'm sorry you feel that way, but, I don't think I was thinking clearly today. I just..."</p> <p>I realized at that moment what I meant to say to him. That as we were walking away as close to the parking lot as we could get. I also realized that the fact that we had walked away had made me realize just how good I felt. I was feeling so close to him, my body was warm and I wanted him all over.</p> <p>He gave me one last chance, then turned his body to face me.</p> <p>I thought I was beginning to feel better. At least, that's the way he felt. He looked into my eyes and saw nothing but love there. It was beautiful to see. Then, I saw that he really wasn't falling in love with me. That he had fallen in love with some girl.</p> <p>It was very strange, but so very good to see.</p> <p>When he got close to me, we hugged each other tightly.</p> <p>"I love you." he whispered to me with a touch of sadness.</p> <p>"I love you." I whispered back.</p> <p>Then, his lips touched mine.</p> <p>I was so surprised from what I had just done, but it didn't take long to realize what exactly I had just done. I had just kissed a high school jock, who had treated me as if I were a goddess.</p> <p>But, it was the fact that we were now separated from the others that made me feel like this had some truth to it after all. It was the fact that I could feel his hard body pressed against me. It was the fact that I was kissing a young guy that was making me feel so good and wanted. And, I was actually loving it and I didn't care. I was the lucky girl who was kissing the most gorgeous guy I knew in all my high school days.</p> <p>It made me smile when my lips brushed along his.</p> <p>That would be true if I had kissed him at the moment, but not yet. In a moment, the feeling was definitely coming off my body. I wanted to taste him, to feel his skin against mine.</p> <p>"I'm sorry for what I have done, Bri." He said, and kissed me again as we started to walk away. "You didn't have to do this."</p> <p>I took this as the best compliment I had ever heard. I was feeling very good and I wanted him to be with me.</p> <p>We walked on. He told me about the dorm room and the fact that the first time he had gone there was at the beginning of the school yearâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
