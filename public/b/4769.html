It's not something I need to feel, and you just keep taking a beating, don't you?" Trish said, not wanting this to get ugly, and then she added a bit of humor.</p> <p>"Not my business, but, you know, I can't help it. It's just too fucking difficult," Tom said.</p> <p>"Don't be silly," Trish said with a smile, "it's not a problem at all. I like the way you think and your attitude doesn't make me feel bad. I've never tried to get your opinion, but sometimes, it's hard to live with in some small town. It's really not a problem."</p> <p>"What is it?" Tom said. He couldn't help himself, his dick rose with every word that was spoken.</p> <p>"I can't believe how hard it is, you know," Trish said, "I can't believe you are always so cold and calculating, like you are now. And you have me so upset,"</p> <p>"And you have me," Tom shot back. "That's exactly what I want, so why shouldn't you have me as your bodyguard?"</p> <p>"So you want to put pressure on me, so you will have to do it, isn't that true?" Trish said. "How long will you have me?"</p> <p>"You have me for about a week?" Tom asked.</p> <p>"That's right, I'm sorry, it's just that it has never been like this," Trish said. "And you don't have to do anything, even if you want to."</p> <p>"Do you want me to come and do that?" Tom said. He was feeling pretty horny. He'd never seen this side of Trish before, it was always just a bit too hot.</p> <p>"Yes," Trish said, leaning in and kissing him. "I really want you to come," she said, reaching back and rubbing her hands on top of his. She wanted him in her body, so she turned around again, and pulled his dick into her pussy, taking his whole dick in one go.</p> <p>"Oh, god, what am I missing?" Tom said. He looked at her, she was looking like she was about to cum again.</p> <p>"You know what to do," Trish said, "come, I'll work something out with you." Then she slowly started to move, sliding up and down on his dick again.</p> <p>Tom started to get close, a little while later he started cumming again, and then Trish was still coming. He was still coming, but it was nothing like the orgasm she had just given him, and even though he was still cumming and cumming, at least he knew that it was subsiding. He felt Trish slowly slide off of his cock and then she crawled up to suck his dick clean.</p> <p>"How was that?" Trish asked after he had finished filling her mouth, her head bobbing up and down a little on his shaft. "I don't feel sloppy like I thought I would," she said, as she looked up at him. "I feel a lot better, I feel like maybe some of the women you used to screw weren't that way."</p> <p>"Yeah, but it wouldn't be good, not really. I mean, you were really great. I'd love to do it again," Tom said.</p> <p>"I didn't say you should," Trish said. "Get in here," she said, grabbing his head and turning him to get their lips again.</p> <p>A year and a few days later, Tom and Trish were driving over to their mother's house and Trish said she had something for him.</p> <p>"I brought home a present from school this time," she said before they drove into the house. She put a bag on the floor in the living room, with it was a very pretty little red dress. That dress was very pretty, it was like someone else's little black dress, and it was the dress Trish wore a couple of months ago.</p> <p>Trish came out of the bathroom, and looked at Tom as she did, wearing the dress, and her hair was all done up. She also had put on a pair of really small blue shoes, and her hair was down and out of her face.</p> <p>"What is this for? I don't have any money," Trish said. "I don't normally wear a dress like that. I don't want mommy's money."</p> <p>Tom turned, "It's my present. I brought it with me too."</p> <p>Trish sat down on the bed, and Tom took his stuff and went to get the dress.</p> <p>Trish got the dress on and handed Tom an envelope, he opened it, opened it and took the envelope and read itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
