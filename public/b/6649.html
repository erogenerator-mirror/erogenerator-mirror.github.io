The last time he saw her was in the laundry room when they got back to the dorm. During one of that day's work, she was staring the place vacantly, looking only as though she was bored and bored. He knew it was a good thing, not because of the fact that she did it but because he didn't understand what it was that brought her back to earth. She was one of those rare people that didn't want to stay there much anymore, and it made him feel a little uneasy about how she was being used. The other day as he was leaving for class she was in the library. He wondered if she had taken a copy of her novel to study while he left so he hadn't seen her. He was feeling a little apprehensive about what he was doing, but he wanted to be with her, or at least watch her study instead of thinking about all the bad things that usually happened to her while he was doing things. He had no idea what to write when he was in class, and he didn't like how things were going in their current situation.</p> <p>Over the next day he didn't think too highly of himself. He had gone over some books and he had tried to focus on each one for several minutes, but they kept coming back to something he was thinking. He had written something about "Love", about her taking on this kind of role, that he would be willing to take up with a girl after class to teach her something about real love. He also wrote a note about his own relationship with Susan, explaining how it had ended. And most importantly he had told her his deepest and darkest fears.</p> <p>Before leaving for class that day Susan asked him if he would like to go to a birthday party with her that night after her final exam for the semester. She said that they had been going to go out for about three months when she asked him to be a guest, and that it seemed that he thought about it constantly. He did not answer.</p> <p>It was Friday evening, and he felt like he was about to go home before his last class of the week. He was just about to call his parents when he heard her door close. He took a deep breath and quickly thought back on the past few months. He had felt so much like a kid in his own head when he had been a kid, that it hurt so much. He had felt so foolish. It had taken him years to figure out how he was going to take on this girl he had gotten to know very well. Now here he was, after six months of living the same way. He wanted to be her friend too, to play with her and take her out to eat and to see her movies and do anything with her. It wouldn't be long before he had to decide what to say to Susan. Maybe just talk to someone else. He knew that he didn't want to feel as though he was doing something that was wrong. He didn't want to lose what he had with Susan yet.</p> <p>Susan didn't pick up on the ring the second she locked her door. She turned to him and said, "I hope you aren't going to be that difficult."</p> <p>"I'm not. Not for the money, I'm for who you are anyway." He was really going for her at this point and was not about to go too far. He couldn't even say the words, "I am falling in love with you," in his head.</p> <p>"You have."</p> <p>"You've been in love with me for seven years, and this isn't even supposed to happen. How could you?"</p> <p>"You're right. We are friends, and it has been a long time. I really wish that we were like that."</p> <p>For the first time he felt himself being torn in half. And yet, he didn't want to lose her so quickly. He could always say something and have her stay with him. That hurt more than anything else. But if she came tonight, then they could still have a good time together.</p> <p>She walked over to him and kissed him softly on the cheek. "I'm going out tonight to buy a few things, and then I'll let you know what's okay."</p> <p>He felt like he was in a daze at the moment. What could he say to help her? He wanted to tell her, but didn't want to make a long list. He knew that when he heard the sounds of a car pull into the garage from behind, that she would hear as well, and that she would be able to guess what the noise was, which it was. She didn't have to know. She just wanted him to know that something was wrong.</p> <p>"I'm glad we are having a good time. I have waited for seven years, and now I've waited for youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
