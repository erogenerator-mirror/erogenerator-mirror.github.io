I didn't stop her hand from sliding my shorts down, to free my cock.</p> <p>"But it looks so good like this," she said, pressing it against my thigh. The head, she could see it was big, my foreskin covering the head. It was hard, but it would stay that way.</p> <p>I looked down at it. How can anyone resist that I thought? I stroked it gently.</p> <p>"Just for a moment," she said, "If that's okay with you. And if it isn't," she added, waggling her eyebrows. "I think that'll make it even better!" I reached down and stroked her hair once more.</p> <p>The next morning I was up early, and headed to the bathroom, while Cathy had her shower. It was the first time since the first morning I had my shower, and had spent a good part of an hour washing between my legs. This was my first encounter with women. I decided that it was better than being alone, and that way Cathy knew that I liked touching her body. She seemed to like that too, and I spent a good bit of time teasing the head of my cock with the tip of my finger. I wanted to cum, and I didn't have to say anything to be honest as to what I wanted. I let my hand wander up and down its length a bit, letting my thumb make a circle around the head. And then I moved my finger down to her breasts, and started to play with them in a way my finger couldn't. I thought I heard a sound, but didn't care much. I decided to try and get her to cum by my fingers and the hand that was doing the stroking.</p> <p>I got myself to the point where I couldn't control what I was doing, and my hand moved a little faster on itself. The head of my cock was starting to look a bit like the head of a penis. And then I had a thought, "What if it's a penis instead of a finger?"</p> <p>I pulled my hand away from her breasts and started to kiss the back of it lightly. Her body was warm underneath me, and I found it exciting. I kissed back down from her neck to her tits, teasing the soft skin where her nipple and my hand had come together. Cathy started to get very close to cumming, which made it hard to hold on. As I moved my lips down to her chest she started to moan. As her breathing grew heavier I felt something press against the tip of my cock, then stop at that point. It was something with the shaft that looked sort of like a cock. I held on, and was now sure that it wasn't the head I had thought was there before. The skin started to slide up the shaft. The shaft that I was stroking at the time. With my hand still on her, I lifted her right breast to my face, and started to lick its fullness. As I took her nipple between my lips I slipped my hand from her nipple, and started to put a palm up on her other breast. After it was done, I moved it up to her other breast, and repeated the motions on the left.</p> <p>I could sense that she was getting close to cumming as well. I wanted her to hold it for a little longer.</p> <p>I reached up to her face and kissed it. She opened her mouth slightly to receive my tongue. Her head was moving closer to mine, and I pulled myself into her. I pressed my lips against hers and then slid my tongue into her mouth, which she accepted eagerly. We held each other for a moment, her mouth still on mine, then she released my tongue then pulled away from me again. Her lips were still attached to mine, and her tongue was now deep into my mouth, so I just continued to move my upper body along hers. Then, as we slowly wound our way out of the kiss, I put my hands down there and slid one between her legs. The lips there still parted. I moved my leg up across hers. Once our legs were tangled together, my hand moved between her legs, and I slid my hand in between both our bodies. My fingers found her wetness. And I let one of her legs drop on my cock, which now was very hard indeed.</p> <p>Cathy was moaning into my mouth and moving her hips against me without being able to control herself. She was getting close to cumming now too, and it was driving me crazy. My hand, which was wet with her slick juices, found her spot between her legsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
