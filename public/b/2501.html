So nice."</p> <p>You grab my cock and begin to rub it up and down your slit...you move your hips up and down to encourage the motion. I take my cock in hand and guide it to your opening, "Push down, my sexy wife, and you can slide it in."</p> <p>I know how to slide my way up and down your pussy. I know exactly how you want it...you want me to push into you, you want me to fuck you. It is almost always the last one, the part that only comes if you are aching for me to fill you up with my cock, and when you do that you can control the speed, or depth, and even when you are close to being done. I reach around your thighs, placing my hands on your ass, pulling you closer to me with each thrust. The wet heat of your pussy is like an electric shock, and when you are close to orgasm. You hold your breath, biting your lip...and then it happens...my cock is fully in you...and your whole body clamps down on it and you feel yourself being completely immersed in my cock.</p> <p>I stay still inside you. You reach your hand back to take my cock...it is still hard even with your fingers wrapped around it. You slide it slowly in and out of your wetness. It doesn't take long until you are at a good pace, your breath quickens as you build, and your moaning becomes louder.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck......fuck....I'm fucking cumming.....yessss...yessss.....Oh, yes, yes, ohhhhhhhh....I'm cummingggggg!" You begin to tremble and shake; you begin to moan even louder and breathe out in a long sound.</p> <p>It is a bit of a wonder what it feels like to be fucked so hard by a man not only without it happening, but also at the same time, the feeling was unreal. You begin to tremble and shake as your orgasm starts to come to fruition, and you begin to grind against me...and then you are bucking up against me. Your body is shaking and pulsating with each thrust and you scream out loud in pleasure...moans, groans, and grunts escape your lips with each spasm...and you are cumming once again...hard.</p> <p>"Oh, Oh, God, I'm cumming." I feel your pussy clamp down onto me and begin to spasm around me, pushing me back into you with each convulsion, causing a huge orgasm to go on and on. It's amazing the way your body responds to me, and the feeling of being in another woman's body. Even when you are fucking another woman, you know that I will always be inside you, always in your mouth, your pussy, and even in your ass, and even in you. You are a perfect woman for me.</p> <p>You come down completely from your orgasm, and you lay down on top of me and kiss me. Your lips are soft and your hands are stroking my side, my chest, and my hair. You start to kiss my ear, and whisper to me softly, "Thank you, that was incredible."</p> <p>I reach a hand down to cup your breasts, and then down to fondle your breasts. Your eyes are still closed and you are breathing hard. My hands begin to roam over you. You are so sexy... I can't help it. I don't want you to think that this last minute is for sex, that I may be just being nice to you when we get to know each other.</p> <p>You raise your head and look at me, your eyes still closed, "I've never, in my wildest fantasies or anything, felt this way with anyone, except a few other guys." You smile and say the only thing that comes close to being beautiful.</p> <p>"Well, it may even be possible with you... but I just can't. I want to fuck you every once in a while, just the way you like it."</p> <p>We kiss for a while. "Mmm, I haven't been fucked as long as you and Bill have. I would love to do you again after all these years." You say to me, then you kiss me.</p> <p>I reach up to cup and feel your breasts again, then we turn around on the bed. "I want to make love to you," I say softly.</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>As we stand there in each other's arms, you begin to kiss my lips, my cheeks, and my mouth. My hands run slowly up and down your legs, and as we kiss I reach up again and find your nipples, and begin to pinch them. They rise up at my touch and you open your eyes in surprise.</p> <p>"Don't."</p> <p>"Don't what, love?" You continueâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
