I wrapped my arms around her and we shared a kiss and a hug and just hung there. My cock was hard inside her and she slid against it gently.</p> <p>"Do you think we should do this again?" she asked.</p> <p>"Oh yes, we have to, again," I said.</p> <p>"It seems we have the same idea," she said. "Let's do this again."</p> <p>"Oh, god, yes!" she said.</p> <p>I moved to her back and lay on top of her. I slid my arms around her, kissed her neck, kissed her ear.</p> <p>"Do you have any idea how good this makes me feel?" she asked.</p> <p>"Do you have any idea how good it makes you feel?" I repeated.</p> <p>"Oh, god, yes," she said.</p> <p>It was getting close. I lifted her onto my cock and moved to lie on top of her. I slipped one arm under her head and used my free hand to kiss her. She wrapped her arms around me, too. We snogged like mad. Our faces were flushed, the lights in the room danced by, and just melted away in the heat of the moment.</p> <p>"Oh, my god," she said as she broke the kiss long enough to say, "You make me feel...gorgeous!"</p> <p>To my surprise, she reached one hand behind me and started to rub, and, then, started to stroke me. Our bodies were so warm, and we were both flushed. Her fingers were stroking my cock, as my fingers were reaching under her, and rubbing the top of her pussy, then slipping down toward her asshole.</p> <p>We kissed passionately as I rubbed her and she stroked my cock. My fingers made tiny flicks in her hairline as she massaged me. I was close at hand, but she didn't reach under yet. I rubbed up and down and over her clit, teasing and working her clit, while she stroked me. I felt her start to writhe on the mattress, and we both turned our faces toward one another, our eyes half in the other, looking into one another’s eyes.</p> <p>"It's okay," she said. “Let me. Let me...do it to you."</p> <p>I felt her relax further, and she put her hands on my lower abdomen. I put my hands under her, and worked a finger in. She started to stroke me lightly, and soon, I was stroking her. We were in a rhythm, moving back and forth, slowly, slowly, working into a perfect stroke. I kissed her, too, and rolled my lips over hers, tonguing her, and sucking on her lips.</p> <p>We stopped moving and just stayed connected. I still had my finger in her and I massaged her clit with it, stroking it gently. She began to move in rhythm with me. It was such a close connection between us.</p> <p>We broke the kiss and gazed into each other's eyes, moving our faces toward one another. We started kissing and breathing hard. We were kissing deeply and passionately.</p> <p>"Oh, god, my legs are shaking!" she cried. “I'm coming, I'm coming!"</p> <p>We kept kissing. I could feel the convolutions of her orgasm as we moved against each other. Her pussy was squeezing tight over my finger, and I could feel the walls of it quivering around me. We broke the kiss and stared into each other’s eyes, then kissed again and rubbed each other.</p> <p>"Oh, wow, that was incredible," I said. She had been silent as I caressed her breasts and kissed her neck. "It was pretty exciting for me too. You...you really did it."</p> <p>"So do you," she replied.</p> <p>"Well, I'm here now," I said. My arm went around her, and she took my hand and led me upstairs. We lay on the bed, watching TV, caressing each other. At some moments, I felt her fingers working on my ass, pushing me toward her. And then I felt it as it was pressing into my cock. She was stroking me, too, and it was driving me mad.</p> <p>"Uh, uh, uh," I moaned.</p> <p>"Oh, shit," she said, as she slid her finger in further, but didn't go any further. She was pulling and pushing my ass back into her finger. I could feel my cock pressing into her palm. Her hand was on the other side of her, but still didn't go any further. Her fingers were on my cock, but the pressure of her finger was still on my ass. The feeling was incredible.</p> <p>"Mmmm, it's—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
