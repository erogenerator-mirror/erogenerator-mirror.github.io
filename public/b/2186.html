That had been nearly thirty minutes! She didn't know if she could go back to that before she really had that much to lose!</p> <p>'I can't! I'm sorry, this is crazy! I can't just walk right back! I have to find her, there is no way that she's going to leave me behind' she whispered to herself. She reached out and took him by the chin, his arms wrapped around her waist as she walked with him. All the way up, she felt him trembling a little as she looked into his eyes.</p> <p>'Where did you get this? It is amazing! I haven't felt this happy since I was a child! Where did you get this?'</p> <p>He could feel himself blushing with every word of it.</p> <p>'I don't know! It looks like we're on the same track. I just bought it a few months ago and since then it's been everywhere. It is beautiful! This is even better than I could ever have dreamed! How could all the crazy and stuff I was doing on the computer get this!'</p> <p>'This way?' he replied as they walked through a doorway to another section of the building. 'This is where I found her. My girlfriend, Jennifer!' she exclaimed as all eyes were on him.</p> <p>He followed her through the doorway for a few moments until she pulled him down to the ground at the end of the stairway.</p> <p>'Jennifer, my love. I love you.'</p> <p>'I love you too!' she said back as she wrapped her arms around him. Together they walked back to the room and out of their thoughts.</p> <p>When she got up on her knees and crawled into the room, she saw that she had found her roommate, Michelle. She knew she would have to talk to her when she got back before she lost her mind.</p> <p>The walk back upstairs was even more uneventful than when they got in the car. She knew Michelle had been gone from the office and she assumed she hadn't gone home. She was pretty sure she wasn't going to talk with Jennifer!</p> <p>She could tell by the look on Michelle's face how she felt as she had found out what she thought and why from her. She decided it was time to make her decision. After a brief hesitation, she pulled the shirt off and threw it on the chair beside her. She took the hem of her shirt and raised it up her body showing off her bare breasts.</p> <p>Michelle didn't know what to do but was unable to look away. This was the most beautiful woman she knew. She wasn't sure of what to do but knew it was best that way. She could always move on and find another girlfriend.</p> <p>She knew now that it was time to tell her. She pulled the shirt down over her breasts and dropped it on the chair too. She knew Michelle was already sitting there and she wasn't worried about anything else.</p> <p>'I feel better now. I think today could bring us closer,' she told herself as she pulled her shirt back over her body. She looked at the clock, it was almost midnight. 'I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say anything; I just wanted someone to talk to so I could tell her something. I know how important she is to me. It's just not fair!'</p> <p>She walked over to her desk and laid down so she was on her side laying straight with her free arm tucked behind her. She didn't bother to look at the clock, instead she just concentrated on where she was. She could feel herself getting excited to go back to the store this time. She wanted to see something so badly, but she couldn't. The clock was almost seven hours. Then she started to feel her body tingle all over.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>As much as she wanted to go back, it just wouldn't do anything for now. She couldn't be upset about it now and that was the reason why it was so important. She just didn't know what was going to happen. But it wasn't worth going back to her empty house and going back to being the same man who she had been talking to online.</p> <p>She knew better than to think of that, but if the things she had said were true she just couldn't. For the thousandth time since she had been able to find out how she would react to them, she had thought about it; thought about the conversation, thought about the friendship she had talked to, thought about whether she could tell Michelle about them all together without knowing her.</p> <p>Maybe if she just had her mind fixed, she wouldn't feel so guilty. She wasn't sure if she could handle it but she knew. She had already made up her mind and she was willing to give it to herself.
