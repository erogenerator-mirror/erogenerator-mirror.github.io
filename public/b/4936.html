She stopped at the first step and turned. "I want to spend the weekend in your bed!" She turned around and leaned against the wall. "Would you like to fuck?" She asked as she lifted her hand.</p> <p>"Oh yeah!" He said and he quickly moved over to her. Then his hands quickly returned to her tits. He started rubbing them with his hands. "You always get me turned on." he said with a grin. He slowly pulled on and twisted her nipples. The feeling was electric. She let go of her breasts and pressed her chest into his hands. He pulled on them a little and she let go of them as she squeezed his stiff cock through his pants. He looked at her face and then back down at her breasts. She looked so sexy that it was making him even hornier. He started unbuttoning her blouse as she leaned against the wall. She opened it up slightly and let it slide off her arms. She reached out and took the top part off in one motion and he pulled his shirt in to help her remove it on. Then he did the same for his own. She turned and stood back up. She let his shirt slide off and then sat down on the bed. He stood with his shirt in one hand as he kicked his pants off. Then he took the panties from the floor and helped her step out of them. His cock was now rock hard and stood straight up as he took her hand and lead her up the stairs. He took a step forward and pulled her to him. Then he was on her and they kissed deeply. She reached up to play with the buttons and felt him through his pants. He kissed her neck as his hands moved down to rub at her breasts. She let out a deep sigh as the feeling of his hands moved over her body. They moved down to her hips. He reached for the snap to her pants and unzipped them. She took his hand and helped him take them off while he still played with her breasts. He slowly slid the pants down her legs as she kicked the pants off over the bed. He bent down and kissed her on the lips. "Let's go." he said as he pulled her toward the door. He kissed her on the corner before he went in back to open it and turned on the light. He looked at her as he opened the door and held her inside. "Are you ok?" he asked as the door closed after he stepped out.</p> <p>"Yes, I'm fine. I'm ready to get fucked." she said as she turned to go into the bedroom. The lights were on and they were still inside together.</p> <p>"I think I'm ready to fuck now." he said without any hesitation in his voice now.</p> <p>"I'm ready too." she said in a lusty voice.</p> <p>He pushed her back on to the bed and then lay down next to her. She looked at him expectantly and smiled. "Are you sure?" he asked. She nodded and moved to straddle him. "Are you sure?" he asked as she straddled him facing him. "I'm on top so you can fuck me." she said as she started working her panties off.</p> <p>"Oh really?" he said and reached for her waist.</p> <p>"I'm on you." she said and then worked the panties off of her. She stood up and moved to where he was sitting on the edge of the bed. He reached up and pulled her down into his arms. She kissed him as she reached her hands down to unbutton his pants. She undid them and pulled them off as his cock bounced out at her. She looked up at his face as his cock came into her field of vision. She lowered her head. She took his cock into her mouth. He moaned as her wet lips closed around him. She started taking him deep as she was moving to the rhythm of her head, she took him deeper into her mouth, but just a little as she started to feel his cock moving against the back of her throat. She stopped and looked up at him. "You like it when I do that don't you?" she asked in a sexy voice.</p> <p>"Oh yeah! You're beautiful."</p> <p>She smiled and pushed him down on the bed. She straddled his chest and then she lowered herself to his face. "Suck me." she said as she put her leg over his head.</p> <p>He gently opened her lips with his tongue. He slid his tongue slowly out, sliding over all the areas, then back into her. He started moving his tongue slowly faster over her and when he reached her clit he flicked his tongue all over it. Then he sucked it in and sucked until she came. When she looked down at him she could see wet juices all overâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
