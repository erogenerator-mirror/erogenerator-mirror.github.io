He saw the woman from the bar had followed him. She walked slowly towards him where the woman stood in one corner and the man who helped her stood by the bar. When Megan stopped in front of the man and bent to talk to him the man's eyes locked onto her tits and they quickly turned back to her chest. Megan could already feel herself getting wet in spite of how wet she was. The man's voice in her ear reminded her she was his partner. The sound of his voice brought forth a sense of power.</p> <p>"Hello?"</p> <p>"Um, hi Steve, how are you?" Megan asked as if she was addressing him personally.</p> <p>"I'm fine. I've been expecting you. I'm Steve from outside. I'm not sure you know me."</p> <p>"Oh that's not possible. You could be the manager."</p> <p>"Yes they let customers to do it without asking questions first," Steve said. "You can tell me your story, just relax."</p> <p>Steve's words hit Megan like a punch to the face. She immediately responded by leaning in towards him. Steve wrapped his arms around her waist and they moved closer together. His cock was hard against her belly and she could feel his erection. He put his hands on her hips and pulled her closer to him. Megan reached behind her to his stiff cock. They had only touched once or so before, but they felt right, there was no stopping now. This time he was going to fuck her.</p> <p>Megan leaned back to let him kiss her. They kissed passionately as Steve slid his hands up and cupped her tits. Megan's nipples were hard and she was glad he hadn't touched her nipples earlier. When he had a nipple between his fingers she moaned softly and leaned into his kiss. Her hand began to move up and down his cock as he did this. Their tongues danced and pressed against each other. Steve's hands cupped her buttocks and pulled them a little closer to his groin. Megan's hand moved up to the front of Steve's pants and undid them. At first he thought she was playing with his cock and then as her hand moved beneath her panties he realized the object of her desires was there.</p> <p>She guided his cock into her with one hand and grabbed her tits with the other. She moaned into his kiss as the head of his cock pushed up her cunt. Without thinking or caring, and with no warning, Megan slipped his cock into her pussy. His thrusting made Megan arch against him and she could feel a strong need building in her. Soon Steve's thrusts became frenzied. Their lust filled groans, their kissing and the sensations they were both having built up between them. They thrust against each other in a synchronized movement. They were oblivious to anything else but each other and the pleasures they were experiencing. Megan's mouth pressed tight against Steve's as she came. Her moans reverberating around the club and around him.</p> <p>They paused on the other side of a table for a moment as their bodies calmed down. Megan pulled Steve's hand off her tits and slid it down between her legs. Her hands ran over her skin, over her mound. When Steve's finger slipped between her lips Megan's juices had been running down his wrist. Steve's mouth lowered over hers and his tongue filled her mouth with passion. The passion ignited the kiss and they explored each other as if they had never done anything before. Steve put one arm around Megan's back and they continued to run their hands over each other when they were interrupted by another man passing by the room.</p> <p>"This is one lucky bastard getting one of your guys to let a guy fuck you," a familiar name said from above them.</p> <p>Cate was sitting up watching. Her friend, Beth, had joined in from the other end of the room.</p> <p>"I don't know about you two but I'm not so sure this is going to work out. This is going to be a long night. I have no intention of fucking you guys just yet. It's going to be fun."</p> <p>"Megan, Steve."</p> <p>"Who?" Cate asked.</p> <p>"Megan," Megan responded.</p> <p>"Megan!" Beth screamed loudly and her voice was muffled.</p> <p>"Megan!" Megan called out again.</p> <p>"Megan!" Beth yelled from upstairs.</p> <p>When Steve pulled Cate off by the hand her friend started to leave the room. When Steve asked where she went she just told him to wait. Steve turned to Cate and saw his new partner. She was a stunning brown-haired redhead and Steve could easily see between Cateâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
