"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come, but I couldn't stop."</p> <p>"No, you shouldn't stop," Elsie said emphatically, wrapping her arms about his neck and hugging tightly. "They were just so...ohh. So beautiful. They look so nice. And you're so tall and slim; they're the most beautiful pair I've ever seen."</p> <p>"Thank you," Daniel said.</p> <p>"No, it's nothing," Elsie said, smiling brightly. "You're absolutely breathtaking."</p> <p>"Well I have to say they're very sexy, too," Daniel said, leaning in and kissing her.</p> <p>"Mmmm. I feel so happy we have this in common."</p> <p>"Me too," Daniel replied. "I'm going to need to see these beautiful things for dinner."</p> <p>"Maybe you'll catch something good on TV," Elsie said, pulling away from him and walking into his bathroom. Daniel sat on the bed, his back facing the mirror. He admired the curve of his pale cheeks in the mirror and the lines of his back. He pulled off his shirt and dropped it on the chair next to him. He kicked off his shoes and undid his belt, then slowly unbuttoned his pants, sliding them down past his butt, then bending his knees and kicking them off the bed. He took off his panties and folded them into a neat package with the socks. He pulled the box up to the bed and held it up with his right hand, staring at herself in the mirror. The image from the bathroom came through in his mind: the soft blue panties, the pink lingerie that she'd taken off to reveal her round butt, the thin, pink bra, and the dark blue socks in that order, and the pink socks that he had already seen before. He couldn't believe he'd done it. He pulled off his socks and stood up, putting the box on the night stand by the computer, then walked over to the bed.</p> <p>"Don't put your shirt back on," she said.</p> <p>"Of course not."</p> <p>When he sat on the bed next to her, he said,</p> <p>"I can't believe I'm doing this."</p> <p>"I don't say that," she laughed. "I love you."</p> <p>Daniel paused at the sound of her declaration. He took a deep breath and said,</p> <p>"Yes, I like it.</p> <p>"Okay, so it's not what I think."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm doing this because I love you."</p> <p>She laughed again. "I know about that one."</p> <p>"Sorry. I'm sorry."</p> <p>"Don't be," she said, shaking her head. "Just think about it. Can I talk to you about it later?"</p> <p>"Sure, I guess," he said, turning to sit next to her.</p> <p>When he turned around, she said, "Can you watch me?"</p> <p>"Oh, I guess I can."</p> <p>"I like to watch people. I like to watch them. Do you do that any time I'm with a friend?"</p> <p>"No, I don't."</p> <p>"Good. I'm not just going to be here all day. And you won't be watching me at all during dinner if that's okay. Do you want me to put on some of that lingerie?"</p> <p>Daniel smiled.</p> <p>"That's okay," he said, taking the shirt off on the bed and dropping it on the dirty floor. "If it's nothing else, fine. If it's what I think, fine. If it's what you think I should want," he said, putting on the red underwear she'd brought over with her at work.</p> <p>"Well, thanks for the coffee," she said, turning her back to him. "It's good to see you again."</p> <p>"Likewise," Daniel said. "It's good to be here."</p> <p>He smiled at her again. She was perfect in every way. Of course the thought of it wouldn't have worked out very well if Daniel had seen the ad for "lots" or if it hadn't been one of the more risqué magazines he went looking for.</p> <p>But Elsie was a good judge of character. After just a couple of days, Daniel found that the time had taken its toll. She wasn't as shy as he'd expected. She was as easy going as the first few days in his apartment had been. She was witty and charming and engaging, and she didn't seem that concerned about Daniel's feelings for her. As he thought about it, he thought he might—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
