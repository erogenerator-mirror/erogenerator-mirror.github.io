I exclaimed when I found out she had a new boyfriend who would be just as kind to have the next day. She giggled to herself as we kissed.</p> <p>I had never liked the idea of having sex with anyone but her. I was attracted to girls and would not let that happen to me. I had never actually been able to have sex with a girl but had only read what I thought was a lot of porn on the internet. Her body, her perfume, her sweet smile. And her tits, and her perfect, large, dark areolae. But what really got me was the way she would move her hips when we fucked. That sexy, teasing way that seemed so familiar.</p> <p>He started to feel under her dress on the outside, feeling how thin isolae were on her body. His cock had been swelling even further ever since I touched her and she was getting used to the feel of it now. I had to touch it.</p> <p>'You like?' I asked, and her face dropped. She was stunned at my brazenness. If I kept this up all night I would have a permanent hard on. She knew that and I was pleased. My hand had not yet left her body and my fingers moved toward her face as I leaned closer.</p> <p>I moved my hand to the side of her face, feeling her face, her lips, and her eyelids. She looked back into my eyes, my hand moving toward hers even faster. I saw that smile again.</p> <p>His hand was moving higher and higher on the front of her body. Just to see her reaction to my touch was a massive turn on. My fingertips had gotten close to the top button of her dress now, which had risen and exposed her breasts. Her face was now flush, and she seemed to like how his fingers moved up and down, touching where I wasn't touching her. I kissed the top of her face and watched his fingers move between her breasts. My hands continued exploring her body and she started to moan just as I did.</p> <p>'Oh, God, yes,' she mumbled as I looked over her shoulder at him. She was looking down into his eyes with a look that said, "are you sure you're willing?" She was. I had been the one initiating, leading, and then controlling. He was a big part of what we were both about to do.</p> <p>His fingers slid down a little deeper now, moving on her chest. I turned her around so he could get a better view. She was on her back now, her face turned toward me with a smile on. Her eyes opened and she smiled.</p> <p>'How are you?' I asked, but with more confidence.</p> <p>'Good,' she said, as he kissed her again. He didn't waste any time. His fingers slipped inside her panties and it was easy to find her lips and I let one finger move to start stroking it between them.</p> <p>'I want to watch you with another guy.' She turned around until he sat on the couch next to her.</p> <p>'Why does he want to do that?' he asked.</p> <p>'Is he a big guy or what? He is.' I said.</p> <p>I moved my hand under her dress and felt her cunt beneath...my finger had found her clit and started playing again, feeling how wet she got as I did. She pushed her tongue into my mouth as he started to rub his crotch against her.</p> <p>'God, you are going to make me come,' she said. Her words were turning me on. I moved my other hand down and felt that tight wet slit, wet and ready for me.</p> <p>He put both hands over her mouth as he kissed her, pushing her back on her back. Her head was resting on his shoulder with him lying between her legs. I lifted her left leg off the couch so he could slide his hand inside her panties. He moved his other hand in the opposite direction, and I used the finger on her clit to rub the top and bottom, spreading the moisture on both sides.</p> <p>"Oh..." my bride moaned. Her body shivered from the sensations in both our hands and I continued rubbing, feeling her excitement in the contact. She was breathing hard for about a minute. I was trying to memorize the texture and feel of her body.</p> <p>"Is it you?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yesss..." she whispered.</p> <p>Her eyes were closed. He moved down and kissed her inner thigh right next to her cunt. Her whole body shivered. She opened her eyes and looked down at her hand holding my penis. She smiled at me. Then her eyes opened wide.</p> <p>'Are you okay?' she asked.</p> <p>'Yes, yes. I'm fineâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
