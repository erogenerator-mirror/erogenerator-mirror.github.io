I asked, still grinning at the memory of how she fucked him and how she had come to her knees in the middle of the floor and started sucking his cock like she wanted to be the best cock sucker in the world.</p> <p>"Oh yes! I'm the best cock sucker in the world!" She grinned again and we did, again and again for the rest of the summer and spring. And the more we talked the more I got to know my wife.</p> <p>When I called her a few days later, she agreed that it was time in law class in May. At first it seemed like a spur of the moment thing to me, like she was going to tell me, but after a couple weeks she gave me this big smile and said,</p> <p>"Oh Joe, you're coming to see me, aren't you?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yep, what can I do for you Sue?" I said, "I'll be there right now."</p> <p>After hanging up with her I walked over to her car. I got in, and she got in with me. What, my mind reeled. Was this really the start of a long, relationship?</p> <p>"I like the way you think about me, Joe," she said as she moved close to me.</p> <p>She took my hand and we walked towards the stairs. I looked at her and kissed her and said,</p> <p>"You're beautiful."</p> <p>She smiled as we both laughed and said,</p> <p>"That was nice."</p> <p>We walked up the steps and I stopped her by bending down and reaching around her to feel her breasts. It was a little different to feel her up from the back like this, but good. She wasn't mad. I could have cared less. What I was doing was right so long ago and now it seemed like rightness to me. We laughed and made love right there on her front porch. She felt so good. When we broke it, she looked at me and smiled. We hugged like two old friends. I kissed her on the cheek and she kissed me hard on the lips again and said,</p> <p>"I wanted you so much."</p> <p>I felt the warmth of her body on mine and her arms around me. I felt her hand stroking my cock which was still hard and as hard as it had ever gotten. It had been a couple months since we had last made love. I felt so proud of her. It was as hard as I could get. I wanted to get it into her. I had to get inside of her. I lifted her up and carried her to the bed where I lay her down on the bed. I kissed her and caressed her. She spread her legs so I could enter her. It felt so good that I didn't think about it again but I would just say anything at this point to try and get it inside of her. I wanted it to be as good as it could be.</p> <p>"Oh Joe, please, put it in." She said.</p> <p>I slowly worked into her and it felt good. I began a slow, long, stroke and found that my cock was still hard.</p> <p>"Mmmm....fuck me..." She groaned.</p> <p>I began to move my cock in and out of her feeling that familiar familiar feeling of building pleasure. I loved the feel of her body. Her breasts rubbed my chest as we made love. I ran my hands all over her. I was so excited. I began to move faster and faster. I could feel the sensation building up and getting stronger. I closed my eyes and tried to hold on until I would cum. When her body finally began to shake and I felt her own orgasm approaching I knew it was going to be much stronger than mine.</p> <p>"Oh, Joe, yes!" I heard her say.</p> <p>I felt her body shaking and felt the warmth of her on me again. I pushed harder and she felt mine coming.</p> <p>"I'm coming!" She said. We screamed the word from our body's synapses.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Sue and I made love again that night after I had had a few beers in the front yard of her parent's house. She was wearing the same tank top and some loose, loose fitting shorts I had worn the previous night. I had brought condoms with me. As soon as we got into bed I rolled her down so I could suck her nipples so she could feel what I had just done. She was looking at me as I licked and kissed her all over.</p> <p>"Do you want me to go first?" I asked her.</p> <p>"No. Do your thing," she said as she took my hand and guided it inside of her.</p> <p>I held her and began toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
