My cock was rigid on its full length.</p> <p>"Do you enjoy your fucking?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes," she answered. I leaned forward and rubbed the end of my cock up and down her swollen pussy opening. She was wet. She had shaved. I pushed in.</p> <p>"Mmmm," she moaned. That's a good girl. Now fuck me!"</p> <p>I pulled back, then slid into her again. I pumped in and out, my cock swelling and getting ever harder. As I started to get a rhythm going, I noticed her hand holding her pussy open. I slid right back into her and felt her whole body start to move. Her pussy was so warm and wet. I slid in and out with a few deep thrusts and felt her moving up towards me. It was as if her hand had been held on in an iron grip. She grabbed me with her other hand and held onto my ass cheeks. I felt her pussy tightening around my cock as it shot into her. I reached one hand between her legs and rubbed her pussy. I started thrusting so fast. She was really fucking me back. She was moving in counterpoint to everything I was doing. I lost myself in the feeling of her pussy as her body got tighter and tighter around me. She was moving up and down very quickly, but she didn't stop. What surprised me is just how close she was to me.</p> <p>"Keep fucking me!" she almost screamed.</p> <p>She started shaking, throwing her head back. I felt her pussy begin to move on me. She was shaking uncontrollably with her orgasm. I felt her entire body start to quake. This was as close to how I had envisioned it before that my wife came to me and said I could do anything I wanted. She was shaking so hard her tits were bouncing all over her body as I felt every muscle in my body tensing up. I could hold out if I wanted. I did. But she pulled me in closer. That put me deep in her and I started to shoot into her. She felt me spurting into her as I came so hard, her pussy started cumming as well. It was the best feeling of all. I was shaking as she held me in her arms. Neither of us was stopping. We kept on fucking, my cock still shooting into her pussy, her pussy getting to feel every last drop of cum just as it had all evening.</p> <p>As I was pulling out of her, I couldn't help but feel that I felt just a lot more intense than I had before. But this was still one more intense experience! I was trying to catch my breath as we collapsed on the bed. I felt her body lay down next to me. She kissed my cheek.</p> <p>"That was incredible," she whispered. But it wasn't more of the intensity of what I'd just felt. This was something far more intense and intimate than the sex we'd just had.</p> <p>I just laid next to her and just stared into her face. I don't understand why we were getting this far, but I sure felt like I owed it to her for being so nice. "So, is there any reason we cannot do what you just told us?" I asked.</p> <p>"What I just did would be so wrong that it is too bad. I'm sure there are things you could have done to us we don't like." She said with a smile. Now that she had told us a little more, I'm not surprised at all. In all of our twenty plus years together, we have never been wrong or anything like this. "Well, you're definitely right. We are just going to think of something else. I think we just need to practice a little more in future."</p> <p>She kissed my cheek again. "But, we don't want to do anything to hurt our marriage. I've never been in a situation like this before either. I guess I can trust you both."</p> <p>"We love you," I said as I kissed her cheek again. "And, it'll mean more to you than anything. I can't just fall in love with that stupid little whoreâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
