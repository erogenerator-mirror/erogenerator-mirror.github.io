Did they do anything, you know, just fuck them?"</p> <p>"They didn't!"</p> <p>"No, but fucking them felt really good. And I like it!"</p> <p>He did know that she had liked it, especially since this one seemed that she had started getting turned on by fucking him. I didn't know that it actually made me excited. I mean, who's to know?</p> <p>"How can you say that to me as if this is happening? If you didn't like it...?"</p> <p>"But that was like...I mean, I'm not sure..."</p> <p>"That the idea turns you on, even if I don't know it. But you like it, right? You feel it? Are you excited about it?"</p> <p>"Yes," she said.</p> <p>And of course I knew that he wasn't. But if I hadn't known he could turn me on like I was turned on by the idea of his tight little pussy fucking my face, I probably wouldn't have had a clue.</p> <p>"Yes," I said. And with that I leaned down and ran my tongue over her nipple, just once, as a sign of how excited I had become. I could sense her body shaking. And he continued to suck her nipples for a bit...her tits were now as hard as mine were and he alternated back and forth between them.</p> <p>"Oh God, I've got too much to drink. I'm going to have to have another drink," she said.</p> <p>With that she got up, took him by his shoulders by the shoulders and said, "So can we go upstairs to something more comfortable?"</p> <p>"Yes," he said, "I can't resist."</p> <p>She put on a cute little dance-suit that she had borrowed, and they went upstairs. I think she was just in the mood for a change of dress. She didn't try to stuff him.</p> <p>They had a nice king-size bed, and her boyfriend was sitting up and watching me, but I could see his eyes moving from my face down to her. She slowly peeled off her clothes and he reached out to take her ass in his hands. It was smooth, I could tell. It was toned, and the skin was flawless. It was so soft that it brought me to my knees almost instantly.</p> <p>She was the same way she got when she was ready to get fucked. I know it was kind of like an experience for me at first, but the way I felt after that first experience? She was so gorgeous, not just my ideal woman, but actually a sexy girl. And this time, she was about to have sex with him. And she didn't even seem too excited. She was nervous.</p> <p>"It's been long!" she said.</p> <p>"Too long," I joked, "Not too long, huh?"</p> <p>I really meant it. It was not my idea. I was just going to do it.</p> <p>I took his hard cock in my hands and started slowly stroking, trying to make him lose his control. I felt him get bigger, starting to grow. I knew that it was going to be hard to go down on him, but I was willing to try to do what her.</p> <p>I moved my head down and kissed him again, a bit hungrily as my tongue found his. In his excitement, he quickly moved down to begin licking her pussy. And with a bit more pressure, his tongue slid from the bottom to the top, and from there, he started working her up really fast. Her pussy lips were really juicy for my mouth, and as he continued licking her, she was getting a real good rhythm going. I wasn't going to move to fast in this moment, so I just kept going. He kept licking her, and I felt her body go up and down. Then she just sat on him for a bit, and slowly she started to push back. It seemed that she was almost ready to cum, and he started moving his tongue in time with her. They were kissing and rubbing and he was still hard, so I felt her start to come a second time.</p> <p>"Ohhh, fuck," she whispered before I could respond. She moved back a bit, then leaned forward and kissed him again. I was shocked. I had imagined that we were having sex, but I thought that he had already come, but I was pretty sure, because of the way he was moving, he must have been really excited. Her body was really hot, and so tight. I thought she would probably be the one cumming. I thought she would be too, probably would explode too soon, and just like that, I lost my own control again, and started sucking her nipples and biting her neck.
