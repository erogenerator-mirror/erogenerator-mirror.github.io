He wanted her to see the excitement in my eyes.</p> <p>"You better make me proud this time."</p> <p>She moved on top of him. He had a perfect view of her round belly, the curve and the swell of her boobs.</p> <p>She kissed him.</p> <p>"Now, show me that you still love me, and make it hurt."</p> <p>He looked up, startled. He didn't know what to do.</p> <p>"Let's go."</p> <p>"You can stay in the tub again," he said.</p> <p>She smiled.</p> <p>"You have been so nice."</p> <p>"But I need to make you feel really good again."</p> <p>He started getting into the tub with her. His cock was getting hard again. The water still had a strong sheen of precum on it. He was about to do everything for her again. She made him lie down on his back. She lay down next to him and spread her legs. Her hair had fallen completely off her shoulders. He looked up at her boobs, but he could see her face.</p> <p>"You're going to be all right, aren't you?"</p> <p>She was moving her mouth over his cock, running it up and down while her hair fell back. She looked so sexy. Her breasts were moving, and swinging. He got a big surprise. Their skin was shiny, as it hung down with the rain and the hot water. They were so soft.</p> <p>"I can hardly wait until next spring. Are you getting a haircut?"</p> <p>"We're getting one, now," he lied, looking at the new, fresh, gorgeous hair.</p> <p>She took him in her hand. Her nipples were swollen and erect, the tingly feeling making him want to reach and touch them. His body was shaking. He felt his balls tighten up. He took her breast into his hand and squeezed. "I'm going to cum soon," he whispered.</p> <p>"Cum in me."</p> <p>"I want to. I want to feel you cum inside me."</p> <p>"I'm not getting off."</p> <p>"Do your thing. Fill me up with all you've got."</p> <p>She moved on his cock, taking it completely into her wet hole, his head pushing up against her g spot. He felt her cunt walls tighten up for some time. It was like she was trying to keep it inside even though her body wanted to. She lifted herself slightly, allowing him to run it up and down her clitoris while her body twiddled with pleasure. She slowly moved her hand to his balls and slowly pulled on them, squeezing his balls with her fingers. She closed her eyes and let her body be touched by his fingers, and his hands. A moan escaped from her lips while he had his way with her. She grabbed his prick and tried to pull it out of the water with her hand. He couldn't hold back his movements. He looked up at her. She looked back at him. She looked back to his cock and got down there on him. She looked into his eyes. He just had an unbridled, primal expression. And she loved it.</p> <p>It was time for him to take over again. He moved her hand to his cock to make her touch it without his hands.</p> <p>"Now you get a really good orgasm too," he said with a smile.</p> <p>She looked down at his cock. It had gotten hard again. She didn't know it, but she liked this.</p> <p>"Can I put my breasts in your mouth and kiss you?"</p> <p>"God, yes."</p> <p>"Are you ready for it?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Take off my dress."</p> <p>He had her lie on the floor. She moved to the edge of the tub.</p> <p>"Don't move, no matter what happens. Take a little breather."</p> <p>Her dress hung from her body, her head on a pile of pillows that were made of cushions. He took his pants off and sat down, with his dick in his hand, thinking about her naked body next to him from head to toe.</p> <p>"What are you doing?"</p> <p>"Your turn to be your self."</p> <p>She smiled at him as he turned and got on his hands and knees. He moved his head to her pussy, putting that long, hard, pink cock into her wet hole right on her clit. He moved back and forth. She closed her eyes and held his head in her lap while she had her own pleasure. He was going slow; almost like he hoped, not to bring her to climax, but to tease her, to make her want more and more.</p> <p>She opened her eyes.
