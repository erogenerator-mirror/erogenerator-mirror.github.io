The door of the bedroom was ajar and she slowly got back into bed. She spread her legs and pulled her panties down so it was easier to pull them off. She tossed them on the floor and crawled back toward David's room. She grabbed his crotch to stroke his cock and gave it some slow strokes. As she felt his cock get harder she put it to her mouth and blew him a kiss before climbing in beside him. He kissed her again and then whispered to her that he was going to take her.</p> <p></p> <p>As Lori sucked him she said, "I was afraid that you would take too much of my body to fit in your cock, but I really enjoyed it."</p> <p>David laughed and whispered, "If only we'd tried before."</p> <p>"I know," she replied as she stroked him lightly.</p> <p>They made love that night, with David fucking her a dozen times before he came in her. Lori could hear David's sounds as he came and she loved that, as well. She sucked him until he was soft enough to keep going. She rolled over to face him and they kissed for a moment before she got off the bed and dressed. She kissed him goodbye then he turned on his side to watch her drive away before she left.</p> <p>The drive to the restaurant was long and if Lori ever did feel the need to go back upstairs, she had the key to David's room so she said, "Just drive down to your place and see if this will work." She left David's truck in her car and headed down the street. David's car was parked across the street from the house that was being renovated and there was an alleyway leading to it. She parked, turned off the car and walked into the house as he knocked on the door. It opened and she found both John and Michael on the couch watching TV. "How long have I been out?" she asked as she led the way.</p> <p>Michael looked at Lori as she sat down next to him on the couch and said, "I was just checking out."</p> <p></p> <p>John told her that it looked like he and John had gone out to the mall. As they talked David stopped Lori's car. "Why don't we go in and change? We'll go up to your room first and I'll see if we can do an icebreaker."</p> <p></p> <p>After they got changed they sat in one of the back bedrooms. John and Michael told Lori about their relationship and how they had grown close over the last several years. Lori told them that she had been in love with Michael for over twenty years and that Michael had been in love with Michael for twenty years. It was a great relationship although it was more intimate with John and Michael than Lori and John. "Don't worry," Michael said "If we can convince our mother that she should go to that bar she is having a great time, you can go to the clubs you like, go back to your regular life." He smiled as he said it. "The only thing that we're having will be with you."</p> <p>"Oh, that would be great," Lori said as she hugged John.</p> <p>"Don't forget to pick up the key when you get back to your car," Michael said, nodding at Lace's car. "We'd better get our stuff here and find out why you're here." Lori felt good and she knew that she wasn't mad about their relationship but knew that she wouldn't let John or Michael take her away again. She was the better person now that she was having a change of heart. She didn't want either of them to suffer in the ensuing marriage but it would be hard for them to get through if they didn't keep getting together.</p> <p>She followed Michael into the car and they headed out before he made a turn onto a side road that would take them into a suburb. The road was empty except for him and Lori and John's car. As they parked at the end of the street Michael turned to Lori and said, "Lori and John don't have to stay in your car. I didn't need any explanation and they're welcome to come around for a few minutes if they like." Lori nodded.</p> <p>Lori took a look at John. "I just knew that she would. I told you when I took her upstairs that this is only the second time I have been in the room." She looked at Michael who had the look of a puppy which Lori thought that she noticed too. John's hair was a little tussled and he had gray stubble but he was clean shaven with just a little patch of hair just below his ear. His skin was tanned and had a very attractive glow to it. He was an attractive guyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
