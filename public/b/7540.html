If they had a bit of sag I'd think you were gay or something. I guess most people think bigger. And now I'm looking at your ass. Now look how it bounces with your breathing, the bulge in your shorts, the roundness of your waist," he said as he grabbed my ass. I turned around and he pulled me back to him.</p> <p>I didn't want to turn away now as I felt his hands roaming over my ass, which was round and firm, just like his cock, as he squeezed my cheeks. I turned my head to his and we kissed deeply as we both turned towards the back of my SUV. It really felt awkward though.</p> <p>Steve had opened the door and turned it on us as I started to unbutton his shirt, and as soon as I started to pull it down he kicked his shorts off.</p> <p>I pulled his cock from his boxers and gave it a squeeze as I ran my hands up and down the length of his shaft. I started to get a grip on him when his cell rang.</p> <p>"Oh shit, I'm sorry, I've been so distracted. The caller said something about a dinner engagement."</p> <p>Steve was a total mess down there.</p> <p>I sat him on our sofa, got on my knees and straddled him. I rubbed the head of his cock against my pussy lips before rubbing the cockhead around my clit, moaning slightly.</p> <p>He reached around and pulled my nipples with his thumbs as I sank down. I felt his tongue on the top of my mound before he dove in and made some other noises.</p> <p>"Steve, I think you're getting good at licking me," I said as I pushed off him with his hands, and he quickly went back to work on me.</p> <p>His tongue never missed a beat as it went up and down my slit before entering my throbbing pussy hole to lick at my clit.</p> <p>I tried to move back a bit so he could put his cock back in me before fucking me, but that wasn't going to work with his boxers and I soon found myself being fucked with a long slow, strong rod that had just had plenty of action.</p> <p>I couldn't control my breathing at the sensations of Steve's tongue in my pussy and his cock up my asshole. He took that as a hint and continued to tongue fuck me while I slid up and down his shaft on the couch. I felt like I was getting fucked for the hundredth time already, but I couldn't help it. I thought it might be some great sex after all, but with Steve in me, it would be incredible.</p> <p>Somewhere along the line I fell into a state of bliss that lasted for a couple of minutes as he used more of his tongue, and the thought that one of his buddies wouldn't stop by to watch me and take me to a place I'd never been.</p> <p>Before I knew it I was cumming and it wasn't as hard as I figured I might have thought. Steve had just kept fucking me with his tongue and then pulled out.</p> <p>"Damn Steve, I didn't know it would feel like that. I think it was just about time you came in."</p> <p>"I could say the same thing. I'm really sorry," he said as he sat next to me. I couldn't believe what he just said.</p> <p>I took a chance and reached over to him and kissed him. It was a bit different than our previous times, but it wasn't exactly bad and no strings attached and I felt him get his tongue back to work on mine.</p> <p>Steve put his arm around my shoulders and leaned back against the chair. I reached down and rubbed his cock where it had just been, then wrapped my fingers around his shaft and stroked it gently. I was feeling very sexy, and the idea of letting him feel my pussy as it had been fucked by his tongue brought all my inhibitions back. It kind of felt like being with a couple.</p> <p>When he sat up and reached for my robe, he took it off and we got in the bed and made love again. For the next five or so times I got him naked and on his side, then when we went out for lunch or dinner I was going to make sure to wear a shirt and pants because I didn't want anyone to know what I was doing. Once things were going well I'd take off my shirt while we went out.</p> <p>In addition to being my best friend Steve and I like to go to the beach every day, so I figured this wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
