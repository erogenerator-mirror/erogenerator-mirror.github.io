The image in my mind was almost hypnotic, I had to see, I had to see it, I had to have it, I needed to feel it.</p> <p>Then it happened; she turned around to me, her arms went around me but she didn't move, just looked at me with a look of fear and excitement.</p> <p>"Do you have an erection?" she asked me. I didn't even know how to answer that question.</p> <p>"No," I said, "I don't have an erection."</p> <p>"Don't worry," she said, and then she slowly turned, put to feet and looked at me as she lowered a hand to her pussy where she slid two fingers very gently inside herself. One of the things I was thinking when I walked in on you at that time, you know that two people do that together? That's what I found myself doing as I turned and looked at her.</p> <p>She was looking at me. It was a real surprise and she quickly pulled both hands away from her pussy. Then she took them away, turned and slowly walked to me. I was nervous in the way she was standing there. It was still pretty early but she wasn't touching me. She was just standing there, arms still around her legs, looking intently at me as she did. Then she reached out her hands, cupped my face, and leaned slightly toward me so she could kiss me.</p> <p>I don't know what it is but when she kissed me it was different, more passionate. When we kissed it was just the way I dreamed of it but it felt different. It was like a kiss, a light touch, just a little bit of pressure and then like I imagined, it was an open and fast peck that ended with a gentle suck. It didn't last because I had no sense of what it was then, I was being used as a sex toy.</p> <p>I was on fire. I had an erection that was beginning to ache. I leaned back against the door and she went to the counter to get more wine. She took the glass, placed it on the table and then her own. She turned to face me again and she leaned back until the tops of her breasts were pushing against my chest as she leaned against me.</p> <p>Then it just seemed like an instinctive thing for her to kiss me but she didn't. I pulled back.</p> <p>"Will you be ok with me kissing you after she has given me a peck?" I said to her.</p> <p>"As long as you stay with me, Will," was her response.</p> <p>"I'll try not to overdo it," I said, "It doesn't matter."</p> <p>Then she leaned forward for more of a peck. And it was just as I hoped. It was much like a peck that didn't come as quickly as it started. She kissed me with all the passion and I felt her tongue on my lips and on my cheek, and on to my lips and mouth as she kissed me like it was just an ordinary, everyday kiss between friends. And then she took her right hand and gently slid it up my body, under my shirt, and up my chest to my left nipple.</p> <p>Then she began to kiss it again, just slowly and gently. And her tongue was doing what I expected it to. It felt so warm, so wet. When she was done she slowly slid her hands downward towards my jeans, over my groin and up my inner thighs. The moment I felt it; she slipped a couple of fingers under the hem of my t-shirt and then I was completely exposed.</p> <p>Then she slid her fingers into my pants, pulled the waistband of my briefs down and out and into space, I felt like I was going to explode. She slipped her hand back up inside my clothing, then my waist, and up until she could slip a finger in on one side of my love muscle just to the second and then back up and slip again. I wanted to touch her so badly that she pushed her face into my stomach and had her face pressed up against me and took my erection in her mouth.</p> <p>That was the last image I had; my mouth hung open on the doorway watching for any other signs that someone was in the other room. It couldn't have been, it couldn't even have been her hand.</p> <p>She moved her mouth away, leaned over and whispered in my ear. "No, I don't do that. I've never done that with her."</p> <p>I felt stupid. I'd always known she had done it with anybody and she never had. And now I had to experience herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
