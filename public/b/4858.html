"I've heard stories about your equipment," I said.</p> <p>"How you doing, sir. Are you excited?"</p> <p>"You have a very good touch, sir. You'll be very impressed if I keep looking at it."</p> <p>With that, I spread his legs apart as if he were a piece of artwork. I knelt down and started licking, running my tongue along the outside of his cock. He moaned as I started sucking him like a small cock. He leaned over to the closet and brought a couple of things to me. On the shelf was a small box, about three or four inches long, and about as tall as myself. It looked like an ice pack, like a beer bottle. I popped it open as he was about to climb on top of me. We stood there about thirty seconds before he pulled me in and started kissing me. This wasn't a casual kiss, however, this was a full-fledged hot-blooded kiss. Our tongues intertwined with each other for a little while before he pulled back. He looked at me as he pulled the condom out of the box. Looking for approval, he took it off, and, without any more talk, I took his into my mouth. He pulled out for a little while, but then shoved me down with all the force he could muster.</p> <p>He fucked me like that, with long hard thrusts, until he reached the point of no return. I felt his cock throbbing as it exploded into my mouth. I was trying not to choke, but I felt the first spurts of cum. I hadn't been expecting it, which must have been the whole idea of a hot-tongue fuck! As he lay there afterwards, he looked at me, not realizing just how much I had enjoyed what we had done.</p> <p>"You were right," he said. "I knew you could make it worthwhile to me. I didn't say you were perfect; I just meant you're hot. I don't know if you've ever had a blowjob before, but if not, you really are fantastic."</p> <p>"Well, as you can see... you're not the best I've ever had!"</p> <p>"You're my special woman!" he responded, as he hugged me tight. We walked along the dark corridor back into my room, and he fell asleep on the top of the bed.</p> <p>We continued our sex. We continued to make love, with him still being in the same position as he had been in all afternoon. Sometimes we would kiss, even passionately, or even kiss each other. I don't think either of us ever stopped and just stared into each other's eyes. The passion and the need between us grew and grew. I was more than a little afraid we might not be able to continue, and that we might not feel the same level of pleasure.</p> <p>So we would both be in the same boat when we came home from work. I didn't ask him if he wanted me to do it like we had done when we were first married. I didn't tell him if I really wanted him to do it to me, rather that he just be here right in front of me with a hard cock.</p> <p>"It can be a wonderful experience, if it's done right," he said, as we kissed while we sat on my bed, naked beneath our robes, and got to know each other. He explained that this meant we would be more comfortable in each other's presence than being naked in front of each other.</p> <p>"I love the idea! You don't have to get naked with me right away, either. I'll do that too."</p> <p>We had our first date, about six months later. During the evening, we had several glasses of wine. He would kiss me and play with my boobs. It usually took him a while longer to make a girl wet and ready to go. After a while, he would take his time and just kiss and stroke me all over, but first he would tease my lips with his tongue, sometimes running his tongue across my lip, sometimes just pressing on my lips. This, while not so much, was something he enjoyed doing more than kissing and playing.</p> <p>As we had both said at my first date, he liked the look on my face whenever he kissed my mouth. I could feel it in his cock and on my pussy. He even had to have gotten me hot from kissing me! He could take his time, prolonging the contact, and I enjoyed that. He could go at me from just pulling on my hair and running the tip of his tongue along my skin, or kissing me from down the corner of my mouth to the bridge of my nose to just behind my ear. I was feeling a kind of jealousy.</p> <p>In my car, it could only be my imagination... but it would certainly be the first timeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
