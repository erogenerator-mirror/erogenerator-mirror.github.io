I grinned, and she shook her head.</p> <p>"We are going in the back," I said, holding out my arm.</p> <p>Her hand found mine, and she held it against hers, gently.</p> <p>"Let's go. We have about ten minutes and we'll be there," I said, opening the door to the garage, the sun on my face.</p> <p>We got into my car and drove as slowly through town as we could until we came to a large cabin. The front door to the garage was open, as were the windows, so we went inside and looked around. The kitchen looked to have been a gift from the state of California, and the back yard was empty.</p> <p>It was a good looking place with an extensive and elegant kitchen. We ate, ate some coffee, and then retired to my place for a couple hours of loving, petting, and light petting. We ended up in bed one night, spooning and caressing each other as I rolled over, pulling her close and burying my face in her chest.</p> <p>She was breathing hard when we finished, and we fell asleep wrapped in each other's arms. I woke her with a quick kiss, and she woke up with mine, and we fell back asleep.</p> <p>The next morning we headed back to the cottage in a little more time, and saw the two empty boxes in the front room. I pulled my shirt off and climbed on the bed.</p> <p>"You sleep well?" Karen asked, and I shrugged and went back to kissing her.</p> <p>"I slept okay," I murmured sleepily.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I should've warned you, I'm sorry," she whispered.</p> <p>"It's okay," I sighed, and she pulled me close, and kissed me again. "Is you cold, Mom?"</p> <p>"No, not really," she said, leaning forward so we could kiss. "I woke up last night wondering if we had done something."</p> <p>"I'm glad you enjoyed it," I said, my hand covering her small breast. "I'm glad you slept like that. I would have loved to have kept going."</p> <p>"Me too," she added with a laugh. "In fact, you have been going at it with my panties wet all morning."</p> <p>My erection was not quite as impressive as it had been the morning before, but the idea of having her come on my face in the shower that morning was just so wonderful.</p> <p>"You're just right," I whispered with a grin, and Karen's fingers were teasing her sex as we made love.</p> <p>"Mom, I love it when you get that carried away," she said, pushing my hand away from her breast, and we kissed again. "I know you've had a lot planned, and I'm glad you wanted to," she continued.</p> <p>"You're right," I agreed. "It really isn't fair to have you upset just because I'm too fat. I'm going to go shower and change."</p> <p>I kissed her lips, and she said, "No, you go wash up first. Then come to the kitchen so that I can put your bra and panties on you."</p> <p>We took a hot shower together, and I soaped her up a bit, then she rinsed me off. She helped me dry off, and then we went to bed. The next night was Saturday of love, and we had both gotten our clothes put on before we went to bed.</p> <p>We spooned together, and after about an hour of sleeping, we'd both fallen asleep. I woke up Saturday morning and took a quick shower, then had an early breakfast.</p> <p>It was late afternoon when I awoke again with a rush of excited anticipation. I found my mom lying half on top me, and the sheet covering us was gone. I was naked, half covered with her naked body, and she was caressing my cock while she kissed and licked my face. Her hand was stroking me gently while she kissed me and moved to fondle my balls.</p> <p>Suddenly, she was back, and she moved up again. "You know what you are going to do," she said, and she held my rigid cock. She kissed it, then she began to stroke it.</p> <p>"Oh, god, Karen," I moaned as my Mom's lips kissed its way up and down my shaft, her wet tongue sliding over the head of my cock. "Just... don't stop."</p> <p>"My pussy is sore," she said, her lips sliding lower over my cock, sucking the precum from it. "It feels like its been two days since we made love."</p> <p>"It's been two days," I agreed, lifting my hand to my face. "But I can't think of anything else." I let them both suck me for a minuteâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
