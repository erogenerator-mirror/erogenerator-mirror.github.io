I've just started thinking about what it would be like to fuck you and being able to just do with it what I would."</p> <p>He smiled and slid his hand down between her legs and she pushed her hips up into his hand. His finger slipped lower between her pussy lips and his thumb found her clit poking out of it's hood. He slowly circled her clit and she arched her back, pushing her hips against him so his thumb slid easily into her and he slid a second, and a third finger into her pussy and he felt her pussy start to grip his fingers.</p> <p>He began to slowly press his fingers against her pussy walls, sliding them up her vagina to her clit, and then back down, teasing her clit. He knew she was ready to be fucked. He lifted his fingers out of her and slid his tongue up to her swollen clit and lapped up the flowing come. Her hips and pussy muscles clenched his fingers and he slowly slid them deeper into her, pressing them against her g-spot. Then he licked her clit again, and again, as she continued to push her hips against his fingers. He slid his fingers into her and slowly began to move them back out. Her legs began to shake and she started to thrust her hips up more with his fingers and her whole body jerked. Her thighs clamped down around his forearm as he slowly slid two fingers back into her.</p> <p>He slid them back out slowly as she began to shake again, not wanting to cum, but wanting to fuck. He felt her body and soul tremble and felt her whole body tingle with electric energy. She grabbed the bottom of his head and pulled it between her spread legs, as she arched her head back, moaned quietly as her body convulsed and her thighs clamped around his hand and her hips thrust their hips forward, thrusting wildly as the tension released and she started to scream her joy.</p> <p>She thrashed her head back and forth as she came and felt him push his fingers further into her as her pussy spasmed and released her come as she thrust her pelvis up at him, holding his face against her as her pelvis shuddered once more. Her body finally released its tension. Her arms hung limp as her shoulders slumped back against the bed headboard.</p> <p>"I don't know...but the answer to my question is what did it feel like to have her pussy pulsate in my hand," he continued to grin and slid his fingers out of her and stood up before turning around and smiling at her.</p> <p>"Yeah, it's like a different kind of feeling for me," she said with a smile as she reached out and grabbed his hand and pulled him up. "You could feel her heat even though my eyes closed. I had to get her panties off to see just how tight they were against her wet pussy." She felt herself relax as she smiled at him and leaned back on the bed. "I was just wondering...if we made a nice 69 position," she said as she pointed to her thigh and he stood up next to the bed and slowly started to get in position.</p> <p>"We could make do, but no rush," he finished as he slid his pants and his boxers down. He stepped out of them and turned about as she grabbed his dick and pulled him closer so he was sitting on her thigh. She reached up and slid his boxers and shorts off while he slipped his feet out first. As she put the boxers and shorts on her legs opened just enough so he could kneel between them. He kissed her deeply and then sat back down. The kiss lingered longer than they normally did.</p> <p>"I don't want to rush anything," she said as she reached between his legs and lightly ran her fingers along his cock as his arms crossed beside hers. He looked down at her and smiled as his hand slid his hand up and down along her inner thigh. Her thighs opened wider to allow him to run his hand right up to her pussy. As he did he felt the moisture of her lips and parted them with his finger at her wet opening. Then he slid his fingers up to her mouth, coating them in her juices and licked his finger thoroughly before replacing it with his tongue. Then he did the same thing again, letting her taste herself on his tongue.</p> <p>She shuddered and moaned again as his tongue ran over her pussy lips. He licked and sucked on them, as his fingers toyed with her clit and teased her G-spot.
