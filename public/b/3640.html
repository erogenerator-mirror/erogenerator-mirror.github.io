He then asked her for a condom, which she was more than happy to do, but she hesitated. He moved quickly.</p> <p>"You won't need that." He warned her as he got in and started to slide in again.</p> <p>"You really are a selfish bastard." She said as he finally entered her.</p> <p>"Your not my first." He told her as he began to move slowly and deeply.</p> <p>"Oh god, yes!" she hissed as he penetrated and began to move. Soon they were fucking with abandon as his seed flooded her pussy, and within moments he was still deep inside her. "I had to have a quick shower, that stuff was strong! I feel like a little woman though."</p> <p>"Oh yeah, and I'm not sure about a shower, I need to pee." He replied.</p> <p>"Do you want to?"</p> <p>"No I guess not."</p> <p>Once he was dressed, he told her he had some friends that would like to join them for the afternoon. She told him she would be pleased to do it, but not what they had already planned, and that they left for something quieter and more private.</p> <p>A little after five he made his way naked back up the mountain to her place. He put a half sheet on the bed. They went through the door. There were only a handful of candles on the end table and a bottle of wine between them. The only other sign of their activities was a small pile of cloth on the night stand.</p> <p>They made their way back in. A few hours later they were sitting up in bed again. "I got to go." She said looking over at the clock, "I'm late, I'm supposed to be in town in half an hour, so you can take me."</p> <p>"Ok" He replied as he began kissing her, their bodies pressed tightly together. Their kissing got more intense. She ran her hands up and down his back, enjoying the feel of his skin. The kiss ended and her breath came in big gasp. "How about a shower?" He asked as his hand grabbed at her breast again.</p> <p>"But that would be more than just that." She said as she pushed him away. "I have to get ready for work. It's late."</p> <p>"Okay." He replied as he moved his still hard cock to cover her pussy lips again. "So, I think I'll call it a night."</p> <p>"Oh no you don't! I want you in me tonight, right now!" she moaned as she felt his cock again pushing at her insides and then pushing in again. "I just want some more of that cock, right now!"</p> <p>He was getting no sympathy from her. He began to move her as he kissed her, moving himself in and then out of her. Her breathing quickened as he worked in and out. She reached down and began to stroke his cock. "That's nice." He commented when she stopped.</p> <p>She looked at him and smiled. "Can we take turns?" she asked looking at it.</p> <p>"I guess." He replied wondering why she wanted to do this, after all he was hard as a rock.</p> <p>She began to work at him, moving her pelvis in tiny circular motions. Her moans grew more and more intense. The harder he pushed in and away the faster she moved. The sounds she made as they came together increased in volume and frequency as he continued to work her with his cock. She was gasping in each kiss and she felt one finger slide past her lips to caress her clit.</p> <p>Suddenly one finger was pushing into her as her mouth opened wide as her scream came. The feeling was intense and she almost threw up. Then she climaxed again. After a bit she began to rub her clit even faster. She began to think she couldn't take anymore. "Yes, yes, oh god, yes please! I'm gonna come! Oh my god!" Her cries of pleasure filled her room.</p> <p>The next morning it was light. She was going to get ready for her day off, but the last thing she heard was his name. She took a quick shower, dressed and then drove to the office. He was still on the line, so she took the short walk down to his apartment. She walked up the stairs, then turned around. When he opened the door, he asked her for sex. She laughed and told him she'd have sex with him in his bed, but then decided against it. He stood up and she slipped off her panties. He stood there as she took his shorts out of his jeans. She smiled as she stroked the head.</p> <p>"I'm serious. I really don't want to waste anymore hours, so let's just go to bedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
