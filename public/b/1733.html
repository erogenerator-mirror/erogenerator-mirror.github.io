He said. As if I would mind.</p> <p>"Yes. Your first lesson isn't until Monday. We won't be using the bathroom for your next two hours. We will be doing more than just a washcloth to clean up your mess."</p> <p>"No, no, no. I don't know." I tried to protest.</p> <p>"Let's get you cleaned up. I have a nice big bath for you." he said with a wink and a smile.</p> <p>I stood there with the shirt still open and the top sheet over my breasts in place and my panties around half way between my legs. He didn't give me a chance to reply in that I was embarrassed enough already and didn't have any idea why. He lifted the sheet up over me and dropped it on the floor, followed by the other leg. He was completely naked already with his legs spread apart.</p> <p>He got on the bed on all fours like a dog so that he could rub my clit as he rubbed. I came with no warning even though the pleasure was almost a little too strong. He didn't care.</p> <p>He got off the bed and stood there letting the sheet fall to the floor. He grabbed my wrist to help pull me up.</p> <p>"What is it? Do you want to take a shower or something instead?"</p> <p>I thought about it a bit. I still had the feeling in my head that I was too inexperienced. But at least I could say no. He walked down the hall to our bathroom and I just stood there. I don't know why I took the liberty of getting naked. I didn't think I was that kind of girl. I mean I wasn't really into being watched. I never thought I'd be this horny. But the thought of someone else watching me was really turning me on.</p> <p>He walked in behind me and pulled my body back into his. His hands were now squeezing my ass, pulling me into him in a very strong hug. I was a little breathless but I couldn't stop feeling his cock through his underpants. With the next step I was able to open my legs a bit. He pulled them apart even more and we made out. He was hard and huge. I had only ever seen one, but that one was too far gone to say how much I liked it.</p> <p>We broke away and he went to the bathroom.</p> <p>The bathroom was big. It was an ordinary bathroom. His was a huge old, double bedroom. It had four shower heads. He opened the shower door and looked at me. I looked at him while I put the sheet on top of me to hide my modesty. My pussy, my ass, my breasts. I looked away and didn't give much of a fuck before he pushed me against the wall. He grabbed my hair with both hands and pulled my face to his. I started rubbing the front of of his pants. He put his hand up and pushed it down on my tit with his palm. He started kissing me again and I felt so close that I didn't even have to feel him enter my own body. After a few minutes he pulled him out of his briefs revealing the longest, thickest, hardest cock I have ever seen. It was thick and long and looked as big around as a golf ball. He pulled me onto my back as he started to kiss me. The feel of his cock on my pussy, his tongue in my mouth and his hands on my huge tits was awesome. I felt so out of place kneeling on the floor of a bathroom and he had his penis up in a room full of people.</p> <p>He started pushing his cock into me a bit faster. "You are so fucking dirty. I love being dirty. Like I am someone else. But it isn't really me that you need." Then he stopped and got out of the shower, leaving me standing there covered, hands in the water. I tried to get my mind together enough to explain what happened and why I took the chance to come and say it.</p> <p>He came out of the shower with a towel wrapped around his waist. He picked me up and threw me back onto the bed. He crawled around to the side of the bed and turned me onto my stomach on my ass.</p> <p>"That's good." He said. "Wrap your other leg though the one closest to the window. I like to watch you get ass fucked. You know what you were supposed to do to that."</p> <p>This was too good to pass up. "No." I said and then rolled onto all fours. He didn't say anything but walked out of the bathroom and down to the end of the bed.</p> <p>He looked at me and said "I think you should be more careful."</p> <p>I was thinking if this could be my first time onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
