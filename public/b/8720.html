I felt his cock growing as my hand encased him. I lifted off him and stood and faced him. He laughed and pulled me down on him. I knew what was coming and was about to have it. I leaned over and kissed him deeply. His hands reached around and felt my ass cheeks. He cupped me and moved me around and pushed me down onto him in one motion. I felt him in me and loved it. My pussy had never felt so full of cock before, it was incredible. I pushed down. His cock filled me and started to move a little. His hands slid down my body, caressing and touching me. He lifted up, sliding more of his cock up into me. The feeling was amazing. I leaned over and kissed him deeply.</p> <p>He pulled me back up. He kissed me again, not this whole time. Before I knew what I wanted, we were kissing again. He lifted me up again and moved me around and spread me open for him. He slid back in me, deeper this time. I turned my head, looking for him, to tell him, but he moved back into me. The feeling was electric. I kissed him, our mouths locked together.</p> <p>His hands went to my breasts and rubbed and fondled them. His cock was sliding in and out of me as he thrust into me. He continued pulling me to him until I was fully used to his cock.</p> <p>"Are you cumming?" he whispered in my ear.</p> <p>"Mmm hmmm." was my reply as I felt him explode deep inside of me. I could tell instantly that I had done to him what I had just done to him.</p> <p>They both stopped kissing long enough to turn as if it were the most natural thing in the world to do in the position they were in. He ran his hands down my body, down over my ass, and over my pussy. He fingered me over and over, driving me crazy. I was already on the edge, and never before had it felt so good.</p> <p>He looked at me for a few moments, and slowly pulled his cock out of me. He was still hard. He had been building up for nearly ten minutes, and I was ready to come again, if he would push back in. I could tell by the way he was looking at me right then.</p> <p>"I'm not going to stop until you are." he said. I just smiled and looked at him in the eye as he slid his cock back into me, hard and deep. A couple of strokes and he was deep inside me in one thrust. I looked up to see his eyes closed tight, and that was it. I came on his cock. Spasm after spasm, and that was it for me. I had never stopped being horny. I wanted him to move in me the same way he had, not in my pussy. I knew what I wanted and he let go of me, pushing me back onto the bed. I lay there and watched his cock drive in and out of me. He moved his hips to thrust into me, to fuck me as hard as he could. His hand reached under my head and I heard him sucking as he had a breast. It took all of my concentration not to scream with pleasure right then. He was fucking with all his might, but it couldn't be more than a few strokes before I felt him spasm, and his warm cum explode in me.</p> <p>He pulled out of me, and lay down next to me. "That was wonderful!" he said, and kissed my ear.</p> <p>With a devilish grin, I climbed off the bed and looked at him.
