I want to be her lover. You are the most beautiful woman I know for the ages. I know that there are many young lesbians in America, including the mother of my son, and, of course, she's a bit older and I'm not old. That's why I chose Victoria. I'm not in her league."</p> <p>"Yes, you definitely have a reputation, not that of one of those college-aged teenagers in the US whose reputation is as well known to you as it is to me. You've made me the sole recipient of your fame."</p> <p>"No, Victoria was all mine. I've chosen you to be my lover. I love you and will always love you. It's too risky otherwise to give an honest answer in hopes you'll become my wife." I laughed. "We should find our next position of mutual love?"</p> <p>"It's not a proposition I'd come up with. The one that does have its downside. I like you and feel you could have a romantic relationship with me. However, that could be dangerous. We have no intention of having children. I'm not ready to carry on with a lover in such a way. It only seems right to break the ice where it should or can be."</p> <p>"I think you've already broken the ice, haven't you?"</p> <p>"Yes, I guess we have."</p> <p>"So, are you willing to leave college with me or will you want to go back home?"</p> <p>"Both, I guess."</p> <p>"I might tell you that I've already signed a contract with a local firm that makes an effort to get our marriage to a point where we can actually be intimate with each other. That's because they know our likes and dislikes."</p> <p>"Are you sure you're ready for that? If you want to leave here next week, of all the girls who'll be asking you about this conversation, what would make you accept?"</p> <p>"I've decided, and I want to stay."</p> <p>"It's too dangerous for you to stay if you still don't want to be with me. It's even worse for you. If you still want him to live with me, then the contract sounds okay."</p> <p>"I know it's risky, but I've been trying to find a reason to stay in your firm."</p> <p>"I don't want to be seen as a charity case like your other clients."</p> <p>"I know you don't want me, and you shouldn't have to do this. I know you've been working so hard and you're taking time to think about it. You know that I have some other girls who would like to stay with you, but it's not what you want to do."</p> <p>"I want to stay with you. I've always wanted to do this but I just can't."</p> <p>"I'm ready to move back home. We should go ahead and get married. I'm sure you could use a loving wife."</p> <p>The last thing I heard was Victoria say, "I love you, I'm ready to go, but I have to be with the two of you to do that for me to have a baby. I don't think that I can take that risk again."</p> <p>"No, that's okay. I won't make it that easy."</p> <p>After a while we went back to talking about business; about what we're going to do in future; about how we both felt about the idea of doing other, mutually pleasurable experiences for us to share our bodies as we knew each other for years.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The next couple of times we had sex together, Victoria had the same conversation as we had before, she asked me about what I was going to do about my sex life, and, she didn't make me feel bad: "I love getting fucked, sometimes not at all, but always having sex with the guy. If I wanted to keep it as a surprise for him, I could, but it would break our marriage."</p> <p>I loved her for that honesty on her part. I could feel the desire to do something that might be a little less, much more, dangerous. I never did get to see Victoria's face before, but it was enough that I know if she did see my face then she must have been looking in my eyes.</p> <p>It was only the past couple of months that I could remember what she was looking at in a positive light, she kept looking in my eyes, and I could see how happy she was looking at me as much as I was at her. It was as if she could feel me when she looked up at me, but she didn't see the expression, I could feel her, it was like she was looking intoâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
