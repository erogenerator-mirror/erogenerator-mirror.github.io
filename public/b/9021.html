It is not that I had much experience here, but this country has changed since the war ended. It is quite different now and all it has to do is move to another country. I’m not sure why I want to go there, but I have never been there before. Just look at the pictures I seen,” she told herself.</p> <p>“Look at pictures of you when you were young and I had a good look,” she added. “You look good too for that age,” she said and suddenly felt sorry for herself.</p> <p>Again she thought for a very long time. She did not know if she could leave. “Where have I heard this before?” she thought. “I can’t leave, I am a grown woman, and you have to leave,” she said to herself.</p> <p>She looked at the clock, “11… 12…”</p> <p>At 1.30 am she said “I can’t.”</p> <p>As she was at that time, she saw a car pulling into the drive. With a sudden movement, she put her hands in the pockets of her jacket and said “You are early,” she said to the car.</p> <p>As the young girl watched the old man drive away, she felt as if she were in a nightmare. “I am sorry if I bothered you,” she said to the man.</p> <p>Although she was frightened, Lisa noticed nothing else as he drove away and when he turned in the car, she saw him looking at her.</p> <p>“Do you want it, Miss,” he continued.</p> <p>“If you don’t mind,” she said to him. “If I can help you here, I can make some money and I can take care of myself as much as you could. I am your friend,” she added as she shook her head.</p> <p>“Would you have lunch with me,” said the old man to Lisa.</p> <p>“Yes, would you be there,” she said, looking at the clock on the mirror.</p> <p>He drove off into the night.</p> <p>The End</p> <p>It is now 1am—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
