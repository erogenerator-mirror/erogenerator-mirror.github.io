He was getting annoyed with me for letting him talk too much. 'I saw your face as I got to your desk...' I laughed at this, feeling quite relieved.</p> <p>'No, it's not that I'm not happy to see you. It's just that I got a little overwhelmed, my friend.' He didn't like my mentioning his ex, or that he had to take care of some other girl.</p> <p>'I've got a friend. He... he gave me some money to have my car back... I have not taken him home. It's nice to have a friend...' I said, knowing that it was going to make him look bad, that his girlfriend is a cheating bitch.</p> <p>'You know how I feel about men, I can't change this.' He said, giving me a good smile.</p> <p>'It's so hard not to think about you in bed... I think you're going to need someone to talk to. I mean... if you want to tell someone, we will go straight to the phone. What would you like me to do?' He gave me a playful look.</p> <p>I thought this would be the moment where we could see what others thought, but our relationship is in a mess right now and not something that could be discussed. I told him that he didn't need to call anyone, because he was my friend. I would tell him everything, but he could not tell anyone. I did not want him to be the only one that I would see, but I also wanted to see him naked, so that I am able to tell the person who I would talk to.</p> <p>'I'd appreciate helping you...' He was very excited.</p> <p>'I'd love to help you, but I really don't know what to say....' I said to him.</p> <p>'I think you are beautiful, but I don't want to know your name. You were a good friend to me, but now I don't have that.' He said, staring down at me.</p> <p>'I can't do anything... It's just going to have to be you, ok? You don't have to tell anyone...' His eyes were pleading.</p> <p>'I will, that's not a problem.' He said, putting some distance between us. His hand came up to my breasts, and he placed his palm over my nipple. I started moaning softly. His palm moved around my breast feeling my excitement. I took my hand away from his, and looked into his eye. He looked back, and without saying anything, he grabbed my other arm and pushed me against the floor of a classroom. I followed him obediently, feeling his hard cock press against my leg.</p> <p>He pushed me on my back, kissed me firmly, and took my hand in his. He guided my hand onto his cock. I was happy to have my hand held by a man, because it felt so good inside me. He started kissing me again, and I started making a rhythm and started to moan into his mouth. He slowly broke the kiss, and looked into my eyes.</p> <p>'Are you ready?' He asked, looking into my eyes.</p> <p>'Y-yes...." I replied, blushing with shame.</p> <p>He started kissing me again, but very gently.</p> <p>'I bet you're ready?' He asked me.</p> <p>'Yes.... I am ready.' I whispered, thinking that he was in fact going to make me say all the things that I said that day in front of the group.</p> <p>He made me sit on the ground on my lap, taking my hand and placing it on his dick. I moved my hand up and down its softness, and looked into his eyes once again. He smiled at this, and started kissing me again, placing a hand over my breasts, moving my body with it. He kept kissing me with his mouth, while sliding his hand inside mine. I started feeling his dick, and he whispered in my ear.</p> <p>'Does that feel good?'</p> <p>I nodded feeling good. I felt the pleasure coming from the touch of his hand inside mine, and wanted to feel it all.</p> <p>'Let's do it again.' He said, giving me a smile.</p> <p>I pulled his hand from mine, and placed it on his dick. I looked down at his dick with a questioning smile. I grabbed and started squeezing his dick through his pants. He looked at me with a look of pleasure in his eyes. I didn't want to hurt his feelings so I pulled his shirt out, and got down on my knees in front of him. I was afraid to put on any clothing. I had some things to get off my mind, to make me feel better, but I wanted him to make me feel good. I put my hand on his crotch and began to undress him. He lifted my neckâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
