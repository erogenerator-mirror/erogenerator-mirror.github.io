It was one o'clock.</p> <p>Lara stood up walked over to me, embraced me and we kissed deeply.</p> <p>"I'll be right back."</p> <p>She headed back to the bathroom to clean up.</p> <p>I glanced at the clock. It was one thirty. I looked at the clock I was looking at.</p> <p>I had just spent the previous ten hours fucking my young lover. At least eight hours.</p> <p>It seemed like it was only our wedding night to get married. The sex was incredible. Her and I enjoyed each other's bodies, I did her to, I fucked her silly and got lucky to make an orgasm like hers happen to us both.</p> <p>When I looked at the clock again I knew it would be twenty-ish before we knew what time to call them.</p> <p>Lara's voice said, "It sounds like you have something to do before we go to bed.</p> <p>I glanced at the clock three thirty. It hit two fifty at the time.</p> <p>I told my lovely lady, "I'll join you in a minute. I just need to clean up." She said "No, the time for bed is here. But first I need something to drink first."</p> <p>I said, "Thanks, I'll be right up."</p> <p>I heard her running. Then I heard her running again.</p> <p>I looked at the clock. It said it was six forty-five. It was three thirty.</p> <p>All of her lovemaking had been wonderful tonight. I felt like a king tonight in my life.</p> <p>My beautiful wife was having a nice life with me. I knew I felt the same way because we had discussed her and I made love with her every night. I liked her and I loved her.</p> <p>I was having a great evening, but I had missed something. But I didn't have to go to a bar for a few drinks. Besides I don't care if the bartender comes up to my table with a cup of bourbon.</p> <p>After all, I am a big man and my wife is a little girl.</p> <p>I stood up and put on my robe. Then I went to the kitchen. I pulled the door open a crack and pulled the chair across from the stove to get a drink. "What's going on?"</p> <p>The voice was coming from the bathroom. "What did you mean your little wife is having a nice life with you last night?"</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I said, " I didn't mean that, I mean that at least I did enjoy myself."</p> <p>"I am sorry again. Are you just telling me that you enjoyed yourself?"</p> <p>"Yes. Yes, it's my pleasure, that is my point."</p> <p>The little girl came out of the bathroom, put her head down. She was wearing a red robe.</p> <p>I went to the counter, poured her a bourbon.</p> <p>My mind was confused. I knew she was only eighteen but it was one of her many years before that.</p> <p>I picked up her glass and drank. It was very full and I'm sure it was very sweet too.</p> <p>She had her arms behind her and had pushed herself up against me. Then she wrapped her arms around me and her soft full lips and her lovely little tongue were on me.</p> <p>I pushed her away and took of my robe and robe. I sat on the bed and began to dry my hair with several soft fluffy towels. I put the soap in my suitcase then leaned back on my elbows. My lovely wife looked so beautiful lying there, she was looking up to the ceiling.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I said, "I didn't mean it that way. I didn't think of it that way either."</p> <p>"It's okay," she says, "I loved it too."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I continued, then, "I just meant when we are married it can't get better than that. I know, I can't talk it that way." Then I pulled her up to me and we kissed some more.</p> <p>Then I said, "Lara, you are beautiful."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm so happy," she said, "thank you for saying that." Then she said, "I didn't mean to go so farâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
