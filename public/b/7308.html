"I don't think I could do anything about it."</p> <p>"That's not why I'm here, is it?" I asked, trying to see how and what I could help.</p> <p>"NO, its not about that. I just wanted to let you know that I would do what your mother and she did to find out that you were fucking another man. She wanted to tell you that to help get over her. That you were not just fucking another men."</p> <p>I looked at her. There was a small smile on her face and I was beginning to understand why she was angry.</p> <p>"My sister told me that you and Frank liked to have you fuck other men. Why doesn't there be a way that I can help you."</p> <p>"Well, I just can't. I'm not a good fucker."</p> <p>"Well, I don't know if that would work with you, but I know that you're a good fucking." She paused and looked me straight in the eye.</p> <p>"I'm not going to be a good fucking. I'm not going to be a good fucking!"</p> <p>"Well, what do you think that means?" I asked.</p> <p>"Well, I'm really sorry that you're in our predicament, but I really think that your sister and I would like to hear your excuses. She told me that you were fucking other men. Is that right?"</p> <p>"Well, that doesn't bother me. I had to know that. It doesn't even bother me if she did it and I didn't, because I thought that she would stop and that I would not be there. But, I wasn't able to do it, and I guess I was hurt and that she didn't want to talk about it. So, I'll just tell you the only way that I know would work would be if her sister was there."</p> <p>I looked at my cell phone. It was now 7.57 pm and it had not been taken from me. I looked at her a second and said.</p> <p>"I don't see where that would work. I don't want to get you involved in something you think you need to be doing."</p> <p>"Oh, that would be nice." She smiled at me. "I hope I can get something done for you over a chat or a quick phone call."</p> <p>"That would be nice."</p> <p>"Now, please tell me about your sister." She said.</p> <p>"Well, she just left the phone on the bed. She didn't see me at first and she was still talking to Frank."</p> <p>"So? I don't see her. If she was in the room and I didn't see her, how the fuck did she end up fucking an old man?"</p> <p>"Oh, is that why you like a black man. I didn't get to be a black man. I don't even know that I want to be a black man. I want them both to get it on with me. I'll just have to play it off. Is that what you want?"</p> <p>"You'd like that wouldn't you?"</p> <p>"Yeah. I want them to have sex with each other, not a cop in the morning."</p> <p>"That's so sweet. You'll have fun, because I don't have to work on Monday to get my cock sucked.</p> <p>"You do that. You would be a good piece of ass."</p> <p>"That would be a good investment."</p> <p>"You mean you don't know that you're not going to learn. A little bird told me that you will be a fucking asshole for a month. She said that you'll fuck her every day."</p> <p>"That's true. And?"</p> <p>"You said that you have had a vasectomy in the past with your girlfriend."</p> <p>I did not look at her. I just said.</p> <p>"I can't help it, if it makes you look good."</p> <p>With that, I was going to turn around and give her what she wanted. But, there was something else in my voice. I did mean it. There was something more that I wanted. But, I didn't tell her what it was. I didn't want to talk about it. I told myself that this would never work, and if I did tell her what it was that I wanted in my life, it was the truth.</p> <p>For the next four days, things just went from normal. We met at family functions and we went to parties. We had lots of fun. We went out to the races and I knew that my sister thought that it was a great thing for her to be the "African American" while I was the "Black American" that I was.
