I'm trying to get you back to your senses," I whispered. I didn't know what to call her. I felt so small and vulnerable; all this time I was still in love with her.</p> <p>"I'm afraid that's why I didn't go out with you one last time."</p> <p>"No you didn't."</p> <p>"How? I don't have to." As I thought of her, my heart nearly stopped. I felt the tears spring instantly upon me. Why did I have to come so far from the woman who'd been so much in love with me?</p> <p>"Well I've told myself that once. I told you that I was with a man and I've known that for a little while," she said. She was quiet for a few seconds until she spoke.</p> <p>"I love you," she said, looking up at me through her lashes, "that's why I came back." She leaned up and kissed me on the cheek again. "Can I come back soon?"</p> <p>I didn't know what to say. I was afraid.</p> <p>"I am sorry about that," she told me. "I have to go," she said. She took the suitcase off the walker and held it before walking out of the room. The pain in my heart just stopped it.</p> <p>I couldn't let her go back. That wasn't fair. I couldn't let her go back. I thought about leaving, I thought about how she looked and felt. I thought about telling her to stay at the apartment and go with a stranger.</p> <p>"Don't," I said to myself before I spoke again. I didn't want to believe in anything. I could only hope that she wanted me as much as I wanted her. She'd never really love me the same way as I loved her. So I was afraid.</p> <p>I tried to go through the door again. I couldn't. This was the end. I couldn't bring Kitten back now. I'd never be able to forget her.</p> <p>I walked up the stairs to my apartment. I couldn't go back. I had to go. I had to. I made my way into the bedroom. Kitten was in the middle of the day. Her bed was empty and not in the middle of any of our plans as I had hoped. The bed was empty. The television wasn't on either. I could still find my way back to my room, but it was not where it had belonged.</p> <p>If I could just find Kitten, she may be able to forgive me. After all I had helped her through the past few weeks. I still needed her. She was worth it to me. It was not a matter of taking her back. All I could think of was Kitten. I needed her. I couldn't force her back. At the risk of sounding like a jerk, if I were to stay with her for a very long time I thought I would have a much better chance of finding out if she loved me, if she would be willing to stay in love with me. I had to find her.</p> <p>The phone rang. I picked it up. I could hear the sounds of our hearts and the ringing of the receiver. I put it to my ear and listened to our hearts. Nothing, nothing, nothing. She wasn't there. I heard and felt her voice in the background. Nothing but the sound of her voice.</p> <p>"She's alright," I thought, "This is over. Go back to what they call friendship now, Kitten. Go back to what they call friendship now. Go back to being the friend you always were."</p> <p>"I love you," I thought to myself. "I'm not hurting anyone else. I love Kitten," I said to myself. I had to find her and bring her back to me.</p> <p>*************</p> <p>Kitten was right when she said that she could forgive me...I am still so much the same as I was once I was a child. I'm almost nineteen now. My parents gave me more than a hand with my studies. For the first time in probably ever I was able to have a full day's work done. I was able to take my classes as well.</p> <p>I really had no reason to go back now because it was over. It wasn't my fault. What I had to do to get her back for her pain. I couldn't let her go back. When I thought she would be there again, I didn't want it.</p> <p>By the time Kitten got home I was already on my feet and moving. She had dinner ready and waiting for me. I was sitting at the dining room table, eating my breakfast. It was a Sunday morning. I got another plate and brought it to the table.</p> <p>"Kitten," Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
