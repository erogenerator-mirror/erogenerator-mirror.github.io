We lay there for a while just enjoying each other and falling asleep in each others arms.</p> <p>In the morning, I woke up to the sound of a knocking at the door. I rolled over to look at it and saw Mrs. Sanders standing there with a cup of coffee.</p> <p>"Can I get your things?"</p> <p>"Thanks," she replied and went over to the door.</p> <p>The next morning, after our second time with him, we had just finished eating breakfast and were just talking as we ate. She said she'd seen our room last night and was worried about what I was doing, but she said she was relieved to see that I was okay and that I must still be out and would be home before noon.</p> <p>After we ate breakfast and got out of bed, we went to the kitchen, poured a couple of cups of coffee and started making breakfast. I'd been using a banana and she picked up a banana when I went back to the bedroom and started to open the refrigerator. I looked over at her, looked at her as she poured some juice in her glass and drank some of it. In doing so, she leaned against me and we kissed and fondled each other.</p> <p>"That was nice."</p> <p>"It was nice."</p> <p>"I want to do it again," she said to me.</p> <p>I looked over at her and said, "I'm sorry."</p> <p>"No, it's okay. It was nice. I have lots of experience, but I don't want to hurt you. I do think you should be doing that if that's what you want."</p> <p>"We should," I told her.</p> <p>"Okay," she said.</p> <p>We started eating our breakfast and drinking coffee. We talked quietly and when our food was gone, we hugged and then leaned back against the kitchen counter. Once we got over that, we sat next to each other and I took a nipple in my mouth. Then we kissed and fondled each other's breasts, as we nibbled on each others tongues and explored each others wet pussies.</p> <p>After a while, I rolled off of her and we laid back against the kitchen counter, kissing and fondling each other, with my hands all over her body as I played with my nipples; first between her legs, and then pulling back on the lips and caressing them. She was moving her hips and squirming under my touch. I put one finger inside the lips, and probed around between them.</p> <p>"We can't go any faster," she whispered.</p> <p>"I want to," I replied.</p> <p>I began to run my finger over her clit, first with my finger moving in small circles around it with one motion; then I slid several fingers in her as she moaned gently. I kept it up until I could see the top of her vagina glistening with moisture, and her clit appeared and disappeared.</p> <p>"Oh, god," she exclaimed softly.</p> <p>We kissed, and caressed each other's bodies with our hands, until we both had orgasms. We cleaned up and had a couple of glasses of orange juice later, after we were all dressed again and had coffee and toast.</p> <p>We decided to go to the club again the next day and have a few drinks before lunch. Before we left, Brenda said, "I need to ask a favor."</p> <p>"Sure," I told her.</p> <p>"Take my virginity."</p> <p>"Oh," was my shocked gasp.</p> <p>"No, No, You need to do the same thing."</p> <p>"Hang on a second," I said as I walked over to my dresser and took off my nightie.</p> <p>In the midst of that, I said to Brenda, "I need to wear this."</p> <p>"In that case, I know what it is. Take it off," she said while sitting up against the headboard of my bed.</p> <p>I undid the bottom part of my nightie and slid it off. I had removed my undies when I was changing in the shower and Brenda's eyes just widened.</p> <p>"Oh, my god! You're naked," she exclaimed.</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"I want you to see me."</p> <p>When I got to the bed, she stood up and sat down beside me and said, "Show me."</p> <p>I removed my underwear. I then lay back down on the bed, and removed her panties and mine, but then told her to turn toward my face.</p> <p>She did and I asked her, "Show me."</p> <p>She stood up and then bent over, spread her legs slightly and put her hands on the bed, with her ass high in the air. I was very happy to see itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
