When she was ready, she moved to a supine position straddling my crotch; our bodies came together and I could feel her hard nipples pressing into my chest. Our kissing began again; hers took over as well, as our kisses deepened. I rolled her over and pulled her down so that our tongues could find each other as the pleasure increased.</p> <p>Neither of us wanted this gentle activity to end; neither wanted it to hurry. Our hands played in the tangle of hair she had in front of her face, she reached up and touched the hair, and her fingertips ran lightly into mine. Our kisses turned more intense, my arms around her holding her as I rolled our bodies into an increasingly wild position. Each touch of our bodies made her gasp louder, she was soon moving her hips in an almost imperceptible rocking motion.</p> <p>The sounds of our bodies slapping together became louder and we were soon lost in a sexual reverie. She lifted my shoulders up allowing me reach down between us to the small of her back as I slid my tongue deep into her mouth. Our tongues danced together as her body trembled on top of mine. She was writhing with ecstasy as her hands held my head, my arms held her ass. My tongue probed her mouth as she moaned with her tongue thrusting in and out.</p> <p>I could feel myself ready to orgasm; I moved my hands to her breasts, my thumbs gently stroking her nipples bringing new waves of pleasure to her body. I held her ass tight, lifting my left leg and putting my foot flat on the mattress behind me. Holding her ass with my legs, I reached down between us to finger her clit causing her to shudder in another wave.</p> <p>When I thought she was done, I leaned back and let her kneel on the bed; my cock lying on her stomach as she straddled me. She leaned forward, putting her chest near my face. I ran the flat of my tongue on her right breast and she moaned with pleasure. I rolled her nipple between my teeth and she let out a little gasp. She raised her breast toward my mouth taking my mouth off her nipple. I teased it with my tongue as she ran my tongue across it. Leaning forward I licked the sensitive nipple sending shivers through her body.</p> <p>With my free hand I ran her lower back, sliding it into the soft silk of her hair, drawing it in my fingers. I moved my tongue lower until I reached her navel. Her skin was taut as I stroked the tiny patch of pubic hair. I continued to stroke her with my tongue while nibbling her skin.</p> <p>Pushing her hair aside, I kissed her belly as my fingers ran a trail down to her pussy. I ran a single finger through her pussy, dipping in between her lips and up to her clit. I held my finger there as her labia opened, I teased her clit with my tongue while lightly stroking her clit with my finger. Soon a loud moan escaped from her mouth.</p> <p>"God...yes...oh God..." she sighed, "Suck it, suck me. Suck me..."</p> <p>I leaned forward with my right hand on the bed, my left hand under her ass, I lowered her pussy until she was resting on my mouth. With my tongue in her hole, I worked her clit with my finger and slowly pumped it in and out while I ran my tongue between her pussy lips. Soon another loud moan was forthcoming and then a louder scream. Her pussy clamped tight around my finger, she pushed against me, her whole body shaking.</p> <p>When the last tremors had settled, she lay on me with an open smile. She ran her fingers through the wetness between my legs.</p> <p>"Wow," she softly sighed, "That was incredible. I've never done that before. I've never been with one man before."</p> <p>It felt strange, and it made me feel like a teenager again. I lifted her gently off my face and kissed her shoulder. She kissed me again.</p> <p>"You're good, Tom, you're very good."</p> <p>"Are you okay?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes, it's good. I think I'll try it again."</p> <p>"Can we do it again?" I said, not wanting to rush her. "We have a long day ahead. We just need practice."</p> <p>"We need practice?" she asked. "Oh God yes, we need practice. Don't keep me waiting for long; we've got all day."</p> <p>In the dark she asked, "Should I put on my thong?" she laughed.</p> <p>"If you want, I'll make the call."</p> <p>My cock was standing at attention as I lay on my back waiting for her.
