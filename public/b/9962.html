Thanks."</p> <p>"You will get better with practice, I promise."</p> <p>"Okay. I'll go." She quickly grabbed the paper bag and walked out the door, not leaving yet, looking back a question every time she closed the door.</p> <p>She never forgot anything that she said about having this in her life. She couldn't tell whether she still considered him worthy of her love. She knew he had taken care of her, not a kid, but her husband, and now her whole life.</p> <p>She sat on a stool waiting. Her feet were still bare. Her face was still red as if she had been too sore. She sat with hands clasped behind her head to wait for him to return. Her knees were still hurting from the shoes. She felt as if she was giving up her life for this, but she couldn't see the words to describe it.</p> <p>"Well, I'm gonna start in the lab. I'll be at home working for the next few days. If you need anything, you just let me know."</p> <p>She turned to go leaving him standing there. With her free hand she reached for and pulled him towards her, wrapping her arms around his neck. She pulled herself up on it, and he felt his cock hardening. "You need something to help you get used to it." She whispered in his ear.</p> <p>"I could use something to help you in the lab."</p> <p>"Oh? You have no idea."</p> <p>She kissed him with passion. "It's hard work, to get that hard on in. You need to go help me. I'll stay till you get it back down." She kissed him one last time before standing, and going inside to leave him lying on the stool.</p> <p>"God, that felt so good!" he exclaimed.</p> <p>"Yeah, you did. And we really need to get the other one up. You are amazing. I'm so glad you called meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
