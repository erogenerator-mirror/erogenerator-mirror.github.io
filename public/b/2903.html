I want you to be able to make wonderful, wonderful babies for us. If you'll be here to help me, I'd love to have a second chance and to see my parents while I have it. They're so nice, so welcoming. But I'm not ready to be a daddy yet," I whispered.</p> <p>"Okay," he responded, kissing my lips and then giving me an affectionate hug. "I really feel like I can help you feel the most in a sense."</p> <p>For the next few weeks, it seemed like the whole household was going to be a total circle from my heart to my dick. At least, until it was time to add a new pair, which was now nearly every day!</p> <p></p> <p>The second day arrived, and my parents had a very nice barbecue outside at my parents' home. With all of the drama, food, entertainment, and all the preparations for a child's birth, it didn't take for me to see a nice, bright smile on Mommy's mommy face when I got the call at the door for her birthday party.</p> <p>"Are you ready for breakfast?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, I think I'll have breakfast ready for this very nice big birthday surprise." She smiled and kissed me gently.</p> <p>"You have no idea, do you?" I teased.</p> <p>"Not a bit, baby," she replied with a wink. She took a key from her pocket in a small, silver, little, silver purse, and opened it. "My parents think their baby is going to be a lot of fun!"</p> <p>"I don't know if I'll have the energy to try to get a date tonight, but I'll do my best," I replied. We left the kitchen at the same time and went to my room to check the latest DVD list.</p> <p>I spent several moments looking through my phone as I listened carefully to what everyone was saying to one another. It's a good thing I'd come home when my parents had the kids, because the kids all called me at the same time. I found a couple of pictures of a girl and a boy sitting around on a couch chatting happily. One photo showed the happy couple sitting on a couch, while one of the boys sat next to them.</p> <p>While the pictures and a video had been very good, I'd never even heard of such a thing happening in a house. I got some tissues and started jilling off with the box of tissues on the coffee table by my bed. I looked at my watch, and realized it was only two minutes till I should be going. I grabbed the tissues and started jilling off too. I'm not sure how fast I could go without losing my load, but I'm not sure how many strokes to keep the cum in my balls. I felt that I should just go. I should just make the best of it.</p> <p>It was a little after two when I heard my door knock, and I knew it was time to go. I quickly opened it, and the surprised look on Mrs. Brown’s face brought me instantly out of my fantasy. I turned and ran to my room to shower and get dressed. I quickly left the computer to show that "I did all of that" as Mommy called it, and grabbed my jacket and shoes. I ran down to the beach house to catch some rays.</p> <p>I was feeling great as I ran across the grass in my sandals. I really got a kick out of the excitement of being in my parents' favorite little bikinis, swimming in the nude and having two beautiful adults around. My mind kept running through their conversations, their happy smiles and their happy expressions throughout the day. I was feeling really mellow as I made my way back to my room, hoping for the good news from my parents.</p> <p>I was hoping for two more days until I knew what I was going to do. I was having trouble remembering the name I got me that afternoon, and I was sure someone was calling me by my name again.</p> <p>A couple of days later, I had the most beautiful woman I had ever seen come in when my mother's voice startled me.</p> <p>"It's a beautiful afternoon, isn't it Mom?"</p> <p>"Yes it is," I replied softly.</p> <p>"Why don't you call it a day. I want you to have at least ten more days on your hands, and we can discuss all of this in the morning."</p> <p>"I can't. I can't do that."</p> <p>"No," she said softly, stroking my shoulder, "I can, and I will. It's my day, and if we can make a grandchild, we will have it."</p> <p>My heart skipped a beat as she said those three words. I'd been so proud to be her son, and she'd been so proud of him.
