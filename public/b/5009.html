"Did you... did Mom take you home?" she asked.</p> <p>"No, no, no, honey. We just had a lovely night and I'm so proud of you." I said, and then added, "And now we are going to be together for life, or at least forever."</p> <p>We spent the next two days planning the wedding. Mary came home on time, picked out a dress and, she said, put it on.</p> <p>Mom and Dad had the wedding rehearsal out on the front lawn and then I went and found Dad outside, dressed in a white cravat. I looked him over. His skin was a fine golden color, and his facial features looked soft and fresh. His hair was tied tightly back in a ponytail. I thought he had the same look, but we hadn't decided on a haircut. Dad wore a pair of gray cotton shorts and a t-shirt. I thought he looked great. He looked pretty rugged; I didn't recognize him, but from what I could guess it was about the same height as his parents. In fact, the two of them were about the same height as his father, only a little taller. I wondered if that made it a little awkward for me to date any older than my own father, but I didn't bother with it.</p> <p>Dad met Mom at the door, his eyes never leaving her face. I said, "Let's go get a drink on the veranda and watch the ceremony. I'll cook the meal, but after we eat it will have to wait until we're married. I'm going to go and pack a picnic basket, and Mary and I will meet you in the lounge area at nine. Mom and Dad will be gone for two days until we can take the boys to town."</p> <p>We watched a little television, and then we left the house together, and drove back to our motel. After the meal on the veranda, we returned to the patio, where we found our two best suitors chatting merrily.</p> <p>The second the door closed, the conversation became animated. They were both laughing as we walked by. My guess was that the two of them were at least six years apart.</p> <p>"Okay." Dad said, "I don't want to think about it, okay?" He was smiling at me.</p> <p>"Okay." I replied. "You know, your mom and I had a good time tonight as well. I think that might be in part because of the wine."</p> <p>"Yes." Dad replied. "The wine did sound nice. But no one made fun of it in that movie because we don't believe in it."</p> <p>"Maybe we're going to find out in the movie that movie is one of your favorites." I said.</p> <p>"I guess the two of us will." Dad replied. "The other thing I want is for me to get a promotion, so I'm thinking I'm going to get one of the top acting jobs."</p> <p>"Are you getting anything out of this, or did you have some other reason to work?" I asked, smiling, and hoping she would tell me her plan.</p> <p>Dad smiled and said, "No. You don't have to worry about the money. I just want you to know that I've never been happier in my whole life, and I'm sure you can tell. And I love you very much, but this is what I'm looking for. I'm looking for a real man, a man with a real future."</p> <p>The look in his eyes brought my mind back to the evening before. I decided to play along with him and asked, "You know what I'm supposed to say, right? I mean, you don't have to worry about the money."</p> <p>"I do love you, too." Dad replied. "But I really don't have to worry about the money. Believe me; there's other things I want to do. I'm looking for a career, a successful wife who's going to be a good wife to the man I love, the kind who is looking forward to all of the things that make love to her, and then the things that make it better for us all."</p> <p>Dad pulled away, and turned to look at me, his expression serious. He smiled. "I've talked to all of them. Both women and men are in the same category."</p> <p>"Oh. Well you're in the same category." I replied. "But I'm a married woman. I need to know where I fit in my future." I said, as I picked up a napkin and dabbed at the tears on it. "You know what I mean, right? There's no future in talking about your marriage, not now anyway. You don't need any more money. You're going to love this, I know you doâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
