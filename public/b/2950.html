"Oh yes...fuck me hard." He ordered her, and immediately she obeyed him without any question.</p> <p>She was on her knees on the mattress in front of him with her ass in the air, he thrust his cock in and out of her, and was fucking the shit out of her wet pussy. His thrusts got deeper and deeper and she could almost feel his balls tighten up against her. She moaned and groaned with every thrust, begging him with each one to fuck her harder and faster. She felt like he would make her a hundred times over, so she didn't make the first move. If he wanted to make her an orgasm for him all the time, then so be it...</p> <p>His thrusts became rippling, and she could feel the pressure building that is the moment of release. The tip of his cock was hitting her spot in her and she could actually feel it as it throbbed and twitched inside of her, and began to pulse through his cock. He thrust one last time before he stopped, and told her to stand, and to turn around, and they hugged and kissed. "That was fantastic! Your pussy feels so good. Thank you" He had a devilish look in his eyes as he said that, and she knew that he had also seen into her body, and had seen the way she'd masturbated thinking of being fucked by him, and now she was going to be fucked by him like that.

She was moaning and trembling in her own pleasure as his tongue danced over her clit and his lips and mustache, and when he felt her tense with a powerful spasm, he went back to eating out her and taking a finger and slowly circling it around to the spot behind her clitoris. This added to the tingling sensation inside of her which had her arching her back and lifting her hips to meet his tongue, and soon she could feel he was getting very close. She knew that if he didn't stop, he had to have her first...</p> <p>"Oh yes...lover, fuck me now...fuck me" She begged him, "please don't stop!" He kept licking her clit furiously as her entire body tightened up and her whole body shuddered and shook, and she was having another powerful orgasm herself. He had to get away from her completely. He turned around, grabbed her around her waist and lifted her on his cock and was thrusting into her and was going straight through her climax for a second time. It was just a quick and easy fuck, and when he saw her go off again, he lifted her up onto the bed, got them into a spoon position, turned off the TV and put on a porn show on his laptop. The porn showed his cock and balls bouncing in and out of her hot mouth, and she was sucking and licking it like she had never done before.</p> <p>They stayed like that for a minute before he had to pull out to say good-bye. She was smiling at him, and he started to say something too, and then she heard him say, "thanks" and he left the room and went through another doorâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
