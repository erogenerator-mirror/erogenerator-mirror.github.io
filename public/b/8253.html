Sliding down the bed, his free hand wrapped around my left ankle, I felt him grip my right leg, pulling it out to the side, so that now he was knelt between my legs.</p> <p>The touch of his hand was soothing against my skin, not quite on my skin yet. I just turned my head slightly so he was staring at my face and saw him staring at me, taking in the sight of me. The pink tip of his tongue teased its way along its length, making me smile. "I like your smile," he murmured in my ear, "so, so, so pretty." He then licked it up again, and this time, his tongue flicked out and ran against the edge of my ear, making a sweet, yet pungent wet noise.</p> <p>I could feel myself start to lose all control as he reached back and ran his tongue back up my belly, making me arch my back ever so slightly, even more so as my panties were stripped from my body and laid on the bed by the door. His hot mouth was on the right side of it, and his tongue was flicking over my nipple, making me shudder. He took my right nipple into his mouth and nipped gently, then, when I was ready, he slid my right foot off the bed and held it away from me by the leg. He kissed the inside of my ankle and then continued his way up my thigh, his tongue going over my stomach, making me shiver in delight.</p> <p>Once his tongue went lower, still teasing my nipple with just the tip, his left hand began to rub up and down my leg, just short enough to feel the softness of skin. He then grabbed my hips and kissed his way up my inner leg, never touching the bare skin of my left thigh. As his lips reached the inside of my right thigh, I couldn't keep still. My breathing was heavier, and my heart was beating a mile a minute as I waited for what was coming.</p> <p>As his lips neared my panties, I could not believe how wet I was just watching him. "Oh god, baby," he whispered as his lips wrapped around my now damp panties, "I don't think I've ever come that hard in my life."</p> <p>His body pressed up between my legs, his hard manhood pressing up against me, his lips and tongue working on my body. I could feel the head of his cock pressing up against me, pressing against my wet slit.</p> <p>"That's it, baby," he said softly, "come for me, let me make you come."</p> <p>I didn't wait for him to get me to come as his lips covered the tip of my penis.</p> <p>"Unnnnnh," his lips found my lips and began to kiss my mouth, my tongue sliding back in between them, "I wanna feel you come, baby, but I don't think you'll like the idea of you coming in my mouth." His mouth pulled away from mine and he looked down at me. With a teasing smile, his hands began to stroke up and down my legs, leaving them a little apart, as he slid them down to my ankles.</p> <p>He smiled again as he pulled my legs back wide apart, giving him a clear view of my pink and wet hole. "Are you sure you're not excited baby?" he teased me.</p> <p>He leaned down and kissed my lips again, then ran his tongue up to the tip of my nose and back down. "Just go for it, baby. You know I will never stop coming for you."</p> <p>"Oh, fuck," I moaned gently. "I am going to come."</p> <p>He kissed me once again for a moment, and then grabbed my right ankle and pressed it against his lips, as he began to kiss and nibble on it, going down the inside of it, making me shiver in anticipation. While he kissed my ankle, he slid his hands over my calf and then up, under my leg, holding it and putting it up on my thigh, his warm moist breath caressing the bare skin before he began to kiss on it.</p> <p>"Oh god," I moaned, my heart beating fast and my breath coming in short pants, "please, baby, oh yesssss."</p> <p>I couldn't believe how erotic it was to experience this new thing in my life, not knowing yet any one else, but him in his own bed with me.</p> <p>"Baby, you're so beautiful," he murmuredâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
