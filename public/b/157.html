The doctor laughed as he turned to look at me. 'I thought if someone took this kit you'd end up being a little out of shape. Do we have some alcohol in the bottle?' I nodded and put my fingers in the pocket on the other side, and I held out the bottle to the doctor.</p> <p>'Drink it then, we need to give you a massage, no don't move' he instructed, pointing at my hands. 'You've been under plenty of stress haven't you?' I nodded again, I could tell he'd seen right through me. He reached out and took it from me. 'Don't move,' said the doctor, 'it'll help ease the tension you're under. Relax. If anyone takes this kit and wakes you up for whatever reason it'll be worth it...' I relaxed again. I closed my eyes and drank the coffee in one huge gulp and then my head, arms and legs began to feel a lot better.</p> <p>'Mmm, thank you doctor, now I can relax, feel your hand on the inside of my thigh....' I turned to face him, the pain still dull in my hips and back. 'And....' I glanced up, my eyes meeting his and then he smiled back at me, a smile that warmed me more than his. 'I have to ask....' I trailed off, feeling a surge of guilt surge through me again. I wanted to be good for John. I felt his hand gently rub my back. I felt his arm rest on my side. All too soon I felt the heat start to build. My head started to swim and I couldn't tell where I was at all.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>'So you're back from the bar scene now huh?' He questioned, putting his arm on my hip. 'I'm guessing you've had your massage....' He paused. I had to think fast before he got stuck again. 'Yes, yes,' he breathed and leaned forward, his lips brushing over my cheek. I looked at his face, he had a look of concentration and a little worry in it. I opened my eyes, looking up at him. 'Can I do something for you?' I said softly. He nodded his head. I turned my head to look at him. His face was a shade of light blue, not as tan as he liked it.</p> <p>'Anything,' I whispered. 'Anything.' He nodded once.</p> <p>'Ok, I can work on massage, if you want.' He said, standing up. 'Take this off.' I hesitated, he said, 'No, no, no, it's not necessary. I've just got to know, if I like.... If I'm gonna do this.' He said, looking at the bed. 'Look at the wall there, just follow me, there I'll show you....' He pointed to a small open space between the two beds on a far wall.</p> <p>I sat on the edge of the bed, facing the wall. I pulled the straps over my shoulders making the straps slide back, and I put my hands above my head.</p> <p>'Do this. It's just a way of helping you with that 'down there'....'</p> <p>I leaned forward, placing my hands on either side of the wall and slid the straps tight around my elbows. I watched as the straps slid against one another and down onto my breasts, leaving me totally naked. He knelt at the bed, and took my hands in his. He kneaded my hands together, squeezing my fingers and pressing them together. He pressed to my chest as I let him. He lowered his mouth over my right breast, and bit lightly at my nipple. I let out a muffled gasp, arched my body forward. My nipple hardened against his teeth. He sucked it in as he rolled his tongue around it. I felt an intense burning within in my thighs, I knew exactly how. I shuddered as I did. His fingers ran up and down my spine, over the curve of each muscle in my back, down to my lower back. I was going crazy.</p> <p>His fingers traced down and over my ass, making me arch again. He slowly massaged the outside of my pussy, dipping between my legs with his finger in my juices. I moaned. I felt a burning.</p> <p>'You've got a nice set...' he said as he lowered his body between my legs. He kissed my inner thigh, his mouth close to my shaved pussy. I gasped, my body tightening. His fingers traced down from my thighs to my upper thighs, brushing across the outer lips of my pussy. I shivered again. I felt the dampness in the air, it was getting hotter and hotter. My pussy was burning, all of it. I could feel the coolness coming through my legs on his skin, almost like Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
