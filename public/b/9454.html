As I had done a few times before, I bought a set of red velvet glasses and a selection of candles. After lighting one, I slowly approached the bed wearing a sheer dress that I was trying to keep a discreet distance from my roommate's boyfriend, so I could see the light as well. I had purposely worn a short leather skirt so that I could still give my roommate a flash of panties and cleavage without putting on a bra. I set the glass on the dresser in time with the music. After settling in, I began to dance slowly, moving my body slowly around the room, my arms wrapped around a small, yet voluptuous, female form. I turned to look over my shoulder as I played with myself, but I caught a quick glance down into my cleavage. I smiled to myself, realizing that one glance would not have made my underwear look better.</p> <p>As the evening wore on and the music played, I moved closer to a small bedside table and began to work on my vibrator that I had purchased just for the occasion. The sound of it gently making a noise as I slipped the top in and out, sending shivers through my body, made me almost come right there. The sounds from within as I began to flick the switch, was incredibly sexy, making me almost lose it right there on the bed, before taking it out and replacing it in its place.</p> <p>As I continued my play, I could not help but feel the warmth of my roommate's body next to me, as he continued to work on his hard cock. At one point he bent over my shoulder with a devilish smile, leaning down and licking around my ear, making me shiver. As my pussy got more and more excited, so did the feel of his cock head against my legs, my legs parted slightly. He took the vibe and placed it against his own head, as I spread my legs, opening myself slowly for him while he gently caressed himself. Soon my wet pussy was rubbing against his cock as he pressed it to himself and began to slide it in and out. His hand rested on my left shoulder as he did this, guiding me to move my hips back and forth. As my wet pussy rubbed the tip against my clit, I moved my hips back and forth faster, as the vib was now in my pussy. I heard myself gasp at the pleasure I created and then sigh as the vibrations sent me over the edge into a state of frenzy.</p> <p>My entire body seemed to respond to this sexual release, my entire body began to tingle as I could no longer control the building in the tip of my sex. I looked over my shoulder to take a look at what was happening but could not see anything. Suddenly, I felt something else than a vibe pressing against my pussy lips. My mind was filled with this new feeling, I was lost to thought that I was enjoying it so badly. Suddenly I came to realize that there was something that wasn't quite a vibe inside my sex. Something that felt just like a vibe. I reached down to feel my pussy as if it were real, my body seemed to be made of electricity, and it was like nothing I had ever felt before. I was in ecstasy as I felt the vibe being pressed against my entrance and then felt it enter a very tight, warm hole. I thought I just could not take the sensations as I felt the vibrations from within.</p> <p>As if my mind had become detached from my body, I couldn't feel a thing except for my mind. I could not see anything. I wanted to see how they were done, to feel what it was happening to me. "What is it that I want so badly?", I whispered to this stranger, but could feel the words coming from my own mouth out. A moment passed and I felt the vib go away as my roommate and I watched silently on the bed. I then looked up at him with a puzzled look.</p> <p>He was looking at me with that same mischievous smile, but now I felt something that it was too late, as he began to stroke himself.</p> <p>"Honey, I want you too", I said and felt my body react to the thought that the other person wanted to fuck my roommate at my place of pleasure.</p> <p>He looked at me with a naughty grin and said: "What else does my friend do to you?".</p> <p>I felt my body tense, as I replied him in a way that I never had before. I was having no intention of letting the situation get far from me.</p> <p>He started to move himself closer to me and grabbed me by the waist, pulling me close. My breasts were pressed into him as he began to kiss my neck and my lips. I felt my nipples becoming erect under his lips, as he moved his mouth against mine.
