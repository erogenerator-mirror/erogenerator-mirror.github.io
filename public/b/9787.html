I really have no time to be able to concentrate right now.</p> <p>"You don't realize how beautiful you look right now!" I announce, which she actually blushes, or at least I thought she did, especially since this is the very first time you've ever said that to her, and then added just then that I'm just the one who's got blue-eyes. She blushes deeply, and I swear to that God Almighty that she's going to do anything I tell her to.</p> <p>I move right into her again, this time slowly. She has a cute girlish smile on her face, but I know how much bigger it's going to get. That's why I love her so.</p> <p>"I'm sorry!" She says. "It's just so hard for me to watch you from a distance, but I guess I didn't realize how beautiful you were until now. "</p> <p>"I'll just try to keep my distance from you this time." And I put my hand on her left shoulder and squeeze. "So far, so good."</p> <p>She puts her hands on my shoulders. I move my fingers down her arms, down to the hem of her shirt and pull the shirt up and over her head almost to the waist. She's wearing a pretty pink cased bra today, just for me. I reach around and pinch her ass.</p> <p>She's not wearing a bra today either. Her smallish breasts aren't particularly big, and even though they're small they're still a nice handful.</p> <p>"That's nice. You have some really nice tits. Don't you think?" I murmur, and she smiles, like she knows something I'm thinking, and she doesn't know anything about what I'm thinking, but she's smiling ear to ear. "I love your ass, it's so round and firm when you walk, " I whisper to her, and she blushes again, though this time with a shy smile. "It was hard moving with you in those tight pants... I love your hips, they're nice curves there," I say, and she blushes again, but just as easily.</p> <p>I can see the blush spreading across her face. "I guess you didn't notice how I'm holding it, are you feeling excited?" I ask as I move my hands from her ass toward her breasts, then down her sides, and down to her hips, and to the small of her back and over her ass.</p> <p>"Yes, I do... but it's so good to finally get a piece of me, to finally be able to feel me, feel someone all over me, and I wish I had a way that I could do that for you right here..." she adds, and I turn my attention to her ass again.</p> <p>She still says nothing, but even more she's trying to keep herself together.</p> <p>I slide my fingers around each cheek, feeling how soft and squeezable she is.</p> <p>"Are you still wet? Did it just feel hard?" I ask her as I rub down the crack of her rear, and she giggles, but not in a loud way, just a sort of a moan, and her back stiffens.</p> <p>I slowly slide the index finger of my right hand down, just an inch, and back up to rub along her bottom again.</p> <p>"Are you going to try it again?" I ask as I do. She gasps. "What was that?" she asks again, and she doesn't answer though there's a slight gleam in her eyes.</p> <p>"What was what?"</p> <p>"The sound of me playing with your ass and your cock and your pussy."</p> <p>"That sounds fun. I'm kinda excited about it. It's fun to play with my friends when I'm doing... well, I'm kinda into it, you know? I get kinda excited."</p> <p>"You're not a virgin, are you? I've heard of you." I think, at least she doesn't want me to be some kind of dickhead for the next day, or anything.</p> <p>"No. I never tried to have anal." She says as I think, and then it dawns on me that she's not really a virgin, she just has a boyfriend who thinks he can't have a girl. That I think she doesn't want either one to know it.</p> <p>"Can I ask you something personal?" I ask her as I squeeze her ass again. "Did you ever... you know... have an orgasm?"</p> <p>She lets a little giggle bubble out, but doesn't answer me.
