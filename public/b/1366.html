As he did, he slid down to his knees. His fingers were still around her wrist, but now they moved up toward her shoulders, then back down her arm to her elbow, which he grasped as a handle, and began to move her arm. Within a minute of their foreplay, her arm was stretched upwards, and she was almost floating. He did this twice more before he was rewarded with a clear view of the lovely, white orbs beneath her brassiere cups. Her nipples were larger than I had imagined, and stood out at attention, the tips already peeking out for him to admire. He knelt once more, his fingers continuing at her sides, until they had completely encompassed her torso. He gently pushed her back again, and she was at last looking down at him, a flush creeping to her cheeks. With her arms still at her sides, her elbows locked together, she had a firm grasp on his shoulders. She gave him a brief kiss, and then pulled him against her. The kiss turned into something more, and he responded as if he could taste the sweetness of her lips on his tongue.</p> <p>He continued to kiss her, until she was nearly breathless again. She turned toward him and again the embrace became more passionate, but his arm still firmly grasped her wrists. As they continued to kiss, he let his fingers run up and down her arms, then back again. With each pass of his hand up and down, she continued to press her body against his, but then he pulled away, and she was once more completely at once exposed, but now only in the arms of this gorgeous man.</p> <p>While his hands continued to slowly explore, he looked up to say, "That was incredible," as he raised his head so that he could see the side of her face, almost to her hairline.</p> <p>"It was too."</p> <p>"Did you like it?"</p> <p>"Yes. The view, at the moment, was marvelous."</p> <p>"You like it?"</p> <p>"I did, very much, thank you. I'm surprised that a woman such as yourself would want to do something like that, especially with someone as nice as you," he said, his arm now back, reaching to cup her cheek as it laid across her side.</p> <p>His expression was one of relief, and she leaned closer to him with a hopeful smile on her face.</p> <p>"That's okay. I was just about to say that I loved it when the movie began and it looked like you did."</p> <p>"Then, I do."</p> <p>"I'm not very good at this, and I don't have much room for criticism. I may get some criticism," he said. "Just be a good lady and let me see what I can do to fix this. But, I can only say that it did turn me on to, you know, have another woman in my arms."</p> <p>"That seems to be what you wanted to say," she said coquettishly, her eyes never leaving his, and he could only nod in response.</p> <p>She looked as if her bottom lip might collapse.</p> <p>"My friends say that I, like a lot of men, like to be sexually stimulated, too. It's easy to tell by the way I look at it that I really do want you to do that. So, do it."</p> <p>"I did, but I also did something I never intended to do, and I hope you do too."</p> <p>"You do, do you think you're really a man?"</p> <p>"I've been dreaming of that for years."</p> <p>She gave his ear a light tap with her finger. "I'm glad."</p> <p>As they moved toward the door of the office, their lips never parted.</p> <p>When they reached it, they turned out the lights, and then he stepped back. He had a bit of a puzzled look to his face.</p> <p>"It's all right, it's really okay."</p> <p>"Well, I'm sure it will be okay, you know, but if I can't go right ahead, I'm not sure how to finish."</p> <p>"That won't be too hard."</p> <p>"It's just that, in our position, it seems natural at first to go this fast."</p> <p>"Well, why don't you sit down?"</p> <p>She sat on her stool, and he took the chair across from it. He leaned back against the wall and rested one arm across the upper part of his bare chest, with the other resting near his lap and resting in his lap as he remained reclined.
