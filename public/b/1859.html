"You're just like my daughter, if you were my son you wouldn't have to worry about your daughter's feelings," she joked.</p> <p>I smiled back at her and said, "Don't worry hun, you will soon see that it isn't so difficult for me."</p> <p>I kissed her on the nose then walked off to the kitchen. After I got some coffee brewing I grabbed a glass of orange juice and sat down on the couch to watch a game. As the doorbell started ringing just like a good Mom, the idea that we could be going out to eat with my son seemed real hot.</p> <p>I was starting to feel a bit like I needed to tell Mom that I knew she wouldn't be able to bear any more of this but I knew Dad would understand and I knew I would. We had to let them know we still had our plans for tonight and they would probably forgive us if we had anything to say to them.</p> <p>After the doorbell rang Dad's voice brought me back back to reality. "Is it ok Mom if he goes and sits with me on the couch?"</p> <p>"Be my guest," I said as I jumped off the couch and went to open the door. "Just leave me a little privacy, you aren't going to bite my head off are you?"</p> <p>"Of course not," he replied with a smile and smiled back at me.</p> <p>He was a handsome young man, he was in his early sixties, about 5'3" and 140 pounds. He had a very short plaid black hair cut short and just covering his ears but it was easy to see he had nice big brown eyes. He was a really attractive man so I felt pretty good that he was still in his early fifties and his smile showed an underlying confidence that made him quite a turn on.</p> <p>Dad handed me a drink and walked me into the kitchen. He took the drinks and poured me a big cup of hot coffee for myself.</p> <p>We sat there and talked for a while until Dad had a drink of the coffee I had just poured for him. It was a sweet and strong drink and Dad's eyes were locked on mine as we just sat there talking about nothing.</p> <p>I thought we were just going to be a pair of old friends chatting and laughing together like we did after all that time dating. After that several people left the living room and the two of us walked to the front door. We went upstairs to Mom's room to have coffee and relax a while and then went into Mom and Dad's room. They were both in the bathroom getting out their robes so I knew they would be naked underneath.</p> <p>Dad sat on the edge of the large overstuffed chair in the bedroom. Mom sat on the bed looking at me and I knew that she was turned on by what her son had seen and that her panties were wet and slightly stained with her juices. She had already taken her panties off and was starting to rub herself through the cloth of her panties.</p> <p>I heard Dad saying something that I wasn't sure when I walked into Mom's door and I knew that what he had said had to be his favorite thing in the world to say. I went back to the bed until the covers had dropped to my waist leaving me in only my light blue boy shorts and tee shirt. "I think we need to get out of here before we start getting the bed and breakfast set," Dad said.</p> <p>"Come join me on the bed, I am very nervous and I want to make sure everything is comfortable."</p> <p>I took a quick look around the room before I got up and followed Dad to the bed. As I stood there watching the two of them I just wanted to reach out and grab their arms but it felt really weird sitting in a room with nothing covering them.</p> <p>"I am so nervous," I said trying to appear unsure.</p> <p>Dad took off his robe then reached out and pulled me up until I was sitting on his lap. We just laid there for a moment letting our hormones take their time.</p> <p>"I know Mom, you really liked what happened last night."</p> <p>"I had a lot of fun doing it," she said with a smile.</p> <p>"Yeah I had fun it and your doing it a lot," he replied with a grin as he stroked my breast through the silk of my tee shirt.</p> <p>I reached down and ran my hands through Dad's hair then took it in my hand and pulled it slowly back and then forward. He didn't seem to hear my move but I felt his eyes on my back as they followed down to my body.</p> <p>"You still want some fresh air do you?" I asked as I watchedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
