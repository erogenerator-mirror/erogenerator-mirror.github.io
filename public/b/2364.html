"I have a very good reason for leaving you there," the man said to her, his hands still at her hips, his head still under the water, his eyes still on the spot.</p> <p>"And why would you do that, for such a long time?" the man asked, his body still at her side, hands gripping and squeezing her. "Why are you here," the man asked her, his chest moving up against her breasts. His body rested on hers, and they both felt the heat from the water between her legs.</p> <p>"We met in the middle of the desert," they both answered in the same breath.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" the stranger asked. He was lying on his back under the water; his hair had been wet and clinging to his head, but the water had dried. His skin had an olive hue, and his muscles looked hard. The only thing that was on his body was a thin black piece of cloth. He looked like a soldier on the cover of a newspaper. They were both dressed completely, except for the man's hands and hers. With the man laying on his back, she felt a powerful desire to press herself against him; to feel the powerful desire that was so hard to hide. It was a physical desire that she could not describe even for a brief moment, and she thought she saw a smile. At first it was from the man, at first it seemed so genuine, but as he watched her, he began to relax, his hand sliding down her stomach to her belly button and slipping between her legs.</p> <p>"You're not," he answered in a low voice, then his fingers had touched the tip of her mound, brushing her wetness through her skirt. "I'm not."</p> <p>"No," she breathed. When her voice did not respond, she saw him move and feel him. His hand pushed aside the fabric of her skirt, exposing her sex. She had been touched there before in the middle of her life, but he touched her there like a child, and her heart raced faster. She was wet again! She didn't see what was happening, and he didn't need to. It was natural to feel the heat and wetness of his hands. It had been the touch of another man, and it had been from another man. Maybe it was from another man! He continued to rub her.</p> <p>"You feel like you're on fire," he murmured, but he had no other intentions. His fingers had found her opening and slipped inside of it. If he didn't know better, he thought, she certainly felt wet inside.</p> <p>"I could get lost in there," he said in a low voice.</p> <p>"Where do you take me?" the mystery man asked gently.</p> <p>"You're somewhere else," he answered. "It's a bit far but I don't feel it." He felt like he was going to cry. This felt so natural, so right.</p> <p>"So long," the stranger added. "And I think you will. I think I'll like it here better, since tomorrow we start at square and get to know each other very well." The stranger's fingers had started a slow rhythm between her legs, and she moaned softly while he made wet, wet noises against her neck. "I'm not going to last very long in here," he added, his mouth at her ear. "It's been a long time for me, too. It's been my life since you left on your run. When we finally meet, I'll be with you. My body will be yours."</p> <p>Without even knowing what he was saying, she didn't answer immediately. Her breath came in hot little pants, and she had not felt pleasure of any kind as far as she could remember. It began deep and insecurities, not quite full-fledged emotions, but the emotion was there, a feeling of closeness. It was a feeling that she didn't want to feel again, and her hand reached up and pressed his face into her hair and pulled. It was all her, all her thoughts, her actions, the feelings of her heart, her desire, all of it was in his arms. She moved her hand away from his face, letting him take full control of her body, and she was completely at his command.</p> <p>His fingers began to stroke her more and more urgently, not leaving her body. Her breathing got short, deeper, and she groaned against his ear when her body went rigid. Her voice was low, but so clear, "I'm going to make you cum so hard, I won't last long. I want it --" She barely understood what she meant to say, but the feeling of her own body was so powerful again, and she wanted it. She felt like she was burning up with fireâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
