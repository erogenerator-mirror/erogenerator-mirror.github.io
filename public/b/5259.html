Her tone was confident and friendly - which she wasn't shy about.</p> <p>"Cricket! Your new friend from last fall?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she said as she looked around the bar. She was standing next to a young boy who just seemed to be a normal looking boy - at least.</p> <p>I got off the counter, walking quickly away from the counter with her, "Hi," I said. I could see that she was smiling in response as we walked by.</p> <p>"You seem pretty busy," she said with a smile as we got to her bar.</p> <p>"Yes," she responded as we reached her, "this isn't for anyone else, is it?" I nodded, smiling back with my usual friendly smile. "I can't think of anyone else I'd rather do for a single malt..." I nodded again, smiling back while she smiled a little more confidently.</p> <p>"I could show you something else," she said looking at the empty bar again.</p> <p>"It's late, let me get more ice water." I walked behind her as she grabbed two pitchers of water out of the fridge and pulled it across the bar. "Would you like me to get you ice water?" she asked, looking me up and down with a big smile on her face. I could feel my stomach drop a little more and she smiled at me a little wider.</p> <p>She walked back around to the counter and came back with the ice. After setting the bottles down on the bar, she picked up another bottle of water, filled it up with some ice and poured it back with several more minutes until she had filled the whole bottle up again. Then she took a bottle of ice again and set it down on the counter. By this time, I was practically drooling over the girl I was just chatting with and had just finished a couple drinks with before I'd really gotten down and dirty. This was going to be a great evening.</p> <p>Her friend came back after another couple minutes. I was surprised and pleased to see her, thinking that if I could just tell her who they were, they would know that I really was the guy that she had been playing with earlier. I was sure of one thing -- I knew that these girls were all sluts so to be honest, they wouldn't even mention it, if that's what you wanted to hear.</p> <p>She smiled at me as she walked over to the bar and handed me the bottle of water. "We're all sluts here." She smiled in return. "I didn't have any complaints. You seem to be very good at this," I smiled in return.</p> <p>"I'm a little busy at the moment," she responded and grabbed a glass of water. After she grabbed the bottle, her friend continued in her friendly voice: "I see you didn't take this drink earlier."</p> <p>It wasn't a comment. "I'm still finishing what I started," I answered sarcastically and walked to the kitchen to get another bottle. I set the glasses down and joined the girl that was sitting with the boys at the bar. Her friend was still smiling at me; she was holding the glass of water just as I had. She looked up at me and said something to her friend and the boys all in unison. Just as I was about to leave, she smiled again and started to move away, but the girl in front of my wife continued at my wife as a second woman came back to the bar. From nowhere I heard a faint click and what sounded like a giggle.</p> <p>A minute or so later, the guy at the bar was about to walk back to the table. I heard another giggle and the girl in front of me was making her way back. I took a sip from the glass that I was holding for what felt like a minute and tried to keep from being completely distracted. About halfway through the second second drink, I heard another click of the second woman's giggle. The sound changed almost instantly. My wife's friend laughed again. The third person that came to the bar was still smiling and smiling and talking softly to the bartender.</p> <p>I heard someone else's giggle and then her giggle changed again. I glanced at the girl at the end of the bar, who was still grinning to her friend, but had a sly look on her face. The guy at the counter looked at the third girl while the female bartender looked at the girl that was sitting next to him on the third person stool.</p> <p>The second woman at the bar walked onto the third stool in the opposite direction. I didn't immediately move my legs to come to rest at the stool across from them, so I waited until the third girl turned to walk back to her friend, who had left the stool. I had to look back toward the other bar at them to haveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
