I groaned loudly and pressed against her hand as she cupped it. I was in heaven. My wife's hand on my cock as she rubbed her fingers over it. I began to buck forward. We were both in heaven. The thought of having that wonderful big cock of hers inside me while she kneaded my cock was indescribably exciting.</p> <p>"Are you ready to cum?" I asked. She nodded her head and squeezed my cock. I began to slide out of her.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>I slid down on the seat. My breathing was heavy. I had my orgasm not long after my wife.</p> <p>"Cum. Cum." As my pussy muscles contracted, I heard a giggle. My thighs flexed and I pressed into her hand. The feeling of my hot creamy white hot semen deep inside her hand excited her even more. My fingers pressed into her shoulder while I rocked onto her hand. I felt myself begin to come. My legs shook. I felt completely empty. There was nothing left. I was completely spent.</p> <p>In my dreamlike state, I could still feel a familiar warmth spreading over my body. My hand fell onto my wife's lap. I reached down and caressed her gently. The feel of her fingers on my hand was all I remember.</p> <p>"Was it good?"</p> <p>"Oh, God yes." I said as I rubbed her hand. "Was that very, very good?"</p> <p>"Mmmm" She rubbed my leg. She smiled and kissed my cheek.</p> <p>"That was the best." I reached over and caressed her cheek, "I love you, too."</p> <p>"I should have just laid there and went to sleep."</p> <p>"Don't be silly. Not until you've had another chance to have a good orgasm," in my dream state, I felt her hand slide down my side and begin touching my breast. It felt so nice. I was feeling excited again. My husband was not as wild as yesterday.</p> <p>The next thing I remember to have was the feel of another set of arms over my head. I had not been aware of this till I awoke. The feelings were indescribably new and wonderful. My husband's voice in my mind. This was the very thing I wanted more and more. And now she could have been the one to have everything she wanted!</p> <p>I was still dreaming my first sexual experience with my husband. My fantasy had now been fulfilled while my wife was so happily fulfilled by her new lover. She was so beautiful. This was the new wife I had waited so long for and I had wanted her.</p> <p>We lay there for a while. After a couple of moments of quiet and peaceful feeling, I felt her legs around my hips. "How about we eat? Get out of that clothes. It's getting late and after last night, it's time to go. That is, after being with just you."</p> <p>"How?" I asked. I wanted to feel her in my dreams again, I wanted to feel her lips on my breasts. I wanted to feel and taste her lips all over mine.</p> <p>She smiled and shook her head. "You're just a little too fresh, aren't you?" I laughed and smiled back.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>After dressing in the clothes I owned, we went to our respective rooms to await our meal. We had some time before we had to get to work. We talked and laughed a lot. Not as much as usual but still very sexy and fun. There were two other couples there as well. One couple was a little older than me. It was nice to have them over as we ate. It was very easy to talk to one another as we listened to their stories. She was a good-looking blonde, very fit, well built. I just wanted to be closer to her, but knew I couldn't do that. We all knew that and I didn't think we could.</p> <p>I don't know if it really bothered me, but I was really attracted to Susan. It had to do with our relationship. It was not that our sex life was lacking. I wanted to explore her sexuality more. I wanted the chance to be intimate with her. I liked her a lot. I liked talking to her and she liked talking with me. I wanted us to be friends.</p> <p>It was easy to tell. Susan is smart and sweet. She isn't shy and doesn't have any hang-ups about being in any of my fantasies. It's a big difference that's why it's so easy to say. She enjoys what we've done in our lives. I think she also enjoys being close to me. Her kisses were soft and innocent. They were also not forced. They were nice and warm. And just like being a husband, I liked her to enjoy me for herself.
