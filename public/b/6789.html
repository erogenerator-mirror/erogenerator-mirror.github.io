I asked, concerned.</p> <p>"No. Not really. We're just having some issues."</p> <p>He pulled us back into the kitchen. The aroma of meat, potatoes... and a hint of the sweetest perfume.</p> <p>"You look... good," I lied again.</p> <p>His arm moved around my shoulder and we walked into the living room and flopped onto the couch. It wasn't as comfortable as the bed but we were still a good six inches closer. He pulled me up and down on him. My hand slid up his stomach and found his cock. He felt so good in my hand. He felt so good. His breath was hot on my neck.</p> <p>He pulled me down closer and his warm breath washed over me. His tongue flicked out of his mouth and licked at my earlobe. He slid down and his knees moved up my thigh. He cupped a fistful of my tit in a very small but firm grip and pulled on my nipple. The sensation sent shivers and jolts coursed through me. I felt his cock get harder. His hand slid around my belly and found my nipple. It was rock hard and poked straight out at him. His palm rolled and pulled on my nipple. I felt like a woman and a man. We were touching and caressing and exploring each others bodies.</p> <p>I felt him harden as he pulled away from me. I sat up and pushed my shorts down so my butt was exposed. I ran my fingers over my cock and found that it was slick. I pushed my shorts all the way to my knees.</p> <p>"Come here," I commanded. He dropped to his knees and moved his face to my cock. We kissed and my lips and tongue started to explore each others mouths. I felt the hair on his back and the smoothness of his cheeks as he moved closer. I pulled away and stepped out of my shorts. We both walked to the couch and sat down. I sat down next to him and he snuggled up against me. I was very aware of the way his crotch was straddling mine. I could smell the scent of him and the scent of our sex.</p> <p>"You're so wet," he whispered. I reached over and felt his cock. He was rock hard. I took his hand and placed it to my pussy. He pulled my hand to him and I moved it to his cock. He was still hard but I wasn't ready for that.</p> <p>"Are you going to fuck me and lick me too?" he asked.</p> <p>"No," and I pulled his hand up to my breast. He cupped one and gently played with my nipple. Our tongues fought back over each other. I could taste myself on his lips. He pulled away. I moved my hand down so he could better feel me.</p> <p>"Is this what you want?" he asked. I nodded. He pulled me closer to him until our lips met just at my shoulder blade. I felt his cock pressing down against my thigh. I felt his cock head rubbing across my lips. I felt his body against mine. I was breathing hard. The heat and the smell of the sex was overpowering. I pulled away.</p> <p>"Not yet," I lied. He didn't pull away. "Let me take care of you." I moved down to his cock. His cock was so hard and hard. He looked up at me and I pulled my fingers to the side. I opened my mouth and began to lick him. I licked and sucked at his balls and stroked him. His body tensed as I worked on him. Then I took him and began to lick the head of his cock. My tongue teased the tip of him. It felt so good to have his cock inside my mouth. I could see his body convulse as I licked him. I could taste his pre cum on my tongue as I took him in. I pulled back and looked him in the eyes.</p> <p>"I want to taste you," I whispered. "I want to take you in my mouth." I leaned down and took him in. His cock was so hard and hot as I took him in. I felt the weight of him go in. I sucked on his cock head and licked his pee slit. I moved off him and began to stroke him again. His hands came up to my tits. I stroked and rubbed them as I sucked him. He groaned as I slid my finger into his ass. I got it wet and moved it back. He pushed it in.</p> <p>I pulled back off his cock. It grew even harder. His cock looked even longer and thicker than it had looked at. I couldn't take anymore. His cock head came in contact with my lips. My tongue met his and I licked him. I licked and sucked him until his orgasm hit meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
