I will just tell you." He said, as he went to kiss my neck.</p> <p>I moaned into his mouth and held his head in my hands. He started kissing all around my collarbone and I pushed my tongue past his lips. I sucked hungrily on his bottom lip and I could feel his erection growing against the fabric of his briefs. I slipped my hands inside his pants and started rubbing his hard dick through his briefs.</p> <p>"Oh, God..." I whispered and then bit my lower lip. I bit down softly.</p> <p>"Oh shit! I didn't mean to bite you that hard. I just can't control myself."</p> <p>"Good!"</p> <p>With that I unbuttoned his pants and slid them down his legs to the floor. His dick sprang free, a thick, swollen bulge almost bursting at his underwear.</p> <p>Before I pulled up my top over my head and tossed it on the floor, I was on my knees in front of him. He helped me and then stood up, standing behind me, pressing his body tight against me. Feeling his hard cock rubbing against the small of my back and his firm hands brushing over my chest was turning me on like no one ever had. He took a step closer to me and I looked up at him and our eyes locked. Our lips locked with a heated stare. It had taken all my self-control to stop myself, but the intense heat of his kiss was driving me wild.</p> <p>I pushed his hands off of my chest as he started pushing down on my hips. His hard cock was rubbing against the small of my back as he kissed me deeply. I couldn't believe how turned on I was. Our kiss was passionate and so needy, but I couldn't stop myself from reaching between us and feeling his cock pushing against my thigh, still trying to break our passionate embrace. My arms were wrapped around his neck and I pulled myself tight against him. I couldn't remember when having it felt like that. I knew that I shouldn't be kissing him like this, but it felt so right to be in this situation and he seemed so ready for me.</p> <p>He pulled away from me again and I felt his hard cock pressing against my stomach as he stepped back for me to stand in front of him.</p> <p>"God, you're the best of friend. You're so incredible."</p> <p>"Thank you, thank you," I replied with my eyes locked onto his.</p> <p>"Well, you're the best of friends, but you shouldn't keep me waiting a whole day."</p> <p>I smiled and nodded. "I think I'll be your best."</p> <p>He smirked, as he stepped to me, his hand snaking its way down my back. "You might just be my best."</p> <p>I took his hand and walked with him over to the couch in the living room. I sat down, and he took the couch with him. I stood next to his arm and I looked deep into his eyes. He knew exactly what I wanted. I turned my head and slowly sank into my spot in front of him. I moved back and forth slowly letting my eyes run up and down him as my fingertips started to trace the outline of his cheekbones. I leaned forward and closed my eyes, my lips kissing his stomach as I continued slowly, my tongue caressing his flesh.</p> <p>My hands were on the back of his neck and one hand ran up slowly to grip his ass. I felt his soft skin against my fingers as I pulled his body firmly against mine. My hand started to move over his flat stomach and I felt him shiver against me. He closed his eyes and moaned softly. I moved my mouth over as well and started to kiss his chest slowly. Just touching his skin with my lips sent a shiver through me. I felt his chest against my chest. I moved my hands towards his face and found the top button on his shirt. I started kissing the right spot where two buttons meet. I could smell his skin. I kissed all over his chest just once and he groaned in response. I moved again, and the next button flew open and his shirt fell open to reveal a pair of dark skin-toned black boxer briefs. I had never seen such a sexy sight. I reached out and pulled the briefs down his legs and off of them, releasing a pair of thick, long and thick black cock. I was about to lean in and kiss it when I felt a slight pressure at my neck.</p> <p>"You shouldn't have done that," I heard myself saying, "it's not the right time."</p> <p>My lips were suddenly gone, to a moan as I saw it in his eyes. I took his cock inside my mouth and gently wrapped my lips around it. I gently rolled it around in my mouth, my tongue darting out to taste him.
