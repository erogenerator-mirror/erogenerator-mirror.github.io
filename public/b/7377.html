But I'll tell you who I think is better."</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>Liam smiled and put my glass back on the table.</p> <p>"There is that. Don't you think we need to talk about this now?"</p> <p>Andrea didn't answer but her eyes went to Liam, her eyes were cold and she nodded.</p> <p>"Fine. Come here. I'll finish up here and we can continue what we said we would."</p> <p>Liam was a little uncomfortable with this, it gave him a break from any normalcy, but he didn't argue. He could deal with her being quiet around him, she's usually nice, and if they were alone they would be able to make it work.</p> <p>Andrea walked in, looking nervous as usual.</p> <p>'What's up?' she said as she stood up and looked at Liam. "Well, we have to talk, you know? If this is going to be a one time thing we should make it permanent."</p> <p>Liam's eyes widened, so was she.</p> <p>"I...oh God," she stuttered. "Yes. Yes. It would be fine, it would be fine."</p> <p>"Him," Liam said in a small voice. "Me too."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Just let it go. Now leave."</p> <p>Andrea sighed, she was scared, she wasn't sure if Liam would ever trust him again. She wasn't sure how to react, would this actually work. She couldn't tell him that she liked it if they weren't going to. Her heart began to pound, she couldn't stop it, not if she didn't do anything. Her hands were in her lap, Liam's eyes were locked on her. Liam was smiling at her through his lashes, a small smile she couldn't tell what he thought was on his face. She couldn't tell how to respond so she just stood there watching him try to hide the smile, hoping this wasn't going to mean anything.</p> <p>"Liam, don't do this."</p> <p>He shook his head.</p> <p>"Him. Me too."</p> <p>Andrea's heart began to beat wildly as she tried to get a hold of herself, trying to get her mind from racing at the thought of Liam. "What did you mean about being with him?" Her voice was a squeak and Liam seemed to sense it, he leaned closer to her and they sat down.</p> <p>"It's not just for fun."</p> <p>She felt her blood turn to fire and tears began to run down her face.</p> <p>"Come on. Let's talk," said Liam.</p> <p>Chapter 8.</p> <p>Liam had gone for a walk and was walking in the door when he saw Andrea in the kitchen.</p> <p>"What happened?"</p> <p>"Oh, it's not complicated. Listen, what I think is going to happen is that we're going to have a fight."</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"Oh, I don't think that. All we need is a lot more of a fight."</p> <p>"But what if I don't like how it sounds?"</p> <p>"Him, I don't think that either, you would feel good about yourself."</p> <p>Andrea hesitated. Was she about to let him think that, would she actually do something like this?</p> <p>"Just let me finish this drink."</p> <p>She had finished up his drink, she needed another.</p> <p>"Liam, listen... it's complicated. The one time I think I will ever be able to trust myself again will be when I wake up next to you from a nightmare. And I can't do that to you."</p> <p>"Hm, don't you even think I can forgive you?"</p> <p>Andrea hesitated. She wasn't sure how she felt about what Liam and she had done, she wasn't sure if Liam had done the right thing in trying to be with her.</p> <p>Just then the door bell rang, and Liam looked at Andrea, her face contorted with worry. He nodded to her, a smile on his face. Liam went to answer the door, turning to open it, saw Andrea looking at him with pleading eyes.</p> <p>When Liam stepped away from the door, he went to the open door and stood there for a second.</p> <p>"I think that's it."</p> <p>Andrea's heart sank, she wasn't really sure what to do. She could've done anything to try again, Liam wasn't going to be angry with her.</p> <p>"Liam." She turned to him with a soft look.</p> <p>"Wait."</p> <p>He looked at her again, she had tears in her eyes and she was leaning against the front door step with a shaky hand, a tear rolling down herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
