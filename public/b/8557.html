He felt as though he was fighting a losing battle and couldn't think of anything better to do but finish. He slowed down then, enjoying the sensation. He slowed until he was not going to stop. Then he slowly pulled nearly all of the way out, just the tip. He slid all but the shaft back into her then and she let out a gasp. He could tell she had been crying.</p> <p>With a smile on her face, she started moving her hips from side to side, trying to take him as deep as she could. Her hands were on his chest, pulling his hair, pulling him on top of her. She lifted her hips in time with him and the friction brought him quickly to the end of his first thrust.</p> <p>She felt him start to swell, she felt the wetness of his cock being swallowed against her cervix. She moaned, "Oh god, Yes, Oh God! Fuck yes! Oh! Oh! That's feels so good."</p> <p>"Oh God!" He said. "I'm going to come in you! Oh baby you feel so good! That's it. I'm going to fill you up up! Oh you are so tight! Yeah! Oh, yeah! I going to fill you up!"</p> <p>He was starting to lose it as he continued to fuck her. His body was starting to tense. She was beginning to feel it too with her own, she felt it getting stronger and as it built to a crescendo, she tightened and her pussy squeezed his cock in response. He let out an animal-like grunt and he came. It felt like every single drop of his cum went into her womb.</p> <p>They lay there for a few minutes afterwards, totally spent. They kissed, she ran her hand through his hair as they kissed. Then he got up off the bed and went up the stairs out the door, then went back and grabbed a wash shirt for her. He looked at her. "I'm a bit worn down," he said. "You go change out here."</p> <p>He couldn't argue with her. Not a bit. She was his, that much was sure. He watched her walk out the front door, and he was thinking he loved her.</p> <p>He turned the corner to the entry way. She was putting the food on the table in front of the TV. He came up behind her and put his arms around her waist, "I love you."</p> <p>She turned around in his embrace, "I love you," she said, in the same breath.</p> <p>"I love you too," he said softly. He walked over to her and slipped his hands around her neck, pulling their bodies together. He moved them to the kitchen and put it into the refrigerator. He opened the door and made some drinks and grabbed another chair.</p> <p>He pulled her into the bedroom and laid down on the bed, pulling her down with him. They were holding each other in a deep, long kiss. Then he sat up on the bed and she was on her knees with her head between his legs. Her hands were running over his cock, making it harder than it had ever been. She was sucking on it with her lips, taking it all in. She looked up at him with a hungry, lust filled gaze and he could tell she was getting him really hard again. He pulled her mouth off his cock and sat up in the bed and pulled her to her feet, leading her by the hand to his bed, and they went back to the living room.</p> <p>He sat down as she sat on the edge of the bed, then looked down at her. "Let me get that for you," he said, and kissed her on her forehead. He kissed her hair, then down to her mouth, "I am going to teach you so much. Teach all of the right buttons to go into that beautiful mouth. Make it wet with your spit and then it'll slide in very easily. Put your arms around my neck, and then go back between my legs so you can concentrate on me."</p> <p>He watched her come back toward him, her eyes never leaving his as she slowly opened her mouth and started to suck, just lightly so his cock stayed hard. He sat back, took her by the shoulders, held her tight against him, and watched her do her best to keep him interested in something other than her lusty little show.</p> <p>It had been a very long time since he'd been so turned on by the same thing. It had been weeks since he had done it with anyone but his wife, and he wasn't sure he could get enough of this. He got off the bed and turned the lights off, leaving the small bedroom to be for him alone. He walked back to where she was sitting in front of him and knelt before her.
