It was a very difficult thing to be doing to a strange woman, and she had a pretty good idea of what would happen next. Her nipples seemed to swell slightly as she imagined that tongue. The first thing that occurred to her was how it felt to have a strange woman touching her bare breasts and nipples as she lay there. That didn't sound very erotic. She had never touched herself there before, and certainly hadn't given head before, but somehow it felt new. She just didn't want to start with that.</p> <p>She looked at the clock. "Let's get moving. There will be time enough later tonight, and it has been several hours. It will be interesting to see how you handle this," she said as she continued squeezing and massaging her right breast.</p> <p>He got up and went to his office, then came back, grabbed her by the arm, spun her around, then began to rub all over her naked body. He unbuttoned her blouse, slipped it off her shoulders and pulled it off. She cooperated with the buttons, revealing a nice set of breasts that hadn't gotten much sun that day anyway. She had to admit to herself that she looked good, and it helped that her nipples still stood proud. The only problem was that they needed to be sucked some.</p> <p>He took them into his mouth, sucked and nibbled them while his hands groped her ass and legs. They didn't have much action while he was on top of her. He was making short work of her nipples, then slid a hand up her side and over her skirt. He slipped his hand into her panties and started to finger her pussy.</p> <p>She was wet, and had to concentrate hard to stop herself from cuming in his hand. He continued rubbing himself, then slid his pants down and pulled his cock out. He took his cock in his hand and began to stroke himself too. He let her feel just what her body was getting from his touch as she reached over with her free hand to feel his cock.</p> <p>She couldn't believe how good his hand felt on it. Every time he stroked it it would start to get harder, and there would be a wet spot on the sofa that she wanted his dick inside of. He was so hot, and it showed.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum," he said in a hoarse voice as his hand continued sliding up her thigh.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I don't want you to cum in me. That would be bad."</p> <p>He stood up. "We must hurry, I need to finish off before anyone comes in," he said as he pulled back the sofa cover-off.</p> <p>When he looked at her, her mouth dropped open. "I never thought we'd do this," she said breathlessly.</p> <p>"Well, I do have one little favor," he said with a smile. "I want your mouth on my cock right now. You might want to help yourself too."</p> <p>He removed her jacket and skirt, and laid her over her desk chair with her legs and arms wide open, his face buried in her naked crotch. She spread her legs as far as she could, then started to arch her hips off the seat to meet his tongue as it moved around her pussy. He was very good at it, and got her as excited as he did her.</p> <p>"Oh, John," she shouted quietly. "Oh, yes, just like that, just like that." She started moaning with each passing wave of his tongue. When he moved his mouth lower she grabbed his head and pulled him up, hard, so that her feet were on the edge of the desk. She began pushing against his face, humping her crotch up against him as she felt herself reaching an orgasm. He put his arms around her legs for support, then lowered his mouth back to her pussy. He put an arm around her waist as he held her. He moved his mouth over her opening. She felt her juices coating his face as he licked her, tasting her pussy. She came at last. That felt terrific!</p> <p>When she had finished her orgasm, she got up to sit on the edge of the desk. He came back up after she did. "You did it again," she said, looking over at the clock again. He sat down facing away from her, his face just inches from hers.</p> <p>"It's your fault," she said. She was feeling hot, and a tingly feeling in her pussy. She leaned down and kissed his cheek. "It's my fault," she said again.</p> <p>"So, we can fix the problem?" he said as he got up and came around and sat next to her. "If we can, I'm not sure that I can stop it."</p> <p>"Maybe our problems will beâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
