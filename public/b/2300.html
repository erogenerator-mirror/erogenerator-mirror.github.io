Do you mean it? Do you want me to make you cum?"</p> <p>She could only nod her answer in a breathless whisper.</p> <p>He stood up and moved her skirt up and began to unbuckle his belt.</p> <p>"I won't hurt you," he promised.</p> <p>"Do you want to play with my clitty?" he asked.</p> <p>Without saying a word he moved behind Terri. She could feel his erection pressing against her. Moving in closer, he grasped his throbbing cock and brought it towards her. He wanted her to think that he was going to fuck her just like him.</p> <p>Without much of any hesitation Terri placed her hands on his chest, moving him closer to her. Her hips lifted towards him. She leaned back and opened her legs to facilitate his eager cock. Then again he stepped forward and entered her.</p> <p>Terri was glad she was wearing no panties because she was so wet she almost could feel him thrusting against her.</p> <p>He pushed himself towards her until their thighs met. Then slowly he pulled himself almost out of her. Then he thrust back in.</p> <p>The feeling was indescribable. She had never been penetrated so deeply before. It was like she didn't even know how she got there.</p> <p>Then he stopped thrusting altogether.</p> <p>"You know where the rest of me is? Do you want to feel me inside you?"</p> <p>"I . . .I don't . . ." she stammered.</p> <p>"You know it?"</p> <p>"I can't feel much," she replied</p> <p>"I can hear the sound of your heart pounding in your chest," he said quietly.</p> <p>Terri pushed herself against him and felt his cock pulse inside her.</p> <p>"I'm about to cum," she whispered</p> <p>He nodded and pulled himself from her. She felt his hand close on her breast. Then he began to gently squeeze.</p> <p>"No," she groaned. "That wasn't so good."</p> <p>"Yeah, but I knew it could be," he said and brought his lips to hers.</p> <p>He returned the kiss.</p> <p>Terri could taste herself on him. She knew there was no way she was going to let that happen again. She wanted it to be over quickly and as quickly as possible. The only question was, how would he react when she discovered herself again? She'd never felt this way. Not only had they made love, but they were lovers.</p> <p>She felt his kisses growing more intense. She was aware of her desire to be touched and controlled. She realized that she was becoming increasingly aroused.</p> <p>He moved her to her back and lay down on top of her. Their lips parted and she began to breathe heavily.</p> <p>"I'm sorry if I made you feel a little uncomfortable," he said.</p> <p>"I know, it's just . . .you were so . . . intense," she whispered.</p> <p>He kissed her again and then began to tease her with his tongue. She could taste the salty taste of herself in his mouth. She was wet between her legs now. She wanted more.</p> <p>His erection was pressed against her stomach.</p> <p>Terri reached down to rub him. When she felt him press harder against her she groaned. "Yes . . .yes," she pleaded.</p> <p>His erection had only gotten harder now that he was kissing her. He began to move against her. He began to slide between her legs, but never did he have the decency to go slowly. He slowly began to kiss his way up her side, kissing her cheeks and neck. He reached the curve of her breasts and began to suck a nipple into his mouth.</p> <p>"Oh God," she moaned in frustration.</p> <p>He slowly began to trail kisses down her chest. Then he reached the waistband of her panties and began to tease her pussy by lifting her tights up over her legs and exposing her bare pussy to his touch.</p> <p>Terri had been wet before when she made love to Eric. Now it just seemed the natural thing to do. She hadn't even had a climax yet to save herself, and she realized she was in need of a release at this point. She wanted to cum.</p> <p>He slipped a finger inside her pussy. She thought she would burst.</p> <p>"God, I've been wanting this so much," she whimpered.</p> <p>He rubbed his hand over her clit, causing her to gasp in pleasure.</p> <p>"What is it?" he asked as he began to lick her breast.</p> <p>"I want you to make me cum," Terri saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
