He smiled broadly. "Now if you will excuse me, I have some shopping done and I have to go." There was a slight pause. He was aware that she was naked, he had to assume she was.</p> <p>"Okay. Well, I have been getting so hot for you. I want to suck you, I have to...I want to...." The words were barely audible, but she made it sound so damned enticing. "I'm gonna...I'm gonna suck you!" There was a pause.</p> <p>"No, no.."</p> <p>"Oh my. You're so young!" She laughed nervously, a little embarrassed by the way her words were making her feel. "You just keep your clothes on, I think you'll do fine." It was just one sentence, she thought to herself. She wondered what to do with her hands, she thought it was really getting annoying.</p> <p>"And I'm going too!" She giggled at her own joke and turned around so he could get a good look at her naked ass. He could see that it was very firm and the firm cheeks were smooth. He wanted to lean forward and grab them but she didn't seem to want to, rather he kept his hand between his legs as he bent forward so he could reach. Finally it was his turn to gasp in surprise, but he managed to hold himself still.</p> <p>She smiled and moved a little closer, making sure her breasts moved with hers. His penis went rock hard and throbbing. They were just inches apart from each other. He looked around, there weren't as many places.</p> <p>"Let's go!"</p> <p>She walked ahead of him and he had an idea. They went to one of the back rooms and undressed, she stripped of her clothes in the center of the small room there. He undressed too. They didn't go all the way to the front room, he didn't want an audience. She turned toward him and pushed him down into the chair, standing just a few feet in front of it.</p> <p>"Is that better?" She asked, sitting there in just panties and heels. She ran her fingers through his hair and let him hold his head up.</p> <p>"God yes!" He moaned. "I didn't think it could go that far."</p> <p>She laughed and reached out to unclasp his shoes but he didn't let her help him. "No, there's a lot more." She leaned toward his ear and whispered breathily. "But I think you'll have a turn later." She reached around him and ran her fingers through the front of his underwear, pausing to stroke his very hard erection.</p> <p>"Wow." He thought to himself. "I think that maybe I'm going to have a good time too. I can't wait to get up to my room." He looked around and saw that some of the doors were closed but he didn't care or bother to check. It was his turn to be excited. The room he was in would probably have people staring at him from both sides anyway. He could almost feel the eyes on him.</p> <p>"Do you want me to undress for you now?" She asked. He nodded his head yes and she reached back around him. His erection was almost at full mast as she slowly unbuttoned his pants.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" It was almost a pleading voice.</p> <p>"Uh huh!" He looked up through his legs and saw her looking down at his erect penis. The shaft was thick with veins, the head was even darker, and it was swollen and red. She licked her lips and his penis throbbed even more. She reached around and unclasped her bra, it fell to the floor as if it hadn't been there. She leaned in closer and wrapped one of her hand around his penis. He felt the soft warm skin and let his head fall back slightly.</p> <p>"I've been wanting to do this to you all day." She slid his underwear to the floor and then stepped back. She was smiling, she was so turned on, it was like an out of body experience. She reached out and stroked his cock. She liked the feeling it had and liked the way it felt in her hand. She pulled it to the side and looked at it for awhile. It was smooth, covered with no telltale stains, and glistened in her hand.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful." He whispered as he stared at her, his mouth hung open slightly.</p> <p>"So are you." She smiled and reached over and ran her finger into his hair. "It's been ages."</p> <p>"And it's time."</p> <p>She walked over to him and straddled him. His erection rubbed up against her thigh as they swayed to the music. She leaned forward and they kissed deeply.
