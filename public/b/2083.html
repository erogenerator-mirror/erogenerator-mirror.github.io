"Are you sure that would be too difficult?" she asked.</p> <p>"I just thought you and I got so worked up over this guy, but that's all." I said, trying to change the subject so she wouldn't feel bad. "I'll bet he's all yours in bed."</p> <p>"I guess I still don't feel too comfortable with you dating one woman!" She said, a little defensively.</p> <p>"Hey, we don't have to go to a party just yet, we're already having a great time!" I said, laughing. "I mean, I feel so much better about the whole thing now."</p> <p>"Me too! I'm glad that it ended in a good fucking!" She snorted, wagging her finger. I laughed along with her.</p> <p>After a few minutes spent on the computer, Tina got up to use the bathroom. I was busy making sandwiches, when she came back with a steaming mug of hot chocolate. "I'm surprised you're back so quick! I was looking for something to drink, you know."</p> <p>"Yeah, well, I'm fine!" I teased.</p> <p>"I thought you might." She said, taking a sip, a smirk crossing her lips. "You better go and change out here and use that shower. I need to get myself something to eat."</p> <p>"Sure, you sure you want to spend the afternoon in the shower?" I asked. "You're not too grossed out if I'm not in there."</p> <p>"There isn't anything gross about this is there?"</p> <p>"Not at all!"</p> <p>Before she could respond, I came into the kitchen and handed her a cup of coffee. "You can't go in naked, I can't shower with you."</p> <p>"Thanks, I guess." She said, her eyes on my shorts. Then she grinned and gave me a kiss and headed to the shower area. I finished making a sandwich and poured some more hot chocolate for her. When she turned around, I set the food back in the fridge and joined her in the bedroom.</p> <p>I poured us each another cup and she was a bit frazzled. I wrapped my arms around her waist and drew her even closer. It seemed like an eternity, though it really felt like a few hours. I was still amazed at the changes I had experienced when this gorgeous creature settled on top of me in the shower.</p> <p>"Can I ask something personal?" she asked, breaking the kiss.</p> <p>"Of course, of course, anything!" I laughed. "Go ahead."</p> <p>"Is something wrong?" she asked, sounding concerned.</p> <p>"Uh...well...I was wondering...um...do you...do like it with guys?"</p> <p>"Sure. I do. It's not a big deal if I tell you, but I really wasn't expecting it to be this weird." Her eyes were filled with concern.</p> <p>"So you do like me." I said defensively.</p> <p>"Oh I liked you!" she said with a giggle. "Why?" she laughed.</p> <p>"Because you're the most beautiful and sexy little thing in the world!" My words came out at a shaky level and I almost lost control. "I don't know if this is a great time of my life but I sure want this to end. When would we last? I've never had so much fun in as long a time, but I know I'm never going to stop being pretty if we never end up having that wild sex...this whole thing...this thing happening."</p> <p>I could feel her relax against me as I started to say something, but before I could she got up and turned over on her stomach. She raised her bottom and I moved in behind her. I began to rub her bottom gently in response to my words, trying to ease her conscience about what her body thought or me was thinking. But I could feel her starting to tense up again. When she did start to get serious about something, it looked like she was trying to reason with me.</p> <p>"If you don't want me to stop, you better stop that." I said softly while I placed my hand on her upper back. It felt like I was slowly stroking her arm while I was staring into her eyes.</p> <p>"I really like it!" she gasped as I moved my hand in an up and down motion on her back.</p> <p>"I told you I would!" I said in reply. It seemed a bit odd but she wasn't having much of it. At least not to me.</p> <p>"But...what about...oh! You don't like me...oh!...or like you wanted it...oh!...nooo!" She gasped, trying to get control of her fears. Unfortunately I was having to give her my best for the momentâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
