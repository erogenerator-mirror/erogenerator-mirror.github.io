He spoke as he held her to him for some time. She became aware of his hard cock pressing against his trousers and she tried to pull away in case she ran into the bushes.</p> <p>'You have a lot of nerve,' he laughed. 'Go and lie down.' He pulled her to him and kissed her and she became aware that some softness might come to the end of the kiss. He broke the kiss and pushed his lips against hers and she responded to his gentle pressure with a kiss that was full of desire. He rolled to his side leaving the hand free to explore her body. She slid to the chair across the room where he sat back with a glazed expression of lust. He lifted her dress slightly and took out his throbbing erection and slipped it in her pussy for a few strokes. He felt her juices run down his cock to mix with her own and she started to buck her hips against him.</p> <p>'Oh God, I could come just watching you,' he gasped. 'Fuck Me,' she growled, bucking her hips wildly as he pounded into her.</p> <p>'Yes, yes yes,' she screamed. 'I'm going to come!' 'Oh yes.' His breath was ragged as he thrust into her one last time and he exploded, spasming as it happened in her.</p> <p>He collapsed back in the chair, panting and shaking from the effort of the day's events, enjoying the feeling of her pussy around his softening dick. She pulled down the straps of her dress and put her bra away from her breasts.</p> <p>They lay together for some more time before he asked her what she wanted to do now.</p> <p>'Get undressed and put my knickers on,' she said as she lay on the arm of the couch. "Now my skirt and blouse," she added.</p> <p>"Can you come back and get them?"</p> <p>She laughed "Yes, of course I can," she said as she slipped off her underwear, and lay down on the couch naked. He returned carrying a pile of clothes and said, "Hang on, get the stuff first." She moved to go to the door as he pulled his trousers down. "Don't worry, I'll look after it." She smiled as she sat up. "What does it cost?"</p> <p>"Don't worry, I'll pay it for you," he said, and sat on the armchair at the end of the couch. "How long until your next appointment?" he asked.</p> <p>"About twenty minutes," she replied.</p> <p>He smiled. "I want to look at the new housework before your next appointment." She nodded. "Hang on," he said and stood up. She followed him down the stairs and out into the sunlight pouring through the window.</p> <p>'We'll get it. That's what I wanted to do. When we finish here, there will be nothing else. There will only be sex!' he thought, as he walked along the path to the large walkway that led to the house. "We'll be well in the car and it will be safe to go," he promised her.</p> <p>They stopped at the first house for coffee as he opened her door to the new home. She felt his eyes as she stepped into the house. It was larger than her flat had. It was furnished with a large double bed and a coffee table to one wall.</p> <p>"You are beautiful," he said. He turned and held out her hand to a surprised expression on her face. "I was just thinking, how could a man, like you, expect me to be as beautiful as you are when we are together?" She laughed breathlessly. "You have no idea how lovely you are. I can't think of anybody with that much of a heart."</p> <p>A long hard look and a look of surprise came over her face. "I think so," she replied. "I am happy with whatever it is, I really feel so happy. I just need to let nature take its course and I have no regrets about being so happy, at least in this moment with this man. You just seemed to want to spoil my life. I really don't know what to make of that, but if we go through this house again, I will have my heart set on your beautiful body, and you have nothing to fear!" As she spoke her eyes were on his cock and she felt herself get wet. "Come on in and we'll discuss the housework and then we can sort ourselves a little later," she said as she took his hand and stood him in the doorway. She was aware that now her clothes were clinging to her like a second skin. In any case, she had decided that she wanted to experience what he did to her, but she knew that it might be best to let things develop first.</p> <p>Later, he hadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
