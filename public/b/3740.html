"Mom, did you find anything?" he asked and her face got a little more intense as she nodded.</p> <p>I heard her breathe out slowly as she tried to collect her thoughts.</p> <p>"I'm not sure," she finally answered, "You should try this with Mike."</p> <p>"Thank you," I said and I pulled my hand back out. My hand started rubbing and I looked over at Mike and he gave me that same stare and smile. I took this to mean he had found something and would follow my lead.</p> <p>"Mike, come here and give me a hand," I said as I pulled him toward the bar. When he got closer, I could smell his familiar scent. It was the musky and fresh smell of his sweat mixed with the scent of a woman's pussy. He leaned in, his nose right in my crotch and I could feel a small twitch in his groin that I knew was from my juices.</p> <p>"What's that on your nose?"</p> <p>"Honey, smell it," I whispered and I leaned in and took a long, deep whiff as my hand started to massage the head of his massive, hard cock as it strained against the material of his trousers. Without any further conversation, we both stood up and walked back to the table where I could see and feel my husband's hands moving closer to my pussy while he watched the action with great interest and I felt the stirrings that his hand would make as it neared my lips.</p> <p>"Mom, you're going to have a baby," Mike said after we sat down and I looked up at him in anticipation. I could see the expression on his face as he reached up and pulled me closer to him and he leaned in and gently kissed me on the lips. He was not the same he was two minutes ago but he was still my son's sweet son. I wanted to taste him and taste his son and that's the thing right there. It was something that would have made me happy for many years to be able to do that.</p> <p>"Mhmm," I murmured as my lips parted to allow him access while I placed my hand on the nap he sat on and his eyes never left my own. There was no one else on the planet and the only one he could see on the menu was him. He smiled and pulled his hands away, allowing my lips to trail against his. His fingers were long and thick in my hand and they felt so good on my own. I brought my hand up and slowly brushed down his chest and stomach before pulling back slightly to rub my face in his belly. It felt so good and I hoped my son couldn't see the look of passion that was in my eyes.</p> <p>"Do you think this is going to be good for you son?" I asked, looking up into his eyes. It certainly appeared as if Michael was thinking the same thing as he began to unzip the rest of his pants and slide down his boxers which, as expected, were fully soaked with his precum which he was sucking off his fingers as he leaned in and kissed me once more. We hadn't even made love in the ten years we lived together. Not even on that first night, even when we were in bed, and now the night was going to be even better than we could ever be.</p> <p>"Mom, that's wonderful," he replied as his hands cupped my head and his lips pressed gently to mine in what would have been a loving gesture if the situation hadn't been so crazy. The man who was fucking a woman in my living room had just told me that he wanted me to feel that way and I wanted him to feel that way. My son's hands were strong and strong and I was a willing participant too. Our bodies were so much like one another and I felt his cock throb inside of me as the pressure of his kiss became more of a need than anything else in his life.</p> <p>My eyes locked onto his and I lowered my head and our lips were locked together in a passionate kiss that caused the air in the room to get sucked into the table. Our hands stayed on each other's backs as our tongues wrestled in our mouths. I felt his hands go down my back and grasp my ass just below my dress. He wasn't trying to force me and rather I felt his fingertips trace slowly, ever so slowly, across my flesh causing my pussy lips to swell and contract.</p> <p>I raised my hands to his chest and held his face as his tongue explored my mouth. I felt my nipples start to stiffen as our bodies were being pressed together. I could feel the heat of his body and the hardness of his crotch as weâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
