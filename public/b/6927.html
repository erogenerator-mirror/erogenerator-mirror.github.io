She nodded her head.</p> <p>"But you don't know how," I added.</p> <p>"No, but I am there with you," she replied. "I am all I'll say about you now." This time she moved closer and leaned against me, letting her legs open around mine. I moved my hand up under her shirt. She held me there and held me tight. I could feel her heart as she began to move against my body, letting her body heat move against my cock, slowly.</p> <p>"So?" she asked.</p> <p>"This is fun," I said. "I don't usually get to do this."</p> <p>"I'll keep you tonight," she said. "I don't want you out the way." She stood and began to unbutton my shirt. Reaching inside her bra she took my right nipple and began to gently bite. It felt like electricity was flowing through me.</p> <p>"Are you okay with this?" I whispered.</p> <p>"I can do this," she whispered back. Her touch made my cock begin to pulse in anticipation of taking her again. She slowly worked her bra straps down off her shoulders and let it slide back down to her waist. It fell away and she hooked her thumbs into the fabric of her panties and moved them down in one fluid motion. Her pussy pressed against my leg as it dropped.</p> <p>"Do you like what you see?" she asked, "or should I ask, what do I see?" She pulled her panties halfway down her thighs and over her shoes. I looked and she was completely shaven. Her pink skin shone against her black hair and she leaned in for a kiss. "Can I feel you inside me," she said.</p> <p>I could not resist and leaned back a little. I felt her lips against my skin and it felt so sensual. I felt her nails dig into my skin as she lightly grazed my entire body. She moved back up my chest, then down. Her nipples felt on my skin and it tickled. I didn't want it to stop and kissed her mouth. We kissed long and hard. Her hand slid down between us and I felt the heat from her pussy.</p> <p>"I want you to do something for me," she said. She reached around my waist, pressing my body against her as she lifted my dress shirt to my neck. Her fingers were like magic, slowly pulling the material of her panties down to her ankles. I felt her bare pussy. Soft light hairs were like feathers against my skin and her scent was so divine. I could not take my eyes off of her. I could no longer keep my eyes off of her for I began to feel a little woozy. Her fingers moved to spread my cheeks. Her touch was soft as it moved from one cheek further down, the back of her hand pressing against my asshole. That did it for me. All the pent-up energy of the past week was released in an explosion, as I felt the orgasm building deep inside me like a storm, like the ocean just a few short steps away.</p> <p>"Oh God," I was moaning and biting on her shoulder as I came. She stopped kissing me and I felt her on her back. Her body was covered in goosebumps as she whispered to me, "let's go to bed."</p> <p>"But...you're naked already," I stammered.</p> <p>"I want you to see what I'm wearing, if you want me to keep it, okay?" It was her turn for the lie. My heart was pounding as she pulled off my dress shoes, socks and pants. She dropped my panties to the floor and then stood, waiting for me. She pulled my bra off, revealing a perfect set of breasts with perfect symmetry and a large pink areola and thick pointed nipples that seemed to be begging attention. I stepped out of my panties and she smiled. I pulled her shirt up over my head, then lifted her arms above her head as she reached for hers. She pulled her arms out of the sleeves and then held them together as she slid my shirt down over my head and tossed it aside. Then she took my hands in hers and drew my back down to the bed.</p> <p>"Let's get this off," she said. I had nothing to do with it at this point as she climbed on me, then laid back and pulled me on top of her. We kissed as her hands started to explore my body.
