She said and took her hand as she walked over to the couch. She sat down beside me and wrapped her arm around my waist. I lay in her lap, hugging both of us. I took her breast into my hand, rubbing myself back and forth over the fabric of my panties. She felt hot and slippery against me and reached up, running her hand along the curve of my thigh. Our lips pressed together and our hands roamed. She undid my bra but left her hand on my breast as it moved up to brush lightly against my nipple. I pressed back into her. She could feel a little wetness on my thigh and gently massaged it up towards my groin. She was arouse as her finger lightly brushed up the length of my nipple. I ran my finger down her breast and circled her areola. Her other hand moved to the other breast and caressed the nipple.</p> <p>I moved my hand on her thigh, teasing the length, up towards her crotch, she took hold of me and led me up so that I was on the floor, still clothed, her legs between mine, she lowered herself down so she was sitting with her knees up and knees wide. I placed myself on her lap. I felt her hot wetness against me as my hands touched her inner thighs as our mouths made love to each other. She moved my hand up her thigh to caress her pussy.</p> <p>"You feel so good," I whispered as I brushed her finger against her slit. I was in heaven as if I had never experienced it before. I was so excited that my finger slid easily into her. She was wet, so eager, but there was no hurry, no fear, no uncertainty. Her pussy wrapped around my finger, not tight, but there, not tight at all, but not resisting either. I felt it slide over my finger as I pulled it back. I looked up into her eyes and she gave me a little wink and a small smile. We took turns sucking and licking her nipples till they ached. Our bodies were shaking now as we continued to kiss her. My juices were running down my thigh as our lips crushed down and her finger was deep into her pussy. I was ready to die now, I wanted to suck and lick her clit, to let her cum on my face. But I couldn't move my finger, I was too sensitive, the way she was moving, I didn't have any chance. I knew that I couldn't.</p> <p>She was moaning softly and she was moving her hips hard against my hand. Then she gasped and held my head tightly to her breast as she rode out her first orgasm. I sucked her nipple hard as her body thrashed at me. "Oh god," she screamed and she pushed my head hard into her. "Let me cum," she whispered again. "Please let me."</p> <p>"No," I said. "No," she cried as she sat up then lay on her back on the couch and opened her legs.</p> <p>"Don't I have to?" I knelt on the floor between her legs. I was looking down as I looked at her pussy and felt my excitement. My hand shook as I brought my fingers to my mouth. There was more wetness than I had imagined. I spread the wetness around her pussy lips and watched as a clear drop of precum oozed out. I leaned forward and sucked it up, making her shudder, not just from the taste. I took my fingers and ran them through her hair and over her breast. The softness of her breast, the smoothness of her flesh, the silky softness, the fullness and the fullness were all so beautiful. I sucked her into my mouth and used my tongue on as many of her erogenous zones as I could but at the same time I felt so aroused that I didn't want her to cum again. I took her clit softly between my teeth and teased it as I lifted up and down her pussy on the way back up. Her hands ran through my hair. Her head jerked back and she closed her eyes but didn't cum.</p> <p>I looked at her face, she was smiling at me with her eyes closed. Her face was bright and flushed, her face was relaxed and beautiful. I lifted her a little off the couch, leaned forward, and kissed her tenderly on the lips. She opened her lips and her tongue danced with mine. Our tongues touched and flicked at each other as we both felt the tension of the moment.</p> <p>I stopped and said, "I think we need some ice water. We are going to need it for what we had today. Do you want to use the ice or just leave your bra?"</p> <p>"What am I supposed to do?" she said. "I was expecting to see you again, and your present."</p> <p>"It's OK, let me take care of itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
