I hear your breathing begin to change in pace as you continue to play. One finger rubs against your clit then two fingers enter you gently. Your fingers are deep inside you now; you know your orgasm is close and you begin to thrust your hips against them. I run my finger into your mouth taking it slowly inside. I slide a glistening finger down your pussy to just tease the outer lips of your pussy as you begin to moan softly. My thumb begins to circle just barely teasing the hard knot there, before pulling away, then quickly circling again. I begin to slide my fingers in and out of you as you lift your hips to meet my hand. My other hand comes to rest on your thigh and begins to roll your inner lip with the pad of my thumb. It feels so sensual sliding into your pussy and rubbing around my hand was just what you needed.</p> <p>Your other hand comes up to replace against your nipple and you begin to pull it down, as you begin to feel and pinch it. Your lips begin to part, as you slide your finger in and out of your wet pussy. You want more and more of me, and you are finding the need to make it possible to have more inside you, and you know I want to be inside you. You pull your breasts from my hand again and bring them to my mouth. I slide my tongue along your nipple and taste the musky flavor. This takes you over the edge, and your moans fill my mind. I feel one of your hands go to my head and hold me still as you try to fuck my mouth with your pussy. Our moans of pleasure seem to echo off the walls. Then you can feel your legs begin to shake as your orgasm flows through you, and you can feel your hips bucking against me...you thrust one last time into my mouth. Your mouth finds my nipple and begins to suck it, and your juices drip down my chin, you have to lean over to take me into your mouth as your orgasm finishes.</p> <p>As your orgasm finally subsides, you slip my cock out of your pussy and bring your hand up to me. You stroke the length of the shaft to the head with the cum that is forming. Once again, you open your mouth to say something but it falls on deaf ears...I'm too far gone to hear it. "Please" I beg, "I want you...I need you...come on me..."</p> <p>And you pull me to you, my hands around your waist. I can feel you shaking as I start to kiss, run my tongue all over your neck and breasts. I feel your nipples begin to stiffen and your breasts begin to push against the palms of my hands. I take your breasts in between my hands, feeling and squeezing them with my thumbs while I kiss your mouth. I move slowly as I feel you begin to quiver under my touch. You begin to kiss my neck and chin...you can feel your wetness starting to drip down as you kiss me. I move down to your stomach, kissing at my way down to my goal...my lips touch the head of your cock. I run my tongue along the slit of your cock...you groan with deep satisfaction. I feel you quiver again, wanting more with you.</p> <p>I place my wet fingertip against your anus and push lightly. One finger slides into you as you push back my finger. I slowly slide it in and out, feeling your anus gripping it. I put one finger in, slowly working it in and out as I pull out on your cock. I can feel the pressure building from your belly as it starts to get tight. I pull out, push in and out faster and harder as you grow more and more ready to have me inside you.</p> <p>A couple of my fingers slide against your prostate and you moan your approval. It's too much for you and you explode, all over my hand. I slide my fingers out of you and your ass slowly relaxes. I slide my fingers clean on my tongue. We taste each other, my cum from my cock in my mouth, my lips. I stand up, pull my fingers from your hole and kiss you. We make our way back towards the bedroom.</p> <p>You are still on your knees as you try to catch your breath. When I walk you back to the bed, we begin slowly kissing. We continue to move together slowly and softly. I can feel how slick and smooth your pussy is as it slides against me in the coolness of the air conditioner and it makes your skin softens. As we kiss and you kiss me I slowly begin to slip out of your pussy, which is still slick from my fingers. You pull me back as you pull me back towards you, our lips barely touching. You move your lips to my neck and begin to kiss it. She whispers in my ear "I loved the way you felt against me inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
