His voice broke, "We have a huge problem."</p> <p>He didn't even look his way as the others looked upon him, except for Miki, who had just walked in, and he turned and looked at her, startled.</p> <p>"Sorry, I was just trying to ease the worry a little."</p> <p>"No, it's ok. I was just hoping you might be in a better mood and go to him. I don't think this will be such a good moment for you."</p> <p>All the rest of the girls came up immediately and hugged him, Miki getting even more emotional, especially when a lot of the new arrivals started to tear up.</p> <p>Once they had dispersed they returned to stand by the door, which he opened gently when he noticed, "You are really good at that! Miki! Please let me know what's important next time, I've got a lot of catching up to do!"</p> <p>His smile was ear to ear. "We'll see," she said, and moved up to hug him.</p> <p>At that moment a group of kids burst in, looking around to see that he was standing with his shirt off and his pants around his ankles. The one kid with him, in a tight t-shirt, who they all knew, was talking to him, but the others made to leave. After several minutes he turned to them, and gave them a warm smile, "I'll be damned!" The one kid who said it was called "Jenny" and the others, all who knew him, got up and followed him.</p> <p>"Hey, look who just walked in!" Jenny exclaimed, "What are you doing here?! Didn't you just get up yet? Come on back!"</p> <p>He got up again and stopped, "Oh, I'm sorry, I'm so tired, I think I'm going to fall asleep here!"</p> <p>Jenny walked him to the floor, "I'm sorry, but I can see that you are in pain. It's going to take a while for you to fall asleep here just so we can talk."</p> <p>"Well, ok," he said, "I know it's really messed up on me, but..."</p> <p>"But what?"</p> <p>"Well, we're just going to have to be able to talk about our problems until he goes off to college. I'm going to need to be good to him, so he has to be good to me, no questions."</p> <p>Her face fell, "Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I know that's a little scary, but I'm pretty sure. I just don't want to hurt you. I don't want you to get hurt right now," he stated with a slight quiver in his voice. She gave him an understanding look, "I understand. I can handle it. I just really need to get my mind on other things. I'll get you something to drink...ok?"</p> <p>"That'd be great. I'll get up, then. If you have something on, would you like me to get you a drink, some tea or something."</p> <p>"Just the tea, no pills. I'm fine thanks." As he headed up stairs she continued to hold on, trying to think of something to give him an excuse to fall asleep. There was a lump in his throat. He finally managed to get up and get up while the others stood on each side of him, "Hey! Hey! I'm sorry, I just was just going to get you something, I'll get you some water, and you can have some aspirin, or something, that might help you sleep, but thank you! I'll get you some aspirin, OK?" Before he could say anything they were gone, and he stood there for several minutes. He finally managed to calm down just enough to realize he had no idea when the sleep attack was. It was probably going to be late and he could never remember the attack, and it had been so long since he was home. He quickly went through his pockets and grabbed something to drink, and a towel as his mind drifted off to sleep.</p> <p></p> <p>Later in the evening the group of girls appeared at the door, carrying bowls of water and some aspirin. He was still asleep when they all joined him and walked around him, sitting next to each other and hugging.</p> <p>"Hey, what's up?" Jenny offered.</p> <p>"Well, I was wondering if you would like to go on a walk around campus again?"</p> <p>"Do you think I'm ready for that kind of walking in the woods?" she commented.</p> <p>He nodded, "Yeah, I think we shouldn't go there. There's too many people around, and I don't think people would like itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
