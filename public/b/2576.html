She just wanted to do it to you instead."</p> <p>"I guess she did, but the feeling of you in me with that finger in me, it was wonderful."</p> <p>"Mmm, I've wanted you this long."</p> <p>She slid her finger in and out a few times and then turned it over to him and stuck it up and down his shaft and it felt like it was growing. "We're going to make love."</p> <p>She lifted herself and they hugged and kissed and she was on her back and he was on top of her and all of a sudden she pulled him down and they were kissing and they were making out for what felt like hours, it was great and it was just as good as ever. She pulled him down and they climbed on the bed and kissed again and once again he was between her legs and she was on top of him again and then it just felt like anything in the world right then. He wasn't just taking her, he was taking up for his new friend. He felt he'd done the right thing in making love twice on a cruise ship and once again they were going for some kind of a magical fuck.</p> <p>"Take me, Baby," she whispered. "Please, please take me."</p> <p>He didn't hesitate and he slowly put all his weight on her and when he got into her, she was wet and ready for him. With long, slow strokes he buried himself fully into her and they both moaned and he leaned down and sucked on her breasts and she felt like he'd go soft in her.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," he said. "Yes."</p> <p>She was pulling him on to her, he pulled her on to him and the next time he was in her, he was there again and it was like she was pulling him on to her again and that really made it even more wonderful. She knew it was going to end and to think about what a great idea it would be to make love to someone else.</p> <p>"You are marvelous, you make me so happy," she said when she had had enough.</p> <p>"I know, sweetheart, just like that, fuck me and let go," he told her and he rolled her on to her back and they kissed again then he put all of his weight on her just like before and it felt like he was filling her. He kept in that position several times and he was sure he would cum but he didn't and he still felt so good in her.</p> <p>"Do you ever think about someone else doing you?" she said softly.</p> <p>"It's a bit embarrassing but yes, a few times, at first, but at first it was for some reason, but it didn't seem to be a big deal. I think it was just something I had a thing for but I think it grew on me. I always knew I would like making love to someone because it was what I wanted. I never thought about it or anything like that other than to love my man. Now I think that's what I want to feel too."</p> <p>"You're the most beautiful woman I've ever known, I'll do anything for you," he told her. "I want to spend every moment of every day of my life with you and I'd love to ask you to marry me."</p> <p>"Would you?" she asked. "If it would make you happy, what's in mind?"</p> <p>"I don't know, maybe. Just think about us taking a trip to the islands and I'll talk about it, but just think about us moving in together. It seems like the world would be different than it used to be."</p> <p>"Yes, but we always thought we'd be different, you're the most romantic, I'm the most romantic. I'd love to do it all with you."</p> <p>"My love for you is unlimited," he told her. "This is great and I've always wanted to, but I don't now, nor will I. I'm just so happy that I don't want to change my life or anything."</p> <p>"Well, I'm glad you're happy. When I say happy, I mean I'm all yours. Maybe I'll just ask if I can ask you to marry me?"</p> <p>"Really? How do you know that, sweetheart?"</p> <p>"I've looked it up before in the book and this thing I know about weddings and of course, I read it. I read it from the bookkeeper to her."</p> <p>"Mmmmmm, I think we are getting somewhere. How about we go toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
