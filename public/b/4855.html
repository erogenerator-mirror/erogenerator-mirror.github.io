I can't do it there. But I do have to go to the club. It's a one-to-one situation, if you know what I mean. I won't meet anyone I don't know until Friday night. I have to make a decision tomorrow night.</p> <p>You're going to the club, right?”</p> <p>“Yep. I have to pick out my date,”</p> <p>I really like that, don't I? It makes me feel a bit special. I'm in love, and I'd like to feel that special feeling for you when we make love,”</p> <p>I felt the same strong feeling as he started to move his hand up and down my thigh. I could feel the warmth of his lips on mine. He was so excited!</p> <p>When we got to the club, we started to dance. We danced close. His hand was rubbing my crotch through my pants, it was so good. I could smell the perfume on him that I love. I could actually smell his cock.</p> <p>I put my hand on his erection. He didn't move back. I started to put my tongue in his ear. His ear was so warm. He turned his head and we were kissing again. Our tongues intertwined.</p> <p>My cock was hard so fast. I don't know how good it was. He felt it and I felt it.</p> <p>I stood up, my hands going to his waist. I pulled you close to me, our lips met again. I could feel the fire of passion that I started to feel in him.</p> <p>And then I wanted his cock.</p> <p>My hand wrapped around your cock as we danced.</p> <p>Your hand felt so good, touching my hard cock. I thought the music would be more romantic. I thought I could have you in me at the end of the song. Right in the middle of the song!</p> <p>Let me go back to the dance floor,”</p> <p>I pulled off your belt. I sat back down and you sat beside me. I sat you on the other side of the dance floor, where we could rub our cocks against each other just a little bit,”</p> <p>Your hand went to the top of your pants. I kept touching your cock.</p> <p>I pulled off your shirt. It was so soft. My hand went to your chest, I started to rub your chest. I felt your nipple which felt so hard. I rubbed it to hardness. My fingers would rub the other nipple. My cock got hard. I would love you more.</p> <p>It felt so good feeling the smoothness of your body against mine. You pulled me toward you with the rhythm of the music, as you pressed your groin against mine, your cock was still up against my leg. I was in heaven I thought as I had this beautiful woman, and she is dancing with me.</p> <p>It was so good feeling you against me as our tongues started to explore each others mouths. As I pulled you closer, I felt your stiff cock against my thigh as it was pressed against mine.</p> <p>My hands started to unbutton your jeans.</p> <p>I pulled off you shirt.</p> <p>We were naked in the middle of a packed club, people talking, making out in the middle of the room, it was so erotic. I felt your cock. I could see your cock, throbbing, as you had to take it out of your pants again.</p> <p>I slid to the floor and I started to caress all of you, from your beautiful cock to your balls. It would be so good, I thought. I couldn't stop. I felt you on me, your whole body was tingling, I wanted you more. I wanted you deep inside of me. I want to feel you inside of me.</p> <p>I felt you slide over me, as I felt your face press against me.</p> <p>“That feels great,”, I replied. “You really are a man”</p> <p>I pushed you off of me. I was so excited. I wanted you more.</p> <p>It took your hand first, to reach down to take hold of my cock in your hand, your other hand reached between us to put it in my trousers. It felt so big, it was hard enough.</p> <p>Your fingers wrapped around mine. Your big, soft hands were making me tingle. You lifted me up again, as you rubbed my cock against you. I couldn't stop moaning. I couldn't stop looking at what you were doing with my cock.</p> <p>You couldn't get enough. You wanted me. I could feel your cock pressed against my pelvis, and as you rubbed me with your hand, I wanted to feel myself all over. I leaned up to suck your ear lobe with my tongue as your hand played with mine.</p> <p>You pulled me closer.
