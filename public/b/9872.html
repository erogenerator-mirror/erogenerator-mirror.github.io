Now let me get you something. I haven't got anything for you, but I can get you some good stuff too. I have a little present for you."</p> <p>"I don't think you can just have all that," he said with a smirk on his face.</p> <p>"It isn't as bad as I thought it would be."</p> <p>"What's in it?" he asked as he opened the box that contained the little book. The look he got from her when she opened it nearly put an end to his little stunt. But in the moment of passion he had brought up something that had been written on it so they could look at it later. And now the little thing was just a tiny little thing from Victoria's hand, hidden somewhere beneath her nightie. What the hell was a little thing under his nightie?</p> <p>"I don't know. I just need a little something to help me sleep," he said, and she turned around to face him again.</p> <p>"It wasn't that you needed help with it. It was just that your little gift of love seems to have helped it in some way." Victoria said, her eyes on him and her hand reaching out towards him towards the nightie.</p> <p>"What am I doing?" he asked, half excited now. What the hell was the last thing that had changed between them in the span of thirty minutes? And what did it really look like?</p> <p>"I think that I would like to know the answers to that a little better," she answered as she reached out and lightly touched him on his leg. He jumped at the contact, it was so erotic. He looked at her, his eyes half closed. Her hand was lightly sliding along his leg, up over his thigh toward his crotch again. He leaned his head against her, he wanted so much to have that contact again.</p> <p>"I didn't mean for the gift to be something that doesn't take much time. It's just that I think it might have changed things between us." He said, trying to look serious now. "Please don't be mad at me. It doesn't mean anything. It is just something that I feel I should have. I just love you too much to not love you. I don't want you feeling anything or to feel anything but your love."</p> <p>"I never feel bad about being silly. You are the only one that I love." She said as she lifted his head back up to look into her eyes again. "I really do love you. And I love the fact that we have each other in each other's arms and love each other all of the time. Like I said before, I have no problems doing all of these things with others, and I don't mind having people love me because I love them too. Don't you?"</p> <p>"I guess not." He said as all of a sudden he felt quite uncomfortable. It was getting closer to the time he thought he had spent with Victoria and the other women in the hospital when he felt that he knew how to do it.</p> <p>"I will be with you in a minute. Don't worry." She said as she kissed him again on the lips and stood up.</p> <p>"I love you. Now go put your nightie on. I'll be back in a second."</p> <p>She led him into the bathroom of the suite after leaving the room and locked the door. He looked up at her as she walked by him. She had taken off her bathrobe. She was naked but only wearing some panties. He was mesmerized by the image of her and the other women in the room. She turned around and faced him. Her arms were crossed over her breasts leaving her head and chest slightly upwards.</p> <p>"Are you still hungry? I just ate a little, so it won't be as bad." She said as she reached out and touched his arm.</p> <p>"Yes, I'm hungry. I didn't want you to get hungry and have to stay in."</p> <p>"No you stay. There is no rush to get out of bed. And you may not ever want me to stop kissing you." She said softly before giving him a quick kiss on the lips. He couldn't bring himself to look at her like that. But if they were coming back to bed, they had to. She took the covers off of the bed, leaving the one that had seen Victoria's breast to fall over the head of the bed. Her breasts fell off to the side and were just at a level with his face. Her whole body was exposed to him. He just stared at the sight that had been before him, and the sight that he was sure was again coming back to him now.</p> <p>"I am very hungry, it's just that you don't have muchâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
