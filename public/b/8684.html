He promised that she liked it and that she'd give him a good show. She did. Now was her chance to take his virginity. He was going to have big, hard dicks, but now he was her first time of his life, and she'd be his first fuck. He was her first time of his life, too. All those thoughts, as she looked at the huge bulge in his jeans, and wondered how her father would take it if he ever found out his little sister was being fucked by another man.</p> <p>She thought about him. She was hot for him, and knew that there's nothing better than meeting hard-on salesman on the Internet. She thought about the sex. It was so good, so exciting. She'd like to give him that, too (not that it was bad). She was sure about him. He'd never go for it. He'd never go for any of it. He wouldn't. But the idea intrigued her. It seemed like an interesting and risky and nasty way to go. But it turned out to be good enough. It started with some girl having sex with her college boyfriend, and then she met a nice guy at work. Now that she knew more about him, she could imagine things like that happening. And he didn't turn out like everyone else. Not even the boss would know about it. She'd never told anyone.</p> <p>But what happened next shocked her. Now that it happened, it was right in front of her face. It was not the first time she'd had sex with a stranger, but it was the first time that a girl would go along with it. And it was only the second time in her life and the first of any of them with her. They were going to fuck with each other when they came to a stop at a light and looked back to see if her sister was on the road. The guy had been at a light, he hadn't been moving. It was very dark. She knew that nobody was paying any attention to them in the dark. She'd never actually thought of other students in this way, but she was suddenly getting turned on by the fact. She opened her mouth to take a big breath, but then thought of the time when she'd been at home alone at night.</p> <p>It was about ten years ago. It was still dark, though. At that time there should have been people. But no one was watching them now. As the lights went on, they stopped suddenly to look at her. A light in the street turned on and the lights were getting brighter. He was staring at her, he couldn't take his eyes off her. She smiled back at him.</p> <p>He was about to say something, but his eyes opened up and he blinked hard in the dim light.</p> <p>"Wow," he said, "you really are gorgeous. Is that nice?" he said, with a broad smile.</p> <p>"That sounds great." She was blushing at that admission. Not that she wanted to be blushing. Not very much, actually. She felt a bit selfconscious being in front of him, but her thoughts were a bit too much to be embarrassed.</p> <p>"I'm not sure I can do this, Mom." He still wasn't looking at her.</p> <p>"Sure you can." She took a big breath, "I mean, it feels amazing." she whispered.</p> <p>"It does, doesn't it, Mom?" She looked him over while trying to look at him and saw that he was looking back too.</p> <p>"It's a thrill. I can't believe I'm doing this," she said, "It's kind of crazy, isn't it."</p> <p>He looked down. He wasn't trying to look, at least not at his dick, "Yes, you are. You just had a great time, aren't you," he said in a kind and friendly tone.</p> <p>She turned away, "We did. Yes, we did. It's just that... well, now that I'm older, it's still weird looking at other people's bodies like that." She tried to look past her blushing and saw his eyes on her legs.</p> <p>"It's not a big deal," he said after a moment. He looked at the ground. Then he looked at her, "And it is a really strange sensation... the way that the skin is so soft and smooth and the way it's so soft and smooth and so wet, there's actually a feeling of electricity in it."</p> <p>She wanted to believe him, but she couldn't. She didn't think it was such a big deal.</p> <p>They both stood there a moment in silence until she turned to look him in theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
