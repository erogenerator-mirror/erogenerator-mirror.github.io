It was also a couple of days before the day's work would be done. We hadn't been to a party since the last time I worked there. I was still thinking about the day's fun. That wasn't a good start to the night. I knew you guys were going to have fun tonight too.</p> <p>-</p> <p>I was about halfway done with my drink, sipped it and watched as Trish and some of your crew chatted up other girls. The alcohol loosened my tongue somewhat. I'm soooo in a wine daze right now. You two are one sexy couple, right? Or is that what you want too? I can't say what I want, but I think maybe I want you both. We could be fun tonight though. Maybe just one.</p> <p>-</p> <p>Maybe I can be something of a slut in the club tonight, too. But I have to be in control of where we go from here. I guess it's best that she gets drunk, too. Maybe that'll work out somehow.</p> <p>-</p> <p>I finished my drink and set my purse down as I finished mine. She is looking down at my crotch so innocently when she first came in. She looks so fucking sexy, I think it's time I put a cuckold in her. I could never tell someone who knows about a couple of gay guys she was banging. Maybe it would be alright. I mean, I just fucked her for the week, so I really got tired of it and it'll be fun when we get married.</p> <p>-</p> <p>The rest of the day's work was finished. We met a few more guys for the evening and I got a lot of work I should have completed earlier too. As I mentioned before, the club was hopping and there was a lot of good, live action. I just wanted to get it over with, but all of the girls were hot for me. I didn't see any reason to get a new cock up my ass.</p> <p>-</p> <p>Before I really know it we're back inside the club, Trish is pulling down a tight little skirt and a blouse that I'll never get on again. She's a vision of sexy beauty, her long, black hair falling down to the tops of her gorgeous breasts. I couldn't tell if she was wearing a bra, but she looked like they didn't work. The way her tits popped out and jiggling, I thought you could see the bra through a blouse.</p> <p>-</p> <p>Trish's back against me as I push her skirt up and my tongue down her throat. She feels so soft at the same time. She moans a little when my hand goes to her crotch and I start rubbing her, my cock already fully hard. I take my hand off of her crotch, knowing it'll get her hot again if her pussy is going to get my cock.</p> <p>-</p> <p>I start stroking her clit real slow and with my thumb, pressing the hood. It's really easy to get a real good grip like this as the blood rushes into the head of it. It actually throbs and throbs. Trish's breathing and moaning gets louder. I start to kiss her neck and kiss her neck harder. Now that it's been a few weeks, I do actually want a chance to give her a hickey. I don't want my cock to leave her mouth yet, so I just give it a slight pull and pull my lips away.</p> <p>-</p> <p>"Trish! I'm gonna kiss your neck like this for a while, but I want to see if you really want a cock. My cock needs to see your lips wrapped around it."</p> <p>Trish does just as I suggested, but she lets out a gasp of excitement that makes her all hot and sexy all over again.</p> <p>"It's my turn now," my lips whisper as my hands pull her skirt down her thighs. I kiss her again on the lips, this time pushing my tongue into her mouth. All of it tastes so good and I can tell I'm driving her crazy. Her hands try to push my head away, my lips brush them, so she pushes me away slightly.</p> <p>"Wait. Wait a bit." I say between kisses. "You'll see that I really love everything about this night. It's such a sexy feeling, that you won't ever be able to get enough of it. This is my first cock. I promise I'll make you so hard and so hot and then I'll make you lick it all off. Trust me, this first one, isn't going to feel that good, but I'll take every inch of it in.</p> <p>-</p> <p>You can't believe what happened last time. Trish seemed to be doing all the right things with her tongueâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
