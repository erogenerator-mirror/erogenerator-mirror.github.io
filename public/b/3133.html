She looked around a second time and wrote something down then returned her hand to her lap.</p> <p>"You're kidding ... you know, you never really looked at yourself like that?"</p> <p>"Maybe not. We have done that a hundred times - it's like trying to get in the first jockey, isn't it? Well, it never worked. This is a bit surreal, and now I want to have sex with you. But, that doesn't necessarily mean I want to make love with you."</p> <p>"Oh, right." He said looking at me with a small smile and a quick glance. It was a nervous look really. "If you're comfortable with that, we can take things slowly."</p> <p>I took a half-step towards her, and gently removed her hands from her lap. I felt compelled to hold her while it was easier.</p> <p>"If you're uncomfortable, I want you to sit on the edge of the bed, okay?" I said as I leaned forward and pressed my body to hers. I took her shoulders gently as she settled down on the bed.</p> <p>I kissed her briefly before leaning forward again and putting two and two together.</p> <p>"I've always wanted to kiss you." I said.</p> <p>"Me too." She replied.</p> <p>"It's only fair," I continued, "that you find out what a really good kiss is. I mean I've kissed a few of these girls, but none had this one girl really kiss me back."</p> <p>"I don't doubt for one second you did that any of them, and it was great ... even if I did let go of my feelings, I can't say I was disappointed."</p> <p></p> <p>"I wish I'd done this long ago." I replied.</p> <p>"I'm so glad you did. I've wanted this for ages. I just wish we were just a couple. I don't want anyone to think I'm just a single girl, but I'm not that way either. I feel different."</p> <p>I could tell that she felt different too as well.</p> <p>I leaned in and put my lips to hers, slowly parting her lips.</p> <p>"You taste so good."</p> <p>"Just for me?" she smiled at me.</p> <p>"And just as sweet."</p> <p>She put her arms around me and squeezed them tightly around my neck for a moment.</p> <p>"Well, you're right. We are definitely different."</p> <p>We parted just as quickly. My hand reached out for hers again and she accepted it as I took hers away. We sat there for a second, holding hands all the while, with our hands touching each other.</p> <p>Eventually, I asked, "Do you want to do this again sometime?"</p> <p>"If we're ever free, I'd love to." She said with a mischievous smile.</p> <p>I could barely look at her as I spoke.</p> <p>"I'd think it might be fun if you were naked in front of me sometimes," I said.</p> <p>"Why don't we shower together? It's much more private than showering alone." she suggested.</p> <p>The shower had a hot, wet feel, so we quickly went into our soapy embraces.</p> <p>We had not yet been intimate, but I had my hand on her back holding her tight against me while our lips pressed together gently and lovingly.</p> <p>Just as we were getting out, our bodies were pressed together for what seemed like the third or fourth time that day. Our lips were pressed together now and I heard her deep moan as I ran my tongue between her lips one last time.</p> <p>We both had to get up soon, and I took my hand from her back and led her out to the shower.</p> <p>As she opened the shower door, a large grin formed on her face.</p> <p>I turned the water off and then grabbed her in my big arms and kissed her tenderly again. The water cascaded down between our bodies as we embraced in it.</p> <p>We parted lips suddenly and I quickly dropped my hands down from her neck. She pushed me away and stepped out of the shower quickly.</p> <p>"I can't believe I just did that," she exclaimed, "I wasn't expecting that. But maybe we can take this a little slower."</p> <p>She quickly grabbed the top of the shower curtain and pulled it back from the wall. The spray from the shower was starting to cool our way down.</p> <p>"The next time we're in bed, it might be a little more comfortable." I said with a mischievous smile.</p> <p>"Just wait," she added.</p> <p>It was almost like we had a pact for a quick kiss. Then she turned around and picked up her clothing. We both put our arms around each otherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
