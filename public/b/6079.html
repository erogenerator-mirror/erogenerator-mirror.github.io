John said as he leaned in to give her a kiss. It felt like he was peeling away her bra cup for a second as he pulled gently on the straps and finally she lifted her arms to let him pull her bra off. She was lying back propped up on her pillows and he quickly went back to his own position, his face next to hers.</p> <p>"I've been waiting for this all day for the chance to be with you," he whispered in her ear. "Do you remember the first time you kissed me back like that?"</p> <p>"Well you were so sexy and you were so nice." She said and felt him nuzzle and kiss her neck. She shivered with passion for him but instead of grabbing some cover she started pulling his mouth down to her waiting breast. He was a natural as the feel of his tongue swiped across her nipple elicited a gasp from her lips and neck. John sucked and teased her nipple as her desire grew hotter.</p> <p>"Oh daddy," she moaned as she felt the warmth of his tongue lap at her breast, it was so beautiful. "God I've missed you." She groaned as she felt him tugging on the skirt of her panties and then pulling gently at the waist. She knew they were on the floor so she lifted her knees to allow him to remove them. "Ohhhh, daddy." She moaned as he pulled them along side her panties. He pulled them from her slowly as she pushed her ass back to meet him, then he lifted her feet to remove those as well. His kisses continued over her body as he continued pulling her panties down her legs. "Oh god daddy." She said and she lifted her arms so he could pull her panties off all the way. He dropped them to the floor and then started kissing her again as she reached to pull him against the mattress.</p> <p>"Get on up here." Her hands moved up and slowly he undid the buttons on his shirt as he crawled up to lay against her. She opened her eyes to see him in his pants but he was looking down at her instead of at her. In a single movement he pulled off his shirt and laid down along the way. In an instant he was on top of her, her arms came up to pull him right up against her again. He pushed his fingers into her pussy and teased the insides as she tried to pull herself against him. "Oh baby. You're so lovely." He said and she moved her legs up along his sides again.</p> <p>"Daddy, please fuck me." She begged. "Fuck me now."</p> <p>He rolled so they were both on their sides and he moved into her without a word. "Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Oh yeah. God yess." She said as she wrapped her legs around him. "That's what's happening."</p> <p>"If you're sure then we can keep here for the rest of the night." He said as his penis was pushed deeply inside of her.</p> <p>"Yess. I want you to fuck me so hard." She moaned as his hips rocked back and forth, driving himself fully into her.</p> <p>"Ohhh yes baby." He replied just as she felt herself explode as she was lifted to press her ass back against his erection. "Ohhh."</p> <p>John was moving slowly now as he started to cum himself, just as much in the throws of an orgasm as he was feeling her excitement at the feeling. They stayed still for so long until he was completely satisfied from both sex and exhaustion. They lay there a short while before she began to move her hand again. She was already getting close and he didn't mind.</p> <p>"I need you to fuck me some more. Please." She said as she reached for her shirt.</p> <p>"Not a chance. You want to cum on me." He said and grabbed at her waist while she pushed herself up against him.</p> <p>"That will never get done." She said. "I'm not done."</p> <p>She reached between them and took his cock in her hand. They both had been hard before but now it was becoming even harder. Their eyes locked as she brought it to her mouth and started to suck it from him.</p> <p>"Oh god." He groaned. "Do it. Taste me." He leaned down to kiss her and she pulled him back to her as they kissed once more. He felt her lips open slightly and he felt her tongue slide across his and he held onto her shoulder. It was a feeling that left him wanting to take her right there. John's kiss was soft yet fierce and it made her whole body tremble with desire. Her legs were wrapped around him and she held on for dear life as John pounded her cunt with his hardness. He felt her start to shake with the force of him as she gaspedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
