You’ve been so hard on yourself since last Christmas”. He took his jacket off again and threw it on the back of the couch.</p> <p>She followed him back into the bedroom and he took off his robe before climbing back on top of her. They kissed for what seemed like forever but was probably only a couple minutes before she opened her mouth to give him his first taste of her mouth. She pushed her tongue into his mouth and found his tongue’s first taste of hers, which she used to stimulate him until he came. She then wrapped her legs around his hips and rubbed her fingers over his cock trying to get more of it into her.</p> <p>“Fuck me with that cock baby”.</p> <p>He slid down and her soaked pussy made a wet squelching noise as she grabbed his hair in a fist pulling him back towards her. He was now kneeling on the bed on the other side of her and she lifted her legs into the air, pulling his cock as he entered her. He started slowly, watching her mouth form into a circle and his tongue begin to run circles between her bottom lip and tongue. He continued in this fashion for a minute, slowly gaining confidence as he picked up the pace. He was now pounding her pussy really hard and she began to match his thrusts with her own. As he felt his balls start to tighten he took his hands off of both breasts and put them up on top of hers. He began to increase the speed and force of his fucking and watched her beautiful face on the side of the bed at the same time. She was staring into his eyes and moaning in between his kisses. She was so wet, she was squealing and making a lot of noise.</p> <p>“Please fuck me baby!!!”</p> <p>“I’m sorry”.</p> <p>“Please fuck me”.</p> <p>As he began fucking her harder and deeper with his cock he couldn’t hold onto his self control much longer. He had been fighting this for awhile now. He began to speed up and she was moving her hips with each thrust. As he was about to let go he looked down and saw that her tongue was running down his cock and she was getting her mouth full of his cock at a time she could get his balls at the same time.</p> <p>He knew that he couldn’t hold any more and said “I'm gonna cum now!”</p> <p>“Yeah, cum in me! I need your cum!”.</p> <p>He didn’t care and she could feel his cum shooting deep inside of her and he held her close as he continued to pound away into her. A few strokes later he told “here we go again” and they were both covered with their juices, which were leaking from around his cock and down her legs. He collapsed on the bed next to her.</p> <p>“Are you ok”?</p> <p>“Yeah”?</p> <p>“That was fucking awesome. I really needed that you know.”</p> <p>“Yeah, it was worth it”.</p> <p>She just laid there in ecstasy—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
