I just want our sex to be special, please, please give me a chance to change my mind."</p> <p>"I would think you were crazy if you wanted us to fuck!" she declared defiantly, giving me a wink of her eye.</p> <p>I couldn't believe it. Her behavior was a tad too dramatic for this crowd.</p> <p>We had just finished one of her stories when the bartender poured the drink. I sat down to finish my drink, not knowing what to do. She then sat down next to me. As I sat down, I was struck by a thought.</p> <p>"I hope you are ready for this to be the last sex of your life. We need to establish some boundaries. If this is going to hurt your feelings, then I don't want to make you do it. If you want to try to have sex with someone else, then just let it go. Whatever you can do, you can do. I would suggest you put up with it for at least a month, unless you need to get out of here. If you feel the need or desire to take you somewhere else, I understand."</p> <p>We made our way up front with the drinks and settled our tab. Her hand, like mine, was a bit unsteady on my arm. She was also making her rounds. She was flirting with me throughout our walk and she would stop once in a while to chat with me. I figured I'd get around to it, even though it was hard to tell for sure. For the first night in a row, we would not even kiss so that was a big step. After awhile, we felt a bit tipsy and a couple glasses more into the evening, just to prove I could fuck.</p> <p>When I said, "Okay, I feel a bit tipsy, let's do this." we were headed into the back of the bar because she knew from a mile away that I had been drinking while she was at the bar. When we got to the end, it was at the corner of the bar.</p> <p>She said casually, "Are you okay, I asked if you felt a little flirty? You are a good kisser." She gave me a wink as my eyes widened.</p> <p>I said sarcastically, "No, you guys are just so fucking sexy!"</p> <p>She smiled a beautiful smile and said firmly, "You are a fucking hottie."</p> <p>And in that I had become the personification of her sexuality.</p> <p>"Hmmm," I thought. She gave me a sly look. She then leaned over and whispered, "Have fun."</p> <p>And she got up from the bar.</p> <p>I heard the bartender asking where we could get some drinks.</p> <p>"Uh," I said, "We can buy our drinks at this bar and we can do this."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" he asked. Then he asked us to put our drinks in the cooler and he went right back to the bar. We did as we were told. When the bartender brought three beers apiece for each of us, we all tipped him in the negative.</p> <p>"Oh, thank you!" I said.</p> <p>"What did you think we were going to do?"</p> <p>"I don't know. We were going to, but it looks like it will get dark soon."</p> <p>"This was supposed to be a fun evening!" I said as I handed him my credit card.</p> <p>"So?" He asked sarcastically.</p> <p>"It was supposed to have been fun, not something so...intense." I said.</p> <p>We continued to sip our beers, but as we did, I noticed that most of the other patrons knew what we were doing. Some men looked a bit apprehensive, but most of the women were openly staring at the couple that shared the bar. Not one of them ever said anything, however.</p> <p>"What happens in here stays here", I said.</p> <p>The bar was dimly lit, with a couple of tables each side of it. The bartender came over and opened the front door. As he opened the door we all headed inside. We decided to go on back. I took my time and headed towards the ladies' room.</p> <p>I went up in the dimly lighted bathroom and looked around. It was kind of dark, but no one was looking our way. I noticed people were walking our way as they passed by. I could see my wife's legs as she walked. There was not much to do but look out theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
