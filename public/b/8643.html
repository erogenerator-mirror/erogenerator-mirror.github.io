"I'll come with you when I take you home."</p> <p>"Oh. We'll have to be prepared for everything."</p> <p>"I'm glad you liked the show."</p> <p>"And I love all your other things. Like your jewelry, the car..."</p> <p>"I like things, too," she said, smiling. Both of them got up and went into the living room. He sat her on the couch and got her a wine; she snuggled on top of him, her head resting on his chest, and he rubbed his hands across her shoulders, and back, then down along her spine and into the top of her stockings.</p> <p>"Honey, I love you and I want us to be together forever, but I don't want to go to hell for loving you. Don't you realize that I didn't love you for what the other night was?"</p> <p>"I don't..." she started but he put a finger to her lips again.</p> <p>"You don't love me as deeply as I love you. When I love you, I know it, but you know it, too."</p> <p>"That's not true," she said and closed her eyes, hoping that she didn't have her heart broken and her heart torn.</p> <p>"I know you can't stay here forever, honey. There's a lot that needs to go before we can get back together."</p> <p>"What's this about?"</p> <p>"It's a personal matter. It's all personal. You don't have to say anything. I do want you back, baby. It's just the two of us."</p> <p>He kissed her again, long strokes of his tongue against hers, and her body relaxed, her heart warming at its touch. When she opened her eyes again, he moved his mouth away from hers.</p> <p>"Do you love me?" she whispered, trying to think of something else. He smiled and nodded.</p> <p>"Do you love me enough to do this?"</p> <p>She smiled. "I think you might be right," she replied, and then closed her eyes again.</p> <p>"I know," he said softly, and then closed her eyes again. "I'm afraid that if I look at your face, I'll lose it. Not love. But I'll be able to tell you that I love you. That you make my life worth living."</p> <p>She smiled, loving how he knew those things. "That's true. You're a good man. And you've always been that way."</p> <p>"That was a good idea. To know that I love you and that I'm not afraid anymore," he said, as he put his arms around her, pulling her body to his chest, his mouth moving to hers again. She melted under his lips, feeling his heat and passion and feeling her heartbeat accelerate as he kissed her.</p> <p>He pulled away, taking his time. "Come with me," he whispered. She stood and got up from the couch, leading the way to his bedroom. They fell onto the bed, their mouths meeting once again as he pulled her into him. He held onto her for a couple of minutes, his body pressing against hers as their tongues fought each other, their hearts beating faster and faster. His erection had started to grow and harden in his breeches as they kissed.</p> <p>She felt the heat of his hardness as he pulled them down, her legs parting automatically, welcoming him, eager for the heat to heat up again. He lifted her off of the bed and lay her on the bed, laying beside her, his mouth against her neck, his hands cupping her breasts as hers were on his erection. She opened her legs wide to him, his fingers spreading the lips of her, pulling her clit hood back.</p> <p>He moved on top of her, taking of his breeches, and then his shirt. Her hand found its way to his shoulders, down his arms, and his chest, finding him hard and erect, and she guided his cock into her, and then guided him in her. She felt his thickness as it slid into her. She closed her eyes and felt him go in deeper, the heat and sensation of him inside hers. His eyes closed, his face turned up, his head back as he leaned down to kiss her, the feeling of his tongue and his erection moving together as they kissed.</p> <p>"I love you," she said and whispered over and over into their kiss.</p> <p>"I love you," he said, and they broke the kiss, kissing again as he moved her onto her back.</p> <p>"You sure?"</p> <p>"Yes," he answered, as he moved to the bed, and he held her. "We can be together forever and never lose that thing."</p> <p>"Oh."</p> <p>"What do you want me to doâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
