I had always felt like it was a fantasy – a sexual fantasy – for her.</p> <p>My pussy was on fire. It was wet and warm and pulsed. Every nerve seemed to be firing off at once. I could hear my juices smeared on the front of her panties. Then I thought, “if she’s not wearing underwear, I’m sure she’ll be wearing them to the airport.” Her panties were soaking with cum. The smell was strong and I couldn’t resist. “No, I’m too far removed now” I thought to myself, “but not as far as with my hands.”</p> <p>“You’ll ruin me”, I thought to myself.</p> <p>My hands were trembling as I lifted her skirt and I saw no panties. They were still wet from her orgasm. Her thighs wrapped themselves around me and my hands were still moving up and down the length of her body. I was still holding my hands on the outsides of her bra cups. Her fingers were running through my hair, touching me and then retreating. I wanted more – much more. What had I done?</p> <p>“It’s my turn to tease you.” I whispered.</p> <p>She looked up at me as her skirt was lifted from the floor and I felt like a sex maniac. The bulge in my panties was huge and I felt wet. The smell of fresh cum was thick and strong against my nose. I felt like the most desirable woman and she looked up at me and smiled as she stroked my hair, her hands running through my hair. I wanted to kiss her. I wanted to run my tongue down her throat and taste her hot cum. I was still looking her in the eye as I ran my fingers between her lips and then toying with my clit. I had never felt more turned on.</p> <p>I kissed her and then she pulled my sweater completely off. She touched my face and her voice was sexy as she spoke in French.</p> <p>“It’s your turn now. I want you naked.”</p> <p>Her words were like poetry. I had never had a woman say that before. I felt like a woman possessed.</p> <p>“No-o,” I whispered. I didn’t know what the hell I was doing. It was too soon. I looked around the room. There were still people in the conference area. I couldn’t decide if there would be anyone else there, but it is always crowded with men watching people with their hands over their mouths. The smell of sperm was more concentrated and the sounds of fucking and sucking were clearer and louder.</p> <p>I thought that I might be too far gone too quickly. She was the one pushing me and she wanted me. I wanted her – my wife, my lover.</p> <p>I removed my skirt again and my panties again. I was in a daze of lust. I was feeling the warm wetness between her thighs and my panties were already soaked. My hands ran over her thigh as she slid her hand up onto mine. I felt wetness on my thumb as her fingertips stroked me. Her thumb traced the line of my pussy lips. I was panting as I stared at her. I closed my eyes. Her palm had me so turned on and so wet. It was like she didn’t even know what she was touching. I felt it was only foreplay and no more. I pulled my hand away from hers and looked at her. She smiled mischievously at me as her fingers ran along my inner thigh.</p> <p>“You like what you see”, I thought.</p> <p>I didn’t know what she was talking about but I looked into her eyes again and I could see an excitement on them as they sparkled a little as she smiled at me and stroked me. I wanted more. I wanted to have her right there like the first time. I wanted to feel her and have her taste me again as I did the first time. All I wanted was to have sex with her again. She sat on her office chair and spread her legs wide for me. My legs came together underneath her and she slowly stroked her fingers up my pussy again.</p> <p>“Touch me,” she said and suddenly I felt her hot hand on my stomach, across my breasts, under my skirt and then my stomach. She touched and stroked my stomach as my hips began to thrust.</p> <p>“You know how to touch you like that”, she murmured in my ear. I felt like I was about to explode. I looked at her fingers as it were moving down from my stomach to my wetness, then around to—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
