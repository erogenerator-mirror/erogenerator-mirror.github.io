The woman shrugged, thinking that there was nothing at all going on.</p> <p>"You can get there, I think. We'll leave it up to you. And I'll call for an Uber. We drive to the pub." The man got off their car, turned the key, and stepped out of the vehicle. There was a loud slap as his fist connected with that hand.</p> <p>The taxi drove off and the woman got into the back seat, her hands on the steering wheel. She started to cry. The taxi stopped for a while at the other side of the street. Then they got out and walked across the street. It was dark behind the two figures.</p> <p>The woman looked at him, then said. "If you're really so sure. I can drive. But...I just wanted to tell you not to try to get in or anything."</p> <p>"Why don't we just walk to this pub? Just a regular part of the city." The man got out of the car and walked around, and got them into the passenger seat.</p> <p>"Why wouldn't you just let me up to this pub? I'll make us two drinks and I can just get out of here..." The woman said.</p> <p>"Oh no, I don't think that's necessary. It's almost too noisy, and too much fun being alone. Please. Come on, let's go. You can even come with us. You're going to walk with your mother." The man agreed." Just leave your mother alone and we'll call for a taxi after we get back." The woman looked like she felt like crying and said, "But you have to come with us. We'll follow." "Ok, thank you." The man got himself into the back of the vehicle, got an ear-piercing headache, and got out of the vehicle.</p> <p>The taxi driver opened the front door for them.</p> <p>"Please. You'll be alright, you know." the man said gently, in a tone of concern.</p> <p>"What happened up there?" the woman asked.</p> <p>"We'd said the taxi was running and we couldn't pay the driver." The man nodded to the man, who got a piece of paper in his hand and handed it to the woman.</p> <p>"That's okay. And...I mean, please call the taxi." The woman nodded and handed the paper back to the man. "You'll get money when we leave." He said, shaking his hand again.</p> <p>"Yes. I will. Thank you." The woman, looking at the man's face as it went through his heart, replied.</p> <p>"I'll just wait, please." The woman said, her eyes going down his body, looking at the bulge between his legs, then back up at the man. Then, she looked at her hand. "He seems nice."</p> <p>The man looked at her, smiled, and then waved them off, giving her a smile of his own. He turned and left the taxi cab. They got their drinks and went outside, not saying very much.</p> <p>"You're really strange. I don't think I could handle myself if we were really together. I'm not exactly certain if we could keep it quiet. Even with the taxi driver, I think I could get in trouble." the woman said. "The taxi driver was a bit strange, I think. What could he do to me?" The man sighed. "Anyway, I had no idea. Thank you for making it."</p> <p>They went through the back streets and to the pub. The taxi driver bought them an American tote, and they each a drink. They walked into the bar. It was quite crowded. Their waiter had arrived a moment before.</p> <p>"Can I order two more for me?" he offered.</p> <p>"Certainly." The woman smiled, taking the drinks. "So what are your impressions?" he asked.</p> <p>"Not really, just what you did last night"</p> <p>The man smiled and nodded. "And that was only one of them.</p> <p>What you and your mother did was so wrong..." The man's voice trailed away, and the woman smiled.</p> <p>"What I mean was, that once you've had enough drugs, you should be able to get more. I mean, have a couple more and then we could be together. Just one more." He said.</p> <p>The man nodded. "What do you mean?" They were enjoying themselves, enjoying the conversation.</p> <p>"You should be a bit more daring.
