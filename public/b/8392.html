My hips lifted and I took him in me in one motion. He started to pump into me. It was an impossible job without an orgasm. My tits hung from my chest, swinging in rhythmless circles under his. His thrusts brought me closer and closer to that edge of orgasm.</p> <p>"Oh shit! I'm coming, damn it!"</p> <p>"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"</p> <p>I felt my orgasm explode all around me. The wave surged to the surface. I lost it and I felt the sweat run down my tits, into my armpits and down my ass crack. I screamed into Jason's face, my back arching and quaking. His cock throbbed deep within. He kissed and licked my nipples and I ran my fingers down his back. I ran my hands over his ass.</p> <p>"That was great! That was awesome!" Jason managed before his knees got weak and he fell to the bed and I was on top of him, still quivering from the waves exploding my body.</p> <p>I rolled off him. I wiped my hair back from my face and looked at the man he'd just fucked for the second time in less than a minute. I rolled the condom off his cock and lay next to him. I kissed his mouth and tasted his cum in it, and I smiled.</p> <p>"So, you did something special for me!"</p> <p>"Yeah, I think there's more. Did you fuck me good?"</p> <p>"I guess so, in the best way."</p> <p>"Let's get in the shower together?"</p> <p>"You got a water cap, don't you?"</p> <p>"Sure. Can you turn on the water and get out here."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>The water ran hot. A tingly sensation ran through my body. He came up behind me rubbing his still semi-hard cock between my buttocks. I felt good. Jason had just been inside of me. He pressed on the wall and let his lips caress my neck, nibbling and sucking and kissing with his lips. I groaned and rolled over, pushing back hard. He knelt by the side of me. His cock bobbed in front of me.</p> <p>"Yeah," I said softly, "you got a nice big cock."</p> <p>"No, wait. It's not that big."</p> <p>"It's pretty big, isn't it?"</p> <p>"Yeah," I said, "I saw how big it was."</p> <p>I looked into his eyes and saw sadness and loss. He took the condom off one of his legs and threw it on the floor. I moved my hands up his chest. He leaned into me, and when the water was turned up he pressed his lips to mine. I felt his hand caress my back and a hand stroke the side of my breast. I smiled and pulled away.</p> <p>"We better get in the shower, before Jason gets all pissed on."</p> <p>I was in the shower when Jason returned. He tossed the condom aside and pulled on his own. "You're lucky I'm clean."</p> <p>I smiled and let the water run down over my body. It felt good.</p> <p>***</p> <p>When Saturday finally arrived, I was all sweaty and dirty. I cleaned myself up while Jason helped me in the shower. I let him wash my hair. He rubbed soap on my skin, washing away the soap residue and making me feel the need to wash every inch of my body. I loved being in Jason's hands. If I had any doubts I let them drop.</p> <p>We got dressed and we sat out back, eating dinner out of a buffet on the veranda overlooking the pool. We talked about our day and other things. We both knew that it would be a long night. We talked about our week. We talked about Jason. I was so happy to see him, to see him again. How could he have gone with me on this.</p> <p>"Jason, do you know you're in love with me again?"</p> <p>"We had sex the second time," he said seriously, "in the living room."</p> <p>"No," I protested, "you're just not in the right frame of mind."</p> <p>"I'm in love with you, Sarah."</p> <p>I sighed. "No, I am in love with you, Jason."</p> <p>"Then maybe you're right. Maybe we should never have done this."</p> <p>I turned on the light and stared at the two of us for a long time. I couldn't see Jason's face, which I knew he was thinking of. I couldn't speak.</p> <p>"Jason, do you still feel the same way about me?"</p> <p>Jason blushed and looked away.
