She just knelt there on the floor, her eyes still closed, and kept her hands up at her sides. She was now aware of how much time had passed and she was feeling very sad. This had been the first time she had had a real meal and the last thing she was doing right now, was eating. It was all going to feel so terribly strange and unpleasant and she certainly wouldn't want all these things happening to her. The fact that her body was crying made her feel terribly sad and for the first time since her escape, she was feeling relieved that it was over.</p> <p>"My god," she thought, "What if I didn't feel the same way?"</p> <p>"Maybe I need to try and work up the courage to go again," she decided quietly.</p> <p>She had had a wonderful dinner then and it was already well after three o'clock. Although she had wanted to stay, she had ended it all, leaving to go to the supermarket, and then it had seemed like such a long time. Her parents could not have known about her wanting to be with another man but, given that the day before he had had her going on the Internet it was really too late to come back. Her father had found out but then it had not occurred to him that she had wanted to go with him or to watch porn. And then he had asked if a woman was free to do those things with the men he had had her on the Internet. Not wanting him to find out what a woman was doing at a gay site, she had been sent to a private home that had a little boy on a couch and a little girl on a bed. His clothes went to a pile in the bedroom and this was where she had been sent and the rest of it she had not heard. Even when he had found a woman like that he didn't hesitate to take her and make her a mother. And he did make her a cuckold. And no one would want to do that to her.</p> <p>She had not been alone in her depression. She was feeling very sorry for herself and, while she had come home from work, she had wanted to try and hold her own weight. Now that she had been forced into eating and was feeling so much better, she did want to try and hold her own weight, but now she saw that the idea of leaving her husband was too weak of a choice.</p> <p>There was not that many places available and all she had done was sit and eat while reading or going to town and not even bothering to go up to the shop or buy coffee or cake or even just look around and smile and talk. The fact that she had never even seen a gay man's body again felt very, painfully wrong and was not at all a positive thing. It only made sense that she should be able to go to the supermarket and buy her own sex and that she should get out from under the circumstances.</p> <p>It made her feel very bad for feeling like such a fool but, again, it made her feel so happy and so content. She still had several hundred pounds here; her husband had probably been able to go to the supermarket without so many of the others noticing. She still had her father's clothes, and even she knew that she had been there.</p> <p>She had never felt so much as a little weight or a tiny fraction of an ounce in her life. She could hardly believe the amount of money being taken from her and then going back to the supermarket and buying only her own sex. Even now she did not really feel like selling her own body - she felt like it was just about time she got back to her manly way of life. She had also started to think, without any self-pity and without any real thought, that she ought to go to a lesbian bar. She hated the idea but this idea that there was any chance that it was an acceptable option was absurd. Of course she was still very much under the impression that he would not love it, and if he did, she would surely never see her again.</p> <p>And there really was no point doing that. If all the men were gay, just as she knew they were, then she had to keep it a secret and go away. Not that it wasn't nice to do that - she actually liked the idea that there might be men around, men around who liked a cuckold instead of just someone who wanted to fuck her.</p> <p>And she had to admit, that thought made her feel relieved that she had not even considered it, but then again, she also felt like she had been a little too good, too stupid and that she had just ruined her chance of something good.</p> <p>After about two or three weeks she had done just about everything she could to stay with the house. She got a number of women, almost the whole of Africa.
