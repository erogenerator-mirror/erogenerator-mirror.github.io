There was something else: the way you use your tongue in my mouth was different, too. But I think there was some deeper meaning there. Was that why it felt so good to have my cock inside you, or were feelings a bit foreign, and I didn't care? It was both.</p> <p>It was a bit of both, and neither of us wanted it to stop. We just kept going with it and exploring each other, but neither of us wanted to cum just yet. When we did, I kept kissing you, and I really loved to eat you out. I felt so sexy when you came, and you tasted just as amazing, if not even sweeter. You liked it. I loved being your lover. And it felt so nice to be doing something so special with my brother again. And it felt good to be your girlfriend. And I love you, too."</p> <p>"So how long were you two together this past week?" I asked.</p> <p>She gave me a sad look and answered, "Well, we broke up about six months ago. You?"</p> <p>"Yeah, just a week ago. I couldn't believe it. But yes: I was with him this week when he came by. It was wonderful. When I came home in the morning, I had the feeling that maybe we could start over. But we didn't. We couldn't. He really loves you and he never said that he wanted more of you that you did. We never even thought about another guy but we could still... well... we knew we'd be lovers. And he got so angry. We didn't make love then, we just talked and held each other and... well, we came together just for that reason. And I loved when he did that for you. But I guess that's part of it. Sometimes, it's not fair. I'm not sure how to explain it. What we do isn't fair."</p> <p>"The thing is, Jen, I'm a big girl now and you should know by now. I have a lot of love for men, but I've always thought that our relationship was special, when we were together. That we could be together. That we would always have each other's backs. And now... I got it. We are in love. And we aren't thinking about that. It's just what we want." I pulled her in for a hug and kissed her lips and cheek. "It's great to be your girlfriend."</p> <p>"But what about us?"</p> <p>"I told you that I love you. How do we break the cycle in our relationship? How do we break it for you?" I asked. "That's different. It's just sex."</p> <p>"It's been a while, so it hasn't been that long, that important. Sometimes, we can't. I don't mean not all at once this time, but it's also the same stuff. And when we're making love, I've never made love with a guy, but I'm still in love with him, and you can't get enough of me." She took a deep breath and told me, "He feels the same way about me too as he does about you. The way he makes love to me is the same shit we've seen on TV: the lovemaking is the same shit you saw on the Internet. We're like people with different kinds of passion." She looked at me then and said, "You see that?"</p> <p>"Maybe it's different, but I'll never understand the way I feel about all that."</p> <p>"That's okay. It's just sex for the fun of it." She paused again and said, "I don't really think we should take anything for granted; I just don't do things on my own. It's just like living with a parent. You can't just take things for granted."</p> <p>She saw my face get red and knew I'd said that. We were still kissing, and she ran her hands down my back and under my shirt. Her nails scratched me gently, as I continued massaging her back. I looked at my hands on her back. They were warm and beautiful and I couldn't get enough of them. She looked back and smiled at me again. I felt her tongue on my cheek and I shuddered as I realized there was something else that I liked. I wanted it badly right now, but I was afraid to do anything about it. So I looked around the room. Everyone was in various states of undress, and we had a couple, but we couldn't seem to fit. I looked around the bed and saw a number of pairs of eyes on our bed. One pair of eyes that had seen my love made love to me and one pair of eyes that had seen my mom make love with a girl, and now saw my brother's cock in person, and I wanted himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
