I heard you had a real hot chick on your desk," said Lila as she sat back down with a big contented sigh.</p> <p>I got in front of her and said slowly and deliberately, "I didn't have her name but the two guys who helped me at the end of the day would have done very well for me." That was it for me; a moment that would forever be burned in my memory.</p> <p>That next day I asked her if you still had that wild-haired guy, who worked in a book store who I picked up on the coffee machine when I left to come back."</p> <p>"I did, but I never got to the point where I had any hope," I said with a smile.</p> <p>"That's not entirely true as well. The guy I picked up at lunch today was a guy I met in a coffee shop after I had been working there for a week."</p> <p>"Oh, so now we have a story," I said with a cheeky smile as my face reddened a little. She couldn't quite believe she had gotten fucked by that guy, which was just about every morning for a week she kept in her closet.</p> <p>Lila looked at me and I knew immediately that she had been there, she had been looking right at me when I was doing some of the work.</p> <p>"Oh no! Your face was there," she said with a sigh. "You have to look at my face to have a clue that that happened."</p> <p>I looked at her with my face as well as my upper lip, I could still see a little of my life, even though it had gone on far longer than would've been expected.</p> <p>"I am glad I was given that chance," I said and I leaned over to give her a big hug, then a very long one. Lila seemed a little taken away, but somehow it added to what Lila had been feeling for the evening.</p> <p>When we finished our hug, I leaned back and she said, "I'm glad you didn't lose your virginity to that other guy." We were standing at the checkout with the money ready in each of our hands. "Maybe it was a one time thing, but one time you could have had lots of guys and plenty of fun."</p> <p>"Let's make that one memory with another person first," I suggested.</p> <p>Lila looked at me with a smile and said, "I would say you already got that one memory with someone else."</p> <p>"I'm thinking of keeping these memories," I said with a laugh.</p> <p>Lila gave me her cell phone number and a number to call if I was interested. Later we said it was a date and went our separate ways the last time we were together. I was beginning to really like her.</p> <p>*â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
