They wanted to be my wife. They made me feel alive as they saw me walking down the empty drive. The women at first said they were not interested in fucking and that they all wanted to marry me so they could have their own private life. It seemed odd to me now that my marriage to them was ending. I wondered what my wife's real name, and all other possible names I would be living in, would like. Would her actual name be Elizabeth? Would she really call me her husband?</p> <p>After a brief pause, I heard a soft voice from behind me. It sounded like my wife's. "Well, how was the drive?"</p> <p>I turned to see my wife standing on the top of the rise. I noticed that she was wearing an identical outfit except for the tight fitting top and denim skirt, and the heels. My wife had a very sexy face. Her hair was still damp from some shower she had given me when I got home from school in the morning. She was dressed in white tights, an ivory satin bra that cupped her breasts so nicely, and she had her legs crossed as she leaned over the railing. As she reached for the rail, I could see part of her breast, and the pink and black lace top was pulled almost up to expose her nipple, which was hardening with desire. There was something different about her hair, but I could only assume that she chose to stay put for now. Our eyes were locked together on each other, as my heart was beating fast like a bass drum by the sounds of the rap music.</p> <p>When the door to our bedroom opened, I heard a male voice speaking to my ex, and, after a little pause on the way, my wife walked in. "Well, I was wondering if you could join me downstairs. I am going for a smoke, and, yes I would like to see you."</p> <p>I looked confused. She said, "I guess you don't think that I would like being out in the morning in my new clothes,"</p> <p>"Well, uh, maybe it would be ok." I was feeling very nervous as my heart still beat fast. I was standing on the tarmac. It was the first time I saw my naked wife standing at the edge of the airport. She had turned slightly and leaned towards the gate, as though she wanted to catch a glimpse of me. I felt my heart skip a beat with fear and excitement, and a deep flush covered my cheeks.</p> <p>My wife was sitting in the passenger seat of a gray limousine, and she had pulled her skirt up and her legs apart, to give me a clear view of her glistening wet pussy lips. She looked into my eyes as she stroked her finger tip around her breast. "I am going to be the wife of this man, for the next three years as we marry. If I say I want to go on a cruise, I am going to ask for his permission. I want to watch him fuck you."</p> <p>I felt my cock rising in my pants. I wanted to feel the heat of my own wife's body against mine, and the feel of her breasts pressed against my chest. "So, you would consider being my wife?" I asked sarcastically.</p> <p>My wife smiled and said, "Oh, honey, that is so nice of you. Of course I wouldn't have married you, if it were anybody but you."</p> <p>I felt a little embarrassed as I said it, but my cock stiffened as it did so many times today. I felt an erection growing up in my trousers just looking at my sexy wife. My wife's eyes were locked onto mine, as she reached down and slid her skirt slowly upward. They were the same eye candy. I thought she may have been checking to see if I was looking at her legs or at her breasts, and maybe she knew I was.</p> <p>My wife looked right at me and said, "Do you like what you see my husband? Do you?" I was too nervous to answer.</p> <p>My eyes were on my wife's face as she stood in the doorway. My wife was about 5'6", and her legs were parted. Her breasts were still contained by the top of her bra, but my eyes were now devouring the curve of her ass. She turned away from me slightly as she put both hands on her butt cheeks. I could see the top of her stockings peaking between the tops of her gorgeous legs. Then she turned around and looked at me over her shoulder as she turned toward her seat and began to unbuckle my belt.</p> <p>"Do you feel better, handsome?" she asked, as she unbuttoned my pants. I shook my head as I stood there, in complete shock. My cock grew as I watched as she slid the pants down over my hips.
