Her eyes opened wide.</p> <p>“Come in, come in,” I said as I entered the big bedroom. “Close the door and come right down,” I added as I motioned for her to pull the top sheet off the king sized bed.</p> <p>Taking a seat, Sam sat on the edge of the bed and stared at the ceiling. She was wearing a sheer pink camisole with a slit up the left side. Underneath her top was a black lace bra that pushed her breasts up and out dramatically. I was mesmerized at her size. When she stood up and took off her top, the top gaped open and gave me a nice view of her breasts. Her nipples stuck out like pencil erasers and I wondered about them. Sam looked around the room, taking in the furnishings, the room, her appearance. I started to wonder if she was a lesbian too, but she sat next to me and took a look at me.</p> <p>She looked at my crotch, my cock. She looked up, my eyes going up and down her body. The top she was wearing was only barely covering her nipples and a dark strip was covering her pussy. She was clearly aroused. She reached out her hand to me and I held it. Sam looked to be a bit overwhelmed, which I was, looking down at her chest and then looked up at me.</p> <p>“No, don’t, I have to do it.” I finally said, breaking the trance Sam was on.</p> <p>“But you already have, you just don’t have any clothes on.” She said.</p> <p>“No, I have an outfit, I am nude if I must.” I said, trying to make light of the situation.</p> <p>“I have to too.” She said, shaking her head.</p> <p>I was a bit surprised, but at the same time, I couldn’t really feel that I had to do it. I stood up and followed her back to the bed to get a good look at Sam’s outfit, not even bothering to say a word about her body. It fit her like a glove, as if she had been designed. The bra barely covered the top of her breasts, making the tops of her areola, and nipples look a mile long. The hem of the camisole was only a touch shorter than the bottom, but when you looked at her, you could even tell her pussy was shaved completely bare. Sam’s face was flushed and she looked almost beautiful.</p> <p>“But you can’t. You’re not dressed like that. You’re not a woman and you’re not some sexual object.” I said. “I can’t do this without you.”</p> <p>Sam sat up and looked at me. “I thought I was the only one who said it. Do it.”</p> <p>I knew the answer. Sam slid off the bed and walked to the big dresser drawers. In her room, Sam removed a couple of robes, opened them to see if she had time. She pulled them off, tossing them to me as we sat on the bed. Sam turned around slowly this time, but after a few seconds, the robe fell away, revealing just a pair of panties. Sam’s hips were slightly swaying and she had an evil grin on her face. “You are the one, aren’t you?” I started to take off my shirt.</p> <p>“Yes,” she laughed. “The one for you, is your present!”</p> <p>“Okay,” I replied, and began to strip. Sam was still watching me. Taking my time, I began by peeling off my socks. All of them too.</p> <p>Sam stood in front of the dresser and watched as I did it, her smile growing, knowing exactly how she looked. I had finally found my present. I lifted one foot and removed my socks and socks once again, laying them on the dresser, not bothering to take off the panties. Sam was standing still as she watched. With my feet still on the bed, Sam bent over and pulled off her panties, tossing them to me to toss aside. I was so turned on watching the skimpy material that I could feel my cock throbbing with excitement.</p> <p>Sam turned and faced the dresser. I looked down at Sam, standing there in her lingerie. Sam looked at me, her eyes wide, as if unsure how to react to what I had done. She took a step forward and leaned over the dresser. I sat there, unable to do anything. There was no stopping me now. I leaned forward and—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
