The last stop of the evening was the mall. We walked along side it for a short time. In addition to the mall, we walked on a trail. After we made the turn down a path that had a waterfall, it turned to a dirt path. We began to walk slowly, the clouds just beginning to begin to open. The sky was clear and clear.</p> <p>"Momma told me your momma wants you to take a swim in the waterfall," she said.</p> <p>I took off my t-shirt and lay on the grass on my stomach. I looked up at the large trees with a few faint stars and was thankful that there was no one around to see me. As I continued to watch the clouds the clouds began to open up. It looked a bit more yellow in the sun. It actually looked kind of nice. It seemed almost like a blue moon. It was perfect.</p> <p>I lay on my stomach feeling the water fall on my back and shoulders. There was even some light outside now. The rain that was falling on and on seemed to be slowing just a little. The drops seemed to have lost their pace. I could see how big the water was beginning to disappear.</p> <p>I looked over my shoulder to watch a large rock slide down onto the ground around my feet. It looked like two small drops came up and made a small hole in the rock. They had fallen on the ground just above my feet and formed a large hole in the rock.</p> <p>"Do you like to swim?" I asked.</p> <p>She laughed. "Only when it's sunny and warm in here," she answered.</p> <p>"It's nice that way," I said.</p> <p>"Yes, it is," she replied. "What time is it?"</p> <p>"7:00 pm," I said, trying to maintain my normal tone of voice.</p> <p>"7:00 pm?" she said.</p> <p>"Yeah," I answered. "We could go have lunch and then you can come back in here for the rest of the weekend," I replied.</p> <p>"Okay," she said. "That sounds great."</p> <p>Just as we were about to say goodbye, a large boulder slid down on the ground onto the muddy rock. It seemed to be coming down just below my feet. It was several inches or so down on the ground so that my feet actually landed on it. I was so glad to see no one else around. I knew that we would have to swim if we wanted to get any rest at all that we were going to swim in the waterfall.</p> <p>I looked toward the hole and saw that it had not closed. I looked to the side and realized that our water was not coming back to the ground. It had just sunk down below the surface. I began to say something, but her laugh silenced me. I stood up to move away from the rock that she had fallen on. I walked away from her toward the entrance of the cave.</p> <p>I knew she must have heard me because her laughter sounded like it came from no other direction than where I had left my feet. I began to get out of the rock when she came toward me. She pulled her arm back to stop me and I realized that she had grabbed the rock and had thrown it into the rock. I reached down and grabbed her shoulders. She began to pull her arm away from mine. We looked at each other for a moment, both of us realizing that we wanted each other.</p> <p>We began to laugh at our little joke. She was the first to ask. "How long will we be like that?" she finally asked.</p> <p>"We probably won't be able to swim anymore," I answered. "We have lots of time to swim."</p> <p>She looked at me questioningly and I looked back at her. "But, if we don't swim and it makes our legs hurt, we'll be stronger," she said.</p> <p>"I think that it's an idea." I said. "You're my best friend and we should work out this kind of thing."</p> <p>She smiled and nodded affirmatively. As she stood and pulled her T-shirt over her head, she reached down to pull her shorts up. She then began to pull them down, lifting them high enough to stop at her thighs. She lowered herself slightly, raising her buttocks enough to remove them completely.</p> <p>She stood back up. "That was funny. You are still my friend."</p> <p>"That's just what we have in mind. We've still got time," I answered. "I still have to go back and wash my shoes tomorrow."</p> <p>I followed her out of the cave and went back into the woods. We walked around a small clearing and sat down on the grass. We both stood and walked around in the darkness a little longer.
