She'd taken her cell phone to her dresser, but she couldn't find it.</p> <p>"What's wrong?"</p> <p>"Nothing, I just got really tired of being home this time of year," she said.</p> <p>"Why didn't your mom call?"</p> <p>"We're just in another marriage now."</p> <p>"I wish I could make that a permanent thing."</p> <p>"You have a right to have your life get better."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"You need to know that it's important for us to have a relationship outside the traditional ways."</p> <p>"Are we done?"</p> <p>"Maybe," she said. "But we have to talk about this."</p> <p>After some time passed, I asked her if she'd like to come to my house for dinner. I had no reservations. But the kids were busy in Europe and I didn't have a free time.</p> <p>"I don't think so. You can't have a house with my kids!" she insisted with a smirk.</p> <p>"Why not? They have no need for one," I said. "Why don't you come tonight?"</p> <p>"You know you hate this."</p> <p>"I know, I know, I'm just not ready."</p> <p>"Don't be silly," she said. I'm not that kind of woman, and besides the two of us can play, but we shouldn't be discussing this."</p> <p>"Okay, but don't call me, okay? I'll call you, okay?"</p> <p>"You don't have to call me!" she said.</p> <p>"Yes I do," I promised her. She got up to go into the bathroom. I got up right away when I heard the bedroom door close. I walked to the door, and I could see in her face that she was crying.</p> <p>"I don't know what to do," I said, afraid to bring up the topic. I knew I should have said she shouldn't have dated him, but there was no harm being done. I wasn't ready to see my best friend's parents, and I probably wouldn't be happy with the marriage the next night, but I'd never seen my dad so sad.</p> <p>"Honey," I said, kissing her cheek. I closed the door, and she looked up at me and I saw what she meant.</p> <p>"That's so sorry," I said.</p> <p>"I know it's hard but..."</p> <p>"But? But you know it's okay. You need it. You're beautiful." I gave her a hug for courage and a kiss on the lips. "It's okay. I'm sure you'll find someone just as beautiful if you let go."</p> <p>She gave me a small smile as she left the room. I was still in a daze from my trip to Italy. The rest of the week passed by uneventfully. I hadn't seen her since Sunday.</p> <p>On Thursday, the children arrived that evening. We met at one of the neighbor's houses and we sat around dinner chatting. It was a pleasant dinner.</p> <p>Our last course came and we sat talking about nothing important for the next couple of hours. I didn't say anything. I'm not even sure what I was thinking. We went back into the living room where my wife came out again. We sat talking about our trip, with what happened there.</p> <p>Finally, after several cocktails and a lot of small talk, my wife got up to go to the bathroom. A minute later my wife exited the room and came back in.</p> <p>"Thank you, Honey."</p> <p>"For what?"</p> <p>"I mean, just for being there," she said. "If you don't want to see me again, I understand."</p> <p>"I don't want to see you again," I said. "But we need more time, don't we?"</p> <p>"Yes, now it's just a matter of when, not when, I guess," she said.</p> <p>"Okay, I understand," I said. "But we need to talk. You can't go to Italy without getting tested." I had no idea what to expect. I thought I'd have a better chance at seeing my best friend after her marriage. I had no doubt she was going to come back. I didn't want to risk losing her.</p> <p>"Okay," she said. "I got tested in my last marriage," she said. "But it's not that I'm really happy with the relationship that we have...I guess I've made up my mind," she said. "But we both have to get tested," she said.</p> <p>I sat there stunnedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
