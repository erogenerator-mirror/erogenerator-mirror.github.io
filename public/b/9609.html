My friend had done what she had wanted to do for me last month. When I did ask her for more sex, she had said it was all she could handle. Well, it was a bit better than that.</p> <p>"It can start with something. Something nice to get started, if you're interested." She giggled.</p> <p>That brought my attention to her. She was lying on her back, splayed out before me like an advertisement for a real good show. Her feet were curled underneath her body, and her hands were clasped behind her head, which she was just smiling at. I thought for a moment:</p> <p>"And it can go on all night long. If it doesn't, I think I'll go back and watch it now."</p> <p>"And if you don't want to, that's ok."</p> <p>I did. I didn't want to be a burden on our relationship. I wanted to make her happy.</p> <p>I turned my attention back to the road and my dick was still rock hard. The light went on and I pulled onto my sister's driveway and parked. I sat for a moment, feeling the warmth that was building between us.</p> <p>"See, I know," she teased.</p> <p>"Yeah you did though...you know, it's just been a hell of a month since our last date," I joked.</p> <p>There was no way I was going to let that go.</p> <p>"Yeah, well, we're not going home for dinner, just to fuck. That's all. And, besides, I've got dinner planned for later..."</p> <p>All day long! But at home that night, I didn't even think about this happening.</p> <p>*************</p> <p>Later that night, we had been playing Frisbee around our house for maybe half an hour. I had been thinking a lot about what had happened with my sister, and it came back to me quickly. I'd seen her naked the day before, and I liked what I saw. So my thoughts had changed to something more...something sexy.</p> <p>The night was warm and muggy, and the house smelled of her after sex. As usual, it was crowded, and no one was getting very close to us, I thought if I looked hard enough, I could see her. I didn't try to hide my excitement, though!</p> <p>"Mmm, so you're sure about something?" She asked.</p> <p>"Y-y-yes. Let's see what this has us ready!..." I replied.</p> <p>Well, I couldn't see her very well, but I definitely could have. Just as she turned on the light, it hit me that what she'd said was something that had not taken place months, since we'd been dating.</p> <p>"Merry Christmas, sweetheart!" I smiled.</p> <p>The sun was setting and the house was dark. There was no one home. We watched the moon rise above the streetlight, and the silence was thick. We had a perfect view of her beautiful body from the front porch, which was partially illuminated by the flickering lights. She turned her head to see if anyone was around, but no one was.</p> <p>It was only as she turned back that I got an idea.</p> <p>"Can I just sit down?" she asked.</p> <p>"Sure babe," I said.</p> <p>We sat down and she looked around nervously, trying to look natural. But the only light in the house was her figure in the moonlight, like a painting in the wall. I felt as though being in the house with her would make me feel even more uncomfortable, and I wasn't willing to risk it.</p> <p>"You know, this has been a long time since we've done anything," I explained to her.</p> <p>She said nothing but smiled, not even flinching a bit.</p> <p>"Mmh, well let me get back to bed!" She said.</p> <p>The house was dark and we sat there looking at each other, and both starting to get nervous.</p> <p>I started to get up, and she took my hand and helped me stand up. I felt a bit awkward walking around the house naked, but she had a point. I was naked in front of a girl with whom I'd lost a good year of affection, and had felt nothing but lust for her. She had felt nothing but love for me, and I could sense her closeness to me.</p> <p>Without another word, she took my hand and led me to the bedroom, leaving my arm behind my back.</p> <p>"Have a seat," she whispered.</p> <p>With all of the confidence I'd felt during our recent time together, I sat down, unsure of whatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
