I went quickly to the door of the hotel and rang the bell. She answered the door, a broad smile on her face. She did look very good. She was wearing a summer dress that was very low cut in front, showing off much of her wonderful assets, and she came to the door wearing the diamond necklace that was there when I bought her. It only fit around her neck, because, as I had told her, she was only a couple of inches shorter. Her smile widened as she took me into her arms saying, "I'll see you later." Then, she kissed me long and firmly on the mouth, her tongue pressing against my lips.</p> <p>"Will you be going out with Mr. P?" We broke our kiss and she said, "Do I have to be out to dinner with our son?" I told her that I would love nothing more than to be alone with her, but then I added, "The hotel manager told me that I would have to stay in a room until I'm ready, until you know where you are." Her hand went to my head and gently, slowly, she pulled me into the warm, soft embrace that we had shared over the last year, and then, pulling apart, she smiled.</p> <p>"Well, dear, I'm going to have to say good-bye to the manager," she said, "but we can go grab dinner."</p> <p>She kissed me again, this time hard. "Oh, that feels so good," she said, "I'm sure you'll have quite a time this evening. I have an even better idea. You can come down to the motel while I take a shower. It's always my favorite place, to undress, get into bed, and enjoy a woman's touch for the rest of the evening."</p> <p>I had no objection to that idea, and that was the end of the conversation as well. As I drove down the short drive to the resort, she got out of the taxi and kissed me deeply.</p> <p>I didn't do anything to deter her, and we quickly undressed in our home bathroom and took our shower together. We showered and I thought that my erection wouldn't show at first, but as it got bigger, I found it hard to hide. We toweled off together and she sat on the edge of our large king sized bed and pulled me down as I kissed her in all her erogenous zones with the same ferocity that I had just given her. She put a finger to my lips, stopping me, and said, "Just lie back and enjoy. It's not every day that you get to meet a gorgeous lady who takes full advantage of your body!"</p> <p>At first I just lay on my back, contented to let her remove her dress and bra, but then I could feel her standing over me, her breasts pressing into me. She kissed my face, then reached down between us, pulled my throbbing member toward her opening, and slowly began to lower herself. "Be a good boy, and wait for me," she said in her sexy voice while taking slow, full movements against me, teasing me with the slick wetness of her pussy as a precursor to what was about to happen. She rubbed me all around her entrance, slowly making sure I would slide in slowly, taking her time, enjoying the sensation of being opened as she teased me, making me more and more hard and very ready for her.</p> <p>I was afraid that all I could do was let my thoughts get back to the woman, to what she was doing to me, that I was going to come as she teased me. She stopped teasing me just a little. "I thought you'd never come," she said, as her hand went to my shaft, and she stroked me, taking a good grip and looking over at me with a knowing smile. "Is that all you can do, dear?" she said with a sexy smile and a wink, "Because, sweetie, all of you, I want it, now."</p> <p>I thought that I had known her long enough to realize how sexy she was and how much she had enjoyed the evening without her husband present, but I quickly found out! Her hand was running lightly up and down my cock, slowly, tantalizingly teasing me, making me so hard that I knew I would probably explode anytime soon. When her eyes closed, she took me completely in her hands and said, "I love you, Bill, love you more than anything. It's really about you making sure that I'm safe and that you have a good long time to come," she leaned down and kissed me again, hard on the mouth, making me moan and cry out. "I love you so much," she said. Then she kissed me hard again and pulled herself off me.</p> <p>Sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
