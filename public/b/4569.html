I'm sure you're having a good time."</p> <p>"Oh yes, I am but...I've got a date with this handsome new coach and I've made plans with her tonight."</p> <p>"Oh yes, it's too late." John said. "She's very beautiful and you've been a good sport about this morning..."</p> <p>"But what am I supposed to do? I don't remember her coming up here..."</p> <p>"You aren't supposed to ever worry about that, and it's not like we'll be caught."</p> <p>"It's just... I...what if it was my first time."</p> <p>"I doubt it would be, and besides the coach is very friendly. And she might make the best excuse to meet you..."</p> <p>"What does she say?" John asked.</p> <p>"Well I have to assume..."</p> <p>"Yes you do." Then there's always that, and this is how it will be for me." John said with a sly grin.</p> <p>"And do what?"</p> <p>"Take her."</p> <p>"I'll be watching you and when you say her name I want you to take care of her. You'll need to be gentle with her. Take it easy with her." She replied.</p> <p>John took hold of her hand with his free hand and he pulled her into place with him, the two kissed passionately, her hands moving as hers did to wrap around his waist.</p> <p>"Now that I can hold you, where do we go from here?" He asked.</p> <p>"Well I thought we could go for dinner."</p> <p>"Dinner and maybe then we'll go have a movie?"</p> <p>"Maybe we could go to a movie." She replied</p> <p>"I'm not sure which movie it is, but I think I like Italian."</p> <p>"You're right about that. I like Italian. Who knows what it'll be?"</p> <p>"Ok, we'll just go for dinner and watch a movie."</p> <p>John laughed as he took her hand but when the two kissed again his breath turned to steel as he pulled down her blouse. She had a soft and lovely large B-cup that would look great in the movie, he thought and he loved to watch the other girls tits when he watched her. When he saw her chest start to move under those thin and thin fabric he knew she was no tease. She pushed those white cotton ones up her body until they were on display with her breasts. John groaned when they started to swell as his eyes were riveted to them. She kept that up as they got her jeans down around her thighs. Her dark brown thighs that were so tan and soft just begging to be touched. There was no mistake, she was beautiful, and his heart started to race as his mind reeled.</p> <p>"Are you sure about going? I don't know..." John started to say.</p> <p>"I want to be sure and as far as you know yes I am. Now I'm yours."</p> <p>With that he began to undo the buttons of her top, he stared at her breasts with appreciation. After a few seconds he slipped his hands up her legs to find her panties. He tugged and yanked at them till his hands were able to get them off easily. They were like a delicate cloth hanging off a shelf. His eyes darted to the nipples which were hard and pushing against the fabric of her brassiere. He tugged and rolled them as he began to kiss her breasts the whole time he was tugging and pulling at her bra.</p> <p>"Come with me so we do it right." He crooned over her breasts as he took the rest of her panties off. When she was standing he was in front of her when he was taking her bra off, she was almost completely naked now as he pulled the straps off her shoulders. She loved his attention to her large and full breasts and had one of those moments when he would gently cup and squeeze them as his tongue would lick her nipples into a frenzy. His hands went to her waist with the strength and expertise he had to get her body naked and fast. The rest of her body was also quite naked but she let them rest just above the waistline of her jeans and his.</p> <p>She had removed her jeans in the kitchen but only a thin black satin thong sat in his lap when he pulled them off. The thin triangle of satin was cut in a circle of tiny white lace that ended a little off by the white of her pussy hair. The thin strip of white lace was almost as thin as her panties and it ran from her hips to the top of her slit. John felt the soft material when he pushed it between her legs in a slow, rhythmic motion.
