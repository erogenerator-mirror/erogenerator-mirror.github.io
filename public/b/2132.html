You must have it on the Internet, we're here waiting," she yelled, "I know how to do these things too." She turned and walked away into the bedroom.</p> <p>He stood there waiting to see if her was alright but she sat on one of the beds.</p> <p>She said "It's a girl friend with my sister at home" as she handed him a piece of paper.</p> <p>He started to open it when she pulled it back and said, "You are a handsome man, and I am very flattered. "</p> <p>"Thank you. "</p> <p>She had a small smile but it was barely more than a grimace.</p> <p>He opened the other side and read it. "Hi. "</p> <p>They both froze and she laughed, a little.</p> <p>"Don't just stare at me. I've always wanted you to stare at me when we were around each other. "</p> <p>He blushed and stammered out "Well, what about me? "</p> <p>"What would you say if I said I had to wear pajamas and a T? "</p> <p>"Well, aren't you glad we came over? You're so beautiful that I could kiss you all night long. "</p> <p>She laughed again and continued to stare at him and said,</p> <p>"Come on, let me show you something."</p> <p>She ran back to grab the pajamas but when she came back around to him, he was sitting facing her. She walked back over to him and put her arms around him and gave him a gentle kiss on the lips.</p> <p>"I have a wonderful surprise for you. Go get that wine. "</p> <p>When she had gone, he just turned to her and said,</p> <p>"You know me too well already, aren't you? "</p> <p>"Well, if you want to be very good at this, let's try another beer."</p> <p>When she returned, they both drank and she said,</p> <p>"It's very warm out tonight. Would you like to go upstairs, and just lie down on the floor?"</p> <p>"Let's just do it. "</p> <p>She kissed him again, this time a bit more passionately than the first one, and said, "Here's a nice king-sized bed that I might be able to share with you. "</p> <p>He looked at her and said, "I know I want to. But it's also pretty warm in here, and I'll just need a robe. "</p> <p>Their talk of his fantasy was interrupted by an urgent knocking on the door. She went back to the bed and he quickly got on and pulled his robe on and then stood there. She looked at him and said,</p> <p>"Do you mind if I ask you to join me for a quickie?"</p> <p>He said,</p> <p>"Sure but you must come to the bathroom first. "</p> <p>She got up and came out of the room, handed him a robe and said,</p> <p>"It'll be my pleasure to come for a quickie."</p> <p>He just said,</p> <p>"Thank you. "</p> <p>She came to the bathroom and came out a few minutes later, slipped on the robe and left. He sat at the table drinking his beer and staring.</p> <p>"I saw your beautiful eyes, and you just smiled when you saw me. "</p> <p>He looked a bit embarrassed, but she said,</p> <p>"I think you like looking at me too. "</p> <p>He didn't say anything about it, just looked at her for a moment. He then said, "It's nice to meet a woman that is open to having sex with me."</p> <p>"I think I would have to have the wine," she said and went and got a bottle.</p> <p>They sat quietly and talked for a bit, and she began to tell him about the wonderful feelings she experienced when she kissed him. He told her about her day in the school field, the classes in her chemistry class, her friends and family all came to be there. About the first few days she had no time to herself, but the next few days were her last day, and then she joined the cheer squad that she had not met, and they continued to have a steady life. He told her that he would not have liked to be there and what they did for a living.</p> <p>She told him how she would try to show him off when they were together. He asked her if she would let him take pictures of her in her outfit. She agreed to the idea and she told him that she would try to help him with his poses. He told her that this would be the first "date" they'd ever have. She would just be there to pose for him and he would get to see more of her.
