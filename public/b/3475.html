While it was not as though it was a bad thing to be exposed, I suppose I could have just looked at her. I had to get over my attraction, though, and just went right back to the movie. She seemed to be watching the end with her eyes closed, and I could detect a slight movement in her movements as she was watching.</p> <p>"I guess this isn't your first time out here to have a threesome." She said, smiling, but not moving.</p> <p>"No, not in her eyes." I replied. She turned and looked over at me. I was suddenly getting an erection, but I tried to act like I did not know what she was thinking, I just kept looking up to see how she was. "She actually is watching my dick. Does that bother you?"</p> <p>She looked a little embarrassed, I mean she had a beautiful body, and that was one of the best things about her. "Well I know I'm not a prude, like you are." She replied.</p> <p>She then took the remote off the nightstand and looked at the movie. Not sure where to start, I was thinking she could actually see that I was staring and watching. But she sat back down as the previews rolled, obviously not realizing I was looking at her.</p> <p>It then hit me to feel nervous, nervous and unsure. And the first thought was that there were no feelings, just strangeness about the situation. For some reason, however, this woman was still obviously turned on, but there was a difference between two people who obviously seemed in a similar position or situation. I decided to put some thought into what the feelings were and try to find out from her as to how I felt. I tried not to get up to move the movie and watch the previews, but something was definitely there.</p> <p>As my eyes continued to scan the screen, I noticed an interesting couple in a movie on the screen and that her hand was underneath the blanket. She was rubbing her clit and running her fingers around her lips. In the dim light, I couldn't make her out as her eyes were closed and she started to rub her fingers. Her lips had parted slightly as she moaned and her mouth parted slightly. The movie was a little sexier than me, even after the first time watching that film.</p> <p>"My turn." she said as she got up, sliding her hands down her body and starting to undo her jeans. I was watching intently the movie, seeing the movie, and feeling my own body begin to react to what I was trying to do. I tried to move my hands back to keep those things from getting caught on my body, but the blanket would have kept my hands in place. "Go on." She replied in response. I reached my hand up, feeling the soft skin of her upper leg up to her thigh. I stopped for a moment to watch as she spread her legs apart, her right hand on her pussy. That was one of her hottest things to my opinion. Her hand started to work at her pussy as she started to make small circles across her clit.</p> <p>I couldn't tell if she was just rubbing her clit or was doing it to herself, or whether she was actually rubbing one of her fingers. Whatever it was, it felt good, and I could feel myself getting slightly harder. I felt as if I could probably cum, and I was ready to go in for the kill. I reached up to her chest, but she pulled away, turning with a look of shock and disappointment on her face.</p> <p>"You really don't want it, right?" she said, shaking her head, "you know I don't mind it, but I mean.... I need to go...." I reached for her, but she stepped aside.</p> <p>I had nothing else to do but follow her and leave quickly to go home. I went to the bathroom, took a shower and changed into some clothes, trying to put my mind on what had just happened, or better yet, trying to decide on whether it was a good idea to just leave and go home. As I came out, she was standing in the door to our bathroom. In one quick motion, all of my doubts were gone, and with one last look, I walked into the stall.</p> <p>"I have something to show you." There was a small box sitting there. "What is that?" I asked, getting down on my knees, grabbing the box and pulling out what looked like a necklace. "Here.....," I began, picking the necklace out of the box and opening it. "This is the only thing that makes up the entire set. And its all my own, so you'll just have to find a way to put it on you. Don't worry about it, though, I got it before it got aroundâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
