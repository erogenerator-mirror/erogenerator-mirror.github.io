If she gives you an answer, do you think that she has an idea? Or maybe just think of her as my little toy."</p> <p>It would make a great time for her to answer my question now. After all, that was my answer that she didn't need to know at all.</p> <p>It was not an easy answer for her, but I tried to make it as I could. "She's certainly not my little toy now, you know. It's that she only knows how to play with a penis, though. Is that right? You can still give her such a good impression?"</p> <p>"Aaaargh," she squealed suddenly. Her feet were locked on my buttocks, and my hands were all over her, pulling her into me. She could feel that I had a big erection trapped deep within her thighs, so she leaned in with a look of relief and eagerness in her eyes.</p> <p>"It's been quite a long time since I had a good feeling about you, my dear," I said, feeling it through her panties against my skin. "You're such a lovely pet. I'm glad we agreed that we hadn't made a deal about what names I chose to call you."</p> <p>"You made a deal with a boy? What's that mean?"</p> <p>"You got them to refer to me as "our boy"?" she asked. "And that I was your friend?"</p> <p>"Yes, they did. But not because I was your friend, just because they saw that I was your friend," I told her, looking over her head at the clock on the wall. Five minutes to arrive.</p> <p>As her feet sank in, I realized that I could actually get a girl to make that kind of a decision. I felt my penis jump a little in its arousal as I thought about such a scenario. It would be difficult to resist such a temptation.</p> <p>"I guess we'll just have to watch and learn from this time," I said, and we both laughed at that. The time was soon coming and it wasn't a race against time, but I had more or less been given the orders of my little girl over her head. She could not get away with making it in the first place.</p> <p>"I was right about that," I said. "You're going to have to help me with the other guests. You know, the one from the bedroom?"</p> <p>"Do you mean what I think you mean?" she asked, and I was taken aback.</p> <p>"Of course I do," was my reply. "I told you that I didn't care how you felt about having a cock in your mouth. The truth of the matter is that the boys like that."</p> <p>"Oh, but I like that a lot. It's really nice," she said. "Don't you think?"</p> <p>"I suppose you're right, my dear," I said, and we were silent for a few moments.</p> <p>"Maybe we should do something about it," she said, and I nodded.</p> <p>I sat down on the edge of her bed and pulled up her panties, and we started to stroke our cocks together. Our lips were very close, and I had to lean on her to reach her.</p> <p>When I put my hands in between her legs, it was like when she was wearing her panties, and I could even feel the wetness there. Her panties were damp but that didn't bother me because I knew that the feel of them was exactly what I wanted to do.</p> <p>"So you like this, don't you?" I heard her ask, and in reply, the young girl put her head on the pillow beside my shoulder and leaned on the edge of my bed.</p> <p>"Yes, it feels so good to have you touch my pussy like this. I'm so glad that you've joined me for the night. I can feel your hands touching me everywhere."</p> <p>I put my hands over her mound and her thighs, toying with her, as we explored each other's bodies with our hands. Her voice was a little different with each breath she took. It was very quiet, and at some level, I was pretty afraid that I might be falling over a bit of a cliff. I wasn't sure what was true about her, but if she was saying something, I don't know what I would say, so I told her so.</p> <p>"Do you like this?" I whispered in her ear. "This feels good? Do you like how it feels, my pet? Do I make you very excited and want to be pleased?"</p> <p>"Oh yes, of course, baby! I want you to touchâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
