He asked.</p> <p>"Well, you were in the shower, and I couldn't find my panties."</p> <p>"Hmm... That has nothing to do with any of that, does it?"</p> <p>"Only with panties," she said. "It's just that I have never... Well never... It's just that it kind of seems like it is with those things around."</p> <p>"So do I."</p> <p>I had never really been curious about sex, but I just had to ask her. "Is it with my hand in panties, I mean?"</p> <p>"What?" She said again, still confused.</p> <p>"I mean, you're not very hairy down there."</p> <p>She looked at me for a long moment and let her head drop again, as if I was speaking from the heart.</p> <p>"Hmmm," she said, with a little laugh and a tiny nod. "You could get me wet just talking about it."</p> <p>"You do have a nice, cute pussy, don't you? It just depends on the person you are talking to."</p> <p>"Well..."</p> <p>"No, not really, it's just that it's always just one person telling another person how they might be interested in another. Someone who knows you might do this kind of thing."</p> <p>She blushed again and looked away for a moment. It felt good to talk about it to someone I had never even been to on the phone before. I decided to let the subject go without comment.</p> <p>"So are you still here at the same school or did you move back home?" I asked.</p> <p>"That too," she said, still looking away. I had made her feel uncomfortable by telling her I was there, but I felt compelled to try.</p> <p>"So, is everything done with? Well, not sure that is happening, it's not like I'm a stranger in there with you."</p> <p>"Why not? You have to try and be more adventurous."</p> <p>"It kind of looks like it is." I said, trying to sound not too obvious, but trying to be nonchalant. "You can see the wet underwear, and I can see that it's already getting wet. I mean, I've never done that before. I'm not even sure I understand what it means to have your panties soaking through. I should go get another robe or something."</p> <p>"Nah, I think you're going to see one or two of the many ones here at the other school so you're going to have to go first. I just might try them on now in a different room." I told her.</p> <p>"That's my pleasure," she said, sitting down on the couch again. "Maybe I'll show you later, but right now I am thinking about you. I mean... I'm about to go off into the bathroom and just go to bed myself, but, um..." She trailed off for a moment and caught herself, trying to think of something else to say. She stood up again and took my hand.</p> <p>"I'm going to get you some of those new panties, too. Then we'll talk more about why you got rid of them."</p> <p>"Um, okay... Maybe I can..." She said, sitting up again.</p> <p>I sat the robe down and leaned over to get a closer look at her panties. When I got almost there, she looked down again.</p> <p>"So that was weird," she said. "I like the underwear. Really, I like... I mean, I was just, um..." She was trying to get a hold of the words. "I liked feeling the coolness of the underwear in my hand just sort of tickling me and I just kind of got excited. I mean... I've never been this shy, like there."</p> <p>"I should do something," I offered, but she looked embarrassed so I just said, "Nah. I'd get my pants back on and help clean up your mess, but I'm not sure. I know I have a lot of work to do right now and I'm also not sure what exactly I want to do now. Right now I want to just start again with your panties and go home and finish getting this place more thoroughly cleaned up and do an incredible job of it, but then I want to go home and go to sleep."</p> <p>"That's not fair. I never knew you were into girls, I mean, I was just kind of surprised."</p> <p>"Just enjoy yourself." I said. "Let's go talk more, okay? I'm not going anywhere."</p> <p>She smiled, and then stood up to walk out the door with her hands on her hips.
