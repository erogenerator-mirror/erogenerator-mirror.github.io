He said, his voice dripping with sarcasm, but also as his eyes fell upon her bare legs, the thin spaghetti straps of her dress barely covering her breasts.</p> <p>"I don't think so." She said, feeling the cool night air wash over her skin even though they were still warm, a touch of ice warming the hair on her head.</p> <p>"You're just like me, right?" He asked, his voice so soft that she almost had trouble breathing through her mouth. She stared at him, then reached down and slipped the straps off of her shoulders. "This is what I want..." She said.</p> <p>He stepped forward and let her slip her dress down over her arms, tossing it onto the edge of the tub. She stood there, letting her large breasts slide free of the thin strap of her bra. When they met the water, her nipples stood straight out and she shivered slightly as the cold water touched her breasts. He stepped forward and reached around her slender waist, lifting her off the tub and carrying her towards the bedroom. They entered the small room and he walked her into the bathroom and turned on the shower.</p> <p>"You won't need this shower," He said, and then bent and picked up a towel off of a stand. He folded it and then bent over to dry her, holding onto her as they rubbed their bodies together. He wrapped the towel around her, and then walked her over to the side of the Jacuzzi, where he sat her down on the edge of the tub as he dried her hair. She felt the room heat up but was thankful it wasn't quite as cool as the warm spray as the water washed over her body.</p> <p>Then both of them were toweling each other off. It was hard to do when you're dressed in a man's clothes, but it was the only way to take care of what was on your mind. He gently pulled her robe off and tossed it toward the bed. "Let's have a quick shower," he said.</p> <p>Then she grabbed the shower wand and gently, slowly climbed out of the tub and stepped out too. He closed the shower door, not bothering to keep it opened, and stepped behind her, his hands sliding up her body again as he cupped her breasts, his face to her lower back. She reached behind and closed his shirt, pulling him against her, feeling his hardness as it pressed tightly between her and the shower wall. She wrapped her arms around his waist, resting her head on his shoulder, feeling his chest against her back as he leaned down to kiss her neck. His hands slid down her body, taking hold of her panties and pulling them down over her thighs as he wrapped hers around each of his hands, holding as if it were the most natural thing in the world.</p> <p>He let the water run over their bodies as they stood there, facing each other, the water pouring over them. He turned her around so their bodies were inches apart, so their skin was pressed together. He bent and kissed her, tasting his own saliva which had a slightly sour flavor that tasted vaguely of cologne. His tongue slid into her mouth and she wrapped her arms around his head, pressing her soft lips against his. He pulled back, holding her against him.</p> <p>"Will you fuck me?" He whispered against her lips.</p> <p>"What?" She asked, her eyes wide with amazement. His hard cock was pressing against her thigh before he took his tongue from her mouth.</p> <p>"Will you fuck me? My body is getting sore and I've been horny all week and now all I think about is you." His hands slid up and down her wet, hot skin, cupping the cheeks of her round ass. "You'll have to wait until we part ways if that's okay."</p> <p>She smiled softly. "I love you." She said. "But it's a little cold."</p> <p>He leaned into her body, his cock sliding between her thighs as he kissed her again, his hands sliding under her so his fingers could run over her clit. "This is very cold." He said, his voice a bit raspy. He lowered her hands back to his chest, gripping his forearms as she leaned over and kissed his neck. Her hands slid between her legs, touching his cock as it slid up against her leg as it pressed into her pussy.</p> <p>He stopped kissing her and raised up her body. "Let it cool, maybe you can feel how you really need to go." She reached down between her legs and grabbed the front of his briefs, pulling them down and allowing him to slide out of the water. His cock, semi-erect, brushed against her pussy as it slid down. It was so hard, so thick that she didn't want it to slip inside her, but she just felt so aroused to feel him pressingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
