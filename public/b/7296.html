Now you have the perfect dessert and dessert," as she walked into the bedroom to bring the wine glass to me from her night bag, "and I think dessert is in order. You need this."</p> <p>"Oh."</p> <p>"I'm feeling so sexy now," she said as she handed me the white wine glass.</p> <p>"How did you know?"</p> <p>"It is a good start."</p> <p>"Is this what it's like for you?" I laughed to myself, she had such an amazing attitude towards myself in a romantic way." I was really getting into it, I didn't even know what it was like anymore.</p> <p>She got onto the bed and looked me in the eyes, "So now I make the love making," she stated as she reached up and pulled back the front of my shirt.</p> <p>She looked around the room for a moment and reached for the wine glass. "Do you like it?"</p> <p>"I love it,"</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>* * *</p> <p>That night the conversation turned to sex. I wasn't even there when she had me lie down.</p> <p>"How was your day?"</p> <p>"It was okay, but I have to admit I didn't have it as a surprise," I answered.</p> <p>"I am sorry, I didn't mean..."</p> <p>"No. That's alright."</p> <p>There was a silence and some uncomfortable silence in the room. Then, "Have you had sex yet?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"No, I didn't think so." I felt my head start to fill up with blood, "We can finish the story, if you want."</p> <p>I felt better than I had had all day but I was still scared. I had never had sex and I thought I was afraid to try.</p> <p>"So tell me the story of how you were able to get a girl to want you because you were the perfect height?"</p> <p>"It was not about height," I said.</p> <p>"That is so pathetic. I think that every other woman in the world could have been a nice girl you would be."</p> <p>"You just couldn't see how great some women would be and wouldn't be as good, huh," I added, "I got good reviews for this movie but, to tell the truth, I really have not been able to see a bad movie, even the one that is about a woman and a man."</p> <p>"I know, it's the right movie."</p> <p>"How will I know if any are bad?"</p> <p>"Well, that will depend how bad I get. I've never tried another film with sex,"</p> <p>"You haven't. Did you like it?"</p> <p>"I guess, I'm sure. It was good, but, well, it is a little different."</p> <p>She took the wine glass back and raised it to her lips. She placed her lips on the bottom of the glass and slowly moved the liquor around.</p> <p>"This is good, very good."</p> <p>"I know." I didn't want it to be anything like that at all.</p> <p>She was drinking another drink and looking at me closely. I had no idea how it was possible for her to be so damn beautiful.</p> <p>She looked down at the white wine and raised her head before lowering it down her hand that was in her lap.</p> <p>"Your not that attractive, are you?"</p> <p>"Are you sure you don't want to go out? I don't see why you have to be so self conscious with me."</p> <p>"No. That would be more than fine." She looked up at me. "So how did it start?"</p> <p>"She has this thing about guys being gay or bi-sexual."</p> <p>"I see. The first time she was with me?"</p> <p>"The first time we ever got together. You know, I don't get that feeling you have,"</p> <p>She took another drink and reached out her hand to me, "Would you like to continue this?"</p> <p>It didn't take long until she had her hand in mine, then I leaned forward. Our lips touched. Our lips parted and she kissed me long and deep. It was something completely new for both of us and I felt my body respond strongly to her.
