She asked. "Is it somebody from home?"</p> <p>"Yeah, it was a while ago," I said. "I had a shower today, and I was thinking maybe we could invite you to dinner once we got some fresh air."</p> <p>"Oh really?" She replied. "You're so handsome and charming!"</p> <p>"Well, the dinner is in a restaurant at 8. It's a long drive and we don't talk much," I said pointing to her. "We'll go grab something to eat, and then we'll go," I added. "I'm not sure how to start the day."</p> <p>"Alright then!" She said, laughing along with me. Then added, "It's just in my head that something's coming. A couple of things are always going to come to mind in a hurry. So what do you think?"</p> <p>"I agree. So many great ideas, but what was it you had, and what were those?" I questioned.</p> <p>Then while we were grabbing things to eat, and getting ready to go. She told me about the first time she had invited her to a date with a friend of her mom's. It was a fun time.</p> <p>My head went off. That was a few months ago and I didn't know how to react to her invite. I was still looking out the window trying to understand what happened. I didn't want to think that she didn't have the same feeling as me. It was probably more of the same. I know that that would turn me on when we were dancing and talking during a slow dance together, but in all actuality, it was more like a sisterly thing. I didn't want to be the one to initiate the sexual contact. Instead of making things more intense we just kind of took what we felt and played along.</p> <p>It was a Friday, and the guys and I had a game of bridge with some buddies. As was usual, we made small talk. As I looked out the window I saw that everyone is pretty much on the football team, and I made sure not to get an opportunity to be a distraction. After a couple of glasses of wine, and some music on my stereo, we got more comfortable and danced even more. I was watching her body move beautifully as the guys and I watched her dance. It was a very sensual dance. You could see how her breasts moved with me as she moved and swayed her body, and we would kiss, touch, and rub all over each other. We ended the game with a kiss and a feel before she sat down next to me.</p> <p>My hand slid under her dress and I put my hand underneath her dress. Feeling her warm skin, I ran my fingers all around her bare back. She pushed up against me and we kissed a lot, while I felt her body. Her skin was very soft, and her body was very hot. I didn't need to take off my shirt as I felt a nipple rub up against my chest. As we kissed I looked over at the guys and saw that they had been watching us closely. I then turned to the crowd of women watching us dance. I pulled her in close to me and rubbed my hand all down her side, letting it come to rest on her hip. Feeling her hip, it was warm, and I let my hand slide further and further up. I gently took her chin and turned her head towards mine and kissed her lightly. She didn't say anything, and didn't push me away, but she didn't pull away either. I felt her hands run all over my back. They felt so warm, and I could tell that she was turned on by the way I was touching her.</p> <p>She then pushed me away, leaned in close to me, and whispered into my ear, "Let's go to the club."</p> <p>"Yeah. Why don't you stop by later," I said. "It's been pretty hot."</p> <p>"Oh, that sounds nice," she said as she got up, and walked by me with her head resting on my shoulder. I pulled her close and looked down at her body once again. She was so beautiful. I had never seen a more beautiful woman. I had to say that I hadn't seen a more beautiful woman for my whole life. My girlfriend was beautiful too. And it was so hot in our relationship to want to be with her.</p> <p>As I watched her walk away, I suddenly felt a stirring in my pants. She had a nice slim body, and she was really hot. She hadn't been wearing a bra and her breasts were jiggling as she walked. I wondered if she had a big one! They might be great looking. As my mind was starting to think, I knew that the night wouldn't be over.
