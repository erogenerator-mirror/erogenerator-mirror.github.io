Her lips were against my neck and when I thought her head was about to touch my chest, she gently pulled back and leaned up for a kiss. We kissed passionately while running our hands over each other and I began to massage the roundness of her ass cheeks. The heat of my hand through the thin material of her skirt was amazing, so soft and warm. I wondered if she would have a heart attack if we hadn't stopped our slow lovemaking.</p> <p>Her kiss was sweet, but there was no urgency, just a soft tenderness. Her body was soft and sweet to me, so I wondered if the same could be said for Sarah. She slid off the chair and knelt at my feet. She pulled my shoes off with her fingers and began to kiss my legs lightly. Her tongue slid up the leg of my shorts and I felt the wetness on my skin as she got closer and closer to my cock.</p> <p>I don't know for how long we were kissing, but my eyes were closed and my body was ready for the next act. When I felt her open my shorts to the top of my thighs, I felt her tongue on the underside of my cock but this wasn't enough to send me over the edge.</p> <p>I felt her warm lips around the head of my cock and she worked slowly down the side until her tongue felt the soft ridge. She looked at me, smiled and blew on my cock. I felt the hot breath and she leaned into my body until she had my entire cock in her mouth. She worked her tongue and lips along my length while cupping my balls in her hand. Her thumb brushed against my hard sack and I could feel the hot breath from inside my head.</p> <p>She slowly backed off, pulled my shorts back up over a little bit and then stood up. I wasn't sure if she was serious, but I'm sure she was. She stepped up to me, but instead of putting her hands on my ass, she slid her legs across mine, giving the most wonderful feeling as her feet rubbed against mine. My erection was growing at the feel of her tight body against me.</p> <p>When we kissed again, I felt the heat of Sarah's legs again as she moved towards my head. She took another condom and the package and placed it on my lips. I sucked on it as she slipped my shorts and boxers down. She pulled the boxers back on and I felt my cock press against the cloth of her skirt. I reached up to gently caress her bare breasts, but she pushed my hands away firmly. Her mouth never left mine. Her breasts were warm and full, the tips of her nipples erect.</p> <p>My mouth covered the nipple of her right breast and I felt a slight pull on her nipple and then small movement as she released and then repeated her move on my left breast. I used all of my skills of sucking on her breasts to pull her body towards mine. She took my hand from her breast to slide under the back of her skirt. Her panties weren't as tight as Sarah's felt and I felt the hard outline of the lips of her pussy pressing into my fingers and her wetness.</p> <p>When she slid my fingers down her wet lips to her opening, she moved them slowly away and my fingers entered her. Her eyes opened wide when I touched her, but she continued to kiss me deeply. She began to push me over onto my back with her leg. She straddled me with her head between my breasts and leaned over me so I could feel the warmth of her breasts on my chest. Her legs were still above mine so she could rub her body all over mine.</p> <p>I felt her pussy against mine and her breathing on my chest. She moved her hips, pushing her pussy against me, but she pulled her lips away so one of her hands was holding firmly on my cock. She began to move her body back and forth, sliding her pussy along me with each down stroke. I pushed my hips up, trying to drive my cock deeper into her. She held onto my chest, pulling my hardness in her as she moved. I was trying not to hurt her but my attempts weren't helping much. I kept pushing my hardness into her wetness until I felt my balls tighten again. I felt her legs tremble against mine and her orgasm built up in her body until it crashed against my shaft.</p> <p>I felt the wave of release building inside my balls and then it ripped through me as my cock spurted my hot cum into the condom. I couldn't think anymore because I was already spent. I felt her pussy grip my cock as the contractions of the orgasm tore through her body.</p> <p>She let go of my chest as the waves of our bodies slowly faded away. I leaned over her and kissed her forehead. I felt her breathing, but it was notâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
