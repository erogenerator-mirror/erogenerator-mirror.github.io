"I can't hold down...more...more..." Her voice trailed off. It was getting more urgent. Her hips were humping against the air. She was close. "Oh, God...oh, God..."</p> <p>The world blurred as my body took over. I was lost in my own pleasure. It was nothing more than a haze of pleasure as I watched her breasts shake with every move. Her eyes closed as I pushed my hand back to rub herself over her clit. "Ah...fuck...that's great...now fill me up..." She panted "fuck me baby...right now...ohh god...now..."</p> <p>The last I noticed was her legs clapping together and the world going dark. Just before my eyes fell back to normal, I opened my eyes to see her lying naked on top of me, looking so beautiful. My hands covered up her breasts and my mouth was open as I tried to breath.</p> <p>"Wow," she said, looking at me "that was amazing." I smiled at her and kissed her shoulder, the hollow at the top which just seemed so delicate. I could get used to doing that right away. She giggled, "Mmm" then leaned back.</p> <p>"This is so cool."</p> <p>"I agree."</p> <p>We lay kissing and caressing each other for a while until I broke away. She smiled. "Let's do a bit in your bed," she said, and she stood up. She handed me the blanket and climbed onto my bed. We lay there a little longer, each of us smiling and touching. The warm sun was getting warm but I couldn't get into it. She kissed me again, her hand running down my spine. "Wow."</p> <p>"Yeah," I said, "that was so incredible, but we can't do something for a bit."</p> <p>We were not done at all. I had turned on my side and she was pulling at my shorts. They were still around my knee, so she slid them down. I raised my knee to help, which she seemed to approve. Then we were side by side. She took my cock in her hand and stroked it, which made the head stand up. "How big?" she looked up at me.</p> <p>"Eight inches if it's not too big."</p> <p>"It is, and you're so big. Big as a truck or something." She grinned. "How big?"</p> <p>"About eight inches. How about you? That's about two feet long."</p> <p>"It's not too fat is it?" she asked.</p> <p>"No." I assured her. I reached down, trying to get it into my shorts, but it was just barely inside. "No, no, no."</p> <p>"Yes" she replied, "I want it." She began to stroke me faster and I felt her other hand on my stomach, just under my balls. I couldn't tell if I was hard or limp. I reached up and touched her breast. She squeezed it while her legs encircled me. She let go and I felt her arm slide back. As I looked, I saw a very dark brown eye, and that was her finger. She held it straight up. And my cock went back to soft as it hardened and throbbed against my leg.</p> <p>"God its beautiful," she said.</p> <p>She put her finger to her lips, and she sucked her breath in. "I think I might want it back."</p> <p>"I'd like another taste," she said, and she stroked me up and down, sliding her finger down the underside. After a while, I couldn't take much more and I started pushing my hips towards her finger. She pushed and worked until I felt it and then she lifted her finger but didn't come back until I was again.</p> <p>"Is that good baby?" she asked. "That feels really good."</p> <p>"Yeah, it's good too." I leaned forward and rested my shoulder against my chest. We were almost on top of each other. I didn't think I had ever been this close to any woman before. I just kept going. She put her finger over her lips and I felt it slide into my mouth as if she was touching me there. Then she pushed it into me.</p> <p>"Mmm...that is so warm...I can feel your fingers inside me."</p> <p>"I've got something extra for you."</p> <p>She lay on top of me and put her right leg over the arm of the chair and got up. I felt my shorts slide up my thighs, and as she got on the floor next to me, I felt her soft breasts brushing against my stomach as she took off me. As she did, she turned the chair around and sat down on it, facing me.</p> <p>"Mmm," she said asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
