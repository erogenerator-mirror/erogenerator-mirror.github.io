I want to feel that first orgasm." I had to do it. I had to. My hands were trembling and my heart was pounding.</p> <p>When the big orgasm was finally subsiding I pushed my shorts on and pulled a towel up. I didn't really believe we were done. Just a little left, now I was covered up but not before I kissed her to let her know that I had been a naughty little girl and liked being the one who had teased. As I did that my mind was totally lost in a sea of lust. All I wanted more than anything was to let her be with me again with her hands on my breasts.</p> <p>When we got back to our room, I turned down all the lights and sat down. She crawled up until she was lying on the end of the bed. She reached between her legs and guided me into her pussy and I went in for the final ride. When she orgasmed I was still sitting there watching her body shake and quiver as the last waves crashed over her. I think she was afraid that she wouldn't be able to move or come down. But as I started to move I could almost see how she loved it when it was my first time.</p> <p>When we had recovered it was time for me to tell her about the surprise.</p> <p>"I know that what happened isn't totally out of the ordinary or even a surprise. In fact, I really enjoyed it. I had so many orgasms with you, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. But today I want to experience the same passion that you were yesterday. You know what I was like a little while, when I was in the bathtub, when it was just you and me in the tub. There was nothing like that in heaven." She grinned and moved over me and straddled me. I could see her pussy getting wetter and wetter.</p> <p>"Before I let you fuck me today I had to tell you something. I didn't want to do it. Today I wanted to fuck you again. You don't have to tell me what to do. You can just stay and let the anticipation build." She was now sitting on my dick and moving up and down. "It's just a matter of time."</p> <p>Before I had a chance to protest (and I thought I would) she moved up next to me and put her head on my shoulder. "Let's get you on your back and I'll kiss and lick you until you come back to me. We'll do that every day!"</p> <p>When she had ridden me for about 10 minutes I was feeling pretty good and starting to feel that pressure build in my balls. I could feel the way she had worked her pussy muscles with my hands, telling me to try for longer strokes, make her come harder. I was almost there. When I didn't take my hand away I felt her nipples harden. She had already told me to get a hold of them. When she rolled on top of me I felt her body go rigid. For the first time I wanted to watch her climax.</p> <p>That would be fun. I had to try for a minute. I could feel her pussy lips sliding around the sides. She was moaning, trying to get as much contact with me as she could, but I was just too far gone. I had lost my mind.</p> <p>When it finally subsided I started to really enjoy every delicious moment while I held her and caressed her nipples. It took forever because I could only hold her so a good part of her was moving with me. Then I was just lying there, letting her get her breath back.</p> <p>"So how did it feel to have you come up here again?" I finally managed to say.</p> <p>"The same as yesterday. That was a dream come true, you know. It was the greatest experience I have ever had. As good as it felt." A little breathlessly, she added, "I can hardly wait till another time."</p> <p>She had just rolled off of me then. Now she straddled me and started to caress my cock. I'm sure it was hard to tell between our height, but I think it started down to an inch or so. She was still rubbing my pole. "I was thinking that it would be so much nicer if you could make love to me instead. I wouldn't feel too guilty, would I?"</p> <p>"No not guilty. I don't think I would feel guilty if you had. It would be a lot better for you."</p> <p>"I guess I wouldn't feel guilty about it either." She was smiling.</p> <p>"Let's go to the shower and get cleaned up. We'll talk some more about our relationship later."
