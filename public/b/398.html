I grinned, knowing it was no use, that I had the power to do it myself.</p> <p>"Do you want this?" She asked.</p> <p>"Yes. Let's see, let's see." I was still stroking her clit. "If you do it, we need to get out of here."</p> <p>"Can we get to the next table?" My mother asked.</p> <p>"Let's see."</p> <p>We both came down to the tables where my father told us we should find someplace to eat. Mom went to her room, and I cleaned up the dishes as best I could then went to wait for my mother. She came out very late to see me, and when she did come out she was wearing a short night gown.</p> <p>"Sorry, I didn't have any clothes on just then." She apologized. "I thought you weren't going to be back for a long time, and you should have come back."</p> <p>"No, not tonight, and I hope you can forgive me. I have so much to do." I kissed her on the cheek then, "So it's going to be tomorrow at 3:30?"</p> <p>"Absolutely." She replied.</p> <p>We set out to enjoy lunch. My mother asked if Dad was around. He said he was. I got us some appetizers that Dad had left on the patio. We made small talk as we ate.</p> <p>It was about 3:30 when I saw my father enter the room. He looked like he was on the treadmill with his back to me, probably working out for two hours every day. He stopped and sat down to take a drink of scotch. He watched my mother and I as we worked over our lunch.</p> <p>Our plates were empty so I asked him, "Do you want a drink?"</p> <p>"No, we don't have any liquor here. Let me see what we have." My father replied.</p> <p>"There is a pitcher of water on the counter by the chair." I said.</p> <p>My father brought over two glasses, poured himself a glass, filled a pitcher with water, handed it to my mother, and he started to pour himself a glass. I got up, took the glass, and set the pitcher down. I turned to my father and handed him his glass, I did the same to my mother. Then I said, "I am back, I need to go to the shower."</p> <p>"You want to stay?" He asked.</p> <p>"What if Mom wants to stay?" I asked. "We don't have to. You can use the shower if you want." I added. He laughed at that and the two of them went up off the counter.</p> <p>I had to go to the sink so I started to wash the remains of the meal. When I was finished I washed away the remnants of the dinner and looked to my mother to see if I could get my mother to go shower with me. She agreed, and when I handed her my keys, she accepted them. I went upstairs, into the bedroom, where I heard the shower, so I headed down to my own shower.</p> <p>A few minutes later the shower curtain opened, and my mother had her arms around my neck. She looked over at me and kissed me, and I saw Dad sitting there watching her, smiling, as I pulled my mother tighter to me. Dad was still rubbing himself against her, and his hands were down her front moving under her robe.</p> <p>"Didn't Mommy get yours?" My father asked.</p> <p>"Yes daddy, she had it put on me when I was a baby." I told him.</p> <p>My father laughed, then took my mother's hand. "Come up stairs and let me see what you were doing." He said.</p> <p>My mother led him up the stairs, and as they got to the bedroom my father was busy with my mother's robe. He stopped when we got in the bedroom, then started rubbing her back. He then bent his head, moved his face back and began kissing her neck.</p> <p>"Are you sure you're not done with me?" He asked her.</p> <p>"Oh yes, of course I am." She replied.</p> <p>Dad had been kissing up and down her back, and she began to squirm. He lifted his head up, looked her directly in the eyes again, then kissed her.</p> <p>"I'm hungry." My father said.</p> <p>"I like that, but we need to find something to eat, and I'm starving." She said.</p> <p>"Ok. Let's go get something to drink." My father said. He picked up my mother's robe off the dresser.</p> <p>Dad and Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
