After a few more seconds, I pulled back, and pulled her to me again, giving her a quick kiss. Then I lowered myself onto the bench with her, and pressed into her again. I moved into her harder, pushing against the hard bench I used as a table as my thrusts were harder for her.</p> <p>With each thrust, I slid a little farther on the bench and pushed into her harder. I felt her breasts press into me, and the top of her blouse brushed against my hand. I reached out to cup her left breast at that point, and squeezed tightly as we each drove ourselves toward an orgasm.</p> <p>With my hand on her breast, I cupped it fully in the palm of my hand, and began caressing her nipple with the tips of my fingers. This time I could sense the change in her breathing, as it became more labored.</p> <p>As her legs trembles, I could feel her muscles clenching. I know what it feels like for her, but that is exactly the opposite of what I felt for her. As her muscles started to squeeze, her body became still, a smile on her face.</p> <p>A few seconds later, she started to move against me as well. When she moved away from the bench, I moved onto the bench, pulling her down onto it to me more. She began to pull her blouse free, and as I lifted my head for a breath, she removed mine, and unbuttoned my blouse.</p> <p>Her hands were still on my breasts, and I pushed my hands into her face. Before she could take a breath in anyway, I stopped her.</p> <p>She started again, this time pressing into me tightly. I felt her nipples press against my bra, and knew she still had one against her jeans. She pressed into me even more, as I pulled her pants off. I was now left with only my bra and panties, with which I couldn't even reach down.</p> <p>All I could do was hold her close, and hold her. Even as my body wanted to pull her back into the bench and ride her hard, I could feel my hips pushing against hers and my breasts in her hands.</p> <p>She started to cry, and lifted herself off the bench with her own force.</p> <p>"I love you, Katie," she said, kissing me. Then she slid down the bench on her back to kiss me. "I love you, baby," she whispered with her head near my ear.</p> <p>"I love you too, Katie." I was still clinging onto her to keep her from rolling over, so she pulled her jeans off and stood up. Now she was naked, but for her panties.</p> <p>"I want to taste you," she said, and moved toward me. "I want to lick you." I could feel every fiber in my head getting wet at that prospect. She put her bra on, and stepped into the chair, letting me take of my top and bra, as she got the chair ready to settle into.</p> <p>I sat down for a moment, and she stood over me, holding my face there. Once she had positioned her face well, her fingers went to the back on the zipper of my jeans. With one quick pull, she had them open. My breathing was coming faster now. I tried to look at her, but my vision was limited. I could only just make out the shape of her mouth moving over my breast.</p> <p>A moment later, her tongue was licking up the bottom of my breast. I had moved myself back toward my chair, so she could get on to it without losing contact with me. As I lifted my head to see, she was still kissing me, with her breasts against my mouth. I felt a bit of trepidation as she moved her hands in on top of mine in helping me to hold her breasts up while we continued to kiss.</p> <p>Then she moved herself off of me and onto the bench. As soon as I was in place, she began kissing my neck, my collarbone, and my breasts. She kissed and licked all around them with her lips, and her tongue was licking them like crazy.</p> <p>"Don't stop!" I told her, and pushed her back onto the bench. I leaned forward, and kissed her mouth again. Our lips barely met.</p> <p>It was only a few seconds before she pulled away and turned around until she was in front of me. "I want you to touch me," she said. I took no more time, and slipped my arms around her in support while reaching down to fondle her legs.</p> <p>The hands of my hands touched the inside of her thighs, and the soft skin on her feet ran over them and touched the backs of them. Moving my hand up her thighs, to her belly button, I found my fingers touching the top of her sexâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
