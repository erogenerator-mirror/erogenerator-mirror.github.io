"I wasn't going to let you up. I guess it's time I got some sleep."</p> <p>I looked down at my hands and could see my nails. My nails were dark brown, and my fingers were straight as a stick. They were the longest I had ever seen. It was the first thing I have ever had at this point, so I wasn't concerned about it. He looked down at me, his eyes taking in my appearance.</p> <p>"Do you think you're going to stop crying when you go home?"</p> <p>"I guess not," I said, looking at him suspiciously.</p> <p>"Can you get me some clothes?" he asked.</p> <p>I looked around the room. He seemed to think too much of my clothing. I knew it probably wouldn't have mattered since there were plenty of my clothes at the hotel, but I could still feel his gaze. I sighed in relief as he opened the door and led me to his big bathroom. There, he locked me in the shower, taking a cold shower. After I was finally done, we got dressed and headed out, heading back to my room.</p> <p>"Where're we going now babe?" I asked.</p> <p>He smiled. "Just to get my clothes. We're going on the boat."</p> <p>"Can you cook?"</p> <p>"Yes. I was thinking that I would cook for myself. I wouldn't want to have to work long before I could make enough of a meal and get some sleep if I didn't need one by myself." He said to me.</p> <p>I thought for a minute and then nodded. He looked back at me.</p> <p>"Okay. Let's go to town babe."</p> <p>With that, he stepped out of the apartment in the snow. I smiled and followed, taking the walk to the town where he purchased some food and some cold cuts. He bought a few bottles of chilled wine that he and one of his friends brought to town for a special night that they were visiting. That evening, we sat down at the bar at the dinner table. We talked with a good amount of laughter and, even though it was cold, our conversation was still warm and relaxing. When we got to the main table, we both began to feel drunk.</p> <p>"Do you do this every year?" he said, laughing.</p> <p>I laughed too. "Yep. I'm a stripper. My stage name is 'Sneak'."</p> <p>I was laughing with him, feeling drunk before my eyes, but the feeling that I had was gone by this time. "Sneak?"</p> <p>He laughed. "No. I'm a bit of an ass sometimes. I'll even let you suck me. I had to come up with a name for a couple of the local clubbers, and one person told me to 'suck him for a day'," he said with a grin. "And since tonight's the night, I'll share. 'Sneak" is a dirty workman's name."</p> <p>I couldn't believe I was actually talking to him. My throat started to make a couple of tiny coughs that seemed to embarrass me a little. He laughed even harder, leaning in closer. "Do you like it?" he asked with excitement.</p> <p>"I love it." I said to him with an exasperated voice.</p> <p>He put an arm over mine and looked at his hand in my eyes for a long moment, which seemed like it had stopped breathing before his hand had stopped to find it again. There, on top of the warm drinks and wine, was a deep look, but mostly was something more...serious on his face where all he was smiling, though there was some humor in his eyes.</p> <p>"Do you have much of anyone left by the way?" he asked.</p> <p>This made me smile. He asked me that. My eyes flickered when I looked down at something. It wasn't as if I didn't have anything to say. In fact, the topic was something that I just wasn't quite ready to talk about to anyone. I looked up at him. He had a big smile on his face. I couldn't tell if it was an expression of shock or of joy or if it was anger and happiness. Either way, I was sure that he had this on his mind. I looked back down again, only to feel it, his hand, a couple more hands, more fingers, even as it was only half my hand, and then a kiss. It was warm, tender and passionate. It was something that I had been struggling to come to terms about a long time before, but was quickly moving away from me. When we had kissed, Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
