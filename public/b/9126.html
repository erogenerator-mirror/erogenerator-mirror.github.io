I have no secrets. It's just not right."</p> <p>I looked down at the empty bottle that was between us.</p> <p>"So...do you want to go to town with me? I mean, you do seem a little nervous. I mean, well...do you? And what about you? I mean, what about your husband? I mean, he has to be in bed right now, you know? Do you want me to make love to him?"</p> <p>Auntie Jane took a swig of her drink and let the alcohol take the sting out of it.</p> <p>"I guess I kinda like your idea," she said, looking down at her lap and putting her hand over the top of hers. "I mean, we're going to be here for at least an hour, and when we get home, I want to go to your room, put on something pretty, and be by myself. That's just what I want."</p> <p>"No. No, really, that's not what I meant."</p> <p>"Oh. OK," Aunt Jane said, taking another sip of her drink. She looked up at me with that look in her eyes, as if she was waiting for something, but wasn't sure what.</p> <p>"So...I need you to be my lover, right?" she said, moving closer to me and pulling the robe over me. "Do you want to be my lover?"</p> <p>My heart started to beat faster and blood started rushing southward.</p> <p>"N-no."</p> <p>"Well, if you want to be my lover, you'd better do it, because now that I've done it...I mean, if you're going to get me naked..."</p> <p>I was shocked. Not just because she had stripped me, but also because I'd just seen my Aunt naked a few months back.</p> <p>"That is, if you want me to do it," Aunt Jane said, putting on the robe and heading back to the front of the hotel.</p> <p>"No. No, it's alright. It's not like that. I just don't want your clothes anywhere near me."</p> <p>"But...you're right. I should, I mean, I don't know if I should..."</p> <p>"You can't!" Aunt Jane said, leaning over to me as she pulled away the robe from my shoulders and dropping it onto the sofa.</p> <p>"But I want you to."</p> <p>Aunt Jane reached her arms back around me and pulled herself close against me.</p> <p>"But, like, we can't, I mean..."</p> <p>"No, we can't do this, you had to hear some of my stuff when we were in the shower, so we have time," she said, reaching back beneath the robe and sliding her hand down my stomach.</p> <p>I watched Aunt Jane's face as she slowly traced a hand down my body, feeling the warmth of my skin underneath the robe.</p> <p>"Your body is so beautiful, you're so soft and...you know...you smell very nice," Aunt Jane said, running her hand over my face. "Would you like to feel me?"</p> <p>"What...what would you do?" I asked in a stunned voice. "I mean, you're my Aunt..."</p> <p>"That's right," she said, running a hand through my hair and pulling my head back to see my face. "And I want you to feel what I do to you."</p> <p>She leaned forward to kiss me, rubbing her chest against mine, her soft breasts feeling wonderfully plump against my belly. Our kiss was a quick one, just a soft one.</p> <p>"So, you want me to make love to you?" she said softly. Her question startled me.</p> <p>"I...uhm," I stammered, unsure of what to say. "I would love you to make love to me," I found myself saying out loud, unable to talk.</p> <p>"I know that," she said, leaning in close to my ear to whisper to me. "I understand."</p> <p>She stood up and put her arms around me and pulled me against her. I was stunned. Never before had I felt that way with anything. It made me feel as if something was just missing in the whole experience of kissing another grown man.</p> <p>"Oh God! Oh God, you're...you're going to make love to me?" I said, my mouth going dry. I'd never felt like this before.</p> <p>"That's what I wanted to talk about with you, silly. That's what I want to tell you," she responded. "But, you have to admit, before we're going, you're kind of in the middle of it, aren't you, little brother?"</p> <p>"Uh, yeah...yeah," I said, wonderingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
