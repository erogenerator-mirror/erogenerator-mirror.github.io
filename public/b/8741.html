He didn't think she would be.</p> <p>'I suppose that's not much to ask of a mate. Especially one as young as you,' she said, almost as if giving him the air-brush. 'I've got to admit it's different for us young wolves.'</p> <p>'We're not always the most honest, if you must know,' he said.</p> <p>'What's different between us, is where we really are,' she said, smiling. 'I'm sure you're well aware that we look alike.'</p> <p>'Yes, but that's only our species,' he said. 'We're much more honest in saying our bodies are different. There's a difference. We can't always be the sort of people I'd like to spend time with, but we can say goodbye. Sometimes things just aren't always good.'</p> <p>'We're different, no?' he smiled. 'What would work best for you? That's just the way it is, isn't it?'</p> <p>'I suppose I might be, but not just for you. Sometimes I just want to get the man's attention.'</p> <p>'That's not the same as what the others do, is it,?' he said. 'I don't want to get any younger just for the sex-fags. It's for me more than it is for you. And, as we've said, what happens if there's another person just between you two?'</p> <p>'What is it with mates?' she frowned, putting a hand on her hip. 'I'm not a member of your pack. We'll never do anything with each other.'</p> <p>'Why not?' he asked. 'We've got the same people and are good mates. Besides, we're not out to kill each other. We're mates, right?' he said. 'And as mates, we also have a duty to look after those of other packs.'</p> <p>'If the packs are not there, then what?' she smiled at herself in the mirror. 'What kind of mates are we, if that's what is going on?'</p> <p>'There's only one way,' he pointed out. 'The wolves do the same as we do. You'll have to change your appearance, in some ways,' he said, reaching for the top of her head. 'If you want to, then you get naked. We don't have any secrets. And we're not going to talk about what happened between you and the alpha.'</p> <p>*******************</p> <p>'I don't understand it,' she whispered to herself. The sun had risen over the horizon, and she stood in the garden of the house with her feet up on the stairs.</p> <p>'It's a part of life,' the man she trusted to not only keep her secrets, but to live it as her own.</p> <p>Her eyes flickered down and saw, for the first time, her own nakedness. It was a revelation. No longer did she think of the girl in the dress and the clothes, but of a girl half her age.</p> <p>She was young and beautiful -- she could've been a woman, she had been told before, but the feeling was overwhelming. This was her world, and she was the girl in the house, too. She was still a young woman, as beautiful as any of the other wolves she'd looked through the door. And despite her obvious age, she was still the girl in the dress.</p> <p>She shuddered at the thought of her own body and the memories of the girl in her bed.</p> <p>She took an involuntary breath. The man at the top of her stair was still there. Maybe he was still looking out at the backyard, he probably thought that she was still in bed.</p> <p>Perhaps she could still be a girl if she was still in the dress and had dressed. He could still have her to get to her, and then the man and her could start again.</p> <p>And she could get to the wolves. They needed to be dealt with.</p> <p>The thought made her stomach churn. The only good thing was that these thoughts would come to her and they would not be so terrible. Or so terrible they would scare every other wolf in sight.</p> <p>The idea that she might need to change herself was terrifying. She hadn't had the courage to face the outside in several months. She'd never face the outside again.</p> <p>But she'd never find out. She'd never be able to change her appearance. She'd never be able to change her parents name. She'd never be able to change her own appearance.</p> <p>And if she was unable to meet her wolf's desire, she could certainly change her hair.</p> <p>It was a shame that she couldn't have that.</p> <p>She couldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
