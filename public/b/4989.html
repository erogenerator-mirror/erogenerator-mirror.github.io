He was sitting on the edge and when I turned around, he was lying on his back with his left hand gently rubbing his right nipple. It wasn't long before he had a massive erection poking at his belly.</p> <p>"I don't know if I can stand this any more," he said as he turned over on his side and laid there trying to catch his breath. He reached out his hand and rubbed my breast and rolled onto his side and we lay there silently watching the stars as his free hand cupped both of my breasts and squeezed them. I was still lying over him but now his hand had slid down between my legs to find my pussy. I moaned as he rubbed my sensitive pussy lips. We continued making out as I reached between us and spread my legs apart just in front of him. Still sitting on the edge I used my fingers to spread my lips for him. As long as I could hold it I just lowered myself down and pressed myself down in just a couple inches. I couldn't help myself and I groaned as his fingers slid into me. He slid them out of me and then slid them in alongside the fingers of his other hand.</p> <p>When I started to return the favor, he stopped me. "Wait, don't go there," he said firmly. I nodded my head and he rolled over again, pulling me onto him and pulling me down on top of him in the process. I lowered myself down over him and let him rub my pussy up and down, squeezing as I came back down. Now we were both facing the stars, both of us enjoying what was still a very surreal fantasy. I don't know who began to laugh. It was probably just Mike and me but it seemed as if no one had said anything.</p> <p>"Hey, don't worry," he said as he ran his hands up and down my sides. He looked at me like I was something special.</p> <p>"You're special. Thank you." We lay like that for a couple minutes.</p> <p>"Hey, I wasn't in a rush and I don't want to come before you do," he replied, running his hands up and down my sides again.</p> <p>"I like that," I exclaimed.</p> <p>"It's OK. I wanted to make sure that we enjoyed ourselves." I told him.</p> <p>"It was wonderful for me too. I liked sharing a man. I don't know, I liked it a lot but it was also erotic as hell." He said.</p> <p>"It was great, yes," I replied and continued by running my hands up and down his chest. He raised his hips and moved his cock against my pussy.</p> <p>"That's OK with me," I said as my hand slid down and rubbed the head of his cock into my slippery passage. "You won't be big enough, but we'll just take it."</p> <p>The next thing I knew I was riding him reverse cowgirl, sliding up and down on his cock for all I was worth. I could have cum, just from riding him like that but I didn't want to yet. We fucked in this position for a few minutes, each of us savoring our new found pleasure, until he started to moan as the urge to cum mounted.</p> <p>"We've got to cum," he said quickly as he reached down to move me off of his cock. Not having a condom on, I couldn't really get close to his cock. I had to wait until he grabbed my hips and directed me down onto him. I took him in, squeezing my internal muscles as he began thrusting up into me. As his cock went in deeper and deeper, the feeling of being completely filled made me almost come again. As he felt me starting to come, he pulled me off of him.</p> <p>"I want to taste it," I said. He was on his knees in a millisecond, reaching down to grasp my ass in both hands. He brought me down so that I was lying on my back once again. I was on all fours on the bed. As he moved into me I could feel the head of his cock hitting the end end of my pussy. My body was moving up and down trying to find a rhythm but I couldn't do that. Not only was it just what I wanted, it was still a long time since I'd had a cock.</p> <p>"Here," he said. I sat up and he took a condom. He rolled one on his cock and began to push his hard cock into my pussy. When I didn't move his cock down, he pushed and the head disappeared into me. I was able to take it in with little discomfort at all. Once he was fully into me he grabbed my hips and began to move his cock in a smallâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
