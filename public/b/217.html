She wasn't as tall as I was, and her waist was slim, but not skinny. She was kind of thin, but her hips were a little thick, and her breasts actually looked kind of small for her frame, though they were perky and full.</p> <p>I think she was a bit over six feet. I didn't think she weighed more than a hundred pounds, but she was around six foot. She had shoulder-length auburn hair with dark brown eyes, a small chin, with a cute nose. She wasn't as thin as I was, but wasn't as thin as I would have liked, more like a full-figured version. She wasn't as big as I was, but still pretty damn good looking, if you know where I mean.</p> <p>We got into her car, and I followed her to her house. I was feeling a little better now, and was looking forward to our next session, but I kind of had a weird urge to get the hell out of there and go home. I had no job, my dad owned a company, and we had a lot of free time we couldn't spend, especially alone. I didn't have anyone else, and my apartment had really taken me by surprise.</p> <p>I walked up to her and said, "Can I take you home now"?</p> <p>"I'd like that very much, so do I", and she turned around and headed to the door with a big smile on her face. I walked in and followed her and walked her into her apartment.</p> <p>She looked to be in her late fifties, but she made up for it with clothes, and a nice couch. We had a nice dinner and two glasses of wine, talking and getting to know each other better. We got our things set up and had a couple beers, and I thought I was getting comfortable. I told her a little about life in college, what we had planned, and where we lived. She said that she lived in the dorm up the road, but was still a sophomore and could afford to get some college.</p> <p>We talked about a lot of stuff, and I told her I had been at a university in New York for two years, and that I was currently in New Jersey. She said that she had been at a university in St. Louis for six years, and had done some stuff before, but she'd only been to school for the last two years. She said that she was actually an assistant professor of psychology at a university in Atlanta and she was currently studying philosophy. Her favorite professor was Paul Newman, she said, and he was pretty good in that subject.</p> <p>We laughed as I told her about what we had just done down there the other night. She said that there was a real "power" of it, and she didn't feel up to that kind of sex stuff and sex with a bunch of hookers.</p> <p>I went on, and she asked me, "did you do that?"</p> <p>"Yeah, you know I did," I smiled and nodded my head.</p> <p>"You know you can just fuck me, right?" I asked her.</p> <p>She laughed a little, and said, "Of course I do."</p> <p>"I just wonder..." I started. She interrupted me.</p> <p>"Come on," she said, "fuck me, if you don't mind."</p> <p>I started to pull back, but she said, "Wait," and she pulled her panties down around her ankles. "Let me take care of you." She got down on her knees, and she unbuttoned my pants and pulled my cock out. She looked at it, and said, "I want to see if you're man enough to actually fuck me."</p> <p>I looked down, and saw no condom or any other protection. I was pretty sure I knew it wasn't safe, but it was good to know. She looked up at me again, put two fingers on my lips and said, "I really want to suck your cock, and I want you to just cum in my hand. I want to see how big it is." She pulled out a rubber and got the condom on and put it around my cock.</p> <p>She got up on her knees, with her head at my feet, and smiled up at me. I smiled a little, as she gave me a really sweet kiss. We kissed a lot, and she said, "I really want to do it", and she pushed me back on the couch, and then got back up on my knees and I helped her. I put her panties to the side, but she still didn't seem prepared for it. She put her lips on my cock and just rubbed them against it, rubbing it gently with her handâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
