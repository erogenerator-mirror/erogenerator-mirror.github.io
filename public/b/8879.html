"So, we get started, what do we do?" My fingers start inching towards his hardon and I gently massage the area in between.</p> <p>"Well it's like this, we can do this for each other right now. But that's just a beginning, we have many more exciting things to explore and learn together."</p> <p>"You're so much fun..." I let my hands move towards his crotch, "what do we have here?" I rub my palm along his length, "...I wonder how we do it so well together, you have been thinking about this for weeks." I lean into his ear and whisper, "You're all mine, your mine alone." I turn him around and push him down on his back, he looks up at me, and I take his hand and lead him towards a room in the house.</p> <p>I walk us to my bedroom and we start removing each other's clothing.</p> <p>"So, where's the big one?" I ask him.</p> <p>We make our way to the bed and I remove his shirt and tie. My heart is racing. I have his attention as it begins to rise again. And with every movement of his body, the swelling cock is coming closer and closer to me, more and more.</p> <p>He sits up as I pull his shorts down. His cock juts out at me, hard and ready to strike. I look down to see if it's too large, his head grows as he looks at me, it's as hard as a rock, its thickness almost too large. I am a bit scared of him, it's like a snake ready to strike. I am a bit afraid of his teeth.</p> <p>I lean forward to give his dick a gentle suck. Then I slowly go down on his cock, my mouth sliding on him until I have nearly reached his balls. The head of his cock slides into the back of my throat easily. I let it slip further until it hits the back of my throat. I slide my lips over his cock as best I can, as I slowly push myself further up his shaft, feeling him hit the back of my throat.</p> <p>Once he is fully in my mouth, my hand begins to caress his balls, rolling them gently in my hand and my fingers playfully tease his ass. I slide my tongue into his shaft, licking all the way down to his balls, licking over them, nibbling gently on them, tasting his sweet pre-cum. I gently pull back up his cock, sucking only the head. Then, leaning back down again, repeating the same treatment, "suck, harder, don't tease."</p> <p>He grabs my head with his hands and pulls me further onto his dick. He pulls back and my lips close around his head. He strokes my head slowly, loving the feel of it in my mouth. I reach up to his balls and gently run my fingernails over his sack while taking his shaft deep into my throat and slowly taking his shaft into my stomach again.</p> <p>I can't believe I am completely taking him. He has already shown me how he likes the taste of precum when we fuck. He's always telling me that he loves my taste and smell. I am loving him more than I can ever say to anyone. We have fucked just about every part of each other's body, never been a one-way fuck-talk. Now that his dick is fully in my mouth, I am sucking him, my eyes closed so I can take his whole cock with one motion.</p> <p>I feel his hand go to my crotch, his fingers touching my mound, playing it lightly. I push my hips up meeting his hand as my mouth works on his cock. I feel his fingers move to my pussy, caressing the lips, sliding up inside. It is like he is teasing me again and again, I feel his finger slide down to my ass hole and slowly, teasingly finger fucking it. I moan around his cock. Suddenly, he pulls his finger out and I feel coldness touching me, circling. I arch my brow as it presses against my ass. I want to feel him inside me, to feel him in me now.</p> <p>And I want to feel him now. I can almost feel him stretching me open as my hands start to caress my breasts to release even more. I feel his fingers working on my pussy, probing my outer lips, then the coldness of the thing to enter me. I shiver as I feel him slide further up my body, his fingers pressing into my opening, my hands gripping the bed covers as he presses in against me.</p> <p>I want to feel him, as he enters me, "Fuck me, make me yours again." It's not a request, I'm not giving him that request. I tell him I want himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
