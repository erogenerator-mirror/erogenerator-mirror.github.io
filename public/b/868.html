I thought for just a moment. I was about to apologize to Sam, to try and explain, to get him to stop, but in the back of my mind the guilt crept in.</p> <p>"No, I don't want to see him, to see him."</p> <p>"Oh come on..." I thought. Sam had a point.</p> <p>"You said you'd do it."</p> <p>"I told you. I'm not going to."</p> <p>"Why not?" I thought, trying to read my husband's face. It was so hard to read him physically. Just before I lost his heart to the one, he lost hers, too. I couldn't lose hers.</p> <p>"Look, let's see if you can understand why he did it, let's just be done with this," I said. I pulled myself together. I made sure to be as calm as I could.</p> <p>"It happened, it doesn't matter how it happened. You're an adult. You could stop doing this with him." I tried to rationalize. Just for just a moment, to be able to tell him that I was ready to go with the flow? That was the problem. When was the moment in which we could really be together?</p> <p>"Just be done with it, baby. I love you and I'd give anything for you. I'm not going to tell a soul what happened. I don't want to hurt you. I know that's hard, but I won't lose you if I don't do it. " I held his hand, and kissed him. I pulled away from him and said, "Let's get to the boat first." I could feel a little panic rising again.</p> <p>We had a brief discussion about where we should go. Since I was going to take the next approach, I told him that it was not as bad as it sounded. I decided that once we were in my family dock, I just had to take it. As to take the next, it would give me the excuse I needed. If things worked out with the family boat, he wouldn't have to worry about me having to take the boat, and his family would get to see him in a safe state.</p> <p>My mind and body reacted to being at the boat, when we got settled in. The boat was small. The people around were older, and I knew of several men that I had dated while I was in college. I had a few, some of them even a girl at University, but only one. I couldn't tell much about his past. I guess that the one that caught my eye was the guy from the cruise. He just grinned and talked to me. I didn't say very much either.</p> <p>What I did say to him left little doubt in my mind about my feelings for him. I felt bad about taking his boat. I would take his boat. I wasn't going to tell him what had happened. I would take his boat.</p> <p>"What's going on," Sam asked me, interrupting my feelings.</p> <p>"That wasn't me."</p> <p>"Is it? How do you think he feels?"</p> <p>"Like he doesn't want to come. He doesn't think he can handle the thought of you being here with me."</p> <p>"And with me?"</p> <p>"Why would you think that? It's not like we're going to fuck each other. You can say it is if we're not being honest with each other."</p> <p>"I guess not. It can't be the same with him."</p> <p>"He's just not the same as I thought he was. I had expected a different sort of relationship with him, I guess."</p> <p>"So how do you feel about my decision?" I thought. I wanted the boat because of him. I didn't want to say that he could stay to come with me. I wanted him to stay there with me so that I didn't have to deal with him for the first time.</p> <p>It was hard to say, but I did. I just knew that he had to know. This just reminded me that, well, he could have said what he needed to. He was not going to stay with me. But he did say that I could walk with him. I had his back. I trusted him that I could choose him. We would talk about it when we got back.</p> <p>"I don't know what to think about it. There have, been times when I think I've really had everything I needed, not to say, I did it for you, when I can't control my actions. I've thought about you, about the way we looked at each other. I've wanted you. I've considered what we'd like to do...ifâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
