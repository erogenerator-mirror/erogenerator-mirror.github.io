I laughed. "I got it for you, too!" It's just like you like it."</p> <p>"Okay, it is," he admitted, and he reached over and gently stroked my dick through my pants.</p> <p>He continued stroking. "So you do like the blow job, huh?"</p> <p>I nodded. I didn't dare lie, either. But I needed to lie. I'd like just to know what was going on with him, or perhaps it felt wrong to ask, or perhaps it felt natural.</p> <p>"Well, if that turns you on," he added. "Want a blowjob?"</p> <p>I felt my cheeks flush. I could feel my cock swell. "Uh, sure," I said. "Sure." But I'm getting a little overwhelmed with what is actually going on between us now. It takes time to actually make up your mind before it's actually going to happen, even if it is just that. And with all this talking, I feel like I'm going to be the one who ends his night with a blow job?</p> <p>When I walked to the coffee house after college, I couldn't wait to get home. The more I thought about this, the more aroused I became, wondering what that might entail. It's a little different every year, isn't it? A month later, and it's really just a blow job?</p> <p>I didn't have long to wait. The first thing I knew was that after class all of the young guys there wanted blow jobs, and I think most of the women in the place wanted them. I know a lot of the guys thought it was because I had the look of a boy with a dick, and there was one right around the corner whose dick I would have loved to be getting a blow job from. We also knew that it was something I would have done just a little earlier in the week anyway, so it was a no brainer.</p> <p>I took my bag out of the car and went to the bathroom. I couldn't believe how aroused I was, and the fact that it felt like I had a hard-on all the way home. I thought that I had a perfect life. Sure, it was a perfect life, but I liked it. In fact, there was not much to it except the fact that life was full of pleasure and all those other bad things. And now, I was going to be the proud owner of a perfect life that just might take me to places I never thought possible.</p> <p>As I exited the classroom the second the bell rang, the rest of the girls came in. I felt a little better, but it still surprised me more that I didn't have to look back. The whole class was at the same table as before (only a third of them were male – almost like a third of the girls in the rest of the class – and probably a few other guys – even a few men). And no one knew that this time I didn't have a dick that was going to get me laid.</p> <p>The entire class took care of the math thing, and then a few men came along.</p> <p>I guess I've been there about 3 weeks now and it was a nice feeling. I was happy for the sex, and I really didn't worry about the blow job thing. I wasn't sure that I wanted it, but it still felt right.</p> <p>I had a couple of really nice blow jobs when I was in college, I'd always had good grades, like most of the guys I got involved with wanted to get me off. The only problem I found out about the girls in the class, is that I could actually get off by fantasizing about being the one doing a blow job, but the girls all thought they were helping me through school to make sure that was always the case. Some of them didn't really know it, but they seemed like they liked it too.</p> <p>In some ways, those girls were kind of creepy. A lot of the guys just seemed to think that I was a nice guy, just because I sucked their dicks. I guess it made me feel weird when they thought that.</p> <p>I hadn't had a girlfriend in 3 weeks, but I knew that with all the things that happened at college that it was going to feel that way now. Especially since I knew that it would never last.</p> <p>Finally, after getting really horny the whole time that I was in college, I got some relief as I finished up my calculus homework.</p> <p>It was time for me to get home, so I headed right back to my dorm. It's been 3 weeks since I left this class and I couldn't believe how horny I was. I didn't even see him in the room—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
