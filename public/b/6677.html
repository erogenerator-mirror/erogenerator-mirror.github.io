"No, no, no, no." He turns toward me, grinning impishly. "I don't want to give you the money. But, since you came up with these, I'm sure you would be interested. You can count it if you want. The one thing is, how did we get started? You've only been into sucking women and I haven't. Besides, I thought you'd like a taste of what it is like, to play with women."</p> <p>I look away, looking toward the doorway. It looks as if the manager is standing there. I think it would be more like a customer, though I can't see the owner.</p> <p>"You sure?" he asks. "It's just a bit of fun at first, isn't it?"</p> <p>"It's just for a bit of fun, I guess. I was looking out for my job, and that's all." I reply.</p> <p>"Don't worry. The man's already been down on one girl. A couple of times." He walks around to where I am standing. "You're just a guy, aren't you? You might want to try some of those big, black dongs that they sell, too.</p> <p>I realize that my skirt was riding up a bit, and that he has clearly spotted it. I feel awkward standing there in those shoes.</p> <p>The man comes close to me and pulls me to him. "It's not a guy, you know. It's just a girl. A girl that likes big black cocks, and you just happen to be one. What about you, right?"</p> <p>"I don't know. I don't know anyone I'd want to do anything with, or even to. I thought you were going to ask me to join you." I reply. "I'm so sorry, Mr. White. If you really did like me, it's because you are attracted."</p> <p>"So am I. The woman I'm interested in is black, but your man is white and this is her black man. And the man in the corner would just love you, right? He's nice looking, too. And she really likes you - he doesn't mind you having a bit of fun."</p> <p>He pulls me behind him toward the door. He holds an overcoat out to me. "The man in front can join you. Come on, you can change your mind about it."</p> <p>I'm surprised. I have never been the subject of my own sex life before. In other relationships - no - my husband has gone down on many times. But, to be honest, I'm not sure there's any sex in this world. Not in real life.</p> <p>He leads me out of the men's shop, to where he leads me to another hallway with a mirror. There is a mirror in front of a door that leads out of the store. Inside is a black man standing in the middle of the hallway, naked except for the black cologne that the manager used. He has a penis in his hand, and a cock in his hand. I am frightened at what might be going on behind that mirror.</p> <p>The manager turns on the lights and turns toward me. He looks me over and says, "You're going to have to come with me, don't you think?"</p> <p>I tell him no. I don't want him to. He's going to give me the job. My fears come into play again.</p> <p>"There's one more thing," the man says and gestures to my clothes. "You're not ready yet. In fact, you might be interested in something I offered you."</p> <p>He pulls up a chair and sits. He sits and I slip my skirt up just a bit just a little bit. He doesn't say anything. I stand in front of him.</p> <p>"You can't expect me to do all this," he says. "I want the job. This is your fantasy. You were willing to suck white cock." He puts a finger to his lips. "So, now you do!"</p> <p>"But," he interrupts. "I don't know what you're interested in." I can see he's looking my breasts up and down, and his eyes are looking into my black eyes as he starts talking. "I've had many fantasies about you. I've even thought about sucking your nipple. I've even thought about eating your pussy."</p> <p>I nod. "You can do that," I say. "I want to do the same with you."</p> <p>The manager stands up and walks around behind me. "What about all your body, then?" he asks me, his voice dripping with authority.</p> <p>"Please, not in front of your bossâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
