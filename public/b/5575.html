"I'm sorry. Not for how I acted but for how I'm acting today. I would never do anything like that. It's just that you have to know about my past a little more. What I have told you was wrong, I'm glad it happened and I don't blame you. I don't even know what you would think of my past in the way that you might think of mine." He took a few swallows trying to recover his courage and took me into his arms, holding me like a newborn baby not noticing he was trembling, his head against my chest. This had to be our first time. I couldn't understand how he could have become emotionally attached to me like this. I was stunned at his tenderness and I was so overwhelmed by his affection.</p> <p>"I have wanted for so long to be this close with you. It's been so long and I haven't been with a man much like you in a, well, years, no not years. I've wanted to be with you so very long to take you home but I'm too old for that. I don't want to leave you." Tears were forming in my eyes again and he saw the moisture from my tears run down his face. There was something else.</p> <p>"No," I said, "what? You don't love me. I married you and you did everything wrong. I just want to be with you, but I don't want to be with you forever. I won't let myself become attached to you, but I will, just not without you." My eyes were red and swollen with tears and I was shaking again. He just held me, never let my emotions go and I was so weak. Tears were running down my cheek again.</p> <p>"I don't love you and I don't want to be with you. You're married and I thought you meant that much about us." I said, my eyes searching his.</p> <p>"No it doesn't," he said. "It's not about us. It's about you. You're the only one I want to be with." He got up and left the office leaving me sitting there with tears in my eyes. Was he really saying that? Did he really think I would want to be with someone much like myself? Oh God, he was just being crazy. It was impossible.</p> <p>He came back and put his arms around me, pulling me close and holding me sobbing on his shoulder, tears still flowing. I just sat sobbing on his lap, feeling his emotions. I just closed my eyes as I felt him stroking my hair and telling me how much he wanted to be with me. He didn't leave me alone. He was the only man for me and it was time for us to be together again. There was no doubt at all that I would have to be with him just to say yes. He wasn't the only one like me. What was I going to do about all this stuff? I just had to be honest now. I couldn't be a whore, could I? My marriage was over I had to trust him. If I did, would he have to leave me? I couldn't tell him and that would be disastrous. I had to trust him.</p> <p>He looked into my eyes and said, "We will figure something out and make it work. I don't think you need to be with me anymore. You're mine now. I want you here with me and I do. I just want to make it alright one more time." He leaned me against the wall, cradling me and kissing me. I kissed him back passionately, pulling his lips with my hands and feeling him become hard. He pulled back from me and whispered, "You're not ready to lose me yet."</p> <p>Now I could be with him again and I wasn't so sure that there was anything left to lose, even if he just wanted to be with me again. I didn't want to lose him and I felt I would lose him to the world. But just as the thought came suddenly to me I felt tears drip down my cheeks.</p> <p>"I've got to make a phone call," I said, still feeling so shy.</p> <p>"But, you'll be upset," he said, "it's you who should be upset."</p> <p>I stood up and wiped my eyes and said, "I'll still come back and just be with you when I want to be with you. Please do not leave me."</p> <p>"No," he said, "you need to have somebody around you that you can rely on. Don't worry it'll be fine. We will take care of everything else."</p> <p>I didn't know what that meant, how he said that I didn't understand. What he said was true, but what he said meant to be true too.
