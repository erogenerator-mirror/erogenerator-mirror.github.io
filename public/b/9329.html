She stopped at the back of the salon with a bottle of lotion in hand. I looked down but couldn't make out the details as she started working. The front of her bathing suit was now completely bare. She worked my chest, belly and legs, getting my legs warm before she straddled me. She rubbed lotion into my stomach and thighs, letting me rest a bit as she did so.</p> <p>As she continued to work her way towards my boxers it dawned on me that she had a surprise for me this time. A surprise that would keep me from cumming.</p> <p>"Mmmm, just let it happen," I mused to myself.</p> <p>As she began to pull my underwear down she leaned back to take my cock into her mouth again. She didn't have a lot of experience when it came to sucking off guys, and I really didn't know what this was going to be the first time I'd been with a girl. She sucked me off pretty well, and I really appreciated being able to go back so soon that second. I felt her tongue against me again, and I told her I was close. She kept at it and I was finally there; my body jerked and I had a massive orgasm. A second later I was cumming in her mouth a third time. Then I was spent. After all the cum we had experienced and many more like that I just lay there, thinking it would be ok to fuck her.</p> <p>I got up and went back to my spot in the living room. She came in when she was finished with my legs and I could hear her doing a belly button ring. She had a smile on her face as she walked, and she said she would see me later about the bikini.</p> <p>I sat down on the couch and waited, my cock throbbing hard and waiting to be stroked. After about forty five minutes I heard the front door open, and my wife's voice say "it's time to get dressed."</p> <p>"You know who she is, don't you, Jeff?"</p> <p>"Of course I do."</p> <p>My wife turned around to walk the other way, then she opened the door saying "just wanted to come and see how you were doing."</p> <p>I said "thank you" in reply to hearing her say "I've been waiting for three weeks for you to finally come out for me. I want to know all about all these changes you've been enjoying, and what happened in your life. I just want to know what it's like to have a man in there with you, and what an amazing lover he is." I turned around to smile at her and continued saying "You can go, we won't be long."</p> <p>And that is exactly what we did.</p> <p>We drove to the local beach house, and went from there. I spent the evening in her place, getting her all warmed up on some kind of massage, lying on her stomach while doing the same to me. Our first time had been almost to a point of leaving. We had planned a very different day each night... and we did it, each time feeling more, but not enough to get to the last one, we made sure to finish it as well. I loved being close to my wife, and especially loving her, but right now she was not in that state of mind of her earlier this afternoon; she had got to experience some amazing sex.</p> <p>It started when she was lying on her stomach. It wasn't a massage. It was something else. What it was was something she had never been really into, but she was into it now. She said she had always been into the "just don't let me down" routine, and for more than a few years it had been followed by some other "just don't let me down". The way she was lying, and her body was starting to do it for me, she knew that what she was doing was very sexy, but this time it seemed like she was really enjoying it. It was different from massaging her, not in a mean way. It was loving and affectionate. Not like I was with her or anything, like I liked to do it to a partner.</p> <p>And so it continued. After the long day of our vacation, we had both been through a lot. She had felt a certain thrill about a job change being at her house, and for a second it had been a dream. Then the buzzer came, and all of a sudden it became real. In that instant she decided she wanted to fuck him, and she wasn't surprised when he showed up the next afternoon. She had told me in the beginning that he was bisexual and had told her his preference, to which I could not disagree. He was not the type of guy I would have datedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
