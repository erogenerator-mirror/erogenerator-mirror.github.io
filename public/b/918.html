I had a huge grin on my face.</p> <p>"You're going to have to help me find my underwear for today."</p> <p>"Don't worry," I smiled. "Hmmm."</p> <p>Hearing her hesitate a moment, I looked her up and down. Her skin glistened in the moon-lit bathroom, her hair hanging down around her shoulders and her eyes dilated in anticipation.</p> <p>"You want me to do this for you?" I asked, running my hands through her shoulder length brunette hair.</p> <p>"Yes." she said, opening her eyes and raising a eyebrow at me.</p> <p>"Hmmm," I moaned before taking a small step back and pulling my shirt off, leaving me completely naked, feeling even more vulnerable.</p> <p>She was right, and before I could react to her touch, I had her pinned against the wall and my tongue in her mouth. She was so wet from this that she groaned into my mouth and wrapped her arms around my neck, sucking on me with a desperate need.</p> <p>I pulled back from her and leaned her against the wall, pushing her skirt up and lifting her legs over my waist. I rubbed my cock up and down her slit, feeling it pushing through her skin, already wet by her juices. I slid my cock inside her, loving the way she was so tight around me.</p> <p>I started fucking her, leaning against the door with her legs wrapped around my waist as we rolled along the floor. Every inch of my cock was sliding in and out of her wet pussy. Her body trembled with every movement, her back arching to meet every thrust. She was whimpering and moaning, and my cock slid down her pussy with every thrust, causing her clit to rub against the wall and send her body into a tingly feeling.</p> <p>I pushed myself all the way into her, groaning.</p> <p>"Fuck me," I panted.</p> <p>"I'd like to," she managed.</p> <p>We moved together, my thick cock thrusting into her with every thrust. Her muscles clenched around me in a tight grip, and her face lit up. Her eyes fluttered closed so her mouth formed an O and she moaned, as if I would just continue fucking her until she came, but instead, I pushed into her as my teeth scraped her neck.</p> <p>She was gasping and moaning my name; I was the only one that knew what she was saying, but I knew my lips were going numb and my tongue out to lick every inch of her neck. Her body tensed and I felt the orgasm begin to build.</p> <p>I pulled out of her and she moaned as I turned her around and she stepped forward so I could get my cock back inside her, grabbing a hold of my hips and pulling me all the way in. I was so deep inside her that she gasped.</p> <p>I moaned and pounded into her hard, taking the first of two orgasms with my thick cock. Her muscles were contracting around me, milking at my cock, and I could feel my cock throbbing as I pumped into her.</p> <p>She was moaning and crying my name and pulling my hips to her face as she came, soaking my cock with her juices.</p> <p>I grabbed her hair again, pulling her face down to my lips so I could kiss her there and we made out for a minute, letting the last of our orgasms roll on and on. I finally released my grip on her head, and she broke our kiss for another minute, letting her face back up. She stood up again from her position against the wall, and I took her by the waist and pulled her back against me.</p> <p>"How was that," I moaned, running my hands up and down her sides, feeling her body through the thin fabric of her clothes. Her breasts were heaving with every breath, and her hands rested on my shoulders, tracing her fingers over my muscles.</p> <p>"That was very, very good," she gasped, before leaning forward and kissing me again. "I have to go home now," she said as she slid off of me. "I had to get some things from the bathroom," she added, as if it would break my heart if I knew she was walking away with a smile on her face.</p> <p>"Can I get you anything besides this," I chuckled.</p> <p>"Maybe if you had something from me, that would be nice," she laughed.</p> <p>"You're so sweet." I rolled my eyes. "Seriously though," I said, "I need to go," and I got up from the bathroomâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
