Her body seemed to tremble under his, her lips pressed against his, her breath warm against his cheek.</p> <p>"Now, I am going to take you over the top. You have to be the hardest, most passionate, best sex ever, with all the skill and effort you just have. Now... please don't stop fucking me. Yes! Keep going!"</p> <p>He felt his wife's body shake and tremble with each powerful thrust of her lover. Even if it took every ounce of willpower to resist, he could resist the desire to cum inside her. But the strength of her lover kept them going and the force that caused him to do it kept him from doing so. He wanted this to last, he wanted to make this feel like it had never felt before, to keep this woman's words in his memory forever. He wanted to make this moment as much about her words as things were.</p> <p>It started when she spoke them, and it began as a string of short cries, a string of unintelligible sounds. Her voice seemed to float under the haze that surrounded them and her hips started to buck involuntarily. Her eyes slammed shut as she rode them out and he felt himself losing control, thrusting faster and harder. He felt a flood of sensation and then the first wave of a powerful orgasm overtook her, forcing his own orgasm to explode. Her body arched and convulsed under him as their bodies both exploded. He cried out into the night as their bodies shook in orgasm and he felt his own climax overtake him, leaving a large wet spot across his thighs.</p> <p>He felt himself go slowly, his strength subsiding, but he felt the pleasure of being able to breathe and felt a new rush of arousal. He thought he could feel the tension in his body as he watched in fascination as the woman's body relaxed above him while he remained inside her. As their breaths came back to normal, he watched her face, flushed with the fire that had been ignited in her body. She leaned down and kissed his cheek before she straightened up and walked out of the room.</p> <p>He smiled up at it, feeling the smile as she did. He smiled at her expression as well; they both enjoyed the sight. This woman... this woman had the presence of mind to stay, but he didn't see how their relationship had changed. All that he knew was that he'd loved her. He loved her, and felt a renewed sense of desire for her. For a moment he wondered if it couldn't possibly change things with her if he didn't. A smile curved from his lips, and he felt the same. Suddenly, his whole body stiffened as he felt his erection grow hard and pulsating against his thigh. He moaned softly. A woman's voice drifted closer. "Hello? You're awake." She didn't let him move his head from her chest, and he felt her shift on the bed a little. "Your husband might be coming too," she whispered, her voice a little deeper. "Maybe he'll come to find you when you're better."</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>Dana lay in bed, her body still covered in cum and sweat even though she'd enjoyed it. A wave of warmth traveled through her as she lay there with the memories of last night flashing across her mind. A second wave of warmth washed over her as she heard the sound of footsteps approaching the hotel room door. "My name is Dawn," she whispered aloud.</p> <p>She could hear the voice of her lover's father as he came into the room. He smiled when he saw her and looked back at her. "Hello baby," he whispered and kissed her cheek softly. "Happy anniversary, you?" When he saw his wife's expression, he smiled. "Thank you for being a little wild. I know you have some problems with your husband but I love it when you fuck me. I wanted what you and you could have. We love each other." Dana smiled back and kissed his cheek, which he returned, pulling her close. "I love you honey."</p> <p>"I love you, too." He kissed her forehead before he turned and walked into the bathroom. It was the only space on the bed that he remembered when he saw her showering with her husband back in late April. It would serve him right no longer. He'd be looking out for his wife, his lover's mother, and his wife's life.</p> <p>Dana's heart beat a little faster as she thought about her night with her husband. She had liked the feeling of having his tongue in her pussy. She'd come to love it soâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
