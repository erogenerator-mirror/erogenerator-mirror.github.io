She went to bed with me and all of a sudden we were gone. What's wrong with the two of us?" He said.</p> <p>"I guess we got caught." I said.</p> <p>"Yes. Very fucking lucky for you." He said, looking back over his shoulder.</p> <p>He turned back his gaze back to me. I was still staring at the floor but now looking over his shoulder.</p> <p>"No," I said. "We shouldn't let this happen."</p> <p>"No?" He said. "Of course we shouldn't let it. You don't have to take that next step."</p> <p>And before I could object, I had pulled my clothes off and walked over to the bed. I climbed on it and lay down next to him. He started to get on top of me, but I grabbed his cock and squeezed lightly. Once I had it in my hand, I lay it down and began slowly stroking it and kissing him, before I began kissing his neck and slowly kissing my way to his ear. He started to moan softly and started rubbing his fingers against my lips, which I parted to let him slide through them. Slowly, he pushed his cock towards my face. I kissed it down the side, before I let it press it's way between my lips and against my mouth. It was so cold, the way I usually have it when I'm in the shower or in front of its own mirror. I could smell my pussy. He held his dick with one hand and let it go. I got up and lay in the middle of the bed, my hips in the air, my pussy on display. He looked at me and smiled. I sat with my knees spread apart and his cock on the bed, waiting for him. Slowly, I slowly worked my way down until my nose was almost in his pubes. His dick was wet with my saliva. I took it and rubbed it over my lips before slowly pushing it towards the back of my mouth. His pre-cum tasted like sandpaper and I just wanted him in my mouth. I wanted his dick in my pussy, to make the last few minutes last forever. His cock was a little shorter than mine and I knew exactly where it went. I tried it and it started to go in, in, out, in, out. I wanted to feel him in me at any moment. Now I wanted to feel him in my mouth. I pulled it out and brought the head to the lips, just below. After sliding his cock all the way in, I placed the head where my tongue was and sucked it in. I was just using my lips to move my mouth over his dick, like I was moving, so he would come in my mouth. He didn't mind. "Oh God, Yes, that feels so good" was all I could say.</p> <p>I was doing what he liked, slowly making him crazy. I slowly took as much of his hard cock as I could, my lips sliding around it all the way up and down. His hand played with my hair to keep it nice and messy. I kept it in place for the longest time. Every few seconds he would push it in gently, but I would feel it all the way out, before he would pull his cock out. I loved the feeling of his dick inside my mouth. I slowly pulled back, and then quickly started working the underside of the head over my tongue. He was moaning louder than before but I think he was enjoying himself. I kept rubbing him and I could tell that he was getting close. I slowed down my pace so that he would last longer. After about 40 minutes of this, my jaw was tired and a little sore, but I wanted it to last forever. I could feel him push it in gently. "That's it baby, it's all in. Just do to me whatever you want."</p> <p>It was an out of body experience for me. I was exhausted. I could feel his cum inside my pussy, so I would not be able to do this for long.</p> <p>"Fuck" was all I could say and he pulled his dick out. It was clean as though my lipstick was smeared on on it. He looked at me and smiled, then crawled out the room without saying goodnight. I was still asleep and got up to go to my bed room.</p> <p>When I came back, my stomach was still sore, and there wasn't that much going on. I felt tired and happy all at the same time, so I went up there and tried to think of something else. It was nothing, nothing I wanted to do... I didn't know what else. I finally got up and went in to bed. It wasn't quite a room. It had a couch and chair, or even a bed. I sat there in the dark, feeling a bit lonely, but nothing I needed. After half an hour or so, I began toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
