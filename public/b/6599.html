I was almost ready for another bout of lovemaking and I just wasn't sure how to broach the subject.</p> <p>When I got in the shower I knew she couldn't resist asking me if I wanted to go to bed with her. I had no problem with it, and if her answer was yes she was probably right. She turned the shower off, pulled my body into hers and kissed me deeply. She pulled back after a kiss, laughed, turned the shower off and climbed into bed.</p> <p>'I'll get to that soon,' she murmured, 'just think about it a little.'</p> <p>I agreed and soon drifted off to sleep.</p> <p>The next morning I was up and was walking down the hall to the room to see her sitting up on the bed. She had her head propped up in the pillows, smiling at me. She looked beautiful.</p> <p>'How was your trip last night?' she asked.</p> <p>'It was okay. I didn't have anything planned except to stay the night.'</p> <p>'Oh. I was wondering if you were in love with me last night.'</p> <p>'I'm in love with you, Lisa. I wouldn't change anything with love, but something came up. I really don't know what it is, but one thing is for sure. You're the most beautiful woman who ever lived.'</p> <p>'Thanks, but I'm the most beautiful woman, too. I love you so.'</p> <p>'No, really,' I said. 'I'd like to spend this weekend with you for a week or two.'</p> <p>'Okay,' she said. 'Let's see what you got.'</p> <p>I helped her to her feet, and led her to the bed. We kissed and I put my arms around her. She melted into my arms. I carried her over to the dresser, set her down on it, and kissed her on the forehead. I slipped her shoes off and set the things aside. I kissed her feet, knees and ankles as I took her dress and blouse off. I tossed everything in the pile as I went back to get the rest. When I returned I put on my jeans and a T-shirt before getting into bed and giving her a quick kiss. She came into the room in a bra and a pair of panties before she got into bed with me.</p> <p>'Do you want to hold me?' I heard her whisper.</p> <p>'Nope,' I whispered back. I put my hand where hers had been, and we embraced in deep, passionate, toe to toe kisses. She reached between us and cupped my cock in her hand and began stroking it. I was hard, and as hard as I've been in years.</p> <p>'I had an idea. Can you put the kettle on and make us some coffee?'</p> <p>'Not right now, I'm too hot to sleep. You know that right?'</p> <p>I kissed her again and put a nipple in my mouth, as my dick was so hard it hurt. Lisa gave me a look that said 'yes'.</p> <p>I poured a little coffee, got two cups and got into bed beside her.</p> <p>'Are we going to have sex again?' she asked.</p> <p>'Do you want me to ask you if you could?'</p> <p>'If I can?'</p> <p>'Can I ask you if you can tell me about the things you did today?'</p> <p>'You could ask me now.'</p> <p>'Are you really a lesbian?' I asked.</p> <p>'Yes.'</p> <p>'And you are willing to tell me about yourself?'</p> <p>Lisa giggled. 'I think the most important thing is sex.'</p> <p>'You have no idea. I've been listening to stories about you.'</p> <p>'How have I listened to the stories?'</p> <p>I took her nipple in between my teeth and teased it with my tongue.</p> <p>'You are a sexologist.'</p> <p>'Really? I don't believe that. I know you like sex, but it's not much fun when we're together.'</p> <p>'Do you like sex?' I asked her, as her nipple sprang into my tongue.</p> <p>She grinned and said, 'Yes.'</p> <p>I took her nipple in my mouth again and began to suck it gently.</p> <p>'Is that good?'</p> <p>'It feels good.'</p> <p>'I like that,' I said. 'Your nipple is so hard.'</p> <p>As if my question was directed at her and I didn't want to answer it I moved to her other nipple. I teased both with my tongue and teeth.</p> <p>'Now, do youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
