My wife was the wife of a professional athlete, and for the first time I had a chance to talk to her and meet some people.</p> <p>She and her husband had decided to make the trip to Vegas this year, and she had been looking forward to her trip all week so, even though I had a big weekend planned, she was still excited, especially as she had always said "you're the man that got me this way in the first place, now give me a break and keep working!"</p> <p>Sitting at our table and talking to a handsome guy she had just met, I was trying to find out about what she had been going through, just to see what it would take to move to a more stable life than she had been living at home. I tried to be polite, and even tried to look around to see how we might fit together. I told her that I had a very pretty wife and I didn't want to lose the woman she had always wanted...but I also wanted to get to know her the way she had once always wanted to be. We finished a few beers and she said "oh, well thanks for the heads-up for me. The next day they're going to fly to Nashville, just over there by the airport"</p> <p>We laughed as I told her "damn, even with that all on my mind! So, you've been looking for a new man"</p> <p>"Y'know, I think I know the one" she said, a little sarcastically. "Yeah, you've got the one! You're not getting laid around here, are you? You'll just be one of those horny college co-eds that never get enough. You're gonna live with some guys that think they're making you do things that you can't do here, or if you want to come to this country, maybe have me join you and my family! The truth is, I've told a couple of the guys on the phone that I'm just too hot to just hang around with guys in bars that don't even own a damn bar full of alcohol! Well, I've had enough drink; besides being a good wife, I don't think I can do much more than drink...and, I really am not getting laid tonight or tomorrow!!"</p> <p>I could tell that she was beginning to get a little irritated, and then she was looking toward where we sat, when an old guy with a big smile said something like "Hey, thanks again, it's good to see you here. There's the woman I remember telling you about."</p> <p>With a quick glance at her, she smiled, not looking at the guy, and told him "oh, that's right, this is the guy who told me about your trip. How about you? Wasn't that one of your friends?"</p> <p>"Yup" he said "so long as you got lucky with him"</p> <p>"He's a good friend, you know! Hey, what do I do now?"</p> <p>"You'll just have to wait" she told him as she handed him my business card, "I have some business plans to help you with, and I'm sure you're not getting laid tonight!" As she was saying this, her eyes were glistening as they traveled over the man's broad chest and bulging biceps, which appeared to be in excellent shape as they strained to get through some tight t-shirt, and she smiled even before he could hear the laughter she used to put on her, and to her own surprise, he blushed a bright red.</p> <p>"So, what's my wife telling me about you?" he said as he leaned forward for a kiss, obviously trying to hide a large amount of himself and looking over at her, only the look of the smile he was giving me could be seen over his shoulder at this point.</p> <p>"Oh, just that you've got a hot wife waiting for you" said the man, while he pulled his t-shirt over his head and dropped it to the ground, showing off that great body he had, and I almost saw the expression on her face change as she realized I was watching.</p> <p>"Well" I said getting up from my seat to get my beer, "I think my wife is really looking forward to your trip, as I'm sure she has been very excited to hear your stories from our friend."</p> <p>"Well, it's nice talking to her, isn't it?"</p> <p>"She's my wife, her friend is your wife. You got me. Why are they always talking about our friend?"</p> <p>Sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
