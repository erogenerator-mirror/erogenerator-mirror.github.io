They began making out with urgency and urgency, rubbing and probing each other's clits until they both came violently. The pair fell together for a second time and she broke the lip lock on her boyfriend. Then, she gave him two more quick pecks on his nose that caused him to gasp for breath. She turned herself around and lay down on top of him, straddling him, kissing him, and holding each other tightly.</p> <p>"I have so much to do tonight," she said. "I need a break before I change my mind."</p> <p>"Is that so?" he replied, "and I mean for a break: have an adventure with the most beautiful creature you've ever see!" he said before they even got any further.</p> <p>"You have no idea of how much of a thrill it is to have someone else watch me go from guy to guy for just a while." She said, "It's my job to make this a great, unforgettable time. I'd love for it to be a big time event. And it's definitely special."</p> <p>"Well," he said, "what are we going to do tonight? Tell me to call you when we have some alone time, then I would be happy to join you. Let's hope that my sister doesn't mind, but at the same time I don't want to intrude on our private little time now."</p> <p>"Oh. She doesn't mind," she said as she kissed him, "but I guess I'm just a little jealous." She laughed a little as her boyfriend grabbed his t-shirt off the floor. "What about you? If you feel like taking me upstairs again?"</p> <p>"I would love to, but I wouldn't feel comfortable in any of the bathrooms, either," he retorted, kissing her.</p> <p>In the meantime, she laid down on the floor, and he came up between her legs, which were already spread apart, and began rubbing his t-shirt up and down over her moist pussy. "Honey, no foreplay!" she said as she lifted her hips. "You can go for it right now, if it's okay by you." She grabbed one of her boyfriends and moved up until he was just inside her pussy. She turned toward him and placed both her hands in the small of his back. "I love you so much," she said as she guided his dickhead between her labia. "I want you to cum inside me. I need to feel your cock cum inside me."</p> <p>He started pumping, and in just a few seconds, she started moaning that he was close. He continued pumping her until he was about to go "Ohhhh!" She pulled his head down and kissed him, "I know you're so close. Cum with me!" She quickly reached her second orgasm of the night.</p> <p>As soon as his cum shot out of his dick and landed on the floor, he began pumping again and came inside her.</p> <p>"We shouldn't do that," she said. "I'm too horny!" But she had no intention of stopping him; and they rolled apart like lovers in love. They continued their lovemaking until it was time to go home. Both of them were very tired, but neither of them wanted to waste a single minute of itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
