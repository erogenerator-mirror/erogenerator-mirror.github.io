I haven't done it in a while." As I said that my face and my chest were now against the couch cushions. It wasn't hard for him to take notice of my body because the tightness of my bra was causing it to strain.</p> <p>"Then that's ok with me," he said, his eyes now locked on my face. I don't usually get shy around guys but I don't usually get shy around guys. "Let's get comfortable!" he said, pointing at the chair across from us. I sat down, and he quickly kicked off his shoes. I looked up at him and he stared back at me, then reached his right arm out and grabbed a cushion from the nearest sofa. Taking the hint as he moved across to the other side of the couch, I stood up, leaving my shoes on.</p> <p>We chatted for a minute or two until the tension in his eyes became almost palpable. We'd been talking on and off since his "date" had started out and I knew I was going to make him pay for that.</p> <p>"You have this thing for my shoes?" he blurted.</p> <p>"No, nothing, really." I paused to see if my tone was right and found it pretty straight. I had never acted this way about a guy before. Maybe it was because I was nervous too.</p> <p>"Well, I'd like to kiss you then," I said. "Is that ok?"</p> <p>"Yes, I've always been attracted to beautiful girls." This seemed the furthest thing he'd ever brought up in any conversation he'd had with me. I took in a deep breath, then said, "Do you like to kiss?"</p> <p>"Ahhhh, yeah." He looked a little uncomfortable at my request and I could see his cock jump in his pants.</p> <p>"Well, what do you think I should do to get over it?"</p> <p>"Well, I don't know. But..." He trailed off and just sat there, his eyes transfixed on my face and chest, as if he couldn't quite believe what he should do next. I thought for a minute and decided it would be a good idea to start with his kisses first.</p> <p>I leaned in close and whispered in his ear, "If there was anything I wanted to do to get you to kiss me again," I said, "I think the best thing would be just to just do it!" His eyes glazed over and he closed them again, staring at me with lustful eyes.</p> <p>At that point I decided to take the initiative. "Ok, but you better do it," I said, "Because I want you to kiss me." With that I kissed him gently on the lips and leaned in to him. His lips were cool and soft and soon his tongue was dancing with mine. When their tango broke I pulled back, breathing hard, but not taking my eyes off his.</p> <p>"I want more," I said softly. He nodded and I stepped back again so I could get down on my knees. I unzipped his pants and removed his beautiful erection. I kissed the tip of it and took the head into my mouth, tasting his precum. I slowly slid my lips down the shaft and back up, working my tongue over him, as he groaned in approval at the slow and sensual action. I moved up and started at the very base of his shaft again, my hand stroking him faster.</p> <p>"Ohh..." he said, his breath coming fast.</p> <p>I stopped momentarily and ran my tongue across his cockhead again, then moved up again and put just the tip in my mouth. I sucked lightly on the head, licking the length of it. He was breathing hard and moaning and I knew he was about to blow. I kept my eyes on his face so I could see how the expression on his face was one of extreme ecstasy and frustration.</p> <p>"Yes...yes..." he groaned, then I felt him tense and I felt the warmth of his cockhead in my mouth.</p> <p>"Yes," I encouraged, "gonna do it, yes." I could hardly wait until I was finished. I felt his hips thrust upward and his hand was against the back of my head, guiding me. "Oh-god yes!" he hissed. His body shuddered and I felt his cock pulsate as he shot his load. It filled the back of my mouth quickly and I couldn't swallow as much of him as a man can produce, but I didn't care. As his body relaxed I felt like a dirty whore taking my own load from a man, but I didn't care. His hand went back to my shoulders, pushing me back so I sat back on the cushion and he leaned over me againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
