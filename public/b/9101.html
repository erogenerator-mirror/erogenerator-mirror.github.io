He slid his cock into her warm cunt, she felt it penetrate inside as far as it was going to go. She moaned and shuddered in anticipation of his entry with her, feeling that he was deep inside her, deep inside her and she loved it.</p> <p>She began to move her waist toward him . . . her legs moving to lock behind his and holding on as they continued their intense passion . . . her hips moving in counterpoint to his as they moved with each other. He felt himself building toward his climax and she loved it as he was building towards his own, to his orgasm. "So beautiful" she thought. "I love you and you have made love to me . . . so beautiful."</p> <p>This was too much for David to bear. He came harder than he ever had with any woman he had been with. He felt her pussy tighten around him. She was having an orgasm, he felt her pussy contracting around him and she came for him. And he came for her. They were both orgasming . . . both enjoying each other's pleasure at the peak of ecstasy.</p> <p>They held each other and they kissed and shared their feelings with each other . . until they drifted back off to darkness. When they were back in the state of consciousness, they kissed and caressed each other tenderly, both wanting to make the love they were both looking to have.</p> <p>When they returned to their own reality, they found that both were in the same hotel and neither of them wanted to go to the door of that room. Neither of them wanted to leave this state they had found together . . . this realization was both frightening in its simplicity and exciting in its intensity.</p> <p>"I thought we were in love"</p> <p>"I didn't say that out loud "David" she said between kisses. "I thought we were lovers and never could be! What if he had no idea what he had been missing. We must be really crazy to be in love with each other!" she finished. "I just thought it would be a great experience to be with you this way."</p> <p>"To be with each other" he thought and said "to do . . . to love each other"</p> <p>"To enjoy each other" she said. "to be . . . to love each other." He kissed her softly and they held each other close and they went to sleep. It was the most exhilarating experience as far as David was concerned. Nothing else mattered, just a beautiful woman in the arms of a lover . . . their love had always been a deep, abiding passionâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
