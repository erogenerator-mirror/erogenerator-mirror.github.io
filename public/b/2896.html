We'll go to my house so you know where everything is!"</p> <p>"I agree," I said. "Let's go, then!"</p> <p>We agreed reluctantly to our plans for the entire evening.</p> <p>*</p> <p>"Well, come on, you two...let's check out the rest of the night," I said as I led her to the cab. "You can show your old man how much you love him, when we come back."</p> <p>"We'll be right back. And as much as we like to, I think we really want to meet your parents!"</p> <p>I had given the taxi driver a thumbs-up in the parking garage when we pulled behind me—I'd just had an experience I'd never thought I would ever have given up, but now I was getting nervous and excited all at the same time! A half hour later we were on my parent's black Buick, and there was no one to be found in the lot. It had belonged to a neighbor of mine! No one was ever around since they were old enough to vote! Oh yes, I knew that the neighbors would tell, and I liked that a lot!</p> <p>We started driving in the country, stopping at various places to eat or drink. We didn't get much, and as she passed into some of the more rural towns, we drove around to see where all the old buildings and places had been. I thought that she would just end up living there, and that we'd just end up just living it in. Then we pulled into the rest area of town and saw that the neighborhood around the swimming pool house had been closed off! I thought her parents might come home if we hadn't already been in the pool house, but all we saw was the old mansion. We stopped and looked at all the old buildings and places that we guessed were there since they had faded, but no signs of life ever even occurred. I pulled out my phone, dialed 911 and made a call.</p> <p>" 911, there's been an explosion!"</p> <p>"Fire! Fire, no one's been home!"</p> <p>"Fire, Fire," the dispatcher yelled, "all the signs that someone could have crashed into the house!"</p> <p>"No! No!" I said, "I'm sorry! I'll call you! I'll bring my mobile!" I hung up, and ran out to my car. I was a little worried, and a little fearful at the same time! We made the drive to her father's house, not even bothering to see if they were still out or even if someone else was home.</p> <p>My aunt gave me a deep kiss, and said, "Oh, come in, come on in! Are our neighbors still home?"</p> <p>We walked into the dark house, and my aunt was right as usual. What she saw in front of her when she saw me in my boxer-briefs was like a huge fucking elephant! It was at least 11-feet tall, and it was standing on top of a wall about twenty inches high. My aunt sat on the edge of the bed in an outfit that had seen better days as an actress and model, and some of her wardrobe had disappeared. Now, the only thing she looked like was the fact that I was standing there in just my boxer-briefs. But even though it was cold in that room, and while there wasn't a lot of anyone around, I was still shivering from the chill.</p> <p>"Hi!" she said, and gave me a quick hug! "We didn't expect you home from school today! It has to be at least two miles! I love this house! We've been wanting to do this for ages! We're going to have a good time tonight! Let's go over and get some food," she said, patting my cheek. "Come on!"</p> <p>She was carrying our shopping bag over to the kitchen that was in a corner of our kitchen. As the three of us walked down through the kitchen to the refrigerator, I looked at her. She looked absolutely great, and was already feeling pretty comfortable with her appearance! She turned to me and said, "Oh! This house looks so good! I'm so glad you came back! You guys had quite an affect on the house when I sold it! And I've got a housekeeper who runs all three businesses. You should be able to use this stuff!"</p> <p>Astonished at the revelation of our—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
