I can't! I've just about shit!</p> <p>"Don't you think someone is here?" she asked.</p> <p>"Well...maybe..." said Sam.</p> <p>"Go look on the internet, Sam, I will come out." She grabbed the man's arm and led him into the house. He followed her through the dimly light house, down the stairs into his living room.</p> <p>"Sam, wait." He shouted as he ran over to his wife.</p> <p>"What is going on?" she asked, seeing the light on and recognizing him.</p> <p>"Hello?" he said as he held his hand out to her.</p> <p>"Sam, meet Jack! You've never met my husband, Jack...you have to meet someone!" Sam's eyes widened in recognition at being called by her. "My husband...the man that you used to be with, that he was the man that you were with before you were married!... Jack, what's going on? Why is it that you are calling me by my name?" he explained.</p> <p>Jack looked from Sam to Jack, at their eyes, to himself and back again.</p> <p>"Sam...you know why I'm calling you?" Jack asked.</p> <p>"Well, yes! I have to get back and get my stuff and then I'm going outside, I'm alone here!" She replied.</p> <p>He nodded again, his eyes looking up at her. "I'm sorry, for what I did today, I'm just trying to...get a handle on what's going on in my life...Sam! I couldn't...have..." he said.</p> <p>"Why do you have to be alone? I heard the story from your computer but I still need to get back to work! Oh, and by the way...my name is Jack, by the way!" With that, Sam took Jack's hand and pulled him along, toward the basement of her house. Jack walked with her around the corner to the corner of her house and found what he needed to be there.</p> <p>"What's happening here?" he said. Sam turned to face him with her hands on her hips, her shoulders and waist. "Is something wrong?" he asked, concerned for himself and for her sister but also for Jack himself. Sam took Jack's hand and started to lead him down to her basement.</p> <p>"Sam, please help me! Please! I'm so sorry Jack!..." Jack just nodded in understanding. As Sam led Jack past the kitchen and the basement, the light on the door was still on, and Sam felt Jack's nervousness and fear. She was scared and she tried to act as if she didn't know what was going on in the basement with the stranger. She felt Jack's hand on her arm again but made no move to follow. Instead, with a big smile, Sam pulled Jack inside the door to her basement.</p> <p>"Sam...?" Jack called. Sam led Jack upstairs and down the stairs. "Jack, I don't blame you! If that man wasn't in here with you now, I just don't know what's good for me! He is an asshole and I don't care what he is!" Then he took her in his arms and started kissing her. "Sam, we need to talk. I'm sorry..." Sam had to pause to hold Jack's arm, then kiss him back, "Jack! I'm sorry. Please, at least talk with me! It has to be now!"</p> <p>Jack's fears were allayed a bit, Sam could tell. Sam wanted to make this up to Jack. She wanted to prove to him how good a husband can make him feel. Even though she wanted to show Jack she could not see how he could not. With a big smile, she led Jack into a room they had never seen before. She closed and locked the door to her basement. "Are we alone?" asked Sam.</p> <p>"You think that you know?..." asked Jack. Sam just nodded her head.</p> <p>"Can we see your bedroom?" asked Sam.</p> <p>"Not yet. Jack is there and is going to use his new bed room to sleep. You can have the bedroom down the hall upstairs and I'll be right back! Is that alright with you Sam?"</p> <p>Sam smiled and gave Jack a quick but friendly slap on the ass.</p> <p>"Ok Jack! We'll try this. I promise!" Sam had Jack standing next to her at a few feet. She took Jack's hands in hers, and walked him to the center of the room. She put Jack face down on the bed and took his hands behind his head. She looked him over carefully. It was not difficult. She started to unbutton his shirt, Jack's head still facing to the left.
