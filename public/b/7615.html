You guys should look forward to it too. What about you?" I nodded. "Yeah, I'll be happy to have you around."</p> <p>"Thanks," I told her in a hopeful tone. "When we come in, will you sign the new contract?"</p> <p>"No, that's not why I asked you to come in..." The way she asked, I knew that she was worried about meeting clients. "I just thought that maybe I'd work with you as the assistant manager so you could go over my resume. I've never been one to turn down a job before..." My face went white and I tried to look as innocent as possible.</p> <p>"No, no, that's not what I meant. You didn't give me the job you were expecting. If you hadn't..." She looked at me in disbelief. "You gave me the job, you were just letting me know the job was yours!" I looked at her as I finished the sentence. "Please, just forget it. We can't do that again," I assured her and added, "We'll make this up to you," to which she said "no..."</p> <p>"No, no, it's not that-"</p> <p>"Hey, I was doing you a service. A very nice job with the right person," I told her. "You don't have to worry, no harm will come to you. I'm sure that you'll understand if you have second thoughts." She looked at me expectantly.</p> <p>"Just wait and see," I said as I walked toward her and extended my hand. Taking her hand in mine I introduced the new contract to her.</p> <p>"Mr. Smith, I'm sorry to have the job," she said as she shook my hand. "I didn't know how to thank you," she added with a smile as she held my hand in hers. "That was kind of a surprise..."</p> <p>"It was nothing, I'm glad that I'm so nice to you. You are a very attractive young lady. You have a very sexy body; very appealing to the eye. If you like the job you'll do it very easy." We got to work, the contracts were signed and we headed out of the office.</p> <p>I'm not sure what day it was but it was definitely Tuesday. We left the office, gathered the contract and business cards in a safe deposit box and made our way to one of our favorite restaurants. A quick drink in the bar and we walked arm in arm to the table where our entrees were waiting.</p> <p>"You should order first before you order," I advised the waitress. I had ordered a grilled fish and I liked the way it tasted. I could already feel the stirrings of some cravings brewing in my stomach.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"You're going to get me in trouble if you go in with your hair tied up."</p> <p>"What about my hair? Do you really expect me to do anything with it after all those hours of work."</p> <p>"I didn't say that. Just promise me that the things I do for you don't include my hair." I could already see the wheels turning in her head.</p> <p>"You already know that," she said, "the trouble is that you can't say no without feeling uncomfortable with your hair being tied up, even if I say so myself."</p> <p>It made me really wet to hear that. The thought of what she was going to do to me made a knot in my stomach. A man always tells a woman that she makes them feel desired, especially if she's a woman.</p> <p>"I'll tell you what I'm going to do," I said to her as I took her wine glass and poured her some more. "The guy that I work with has a pretty small dick, too small to fit into my ass. I want you to get him in bed by the end of the week."</p> <p>She looked a little confused, "But I don't think the guys that I work with really like being penetrated there. You might be uncomfortable, we could get into it if we don't have sex."</p> <p>"The guy that I work with would never have an erection. He's a lucky guy to have the cock of someone that I know. I know that he could really get it up if he could get it up."</p> <p>"Well, the guy that I work with has a very small dick. And he really doesn't like it at all," she added with a sigh. "I mean I think that he just might end up being hurt if he's put his penis in me."</p> <p>"No, no not that, he's just saying that. I might actually do things that he wouldn't if he was wearing a condomâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
