And you...uh..." I trailed off trying to work out her name. The man had stopped talking. He didn't look around.</p> <p>"Hello?" he said again. We both looked up and saw some of the people walking past us, they were looking at us. That was weird, we hadn't noticed them at all before. It was like the first day we went out with each other.</p> <p>The man nodded as if we were just giving him something. "Hello, if it makes you feel any better I'm Carl." He looked around and smiled. "Are you ready to go?"</p> <p>I nodded as I was getting up from my kneeling position. I was a little nervous.</p> <p>I don't know how he got this lucky. He was definitely the stranger. I'd never even talked to him before.</p> <p>He gave me a short hug and went towards the door, then looked back at me. "You are doing very well with that one. You are learning a lot, don't worry, but that's the beauty of getting it done right." I gave him a nod in return and he was gone.</p> <p>As he closed and locked the door behind him I tried to stay still, I really did. He came up behind me and pulled down my skirt, over my panties, exposing my ass and pussy.</p> <p>"Let me take care of you with those," he said. He kissed me softly on the lips and pulled down my panties. "This will help you, but I will have to use something else." He went around and got under the cover of the bed and grabbed something off the wall.</p> <p>I don't know what happened, but I felt him bend me over and stuff his dick into my pussy.</p> <p>"Do you want me to stop?" he asked me.</p> <p>"Nope." I answered quietly.</p> <p>"Good. Now be a good girl and take care of her." He smiled as he said that.</p> <p>I knew what he was on about. I don't know what it is. I'm supposed to be obedient, so I'm getting pretty stupid.</p> <p>I don't know if I can do this, but I hope for the best. After all, this doesn't include anything but the best. I hope there was a chance of me losing everything or I was going to have this. It's not like the sex was anything special.</p> <p>After he pulled out of me I looked around at the other people that were walking past us. We could feel it. The smell of sex that was wafting around us.</p> <p>"Are you ready to go?" he asked, looking at me intently.</p> <p>"Yeah." I said and we grabbed our things and he walked with me.</p> <p>We got into the front seat of the limousine and he pulled me against his chest, kissing me. We started the car and he started the engine. I looked over at the front window and stared out. I couldn't believe what I was doing, but I didn't care I just thought about the man that just took my virginity. After that experience I decided that would be my life.</p> <p>I was determined to make sure that, if we were going to have sex, then I would do this. I would do everything he wanted. I just hoped we'd be able to go through that and never have to stop. I prayed with all my heart that we would.</p> <p>We started making it towards home and it felt better to be out and about and on my own than to be with one of the men I trusted.</p> <p>We took off in silence and headed down the road. Just like my experience with Sam earlier I was so excited and excited. This was so different, so different. I didn't believe it would feel like that again, but it was all I could think about.</p> <p>I don't know why, but I told myself I was his. I just knew I was going to have this. I wanted nothing more than to be his. No one would take notice of me and have sex with me again.</p> <p>There was nothing else in the world to think about, in that moment I wanted nothing more than to be his.</p> <p>It was getting very late when we got to the house. It felt like the first day we were ever apart. I didn't realize how much of a life this was going to be for me, I was so nervous and excited.</p> <p>The house was small, just like Sam's house on the other farm. I guess it was a ranch. I'm glad you live in town, it'll get a whole weekend. I guess you got the feeling we belong to each other. We're kind of different.</p> <p>He stopped at theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
