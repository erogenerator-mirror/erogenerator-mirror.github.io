She looked up at his eyes and saw his grin. "I am now going to finger you, while I keep playing with your pussy." She took the hand that she had been playing with and placed her fingers on her lips, and started to lick them. "No, No. No." He stopped her and she looked down at his hand still playing with her pussy. "Keep finger fucking yourself. Make yourself cum." He continued to play with her for a minute, before stopping and standing and moving away to begin to undress himself. She could not believe how he was behaving, she had never been this aroused in all her life, but here he was making her feel so sexy, just to hear him. His hand reached round her midsection and began playing with her clitoris, working it to full arousal.</p> <p>She could not believe the feeling it was causing, and she found she was starting to lose it, she was afraid he would try to come in to her, she was trying to catch her breath but he wasn't pushing it. He kept her there, and continued to play with her, making her desperate for her climax.</p> <p>"I am going to go now, and come in your pussy." He looked at her as had she, before he moved on the bed and got up. She saw he had a condom in his hand. He lay on his back on the bed and put the condom on her and she got up and got on her hands and knees, looking at him.</p> <p>"I love to watch you with a cock in you." She watched as he got up and started to pull on his condom and condom. She heard his breathing become more pronounced as she saw his hand move towards her pussy. His fingers got into her and he started to push himself into her, slowly pulling away and slamming himself into her. She could tell she was not able to take much more of this and started to moan uncontrollably, she had never had a sexual dream of herself doing something like this.</p> <p>He started to move faster and was now completely immersed in himself, and could feel his penis pushing against her cervix. She came. It was a strong orgasm in a beautiful kind of way. It wasn't real, but they had been talking about sex and she had thought this dream of him being in her. Then again, she realized, he had been dreaming of this for some time now, perhaps longer, and she was enjoying this. She could see how the condom slipped off easily as he went in and almost left completely out, she could not see, but she could feel him pushing in further and she was afraid. Finally he was all the way in her, and she could feel him going deep. He wanted to come now. She could feel it sliding over her cervix, and this time it didn't stop. She felt so wanted it. Her hand went to her mouth to stifle a scream as she came harder than she thought this man could, feeling him move in her as he came. His hips were moving just enough to be heard and felt and she felt his penis slide out of her again, as she looked up at him still in her orgasm. But now his penis was in, and she felt it touching her again.</p> <p>She felt him slowly begin to remove himself from her, and she heard the condom being opened. She put a finger in her mouth and smiled as he held his shaft to her wetness. He then started to kiss her. She felt her nipples being stroked as his hand stroked his manhood.</p> <p>"That's good. Your going to go real fast and strong." She got up on top of him as he kissed her as he began to move inside her. She was moving like she had never been before, but she was feeling very good. The feeling was building inside her as if she were being made. She pushed herself onto him as he grabbed onto her breasts and pulled her back into him and started to move slowly. She could feel the building sensations inside and found she could go very fast as this was what she had been wanting this man to do for so long. She was almost there and wanted him to go even faster. She was beginning to want him to come at any moment.</p> <p>Her finger was working her clitoris like she had been in front of him last night, just the thought of it and that feeling, and the feeling in her head, had her coming again. The feeling was building until, as soon as she was going to get off, she started to feel pressure, she knew he had started coming. The feeling inside, knowing he was about to come, as well as feeling the feeling of a man's pleasure inside her caused her orgasm to start. She thought, she had been this way for so long, thisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
