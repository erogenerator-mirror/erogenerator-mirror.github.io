I'm not exactly sure what those things are, though I'm sure they're pretty comfortable, but if I can, I'm probably going to be doing them for a few seconds at least!"</p> <p>I don't know if I could survive another one of these kinds of surprises tonight, but I didn't want to ruin her fun with her boyfriend's cum still in my mouth, anyway.</p> <p>"Oh, honey!"</p> <p>"What?" she asked.</p> <p>"Um, you never used a real cock before. I've never seen one except in porn..." I can only assume that's true, but I wanted to find out. I felt my cheeks grow even redder and blushed as I realized how long it felt like I actually had sucked off all the guys in my college.</p> <p>"Ah, I see you've never, like, done that. I'll try to remember to put my panties back on after I'm done."</p> <p>That didn't sound like a good time for "getting dressed", but I really did want to learn more about this girl!</p> <p>"Oh, so you're really into this then?"</p> <p>"A little, yeah... maybe I'll do it again sometime... sometime."</p> <p>"Oh, honey, you don't have to, like, do it to anyone else."</p> <p>She had a funny tone in her voice, which sounded really odd.</p> <p>"I'm sure it's something she doesn't do. She'll come to me and ask if I'm doing anything, and I'll tell her I'm cleaning your cum out of her pussy. And I can take my sweater off if you want me to."</p> <p>I could tell that we both liked the new look, and her eagerness was a little appealing, too. I could feel myself getting more turned on, too, and it turned even hotter still. "Um, maybe you should get to bed in the morning then."</p> <p>"I'm already up, honey, let's go get some breakfast."</p> <p>"I'd better go and change and get changed too."</p> <p>"Sure. I'll wait here for you when you wake up, if you want."</p> <p>I watched her walk back to the couch and sat down again. She was still wearing her panties, but she was already wearing a robe and only had a pair of slippers on her feet. She was looking up at me, and the look in her eyes told me that she was definitely not comfortable sleeping nude under the sheets. I think I started grinning, wondering how things would play out, especially when she walked back to her own bed, her robe still on the chair, and I was now standing in front of her in just my pajama bottoms and a shirt, wearing an even more ridiculous grin!</p> <p>"You look so beautiful and sexy, I don't think I've ever realized how gorgeous you really are. I guess I was wondering if you felt the same way about me. You were, like, totally in love with me the other night when I was sucking you off and you got hard again when I was sucking on you - you were standing in the bedroom with you in your pajamas, and I was sucking your cock - I thought I knew, like... you liked having sex with me, I can't tell the difference between a guy and a girl!"</p> <p>I was grinning, too, though, a bit surprised that I found this sexy, and then relieved that maybe we had a bit of a moment of intimacy.</p> <p>"Well, you can't tell whether I like being fucked, too, honey, and, you know, even more than you did with the guys..."</p> <p>I could hear her rummaging through her drawers as she talked, and I could feel her looking at my pajama top in a way that made me feel more vulnerable than I felt. I looked down at myself and she saw the pajama top sticking up on my hips. "You're not wearing a bra, anyway, are you? I can see the dark circles of your nipples through the fabric."</p> <p>"Yeah... um, not that much," I mumbled, my face blushing. It was so much easier to talk while standing in front of her, but that was part of what I'd always gotten used to.</p> <p>"You look a little like me?" she asked, her eyes on my face. I couldn't remember exactly what she had meant, but from the look on her face it seemed like she had been reading something else. "I think I'm pretty sure I'm a girl, too, and I know how much you like them big and soft between your lips."</p> <p>I was starting to really think about that, what she wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
