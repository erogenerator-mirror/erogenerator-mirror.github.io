"I feel as if I should at least have your hands on me right now."</p> <p>Kerri ran her nails lightly up his chest to his nipples. He shivered as she ran her fingernails down his chest and onto his flat, hard belly.</p> <p>'Did you really give yourself so much power over me, Sir?' she thought to herself as she traced his thick, muscular stomach with her fingernails; they were so soft and strong. "I've never been so turned on by someone before."</p> <p>"This is how I'd want you," she whispered seductively over his stomach, causing him to shudder with delight. "Just watch how hard my tongue will be...if I don't do my best...let me work on you."</p> <p>"No!" she gasped breathlessly, taking his hand and putting it on her left breast. "I'll take that," he grinned, sliding it up under her tank top. "It's been so long since I've had a woman on my skin; this will definitely do for you, honey."</p> <p>His hands slid up her sides to her breasts again, his fingers lightly pinching her nipples to a rigid state. Kerri sighed, rolling onto her back and lifting her knees and spreading them out.</p> <p>"My body will only work on your mouth," she smiled, pulling herself upwards. "And the hands?"</p> <p>"This is the way, honey," Teri sighed, kissing his lips before lifting up and sitting up to look down on her petite form. "You're going to love this, too."</p> <p>"You're a real beauty," was all Katerina could say as she got a good look at this young man. She lifted a leg on the side of the bed and sat between his legs, making sure that he was as hard as he could get now. "Oh, look at you..." she grinned as she slowly stroked his cock, loving how full and rigid it felt underneath her hand. "Look at how you've grown!" She teased, as she began stroking it, feeling it swelling in her hand. "It's going to be a long ride!" She let go of his cock as she got off the bed to lie her head and shoulders down against the mattress and take him into her mouth, just barely covering his head with her lips before opening her mouth and taking him inside. "A very long ride," she told her best friend, taking him back inside her mouth for a minute at the thought of taking all of him in one go.</p> <p>Kerri ran her nails up the side of Katerina's thighs. "That feels so good," she gasped. "I'm about to lose it and...I'm just going to...make it."</p> <p>"No, don't," Katerina replied in a daze. "You're not going to lose it to me. Go ahead and fuck me, baby."</p> <p>"Okay," Kerri gasped, feeling as if she might faint at that last word. "I'm about to, but that's all I need..." She reached out to hold onto Katerina's head, pulling it all the way down as she thrust it in and out of her mouth, getting a close up shot of her pretty, blonde head bobbing up and down on him as he continued to fuck her face. The combination of the visual and stimulation from her friend's beautiful lips and tongue was making her body go into overdrive, causing her pussy to moisten more rapidly. She ran her finger along her slit in a circular motion, feeling the warm skin of her thigh moving as she moved it up and down.</p> <p>"I wanna make this good," Katerina gasped, holding onto Kerri's hair as hard as she could.</p> <p>"You can take it, babe," Kerri smiled, kissing her neck.</p> <p>"I'm gonna...," she breathed, as the sensation continued to build in her pussy. "I'm so close!"</p> <p>Katerina felt as if her body had just been shot through the headboard, and started to back away as Kerri slid to get the position she wanted. Her mouth moved to Katerina's neck once more, kissing her as she kept stroking him and holding his hardness as she moved on herself. She could feel him tensing as her lips moved to her lover's skin and took him just inside her mouth.</p> <p>"Katerina...I'm so close!" Kerri moaned, loving the fact that Katerina was close to her at the moment, and loving every minute of it.</p> <p>"Let me fuck up here," she whispered, pulling her mouth off of his cock with a loud pop. "I wanna cum so bad." She moved her mouth down to kiss herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
