We're going to need food, a river, and some water, for a while."</p> <p>"Sounds good to me!" Then I said, "I thought we were going to have to stop at a campground for the afternoon?"</p> <p>"We are. Why bother? We've been here for a while and it's almost noon. We can walk or run a bit, but it's worth it if you can manage one thing."</p> <p>"Do you have any maps or anything?"</p> <p>"No, you make a great map. Why don't we call and set up for dinner?"</p> <p>We had our food prepared on my phone, and we walked to the camp site. There was a picnic table set up with food for the two of us, and a small fire was on in the middle and on the roof. We sat and began eating. The smell of coffee was still pleasant and the sight of the naked bodies and the sounds of sex were beginning to affect me. I wanted to do this, even if it meant a little physical stimulation and a lot of sex. I think I was still a little confused by the fact that I had made this decision to become a nudist, but the physical arousal of being naked in this place was making me horny too, and feeling the excitement of walking to the campground was having the same effect.</p> <p>"I like the idea of having some sex here," I said, "so do you."</p> <p>"I like it a lot. I like to be naked in places where people are not expected to be dressed to go. It's really nice and liberating, and I would have liked to make you naked. Would you like to help me with that?"</p> <p>"I would love to, and I guess I will." I was a little bit on the tip of my tongue right then, thinking 'Maybe I can do that without clothes on for a change?' But I also wanted to see how far we would go in a little place that would not have all of the sex stuff, but it also wouldn't be so seedy, and it would keep those kinds of feelings that I'd been suppressing and suppressed in my old life.</p> <p>I finished my coffee and said, "I have to go. Back to my place."</p> <p>We finished breakfast and made our way back to home. We were walking very slowly and talking and getting to know each other. My erection was showing for the first time. I wondered if I'd ever seen anything as erotic as the way she sat on me, and she smiled at me as she talked to me. When I turned around to take my towel, she looked at me, smiled at me, and then looked back at me and back at her phone, and back at her phone, and then looked at me again and then at the phone. When I turned around she smiled at me again.</p> <p>I don't know what comes next, but I just hold my arms open to her, just long enough so she can move in against me. When she reaches out and touches me, her fingers trace lines up and down my chest, across my stomach, and then up to my ear. She whispers in it, "Do you mind if I kiss you again?"</p> <p>"Not at all," I say, and she kisses me. Then she leans her body forward, and she kisses me very gently. When she moves back, she moves her body, and she moves back, and then moves a little and moves forward again.</p> <p>When she does kiss me again, she moves her body until both our bodies are in contact and she continues the kisses.</p> <p>When we're kissing, she moves her body so that her stomach is against my erection and she kisses me again. Then she moves so that she can place her body just behind my erection. She moves her body so that her breasts are pressing against me, and her body moves all around me. We are both in a lot of sexual stimulation, and I feel like I've been touching her. I know that she's getting turned on from kissing me. We continue kissing. When she moves her body again, she begins to move her hips against mine. She's so wet and her breasts rub up against me that I am feeling very aroused. She moves her hips so that they move down to caress my cock every few seconds. Then she moves her hips again to kiss up and down my chest and my stomach.</p> <p>And when we kiss, it's just soft kisses. We move our mouths, and we move our tongues. Then we kiss a little more passionately. When we kiss all over ourselves, we're really kissing. It's not just another slow, gentle kissâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
