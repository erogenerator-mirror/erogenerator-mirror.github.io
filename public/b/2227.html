I'd love to take you on an even longer journey, just to show how much I am capable of, but I've got to get to sleep first." After a slight pause for discussion, I spoke again. "Let's finish this up. I think we should take a stroll sometime before we have to put together our last dinner date." The next thing I knew we are standing on campus in front of the main entrance of Central Park, and the sound of crickets, frogs and the sound of the sound of rain crashing on the roof, I am wondering what the hell just happened.</p> <p>We took a seat on the bench and took our seats. As we were talking about how I was getting into my new job and how long I wanted to keep it, the sound of the rain had turned into a little lullaby. A lullaby with a hint of something different, and we were both so excited. At first I felt guilty about what had happened, until it hit me. I couldn't believe that this whole thing was happening, but I thought that now would be the perfect time to try to be with this person. As I looked out from the big window as the rain was hitting the horizon, I saw that a large shadow was descending from a tall tree. The shadow was not a blackness. It was just an outline. I wondered if it was going to be big or was just a shape, just for me to stand outside of my own shadow. The shadow moved closer and as closer it got, I saw that it was actually a black silhouette of a man. The shadow moved over my shoulder and across the front of my neck and chest. I could feel it moving lower as the silhouette moved across my shoulder and down my chest. I had to fight the desire to lean forward and hug it closer as I watched the shadow move across my body. The shadow continued down my chest to my waist, and as closer it got it went down the front of my thigh, down across my belly, finally crossing the fabric of the panties. The shadow ended on my cock, which was already getting hard. I was about to be in shock and horror, and yet couldn't help from leaning forward and putting my hands on the small of my back to try to hide what looked like a large stiff cock that was throbbing before my eyes. As I looked down and thought about the man standing between my legs, even more and more was my cock getting harder. The shadow returned to my lap and moved his legs between mine, which brought his cock down so that it was pressed against the front of my briefs, against that part of my body. It was a strange way to be so stiff as your cock grew in response, and I couldn't help but think of my own cock as an erection. "So you see the man is about the size of what yours is, and I don't think it will ever be that much bigger than what I have between my legs.' I thought.</p> <p>I sat there and thought while the shadow moved further up my lap. I could feel the outline of the shadow as the light came into the window, and I couldn't quite see how big the shadow was, but it was definitely large, and the shadow could move around quite a bit. I could feel a hand touch my face and I turned my face toward it and as my lips part into a small smile, I heard a very masculine voice telling me that it was ok, that nothing will happen.</p> <p>The shadow started to move up along my jaw to my neck and finally settled on my neck, where the shadow went all the way around to the top of my shoulder, and the shadow continued to move up to my ear. As the shadow moved up to my ear, I felt my mind being lifted from the shadow and then let out a loud whoop which was almost a sob. The fear of what the voice said next was so strong that I had no idea if it was my own fear or that this was a ghost.</p> <p>"Do tell the ghost." The voice that came from behind me said.</p> <p>It was not very high pitched, but it was clear the voice was quite deep and loud. As I felt his body next to me and realized that he was about the size of a large cat, or maybe an enormous bear. I could not see him as he leaned over me as his body was only inches from mine. As he got closer, I noticed that his body was almost twice the size of the man sitting next to me, which was a big difference. It was so wide that it was almost like that we were only three inches apart.</p> <p>The shadow next to me put his hand on my shoulder and told me to stay as still as I could. As much as I could't quite believe this, I was just wondering how much of it really was real. The shadow moved his hand from my shoulder down to myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
