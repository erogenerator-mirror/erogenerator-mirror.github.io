That was my excuse. I didn't have any idea what she meant.</p> <p>"So? I'm cool with letting you make me feel better!" I said.</p> <p>"I still have a job to do," she said, "so can we get out of here?"</p> <p>"I'd be happy to," I said, "but I'm afraid you're going to have to come in here and do this yourself."</p> <p>"But I'd love to," she smiled, "and to think that it was just some kind of trick."</p> <p>"No, that's the most wonderful way to describe it," I replied, "that it was a real magic trick. It had a power, and it was magical. I'll be happy to tell you about it later, of course."</p> <p>We parted. Alicia was still standing in the doorway as I walked out.</p> <p>"Well, we're done for the day!" I said, and Alicia smiled and gave me a friendly hug. I turned and started for the door and then stopped in my tracks. Alicia had been right. I just didn't have enough time to really pay attention to how Alicia was doing. It was going to take me a little bit to get over how much her magic was actually doing to me. It was just like she had mentioned, all right, but the magic wasn't really doing an overt thing. It certainly wasn't really helping the situation. I also decided that she should be going in there, and when she stepped out I was about to close the door a little because of the time it would take to get to the door. A better idea was to go in the bedroom and wait for her.</p> <p>"What are you waiting for?" Alicia called, and I knew that she was looking for me.</p> <p>I hesitated for a second, and then I moved over to the door and looked out. Alicia was standing between the beds. She was wearing a tiny little nighty that barely covered her. The tiny thing didn't do much except maybe accentuate her tiny breasts and show me more cleavage. It was only because I couldn't see any cleavage that it didn't just show more cleavage. And I wouldn't be able to see those breasts if she leaned over and put her arms around my neck and leaned her butt against me. Her body was gorgeous: slim, not overweight, but firm and shapely: very muscular, very smooth and sexy. I wanted to just run into her naked. I wanted to just run into her naked.</p> <p>I knew it was going to take me several seconds to get from that point when Alicia's arms slid around my neck and she pressed her lips up against mine. Her arms went around my neck and her hands came down to cup my boobs. Alicia pulled back slowly, teasing me by looking down at me with her lips on mine, and then she whispered in my ear, "Your new job won't finish for another hour and we have lots of time before we have to leave."</p> <p>"Aah," I said, "if I don't put a little extra effort on you already you'll have to come."</p> <p>I took Alicia's hands and lead her over to a bed, and then I knelt down and lifted her up, taking her onto the bed in one move.</p> <p>"Now lie down!" I instructed. As I pushed my way down the mattress Alicia climbed on top of me, and then she squatted over me, kissing me deeply as she rubbed her crotch against my pussy lips. She pulled back and gazed at me as a sly smile formed. I put my hands on her ass, and lifted her a little bit so that her crotch rested right on my crotch, and then she lifted herself so that my cock, already well lubricated with her pussy juices, nudged its way in.</p> <p>"Oh, God, yes!" she groaned, "so big!"</p> <p>And then she slowly lowered herself onto me, pressing her breasts against my chest and grinding her mound against me. Alicia's eyes were closed, and she was giving me the sexiest of smiles. Alicia kissed me and then started kissing my neck and my face, and then she moved her face up to be closer to mine as she began to rub her pussy against my cock and her breasts against my stomach through my clothes.</p> <p>"Oh, yes!" Alicia groaned from underneath me, "you feel so good!"</p> <p>The whole experience, for me, had taken me almost completely off the hook. I looked at Alicia's face to see that she was staring down at me, wide-eyed and smiling. She lowered her headâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
