I said, trying to distract her in her discomfort.</p> <p>"Mm.. ok... I don't feel good..." she panted. I smiled at her desperation and smiled again.</p> <p>I walked in her bedroom. I was happy to see the clothing laid out on her bed. I removed my clothes, laid them out and sat on her bed, and kissed her softly.</p> <p>She put her fingers in my hair and slowly removed my shirt and took off my shorts, before laying down next to me. I wrapped my arms around her again, and we laid there, kissing, slowly moving to touch and play a little. I found myself wanting her so much, I had to have her... to make her mine, not him. I moved my body up so I was on top of her and we were kissing again. I moved my hand and started to rub her breast.</p> <p>"Ohmygod.....I've wanted to do this with you so much..." she whispered, her breath shallow as our touching became more aggressive.</p> <p>I continued to squeeze her breasts, rolling and plucking her nipples. Lying down on top of her, I kissed her as my fingers touched her pussy gently.</p> <p>"Aahh..." she sighed, as my finger slid inside her slowly. I continued to finger her, pressing up against her. We became lost in the softness of a kiss and started to explore each other's body. I was aching to fuck her and she was mine. I pushed up into her as I held her breast, my fingers moving in and out in rhythm with her. I could feel her juices seeping out, I could feel her heart beating in rhythm with mine. I was feeling the same.</p> <p>I moved my fingers over her clit, flicking over it, squeezing down as I touched and felt her. I slid her finger inside of her as I continued to play with her like a toy. She started squirming, arching her back, as I slid my finger in and out, faster and faster. I kept it going, and soon she was moaning and gasping, but I kept on going. She was completely oblivious to her surroundings, we could hear the sounds of her and my moans.</p> <p>Suddenly, she screamed softly, almost incoherent as I felt her orgasm. Her hands ran up my back and pushed my head down towards hers. She moaned and writhed, pushing me down so I stayed on top of her, feeling her skin and breathing on mine as she came. I loved it. I kept my finger buried inside her and felt the muscles of her pussy contract around my finger as I pushed it in and out, her fingers digging into my back as she gasped out one more moan.</p> <p>"Mmm... that was nice..." she sighed. I could feel her chest heaving as she gasped.</p> <p>With another kiss we both lay there, both exhausted, both breathless.</p> <p>"Honey... I'm not sure... I guess we should leave... now." she whispered.</p> <p>I smiled and kissed her lips softly as we lay back on her bed, kissing, stroking and touching each other. For the rest of the night, we continued to make love as we caressed and rubbed her body in soft ways, exploring her body with our hands and lips. I continued to lay there at her side, my face still buried in her hair, kissing her neck. She pushed my face away and looked me in the eye.</p> <p>Her eyes were sad, and she started to cry a little. "Honey... will you promise me...." she started, almost out of breath. I smiled and gave her a hug. "Yes.. it's too late. I'll always love you... I'll always give myself to you, no matter how long it takes... I want to remember this day, for all our lives, as the happiest day of our lives..." She looked down at my body and then stared into my eyes, trying to read my heart. She didn't see any reason to say this, but I felt she needed to say it in the end, because I wanted it to be true. I held her tight and kissed her gently on her neck, feeling her tears. "I can't tell you. I want to always love you, all of you, just as any of us. If that means I stay with you, then..." she replied.</p> <p>"Honey... please don't say no. You're the best thing that's ever happened to you." I felt so happy for her, and also for me. I had to take that hard to her again.</p> <p>After we were finally able to get away, we went homeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
