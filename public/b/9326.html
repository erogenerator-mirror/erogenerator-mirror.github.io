I said in response to her comment. Then she gave a little chuckle and stood. "But you know I don't like to take advantage here...or you have to do the same, don't you?"</p> <p>"Hmm!" I said, not being entirely sure about this. "I've heard some girls say, 'you can't be serious!'. I can't. They'd be very embarrassed." I then quickly added, "You know the difference between a 'no sex' girl and a 'really' girl. The two work very differently and often you'll get caught!" Her expression immediately changed to what I thought I would be used to seeing; a little smile playing on her teeth.</p> <p>"Well, how would you like to experience the other way around? I can't wait to see how it will feel!" she said. "I have a surprise for you!"</p> <p>I opened the door to my apartment about 15 minutes later, still somewhat stunned at what she had said. The main room was like it usually was; with only a single king sized bed facing the street and the floor on opposite sides facing north and east as it faced east. Our bedroom was just at the end of the room, so if you were to go around the left side and turn right into the bed you would have a normal sized bed with no furniture and a big screen TV set on the left side of the room and probably a TV set on the top of the wall behind a mirror. This was perfect if one had to use the bathroom. I also had a large flat stone fireplace located on the right side of the room that was located only about 30. This was our room since it was off to their left. This was still a nice arrangement and the view was perfect for a relaxing night or two. The small bathroom and two separate showers on the other side of the room also had a bathtub on the left side.</p> <p>Her surprise was not going to last so easily. She came back in the door just after I finished opening and closing the door and locked it. She was standing between my legs with her chin resting on my thigh, her hand resting gently on my thigh as she leaned in, kissed me very suggestively and then dropped her right hand onto my cock. I responded in kind by putting my left hand on top of hers, but she quickly pulled it away and then pressed it down on my stomach again and then looked up into my eyes.</p> <p>"It's okay," I said. She smiled and nodded as she moved the hand away from my stomach, lifted my right leg and wrapped it securely around her waist, which brought her lips to mine immediately. As I kissed her it was so different; we were both ready to take action.</p> <p>After a minute I broke the kiss, "Now. It's me or the game?" I suggested, breaking the kiss and reaching over her shoulder to turn the lamp on in the night table.</p> <p>"Oh, really?" she sighed as she turned her head to make sure the room wasn't dim enough before starting to remove the top of her blouse. "Well, what a shame," she muttered and then reached back and pulled off her top so that I could take the same chance I had taken on her. By the way her breasts were bouncing with the motion of her hands she really knew just how to move. I didn't mind the view as she pulled a sports bra off and tossed it to the side, then reached back and undid the clasp of her skirt and slowly drew it off. She stepped back and slipped the skirt off before turning around and pushing it down her calves and then her feet.</p> <p>"Wow!" I said as I looked at her perfect breasts in profile. She was wearing a white lace bra that barely contained them and barely covered her nipples. Her nipples were standing up like a pencil eraser and were at least a half inch long.</p> <p>"You like?" she asked as she looked me over. "Well, they still look good to me..." she added with a bit of a smile. I could just see the tip of my hard cock poking through the thin material on top of my boxers. I had expected her to get a hug or maybe even kiss me as she came forward, but I was wrong, instead she slipped her arms through the straps of the bra and reached around and unhooked it from her breasts, tossing it on the bed behind me. She then ran her hands up and down her beautiful legs before leaning back and pulling her panties off slowly before turning around and running the skirt off her body as well.</p> <p>I immediately was in the state of the sexual arousal of seeing these two, in full nakedness, just as I had. As her hands began to slide over her tight little ass I couldn't wait to get my cock in her so I could penetrate her, but I also had to wait as far as possible so that the moment didn'tâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
