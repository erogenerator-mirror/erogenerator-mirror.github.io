He was going to take a nap by letting the coffee get hot and then he could eat while his body was in control.</p> <p>-3-</p> <p>He woke to something coming from the other bedroom. He got up to make sure he had time to check the other room. The light was still on, and a light that he thought would be blue and yellow was in his right elbow. He sat and looked a bit at himself.</p> <p>"Holy shit, what happened?" The light came on and there she was, his sexy wife. He wanted to get up and run back out to him and show her how good of a husband she had. He hadn't even looked at the sheets and didn't even know she had fallen asleep. The first thing he had seen all night was that little smile that you get when you know it was going on, but it didn't seem like a smile this little one was so happy. When he moved his head sideways to look at her face he noticed the little dimples.</p> <p>"I'm sorry to wake you up there," he said.</p> <p>"Mmmm... You were so good to me this morning." she said back that little smile again.</p> <p>"So I see now," he said. "What did you have in mind by the way."</p> <p>"I just thought you were going to help me get this place up to use it."</p> <p>"Yes, and I think you already did."</p> <p>"Not quite the way I hoped you would."</p> <p>She reached down and began undoing her pajamas. The little blue fabric fell to the floor. She opened the bedclothes drawer and took out a red nightie.</p> <p>"Is that what you wanted to see?" she asked.</p> <p>"That depends," he replied. "What makes me think that you wanted me here instead of just being out of town?"</p> <p>"It's hard on a little guy, to look at me this way, but I guess that a part of me likes doing it."</p> <p>"You'll always get what you need," he offered with a smile. "Here, let me do that for you."</p> <p>She sat down on the side of the bed and slid her panties off. She began spreading herself and she knew there was no harm in that. She reached between her legs with her finger and touched herself for a few seconds.</p> <p>"I could use a little work, but..."</p> <p>"Do it," he said. "That's what I've been doing to my body all this time."</p> <p>She put her finger to her lips and bit it.</p> <p>"Maybe later. Right now," he added. "You don't need to talk any more."</p> <p>He leaned closer and put his face in her arms. He kissed her lightly.</p> <p>She laid back and said, "Let's get him ready now and just let me wash my pussy all over, and then we can go."</p> <p>He got on the bed and began to remove his clothes and then his. She moved around and knelt down on the bed. He stood up and she put his penis between her legs, which caused the tip to rub her lips. He had never really had the opportunity to do it this way, but it had seemed like a natural progression.</p> <p>He placed his hands on her hips and pulled her close. He could tell she was already getting excited, but she didn't seem to mind too much. He put his fingers into her. She was wet and hot and her body moved with his. His erection pushed against her and she pushed against it. His penis, well endowed and very hard, pressed against her. She put her arms around his neck.</p> <p>They kissed, and as they kissed he ran his penis between her lips and up her stomach. It felt so good to him, and she kissed him back. He moved the base of his penis in the middle of her bellybutton. It slid over her lower stomach and she let out a little moan. He took his penis back in his hand and began to move it up and down over her labia in a circular motion.</p> <p>"That feels so good," he said. "I love how you move all over me."</p> <p>Her eyes opened wide, but she did her best to not smile.</p> <p>He picked up the tempo, and in a few moments she began to moan even louder.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck, now!" she said again and then her hips rose and fell against his.</p> <p>He put his hands down on her hips and helped her to her feet. He wrapped them around her waist, and held her body up.
