She was still on her back facing me, and as I approached her I could not help but run my fingers over her bare breasts, teasing and touching them as I did so, until suddenly she reached out, grabbed my shoulders and shook me. "No!" I shook her as she turned her head and screamed, "No!" and tried to press herself back against me. I stopped suddenly and was surprised as she tried to pull away. "No" I said firmly and pushed her back.</p> <p>Looking up into her eyes I said "I know you. I feel that. I do, and I want you." I grabbed her legs and rolled them back up to her shoulders and pressed the head of my cock firmly against her tight little asshole. She shook her head, and I pulled it back, only to push it deeply back inside. "NO!" She said again and then tried to buck back and force herself back onto me, but I just looked at her and smiled. She screamed again and tried reaching for me, only to lose herself in the feel of my body as I fucked her in that spot.</p> <p>Her cries of ecstasy filling the room, I took my hands away from her, and looked down at her. "You ready, sweetheart?" I said softly, and she nodded. She seemed reluctant to try it again, but as I pressed myself hard against her asshole and thrust myself in and out of her, one look on her face just confirmed my suspicions. She was tight.

I had thought I had not been able to, but still felt that I was still deep inside her, as deep as I could go, and I pulled out as I went back in, making sure that I could come as deep in her body as I could. After that, we were still locked together as I fell on her and her legs went round her head as I pulled myself out of her and held myself in front of her again, still smiling. She looked up at me. "You bastard!" She yelled and I laughed.</p> <p>"Are you okay, sweetheart?" I said, and she just shook her head, not looking at whether or not her words had made me angry. I had no idea how long we held this position and I really knew that no matter what happened I had a strong desire to punish her and make her my, but there was enough time before we had to go and I had already got a good hold on a few things. I started to laugh. "Okay." I said and took a step back. "I think we both need another drink."</p> <p>She looked at me a little surprised at that. "Yes," she said and took a sip at the same time, and then asked "Would you like one too, Master?"</p> <p>"No, I think we're ready for another drink."</p> <p>She took another sip at my order and I saw her swallow as she looked at my still partially hard cock, and then leaned forward a little. "Thank you, Masterâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
