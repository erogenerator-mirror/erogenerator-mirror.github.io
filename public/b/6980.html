She was hot and she wanted him, they could lie there for hours, kissing, touching, kissing and exploring each other’s body, but she didn't want to rush things. He was gentle in his kisses and she felt his hard cock pressing against her thigh as he continued his exploration. He moved his mouth back down to her breast, sucking it gently and then sucking her nipples as he took his mouth from her.</p> <p>When his lips left her breast she moaned and arched her hips, seeking him to take her, her body aching. As his fingers reached out to take over her breast, she felt something soft and smooth as it touched her, but then stopped immediately as he touched her. With her heart racing, she held his hand tightly, looking at him pleadingly, her eyes widening with fright as he continued to rub her.</p> <p>He smiled as he felt her tense against him. "I'm sure you've forgotten that you're supposed to be giving me a choice," his voice was gentle, yet strong as he stroked her body, holding himself above her. "I could give you a lot of pleasure."</p> <p>He continued to look at her as he moved a little closer, then reached for the light. When he turned the light on he looked at her. "You're so beautiful," he whispered in her ear, kissing the nape of her neck a moment later. With that, he lowered his lips to her neck once more as his fingers traced the tip of her breast.</p> <p>"Yes, yes ... " She breathed, her eyes closing as he touched her in the most intimate places and he knew she was dying to go further. "Oh yes. Yes," she whispered. And then she was biting her bottom lip in a sign of arousal.</p> <p>"Oh, God yes," he replied. "I've wanted you to love me since I last saw you," the words coming out a little faster when he brushed her, aching to have her in his arms, "so very much."</p> <p>Gasping as he continued, "You are the most beautiful girl I have ever seen, Rachel."</p> <p>She gasped as he moved his finger from her to her nipple and began to twist. "Oh God," she moaned. "Oh yes," she whispered his name over and over, feeling her pulse rise in her chest, feeling her need for his touch deepen.</p> <p>"I am going to make you do as I told you." His fingers pinched her nipple lightly but firmly. "And I'm going to show you that I can be very, very, good with it and it will mean everything."</p> <p>His fingers continued to press her and she moaned in response to the gentle pressure, moving her hips up against him. He moved her head so she could take a look at his body as best she could, her mouth moving over the skin he was caressing until he took both nipples into his fingers and flicked each with his tongue. His fingers tightened on her nipples, making her cry out and she thrust her body toward him, wanting him inside her.</p> <p>He took her head in his hands and pushed her toward his mouth. "Stick your hand down," he said in a stern voice. "And look at me while I do this."</p> <p>Taking his place between her legs, he looked up into her eyes. "I won't touch you while you're like this." And he pulled her hips back. "Look at me and do it. That's a good girl," he purred and she looked down at his fingers again as they worked on her.</p> <p>All the feelings of guilt and fear were suddenly replaced by the feel of excitement and the excitement of knowing that she would not refuse him, that she would not object to this. She pulled his head toward her and gasped as his tongue met her, lapping at her lips. "Yes," she cried out, arching up. "This is lovely."</p> <p>He held his hand and pushed her legs open wider, knowing that she had no idea how to feel this. "Do you think you can cum again?" he asked as he moved on top of her body, his lips coming down to kiss her again.</p> <p>She pushed herself down onto him, feeling his lips against her skin as she wrapped her legs over him and kissed him. "I could still refuse you ... oh—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
