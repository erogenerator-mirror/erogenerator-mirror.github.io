She looked up at him.</p> <p>"Please what?"</p> <p>"I need you inside me."</p> <p>"Where?"</p> <p>"Over that table in front of you." She grabbed a chair from the desk.</p> <p>He walked towards the desk and sat down. She walked over there and sat down over his lap. She kissed him. Then moved slowly in kissing him. Their tongues slowly made their way through each other's lips. They pulled each other closer.</p> <p>He grabbed her shirt with one hand and she reached up with the other hand. He kissed her stomach until she unbuttoned his tie and unzipped his jeans. When she pulled down his pants she looked at his cock, which was now standing up proudly. She leaned forward and began to lick the head.</p> <p>"Oh yes. Kiss me."</p> <p>Theresa gently began kissing his cock as she slowly inserted him into her mouth. She slowly swallowed his whole 9" cock. It felt like heaven, she felt like she lived in a fairy tale. The feel of him inside her mouth was so good she didn't want it to end, but it didn't. As she slowly slid his cock in and out of her mouth it was like it never went down.</p> <p>"Yes." He moaned softly. "Yes. Take it all."</p> <p>She smiled. She loved it!</p> <p>"Your cock feels so good. I do need you inside me."</p> <p>"As much as I need you." He replied. "I'll be happy whenever you bring that thing inside me."</p> <p>She began kissing him until he pulled her back, so they were lying on his desk. She slid her shorts down her legs and started to play with his cock head. By the time she was done, it was so hard.</p> <p>"Please." She pleaded.</p> <p>He grabbed her ass and pulled her closer and pulled her towards him. He began to pull his cock out of her mouth, while she wrapped the other hand around his cock. He pushed her down on her back.</p> <p>"Fuck me hard." He demanded, kissing her breast and teasing her nipple with his tongue as her hands started kneading his muscular butt. His balls had turned a darker shade of dark brown now. "I need it inside me."</p> <p>He got up slightly and positioned his cock at her entrance and pushed inside. It felt fantastic and every inch that enters her felt amazing. Theresa looked into his eyes, and saw that there was no arguing. She was definitely his.</p> <p>He began to slowly pump inside of her. They were moaning as he filled up in her. He began to piston away inside of her, making it clear that he wasn't going to last much longer. When she reached down and rubbed his clit, he was already cumming.</p> <p>"Ahhh yes! Yes! Yes."</p> <p>His body shuddered as he shot his hot load deep inside her. When his cock finally stopped throbbing, theresa climbed up him and licked the cum off of his neck. He put his head back and hugged her again. They fell onto the floor. Theresa looked into his eyes and slowly began to kiss his lips again. "Now let's do this again." She said with another smile.</p> <p>She gave him a passionate kiss and ran her hands through his hair. "I just want to see you againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
