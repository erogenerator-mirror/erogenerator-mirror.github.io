The taste of his cock was sweet and I lapped at his lips. He moaned and lifted his head. We locked eyes as I rose up his cock, then slowly descended on it, letting it plow deeper into my mouth. I was moving my hips and he moaned. "Ohhhhhh...my god," my body shuddered. He took my nipple in his mouth, his hands kneading on them, while he pinched a nipple to create pleasure in the area between my legs. I moaned around his cock that I was loving it. I wanted more. "I can tell you like this too."</p> <p>"Yessss... I love you...now..." My mouth fell off his and we kissed. His hands were on my hips, pulling me upward. I was so hot and wet and eager for his cock. I rocked my hips and felt him slide deep into me. The friction was amazing and soon I felt his pubic hairs against my skin. He was thrusting into me, slowly and firmly. The pain of his initial violation overwhelmed me and I was in ecstasy. "Oh god," I mewed, "please fuck me..." I didn't care if his cock was buried in my pussy. I had to cum. I had to cum quickly. I lifted myself on my knees and began bouncing up and down, his hands on my hips, my breasts bouncing up and down on my chest. He kept thrusting into me faster and harder, bringing me closer to the edge. "I'm going to cum," I gasped. My pussy was throbbing and wet, the juices had been running down my thigh.</p> <p>"Not yet," he said, "cum with me."</p> <p>I rose back to his cock and leaned forward to kiss him. His hands were on my shoulders, his fingers digging into my flesh. "I love you so much."</p> <p>"I love you too," I moaned; his cum was dripping onto my thighs. After I kissed him I began to rise. He pushed my backwards, leaving long strands of spunk hanging from my chin. "I'm going to cum."</p> <p>"Just one more stroke," I said, and I moved over his cock until I felt my pussy open and my lips touch it. The head was soft and the shaft was hard as rock against my lips. I sank down slowly, taking the entire length in. I moaned, the sound of his cock as it slid into me filled the room. I felt like my pussy could never get fucked again. I moaned as I began to grind on his cock. As I rocked forward he grabbed my legs and held them up in the air, using the leverage to fuck me and fuck me. I groaned, feeling every inch of him inside me as he bottomed out. I was going crazy.</p> <p>"Oh god," I cried out as he held on to my bouncing tits with both hands. We were grinding ourselves against each other as we moved in unison; faster and faster. "I love you," I panted in his ear, I felt his cock swell and knew he was going to cum. "Oh fuck; you're good." I knew I could feel his cock expand inside me; he was so hard. "Cumming" I screamed. He grabbed my hips as his cock exploded.</p> <p>"Oh my god," he breathed into my ear, "what have I done?" His cock pulsed again and a moment later it was back inside me. It was a different sensation than when we used to have sex. My pussy contracted around him as I felt the last remnants of his cum escape me and coat his cock. When he released my shoulders, I sat up straight and kissed him. His cum still dripped onto my lips as we kissed. I was still on my knees, I moved to sit on his lap, but he slapped my ass, reminding me we had to clean up before they were to go. I raised myself off his lap and he stood up, then I was on my knees before him, his hands on my shoulders, kissing me, and licking his seed from my chin and neck. My tongue traced the trail all the way down to his chest.</p> <p>"I missed you."</p> <p>"I missed you too," I added.</p> <p>"That means we have to finish this right," he said. He pulled his pants back and zipped them. "What do I have to do to get to the room before it's open again?" he asked playfully.</p> <p>"You have the choice," I replied, "if you like. Or I can just fuck your brains out againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
