"I think I could really make a few good comments here. Can I help turn her around, man?"</p> <p>"Oh, man, yeah, sure. Sure!" I quickly ran to the table to put the empty glasses on the table and then to my room.</p> <p>"Here, let me take a minute and see if I can help." As I ran to the table the men started talking. "So what's your name, you look familiar but it looks like you aren't really the man that you say you were. I can't see a thing!"</p> <p>"I'm Bill."</p> <p>"Ahhh, how did you know my name?" She looked at me with wide eyed amazement on her face. "I was just the girl that you called you. I just knew that you were a little more than a man," she said as she picked up and handed me a glass of wine.</p> <p>"I'm not your man, you silly!" I exclaimed as I downed the alcohol. "This is your party, aren't you right?"</p> <p>"I'm all yours, sweetheart," she said with a smile as she reached out and ran her hand over my ass.</p> <p>We chatted for like two minutes and then he said. "Well then I would love to kiss the hell out of you. I have been a little busy tonight." I smiled at that comment.</p> <p>"I didn't mean to be a little busy!"</p> <p>She got nervous. "You really should have come sooner." Then she said. "I have some things to do today but we could have a party. Let me grab my purse and go out for a couple of coolers before going to work."</p> <p>"Honey, I'm not going to go with you. There are a lot of things that I have to work out with you." I couldn't argue with that and besides, the two of them had already made plans for me to return to my flat.</p> <p>"Oh, so you are going with me?"</p> <p>"I guess you could call it that," she giggled.</p> <p>We continued to talk and sip our wine as she stood and offered me her hand to help me up. I was still on my feet, but was a bit shaky and I wobbled a bit because she had helped me up first.</p> <p>Once we got the table to the front and we were seated together, I turned to face her. "So you work with your guys?"</p> <p>She turned to me. "Yes, they are from California now and they own a farm here. So it wasn't just a nice little restaurant either," she finished.</p> <p>"So you live here also. You have two bedrooms and a single bathroom down on the right."</p> <p>"I do," she answered. "It's quite a house though."</p> <p>"Well it's certainly got some nice rooms on it but I live here. We like to have the living room and kitchen to ourselves. We got some good old-fashioned furniture here too, so I had a set of cabinets up with all of the kitchen and a kitchen for the bathroom."</p> <p>"Wow, nice! We all live here!" she replied excitedly. "I hope we can bring the guys to work out some stuff."</p> <p>I didn't say a word, but stood up and gave her a hug and a quick kiss on the cheek. By "work out some stuff", I mean some stuff, and a lot of work is hard, but having a two person house has its advantages. With me, everything has its advantages. I am more or less a part time consultant when I am working with our guys but now I am able to run the place myself. I also have a couple of new clothes that I bought out of our old place.</p> <p>When we got home the next day, the guys were sitting in the living room as we were setting the table. They were sitting in their usual chairs with their backs to me and I was talking to a pair of very friendly guys. My new roommates looked at me and smiled. They came up behind me and put their hands on my bare legs. I was about to protest but then I felt a pair of hands running up a length of my legs and caressing my ass again. I felt the hardness of a cock against my bottom and turned to see what was happening. The next thing I know, the guy in the other leg was running the tip of his cock up and down my slit. I was so caught up in the sensations that I didn't realize what he was doing until he quickly slipped his cock between my legs and I felt it press hard into me. It felt as hard as a steel rod and I tried to move away, but the guy grabbed my hands and pulled them back toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
