Now, though, she had just been unable to concentrate on anything other than her own thoughts or her own feelings.</p> <p>She slowly closed her eyes, trying to read my thoughts. She made a face, then opened them. She saw that she was surrounded by thoughts that she had never known, and began to panic.</p> <p>"Diana!" she thought, "You can't see me!"</p> <p>She took a quick survey of the room, and realized that it had gone in a different direction than she had imagined. She looked around her room, trying to see some kind of sign of her surroundings, and was horrified with how different everything looked. Everything she had seen was so much better than she had imagined when she entered her room to start her life.</p> <p>She was still trying to come up with her bearings, but there was no way she was going to get out of this. She ran into the bathroom, and closed the door quickly. Then she looked around the room as if she hadn't just been attacked by aliens on TV, or some weird dream. She saw a large desk with a variety of things on it, and thought how appropriate to sit that instead of the large armchair. Then she closed the bathroom door behind her and tried to make herself as comfortable as she could.</p> <p>Then she took several deep breaths and began to come to her senses. She had been so wrapped up in her own thoughts that she had not started to hear the door open. Then she turned around to say, "Oh, my God!" But only for a second. Then she realized that she was completely alone in her room, and was standing in front of the closet, which now had several different clothes hanging in it. And it wasn't that she had been afraid of being discovered, it was that there were no clothes on the bottom shelf of her closet.</p> <p>She turned to look at her phone and realized that she could not find the button to the lock so she had to press it. She turned around suddenly, her face red and breath in and nostrils flaring.</p> <p>"Oh," she said, feeling as if she had just run a wet wash cloth across her face. "No. It's my closet! I can't really find it..." She didn't know what to say. What could she say? How could she possibly explain the fact that she could actually find the key to her mother's room in the first place without finding the other side of the glass in the closet?</p> <p>"You've never done this before." she thought. "No other girl has done this for me in as long as I've known you." The thought occurred to her that she probably shouldn't be thinking such a thing, but she didn't know herself at all but she certainly had never looked at porn. "I would never have thought of having such a pretty room, but I guess you have got to be kidding. Do you have a secret, Diana?" she asked in the next voice.</p> <p>"You're not kidding, aren't you?" she thought, and with no hesitation did so. "Do I have a secret?" she said again. "Do I have a secret!" she said. "Yes! My secret!" she said in complete conviction.</p> <p>"Well, now you have got to be really specific here!" she thought. She sat down on the edge of the bed. "I got this hidden so my mother would not find it," she thought. "And now I have to say it. My secret!" She began to pull and lift her bra straps, and then she began to pull them away. "Now my bra is off!" she said out loud, and began to reach behind her to release her brassiere. When she had it unfastened, she slipped it off, and then reached behind her back to undress herself. She felt as if she was looking at the ceiling, and this was the only time that her thoughts could be completely clear. "But what am I doing?" she wondered.</p> <p>She turned around looking down at herself and saw that she did indeed have a gorgeous body. Her breasts were a little above medium size, and her waist was trim. Her long legs came right up to her knees and were made of very soft, supple flesh. She looked down at her ass. The cheeks that she had never seen before were firm and well formed, and they seemed to glisten with lotion. Her ass was round, and it jiggled whenever she moved. She lifted her head up to see if anyone in the room could see her, and she could see all of the windows. She looked into the living room. Her eyes widened in surprise and excitement. "Oh, my God!" she thought. "It's so beautiful! What's happening here?"</p> <p>She tried to look around the room again, but she couldn't.
