She reached up to touch my nipples again, then traced a line from one aureole to the other with her fingers.</p> <p>"Mmm...that feels very, very good," I managed to gasp between my moans, as my pussy responded to her touch and her probing of my nipples with lustful abandon.</p> <p>Slowly she brought her finger up to me lips, and I parted them as I sucked her finger into my mouth...</p> <p>"Ooh, aaahhh..." I gasped.</p> <p>"Yes!" she responded.</p> <p>And with that, my second finger was driven into me...all the way...my pussy clamped around her finger as I came, gushing my juices all over...my fingers entwined and digging into the mattress as I came down from my climactic high...</p> <p>Her fingers were not there, but she was still playing with me, slowly and deliberately...one hand moving in gentle circles over both my breasts and nipples...</p> <p>I was in a post-orgasmic haze as she continued to rub my breasts and nipples, her mouth kissing and nibbling my flesh...</p> <p>Her fingers were still working inside and they were still in an intimate embrace as she drew me down into a deep, languorous kiss...</p> <p>"God..." I moaned, "I love you..."</p> <p>"I love you too," she said.</p> <p>Chapter 7.</p> <p>I must have awakened sometime on the next morning, and I was still lying naked in bed, my hand resting on my pussy...it felt wonderful...but there were other things, other pleasures, and there was nothing I wanted to do.</p> <p>I got up and went to the bathroom...nothing but the warm steaming water in the shower.</p> <p>I washed myself from head to toe...my body feeling a little sore from my activities, but it was nothing really. I thought it would feel better in bed...</p> <p>So this morning, as I was toweling from the shower, my pussy was again open to the world. I felt like a new young woman, enjoying the sensuous pleasures of a sensuous life with a mature woman. She'd probably felt what I'd been feeling in the bedroom last night, but she didn't seem like someone who was in a hurry to have something that she didn't take home to a real mother.</p> <p>I felt a little strange having the thought of my mother today, and suddenly felt aroused by it as her body was so close to me. I looked at my body...I wondered if she was as good a woman-cat as she'd been. I'd long thought she was too...but I was not about to tell her just yet, even if what had happened this morning was a bit off...even if she wanted her own pleasure today at the moment.</p> <p>I dried myself off, and wrapped myself with a large towel...I wanted to wear something sexy for her today, but I knew that it was only fitting, that she'd be able to accept all the things I'd done in the shower. I made sure there were little surprises to be found...</p> <p>But before I left she was still in bed, reading, so I thought it was a good time to get to know her, to see whether we'd be able to get together this year.</p> <p>"Hi there!" I said, as I walked past her on the way. "How do you know my name?"</p> <p>"I'm Jenny," she replied. "And you're my son?"</p> <p>"My name is James," I said simply.</p> <p>I think she looked a bit nervous as she handed me my clothes from the bed, but she managed to hold on to the towel, because she felt more confident in holding the dress in, but not her own. There was more than enough clothes for a dozen in my wardrobe, I decided, if she wanted them so much that her dress was more than respectable. And it was too late now. I was looking at her with something like a lover's gaze, and it was a look that spoke to her own inner lust and desire...</p> <p>"How come you aren't here now?" she asked.</p> <p>I took the dress from her hand.</p> <p>"So I'm still here," I replied, "and here I'm having the most erotic experience of my life!"</p> <p>"You weren't supposed to be here!" she protested. "But then, you never have to stay away from me after I've had such a good time!"</p> <p>"True," I said. I felt a little uncomfortable with her trying to be a lover all the same.
