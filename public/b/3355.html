It is what I must. I will be pleased - with just one thought."</p> <p>I nodded, still breathing deeply now, and nodded again in response. He moved to the middle of the bed and then sat with his legs between mine.</p> <p>"We need a drink, I think." He put a glass of wine in both of our hands, taking my hand and placing it gently on his lap. I moved closer to him, placing mine on his crotch, his penis pressing against my lower stomach.</p> <p>"I want to give you pleasure," His eyes were closed and he started to smile. "I'll be very good, but it will be hard. What would you give me if I gave you pleasure?"</p> <p>"What would it be?" I asked. "I want to know." I rubbed him gently with my hand. It was so large, I was afraid it might rip me. "Please?" He lifted one of my hands and placed it between his legs.</p> <p>"Hush. I won't hurt you. Please enjoy me when you can enjoy me, not when you can't. Just be yourself. Do you really believe that you're that good?" He didn't answer for a long moment, just allowing my hand to do all the talking. "And I guess you think I'm that good - do you really believe that? I mean – it's not that bad a promise."</p> <p></p> <p>My first taste of his penis and his taste of his cum was different, much fresher than I had anticipated, even though I'd tasted myself on occasion during one of our sessions, and I was not surprised to find that his cock was longer and thicker then mine. I took it in my mouth and swirled my tongue around it, trying to get it as much in as I could, feeling it slide in and out of my mouth. I took it down my throat and made him moan. Finally I reached my hand up and gently stroked the small of his back, trying to urge him to start moving his hips. His breathing got deeper now, and a wave of pleasure swept over me. He shifted his hands from my head and moved them up my sides, finally reaching the top of my breasts.</p> <p>"It's not as big as you, but it's still very nice," he whispered. "It's been awhile since I've tasted you. Do you want me to make you feel good?"</p> <p>"No. No -- I want to get pleasure. You are so good to me. I want to make it good - and not to hurt you." He slid his fingers between my breasts to feel the softness of them, and then moved them up to pinch and tease my now rock-hard nipples. They stood high on my breasts and they were long and hard. It took a moment for my breathing to start returning to normal.</p> <p>He lifted his head to look at me. "Do you know how much this means to my feelings? That you want this? The love I feel for you? The love I have for you? It's like knowing that your husband - your partner I mean - isn't so good for me." He smiled down at me. "I understand. You're a very special, special woman, and I will never hurt you in any way. Please, do it for me, please."</p> <p>"If I get pleasure like this - at either the company or the club - maybe I can get pleasure with other men." I felt a little silly. He made a half joke in that way. But the words were true. In my mind the words made me feel even sexier, stronger, sexier. If I would let him make love to me; then I would let him make love to me. As my hand worked under his, I heard his voice, soft and steady, and I realized he was speaking me like a person; like an emotional woman-child-</p> <p>When the thought penetrated me, I could not stop myself. I had never imagined the kind of relationship a relationship, of lovers - of love would have - but I found myself unable to refuse this, no matter what the cost, no matter how much pleasure each of our bodies could bring.</p> <p>"I'll suck your cock until you come," I whispered. "I'll drink your juice until you come." When he felt the first twinges in me, he began moving. It was the most amazing feeling, and the one of the strongest I had ever known.</p> <p>I wanted to take him in my mouth. There is no need, no reason to hold back. I wanted to feel him slide in and out of my mouth with a feeling of freedom, feeling his hard cockhead pressed against the back of my throat. I wanted to have him come in my mouth before I allowed him to enter me—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
