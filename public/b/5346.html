I still worry I'm too old to be still in charge. That will happen sooner rather than later and I hope you understand. So, if you think you feel it, just say the word and I'll come out, okay?</p> <p>You will be on probation, okay?</p> <p>I just want you to see you, to be part of your life and I want you to know this will be the start of something great and amazing. If you don't remember, this is the start of something wonderful and amazing.</p> <p>-Sonia</p> <p></p> <p>*</p> <p></p> <p>The day I went to school is just getting closer. I have a lot to learn about how life works. I do have my parents, some of whom are still alive, but they would think I was dead if I didn't tell them right now.</p> <p>I had my first meeting with my dad's lawyer that morning. The lawyer has been very nice to me. I'm really interested.</p> <p>After this meeting, he left and I left my parents.</p> <p>I decided to do some internet research. I checked the internet records on this web site from my college. There was my roommate's home address. There was mine.</p> <p>I opened the first contact list and checked with the name she gave me. She answered the first two and showed me the name to get to her first cell phone.</p> <p>This was a girl named Sue. I wondered why she had a sister. I was curious to check her out.</p> <p>She had a daughter on the other end of that phone. I thought she would like someone older.</p> <p>I have some pictures that I had downloaded to the web site and a number of e-mails. They are pretty good. I guess Sue's mom does want to hear them. There are some pics and a few letters in the mail and a phone number.</p> <p>The other person she was with was a woman I have never really seen before. She looked to be in her mid to late 30's. She was short. It was hard to tell.</p> <p>I decided to make my move while I was still single.</p> <p>The last time I saw Sue was a birthday party for my sister's high school class. She was wearing her black teddies. My sister was wearing her teddies.</p> <p>I didn't hear anything through all the noise. I was just going in.</p> <p>"How's Sue you look tonight, honey" I said.</p> <p>"My dad's lawyers are here to take care of you. Are you ready to go?"</p> <p>"Sure, let's go".</p> <p>Our ride to the lawyer's house is slow. It takes us about 20 minutes. He was a very cool fellow and really knew the system of things. He really knew what went on out there.</p> <p>After we walked into the door to the old and worn building, we could hear the lawyers and others talking. They couldn't be heard very well, but it was clear that the meeting was to be conducted outside the school grounds.</p> <p>I could see the back of my sister's room.</p> <p>While I was looking down the hallway I couldn't stop thinking about Sue. I just love going on dates and going to parties. Maybe it has always been part of me, but I still feel like I lost my virginity. I guess now I know just how I am.</p> <p>"You are really a special woman. I really love you and always will love you" I said in my best and most sincere voice.</p> <p>We walked out to her room. I kissed her. I knew I had broken something.</p> <p>"Where are the pictures of you and I going to visit?"</p> <p>"In my room. If you want pictures of me, please let me ask you."</p> <p>With that, I grabbed her teddy on our way out of her room. I told her she could try to not get a reputation as such or anything else.</p> <p>"Can't you get the pictures to some website?" I asked.</p> <p>"Of course," she replied trying to keep the sarcasm as honest as possible. "Why don't you just send them to someone you have a friend or girlfriend?" I asked.</p> <p>"Well, I can do that but I should really get it off my chest. It's not like it's going to stop here."</p> <p>She took a deep breath and said. "Okay."</p> <p>We met my friend and her family in my room the following evening. I am a little nervous at this point as I just came home. I didn't know what she looked like. I decided that I would see, but I don't really want to get too into the details yet.</p> <p>That night, we had sex twice. I got off pretty quickly, maybe because Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
