"You like?"</p> <p>"Mmmm," he replies, looking at her cleavage. "I love looking at your cleavage."</p> <p>She reaches up her arm, pulling her blouse open and bunching it at the back of her neck. Pulling it over her head, he pushes her gently away. "No, no," she whispers. "I want you inside me." Her hands run through his hair.</p> <p>He pushes her roughly against the wall. He pulls off her blouse, unbuckles his pants, and throws it aside. He unzips his pants and pulls out his cock and puts it to her mouth.</p> <p>"Suck it," he commands, and she does so. She doesn't have to be told. He pushes it right into her mouth. She gags a little. He looks down at her face, and she's laughing. He doesn't bother with the apology. He can tell, though, that she does want him to do this. He pushes it right back out and she gags a little again.</p> <p>He holds her up by the throat and pushes himself back into her mouth. He thrusts in and out a couple of times before going all the way in. At the same time, she starts to squirm under him. She feels him pushing deep up into her body. She's crying and he's pushing into her, pushing and coming in waves. He pulls out of her mouth and they're both laughing, and kissing and looking each other over, for what they're doing to each other.</p> <p>"You're beautiful," she finally says.</p> <p>He gives her a kiss and says, "Now I know what women like to feel."</p> <p>"You're just saying that."</p> <p>"Of course."</p> <p>"Would it shock you if I told you I was thinking about you?" She looks up from her knees to watch him.</p> <p>"Only if it's what makes you feel beautiful."</p> <p>"I mean, I like you. I want you."</p> <p>"I want you too. I'm not a virgin. You're right." He pulls out of her mouth and kisses her passionately. The kiss leads to her body. He puts her on her back and climbs on top of her, pressing himself to her. She wraps her legs around him and pulls him in, pulling him as deep up inside her as she can. He lifts her legs up and grabs each ankle and slowly starts to push himself into her.</p> <p>"It's like having sex."</p> <p>"It really is."</p> <p>"But, as with so many things, there's just something, you know?"</p> <p>"Yes. It's like having a penis."</p> <p>"I like sex too."</p> <p>"It's not just you that gets me excited."</p> <p>"It doesn't matter what you like or don't like, or what you like, or how you like to feel, or about how you feel."</p> <p>"Well, I like that a lot. Not as much as yours."</p> <p>"Well," he continues, "I like kissing you. I like making love to you. I like the way you feel under me, and that's very sexy."</p> <p>"Oh, you make me feel wonderful."</p> <p>"And I think you're a good kisser." He presses himself to her. He puts his hands under her and strokes around, letting his fingertips dance up and down her sides. "I'm going to make love to you until you've come three times tonight, and we're going to make each other happy, okay?"</p> <p>"Okay," she says, breathing deeply for the second time that day, "you know I do. That is, if you can make me come three times tonight." She smiles and kisses him. "I'm glad I have someone who knows what they like. You are sexy."</p> <p>"My fault," he replies. "I just like kissing you to make you feel good. But not as good as you like."</p> <p>"Good for you," she says, a little sarcastically.</p> <p>"What are you going to do with the rest of your clothes?"</p> <p>"I'm going to put my clothes away. I can put my shirt on and I'll stay here, I guess. But, what are you going to do?"</p> <p>"I'm going to put on my shoes," he says, pulling his shirt off and stepping over to his clothes. "I just got out of a bath." He pulls on some shoes.</p> <p>"I have my shoes," she says. They kiss again. "Where were we good?" she asks.</p> <p>"I'm not ready to be anywhere else, but it's nice to be comfortable.
