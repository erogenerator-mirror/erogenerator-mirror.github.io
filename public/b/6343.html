She responded,</p> <p>"Yes?"</p> <p>"I'm going to go and take a break until I hear from you. Maybe I should wait a few minutes longer. How can it be late? If you're here with me, I'll be your friend." I said, and started pulling on my pants.</p> <p>I looked up and saw her in the mirror. "Is that the way you dress when you were younger, or is this your first time? I'm sorry!"</p> <p>"It's all yours." I said with honesty. I was ready to give up and do some of that again.</p> <p>I took my place at the bar. I knew it was wrong. I was her friend and I loved her.</p> <p>I couldn't think about anything, and I couldn't talk. I just watched her. She was standing there drinking a drink. We were talking about everything and nothing.</p> <p>Finally she took off her glasses and said, "There you go. Go and ask if you can buy me a drink."</p> <p>"Let me pay. When I pay for my drinks, I'll let you take care of me." I said boldly.</p> <p>By then, the bottle was empty. I was glad.</p> <p>Lara was feeling generous. I noticed a couple of people in the lobby waiting. They didn't seem very happy. I stood, and we both went to the bar, ordered the same drink we had been drinking, and started laughing and talking until it was time to hit the road.</p> <p>Lara was still smiling.</p> <p>As we got on the elevator, I held her hand, and said, "Lara, if you're this drunk, I don't think I can do this again."</p> <p>"You're sure?" She said, and kissed my cheek again.</p> <p>It was my turn to smile.</p> <p>The elevator was a bit crowded at first, but it was more like someone was waiting to share food. I took my hand from her hand, and started taking off my pants. She turned to me, "I need to get it from that bottle, don't worry. I don't care anymore."</p> <p>Lara went to the back of the elevator. I was standing at the other end of the hall, and I felt my pants falling to the floor. She was walking towards me in full view, and I felt as if I was going to fall down.</p> <p>I stopped her, "I'm sorry...."</p> <p>"Are you?" She asked me.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, and yes, I do. I don't plan to fall again!"</p> <p>"Good. I want to get you home, and I want you to stay the night."</p> <p>"Sure...." Was all I could get out.</p> <p>We finished our drinks, and I grabbed our coats. I went back to my room, and when I got there, it wasn't Lara's room. It was her old room. I opened the door and let myself in.</p> <p>I took off my clothes, and I was still naked from the waist down. I was sitting on the bench as I looked through all of the books I had been looking at. All of the ones I had been looking at were still a little on the shelf, and just a few. I took off my shoes, and socks. I was a dirty boy, and had to give them up. I started taking off my clothes.</p> <p>I put my shirt over my head. I was totally naked except for my boxer-briefs.</p> <p>I looked up at the door. I got up, undid my shorts, and pulled my underwear down to my knees.</p> <p>"Come." I said, and walked towards the door. At the end of the hallway, I put my hands on her face, and kissed her, letting her feel my hard cock. She opened her mouth and it went in.</p> <p>She was kissing my mouth. I pulled back, and looked at her. The door had a light on, and it was coming from the bathroom.</p> <p>I walked down to the bathroom, and there was another light coming from the doorway. It was her!</p> <p>I opened the door and she was walking towards me. I said, "Lara?"</p> <p>We had our kissing now. I had her pressed up against the wall, kissing her, and I felt my cock rubbing up and down her leg. I pulled her against me, feeling my cock as it slid up and down her leg. I took her breast in my mouth, sucking on her tit. I was already hard as I got naked.</p> <p>I put her down onto the couch, and she opened her legs. I leaned over herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
