He slid two fingers over her clit, pressing hard enough to cause her to jerk against him. He teased against her, his tongue slipping into her lips, caressing her until their tongues danced.</p> <p>“Oh god,” She moaned again.</p> <p>“What’s the matter?”</p> <p>She looked at him, her eyes pleading with him to stay still. “I…I’m so uncomfortable. Don’t make me climax. Please…please just let me relax,” she begged.</p> <p>Her gaze fixed him, her face tight with pain and shame. She felt him start to move a finger, slipping it inside her. She shuddered as he pushed them farther inside. His thumb stroked her clit, driving her crazy.</p> <p>“Don’t make me cum,” she begged him again. “Let me concentrate and make myself cum,” she demanded as she pulled against her bounds.</p> <p>With a smile, he took his free hand and put it under her chin, lifting it up, his thumb pressing lightly against her lips to keep it from her screaming. She moaned as he slowly rubbed, pressing her to the brink. His thumb pushed into her, slowly, slowly, until they were moving apart again. She moaned as he began to stroke her clit again, bringing it into his mouth. He sucked it between his lips, flicking his tongue over it until the whole of her clit was in his mouth.</p> <p>“Oh yes,” she sighed, arching toward him. His hand lifted and slipped under her body, sliding under the tight fabric of her top. When he touched her nipples she shivered, arching higher when he found a hard point of pleasure and rubbed it with his fingertips. She cried out as they rolled over and together he cupped her, squeezing her hard until her breasts rose and fell against his hand.</p> <p>“Oh yes,”</p> <p>With a groan he twisted his wrist between his fingers until he was twisting his wrist back and forth, stretching the nipple. He pressed his mouth down against it, flicking his tongue over it as he continued to stroke her. She felt herself getting close, his fingers twisting, and his teeth lightly scraping her sensitive bud. With a groan she arched against him even more, pressing against him. She was almost there again when she felt his fingers slip from her swollen clit.</p> <p>“Please,” she begged him again as she fought not to climax. “Please, I’m...I can’t—oh, god...oh my god...just put it inside...put it inside my...please....”</p> <p>He slipped his hands under her arms and lifted her to her feet. He lifted her onto his hips so her pussy was hovering over his hardness. He wrapped his arms around her, pressing his hips upwards until she felt his swollen head slip between her pussy lips, his lips brushing over hers. He held himself still for a moment, and then his hips began to lift, driving himself into her. Her eyes rolled back in her head as the pleasure hit her, and she cried out. He lifted her body, sliding his fingers through the wet hair until the knuckle pressed to her hole. Then he was sliding into her, the tightness of her tunnel, the heat of her, the tightness and the friction of her pussy, the hot, wet, smoothness, the smoothness and the friction, the feeling of fullness and the sensation when his erection slid into her.</p> <p>“Oh, yes,” she groaned as she felt the thick head of his erection nudging her clit. He lifted her, slipping out from between her legs and then sliding back into her. She held onto the cot in front of her, her face pressed against the pillowed one. He held himself still inside her for a moment as he felt his erection begin to stiffen inside her. It felt so good—so wonderful—so tight...so warm...</p> <p>“Please, John,” she moaned, the words coming out sloppily as she moved her hips faster, pushing toward him with each thrust.</p> <p>He kissed her lips and clit while he continued to push deeper inside until her moans grew longer, deeper almost a scream. “Yes, John…fuck me...fuck me...don’t say,” she cried.</p> <p>He thrust into her one last time, her pussy gripping him tightly as he came, their body shaking as their passion peaked.</p> <p>“Don’t stop,” she moaned when they broke apart.</p> <p>He reached over and gathered some tissues to dry his semen from her skin, then he turned her around on her—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
