Yet, despite my confusion, I was aroused more than ever. Her cunt was moist, the folds moist and smooth. I knew it was because of the way she'd rubbed herself the previous night. Her thighs were still parted apart and I could see her lips glistening, just like before.</p> <p>I pushed my face down into her crotch, pressing my nose firmly against the hair as my tongue pressed into her. She pushed her pelvis up at me. I could feel her breathing more acutely. I could feel it against my chin as my lips slid along her labia to her clit. For a moment I paused, holding my breath for a moment as her body reacted. Then I pushed my tongue flat against her, my tongue flicking her clit softly and deliberately.</p> <p>I could feel her body stiffening slightly. Her hips began to push up from the cushion as she began to move herself under my mouth. Her hands slid onto my arms and I could feel them tightening. I was still unsure of what her intentions were and what I wanted to do to her, but my eagerness seemed to her.</p> <p>"Oh.... Oh.... Oh..... Oh....... Oh....... Don't... Don't tease.... Don't... tease me... I'm.... going..... to..... to...... cum."</p> <p>"Go for it Jenny..." I said, my face still pressing against her mound. She was pushing herself back again, her legs shaking as she came again. And I was still licking her. And... and.... "Don't tease me now... don't tease me" I ordered. As I spoke I pushed my tongue into her cunt again, and she started to move herself up and down on my face. I was still tasting her juices on her thigh. She started to shudder and her legs shook. It took a moment for her to come down from that high. I felt her shaking and then begin to relax again.</p> <p>"Not so fast, darling" I told her. She shook again and looked into my eyes, "I'm not done... not by a long shot," she said. "It feels wonderful."</p> <p>"Mmmm, I like that" I said quietly. "Just do it to me"</p> <p>She hesitated, and then said again, "Nooooo, I want it... need it... I want it, please..."</p> <p>"But don't forget to do it yourself - that's your job."</p> <p>She gave me a weak smile and then began slowly and deliberately. She moved her pelvis up and down again and again. "Oh.... Oh... Oh....... It's.... so good..." she breathed. Gradually, she pulled herself up and then dropped back down, her body writhing and quivering.</p> <p>At first, I just held my tongue still. I tried to keep her in place. It felt wonderful and warm on my tongue. I liked her reaction. To feel it between my teeth and her body against my face was indescribably good. But there was more. I'd been holding my tongue there. She'd held it at the bottom of her cunt, just as a baby would hold up a pacifier. She'd also pulled herself up so she could be more comfortable. More comfortable. And so she continued slowly, as I'd seen her do before. With the very tip of my tongue she was able to push my tongue down into her.</p> <p>"Oh... Oh..... Oh...... Oh.... Oh.... Oh......" She kept on. I knew she was getting closer and closer to orgasm.</p> <p>But just as her excitement level was approaching that point, she paused and pulled away from me. With her fingers, she held my head as she pushed herself up. She'd been holding herself down, trying to reach some semblance of control, to get it over with. But for a fraction of a second the muscles inside her cunt relaxed so that I could feel them throb and pulse as her cum flowed out. As it was she was still pressing herself down and her fingers held tight to my head and I kept licking her.</p> <p>That movement was all it took for her to come again. She screamed in ecstasy as her orgasm seemed to start somewhere between my own and her own. Her body jerked once before she came down completely. I could feel myself shaking inside me and she said, "I've got to take a swig of water - you're soaked."</p> <p>"What?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I'm soaking wet," she said. "You smell. You smell, like..." she pointed between her legs, "like, me."</p> <p>I thought I caught something in her faceâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
