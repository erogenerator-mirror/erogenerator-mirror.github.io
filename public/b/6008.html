How can I compete with that?” She stopped as if the answer, and I said,</p> <p>“I really don’t know anything. But now why don’t you tell me?” I asked as she smiled a weak smile and we followed me upstairs.</p> <p>As the door closed and I shut the lamp off, I felt the guilt that has caused me the most, of all, the things I have done over the last twenty years. And there is nothing that I could ever do to make her forgive me. She might forgive me even if she didn’t tell me, it would just be a matter to convince her that she didn’t love me.</p> <p>After what seemed like an eternity of silence, and as she looked into my eyes with a questionive expression, she whispered, “I just realized my love for you. So now I must be a bad person.” She paused, and I asked,</p> <p>“Do you love me, just as much as you want to love me, and more. You have always seemed so important to me.” My reply took a pause. She leaned in and kissed me lightly. Her lips were soft, full, and warm. She kissed me more and again our tongues caressed as they touched one another, and I could feel how it felt. We pulled our lips apart, and I said,</p> <p>“I don’t know what else to say. How could I possibly love anyone but you?” I kissed her again, and again the same passion as before. I took her face between my hands and placed it on my chest. I kissed her mouth and then her neck, and softly began to kiss and lick her there as if I was a kitten licking a bowl of milk. As the kisses intensified in intensity, she closed her eyes in anticipation of my licking her body and I slowly began to work my way toward her breast.</p> <p>A little more of her body covered with goose bumps formed on her skin as I moved my kisses from the base of her throat to her breasts. I was careful to keep myself away from the sensitive skin between her breasts and the surrounding area above them, as I couldn’t take any chances of getting hurt by where my fingers had been. But that could not be all that it was for she was very turned on, and I felt her tremble at my touch. Her fingers, on my fingers, she was massaging my cheeks and then pressing them softly into her breasts. I slid my hand to her breast and felt her nipple harden and begin to swell. I leaned in a little more and slowly blew on her nipple, and she moaned. I began to tease her with light circles around her nipple, and she squirmed and squirmed, and I slid a finger into her slit. She was wet enough. I took her nipple in my mouth, and she moaned again. I lightly kissed my way around her lips and licked her mouth. I began to lick the tip of her tongue, and she pulled my face into her cleavage, and I began to work my way to the base. Now my tongue was all but grazing her nipple in circles, and she began to shake her hips, and I could smell her heat. I began to rub my tongue in circles on her nipple. She arched her back, and I knew that in about two minutes if I didn’t do something, she would have orgasm. I heard her whimper quietly, which she didn’t seem to want, but I ignored it, and continued to tease her, with little strokes from my tongue and my fingers. She began to grind her hips more, and I slid a finger into her, and she began to rock her body in rhythm with my tongue. She began to breath harder, and the scent in her body became a lot more musky, and I realized that I was in trouble. I slid my fingers inside her, and brought up my hand and brought it up to her lips and pressed my fingertip against her pussy as she squirmed. She looked into my eyes and said,</p> <p>“I love it when you kiss me this way, you know I’m your new lover.” I looked at her and said,</p> <p>“Yes I know,” and she smiled so sweetly at me that I couldn’t help but kiss her again just as I had before—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
