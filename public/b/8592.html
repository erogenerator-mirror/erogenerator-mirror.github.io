"I thought it would be a good idea before."</p> <p>"Don't worry...I'll be back at my place again if I can't use it," I said, and that little smile started to creep again.</p> <p>"Don't worry!" she yelled through the door, "I know how to use it!"</p> <p>I opened the door, but she left and I couldn't believe what I had heard. How could she be a friend of Dr. Jekyll's? But I wasn't going to ask.</p> <p>I went back to the bedroom, my heart beating so fast. What had I become? That night was a repeat of anything I had done to myself, and the past few hours, my memory. I had done more than just go to Jekyll's for a night's snuggling, but it had been just... fun. It wasn't anything I had done before. No, it was a dream that was so real right before our first night together.</p> <p>Chapter 18: A New Beginning</p> <p>I awoke in the morning, just then, and sat up in bed. I smiled when I saw her sleeping; she seemed so fresh, like something from a different time. As if she had been waiting for me. I kissed the top of her head.</p> <p>"Good morning, sunshine," I said to her.</p> <p>"Good morning!" She said. "I was worried about the way we had slept. I didn't expect you back that early."</p> <p>"I just wanted to talk for a minute before I had to take a shower."</p> <p>"Do you really want to talk about this again?"</p> <p>"I've been thinking about it," I said. "And, you," I added. "Are good girls."</p> <p>"Yeah, but it's still too early..."</p> <p>"So, what is it?" I wanted to know.</p> <p>"Well..."</p> <p>"You want to talk about it. You need to know everything you want to say," I answered.</p> <p>"No, I don't want my first time to be a lot of it," she said. "I want it to be special."</p> <p>"OK, but don't expect you to always want more," I said.</p> <p>"But I want it to be different," she said. "I've wanted for so long to be with a man again."</p> <p>"I'm glad," I said, "because it's not like I have that many boyfriends. It's been really good for me to be with a man." I knew right then the beginning of a relationship with a boy.</p> <p>"OK. Whatever it is, just let me know and we will go on," she said.</p> <p>The next morning there were no plans. I don't know how she came to this place, but it was there. We drove in silence to the clinic, and we talked and made arrangements. The sex with Dr. Jekyll was really good, but that wasn't what this was about. That, and sex and the sex with the man it was about. The sex with Dr. Jekyll was great, but her job involved some work and she didn't want to be with him for long. That wasn't for her, anyway. That was just as far as he was willing to go. The sex with Julie and me was great.</p> <p>The sex with Julie was great. That is, if she wasn't expecting it to be. But it wasn't as if you just had sex with your roommate. We were making love, just like friends like we had been, but the sex was a friendlike arrangement.</p> <p>At least the sex with Julie was much more than she could have imagined. It was like we had been intimate for years. The sex was intimate as much as we had been. There might have been others, but we had spent many days in the same bed. Sex wasn't as good as it could be between people, and we did not talk about sex. It wasn't as if it made us feel like girls. That was true enough. But there was something about the sex between us. A mutual commitment that just felt right and natural. And, by the way, it felt so natural to spend time in bed together.</p> <p>Chapter 19: The Beginning of an Understanding</p> <p>The sex was good. We did it as friends that we knew. The sex was good, too, but it was a relationship between a couple. That is, there weren't two people that did it at the same time. And I liked the sex better when she was in bed with me. It was much more intimate with her there in the hospital bed than with us. That was how I would want to spend the rest of my life.
