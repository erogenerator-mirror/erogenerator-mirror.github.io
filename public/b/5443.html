"I just came, about fifteen minutes ago. Your name is Tasha, I think. Don't leave my friends out! You're an asshole!"</p> <p>"I don't have a name. I'm Tasha," I said.</p> <p>"I'm Tom, and this is my friend Lisa," he added.</p> <p>Lisa grinned at Tom. His face was unreadable, a little boyish with his dark skin. Her friends couldn't stop giggling. I'm so hot! She looked back at me.</p> <p>"Where's Tom?"</p> <p>"In the bedroom, I think. Just got him a beer."</p> <p>Lisa smiled and reached forward to take Tom by the shoulders from their conversation.</p> <p>"How long was the phone?" I asked.</p> <p>She shook her head, looking away from me a little.</p> <p>"It wasn't a long distance, was it?" She asked Tom as she turned to head for the bedroom.</p> <p>"Yeah, it was," Tom replied.</p> <p>She turned back to face me.</p> <p>"Where's Tasha?"</p> <p>Tom shrugged.</p> <p>"I've been outside the door for a while with this neighbor boy," he said. "We were talking about how long it is now with the summer," he added pointing at Lisa. "Yeah, the neighbor boy is in there somewhere right now." He chuckled. "So it's not the right time for a big party."</p> <p>"No party," I said. I turned and walked off. I felt a little strange, and then suddenly it clicked in my mind. That's your house. Tom's home. If he had to be there, it's because I'd left him another note. I sat on my bed feeling miserable. What the fuck is this all about, Lisa? It could be me. It could be that big mess that's between Tom and his mom. I felt sick again. I was so alone in my house right now. It was probably my fault that I hadn't put Tasha on the phone when I arrived. I guess I was the one that got drunk, you know? I should have just packed all my stuff, went up to the house, and let myself in. Well, I just didn't do it all that often. So, I'm sure if I had to do something, it wouldn't be the right time. Well, if he hadn't said anything to say, it would, I don't know, but it sure would have worked out well before, I guess. I don't think I'm an asshole!" I spat the last out.</p> <p>I closed my eyes, sat still for a few minutes trying to get hold of what I'd said, or what she had said.</p> <p>"Tasha?" Tom finally picked up after a minute.</p> <p>"Tasha, you can get over yourself," I said, not even sure I was going to continue.</p> <p>His face was still emotionless as he looked at me. It still hurt me that way. I wanted to hold him, to kiss him, to hug him. I was going to need a lot of time to think through this. It was like I had a bad case of "I should be going, but he's getting better." This wasn't me. I was just the person that needed a hug.</p> <p>"Tasha," he said, holding me tighter. "I'm sorry. It's just..." He trailed off and just held me.</p> <p>"Shh, shh, shhh, it's okay, it's just a bit more complicated..."</p> <p>I put my head on his chest. I was so worried, so afraid of him. I knew I was doing something that was wrong. That I couldn't control what happened. I felt my eyes begin to water. What had I gotten into here, what did a good thing have to do? Did I do everything wrong. Tasha had only been there because she was so tired. I needed time to think. I looked to Tom. He was still holding me, but was slowly lowering me down onto his lap. He kissed the tip of my nose and brushed my chin. I took it as a good sign, not to take it too far. I got up reluctantly and ran into the bathroom. I tried to wash my face and hands, but I just couldn't seem to get it right. I took the soap, scrubbed off slowly, and washed my whole body. I finished washing up when Tasha came in. She looked so beautiful standing next to me.</p> <p>"Tasha, you look so good," he said.</p> <p>"Thanks, Tom," she smiled back.</p> <p>"I've missed you so muchâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
