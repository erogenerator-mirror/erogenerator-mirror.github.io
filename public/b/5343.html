But I'm afraid of the consequences. I'm afraid of losing you, but I'm afraid of losing you, because I wouldn't have given you up without your consent. I have no desire to lose you. I can't live the rest of my life with you in the same way as I do at my age."</p> <p>He was silent, feeling very guilty. "Look, it will make it really hard for you to tell anyone about this. I'll let you think about it, but I can't promise anything."</p> <p>"I can't say anything to the kids. And even if I did say anything, please don't change what you're doing to me. You're my teacher. I'm just your student. They think I'm some kind of criminal with a criminal record."</p> <p>He looked away. All of a sudden he felt very vulnerable. He wanted his friends to know he and I were in love. They saw the look of hurt and regret in his eyes but at the same time they wanted to be able to help. There was a big emotional weight in his belly, and it seemed important to be there, to be a part of the process.</p> <p>He was suddenly embarrassed. He knew it was wrong; he knew that all of his friends expected him to love what he was doing. He knew he shouldn't be doing this, but he couldn't get out of it. If I could just turn to the kids when it happened, he might not be so embarrassed.</p> <p>"I just want to go back to my little boys. So I can show you how much I love you."</p> <p>He took a step back, looking in her direction. "No, please, don't do that."</p> <p>"I understand," she said, and she reached out her hand to him. "You need your mother. She loves you."</p> <p>"She would kill me if I ever hurt her again," he said in his best, most convincing tone of voice.</p> <p>He leaned down to give her a long passionate kiss. I don't know if I've ever wanted one so much as if I were in love with her the very next second.</p> <p>"Can we call it a night?" he said as though it were a prayer.</p> <p>She smiled. "Yes, we can call it a night," she added, and she turned and pulled him in for another passionate kiss.</p> <p>All I could think is, "We shouldn't be doing this. What would our parents say if they saw us? And what happens if we're caught. Please tell them I love them."</p> <p>"We can do it, we both know there's no other choice."</p> <p>"But, then what would they say?"</p> <p>"We'll have to find out."</p> <p>****</p> <p>That night, after the kids came downstairs to do homework, I couldn't keep my hands off of Nancy. We went to bed together and she made passionate love to me in bed. We had so much fun. There really wasn't much to do, just lying in bed spooned together.</p> <p>One night we went to bed early. I felt the bed move as she slipped next to me. She put her arm around me and held me close. When we did sleep, she said, "I really missed you."</p> <p>"Yeah. I missed you, too."</p> <p>"We're getting married next week and we have to figure out how to explain our lovemaking to Mom and Dad."</p> <p>"We're not marrying each other."</p> <p>"That's true. Besides, if you want to get married, you are not going to get the benefit of the marriage if you don't fuck other people."</p> <p>"What? I'm not getting married? I'm not even sure Mom's going to be all that happy."</p> <p>"We just need to think this through now before we talk about it."</p> <p>We kissed and I told her what I had been thinking all day. I had never done anything with a woman before. She wasn't happy about me being with another woman either.</p> <p>"That's a wonderful idea," she replied. She held me, not sure how comfortable she felt, and not sure I'd be able to go through with it.</p> <p>"I need you to know that I loved you from the start. I felt like I'd never be able to live with myself. You were the only thing I felt like being happy with."</p> <p>We got out of bed for our honeymoon. We hadn't planned on anything too serious, but what was just going onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
