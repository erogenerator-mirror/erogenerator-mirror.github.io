She lifted her foot and I took in her sexy toes in my hands. They were long and slender with a slight upward curve to each of them. They were perfectly formed and I love to play foot of all things, especially hers. I knew that for most men, but I have never seen more grace behind a long toe as I now was doing. It took me awhile to figure out what she was referring to and I had just begun when she said, "I think you have a really cute cock now."</p> <p>I lowered my head down and she was about to reply. Her words caught my attention and my cock almost got erect with the thought of that and now it was time to speak.</p> <p>I spoke first. "I have to tell you that your foot is beautiful. I love toes and a woman with large pair of feet doesn't waste time on foot play. In fact I am so turned on, I'm ready to cum right now."</p> <p>She giggled, "That's better," then took my hand and lead me over to an upholstered chair. The chair was comfortable and the soft wood felt wonderful on my skin. She had me lie on my stomach while she pulled down my boxers and began to lick my entire body. Her soft smooth lips sucked my balls deep into her mouth as she ran her tongue around the shaft and licked up the juices of the head of my cock. Finally she had my entire head in her mouth and slid her tongue down onto my shaft as she took it completely inside.</p> <p>She moved her tongue slowly over my cock just to the head but soon she slid down until she bottomed out on my pubic mound. She worked her head back up and off my erection until she was able to push her head down to the base of my cock again. She repeated this maneuver again and again, her tongue dancing and lightly tickling my balls and the ridge under it. After she had me close to climaxing she backed off slowly but firmly before going around my cock. She kept at it until I was close but didn't stop. We continued like that for the next several minutes and then she said, "I want you to come deep inside me."</p> <p>I didn't even bother to say yes. I was so close to that point I thought I was going to explode right there. There was no stopping me now and I needed that release. She just kept stroking with her hand until I finally was able to get it. My body was shaking as my orgasm exploded through me. She kept slowly stroking until my cock quit shooting and then she pulled off my deflating cock with an audible slurp and sat down on me. Once I was all recovered, she slid off the chair slowly and sat next to me with her face to me. She leaned over and kissed me gently on the lips.</p> <p>She said, "I want some of that."</p> <p>I lifted her face towards mine and kissed her with passion and passion as our tongues swirled together. I reached over with my hand and took hold of a soft silky breast with a very firm nipple. I played with her nipples and felt the hardness of the nub as I rolled it between my finger tips.</p> <p>I kissed her for a long while. We kissed hard and long, moaning and sighing with each kiss. She pulled the tie on her top and removed it letting it fall to the floor before she tossed it to the floor and took my hand and led me by the hand towards her bedroom. She paused at her room for a moment when we approached before saying. "I want to take care of that."</p> <p>As I followed her to the bedroom I looked at my erection and said, "I thought I said no orgasms."</p> <p>"Yes you did. And you need them but my body is telling you differently."</p> <p>She lay back on the bed with her legs wide apart as I kneeled on the bed face to face with her. I kissed my way down her stomach stopping briefly to look at her sex and then my way.</p> <p>I looked at it between her lips and then back up at her. Her mouth was wet and inviting and just below each of her breasts were two hard nipples standing erect and hard.</p> <p>I bent forward and kissed her lips and she reached up and lightly took my head in one hand as she moaned. I kissed and licked both of them for a long time before bringing my mouth back to her nipples and sucking and licking. They hardened with her excitement and she arched her back pressing them into my mouth.</p> <p>I switched a nipple and repeated my actions on the other before she said, "God it feels so good."</p> <p>She spread her legs slightly as my mouth continued its sensuous path all her sensitive skin. Her pussy was absolutely beautiful and every nerve ending in her body seemed to be alive.
