"I came home from work to find her at dinner alone. I had no idea she was here, you saw her. So that was the catalyst that caused me to come to you.</p> <p>"So you came home to make love with me?" he asked, wondering what he was getting into.</p> <p>"It's only fair you have to share me for once."</p> <p>"Fair? What does fair have to do with making love? Is it cheating if only I let you fuck me then?"</p> <p>"Is cheating cheating cheating?" he questioned. "Is cheating cheating cheating?"</p> <p>"Absolutely. You can't ask me twice. If your man had just come home and offered you a chance to go to bed with me, maybe we would have talked a long time ago."</p> <p>"You still don't even know my name?"</p> <p>My reply was, "Of course not. But I have been waiting for you to come home. That was the first time in awhile that I felt the same kind of love in someone. There is nothing wrong with being your lover or even sharing a woman. I wanted to make love so much with you, I have wanted to do that for a long time." I saw his response in his face.</p> <p>"I was never attracted to a woman that had a cock. I could still feel the guilt of not having such a long penis. I wanted to give you that cock." I saw him start to change his thoughts. He really loved me, and I knew that he would always love me! "Can you make love with me?"</p> <p>"You don't know me."</p> <p>I looked at him for several moments wondering if he really meant what he said. "You need to ask, do you want to keep sharing me as long as you can?"</p> <p>"Yes, of course I do."</p> <p>I laid back down and pulled him with me. We fell asleep within seconds. I awoke a short time later to the gentle snoring of a tired lover.</p> <p>I felt the bed move and realized that Eric had snuggled up to me. He kissed my forehead, my eyelids, the corner of eyelids and kissed me again.</p> <p>"Happy birthday baby! You're just about the biggest surprise a kid has ever had in his life! I love you so much!"</p> <p>"Thanks baby! I love you too! I have missed you!"</p> <p>He kissed my forehead again and I could feel the warmth of his body next to mine. The warmth of his kiss was very soothing, very soothing. I could feel the slight tingling sensation of his penis pressed against me.</p> <p>"Are there any other surprises I should know about?" he asked.</p> <p>"I didn't have sex with any other man, I didn't do anything with any other man until tonight. I have been planning this for a very long time." His answer gave me the courage to ask another question. "What else do you want to tell me?"</p> <p>"That was a good question! I'll tell you about it tomorrow!"</p> <p>"I want to tell you about how you can use it to get your date interested in that black man!" There was a pause before he answered my question. He got up from the bed and walked to stand next to me. He embraced me and kissed me again. After a minute he went back to the bed. With his hand he slowly took off my top and took off my skirt. He got on the bed and we resumed our kissing. As our kiss continued, my hand reached the hem of his tuxedo jacket and caressed his chest.</p> <p>My hand slowly stroked his erection through his clothing. I felt a drop of pre-cum form on the tip of his cock. I gently stroked him. He responded by kissing me even more passionately than the morning they had me. I continued stroking his erection until he pulled away from me.</p> <p>"Baby, I want more," he said as he got off the bed. He took my hand and led me to the closet. He pulled me up against the closet door, kissed me passionately, and went back to the bed.</p> <p>I got on the bed in front of him, sat up, and took his tuxedo pants off. He quickly climbed on top of me and we resumed our passionate kissing. I removed his clothing. My hands caressing his body as he removed my shoes. My lips kiss him everywhere as he removes my skirt. Naked, lying on the bed, with my legs open, he kisses me from my toes up to my vagina. I love the feeling of a mouth licking and kissing my lips while his tongue strokes my clit...</p> <p>When he has done that, he slowly pushed his finger into me.
