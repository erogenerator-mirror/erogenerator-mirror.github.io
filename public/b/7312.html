With each push, he slipped deeper, until his skin was pressed back into mine, with his cock still inside of me. He pulled out, but it was still hard.</p> <p>My eyes were still shut, and I opened them after I opened mine as I gasped for air. When I realized our positions, he still had his eyes locked on mine, and the strength of his grip pulled me in tight onto his cock once again. A single word escaped my lips, "I-I didn't know he had that up-front." When I stopped, my body went still.</p> <p>My mind took over again. Not only was my husband still in my body, I could feel my pussy lips pressed against the outside surface of his cock. I thought about the other way it had been used before, where my body had received only a few strokes during my short and wild sex, but this time it felt like someone stroking their cock against it. I tried to imagine, but I couldn't. The thought of it made me shudder.</p> <p>My body continued to writhe against him, feeling the softness of his lips in my face, and my hands. In one swift move, he turned us around again, and lifted my body in his arms, where he placed himself on one knee, and pressed my body even more fully against his.</p> <p>"I want you." His voice was soft, but it was also the most masculine.</p> <p>It was like I was floating along a tide, just on my own. I felt like I was floating on a dark sea, and he seemed to know from everything I said, everything I felt...</p> <p>His kiss was hungry. His lips were everywhere. My senses were heightened, my body a jumbled ball of nerves. All my sensations were concentrated in my body. I felt a soft tingling at the base of my spine, down to where the tip of my cock pressed against my pelvis. "I want you." My mind screamed.</p> <p>In that moment, I had been taken fully and completely, and he had been completely taken. I could also feel how his hand on my neck gave me a gentle massage. This was all beyond passion. We could do it like animals if we needed to. But it didn't bother me any more. It seemed as natural as breathing, and it was all I needed. I felt that my body had reached the point of climax when it took him over the edge as well. It was no longer my body that seemed to hold his power, it was now his.</p> <p>He lifted me up to his chest, and he held me so that I could wrap my arms around his forearms, and press my body into him. He pulled me closer to him, and kissed the top of my head while I felt him throb against me. Before I knew anything, I had moved away from the railing, and I was kissing down his neck.</p> <p>I could feel my body go wild and felt the blood pulsing back into my body throughout my entire body. He was holding me too tightly, so I pulled back, and looked up into his eyes. All I could say is "I like you."</p> <p>He leaned his head down and kissed me lightly on the lips. I felt my breath catch in my throat as I felt my heart racing. I felt like it took care of all its own, and would never need the other again. My legs felt weak, and my knees ached, and I could feel myself moving from the edge of my seat, up the steps of the porch, and my hands were trembling.</p> <p>My stomach was flat, and I felt myself feeling dizzy. With my arms around my husband, I felt as though I was in another world. I thought about how he had made love to me, and I couldn't imagine that. The only thought in my mind was of how I knew it was going to be. After a moment, I reached one arm up over his head to wrap my fingers around his hair. That's when I felt him grip my jaw with his other hand. I heard a zipper, followed by a groan, and he groaned a second louder. He felt my body shiver.</p> <p>My eyes began to water and my body was quivering uncontrollably. I felt like I was about to explode. "Do you want to go inside?" I heard him say. I just nodded my head, and when I didn't answer quickly enough, his hands let go of my jaw, and he pulled me against him so I could feel both our bodies against each other. I didn't even realize for a split second the tears that were falling from my eyes again until I began to cry, like Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
