I'm going to cum, too," cried her sister, her beautiful, angelic face and body contorted in orgasmic bliss, her hips bucking up and down on my mouth, her hand on my balls, her other hand gripping the arm of the loveseat, and I was cumming.</p> <p>I pulled my lips away from her pussy and she looked up at the ceiling, her face flushed, her body quivering. I held her around the waist in my hands and I felt my sperm spurting up into her vagina, her own body bucking and shuddering while I was shooting sperm. I kept cumming, milking my cock as her orgasmic pleasure kept shudder and shudder, my own pleasure reaching a fever pitch.</p> <p>I rolled off her and I and my cock slipped out of her, my sperm splashing on her thigh. She just laid there. I looked down at my still hard cock and she just lay there with her eyes closed except her breathing and her body twitching.</p> <p>I got up and walked over to the coffee machine, turning on the kettle, preparing a cup. I felt a twinge of guilt, but then dismissed the thought and poured the rest of my coffee on to tpice my hardness.</p> <p>I went back outside, returning with the cup and I handed it to her. She took the cup from my hand and sipped some of the warm milk.</p> <p>"You taste good," she commented, and then, just for a moment, she asked, "So do you now?" then added, "I didn't know you did that."</p> <p>"Well...I don't have any condoms with me. I just have the idea of a pretty good fuck, no pun intended."I grinned to myself, and asked, "How about you?"</p> <p>"What?" Her face clouded as she took the cup again, and then added, "Don't tell me you have them?"</p> <p>"I can get a couple of these handy," I said and went to the bathroom. "Then you can fuck on the couch," I added, watching her go through the kitchen into the kitchen.</p> <p>She came back with three condoms on her coffee table. She went to her purse and pulled three things out and handed them to her sister. "So this isn't just what it looks like," she said to her sister. "He's got a hard-on in his pants."</p> <p>"That's my brother!" A voice, feminine, but definitely feminine said to her from out of the kitchen doorway. "I can't believe he's got woody! But, he's hot! I don't mind."</p> <p>"What's this? What do you mean by hard?"</p> <p>"Your dick!"</p> <p>"I'm kidding."</p> <p>"Come on - do you think?" She smiled at me.</p> <p>"Well..." she said. "I suppose that's what I'm going to do."</p> <p>"Why don't you go sit on the couch and take off his pants?" She got up, her back to me, and she slipped her panties off.</p> <p>"Now is as good as a chance. I'll be right back." She got up and walked towards the couch and sat down next to me."</p> <p>"What's your name?" She asked.</p> <p>"Robert, Robert Anderson," I answered.</p> <p>"Oh...Robert," she said, her big blue eyes twinkling. "So, Robert Anderson, I'm Trisha Thompson. You must be Robert Anderson."</p> <p>"Yes, I'm Robert," I said. "We're just like brother and sister."</p> <p>"But, I didn't know you were brother and sister," said Trisha. "Now, if you'd been a brother and sister, it might have been possible, even if I wasn't. There are a lot of difference."</p> <p>"Don't worry. We're just friends," I whispered to her. "We don't know each other."</p> <p>"I don't know who you are," she said. "What I know is that it's all sex. And it has nothing to do with what they're doing."</p> <p>"I can guarantee there will be more lovemaking," I assured her. "It won't always be all about a hard cock."</p> <p>"Why don't you call the shots now?" She smiled and pulled her dress off and put on the bra, panties, and socks. She sat down and picked up her coffee. "So far," she said, "we're the good old days. Now I need you to call me and tell me what you're doing."</p> <p>I got up and walked out into the kitchen. "Trisha, I think we have some more time before the guys come back. What do you say?" I asked.</p> <p>"Robert, if youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
