The kiss had only just begun and she realized in that moment with the same clarity as before, that she knew just how beautiful her lips looked. Her fingers traced down his chest and she felt his nipple stiffening. She smiled as he shivered.</p> <p>"You have the most beautiful eyes," she said.</p> <p>"Oh?"</p> <p>"Is that so," she said and then she took his hard on into her mouth.</p> <p>She tasted a little of his pre-cum and licked it off his cock until it was clean. The way his head and shaft throbbed against her tongue was intoxicating, reminding her of when she gave him a blow job just before they'd finished making love and she thought of the incredible way he'd reacted when she'd rubbed her little hand up and down his thigh. How her own hand had felt so full and wet when his own fingers had rubbed her wet pussy lips. God, he had a really nice fucking cock. She knew he was only average sized but he was a beautiful and sexy dick. She felt herself grow wet again.</p> <p>The next time they made love together, she'd sat right in the middle of his lap so he was almost in the middle of her chest and with one of her legs on his shoulder, he'd wrapped his arms around her, then she'd taken his dick out of her wet pussy and he'd leaned into her and they'd kissed passionately.</p> <p>That first time had been like no other before. She hadn't remembered her first time being this enjoyable. She'd been surprised how different it was. She'd never done anything like that before in her life. But she knew exactly what to do and when to do it even before they got to that point of no return. Now he was in her, his head on her shoulder, mouth over her breasts and his dick in her cunt. It drove her wild with that feeling.</p> <p>It also gave Jim a thrill to know that she'd let him do whatever he wanted and be in control, to play the dominant role and have the ultimate chance to take his pleasure and not worry about her own. He was definitely enjoying being in that role. And she felt so safe and so protected that if there was even a shred of doubt that he wasn't going to just fuck her; she'd let him. And this was her first time being fucked when it was her, not just with that nice man's dick between her legs and she was pretty sure in retrospect that she'd been fucked like that before he began fucking her. Oh yeah, she'd felt it. He'd let another woman fuck her and oh yes she'd felt his cock deep inside of her and oh yes oh yes she'd felt it!</p> <p>After they had both climaxed they'd just lay there in the Jacuzzi, his arms around her, her head on his chest, his dick semi-hard again. She felt so safe. The first time he'd made love she'd felt it. But this time she really didn't care anymore. She didn't want to be pregnant. She hadn't. She hadn't wanted a baby until now.</p> <p>"Are you sure we can do it again?" Jim asked. It was the first time he'd said it. She'd been scared but he'd sounded as sure as she could remember in a long time.</p> <p>"God, yes!" she'd finally said and then, "And againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
