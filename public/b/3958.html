"What are you doing here?"</p> <p>Lorraine shrugged her shoulders and replied, "Come on, I've told you that before, you don't need to drive, and I still need to get to work. I won't stay for long. I've got to go." She looked up at me, her eyes misty with emotion. "You'll have to do for me. I could use it now." Lorraine turned and walked toward the door. Her skirt lifted high on her thigh. "Let me get you home before you miss," she added as she turned to leave.</p> <p>"You have no idea how happy I am to have you home today," said the older woman, stepping up to her and offering Lorraine a smile, "you are a sweetie."</p> <p>After she helped me into the car, Lorraine stopped at the end of its driveway. She handed me a box of tissues, and said, "Here you go, you don't need to feel guilty. You have to keep thinking about what happened yesterday. I want you to do everything we did so you can now enjoy the things that I did for you. If you feel guilty about it, you can stop immediately. After what you saw today, you can even take me shopping and buy me a new dress." "You want to buy me a dress again?" I asked.</p> <p>Lorraine smiled and replied, "I wanted you to see what it could do."</p> <p>When we got home, Lorraine had us carry my clothes into the bedroom. It was a large, fancy affair with all the brass and leather furnishings. The bed was a leather four poster, with a single headboard and a single chair in the corner. I was surprised at how sophisticated it was. "Why don't you get a chair like that? If you like, we can put it in the spare room. It'll be quieter in there." Lorraine put me down on the back of the chair. "Just sit on it. It won't hurt us while we are gone," She moved back to the other chair, where there were stacks of clothes in the closet, and began to pick out the clothes.</p> <p>The first pair was black, complete with matching bra and panties. Lorraine was so excited that she pulled on the panties, which felt surprisingly silky. The second pair was white. The black one was obviously not the standard pair, but at least it matched the color of my sweater. The fourth pair was completely opaque, with barely any cleavage visible. The overall look was elegant. I found it difficult to contain my own excitement. Lorraine seemed to be in a constant state of arousal, and didn't want to stop.</p> <p>Lorraine stepped back to let me sit where I was, and looked over the outfit. She came back and handed me the bra and panties, which were clearly soaked with her juices. When she stepped back, we smiled at each other. "I don't think we need this," Lorraine said with a giggle, "my panties really don't match. Just put these on to finish out the outfit."</p> <p>"The panties are for me!" I said, putting on the bra, and then sat back and pulled the panties up my legs. As I adjusted, Lorraine stood and held out her hand with both hands, saying, "I want to do this for you while you are here. I don't want to feel guilty about it."</p> <p>"No, no, no," Lorraine said. "I wanted to try it with you. If you do this, we'll both have a night of wild, uninhibited sexual fun with you. Maybe both of us. It's about feeling good, being naughty, and having some control. It's all about doing what feels right."</p> <p>We held each other as we walked over to the bed, Lorraine on top of me, and a moment later, as I laid down again, Lorraine was on all fours behind me, her ass pointing up at me. She looked over her shoulder and grinned widely. "That's exactly what I was hoping for," she added, "I'm so glad we're here." Lorraine had me lay back against the pillows, but pushed me upwards against them and began to rub her breasts all over me. Even on the bed, she still had that little "accident" that she had when you make love, and I felt her tongue circling my nipples. She leaned to the side and brought her head down and took one of my hands and placed it on a breast. She teased my nipple with her mouth and her tongue. I found it to be very erotic, a sort of dance I knew I couldn't do without. I felt like I had a foot long prick stuck in my groin, in a kind of mechanical dance. Lorraine was moving her bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
