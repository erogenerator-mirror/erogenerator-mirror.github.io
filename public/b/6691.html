He said.</p> <p>"Me too. I'm so sorry it happened... I hope you didn't mind... it just happened?"</p> <p>"You can still forgive me. It probably will be a lot of things."</p> <p>They sat in silence for a long time before Jack spoke again.</p> <p>"Hey, I want you to go and talk to Aunt Sheryl." He said.</p> <p>"I just got out of school, and... well I'm not seeing anyone and I'm afraid I could be alone." She said.</p> <p>"Well, maybe you should call Sheryl and find a time for you to come over and hang." He said.</p> <p>She hesitated for a long time before saying yes.</p> <p>"I want to get my life back on track. I can't say no and I don't want to be alone."</p> <p>"Ok!" He said quickly and then reached out to grab her hand. "Come with me to the back door."</p> <p>"I'm sorry Jack, I think I might have a little alcohol in me."</p> <p>"Well alright then."</p> <p>And they got in the truck. They drove for several minutes and she asked for directions. He drove back to her house and drove around back.</p> <p>When she got to her house they parked and she walked into the living room. She looked around and noticed that he was still in the front room and the lights were off except for a couple of the lamps scattered around the living room.</p> <p>She looked around the room to see if she could find a way to unlock the door, but to her right there was a couple of chairs, a table with several couches, a large couch, four love seats, and a small kitchenette.</p> <p>When she looked back into the living room she saw him sitting there, holding a beer and two glasses. She got up in surprise and almost fell. For the first time in her life she felt weak in his arms. There was fear, rage and lust in his eyes and he held her tightly. They sat in silence for the longest time.</p> <p>When it was safe he spoke.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I... I... I didn't mean to hurt you." He said</p> <p>"Listen Jack, you're not hurting anyone. I love you." She said in a shaky voice as anger reared up inside of him and threatened to consume him.</p> <p>"You think? You can just say no. The only chance that I have of surviving your anger is if you can say no. Just think about it. If I could get you what you are looking for, it would be worth it." He said in a calm voice.</p> <p>And he reached out and squeezed her hand.</p> <p>"Thanks for helping me get the house back on track." He said.</p> <p>"Thank you Jack." She said as she took his hand.</p> <p>"We have other business to take care of." He told her.</p> <p>"That's ok." She said. "We'll see you two later."</p> <p>Before she could say anything more he had closed the door and the lights went on. Jack turned to her and took her in his arms.</p> <p>"So, are you coming over, or is that the wrong thing?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes... I am coming over." She said.</p> <p>"No, no it is not."</p> <p>And he kissed her lips.</p> <p>"Jack, I don't think I can stay any longer." She said</p> <p>"No... don't be silly. You can stay over. I already got out of school and I'm sure you won't be able to get up so you'll only have to stay for a little while."</p> <p>Shocked at her words, the tears were falling down her cheeks.</p> <p>"But... I don't want to come over."</p> <p>"Oh I see... do you think it would be alright to bring the old Jack over and kiss?" he said, with a smile on his face.</p> <p>"Yes, that's it." She said quickly.</p> <p>"Just one more thing, I'll try to keep you, even when you're done with your first marriage."</p> <p>"Jack, wait, maybe you have other ideas." She said as she looked deep into his eyes.</p> <p>"What are you talking about?"</p> <p>"I'm sorry..." She said as she ran her hands through his hair.</p> <p>"It's alright. I'm not saying to kiss you in the mouth." He said, as he held her back against his chest. "I just want you to feel like something really is happening between you and me."</p> <p>"Jack, I can't, not anymore."</p> <p>Before she could answer him that it was true, the lights went off, and they both slept in the guest room.
