I'd just have to go along with it. I love her breasts and so do you. You shouldn't be the only guy who can't do it. She's gorgeous but, well, she's never done it."</p> <p>"Why would she do it if I had to have done it. I guess it just occurred to me. I thought she was very sensitive."</p> <p>"If you ever feel like having someone else do it, let me know and we can try it, sometime."</p> <p>"You're kidding. I'd do her. I wouldn't do anybody," Bill said. He looked at his beer and thought how difficult it would be to see the guy in the car on the way to the airport.</p> <p>He didn't see anything else happen that day. He had seen the guy and watched him. Then to his surprise, he saw Bill leaning over to her to kiss her. His lips closed on hers and he felt his lips touch hers. He was shocked at what he had seen. He thought he saw it in Bill's face too. He thought he saw it on their face. He had never been with a gay man before, did they? He felt like he should leave now and not to be such a total pervert. He really wanted to get it over with. He also wanted to leave this place quickly.</p> <p>"Bill, you're not just there to seduce a girl. That's why you're in this town so early. It's only been a couple of hours and neither was there," she said.</p> <p>Bill saw her thinking about things and was surprised by how he felt. He just stood there. No words were exchanged and Bill was afraid what he might say or do. In his mind, he looked for courage, but found none.</p> <p>"Yeah, he's just there to seduce a girl. You really liked that too? You think I'm handsome that way, eh?" Bill saw the look on his face and saw it in his eyes. But he wanted to give his feelings to her. He wanted to make the most of the first time. He felt so stupid. He didn't understand what made him feel that way.</p> <p>"I...I just..." Bill said in a stunned tone.</p> <p>"I said I like it too. I know there's no one else doing it. But I want us to do it. It'll have an erotic effect on both of us, if that's what you want. I've always thought that, but I don't think I can do it with anyone else right now. I've never been with a straight guy. I'm straight."</p> <p>"We...I don't...know what to say, you know?"</p> <p>"It's just that you seem like such a nice guy. You really want to. I don't mean to pry. I'm just saying that it might work and you're still the most beautiful woman for me to be with."</p> <p>"I'm just thinking the exact same thing as you. What's it like kissing a girl? Does it feel better when I kiss a girl?"</p> <p>"It...It doesn't feel like the same. It's so soft and loving. It's just the way I like it. It's kind of like my first time."</p> <p>"It's not my first time that I'm talking about this," she said in a whisper. "You did something to a girl before you got up to do something else to me, didn't you?"</p> <p>"Yes...I did," he said in a shaky voice. "Maybe you felt like you were falling for me. It's not natural to feel that way. I can't explain it."</p> <p>"You want to. You want to put me in a position to be alone with you that nothing can happen."</p> <p>"I know it can happen. And you want to. It's a natural progression. What's it like?</p> <p>"Okay...I will see if I can find out," Bill said and followed her out to the car.</p> <p>Bill didn't want his new friend to see him at all sexually. He was sure that he could go all the way and make love to her. He knew it might be wrong to do so, but it would have more than just sex. Their relationship couldn't be ruined by all of that.</p> <p>The next day after the first night, she was alone. When she came into town, she wanted nothing else to do. The feeling of intimacy she felt with him was all to her and she wanted to keep that friendship. Bill seemed to have no idea.</p> <p>"Honey, I'm afraid that I have gone too far," she said when he walked inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
