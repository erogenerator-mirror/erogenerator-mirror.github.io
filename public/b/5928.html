Yet I got up, cleaned myself up and got dressed and drove down to the station.</p> <p>I was not sure. Did I do something wrong? Had my son really just done it. He was a good kid, and I had known for a long time that he was not like every other child's boy! I smiled to myself as I realized that he was indeed very innocent, and not just playing with someone's penis! He just enjoyed himself. The thing is!</p> <p>In front of me on my way to the train station, I found myself thinking about my son, and all those feelings that he had, that we had, that he would someday have a girlfriend. I thought that, even if he didn't love me as hard as he once had, in the long run, perhaps he was still looking into my soul as I was doing, knowing that I wanted to let that happen! If the feelings were still there they would be gone in a couple weeks.</p> <p>The feelings of those weeks began very slowly to build, and each step closer to the end was slower, almost imperceptible as the pressure built. I was getting more and more nervous, and the pressure built, and the tension began to set in.</p> <p>After a very long pause, I found that, despite being a very attractive woman, I still was not completely sure that would be the case, at least yet. Maybe just for a few minutes, I thought? Maybe I could make up for my lack of courage. Maybe, just maybe, I could just be patient.</p> <p>As the tension built, more and more insistently, I began to feel as though it would never end. I began to wonder what it would be like to have sex with a man, and if I would want to have that same sex, but it seemed to have an uncertain future. I finally looked into the train's dark eyes, and realized that in my own mind, I wanted to have sex with my own son.</p> <p>It made sense at the same time. I knew that I would, sooner or later, have to say that, do what I was doing, and maybe there would be a chance of a future together. I wasn't going to turn everything that was happening into a joke, just as I had been doing. I would do anything to make this happen, and that wasn't going to be easy.</p> <p>So I drove. I drove. And at some time, all of those moments, I was hoping and hoping that somehow the experience would develop into something that would finally be just the right, gentle thing to do for the both of us. And maybe it would be, at the moment, what our son had truly wanted, and it would be the right thing to do.</p> <p>On the way to the station, I was feeling very, very guilty. I guess my husband, as I have to tell you, was no exception, at that moment. I wasn't looking in his eyes, that is, and I wouldn't have been looking at them if he were looking at my crotch while I had my fingers in my panties. Oh, well, what was the harm, right?</p> <p>I felt as though everyone in my family and friends were looking at me. It was obvious to me, from looking up, that, for the moment, the situation was pretty much the same. My face, in fact, felt more flushed, as though I had been looking at myself in the mirror, and could not believe that I had touched myself. Perhaps that was what I had wanted, for the moment, to avoid the thoughts that were creeping into my mind when I left the train.</p> <p>But it was what I was doing, what I had done, that made me feel guilty. Why I had put myself through that in just a few hours. I had known what the problem was, and it had been that. But I wasn't doing that. I wasn't even thinking about what I was doing for the love of God, and what I was doing for the man who loved me.</p> <p>My mind was racing at the possibilities. I couldn't believe that this would actually work.</p> <p>My thoughts were, I knew, scattered at the corners. I was just making sure that no one else got to that line of thought. And, in spite of my being upset by what happened with my son, I felt that I enjoyed being the only person in the world that knew of it. At first, I did feel a little guilty that I had allowed the feelings to take over me. Maybe it was because of my own husband, but I could not bring that down. At least not now.</p> <p>I kept thinking about what had happened in the last few minutes, and I was a little embarrassed to have even said that out loud. What I was thinking, though, was, that I had not only wanted to experience intercourse with my son, I had wanted toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
