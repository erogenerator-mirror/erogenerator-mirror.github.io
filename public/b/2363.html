Jenny was standing in the bedroom with us on the bed.</p> <p>"How about this," she said as she pulled her t-shirt over her head.</p> <p>"No it's not that," I replied.</p> <p>Jenny pulled off her shorts leaving only the underwear underneath. With her bare backside we stood there naked.</p> <p>"Oh no, don't you!" She laughed.</p> <p>"I want you, now," I said, moving towards her.</p> <p>Jenny had already lay on the bed with her legs open, showing me her beautifully toned body, her breasts topped with erect nipples already.</p> <p>I grabbed my cock and rubbed it up and down over her pussy a couple of times. As soon as I touched her I could feel her start to come.</p> <p>"Don't stop, don't stop, please, please," she cried out.</p> <p>I pushed the head of my cock inside her slowly. "There you go," I cried.</p> <p>For a while we carried on slowly fucking each others bodies, neither of us wanting to release so soon. Then the real fun started. Jenny had pushed her body up and back, raising her leg higher. I moved closer and moved my hands to her inner thighs. For her part Jenny placed her hand back on my shaft, pulling me into her as far as she could go.</p> <p>With each forward thrust I was moving her body in rhythm with my movements. Soon her body began to tremble, her first orgasm beginning to build.</p> <p>Soon I felt her legs tighten around my lower body as her orgasm grew and her wetness flowed down both of our legs, mixing with my own fluids oozing from Jenny's pussy.</p> <p>The pleasure was too much - I too felt the pressure start to build.</p> <p>"Yes! Yes! I'm coming!" Jenny called out.</p> <p>"Oh God, yes," I cried out in her ear.</p> <p>My body tensed and then my cock shot load after load of cum inside Jenny, the two of us writhing and coming in unison. "Wow, that was really good," I said.</p> <p>We fell together as my heart continued to hammer in my chest. We lay quietly as our chests heaved rapidly. It had been a long time and it had been so fucking good.</p> <p>"I have to go to work," I said, as I moved off the bed and stepped into the bathroom.</p> <p>We quickly washed ourselves and each other. I washed the evidence of our lovemaking off my body and put the shower in. I put my pants back on, pulled on shoes and brushed our teeth.</p> <p>"I thought you might want to join us," I said as I gave me a kiss on the cheek.</p> <p>"That's OK," she laughed. "I'm not looking to join my husband again. You are not much of a woman."</p> <p>I moved the shower curtain back, letting the warm water wash clean and give me time to dry myself. I slipped on the robe and left the room. I was going to look into this situation very soon and wasn't sure how I would react.</p> <p>A few minutes later there was a knock on the door. There was no reply so I pulled the curtain shut and opened the door.</p> <p>"Jenny?" I called out.</p> <p>There was no reply but I heard the front door open again, then close.</p> <p>"Hello?" I called, not bothering to put my robe on since I had just stepped out of the shower.</p> <p>"Hello, John. I heard your door open and closed. Is that you?"</p> <p>I looked at the door and shook my head.</p> <p>"Hello, what are you doing here?"</p> <p>"I was just coming in for a cup of coffee. It's a little crowded out here. It's been a long busy day."</p> <p>"Oh, ok," I said. "I've only just got finished with my shower. Shall I come in or do you want to join us?"</p> <p>Jenny entered the bathroom. "Is there any chance I can get a coffee and something to eat? I'm starving!" She said, taking the towel off and handing it to me.</p> <p>"It's no problem. I brought a couple of sandwiches we could share and a bottle of milk."</p> <p>Jenny closed and locked the door before turning me down.
