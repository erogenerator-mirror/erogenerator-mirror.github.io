But you're not really a guy yet, so I really just want to make a friend."</p> <p>I was still pretty buzzed at the prospect of getting the time to play with my new girl friend and get her undivided attention. "I know what you mean, I'm flattered by that, actually. Besides I've been wondering how to get you on board."</p> <p>"If it works with you, I would love to," she said as they began pulling up to a stop. "And I love your cock, though I guess I'm sure it would be a little better than a dildo."</p> <p>I gave her the go ahead sign and helped her get out of the car and I got the key to the front door. We got the door open and she stepped out, and I handed her the key once again, as she stepped into the house. She had set up a light and was pulling off her clothes and I started the water and began the heat in the kitchen, and before long we were getting to the steamy, sweaty beginnings of the afternoon.</p> <p>She was now standing in front of me naked, her large breasts and large nipples pointing straight up in approval. She was looking at me, her eyes twinkling, and I moved a little closer to her so that our chests were barely touching. I was still pretty buzzed at the thought of having sex with a woman, and I wasn't worried about this being our first time.</p> <p>"Let's go outside, I want to be close to you."</p> <p>She just nodded, a little nervously, as she stepped through the doorway. It was not difficult as we climbed out of the tub and dried each other off. I was so excited thinking about what I had to do that I almost went over top while it all happened. I had never been really concerned with the size of her boobs or ass, but she had the body of a Greek goddess and was a very desirable woman. I had never considered myself a big wench, but I couldn't help but be intrigued by her.</p> <p>We had gotten our clothes on in less than a minute and were still just standing at the edge of the tub when we were again in the doorway, her eyes taking in the sight of my now-free dick. She must have seen it, as it stood at half-mast and hard, and I took that as an invitation to step in for a closer look and she stepped aside as I approached.</p> <p>I slid the robe off her shoulders and it fell to the floor of the tub. I looked at her for a minute, and she smiled at me and then turned away to pick it up off the floor. Her body was gorgeous, long and curvy and sexy and sexy and I wanted desperately to give her a few more minutes of attention before I did anything.</p> <p>In the moment that my eyes were locked on her, I felt like a complete stud. She was beautiful. She was tall and slender and her body was fit and sexy. Her tits were small, and her hips were wide enough to show a small patch of hair at her pussy. Her waist was slender and curvy, and her breasts weren't really big by any means, but they looked wonderful in my eyes.</p> <p>As she turned to face me once again, I began to kiss and suck on her nipples and her tongue was moving all over my lips in a very sensual dance. She was breathing harder and heavier now, her hips rocking back and forth as I kneaded her breasts. I pulled her head down towards mine and our lips met. It was a very long kiss, and as my tongue slid into her mouth, I felt her hands on my chest and began to stroke me as we kissed.</p> <p>She broke the kiss with a gasp as my dick was again standing at full mast and just inches from her face. It was as hard as I had been in years, and she looked up at it questioningly. She reached up to take my cock in her hands and then knelt down right in front of me. I reached out to her hips and helped her up so that she could wrap her fingers lightly around the shaft. I reached between her legs to grab hold of her round, round ass as she raised her hips.</p> <p>Her lips and tongue were soft on my stiff flesh as she drew my cock towards her lips. As I kissed her deeply, I slid my hand down her hip and between her legs so that all of my fingers were still wrapped around her pussy. I could feel how hot and wet she was, and I felt her hips bucking and trying to move towards my fingers. My fingers were just barely touching her skin when I felt her hips begin to buck even harder and my fingers began to dig into her flesh as she held onto the wall around me.</p> <p>She wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
