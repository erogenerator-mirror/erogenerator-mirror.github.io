That was a bit of a lie, it made it last longer for me, and her soft, warm mouth felt incredible. I reached up for her breasts under her t-shirt, cupping the firm flesh, tweaking her nipples.</p> <p>"Can I come in? May I?" she looked at me with a devilish grin. I knew what she wanted, and I was happy to give it to her.</p> <p>I stood for her, and she closed the door, the light turned off, then went into the house next door. I went to my bedroom and put on boxers, then opened the door and stepped into the living room. She was standing in her bedroom doorway wearing the same t-shirt she had on the night at the lake, lying on her bed with her legs slightly bent over the edge. A bit awkward. I looked at her for a second, then put my hands on her shoulders and kissed her lightly on the cheek. She looked at me, her eyes flickering down to where my hands rested on her. Her hand rested on mine, and our fingers intertwined. I stood, then kissed her cheek again. I reached down, and began fondling her breasts above the t-shirt.</p> <p>She began to rub her hands over my body, rubbing my chest and stomach, stroking the growing erection at my shorts. I stood there for a second, kissing her lips, tasting the last remnants of sweat on her face and neck. As we kissed, I reached over and undid the button on her shorts, lowering the zipper.</p> <p>Her shorts hit the floor around her feet, and she kicked that away. I moved myself down the bed and began to kiss her body from her ankles to her outer thighs. Soon, the shorts were off, along with her panties, and I kissed and sucked the soft flesh of her thighs as she spread her legs, allowing my tongue access to her private places. I licked the skin of her inner thigh, licking up on the outside, then down the inside of her thigh to the wet spot I had found so far between her legs. Her body shook as my tongue traveled between those lips, and I continued to lick her there. I could hear the wet sounds our saliva made, and smelled that sweet scent which filled the room. As I continued to lick, I slipped my fingers inside her panties, cupping her moist pussy. She sighed, rubbing her fingers across my face, pressing down and gently squeezing my hands as I continued to lick her. I slid my finger to her wet hole, pushing inside gently, moving my wet finger back and forth inside her.</p> <p>She began to buck against my thrusting finger in rhythm with me licking her. I continued to thrust my slick finger up into her pussy and then felt it, she gasped suddenly as a powerful explosion of pleasure swept through her body. Her body relaxed for a second as she began crying, covering my face with her breasts. A shiver ran up her body, her legs began to shake against me as she convulsed against my fingers. Her hips began to move against me, and she moaned my name, her voice barely audible. I continued to kiss her thighs as she calmed down. I stood up before her, her eyes still on mine, and we kissed one final time.</p> <p>"What a wonderful way to start your day!"</p> <p>"Yes, thank you. I'm starved! Take me to breakfast at noon." The words came out as though they were rehearsals. Not my words. My mind went to the events of the day. I knew what I would want to do to her tonight. I found myself sitting on the edge of her bed, one leg outstretched, and leaning back. Her panties had found their way down to her knees, but she didn't seem to notice them. I had no idea how she was doing it, not at all.</p> <p>She sat up, and I saw her face. She was startled, looking at me, then her arms went around me. We embraced in the doorway, sharing a kiss. It was not a passionate one. It was a loving, loving kiss. She had no idea what I was going to do. Was she crazy if she had to come up with a plan to let me ravish her? In my mind, nothing was happening now except what I had planned, or thought it would, but I knew that she was crazy.</p> <p>She moved across the bed, and we kissed again, our lips and tongues entwined. With our legs intertwined, she straddled me, her knees against mine, her thighs against mine. We kissed deeply, our mouths sucking, kissing, sucking. I could feel her hard nipples pressing into mine, and I reached behind to the bedside side table. I grabbed hold of a tube of lubricant from the top of herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
