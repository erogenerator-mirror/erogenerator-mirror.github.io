I said.</p> <p>"No, I mean do you know what you're doing with Tom?" he asked.</p> <p>I nodded and he reached into a bag and pulled out a pair of panties. They were very skimpy and I was so wet I could feel it.</p> <p>"Do you like this, baby?", he asked.</p> <p>"Yeah," I whispered, "it's beautiful; I love the way it fits me very well."</p> <p>I put one of the panties against his cheek so he could smell it, and pulled on the other and then moved him to get in the shower. My fingers ran through his hair as the water washed over us. I lifted his arm and his hand came to the soap. His touch was electric. My eyes closed as I started to lather his back. I pulled his wet hair away from his neck and started to kiss his collarbone.</p> <p>"Tom," I cried out, "I've never...I've loved it, it's so beautiful."</p> <p>This was a different person, and I was not sure how much he could take, so I turned him into his back and my body pressed against his. His body had the feel of satin and his penis seemed to throb between us as I was so close to him. I wanted to feel his body next to hers, but I wanted to feel him inside of me.</p> <p>"Mmm, I don't know what I would do if this did not..." he started to say, but then a tear ran down his cheek. How could I have let my feelings get the better of me?</p> <p>"There is a lot more of you if you want to," I whispered into his ear.</p> <p>And that was when I took hold of his penis. I could feel it through his pants, it felt so hard!</p> <p>"I'm yours," I whispered, and lifted my hands to grasp them. The feeling was incredible and all I wanted to do was make it last. I lowered my lips to his shoulder, his neck, his nipples on my tongue and kissed him again and again.</p> <p>"I was your first," he said, "I didn't even realize..."</p> <p>"I'm the first to make me feel like this," I smiled, "but we just made love." I kissed his lips, his cheeks and his shoulders. I lifted his left arm and licked the tears of his face, which just seemed to be on fire.</p> <p>He had a look of total ecstasy on his face and I had to have him now.</p> <p>"Don't worry," I whispered and kissed his cheek. "I'll make you feel better than you ever dreamed possible."</p> <p>He kissed me back and I felt his penis harden between us.</p> <p>"I'm still afraid," he started a few seconds later. "I'm not sure this is right."</p> <p>"Don't be afraid, please make love to me, John."</p> <p>His kiss turned my breathless body into wild excitement. I felt his lips part and he slid a hand into me. I came. I was so aroused that the sensation of it sent quivering waves up and down my body, and I was panting as he kissed and sucked me.</p> <p>After several minutes I had my fourth orgasm.</p> <p>"My turn," I whispered and slid onto my back, he followed me and slid on top.</p> <p>This was something different and wonderful. Our embrace was so passionate, I was lost in his strong body and the feel of him against me.</p> <p>"Tom," I whispered, "if we do this, it will be only us."</p> <p>He kissed my arm, my shoulder, my neck and the tops of my breasts.</p> <p>"I love you, John," he whispered and slid his lips down to mine, where he made gentle love to my mouth.</p> <p>And after several minutes of kissing and touching, he kissed his way down my body and again moved on top of me. This time he started with his lips only. I felt wonderful, my legs were spread wide and he moved in between them, and started to stroke himself.</p> <p>He moved in and out very slowly, taking him in an endless circle. He would pull it all the way out...my stomach, my ass...my legs, my breasts so gently. I could feel his hardness against me and wondered if he could go any deeper, and if it would make my sex feel different.</p> <p>He kissed my breasts, my ribs and my belly. He slid himself down to my pussy, it felt as if it wanted to grab him and pull him in. I felt as if a small animal had grabbed him. But I didn't care.</p> <p>He kissed around my lips before sliding his tongue in me. I pushed my hips against him and pulledâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
