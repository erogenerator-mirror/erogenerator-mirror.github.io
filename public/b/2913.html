Then she got up in her seat and looked at me.</p> <p>"Maybe I can get you to buy more," she said.</p> <p>"I don't know Lisa ... I don't want to ... what do you know?"</p> <p>I stood up and went to my chair and sat down. As I sat, I looked around. There was a lot of people in the plane that had already boarded and it didn't take me long to get out without attracting any attention. At the end of the aisle, the first flight attendant came over to me and announced to the others that we were leaving the jet for a second time. I quickly found an empty seat.</p> <p>"Can I get you anything?" I called to her. I was surprised by how calm she looked.</p> <p>"That's ok, it's ok. I like to talk," she replied.</p> <p>I was glad that she was on her way back from the bathroom. I started my flight, not saying anything.</p> <p>"Have you ever been to Paris?" she asked.</p> <p>"No!" I said sharply.</p> <p>"Well, we are going to Europe," she said. "I haven't been, and since my sister and her family left here, I don't want to leave. I'm glad we had this weekend, even if there are many things we need to get over."</p> <p>"Me first," I suggested, which she promptly obliged with a big grin. I took the time to take a sip of my drink. After a minute, I could hear the door to the plane go up in the air, and she was walking slowly back toward me. My eyes were closed as I looked at her and I got another smile as she passed the seats to us.</p> <p>She took off her coat and dropped it at the baggage carousel. As she bent to slip the coat off her shoulders, I got another good look at her body. I decided that I knew where she kept everything she had, the shoes, the clothes, the makeup, the glasses - everything. She wore her long auburn hair down and hung straight in a clip, which I had noticed earlier - it was a style I had picked up years before. She was wearing a white blouse and a grey skirt with a long grey plaid skirt. As she bent over to zip up her skirt, I got another chance as her long legs and slim legs were showing themselves a little.</p> <p>I glanced down to see her white panties underneath her skirt. They had a nice lace panel with a thin elastic waistband. I knew, as time had been kind to me, that her underwear were white - if not black - and would match her blouse and dress.</p> <p>"Do you ever buy panties in Europe?" I asked again.</p> <p>"No, you asked," she said with a half smile. "Why?" I laughed.</p> <p>"Come on now!"</p> <p>I took out my wallet, opened it and took out a credit card.</p> <p>"Well, let me see," she said. She stood up and opened her purse. I took out a small white pair of undies with a thin elastic on top and she walked over to me - which I took off. I took one look at them, took it off and then put the panties back on.</p> <p>"Ok. This is really nice," she said. I took the bag from her hands and walked her to the back seat. She sat down as I got in and took the seat back, then reached for the pillow on the passenger seat and spread her legs.</p> <p>"That is more comfortable," she said.</p> <p>She reached between her legs and held her lips apart.</p> <p>I sat on the seat back and she sat up to give me better balance while she sat back and sat on the back of the seat, facing me. She leaned over, spreading her knees, and reached between her legs to touch herself.</p> <p>"This is really nice," she said, reaching for my hand. "It's too bad that this isn't the seat."</p> <p>She reached past her breasts for my hand, and placed my middle finger right on her hardening clitoris and then brought it down to her and put it inside her. She put my palm between her legs and lifted her skirt up to get more room. I pushed my hand deeper, feeling the warmth of her pussy as it opened up against my fingertips. As she got more comfortable, I leaned forward and started kissing her neck and she started breathing hard. She pulled my face in to her chest again as she started to grind her hips back against my hand. It took a few minutes for her to come down, but she didâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
