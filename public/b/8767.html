She felt so dirty and used, and she didn't care she just needed release.</p> <p>Slowly, she spread her legs more, allowing the length of it to pass between her lips. The warmth felt good as it touched her wetness. Sara held still, waiting for a moment to take in what was about to happen.</p> <p>A finger, slipped between them. She felt like a cock slipping through her entrance. The finger began to feel the muscles that would tighten under the pressure, then relax as the finger worked its way into her tightness. With each push she felt it slide further, deeper in and out the finger before disappearing deep inside.</p> <p>This was heaven Sara. She wanted it all the time but she had to have more, to feel it.</p> <p>The finger began to stroke her clit with greater speed, rubbing her clit faster. Sara loved how she felt and wished there was someone else's body doing the pleasure.</p> <p>Sara was panting with lust. She had already begun to orgasm, and this would be heaven. But she didn't move from where she was. She didn't dare to take her hands off the table, she knew what was expected of her. It was time she finished her orgasm so she could concentrate on what she was doing to the finger being deep inside her and what she could do next.</p> <p>Sara was having trouble holding back the inevitable. She tried to control her breathing. She felt like she was going to cum any second and she was scared to touch herself until she got herself under control. That was going to stop when the hand moved from her clit to the middle finger of the other hand, now working at the same time.</p> <p>Sara had never had finger massages before but she was getting used to it and knew the finger did it for her. With the other hand, she slid two fingers up and down her lips. She was very wet now and this felt really good as she stroked in and out. The hand continued to work there while the middle finger slid in and out over and over, sliding in and out and around. The fingers soon added another dimension to the pleasure and it wasn't long before she climaxed again, much louder than before.</p> <p>Sara came hard and long lasting, she couldn't believe that this would happen. Then the finger stopped, leaving Sara with what could only be a mind blowing orgasm. After about five or ten seconds, she relaxed onto the table; her body shivering from the intense pleasure. That's when the hands left and removed all of her hair.</p> <p>Sara looked around to see what all the fuss was about so she lifted her head.</p> <p>"Oh my god John," she said, as she stared at the door leading out in the front of the shop.</p> <p>"You look beautiful!" said John. She was now standing beside her. "That was absolutely amazing."</p> <p>"That was wonderful, John". Sara stood there trying to act like a professional; hoping that her boss would think her words were alluding to something they wouldn't understand.</p> <p>"Why don't you go in and get your things, then come back here with me."</p> <p>"No, please, John. We're so out here. I can't do this to myself." Sara felt she was about to cry again. She felt like she was going to throw up. It wasn't the first time something happened to her but it was the first time someone had done whatever they wanted to her. She was so very scared and had never felt so vulnerable before. It made her feel good about herself. "Please, please John, can you go back there?" Sara said desperately.</p> <p>"It's a deal Sara. Follow me."</p> <p>Sara walked towards John, her head down and her hands still holding her hair, hoping she didn't feel so bad. She took a deep breath to calm herself, and then headed back to see if she could handle the second part of what was going onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
