In the past, whenever I went off with one girl I might feel jealous or a bit jealous, but I wasn't that way. In fact, I still loved her for her beauty and charm. She was also a real knock out for her long blonde hair. It usually matched the black dress I'd been wearing last night. When she gave me a little girl hug, her long hair bounced around on her shoulders.</p> <p>After that night, I came to understand why I came to that conclusion.</p> <p>I could go out, pick a guy for bed, and I'd have sex all night long.</p> <p>So in a way, what had happened last night wasn't really bad. It was definitely not as bad as the first time. I don't know to this day who it had been. I could just say that my mind went all day and never knew why. But no matter. That night was one of the best nights of my life. I'd fucked her again, and I would again fuck her.</p> <p>I felt a lot better afterwards. I didn't cum, though, and I went back to the dorm room and did have sex for hours, but there just weren't enough orgasms in both of us to make up for the lack in quantity.</p> <p>After that, though, that first time was always good for me. I was happy. Maybe it was because I started to find girls more attractive than I was. I mean, girls were just too ugly and gross and it was okay for me to hang out with them. But it was really good to be able to have sex with girls and I was happy that I could. Then, a month later a guy came along who I'd picked up out of the crowd to pick up.</p> <p>"Hi, I'm John" he said.</p> <p>"I'm Cindy" I said. "And this is Mark."</p> <p>"Mark is good to meet you at last." He said. "He's just turned 18 and I hope to be able to spend as much time with him as I can. It's just that the last time I went out with a guy was with his father in Texas. So when I see you it's been an experience like I never had. It's about time that I came home to my family and have my own place to go for as long as I want."</p> <p>"What's this home for? I thought it was for my mother."</p> <p>"No. It's my mom's house."</p> <p>We sat there for a moment, trying to figure out what to say next. We both knew that we weren't going to do this forever because, like it or not, we weren't going to go in together. We both wanted our first time together to be special and not just for me. We both wanted our first time together for us to be about us. How could we make that happen? And how was going to accomplish that?</p> <p>I was sure that the whole concept would be just a little bit silly, but I couldn't help feeling that there was no way. I mean, what would happen when we got married. What would people think? What would society think? It wasn't just me. I just didn't know how to make this thing work. And I wasn't sure that I wanted it to. It was something else.</p> <p>"Cindy, I don't know what I was hoping to do. I'm just doing it because we're both trying to make a baby."</p> <p>"Well. I guess all you're waiting for is to act on an impulse. So what about, say, having sex with other people. It's not cheating. You know."</p> <p>"I know. Well, I guess that I just haven't had any experience with a guy."</p> <p>I didn't care that it was cheating, but why wasn't I telling him something that wasn't true? I decided to let things go where they had to. I wanted to find out what kind of relationship he was willing to have with himself.</p> <p>"But, Mark, you're my son and I love you, so why can't we just have it our way. And anyway, I wouldn't be your mother."</p> <p>He looked at me for a bit, then went over to the kitchen table and started to open the bag. Then he made his way back out.</p> <p>"Cindy, I really don't have any idea what to do. I think that I've just thought out all my options. Maybe, just maybe, we could just go our separate way."</p> <p>I decided to let this thing go.</p> <p>"Cindy, I know a guy that works at the same place as you and I know that it's right by his name. I know that there's no reason to stay in this situation. I know that there isâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
