"I don't think I did this a week ago with those guys you were with," she said, her heart racing. How do you know you didn't have to do this? she wondered. It was one thing to feel good about it, it was something else to feel sorry for herself.</p> <p>"I can be mean when I want to," he smiled with delight, "but I like to be mean when I'm with my girlfriends," he explained.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'll be mean when I'm with my girlfriends," she smiled, suddenly feeling a bit shy. She tried her best to keep her mind on the conversation and not look like she was feeling awkward, and to keep it light, she looked over at him with a half-hearted smile. She felt his eyes on the backs of her eyelids under her light jacket as she lay on top of him.</p> <p>"I can't imagine being like this when we get home," she said thoughtfully.</p> <p>"You don't have to be like this with me, but it's nice to see you," he said, "it means I can be kind to you too and it means I can treat you the same way."</p> <p>That made her blush again and she smiled a little as she said, "thanks."</p> <p>"How come you don't always come to me when I do this," he asked. Her face turned into a smile of frustration as she started to realize what he meant. He laughed lightly when she looked at him.</p> <p>"I don't know what I'm supposed to do." She said.</p> <p>"Just lie back and enjoy it," he replied.</p> <p>She smiled, she'd never done that with a guy before. How many guys do you have to share that with?</p> <p>"Well, I've never been with a guy."</p> <p>"Well you're new around here," he said.</p> <p>"I'm still new around here."</p> <p>"Yeah, well I'd never come out for you," he said, "I've only been in a couple of guys. I've had my share of chicks in my time though. I've had a handful of guys in college. You can see the difference," he said with a wink and a shrug.</p> <p>"No, I mean... I can't exactly call this relationship an 'boyfriend' and 'girlfriend'. I mean you know, you're different," she said slowly.</p> <p>"Different? Sure, you have a certain way of making me comfortable," Mr. Smith said. When she was finished he leaned forward to kiss her gently on the lips, "And you're really nice," he grinned.</p> <p>"Thanks," she said and then smiled when he leaned toward her.</p> <p>"It's just I've never had a girlfriend," he said. "I like to get my hands on you," he said.</p> <p>"But I'm not a girl," she said softly with a smirk.</p> <p>"Sure you are," he said, "so you're a girl... and I'm not a girl either."</p> <p>"Sorry... I just don't usually go with guys like you," she said.</p> <p>"Well if you don't want to fuck me then you can just tell me," he said, "I'm sure we could do it."</p> <p>"No," she said, "I mean, it's been... well actually, it was quite mutual," she said a little nervously.</p> <p>"Sure," he said.</p> <p>"It's not that I don't want to... It's just that... well there's always been a sort of a 'we're not going to get along.' That's all," she said, "and it never really came up."</p> <p>"Well I suppose there's no harm in being honest," he said.</p> <p>"Yeah," she said and smiled.</p> <p>"So why are you here with me," he said.</p> <p>"It's just that I haven't had a boyfriend in my time. You know, like before college," she said again.</p> <p>"That's different. I mean you're different. A guy will always like you, and I don't think you'll have to do this to keep a relationship going," he said.</p> <p>"Well you'd still like this to be something serious wouldn't you?"</p> <p>"I don't know, you don't seem like the type. I just want to be with a guy, that's all."</p> <p>"Well maybe that's one way of making it clear you're different," Mr. Smith offered.</p> <p>"That depends," she said, "as long as you're making out, it doesn't make me out."</p> <p>He laughed at her, "well just keepâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
