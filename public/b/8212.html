You're the one doing him. You're the one with the power, and it has to have been taken from you. Go get it, and get the money to pay for the loan. You don't know shit either. You don't even know which of the two things I'm telling you to do that I'm lying. You're not coming back here anymore and you're going nowhere.</p> <p>"I have an idea we can use. Get the money from you and make the most of it. We would love to see your eyes dilate so much it will take more than your muscles to work. Go get your money, and come back and find out what your problem is."</p> <p>I took her arm and pulled her back. She fell to her knees and cried. I was going to give in.</p> <p>"Don't you dare. You're the one who will be begging me to save your life. I'm telling you I'll be watching you die. Don't you dare make another enemy of me. If you have to die, then you did what you're supposed to have done. Your body will be nothing more than a piece of trash."</p> <p>She looked back up at me and started to say something. I grabbed her by the arm and jerked her up, forcing her to look up at me.</p> <p>"Don't," I said, "I'm being a smartass right now. You will tell me anything I want."</p> <p>She looked back down at my cock and nodded. I reached over and wrapped my fingers around her wrist and forced her hand down to her lap.</p> <p>"You will do exactly as I say," I said. "If you don't, I'll make it very clear that you won't come back into my life again. Is that understood?"</p> <p>She nodded. I had no doubts that she would do everything I told her. She smiled and got up, still facing the door, and walked out. I stayed there for a moment and let the tension out. I waited a few seconds until she was gone and then looked at the clock radio. I checked the time on the radio, got up and went to the window I had set up in front of it.</p> <p>I turned on the radio.</p> <p>"Ten minutes ago. We have a little time. Go get your money and come back to me. I am looking for you. Go! Now."</p> <p>I got up and pulled the door open. I walked in, locked the door and shut the blinds. I walked through the room and came back to her. I took hold of her shoulders and turned her to face me. I was pleased I had managed to not break any of her resolve. I pulled back the chair from where it sat and sat her on it. I reached up and took her hands and pulled her down onto the floor. I could feel her tense against the cold of the rug when I did, and her body froze as I pressed my body against hers.</p> <p>I looked her in the eyes. I still had hope of knowing what I asked was going to happen to her. I needed a little time to analyze things and make myself presentable.</p> <p>"My name is Kevin. I can tell you, you will think me silly. I told you the first time you saw me I was going to be your new friend."</p> <p>I turned and walked out the door, leaving her there on the floor. I went up to the top floor and turned on a few lights. I found a small apartment, which was really great for business and would have suited me well. I took out the key and opened the door. It was unlocked. I went inside.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I didn't warn you," she said, "But there is no telling if you want to keep working on the loan right now, or whether you will."</p> <p>I turned around and looked straight at her, "I'll never work on a loan. I promise."</p> <p>I walked out the door and walked back to my car. As I was driving, I decided to call in for a break. I had another set of keys inside of them, and I had the chance to do that again.</p> <p>I went down the road, found another one. I followed it and parked in the parking garage.</p> <p>I got my car out and walked over to the front door. I knocked and waited.</p> <p>"Come in," she said.</p> <p>My heart started beating in my chest. I went to the door. I knocked again, and heard her let the keys fall to the ground.</p> <p>"I'm glad you aren't here. My husband isn't around, so you could leave it to me."</p> <p>"I would never leave a chance like that.
