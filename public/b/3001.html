I was in tears and I didn't have much time to spare. I looked over at Julie and she smiled a little and leaned over and kissed me again. I couldn't take any more. I reached up and took hold of her breasts and pushed back as my body trembled and my orgasm took hold of me. I collapsed onto my bed and sobbed.</p> <p>While I was lying there with her breast still in my hand and crying, Julie started to slowly stroke my semi hard cock from top to bottom. She was still stroking my cock and slowly moving her hand up and down my hard shaft! It felt wonderful.</p> <p>"I love you, Dave," she whispered, "but not just for that."</p> <p>"Julie, I want all the time," I said, "I want you in every hole I can get you!"</p> <p>And she said it again with a kiss as she slowly began to stroke my cock.</p> <p>"I'm going to have lots of men in bed," she said with a mischievous smile, "I'm going to start off slowly and make myself cum and then work on men I don't know and get them hard with me doing all the work!"</p> <p>She was looking at me intently as she stroked my cock and I moved over to her and reached down and took her hand and kissed her, pushing her down on her bed.</p> <p>I lowered myself between her legs and she reached her arms around my neck, pulling my lips down to hers. Our tongues swirled together and I began to kiss her, running my tongue gently back and forth and gradually working up to her lower lip. I moved my tongue back down and lightly grazed the tip of her tongue. My lips met hers and I could smell the wonderful smell that her mouth and neck had. She lifted her face and kissed me back as I kept kissing her slowly and lightly. I slid my tongue into her mouth and she started to explore it and respond. We were still for a short while but we were getting more aroused as our kisses grew more passionate.</p> <p>I pushed Julie gently back on the bed and she let me move in between her legs. My mouth and lips found hers again as she opened to my tongue and she groaned as my tongue found the sensitive spots inside. We started to kiss deeply as her hands began to caress my head and she pulled my face close to her and pushed back against me. I could feel her fingers running through my hair and I pulled back then pushed in.</p> <p>Her moaning was getting higher and I could feel her hand tightening in my hair, holding my head so I was forced to keep pace with her.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh!" she moaned. "I'm almost there."</p> <p>My lips left hers and I slowly pressed my tongue back into her mouth and she quickly got the message and pulled me down on top of her. Our kiss was almost frantic now and she kept pulling me in and thrusting up at me, making me hard again. She put her hands on my chest and pushed me away and said, "I want you to fuck me good. Make me cum!"</p> <p>I couldn't argue. I pushed her legs forward on my shoulders and slipped between her legs as I positioned my cock so it was at the entrance to her hot wet pussy. I could feel the heat emanating from her sex as she reached with two hands to press my body down on hers. She was very turned on and I moved into her as she pushed me back. I took hold of her buttocks and pulled her hips towards me as I thrust forward. Our bodies were wet but we took it in stride and we groaned as we rocked together.</p> <p>Julie started to moan loudly with each thrust and her hips were moving in time with mine, moving the full length of my cock deep inside her. I could feel her pussy tighten around me as she moaned and I did it again and she groaned. Our bodies were moving in rhythm now and I could feel her orgasm running through her body, it was hard to tell exactly how much she was enjoying it or how many times it was affecting her, because what I felt was hard to say. We were both working to match our bodies and I kept thrusting into her. I looked over her shoulder and her head was looking at me as I thrust into her again and again and again. After several minutes she cried out again and I felt her pussy contract as her climax surged through her body.</p> <p>We kept right on going, pumping each other, making love. It didn't take long for her to climax again and I could feel her wet pussy spasm as her hot juices oozed through the crack of her ass. She was making unintelligible noises with each thrust. I couldn't hold it anymore and my cock started to spurt my semen inside her hot wet pussy as Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
