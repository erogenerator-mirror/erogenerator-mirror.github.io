"But right now I'm just a little lonely and horny."</p> <p>He moved closer, almost touching. She let him. There was no hurry here. Neither of them had the need for a fight. He moved his hand under the jersey and cupped her sex. She felt his penis, stiff as steel by now as he moved between her legs.</p> <p>"Take the jersey off" she huskily whispered, pulling up the jersey. She was sitting on the bed in just panties. Her hair was pulled out from her head with a soft fringe falling over her eyes and into two wavy waves.</p> <p>"That's better. I think it's better than you'd be thinking at all. You sure I don't look bad?"</p> <p>"You look pretty alright, but you're not really me."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm not, really."</p> <p>They were on the bed in a half-naked embrace. She was leaning back on the bed, her face to his feet, her legs straddling his. His penis was resting between her legs on his stomach, just outside her vagina. "Come on," she said, grabbing his penis and dragging it over her slit. "I need it in me."</p> <p>Tom got up on his knees, pressing his penis against her vagina, sliding in a little, then pulling it out a little before pushing it back in. Her vagina was slippery as it wrapped around his penis. There was a wetness there, she didn't think he had ever had anyone this wet before.</p> <p>"Oh God, Tom. That's so good."</p> <p>It got her feeling warm and tingly with his penis sliding in and out of her pussy. Tom's penis was so stiff that the tip of it was rubbing against the outside of her clit. She was feeling like she would cum again if the tip of his penis rubbed her clit this way. Her vagina was so wet that her vagina lips were pressed against his penis, his pubic hair scraped against her vagina. He held himself still inside her, not moving, not moving at all, just enjoying the sensation of entering to a new level in their relationship.</p> <p>"Just keep moving," she said, her voice full of emotion as she moved, feeling his penis as it slid in and out of her vagina. "You need to hold your penis inside me. I feel so filled."</p> <p>Tom just did. He leaned forward and rested an arm on the bed behind her. He could feel her legs against his back too. He could feel where his penis had come from just inside her.</p> <p>"Tom, I'm so happy right now. I feel so glad that we're doing whatever makes our relationship right."</p> <p>Tom was still sitting, sitting up on her thighs, but he moved back, sitting back again, looking down at her with that same emotion in his eyes. He leaned forward again and brushed his lips across her forehead.</p> <p>"You don't look like you've just had a good fuck," he said.</p> <p>Tom's lips touched hers again. They were soft. His lips were full. The mouth on her mouth was so soft and warm.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm not doing this at all," she said. But her tone left no part of her voice that she was going to say the things that she was going to say, and she was going to say them right at him.</p> <p>"No you aren't, not at all. I love it when you say things like that. You shouldn't be thinking like that. You are the most beautiful woman that I've ever met. All I can think about is you. How you're going to look at me now after this night. I'll see you tomorrow."</p> <p>He started to pull his cock back out, but she placed her hand between their bodies, pushing it back in. She was pulling at it, urging it back out, making it feel that way again. She wanted to see it, to feel some of the hardness of it. She wanted so much to feel his weight on her as both of them were on their backs, with her legs stretched out wide, her feet pressing into the bed of pillows.</p> <p>She was getting wetter. It was beginning to feel so good.</p> <p>He started to pull his penis out of her vagina again. She pushed harder into him.</p> <p>"Honey . . . what . . ." he started.</p> <p>"Just let go." The words were coming out her mouth this time.</p> <p>Just let me feel it, Tom whispered into her mouth. It's okay, honey, just let go. It's a lot to bear. Just let it go.</p> <p>She didn't have any objection to that. Maybe the kiss was only a kiss, but she couldn't help herself. She didn't need any more encouragementâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
