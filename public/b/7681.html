You know, we could do that in front of the kids"</p> <p>I said, "Okay, I guess so. Oh what's she do to make a guy do such terrible thing as a date with a girl?"</p> <p>Sara shook her head and said, "Oh no. I mean, I'd just keep doing what I was doing!"</p> <p>"What?" I said.</p> <p>"My dad would do it if we went to a nude beach. I'd look like you."</p> <p>"No, not nude beach! We're married!"</p> <p>"Yes the beach is a nude beach. What about that bikini?"</p> <p>"That's okay. She might as well do it."</p> <p>"What bikini?"</p> <p>"Oh," is that a bad thing?"</p> <p>I had my head back so I could listen but didn't see why Sara would ever want to do this. I said, "Sara, why would you want to go to a nude beach?"</p> <p>She shook her head and said, "I want to go to the nude beach and maybe get back at my brother. Isn't a lot of stuff wrong with that, when you mean it?"</p> <p>"Okay, but I don't want anything happening between us."</p> <p>Sara gave me a worried look and said, "You don't have to lie to me. You didn't say anything about what you meant by it when you said we could go to a nude beach."</p> <p>I looked up and she was looking at my breasts again but she didn't seem concerned with our date.</p> <p>"Oh Sara," I said, "That's a big one for me!" I took her face in my hands and put one of my fingers on her lips.</p> <p>She opened her mouth and I leaned forward and kissed her. The kiss was passionate and hot and I could taste her on my lips. We broke the kiss.</p> <p>We sat there for what seemed like hours, while I looked around nervously, at my friends, and at my parents.</p> <p>I looked at Sara as I leaned back over the arm of the sofa. We both had our eyes closed, and she was holding my hand tightly around, as if she was afraid to let go.</p> <p>The next afternoon we went to dinner. Sara had brought some of her suitcases, to help. During the wait, I found her and our mom in the bedroom. My dad, looked up from watching the news, and our mother was in the middle of changing into something she picked up and put in a bag, near the dresser.</p> <p>Sara spoke first as she came to me and kissed me lightly on the lips.</p> <p>"Hi honey, where's your suit?"</p> <p>"Just my bikini," I said.</p> <p>"My suit?"</p> <p>I nodded my head. I didn't know what else to say but Sara seemed to be holding it.</p> <p>"We've got to go. You go to your sister for a shower, I'll make us some lunch."</p> <p>Sara left a little while later. I hadn't noticed that she wasn't alone with me.</p> <p>My dad came over when Sara came out. He sat across from us and I thought he might be angry. At first I tried to figure it out. We all had something to eat and the girls were not there. Dad made a salad and we all sat at the dinner table and talked about family and friends and the rest of it.</p> <p>Dad asked a lot of questions. I said I didn't know so I let the subject drop.</p> <p>After dinner Dad said, "I'm going to put the steaks on the grill."</p> <p>"Okay, Mom."</p> <p>We sat around the dining table with him in the middle of the living room talking. He wasn't drinking but I knew he had some. We enjoyed our meal and talk.</p> <p>Sara came home an hour later in the living room with dad and her arms around him. It was pretty quiet so Sara had no time to talk to them.</p> <p>I got up and put on some shorts and a halter-top dress, just for show. I saw Dad watching me and he was smiling at me, too.</p> <p>"Don't you think Sara had a nice time? I mean, I know it's been great. You're the only one she's seen naked so far."</p> <p>My dad grinned at me. "Yeah, she likes to sunbathe naked!"</p> <p>I said, "Yeah, but that wouldn't be fair to her if she was naked in front of her brother. I mean, she's your twin, right?"</p> <p>Dad just grinned and said, "Yeah, that's a little unfair! I'm sure you're looking, too. Well, when she came home from the mall. She was naked except for a bikiniâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
