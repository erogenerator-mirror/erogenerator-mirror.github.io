"It would be really nice to feel you inside me. Don't go far. Just try it and see how it feels, if you get it right. And when you're ready, just try and hold still for now."</p> <p>He tried. His eyes were still glassed in fear. He could feel her heart beating against his back and there was no way he could avoid the pain. He nodded and she guided him inside her. He was not surprised to feel her warmth enveloped him. It was too much. He had to have something inside of him to make it feel better. He lifted his hips and felt her relax again. He felt his head moving deeper. He started to move slowly.</p> <p>A moment later, she was breathing hard and his hips began to thrust. He knew what she wanted and he wanted badly to try. He thrust deeply and felt his head hit the g-shaped of her cervix. With his mind clouded with his love for her, he had no control. He didn't care how it felt. He loved her, adored her. He had to have it inside of her. So he thrust harder. She responded with thrusts of her own.</p> <p>He felt a burning sensation starting to rise from his hips. He thrust in and out faster, faster. He moved a little harder and his hips slammed her. His eyes started to burn. And to him, it was like an aftershock. It felt like nothing had happened but he didn't care. The pain was gone, replaced by a burning feeling in the pit of his stomach, a wave of pleasure passing through him.</p> <p>He was gasping. Her cries as she came in his arms were like music, too loud, too loud. Tears ran down his cheeks and his tongue felt like it had been in her mouth and he could not breathe.</p> <p>They lay there for a time. His chest and stomach heaved as he fought to regain his breathing. When he did, she rose up and slowly turned around, her chest rising and falling as she did. He looked down as her face changed from a cute smile to a serious expression. She raised her arms, offering herself to him.</p> <p>He bent down and kissed her lips and felt her trembling beneath him. They lay like that for a time, neither moving at all. "I love you, you know, Jaimie," he whispered as he kissed her forehead, her cheeks. He wanted to tell her now, but instead he just held her as he slowly withdrew his cock from her. Once he felt she was ready, he moved slightly forward and felt the small hole, with his head, pop inside her to feel the pressure and heat of his head. It felt as if he was going inside of her. He felt the walls of her pussy around him as he pushed slowly.</p> <p>"Please," she whispered and he whispered something back. In the same way his mouth said, "Go slow," his whole body moved as if he were dancing. He felt her move slightly, and his thrusting turned more aggressive and forceful. He felt as if he could go deeper and deeper than he ever had before. His hips began to pound as he fucked her with all of his weight and strength. Faster and faster. "Yes," she cried out, "yes," she begged him with words. He fucked her with all of his strength for what seemed like hours. "God yes," she cried in his ears. She felt her orgasm building. She clutched him hard in her arms. "Yes, yes, yes! Yes!" She yelled as a second, more powerful orgasm shook her body. "More," she cried out. "So good," she said as she thrust her hips against his thrusts.</p> <p>They moved slowly. Gradually, he got faster, harder. "Oh, god yes" she moaned as her pussy squeezed him, so tight. She felt another, more powerful orgasm come on. She felt the wetness on her lips. This time, the orgasm exploded her body and she screamed as she felt the warmth and wetness against her thighs. "Wow!" she cried again after a long time. "Wow!" She cried again as her body continued as he pulled out and pushed it back in again.</p> <p>He was fucking her hard now. She loved it and they felt the hot fluid from his cock against her insides. They moved together like a couple of wildcats, with the loud animal sounds of their love making the last few minutes from that point. "God!" she thought, "he's so good." Her eyes closed as she went through the first couple of minutes of coming. She felt like a wild cat at the peak of her orgasm as he continued to thrust and slam her body.</p> <p>He had never had such excitement. It was almost like an itch that he was never going to be satisfied.
