I pulled my shirt back on and checked. My shirt was tight and she looked good in it, so I figured I could keep her from wearing it in the same way. I zipped my clothes back up and leaned against her, giving her a bit of an extended hug before we parted.</p> <p>"I'd like to be your friend," she whispered, her hand still holding mine.</p> <p>"I would, too," I whispered back, as I closed my arms around her and felt her warm embrace.</p> <p>"Thank you," I said.</p> <p>I let her hold my hand for a very long moment and then I turned away and went to sit down on the corner behind the bar, and she followed immediately. "Why are you looking at me?" she said while she sat down, her expression serious.</p> <p>"I don't want to be bad," I told her. "You're a good looking women. We have a lot in common." I wasn't going to make it an easy conversation.</p> <p>"Me too. Just, uh, just being honest with myself about it." She reached out and took my hand again. "It's been a while, but I enjoyed it."</p> <p>"Me too," I said, remembering how much of a mess I have gotten my mouth on her the time we had been fucking. I couldn't decide what to say or do next. "I'm going to call it a night."</p> <p>"I could use another drink," she offered. "Thanks for the ride," she said, walking into the lobby.</p> <p>I went back into the shop and found myself sitting on my couch for a couple more minutes just thinking about how much work I had put into this. This would have to be an experience I couldn't back down from. It was going to take a lot for me to stop, but I didn't.</p> <p>The waitress returned with my drink and when she asked me if it had been worth waiting for, I told her it was, and she smiled. The waitress finished with the transaction and took my order and left the door open.</p> <p>"Well, we really enjoyed tonight. Don't give me too much credit," she said with a little grin. Then she gave me this wicked glace and went into her office. She came back a while later with a small tray and two glasses and sat the tray down next to the couch. She put the tray down next to my chair and smiled her devilishly wicked smile again.</p> <p>"So, tell me about this room," she said, glancing over the wall, and her grin widened.</p> <p>I sat down next to her and reached over to rub her shoulder. I could feel the tension from the evening's exertions seeping into me and I sighed happily at the memory of the night before. I pulled on my shirt as she slipped her arms into mine and rested her head on my shoulder.</p> <p>"Tell me what happened tonight."</p> <p>"Nothing much," I said, "just watching a movie again. I found it pretty good, and then some. The movie was kind of funny, but at the end it was just sort of fun."</p> <p>She gave me another sexy smile, and then turned her face up to me, smiling. "How about you?"</p> <p>"Well, I'm just sitting here with my drink. And, it was kind of fun, too. I couldn't keep my hands off you."</p> <p>She just looked at me without saying anything for a couple seconds, then leaned over to take my drink. Her mouth was inches from mine and her eyes were still smoldering, and it was obvious she wasn't going to let us do this again.</p> <p>"It was so nice to be with you," she finally said. "And, you know, we really are really good friends, right? You're the first guy I've gone out with on Valentine's Day...with a date. But, I don't know, maybe we should talk about it, sometime."</p> <p>I gave her a little smile and then looked over for her next question.</p> <p>"You and Mike had a fight last night, huh?"</p> <p>"No, not really," she said. "He's my boyfriend. And I know all the wrong people. I guess I'm still really upset about it, and I just think - I don't know, maybe this is all a terrible thing to be saying, but - " she said, but I wanted to know more, not because she was just trying to make me feel better or something, but if she was just trying to keep me from telling her about it."</p> <p>I just nodded and let my eyes drift over to the window to just watch the snow fall and the snow man in front of the store.
