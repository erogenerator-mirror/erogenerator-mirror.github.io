Sure, I loved to think about it, watch videos, even watch TV together, but even though I'd heard it was wrong, I never thought that women would actually like to do so. I didn't have the courage to ask her to do it either, but in the end, there it was, and I figured that it would be fun and right at the same time. My wife had always said that I wasn't ready to try to be with men. So while I never took it seriously, being with a woman would be fun. I'd always wanted to try it myself, but now, I'm afraid to ask.</p> <p>I'd been doing this for the past 3 weeks, and there was no way to tell if I was doing this for someone else. I figured that since I really enjoyed the sex, it just might seem weird to ask but even though I wasn't sure, I'd make mistakes. Plus, I thought maybe it would be nice to kiss a girl if she offered. She usually said that she was too afraid but I never got into it. The girls I'd been with had always wanted to kiss a girl. I was pretty good at it, and once you get the hang of it, your tongue is a lot longer than your dick is.</p> <p>I pulled the chair over a place, facing a window, with a book by my ear, and pulled the blind up slightly to keep in sight of everyone else in the room. At some point, there was a sudden clapping and everyone in the room heard a voice that said something like, "Lucky bastard!" I turned around, looking down my shirt as I did, and then looked over my shoulder at the girl with the big smile on her face. She was a tall dark-haired girl with beautiful brown eyes. She looked very much like me, except she was a bit taller. She wore a short pink skirt, and a white blouse. It was obvious that she was wearing a bra underneath, as her nipple poked out over the top in small red circles. She had a flat belly. Her boobs were maybe an A cup, and her nipples were a little too big for the small frame of her blouse and her small, but pretty pink nipples were a little too big for the thin confines of her blouse, and her little blue nipples were almost completely visible beneath the cotton fabric. This blouse, in particular, was much too small for her. I looked down into her eyes, and they were sparkling, and there was something about her beauty that made me want to kiss her for real.</p> <p>After a few moments of this, I continued the questioning of her for a while, and she didn't say anything, just gave a few small touches to her hand. As I did, we shared a knowing look as we both leaned forward and kissed one another softly on the lips. This new kind of touch from her made me feel so alive. It was like an explosion from that moment on, and it was so perfect. We had gotten to feel each other's mouth and lips on hers, our kissing becoming more intense and passionate. It looked like we were kissing with our tongues. At the same time, we both reached for each other's cheeks and pulled us together. I could feel those little beads of pre-come on my fingers, and it was like this little moment forever as we kissed.</p> <p>Finally, we broke apart at long last, our lips just touching. As we said hello, she went to a drawer on the closet door and pulled out two big glasses. She set them on the table as if in front of each of us, then walked over and leaned on her elbow towards me. Our eyes met, and there was no hesitation on either of our faces. She reached up to kiss me on the cheek, then her lips came to mine, and I responded, our lips feeling electric tingles racing through our bodies.</p> <p>As we kissed, our hands were already on each other. I loved touching her, touching her everywhere, feeling it under her clothes. I was still holding her, holding onto her breast when she reached to put her hand on mine, and she lifted it and placed it over her own mound. We kissed again, our hands exploring each others body, both feeling how hard her nipples were and rubbing it. Once I touched her and she touched me, I turned my head and pushed my tongue into her mouth, and our lips pressed together, passionately. I pulled my hand away first, and she pulled me back to her, but held my head with both hands, my tongue still pressing into her mouth.</p> <p>Then we broke our kiss, and she ran her hand along my leg and up to my hip. "John, we are going to have to go to a movie. I guess it's my turn nowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
