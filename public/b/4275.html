He pressed firmly, pushing her forward, his tongue leaving her mouth to taste herself, as her hands slid down to her own thighs, to her knees and then her feet, to the floor. His tongue left her wetness, leaving her breathless again and she sighed as it again found it mark. His fingers pulled her body up so they were standing at about an arm's length apart. Lifting her hips, he pulled her panties down, exposing her glistening pink lips. With a low moan, he tasted her, opening to welcome his tongue. He found her entrance and moved one finger in to slide it back in to her heat. She groaned as she felt him slide her apart and push his tongue hard, fucking her with it. Her hips bucked as she felt herself open further in response and a moment later, she had to have him inside, she had to feel him inside her.</p> <p>He was big, long and thick, his body hard and powerful. He was as she would love to feel his lips pressing against her breasts and the feel of him against her body. And the sensation was as good as she had ever imagined. Her nipples were hard, swollen and pressing against his chest and they ached in reaction to his touch. He teased, licking and nibbling and before long, she had to feel him deep inside her, and she cried out as her orgasm burst through her and she came.</p> <p>"God John, I can't take this." she said against her lips, her hips lifting to bring him deeper inside her with the next thrust. His eyes closed and he groaned loudly, his own hips bucking. Her body arched from its own release as she felt him move inside her, his hands grasping at her thighs, pulling her further onto him, taking her completely. "Yes John, cum in me, I want to feel you cum in me again, I want to feel you fill me again." His eyes shut, his arms wrapped around her body as he thrust deep and hard. His voice a soft groan of satisfaction, as he pulled himself free, she could feel the heat, the thickness, as her clit pressed against it.</p> <p>"Are you ready to do me now?" he asked huskily from behind her. She nodded, trembling again with anticipation. She felt his fingers press against the entrance to her hole and she gasped at the pressure. The sensation was intense and overwhelming to her and she knew she could not take any more.</p> <p>Standing beside the bed, he turned her around and lifted her onto it. She cried out again as her shoulders were pushed against the wall. He entered her gently, holding on to her body so he would not withdraw, letting her feel him fill her.</p> <p>Her body responded to him, her arms around his waist and her legs spread wide to take him inside her. She had always felt unsure about having sex with a man because she had never even seen a movie, but then again, it was what she had expected at any rate. He held his shaft as he plunged inside of her and she loved every second of it.</p> <p>Her hands were braced against the wall as she felt him begin his own arousal and push himself harder, harder in their thrusting and she felt her excitement build quickly. With her eyes half closed, she saw the full length of his shaft pushing into her hole as he thrust himself in and out of her. Her hands were up against the mirror as he pushed himself harder and harder.</p> <p>She knew he was close, so close. "God yeah, come on in me. I want to feel you inside me." He pulled out and grabbed her hips, drawing her body even closer to him.</p> <p>"Please me?" she whispered, looking out over her shoulder a little.</p> <p>"God yes, come on." he said, taking her hips. He plunged forward again into her and again she felt that incredible pressure deep inside, the way her body was reacting to him and the intensity she felt coming from him. The way he pushed himself all the way into her body. Feeling him deep within her. Feeling that pleasure spread through her. His eyes closed in concentration as he pumped himself into her, feeling her body respond to his movements, the way she felt.</p> <p>"Oh John, oh god, I'm going to cum again." she cried, her eyes half shut as her arousal washed over her. He stopped, his entire body tensed as his release hit him and he felt her body spasm under him as the heat washed through her and he felt her body tremble.</p> <p>They were both lost to it until his member, coated with their combined juices, slid slowly from between her thighs with their combined juices.</p> <p>"God yes, John." she whispered as she felt his member leave herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
