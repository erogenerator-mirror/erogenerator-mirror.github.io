"Don't move," she tells me.</p> <p>I open my eyes for a moment and I see a mirror image of me. My face looks normal as I look at my makeup, hair, clothes and hair.</p> <p>"Is something the matter?" she asks.</p> <p>"No, it's just..."</p> <p>She holds out the water to wash my hair. It feels strange. I don't know why, but it's so sensual. I'm actually feeling very excited as I wash my face again with her gentle, soaping hands.</p> <p>Her hands are so soft and gentle. Her hands are so warm and the touch is so loving.</p> <p>I start to feel very sexual. I imagine kissing her body with her hands above her head, touching, feeling and feeling every inch of her body.</p> <p>Her touch feels so warm and powerful as she caresses every part of our bodies. My wet hands run down her spine a little as I feel her body press into mine.</p> <p>Her hands move down to my crotch, which feels so hot. I'm already feeling aroused by her touch. As she starts to rub her fingers up and down my slit, I feel my heart rate quicken. I want to look into her eyes as she rubs my clit.</p> <p>I'm not sure how I do that, but my heart is pounding.</p> <p>"Let's go into the bathroom," she says to me as she turns to go upstairs. I'm excited by her words as they echo in my mind.</p> <p>We stand up and as I stand up to take my bathrobe off, I notice that her top half is slightly damp. The warmth of it makes me feel even more desirable as I walk toward the bathroom. I start to walk to the bathroom as she follows me.</p> <p>As I enter the bathroom I feel her hands start to wash my hair again. Her hands are so soft but the feel of her hands as they caress my body as she goes up and down my legs is making me so horny again.</p> <p>"Let's take off my bathrobe," she says as she finishes with my hair.</p> <p>She looks at me and then slowly takes off all of my robe. I've seen the look on her face as she was bathing and watching her, but this is almost... different.</p> <p>She's looking at me and as I take off my bathrobe, I notice she has a bit of a wetness between her legs.</p> <p>"I'm going to take my bath under the water of the shower," she says.</p> <p>"That sounds good."</p> <p>We both step into the water, it feeling very warm. I close my eyes and enjoy all that's happening. As I relax my body on the shower wall, I imagine her body being pressed up against mine in the shower.</p> <p>My thoughts are floating down into her eyes as I try to imagine her lips wrapped around my clit. Her body shivers and shivers as I keep thinking about her lips and mouth touching me there. I can't contain myself any longer, I just hold her close and caress her as she feels my hands massage her body.</p> <p>"Let's take off our bathrobes," she says as she gets a couple of pairs of pajamas out of the closet. We take off our bathrobes as well. I feel so turned on that I know I probably have my eyes half closed.</p> <p>She puts on a pair of panties as she puts a black bra on, I can't tell the color of it.</p> <p>"We've never done the same position that we did in the tub," she says.</p> <p>"I love the feeling of your breasts in my hands," I say.</p> <p>"I love your touch all over my body too," she sighs with my name under her breath.</p> <p>"Let's take these off."</p> <p>She doesn't want to take them off, but for me too.</p> <p>I take off my panty and my bra, throwing them away. I look at her as I put her panties on and she stares at me as I put on the panties.</p> <p>"Do you mind if we take off our panties too."</p> <p>"Why would I mind?"</p> <p>"If you don't mind it, you can take them off as well."</p> <p>I can't believe I'm actually trying to resist her asking me to take off my panties. I'm getting so excited again, and the whole situation has me extremely horny. As I'm taking off my panties, I can't help but admire how her body looks in her underpants.</p> <p>"I might change my mind if you wear the underwear too," she smiles.</p> <p>"Thank you for letting me changeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
