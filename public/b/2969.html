This was the first time that I had ever touched another man's penis, and I wondered what that would feel like. We were sitting by the pool with a sun-glove on the wall, he gently stroking my legs as I played with his cock. I smiled at him, "I figured you'd like a little sunbathing."</p> <p>"So, you are really going to do it?" I said, "I mean, I'm not some guy playing with another woman's ass, but you look great in front of me and you are so hard..."</p> <p>He smiled, "I don't think I am, but I will do it a long time. Are you ready..."</p> <p>"I am, but not as eager to get into bed with you."</p> <p>He kissed me, "Do you want it on your ass first?" As if he had a choice, any choice, "yes, but I want your tongue up my ass after it's over."</p> <p>I laughed. I wanted him to tongue my ass while I was riding her, right now, and the idea of this would have made me extremely horny, but to be honest, when I was horny, I wouldn't think about it. I still didn't want to be too obvious, either.</p> <p>"It's not an option, really. I haven't had a cock up my ass."</p> <p>"So you don't really like anal?"</p> <p>"Oh, I guess I can admit that I haven't, in fact, but I think I will anyway. I didn't plan it all the way."</p> <p>"Neither did I," he said, "but I am willing to try. Right now, I don't want to say I have never done it before. I think I might learn something from it tonight, though."</p> <p>"Haha, you really do," I laughed, getting up. I quickly dried off from my massage and got my bikini top and trunks in place, then got out of the pool. I went downstairs and dried off when David came up. I smiled.</p> <p>"Thank you," I said, "I hope you didn't want one of the other guys to think you weren't enjoying yourself."</p> <p>"Oh, it was fun, but I think we can get to it, too. Are you ready?"</p> <p>I was looking around the house for him and he had made a lot of noise. I headed for the bedroom, then stopped, "I'm not that much interested in guys right now, am I?"</p> <p>"Not at all, sweetie," he said. "Do you have any condoms? Or should I just turn the light off and go take a shower with you?"</p> <p>"Uh, the light turns back on when I am in the shower and I take the shower with you," I said as I headed into the bedroom.</p> <p>When I got there, David started to undress, "You are really going to have to get out of these bathing suits and into the guest bath," he said, "We'll dry off while you get ready. I'm on my way."</p> <p>"But this doesn't work," I said, "you don't understand. I am going to get ready while you do your business."</p> <p>"Yes, of course," he said, "just bring your top and bottoms and we can go."</p> <p>"That's so sweet," I said, "but we better get out of here."</p> <p>I heard him get out, and I knew he was going to join me in the shower with me.</p> <p>When I walked into the bathroom, he was drying his hair and his cock was hard again. I took it in my hand and held it, staring at him as he dried his hair, running my fingers over and around his lips. He was about to close his mouth on his lips, but I stopped him.</p> <p>"It's okay," I told him. "Just hold onto this longer."</p> <p>I opened his lips and he looked at me, hesitating.</p> <p>"Just hold on a little longer," I said as I pulled him onto the shower floor.</p> <p>"Is that all?" he said, as he kissed me on the cheek.</p> <p>"Yes, I'm wet down there."</p> <p>"Me too, my skin is tingly. But maybe later."</p> <p>"Honey, there are some tissues in there. I like watching you move in the tub," he said, and he pulled me close and had his lips around my breast and were sucking my nipple, while his hand was stroking my pussy.</p> <p>After the first kiss, I leaned over and took him in my mouth and pulled him in theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
