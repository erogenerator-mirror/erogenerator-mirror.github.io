It is just a fuck."</p> <p>The smile on his face was even better. The woman she'd been with before was already being fucked, and by an experienced man and an amazing woman.</p> <p>"Good to hear. I'll let you know how to get to the top of this list."</p> <p>*************************</p> <p>She had an old-fashioned wardrobe. Her clothes were mostly long-sleeved, but tailored to highlight her curves. She wore a short, one-piece outfit that showed off her long, sexy legs, her full, beautiful tits, and the tight black spandex bathing suit she'd taken to wearing before she moved out.</p> <p>Bart noticed her black string-dancer shoes. They matched and looked fantastic on her. They looked more like shoes than a dress. As if the outfit could be considered a swimsuit.</p> <p>"Why don't you let him fuck you?" He asked, his smile gone.</p> <p>"I'm not going to be the one paying for sex," she complained.</p> <p>"What's so bad about having sex that you don't mind a strange man making love to you?"</p> <p>"It's not sex," she corrected herself, "it's just some crazy, kinky shit."</p> <p>He shook his head. "You're all crazy. There's no way. You won't get in the mood."</p> <p>"Fuck you?" She spat. Then she added, "You have to give the woman a good fucking before she fucks you. After, you're just a fuck toy."</p> <p>Her voice was full of anger and sarcasm. What could she say? She would just kill him and leave him alone. He would never get her to fuck him. He'd take her back. End of my day. It's a sad story, but if she'll have me, I'm all yours.</p> <p>"Can he? It's okay, I know it is."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"And you have my consent."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>Her anger was gone. Gone and she was back at it like he had taken her. He was on his knees on the bed, between her legs. Her eyes were closed, her head leaned back to the side. Her breasts were straining against the suit and strained against their confines.</p> <p>He pulled her legs around him, forcing her legs open. Her cunt looked tight, hot. He took his mouth and attacked it, pushing his tongue against her sex, his chin against her clit. She tasted like strawberries. She moaned and his eyes went wide. He shoved his entire head inside of her, thrusting his tongue into her, rubbing her clit with his teeth while sucking hard on the hard little nub. And then he had to pull away, sucking hungrily on her clit. She gasped and moaned. And then, with her hands on his head, she came, her thighs spasming on his head and her hips thrusting up against him.</p> <p>He pulled away, his dark head wet with her cum. He leaned forward, bringing his face to hers and kissing her lips. They kissed for a while, his tongue pressing against her lips, then she broke the kiss.</p> <p>"Oh, shit," she said, panting. "My lips... They're dry."</p> <p>His body went limp as he felt her shudder with desire. He looked down at his face, her lips, her cheeks, her breasts, her thighs, her face. He knew that when she came in his mouth, he was going to cum on himself. He was almost done.</p> <p>"Bart?" she looked at him. "Why did you put it that way?"</p> <p>"Because I want our relationship to continue." He kissed her again.</p> <p>She smiled, a little uncertainly. "I agree."</p> <p>"Don't I feel just the same?"</p> <p>"Of course you do. It's complicated."</p> <p>"Of course not." He kissed her again, "but we've been together for a long time, and that's okay. It will get better. I'll leave you alone."</p> <p>She kissed his face, his chin, his throat. She was still feeling a lot better. She didn't know where to start, where to start. He was the only one who made her feel this way.</p> <p>"Will you let me fuck you?" She asked, surprised.</p> <p>"It's your choice."</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Bart had just gotten off the phone with his agentâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
