He looked down at his hands as if they were trying to hold him, so he reached out with his free hand and wiped some of the cum off his fingers. His left hand had started to slide his finger along his lips, but his eyes were beginning to get blurry, and he could barely focus.</p> <p>'You're doing fine, honey, really, I really can't say that much about how it feels. The last thing I want to do is give you a sore hand.'</p> <p>His lips went back to her neck, and he started to kiss every centimetre of skin he crossed as his fingers stroked her soft skin, then, just before she reached down, to pull him closer, her thighs opened a little, to help him slide himself inside. The skin of her pussy was completely hairless, and it was only his fingers that were touching it.</p> <p>He could feel her hand gripping the back of his neck, and he began to move himself inside. He started slowly, almost to a halt, then increased as she moaned, and pulled herself to him. He had felt the skin of her thighs pressing against his arms, that incredible warmth of her pussy on his fingers, and he was getting harder inside her, but he wanted more. So there was no hesitation, even as her hand moved against him.</p> <p>He moved a little more, then stopped, and pulled her down and out of his lap so he could face her again. Still inside her, he looked down at her face, and she was crying, and he wanted to tell her it wasn't his fault, but he knew she would stop, and it was already too late. He kissed her cheek like a child, and pulled her back to him. She could barely breathe, and her eyes were wide with fear. He could see how her eyes had tried to hold him back, when she realized what was wrong, but had been able to hide him just as he had seen her before.</p> <p>He was sure she'd stopped breathing, her fear was gone, and she was breathing hard, so she couldn't stop smiling. The tension had vanished inside him, and now he kissed her again, and held her still, his hands sliding along her legs.</p> <p>She made a noise, and pushed him away with her legs, saying she was sorry. He was still inside her, despite her tears, so he was just holding himself inside her.</p> <p>'Don't move, please?' He said into her hair, 'No more, no less. Please don't stop, I love you, I hate you.'</p> <p>They were still kissing when she pushed him away again, and his arms pulled her up and he held her for a breath. She was sobbing now, and he was being held by her. He was afraid he was hurting her, and she didn't seem to care.</p> <p>'Kneel down please, please, let me take care of you,' he said.</p> <p>She took a deep breath, and looked up at him. 'No,' she repeated so quietly. 'Kneel down, please.'</p> <p>She was shaking now, almost afraid he'd hurt her. He was so close to her, and he could see it in her eyes, her lips trembling. He leaned in and kissed her again, a little shorter this time, and then pulled out of her and stood up, then turned her over. He wrapped her legs, and grabbed her under her knees in his arms, and lifted her so her ass was sticking up in the air. He could see her pussy opening again, and he looked down at her. She looked so beautiful, but her eyes had gotten blurry.</p> <p>'God that was good,' he whispered.</p> <p>The tears had stopped, and he was still in her, her legs apart. He looked at the sight of his cock so hard and long, and he wanted this moment to last forever.</p> <p>'Do you want me to finish inside you? Would you like that? You want me to slide down inside you, don't you? You want me to take you?'</p> <p>She looked up at him, tears coming to her eyes; she shook her head, and he moved over her and sat down, feeling her body heat up in his arms.</p> <p>'God yes, do anything for me,' he said. 'Just let me love you, please.'</p> <p>He wanted to reach out and touch her, but knew she had no choice, and he wasn't looking at anything other than her body, even though he couldn't see anything but how she felt under him, and the way her body seemed to press into him, the way his cock was so hard and long and it was her body that was pressing on top of it, making it harder and throbbingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
