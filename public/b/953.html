I asked, sitting down at the table.</p> <p>"Oh, nothing. You can sleep now," she said, standing up again. "In your room, silly," and she walked to the kitchen, picking up a carton of milk, "but you can stay here on the couch, or in my flat upstairs, and you can sleep in there."</p> <p>"You know, I might have to spend the weekend here. I didn't want to leave the house without a shower or a decent bed to snuggle up to if I ever tried to go into the house with you," I said.</p> <p>"No!" she said, walking up to me and holding out her hand, "you can stay in my flat." As she took my hand and led me upstairs I couldn't help but feel a bit of the same thing. I couldn't see the face of any of the members of my school anymore. I know the look on the faces of my school and teachers would be all over me or have me put on a stage in the middle of the day. I'm certainly not the smartest or most well-rounded kid in our school but I've been in the best position of the school for now. I didn't know how many others would ever be in my class. I just knew I wanted to find out. I wanted to find out why a boy liked to talk about himself in front of other men and I wanted to know more.</p> <p>I followed her up the stairs, not having much energy to care for the conversation as she led me up to her living room. I followed her out into the corridor of her flat and she closed the door and locked it. I looked around and heard the unmistakable sound of her heels clicking on the cobbles before I heard a slight click as she stood up. She opened the door and as she did her feet slid onto my shoes, making a small bump against my feet. I stood up immediately and looked at her in alarm. She looked down as she put her hands behind her back and began undressing. "You okay?" I asked, my breath catching in the back of my throat.</p> <p>"Yeah, thanks," she looked up at me and smiled slightly nervously.</p> <p>"You think I am weird?" I asked her.</p> <p>"No, no. I don't know whether or not that's appropriate but I don't want you to think anything weird with me," she replied. "Do you think you could get me a pillow or something? I know you'd like to stay in there for as long as you can. I've had some problems with my mother and she got upset when I was a baby. You remember our first night? We got home and we went to bed and made love and she started crying and I started crying and told her I loved her and I wanted to be with her. But I think I need to make sure that you're okay. Now that your old folks are old enough for you." She began to unbutton her blouse and I could see the swell of her breasts in the dim light. Her blouse came off and I could see her belly, with a patch of light down it, and the swell of her thighs, that ended just above where her skirt started. She took off her coat and handed it to me. As she stepped into the light, her back arched slightly, causing the curve of her breasts and the swell of her tummy to appear even more. She turned around to face me and I could feel the warmness of her breath on my face. I stood there dumbstruck.</p> <p>"Can I come in?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes, you know I can come in," I replied, trying to keep the excitement from entering my voice.</p> <p>I followed her into the room and saw that she had a king-sized bed in one corner and a small chair on the opposite wall.</p> <p>"I think I may be a bit uncomfortable," she admitted. "My old folks would like you to stay here. Do you mind if I undress?"</p> <p>"No, not at all," I said, not wanting to interrupt her.</p> <p>"Would you like me to undress you?" she asked, looking around the room, "I have the spare room upstairs and I think you may not want me to do it anyway. It's so uncomfortable in here."</p> <p>"No, go ahead, it's okay. You just don't want me to get in trouble while this is going on and I think I'll just sleep in your bed tonight."</p> <p>"No, I like the way you think," she said.</p> <p>"Do you understand?" I asked.</p> <p>"No, not really. Here," she said, pulling her blouse off revealing her pale skin, and her small breasts and the flatness of her stomach, the line of her waist down to her navel.
