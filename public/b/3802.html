She could feel the heat of his gaze on her body. She could feel the heat of his hand on her leg, his fingers running up her thigh as she got closer. Was that how they were looking at each other that made them look this way?</p> <p>She closed her eyes, and allowed her hands to roam over her body. It was all so sensual. It made her feel like she wanted it more than she wanted it to feel all the way down to her toes. She felt dirty and perverted and sexy. She wanted him to run his hands over her body. Feel her body under his hands. He wanted her bad! But now she was going to make the ultimate act for them both, for herself, and for him. But first he would have to have her.</p> <p>She felt his lips kiss her lips gently. It took her breath away. The feel of him kissing her had sent chills through her body. He was so beautiful.</p> <p>He could feel her body trembling against him. Her legs trembled as the heat between her thighs intensified. He could have her. He wanted her. He wanted her and he was determined not to let her go. He wanted her to be the one he was willing to make love to. And he was taking great care to make that happen. He loved her. She wanted him, she craved him. He was hers.</p> <p>He continued to kiss her lips and her neck and finally she was able to take her breath for once. He could smell her scent. The wetness he had smeared across her body was intoxicating.</p> <p>He placed his hands on her shoulders. She felt more vulnerable by his power over her now. He used her body for his pleasure. He wanted to possess her but she needed more. And when she felt him kiss her nipple, her arousal skyrocketed. She closed the gap between them now, and she pressed his face against her breast, kissing and sucking on it. He moved his mouth further down, his hands roaming down her back towards her ass. He was getting hungry for her now.</p> <p>"Yes," she whispered.</p> <p>He ran his hand up and down her legs.</p> <p>"Ohhh God." She breathed. He pulled her ass closer to him and continued kissing her neck, sliding his tongue between her breasts and finally he bit her nipple. A guttural moan escaped her lips at the sensation.</p> <p>"Are you scared?" He asked as he continued biting her nipple. His hand on her butt moved to her pussy. He began rubbing her lips through her pants. His hand moved down between her legs.</p> <p>She felt her body heat as he pushed a finger inside her. She could feel herself dripping from wanting him. She could feel the moisture between her legs. She wanted him. He felt her hand on his cock through his pants. It was throbbing inside. It felt so good.</p> <p>"Mmm. I'm so sorry, honey." She lied. She turned to face him.</p> <p>"Not sorry, but I'm scared." She said with a slight voice. His grip was on her even harder now.</p> <p>"I know. I like it rough. But tonight, we are going to let our bodies play games. It's going to feel so good."</p> <p>"I know, I'm so sorry. I don't want you to do bad things, honey."</p> <p>"I know. But just try not to get too excited."</p> <p>She wanted to say something but wasn't sure if it would make much good. She felt his lips on her neck. His body weight on top of hers. She could feel his member pushing against her. Her hand was on his ass now. She felt him move down her body kissing her breasts and stomach. His lips traveled further on her body. He licked her stomach then moved down to her panties. He licked her stomach once more, then down to her pussy. She could feel the dampness against his lips from the wetness. She could smell her own sex and feel his lips around it. It made her head spin. He licked her thighs from her ankles to her toes.</p> <p>"Mmmm. I can't wait for you to suck on me."</p> <p>"I'm not sure I can, baby."</p> <p>"I want you to suck me. Do it for me. Do it to me."</p> <p>"I'll be right back." He stood up and looked at her. "But wait."</p> <p>It couldn't have been that long. She didn't have long to wait, but she knew if she let him have her right then, she wouldn't have to listen to him. He was kissing her breasts now and her nipples was starting to get hard.</p> <p>"It's okay, baby. It's just us. He's your friend."</p> <p>"Yesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
