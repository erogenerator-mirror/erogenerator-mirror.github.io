She said.</p> <p>She grabbed my hand and pulled me along, not wanting to let go of my hand and head after so long. We arrived just inside the door and she let go of my hand and went back to her car. I was feeling really good when she opened her door and got out, but I got a sense that things were beginning to get weird, especially now.</p> <p>"So, do you have a girlfriend?" I heard Lexie ask.</p> <p>"No, actually, no. I'm not." I said.</p> <p>"That's great. Why don't you sit on this sofa?" She said, reaching over to the sofa. "And don't get lost. Remember my offer before we went?" She said, holding up a small bottle.</p> <p>"Don't go anywhere," I said, walking to her. "How about you?"</p> <p>"I will if I have to drive." She said.</p> <p>"Do we have a deal?" I asked.</p> <p>"Done!" she replied, sitting on the sofa.</p> <p>We talked for about 15 minutes, mostly about work and everything. Finally, I started to get a bit bored.</p> <p>"Well, I guess I've been a fool." I said. "I was really hoping to work on my degree there, but unfortunately my grades are slipping."</p> <p>"You're no longer going to college. You've actually been hired by this corporation?"</p> <p>"No, sorry." I said. I was starting to worry.</p> <p>"You're so funny Lexie. What makes you so funny?" I asked.</p> <p>"I've been working on a company, but I just haven't had time. Besides, I'm already working on my own degree. I've got a lot of time on my hands working, but it would be nice to have some more time." She said.</p> <p>I sighed and looked at my watch. It was almost 6:00. "Well, you're probably on your way home before too long. Do you want to grab a quick shower and get the dust out and fix up a nice outfit?" I asked.</p> <p>"That would be cool." Lexie said. "But I don't want you just going around on me. We'll go to your bedroom and get started. No kissing or anything and just watch TV." she said. "What ever you choose to do, just don't be too much fun to get into." she added, looking at the ceiling before laughing.</p> <p>"It would be nice to get out and walk around, just watch a movie. But I'm really tired." I said, pulling my pants up.</p> <p>"Ok, I can see that you've got a lot to think about. But we'll talk about it another time. For now, you have another hour to get ready for work." she said, sitting up. "I don't usually do this after I've gotten really wound up, but today I just need to get out and get ready."</p> <p>"Well, you're sure going to get home too soon," I said, watching the clock. It was getting close to midnight.</p> <p>"Yeah," she laughed, "and I still have to get ready, but I can just as soon as I'm done. But I have to do something anyways." I said, watching her as she finished her wine.</p> <p>"Ok, I'm getting out. I hope you're not too stressed." she said, turning to leave.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, Lexie. I really wanted this day to be great for us." I said.</p> <p>"Not as bad as you thought." she replied, opening the door.</p> <p>We walked out together and sat on the sofa, talking about work.</p> <p>"I need to finish what my sister did today when she found out what this corporation was all about." I mentioned. "Besides, I want it to be the most fun weekend of my life so far."</p> <p>"Well, that would be awesome Lexie." she said. "But I really still think you'd be more comfortable in your room."</p> <p>"If I had to, I'd have changed my mind before I got too drunk." I said.</p> <p>"I can tell." she laughed. "But I really think we have a deal. Go get dressed and we'll grab dinner."</p> <p>I pulled my t-shirt out of my pants and slipped on a shirt, deciding to just go without underwear or stockings. Lexie came back out wearing one of her little red dresses.</p> <p>"Why don't you take your dress off and go change." I said.</p> <p>"This is kinda a deal breaker." she replied. "You can leave. You're never going to have the chance to get ready, you'll never get home and not see your sister againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
