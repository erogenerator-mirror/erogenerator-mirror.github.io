She asked, trying desperately to imagine he was that big even though it didn't hurt, but his eyes kept returning to hers. "So you really want to do this?" She asked him, unable to believe she wasn't scared of this.</p> <p>"No, I just don't want it to be a one time thing." He told her honestly, even though the desire was already there. "Not now. Not when I'll want you to think of me when you are feeling the urge." He added with a smile before looking away.</p> <p>She laughed softly. "I guess you just want me to do this all the time. I can't think of anything else." He told her sincerely, the heat of his gaze on hers was making her heart sink. "If it were just just just a once in a lifetime thing, I'm sure we would be perfectly fine and happy. I think it's time you had some fun." He grinned wickedly at her. "Maybe I just need to get you to admit that you're turned on." He teased, taking a quick sip of coffee before sitting back on his chair.</p> <p>"Maybe you're wrong." She grinned. "Maybe I can still think of you on occasion when I'm alone." She said with another laugh as she looked over at the coffee sitting on the bench between them. "But honestly, I was a little surprised when you told me that you were going to be coming over tonight."</p> <p>He sat his thoughts back to her, smiling and thinking. "I wouldn't want to ruin a good day for everyone." He laughed as he sat his coffee down. "But it's a good thing I thought about it as I made my way through the store. Besides, you know I have to take a break to get the store going first thing in the morning. I had forgotten that was part of it." He admitted to himself before smiling.</p> <p>"Well, you can't be so bad." She said with a laugh. She stood as she reached over to the cupboard to open it. She looked over at him before leaning casually against the counter. She was so relaxed with him that she actually felt a twinge of anticipation as she approached him once more. "So, what day are we going to have a threesome?" She asked as she finished opening the cupboard and sat down in her seat. She turned away from him suddenly as she caught sight of the clock. Ten. "I'm sorry, I know we'll have to do this sooner rather than later." She told him, reaching out to hold his hand. "But I think we should be done with this now." She said, pulling her hand back from his. "It's not a really necessary problem." He told her. "I just think we are going to need to enjoy our time together together a few times more than what we have right now." He added, sliding his arm around her shoulders. "If we continue to talk about it, I want you to be sure you aren't disappointed in me."</p> <p>"I'm not." Her replied before leaning in to kiss him on the lips. "It's okay. I told you that you should be comfortable enough to start with a threesome first."</p> <p>They sat in silence for a moment as they sat there watching the clock as they listened to one another. As he watched the minutes tick by, he thought about how good she felt in his arms, how wet she was, how it was really starting to feel to have a third cock in her pussy and how they were definitely going to enjoy each other's company that day of all days. He had no idea what might have prompted his decision to do this. He certainly wasn't going to tell her that he was thinking of getting a three way and she would probably not make any objections since they had been together so long. He could hardly say that his decision was any different than what he had decided to do to them. He could imagine how she felt, what it would do to them, what it would do to them. And as he watched the clock, the two of them seemed to be getting closer and closer. His hand began to move slowly as he continued to watch the clock. Even though he had told her not to touch herself, he didn't realize just how turned on in that little scenario was. Maybe it had something to do with his hand feeling the fullness of her nipples underneath her shirt.</p> <p>He was surprised when they were right above his own, standing out hard and proud from his chest. He thought that the sight in front of him was pretty hot as well. He glanced over at her reflection in the mirror and stared at her for a moment before closing his eyes and returning his attention to the clock. It was a bit more than an hour past nine, but he was still pretty sure that they would get done beforeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
