Then, after a moment of his breath on her cheek. "And if I wanted to, I could make it happen."</p> <p>As he said this, he began to roll her onto her belly.</p> <p>"I can't do anything."</p> <p>"You can't," Estephan said, smiling.</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>He knelt on one knee. "I can't be in you."</p> <p>Hands behind his back, he lifted her in his arms.</p> <p>"I love you," she said as he carried her out to bed.</p> <p>She laid her head on his shoulder.</p> <p>"I love you," she said again.</p> <p>Her hand was upon his cock as she lay on her back, slowly stroking and milking it with her hand.</p> <p>This was not the time for tenderness, she told herself, not yet for love. If he went too far, no woman would ever love him as she did. He would never make her want to take him into her mouth. He would never make her want him. She was thinking about her last boyfriend, the big, handsome young man, this other man on her life, and what they'd been doing with each other, or to her lover...</p> <p>He was only twenty two years old.</p> <p>She loved him. She did not want him. She knew this, and he knew this, as if they'd never done anything else, had never had sex more than once, or that it had even been a long distance relationship.</p> <p>He didn't ask her, nor did he ever demand what she did, she knew. If she was not aching for the intimacy of a sexual relationship with a man, he was more than likely just making herself cum.</p> <p>She did not know the feelings he'd had to give, but she loved every minute and every minute of it, and the time they had been apart was just the icing on the cake. But he was a man. She was not his equal, not to the point that she was not her equal, but an equal partner.</p> <p>But was she his equal?</p> <p>"Come back here, now", she said.</p> <p>No response. Then her eyes widened.</p> <p>Then, the feeling of a hand upon her breast was replaced by an urgent squeeze of his hand, as if his fingers were rubbing her nipple.</p> <p>Estephan felt her body respond to him.</p> <p>He felt her body react.</p> <p>His hand left her breast, leaving her body with only one thought.</p> <p>It was to make love to her.</p> <p>A voice, and his own voice, broke his momentary paralysis.</p> <p>"What?" he heard.</p> <p>"I think-"</p> <p>"Don't you think?"</p> <p>"But you're a woman," she smiled. "And, you want me."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Yes, what?"</p> <p>"Yes," he said.</p> <p>She was right. His body told him now.</p> <p>So, he did now, because he meant it. He wanted it to go on and on.</p> <p>He slipped his mouth upon hers, kissed her.</p> <p>She opened her mouth to him.</p> <p>She kissed him back.</p> <p>Their tongues intertwined, and the smell of it brought his cock to life.</p> <p>He slid his other hand upon her back, and down to her buttock.</p> <p>She broke away, and he kissed her neck to her chest and to her breast.</p> <p>Then he began to kiss her breasts. She loved that. She loved it a lot.</p> <p>She loved it more.</p> <p>His lips parted her nipples.</p> <p>"Take me, please," she said breathlessly.</p> <p>She felt him pressing himself closer to her.</p> <p>"Touch me," she said.</p> <p>"I'm not sure that I can, and I don't want to-" he began to say.</p> <p>"I want you," Estephan told her. "Take me, please."</p> <p>His lips moved to her belly button.</p> <p>Hands caressed her belly, with their hands.</p> <p>"Yes," she whispered. "Touch me."</p> <p>She felt his hard cock at her hand.</p> <p>His lips sought hers again.</p> <p>"Touch me here," she urged him, feeling him move down towards her thighs. She knew how much he loved to kiss her there, and had wondered about doing so before, but had not yet, and now, she knew she was going to find out. She was going to let him, to love her, and to be with her, with him, if only for a moment.</p> <p>"Touch me," Estephan ordered. "Touch me right here."</p> <p>He moved, sliding across her belly.</p> <p>His mouth moved to just aboveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
