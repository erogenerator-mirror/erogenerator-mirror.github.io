The tip of my finger slipped between her open lips and she sighed, arching her hips. My index finger found her clitoris. I could feel it start at the tip, slowly rise to meet the rhythm of her hips as they fucked my hand. As her hips lifted and thrust against my hand, I was able to slip my middle finger deep inside her while I began to slowly fuck my finger into her with the other hand.</p> <p>She reached down and started to press her hips to my hand. She groaned and writhed. I knew it would be impossible for her to stay still but she continued to work her hips against me.</p> <p>I could tell she was getting close. Her breathing began to increase and I knew she was about to come, and I continued to work my finger in and out of her, until her legs suddenly clamped down on my hand and her hips jerked. She was thrusting with me and I knew that she had come. Her mouth opened and her lips parted, and her lips and tongue met mine, and I felt the soft wetness of her tongue on mine. Her arms fell to her sides and she slumped against the wall in her orgasm.</p> <p>I reached a hand under my arm and lifted her off of me. She fell against me, still sprawled out on the bed. Her legs were splayed, her face close to mine. One hand wrapped around my neck, the other moved down her body and found her nipple with the fingers of the other. I took it into my mouth and sucked gently on it. She opened her eyes and looked down at me, her hands sliding across my skin. "Oh my," she sighed, "that feels so good. That was wonderful."</p> <p>She leaned up against me, pressing her hips against mine again. She kissed my eyelids and my nose and my lips. "No more sex for me?" she asked. "I want to do the same thing but if you don't mind I'll do you now."</p> <p>I grinned at her as I slid my hand under the sheet and lifted it from her body. She was lying on top of the sheet, her skin still tingling with afterglow, her nipples hard and proud. She lay with her face toward me and I leaned over to kiss her. She raised her head and our lips met again, just a little softness.</p> <p>"Oh, I never felt like that before," she said. "It was just so ... so good! Thank you. You know I was embarrassed at first when I let you touch me but my body wasn't used to being touched. When you kissed me, it felt right but I didn't feel embarrassed or excited or ... I guess I thought that if it was you that I was excited about, then perhaps I felt excited or excited about you, too. I thought I would never get used to the sensation of you touching me, though." She giggled. "You did the same thing to me, too! I'll always remember that. And ... I'm happy that you like my body. I don't think it would take much to turn you on. I'm always looking for new experiences."</p> <p>She reached down and cupped my cheek with her hand. "You make me very happy," she said. She drew my face to hers and kissed me hard. She raised her hips as I brought my hand back down to my own pussy. I parted it and I found my clitoris with my finger. A gasp escaped her lips.</p> <p>"That was nice," she murmured. "I wish I could do it again."</p> <p>Kissing her, I took her hand from my pussy and lay back on top of the sheet. She looked down, studying the shape of me. "You're really beautiful," I said.</p> <p>"Thanks. That's nothing compared to your breasts and body." She lifted her hands and ran them through my hair. "I didn't realize that I was such a big fan."</p> <p>"You are a little too," I said as I took her hand, lifted it to my mouth and licked her juices off one finger. "I liked you touching my breasts and fingering my pussy and ... and now I do."</p> <p>"Oh, don't you get enough?" she asked. "I don't do that so often." My hands traveled down to her navel.</p> <p>I ran my tongue lightly across her navel and found her belly button. "Oh yes," she said as I pulled my finger out from between her legs. "I'm so ticklish everywhere!" she laughed, rubbing my thigh.</p> <p>Her hand slid up to my breast, holding it with the thumb and forefinger of her other hand. She took the nipple into her mouth and began to suck and lick it. â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
