She said.</p> <p>He got a confused look on his face.</p> <p>"Mike. Don't talk to me like that." She tried again. "I want you listen to me while you're with me."</p> <p>"Yes, Ma'am, yes, I mean it."</p> <p>"You can be very bossy, you know." She was now walking like this, and he was standing a foot or two in front of her.</p> <p>"Mike, you're blushing, I can see it, I can't help it."</p> <p>"Well, Ma'am, I'm sorry. Sorry for not letting you come down a little."</p> <p>"No it's okay Mike, please go with me. We're going to get a pizza." She reached out and took his hand and led him to her house.</p> <p>"Ma'am, I never should have let you take me out on the boat. It was wonderful."</p> <p>She was smiling as she led him up to the patio and she took his hand and held it as she pulled him toward the patio stairs to the pool. Mike was a bit stunned, it's all so new to him.</p> <p>She gave him a quick kiss and stepped back pulling his hands up under her wrap skirt.</p> <p>"You're so silly. I haven't even done this, it's so new to me. Come." She pulled him up with her and they went inside her little house.</p> <p>There was a bar set at the front with pizza boxes and a bar set also on the back porch. They sat down on a chaise and began eating when Mike saw a DVD and a big glass filled bowl.</p> <p>"Mike, do you want another beer?" She asked?</p> <p>He got a big grin on his face, it was all so cool.</p> <p>"I think I'd like one, thank you."</p> <p>"Mike are you sure you don't want another beer?"</p> <p>"No Ma'am, I'm all for one."</p> <p>She smiled at him then moved to him. She put her arms around him and said, "Honey, I like being with you. I like it a lot."</p> <p>"Oh yes, Ma'am." He said in an excited voice.</p> <p>"Okay, now stop there, go back to watching that video." She pulled him close again. "Look at how they have the whole family going together!"</p> <p>She put her arms around Mike and kissed him on the lips.</p> <p>"There's another one of those now." She said.</p> <p>He took the glass away and looked over at the screen. The woman was a real woman, and she had her eyes closed and she was looking as the other woman was, in fact, a female.</p> <p>"Oh my I love watching this!" He said with his mind racing.</p> <p>"I think I have a movie here that's good." She said with a big smile on her face.</p> <p>"Is that it?"</p> <p>"Yes, this is the real thing." She put her head on one arm and ran her fingers through Mike's hair.</p> <p>"Okay. Then it's time to pay the bill. Then it's your turn." She said with a laugh."</p> <p>"I can't believe you're doing this."</p> <p>"I guess since I'm making you pay the bill." She leaned her head on his shoulder and caressed his face.</p> <p>"That's right. You've got to pay it."</p> <p>"Excuse me but the bill is going to be an important one, and I don't want to have you thinking you're giving out or something!"</p> <p>"Mike, it's your wife's birthday party."</p> <p>Mike didn't know what to make of that, was it only about a week ago that Mike and the wife got together and told Mike the whole story. Well actually, they had gotten together for one another's birthday. The wife had come to the party, and Mike thought that he had just broken up with their son.</p> <p>"Maybe that's not very fair. I mean if you don't do it, this is your night and all." She reached out and began stroking his cheek.</p> <p>He was sitting there with a look of terror and he turned back to watch.</p> <p>"Mike, if that isn't a horrible thing you must be really uncomfortable. What if someone would do what you're doing and put his hand over his prick if he got carried away and..."</p> <p>Mike's head snapped around trying to see it.</p> <p>"Do you remember the time you made a guy come over and you let him go and he let the wife have his turn in bed.
