His eyes flashed at the girl in his arms, and he said, "You don't mind watching us fuck do you?"</p> <p>"I have a better idea and don't mind. Let's go outside because it's getting dark out." She grinned as she grabbed his hand, then they were off the settee and headed around the front room.</p> <p>His arms enveloped her shoulders and pulled her close. He bent down and kissed her right cheek. "Let's get your coat changed."</p> <p>"Thanks."</p> <p>He grabbed her coat and she took it to the car and they left his bedroom. As they drove down the darkened streets to his apartment, they kept looking at each other. She could see a lot of excitement in his grey eyes, and she could see a little lust as well. She leaned her body against his, pressing her breasts against him. He lifted her face to his and kissed her lightly on the lips, then pulled back and looked into her eyes. "That was amazing."</p> <p>"Thank you..." Her hand reached out and ran through his dark hair. "I have to tell you, I have a whole different boyfriend from that one guy I was with a long time ago." She felt him pull away from her and his face darkened before he shook his head. "I'm sorry... I didn't mean to do that."</p> <p>"Don't worry about it." He leaned over and kissed her lightly on the lips, then moved his lips in a slow trail down her chin. He sucked on her bottom lip, then slid his tongue into her mouth. She returned his kiss, then closed her eyes as he pulled away, taking in the feeling of his lips over hers, her own tongue sliding against his. She could feel a slight stirring of excitement as their kisses became more intense. His right hand went around the back of her neck and pulled her harder against him, and she moaned into his mouth.</p> <p>His tongue slid into the back of her mouth, seeking hers. Their breaths mingled, and she took his hand, bringing it up to caress her breast.</p> <p>"Would you like to touch me?" He whispered. "I want to," her lips pressed against his again. "I can hardly move," she murmured.</p> <p>He slid his hands up to her rib cage and cupped her breast in his hand. He felt her nipple harden, and he squeezed it lightly.</p> <p>"Oh, that feels nice..." She opened her eyes and saw his lips move to her neck, and she could see a light blush in his cheeks. "Let's go to the bedroom," she said, taking his hand and pulling him into the bedroom.</p> <p>"No, let's get undressed and fuck right now," he whispered.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>She laid him on the bed, then quickly unfastened his zip and pulled down his pants. She pulled off the rest of his clothing, then leaned over and licked the tip of her husband's cock. It was slightly damp. She kissed him for a moment, then she slid her mouth down, taking it all into her mouth as he shuddered.</p> <p>"Oh, honey..." She moved her mouth back up and held his cock in her mouth as she felt the blood begin to surge through it. "Don't move."</p> <p>He laughed. She smiled and moved away, then moved onto either side of him. He leaned over and ran his hand up her thigh. "Feel all that sweat on me?" Her head nodded, and he said, "I'm the only one who doesn't have a dick." He slid his hand up her thigh to cup her pubic mound.</p> <p>"Mmmm...I suppose I do." Her hips began to grind against his hand. "Touch me there, just a little." With that, she put a finger inside herself, then pulled it out again. She brought it to meet the head of his dick and pushed her finger inside of her. He smiled as the wetness coated his fingers, and he ran his fingers lightly over her cheek. She put a hand on his arm and lowered her head down so he could kiss her. He slid his hand down and inside her panties, feeling the heat of her cunt and the pulsating, fleshy folds of her skin. He felt another finger enter her and then a third. She was wet and warm around his hand, and his hips were moving with hers as he stroked her slowly.</p> <p>She lowered her head again, then she lowered herself to his cock. He moved his hand down her body, taking her breasts in his hand as he caressed her with his fingers, circling her nipples and then sliding down to tease her cleft on the tip of his fingers.
