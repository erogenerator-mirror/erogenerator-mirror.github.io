She gasped suddenly and bit her lip, pulling her mouth away from mine so I could speak for the first time.</p> <p>"I . . . uhhh . . . I want us to come together."</p> <p>"Why?" Her eyes were shining with an emotion that I didn't understand but my heart had raced as an excited tingling was between the two of us.</p> <p>"It . . . it feels . . . wrong." The words came out softly between breathless breaths.</p> <p>"I don't want to hurt you."</p> <p>I nodded my head. "Don't be afraid." And I grabbed her hips and started to pull her towards me.</p> <p>"No, it's not right." I kissed her neck, biting it gently. "We need each other."</p> <p>"But we haven't made love. This is wrong."</p> <p>She turned her face towards me and kissed me softly but urgently.</p> <p>"Yes, we have made love, but my first time was just for you. There will be no more lovemaking."</p> <p>I pushed her gently and she let me go again as her arms wrapped around me and pulled me down onto her. "I won't go without loving you and . . . always." Her kisses were hot everywhere and I could feel her hard tits pressed against my ribcage.</p> <p>"We can't." I pulled free her chin, kissed her cheek and then, looking into her eyes, I said. "There's no room for anything else." I released hers so I could pull out from under her and let her down from the couch to kneel in front of me.</p> <p>"Now, get naked."</p> <p>She stood up, stripped her bra and panties off her legs and she lay back on the bed, spreading her legs. "Kiss me. Don't worry I like it. I'm just going to enjoy it if you do a good job." She placed her hand on the middle of her stomach and leaned up towards me. She put her left hand around my head, holding me against her while I put the head of my cock in her mouth. She started to suck it, swirling it and trying to fit more in with each pass she made.</p> <p>I watched my thick shaft slide in and out of her mouth and she used her tongue like a hand, running her lips up and down it a few times before letting it pull from her mouth to run back over my head.</p> <p>"Do you like my cock?" I asked her as I pulled the skin back over the tip.</p> <p>"Oh yes, lover. I love how you do it."</p> <p>I smiled at her. "You're not going to tell anyone we've made love." She raised herself up once more so I could kiss the tip of my cock, once more just below the flared ridge that covered my shaft, and said, "You will keep your promise, okay?" She kissed the tip and then pushed the shaft back down again. "I really love your cock," she said, and then she took me into her mouth again.</p> <p>I pushed myself in further, watching her lips working up and down my shaft as I pulled back and pushed it in again a little harder this time, but at the same time I was holding her head and rocking her, trying to take her further into my mouth and down my throat so I could take it. Her eyes were closed and she was panting like she was being hit by a fire truck. I continued to push harder into her until even more of me was inside her mouth and throat. She took all I had left in her and moved her hands under her stomach so she could hold me.</p> <p>After a moment she turned around and, looking directly at me, bent over and pushed her rear into towards me. I felt her wetness as it ran across my thighs, her back and her ass and my cock. She pushed it into her ass. "Oh my God, you're so thick!"</p> <p>"I know," I chuckled as I thrust harder into her to put her fully onto my lap. "That feels really good!" She pressed back towards me and we started fucking.</p> <p>I could feel my balls swelling in anticipation and felt a finger on my ass as it pushed me towards my first orgasm. Her lips on my shaft were making a smacking sound as my cock entered her mouth and swallowed the rest of my shaft in one lunge. "Oh god!"</p> <p>Again and again she was working back up to me. Her breasts were brushing against my legs as she pushed against me and then reached down and rubbed my hand on her clit and then went around my hand where my fingers were joined by her thumb.</p> <p>She put my cock back in my pants, pulled meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
