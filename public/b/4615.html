I won't let you down." The doctor replied, and pushed his hands between his legs.</p> <p>I knew from the look on his face that he was in for another surprise. I turned on my heels and got my clothes. They were all over the place, plus a few clothes lying in front of me. I put on one of my schoolies nighties, and walked over to the chair and sat down. I heard the front door open and close, followed by the doctor sitting down. The sound of his breath coming in gasps. I sat for a moment and then reached down and pulled the nightie up to cover myself. "Now what?" I think I heard him ask.</p> <p>I looked down at my body and was afraid that it was covered in cum, not sweat, but my wet pussy and thighs were both dripping with my juices. "It's ok. Take a shower if you need to and then come to my office." I told him.</p> <p>"What do you want me to do?" he asked.</p> <p>"You can get dressed, and I'll be back in a bit," I answered, thinking I had a good idea of how it was going to go. I hurried out of the house and had already left for the office. Since it was Sunday, I made sure the place was empty. I went to my car, parked right in front of her office, and turned off of the street in front of the building.</p> <p>I walked into the reception room and was able to see that a man, maybe in his mid 40's, was standing behind her desk. I thought maybe there was some mistake, but could see the doctor was still on the phone, and the room was very quiet. I walked in, and began to close the door. I heard a sound, and then a man's feet and then his head hit the wall behind it. I couldn't take it any longer. I walked quickly over to him, and stood quietly before him.</p> <p>"How long has this been going on?" I asked him, and his voice sounded very strange, even a bit tired.</p> <p>"About a couple of hours. She was having problems with her cycle today. She thinks it's going to be about four or five days before she'll be able to go again." The doctor said.</p> <p>"She has been having problems with her cycle for a while after getting her car fixed. She has been trying for a week now, but then has a breakdown when she starts to feel very tired".</p> <p>"Well, she didn't seem too happy with her cycle today. Maybe it's better to just stay here and talk with her. Her problem has taken her a while, and she hasn't been able to go a week or two." The doctor said. He was looking at me, and I could tell he couldn't help but be interested in my small breasts. I turned around and walked towards the door. I turned around a few times, to make sure the door wasn't completely closed. I walked back in, and walked over to the window. The doctor stood up, with his back to me. I could just see him behind the man, and could see him take off his glasses and put them on. He was very good looking and very sexy. He was obviously only a couple of years older than my husband, and his physique looked good with the shirt on. His hair fell back over his face, and I could tell by the look in his eyes it was a pretty boyish man. They stood there for what seemed like forever, he was getting into it, and when he finally turned around, I could see them start to kiss. I was sure that they were getting a little rough for the occasion, but I wasn't about to complain. He took one step back and looked at me, and then smiled. I couldn't help but smile back. He walked over to the table, got me a paper cup of water, and I took a sip. "What is this?" I thought.</p> <p>"The woman in the room, she's got a headache." The doctor said, and gave a look towards where they were standing. I noticed a strange expression on his face. He seemed to be looking at me intently, and I couldn't help but feel my body growing hotter and wetter with every second that passed. He turned and walked back to his desk.</p> <p>"Well, good luck. You will have time to find out." The doctor said, with a smile, while his eyes were still on me. I guess he was waiting for me to tell him that I wasn't happy. I didn't say yes, but just walked over to them and closed the door. I put my arms around him, and pulled him against me. They kissed. I felt his tongue slide into my mouth and I licked across his.
