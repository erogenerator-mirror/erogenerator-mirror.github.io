She went with me to the small bar, and we headed for the dance floor. After a few dances, we joined each other and did a number. She held me close with her arms around my neck and her legs around my waist, and we slowly moved back and forth.</p> <p>"I couldn't find you, so I went on my own," she told me as we broke the embrace.</p> <p>We danced a few more dances, then we walked back toward the table.</p> <p>"Why were you not at the party?" she said.</p> <p>"What could be the harm? I just thought we could...well, I did go out to grab some coffee or something. Why?" I replied.</p> <p>"Well, that's what happened,"she said with a big smile.</p> <p>I was about to ask if it was because I thought she wasn't there, when she leaned toward me again and said, "You know the dress you were dancing in, and so was the guy you were dancing with earlier?" There was a big smile across her face and I had to nod to make sure that she was telling the truth. "That's his name," she said.</p> <p>"Oh, now, now. He was the one that caught you in the corner." I asked.</p> <p>"And he caught you. And by now, I know you had your clothes off. I know he caught you because I remember." She said.</p> <p>"I know you did. It was him that caught you," I said.</p> <p>"Well, I guess that is all well with me," she said with a big smile. "Now can we go back to my place?" she said.</p> <p>"Sure, let's." And we did. She had to go along with me because I kept walking her to her home. When we got back there, I asked her if she had had any wine and if she had any. "No, I don't, it's way too hot," she said as she got out of the car.</p> <p>I asked her to put on some loose fitting jeans, and she did. After she fixed her hair and reapplied her makeup, I drove her back to her house. A little to my surprise, there was no sign of her in the garage. The lights were on because it was a Wednesday, and the lights were off. I thought that maybe I ought to pull over so I could see what I was coming to discover next.</p> <p>That evening, we sat on her couch watching TV and occasionally we could kiss.</p> <p>"You need to loosen up a little. It's not everyday you find yourself kissing a woman on the lips, but we haven't gotten too far." I advised her.</p> <p>We started kissing again and she got really into it as I ran my hand along the inside of her thigh. "This isn't working out any way good for me," she complained.</p> <p>Then she began, "What's going down here? Is it so wrong to have that kind of power over someone? Why?"</p> <p>"Let's just say, that you have the power over me," I responded.</p> <p>What she really wanted to know was, "How would you know that?"</p> <p>"Just ask," I answered.</p> <p>"I've already tasted your lips and my tongue a couple times, but I haven't had access to more than a small mouthful of your lips. Please, just ask." She whispered as she kissed me more tightly this time.</p> <p>"Well, it's more than that, you're special here. I just thought you might like to try something new. I hope you're not afraid?" I teased.</p> <p>"Please don't tease me. I've been wanting you for a long time and your kisses have been really great. I want to do it again right now."</p> <p>"I don't want to wait any longer. Let's get out of here." I suggested.</p> <p>"Okay, but you better take your clothes off in the car." She said.</p> <p>We got out of the car and she opened the door, I helped her in, and we climbed back in. We looked at each other and kissed for a moment before she said, "I don't have any more clothes." She was really smiling.</p> <p>The next day was Saturday, and the temperature in the room dropped off a little. We had a light dinner and sat around looking at the television while drinking beer and talking. I looked at her breasts and thought that I had found a love object for myself at that moment.</p> <p>"So what do you want to do, or shouldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
