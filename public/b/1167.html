My heart raced and my mind ran wild. When I was halfway down the road I looked at her, she didn't have to say anything. I think she knew. Maybe she thought my heart was beating hard but it went away. She looked at me for a moment but didn't say anything.</p> <p>I didn't want to leave her, I wanted to take her home, she looked so sad too and so vulnerable when I was with her. Her eyes held me for a while and she touched my shoulder trying to comfort me. Before I knew it we were at my apartment, I unlocked the door and we walked in.</p> <p>We walked into my bedroom where I saw her on the bed, she lay back with her eyes closed and she looked like a beautiful angel, like she wasn't scared at all. I tried not to make any noise but she was so beautiful, so sweet. I wanted her to see that I loved her as much as she did. She didn't say a word but she smiled and lay there as if she still could. I was trying to talk to her but my lips went dry and my cheeks were burning.</p> <p>"I love you, I really love you," I whispered.</p> <p>She looked up at me and saw that and I leaned in and kissed her, I opened the door and she looked right into my eyes.</p> <p>"I love you too, I really love you," I whispered.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" she asked, I nodded my head 'yes'.</p> <p>"I'm not so sure," I confessed, "But you know you should be feeling that good."</p> <p>She smiled and hugged me, I felt like she was ready to be loved.</p> <p>We stayed in bed for what seemed like hours but in reality was probably just a few minutes.</p> <p>She finally got up, "Time for you to have your shower", she said and turned on the light. She sat me on the bed. I noticed that the light was brighter and that her eyes were even brighter but I had that strange feeling that she really didn't like me as a person.</p> <p>She took a shower. It made me nervous but then my own body felt good, it felt so good that I could go to bed a hundred times I wanted to and she didn't seem to like that. She washed my hair, I guess it was too much like a massage, I didn't think at first but then when she ran her hands over my body it felt good.</p> <p>I got up to go to the shower while she was doing her hair. Her body looked so beautiful when she was naked and I couldn't help myself but to give a little squeeze. I felt a little guilty that she kept looking at me like that. The sight of her gorgeous body made me think of how she looked in the moonlight, she was beautiful! When I touched her I couldn't help it, I felt the first blush in her cheeks.</p> <p>I didn't do anything, I just stood there feeling the excitement and the heat. She didn't say anything, I tried to tell her but she was looking directly at my naked body all the time, she didn't move. I was trying to control the excitement, but I couldn't. The thoughts of her in a similar state made me feel as if I was losing control. The sight of her nude body made me feel bad, so I tried to tell you that I couldn't stop myself.</p> <p>She came out of the shower and I stood there naked and embarrassed. She took my hand and I took her in her arms. I was trembling, my heart was beating like a drum and I was so aroused by her beauty. If she didn't know I was like that she would have said something but she didn't. I couldn't understand it, I felt like I wanted to run. My feelings confused me like everything else that went on around me.</p> <p>She kissed me on my lips and then she said, "Let's get out of here."</p> <p>I tried to say something, but I couldn't find the words. Our hands explored each other's bodies and I got excited again when she touched my skin.</p> <p>She got down on her knees and ran her hands over my face and I was feeling nervous and hesitant all at once. I wasn't sure what to do, this was all new to me and I was very nervous but all the time she touched me and every step she took made it more thrilling. I didn't know how to react but she pulled my body to hers so that her breasts touched mine, she kissed me on my lips and then she took one of my hands and ran it to her thigh. I started to feel what she was wearing, she looked so soft and delicate. I touched her thigh and then took a finger and ran it up and down her thigh and it was almost like someone touched meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
