He grins in amusement before turning and walking away. She catches up with him only briefly to catch his eye before he's out of sight. She laughs to herself as she follows him, her heart pounding in her chest as she waits for him to walk out of sight. "It's going to be nice to see you again." she says to herself as the door bangles of his heels hit the stone floor.</p> <p>"Just be careful. I'll be back for lunch soon."</p> <p>And she begins her descent home. She didn't notice when she entered the building. She knew what was coming and was dreading it, but decided to wait until she was in her dorm room. Her heart hammered in her chest as she walked her way towards her room. She opened the door, entered the hallway and saw Mr. Harkaday standing in her doorway. He'd obviously taken the time to change and freshen up and he was just stepping out of his bedroom when she entered. He smirked as he closed the door after him just a few seconds before turning around to face her. He's still smiling as he watches her face as she watches his eyes.</p> <p>"I wasn't kidding about the lunch?" she says softly, her tone a little lightened by the thought of him not just knowing she was there but actually knowing and taking advantage of it for so long. "You look like you've just been fucked." he says as he turns to her and smiles. She nods. "I guess you can tell. Or had a few." she says with a smile. "But it's not just lunch either. I've been invited back up here again and I want you to be nice and do what you were doing all day." she adds softly, placing her hand on his arm to push him back a little. He looks at her for a moment as though weighing what he just said for, his smile getting wider.</p> <p>"I have to admit I missed lunch, but after all, it was the lunch that has just made it all worthwhile. I can't wait for Monday."</p> <p>"Oh, good, because I don't have any plans to go back to school today." she says with a wink. His smile widens even more as he watches her approach. "I suppose I'll go on up and see you then?" she offers. He looks back as she walks past him. "Maybe we could use a little company this afternoon." she says and she drops to her knees in front of him. He pulls away from her slightly and holds her gaze with a playful grin.</p> <p>She slowly crawls up to him, kissing his chest, stomach, thighs, and calves. When she reaches his feet, she kisses the top of his foot and licks her way upwards. She runs her tongue up his arch to the bottom of his foot, then licks her way back up. She feels his fingers slide lightly over her ears and then she can hear his soft sigh as he leans back against the couch, his back arching slightly as he watches her. She reaches forward and holds his erection firmly as she kisses and licks her way up to his stomach, trailing her tongue over his skin and up to his neck. She kisses him softly, her hand sliding slowly over his chest, stomach, and inner thighs. "You're really horny as hell." she smirks as she slides his right leg up, hooking it behind his knee and then moving down to his thigh, kissing and licking her way to his inner thigh. She bites her lip lightly, his groan a little louder this time as she kisses his inner thighs and then her tongue comes out to lap lightly over his shaft before wrapping her lips around his head, sliding her tongue over the top, pushing in gently, and then sliding her mouth quickly back to just the tip. She continues to lick and suck his shaft for a few seconds before he begins his descent, his fingers moving to cup her head, one hand slowly running up and down his shaft while the other begins sliding through her hair, his breathing growing and his moans getting louder and louder.</p> <p>Suddenly she stops and stands up. "Oh, no." She giggles and turns around, placing her hands on his shoulders. "Maybe next time." she says with a cheeky grin and sits down in his lap. She looks down at his cock, her eyes looking up into his as she slowly strokes him. "I'm glad that worked out." she says with some embarrassment as she begins to slowly slide up and down his length, her mouth sliding up to the tip and pausing and then sliding down again.</p> <p>He grabs the back of her head, running his fingers through her soft brown hair as she continues to tease him. She continues to slide her hands as she slides up and down hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
