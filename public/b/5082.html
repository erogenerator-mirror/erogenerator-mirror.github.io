She turned and headed back towards the tent.</p> <p>"Where are you going?" I asked her.</p> <p>"I thought maybe we could see that we're not going to have that sort of relationship."</p> <p>"You and your boyfriend?" I asked.</p> <p>"No. I don't want to see you get hurt."</p> <p>I hesitated. "Are you sure?" I was scared for sure that this wouldn't be a pleasant experience for either of us. "Of course I'm sure, I'm just going to take a seat."</p> <p>I sat down at the back of the tent and waited for Ashley. She came down carrying two beer bottles and an orange juice in one hand.</p> <p>She walked to the tent and got the other two beers from another bag she threw on. The first two had me holding them until she got them all wet and had them open in my mouth before she'd even done it for me. She sat the next two down and then sat down herself.</p> <p>Ashley had already placed her hand on my cock before sitting down. She stroked slowly while waiting for me to drink from it.</p> <p>"I was going to take up this conversation with you." I took a drink. While she continued to slowly stroke me, I began to feel a need to ask her about her boyfriend and how they met.</p> <p>"His name was Jack. I don't know the way back home." I took another drink. She continued to stroke slowly while taking her eyes off mine and looking me in the eyes. Suddenly, she leaned over and kissed me lightly on the mouth. I parted my lips and allowed her lips to rest on mine.</p> <p>We lay there for several minutes in the tent before Ashley broke the kiss. I pulled her up to me and she lay down next to me. As she lay down next to me, we began to kiss slowly.</p> <p>"Are you sure we're having this conversation?" I asked.</p> <p>"This doesn't mean you can stop." Ashley whispered as we continued kissing.</p> <p>"I'm not sure it." I whispered back. "I never thought of this as a possibility until today."</p> <p>"You just have to tell me." Ashley said as she pulled my hands up to her breasts. I began to knead her soft flesh in my hands.</p> <p>"OK, I guess we might be going to fuck some more." I said softly as I cupped her small breasts.</p> <p>"I'm sure you have plenty of time to spend with us, and I want you to be comfortable with the situation."</p> <p>"OK." I replied with a smile.</p> <p>I rolled over on top of her and began to kiss her neck and work my way down to her breasts. As I made eye contact with her, she reached down and stroked my erection back to its full length. I felt her hand begin to move up and down its length on top of mine. It was a turn on for me that I didn't even think about the possibility of us getting another erection in the same night.</p> <p>"Would you like to play a little game?" Ashley asked as she reached over and began to touch me.</p> <p>"What kind of game?"</p> <p>"I think it would be something that would end in two parts. Do you find me attractive?" she asked softly.</p> <p>"You are very attractive to me." I replied.</p> <p>"I like your cock. How about you?"</p> <p>"If you want the best thing, it's yours."</p> <p>Ashley seemed to get this from her girlfriend. I was going into overdrive, and not really knowing what to say. I tried to explain that to all that we had been doing. I tried not to think about how we were trying to please each other. I had thought that we might have to do more in my mind, in order to get out of bed in time. I decided that was a good plan.</p> <p>Once again, I leaned back and got up to the tent. Ashley had moved herself back to get the beers out of the bag.</p> <p>"What is it?" I asked as I took my clothes off in front of her.</p> <p>"I don't know what you think it is." She said softly, as she handed me the beers.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I asked softly.</p> <p>"I'm positive."</p> <p>I sat right next to her. We continued to kiss as I pulled her robe down and began to kiss her breasts. After several minutes of kissing and nipple play, Ashley lifted her arms a little as I kissed down her front. My hands began to travel down to her ass, and as I began to kiss her inner thigh, I could feel her getting the feeling of what she was wearing under the robe. She started to moan asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
