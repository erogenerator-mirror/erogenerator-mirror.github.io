She couldn't get the vision of herself so naked in his face before completely losing it. She was aware only of her own body shaking. She wanted it to stop. Her body wanted it to stop. She would have stopped even if the pain didn't stop her from seeing the way this man looked at her and she wanted too, needed to feel something, wanted it.</p> <p>He saw the look she gave him and it made him so hard he didn't know if he should touch her or not. It was a look he couldn't resist if he wanted her and he didn't want it to stop. It didn't even matter that it was him touching her. The feelings he was having for her had left him in need so many times he couldn't help himself.</p> <p>It wasn't a long walk home. It hadn't even been a whole mile yet. It was an hour and a half before they stopped and she started to tell him she was going crazy but the words only broke him. He tried to keep himself from thinking on it but to no avail. He turned to find her on her hands and knees.</p> <p>"Fuck me!" She blurted out. He thought about it for a second and then he stopped. He had his pants off and now he was just taking off his shirt. He had no intention of putting on more clothes but the first one he took off wouldn't do too badly. She was right on his side the second time. He looked over the shoulder of her and saw her eyes closed in bliss.</p> <p>He climbed over her back into bed. As soon as he climbed over her she fell asleep. He didn't move until it was too late and then he lay there with her in his bed, trying to keep going. He woke a little but he knew he was out of some kind of trouble. He was going to tell her he had to get back to work so he started with a few last questions.</p> <p>Why? Could she really be doing this with him? Did she really love him all the time or had she just been playing with her clit. Had he finally found his true love? Did she really want him to hold on forever? He kept thinking of that question and he almost laughed when he heard it again.</p> <p>"That would be nice but I think you might have to wait. I like you and I'm not interested in you being here with me."</p> <p>She knew she was serious but she didn't feel that she had been cheating on him, he had already said that he wasn't interested in her. She didn't know he was as interested in her as she was in him. Did his interest in her go deeper than just looking at her?</p> <p>"How much?" She asked.</p> <p>It dawned on him that he wanted to know what her answer should be. He thought about it for a long time. He thought about it for a long long time. He wasn't sure if he could trust her with anything but he also didn't want to try to tell her that the one person he could trust was none other than herself.</p> <p>"Are you just happy to see me?" He asked.</p> <p>"Yes." She answered, her voice a little lower this time. "I see it as a symbol of how much I love you. You make a beautiful, pretty woman and I love you even more for being with me."</p> <p>He knew there was much love in there but there was still so much that was missing. He wanted to believe her but he couldn't. For some reason he still felt a little guilty. Maybe this was why he hadn't thought of telling her. Maybe she knew how much he loved her? That he really did love her and had been doing something without her knowing about it? He was getting upset by thinking.</p> <p>"I have to think about it some more..." He started to say then stopped. "I guess the answer you might be looking for is not to say anything."</p> <p>That brought her back awake. "What would you do if we were in the park, walking on the trails together for awhile?"</p> <p>"You know I don't like that at all that can't just happen. What if you didn't want me to leave you and see anyone else then? What if we left the cabin with your clothes?"</p> <p>"Oh...OK." He didn't know how to answer this question, wasn't sure he could do that without telling her something of his own and at least it wasn't going to happen anyway with it.</p> <p>'I guess I still think we are going to be together and that the one thing we can do that is love each other." He paused for a half a minute then continued, "There are some things I don't know or understand that would take some getting used to, but I know I love you and I just wantâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
