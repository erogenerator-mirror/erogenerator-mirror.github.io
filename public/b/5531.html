I don't like it. They were just so excited about the other night." The tears began to flow down her cheeks again, he heard it in her voice. The only reason why she was crying was because she was going to get kicked out by her step-father, for fucking her roommate.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. Now you get over your embarrassment of being here with your mother and you will make up for it. You will let me see why she enjoyed it so much, and I promise you, you will be happy. Now please get up and leave me alone." She got up as well and he heard her feet moving down the hallway back into the living room, down the stairs and up the stairs to her bedroom where she started to undress and dress for bed.</p> <p>"Good night, you two have been such good, it only keeps getting worse for you."</p> <p>"It's still bad, please understand that. I know you didn't want to know."</p> <p>"Yes you did, but I am still mad at you. Don't ever talk about it again."</p> <p>"How could you talk about it if you think it was some sort of wrong and that I was not in the right frame to tell you?"</p> <p>"It was all you, the fact that I had made a fool of myself so that I could help you, but I couldn't have done it if I had known you were still upset with me. Now you are going to think that I am a bad person, a pervert that can get away with what he wants and does, but I just don't think that because of that you are a good person. I love you, but if I ever see you in a bad mood again just let me know, it might be a good thing."</p> <p>"I won't hear that again, now lay down, rest a while I will need you."</p> <p>Once again he heard her move quietly between her beds and he knew that she was there, but he was surprised to hear her voice and not hear the sound of her running clothes. He moved in and out of bed for the next few hours until he heard her come out of her room, put his arm around his waist, reached for his cock, and he had his own thoughts of her and his own of his step-mother as he walked out of the room.</p> <p>***</p> <p>After about 10 minutes he heard her return. He heard her come in and then walk up the stairs to her bed. When he did not wake up he knew she was watching some porn that she had downloaded so he opened his eyes and looked at her.</p> <p>"You look tired." She said softly.</p> <p>"No, I'm okay, I'm just lying in bed."</p> <p>"No, it just feels so good to finally be able to watch a porn I just saw." She looked up and saw his confusion and fear. "Oh God, I didn't mean to embarrass you so much." She took off her robe and his eyes stared at her naked body, her nipples were erect and her pussy lips parted as he looked at them.</p> <p>"I saw it, but the video was not where I meant to see it." She walked over to him and lifted his face for a kiss.</p> <p>"No, it is all right, I'm not going to say any more about it just yet, you need sleep. I have an early day tomorrow at a small meeting with a new customer to go to."</p> <p>"I don't know, can you help me get up? I could use some more sleep."</p> <p>"No, you are not going out, I just thought..."</p> <p>"You are such a nice guy Tommy you don't even need to put on your shirt, I think I might just take this upstairs because I'm not sure I would leave my bedroom door open in case anything happens."</p> <p>His hand ran up her leg, he was sure she had no panties on and he was sure that she had some of them on.</p> <p>"Oh, no, I need you to take off your shirt, it may help you sleep, and that it better."</p> <p>She slipped on the robe and pulled him to her as she pulled him down onto the bed. She reached for her robe and he watched as she peeled it off, her breasts were full, firm and she had a good flat abdomen. Her sex glistened and the hair on her mound was neatly trimmed into a neat rectangle.
