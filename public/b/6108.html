"I smiled, feeling myself begin to blush, "and I heard that he's got been in love with your ex-wife for a while."</p> <p>"Hmmm? Is that so?" I asked.</p> <p>She laughed, and we both laughed. We were so caught up in each other, it was sort of like we were on a trip to hell or back, and neither of us could help but laugh when it started. I had no one to blame but myself, and the little things she did, and how she treated me like I didn't matter in the slightest. I was almost always the one to hold her hands, and never make love to her body; not even when we were fucking.</p> <p>She had the same reaction to what I just said. "I don't believe it!" She said. I could tell that she might be feeling a bit shy about something when one of us started to laugh. "I don't think she was happy to hear that about you!"</p> <p>When I got her to laugh again, I added, "I thought she might like it if I had fucked her the first chance I got."</p> <p>I think she agreed with me. "God, I would have loved it." I said.</p> <p>She gave me such a funny little shiver as though she wanted to go over and kiss me, but instead, she reached over and shook me. I was shocked, then, but I wasn't done playing with her so she took it as an invitation, and started to undo my shorts. My answer was that the whole thing was so innocent, but I soon found out that she was serious. As the shorts dropped to my feet, hers left very little to the imagination, because, as we turned to one another to pull them each up, she said:</p> <p>"Oh, I'm so sorry!"</p> <p>"No, I mean... Oh, your legs are so, so beautiful."</p> <p>As she said that, I felt her fingers running slowly down the insides of my thighs, finally, and in turn, I was sliding my own shorts down and getting them right over my feet. I hadn't been so quick to put them back on. I didn't know at that point if I would have thought this through, but suddenly, I knew we had been together, since that first night about four years ago. If we had been the same it wasn't hard to remember now. I put my hands on her hips and we pulled together, and again, I was completely nude. I'd had to work hard to keep myself on the beach to keep my cock from getting all weaped up all over me from our kisses, and then the kiss broke, and I had to wonder if this wasn't just a one time thing.</p> <p>We sat still, and we listened to each other breathing for a little while. "Oh, God! What have we done." She said. "If it bothers you to do this, it hardly seems to bother me any more."</p> <p>"Don't worry," I comforted her, "it's ok. We'll do it right." I went back to making out with her, and she took my hand and put it on her thigh, then slid it up towards her pussy and pressed it right onto her clit and the lips of her pussy. Then, she asked:</p> <p>"What do we do now?"</p> <p>"You want to let me," I answered.</p> <p>"Do you?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes." I answered.</p> <p>With a smile, she ran the tip of her tongue between my lips. I thought I might faint with the sensation as we kissed. My wife is an incredible kisser. I hadn't really believed her before.</p> <p>"What? No." I said.</p> <p>"I... I want to... I want to taste you again."</p> <p>Then, after a pause, she asked:</p> <p>"But..."</p> <p>"Yes, but it makes me so hot doing it."</p> <p>She slid her tongue up to my bottom lip and I could taste myself on hers, and the taste was so different, and so sweet... She slid her tongue gently inside of my lip and ran down to my tongue, and as we broke again to breath, I sucked it into my mouth, feeling the sharp contrast between the two. That got her very hot, and I also felt her hand slide up to cup my balls and gently stroke them as our kiss ended.</p> <p>"Mmmmm." Just then we heard the elevator door begin to open. We broke again.</p> <p>"Come on," she said, "we'll have one round when the door is open."</p> <p>That was a good thing, or the next few days we would be at a party at my house, and that wouldn't be the only reason I would have left off with her. We'd be rightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
