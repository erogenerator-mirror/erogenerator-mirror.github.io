She told me to rub oil in, as she was going to rub lotion in. She started at my back, rubbing it in, taking her time. First, she took some lotion onto her hands and started to rub it on my shoulders and arms, massaging her way down my body. I could feel my dick hardening.</p> <p>She went from my chest, across my belly, to my thighs, and took her time going over my crotch, massaging my thighs and legs. She kept rubbing and touching me like that for a while, and my cock jumped in my shorts and I couldn't hold on any longer.</p> <p>I helped her put lotion on, and she started to massage my legs and my crotch, then she asked if she should do it again, and she started to rub lotion in again.</p> <p>"Oh, no," I said. "We have some unfinished business. I want to do something for you."</p> <p>She gave my crotch a kiss, and went back to my legs. I got back in her rhythm again, and she started to rub my cock again. When she started at the top of my groin, she went down to my crotch.</p> <p>She put some lotion all over my cock, and massaged it in slowly, rubbing her whole hands, then she took her hands down over my balls and started rubbing the backs of my thighs.</p> <p>I kept going until she got to my ass. She started at the top and started rubbing the bottom, rubbing the top of my thighs a little before going back to my cock.</p> <p>"Ohhhh," I said.</p> <p>She rubbed my ass for a few seconds and then got back up my body again, rubbing my chest, neck and face until she got to my face, then she took her hands and rubbed some lotion on my upper chest again, rubbing it in. When she was finished, she looked down at my cock again, and asked if I would like to take it in my mouth.</p> <p>"I...don't know..." I said.</p> <p>She gave me a smile, and moved onto her knees in front of me.</p> <p>"Take your hands back down," I told her. I gave her the bottle of lotion first.</p> <p>She smiled and took her hands back down. Then, I went ahead, massaging lotion all over her back, down into her ass, between her legs and up the top of her body. She spread the lotion out all over from my hands before taking my hands back. She went back out into the store, and came back into the bedroom.</p> <p>I asked her to lie down on the bed, and I started to massage my hands all over. She layed on her back, with her head on her pillow, and took my hands.</p> <p>I kept massaging and kneading her body, while she kept massaging her breasts, rubbing her fingers in her chest.</p> <p>She let my fingers slide across her nipples, and said, "That feels really good."</p> <p>I asked if she had a vibrator, and she said she kept hers there, but the first time we were to use it she always kept it in the bag.</p> <p>As we massaged each other, I asked her if she enjoyed my hands on her breasts. She said very, very sure.</p> <p>I asked her if she liked having sex with me.</p> <p>She said, "Yeah, I liked it a lot."</p> <p>She continued caressing her breasts, with her back arching, pressing against my hands. I took a finger, and ran it through her nipple and massaged her other breast. She closed her eyes, and kept fingering her own nipples softly.</p> <p>I asked her if it really hurt when she had sex with a guy. She said it didn't.</p> <p>I asked her if I'd hurt her if I took her in her asshole. She giggled and said yes. She said the only one was in there, and that she had only had it once or twice.</p> <p>The one-time was her first time, and I put my hand in her hair while she was sucking her breast, and she told me later that it felt awesome, but she liked it some other times.</p> <p>I asked her did she want to get fucked in the ass. She said "maybe."</p> <p>I asked her if maybe she'd do me some good by fucking herself in the ass, and she said, "Oh, I think the other day I would like it. I really like it there."</p> <p>I asked her if she got sore after a while.</p> <p>"Only a minute or so," she said. "It feels good, sometimes."</p> <p>She gave me her panties and bra again, and I went to get themâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
