I was the boss. I had his wife and they had me all to themselves. I could never let things happen like I did now.</p> <p>"It would make one fine woman," she said.</p> <p>I nodded. It made me proud to be able to control my urges.</p> <p>"Would you ever let me go out? I have to have a cigarette. I've a date this weekend."</p> <p>It was such a strange scenario. Her husband had agreed to go out with her but he was the boss. How did I know he would want to do this. I couldn't let my imagination go away while these thoughts raced through my head? What sort of a relationship would we have if I let two men go down on me?</p> <p>"But I won't let you go outside," I said.</p> <p>She smiled. "Oh, I think you want to go out with me."</p> <p>That did it for me. I was going to have one of the hottest girls I knew in one weekend. She wasn't going to let me out of her sight.</p> <p>"But you won't let me walk out on you? Is that it?" She nodded.</p> <p>"It would be so nice. It wouldn't be like this, wouldn't be like these men."</p> <p>"I thought you liked it. I don't like being tied down," she said.</p> <p>I chuckled. "I don't, just like this," I said. "But I do like my own man. Not too much to it. Not too hard, at first. Not too big, at first, but it's just fun."</p> <p>"Like this for your first time?" She nodded.</p> <p>"It would be so fun for the both of you. How long?"</p> <p>She grinned. "Long, maybe even a couple hours. I still have a few inhibitions."</p> <p>"I'm going to have a great time on this trip. If you are a good girl, I will let another man fuck me for one of those little fantasies."</p> <p>I blushed. I was sure that the thought of this stranger taking me back to our hotel room and getting on our bed with him all night had made my pussy wet. Now I was going to be his to do with as he pleased. I couldn't let my little fantasy have such an effect on my marriage. It was the kind of fantasy I thought I'd want to experience with my next lover.</p> <p>She giggled. "You really shouldn't be saying that. I mean, you didn't tell all these things in this room. Have you been sleeping around."</p> <p>"It's not what you think," I said.</p> <p>"You are so sweet," she said. "But if I don't do this right, and you don't like it... just take me back to your bed."</p> <p>I grinned. This couldn't happen. She was my best friend. It was just a fantasy and I was hers. In the end, it couldn't. What if my husband found it hard to believe it? Then there would be a bad scene in the paper. Then I would end up being a slave to her. She was going to have me, just like the two married men. They would treat her like a queen.</p> <p>"So?" she said. I nodded.</p> <p>"Go on," I said. "But leave that door open. I'll unlock it."</p> <p>She looked thoughtful.</p> <p>"It will be fun with you," she said. "I'll undress and then you will join me. You won't know."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes. This is my game. I don't even have the door open."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"Let's wait for your first time."</p> <p>Her face was smiling now. "Yes," she said. "You are so sexy and so wet." Then her face turned serious. "I am so, so turned on. I think I might get so wet, I think I might cum." I didn't know if all the inhibitions that were present were going away, or if she truly was talking about something else now. In any event, I couldn't take my eyes off of her, and I knew she could too.</p> <p>"I never wear this when I don't have my clothes on," she explained. I nodded.</p> <p>She grinned. "This might be fun. I like it. Like you. Like the man I've been with for more than ten years. It's so, so exciting." We were talking about the same guy, it's just different.</p> <p>"Let me turn it on and you can undress," I said. She smiled, looking around.</p> <p>"No. You put it in," she said.
