But I was a cock-tease, and if my cock was going to bust out there, I wanted to be proud of it.</p> <p>I had done my job, and as much as I'd do anything else to prove my devotion to my job, I needed to see it. As I was getting dressed and putting my suit on, I decided to go back to the office and tell him I'd be there for a few minutes to let him know I was on my way. I had told him on Monday before I left that my flight would probably be in and I would be in town and couldn't wait to get back to his room. If possible, I could also say I should come in and tell that he'd left the office as I was leaving.</p> <p>I knew that was going to happen, but I was hoping to do that more than once, and even more. My cock, at its largest as it were, almost poked out the top of my briefs, and I had to pull it down to try to conceal it. I figured if I wanted to make him happy on Monday, I could have him and then maybe show him I was in love with him again.</p> <p>I walked back to the office and walked outside. When I got there, my cock had almost hit the floor. I was hoping I had not caused any damage to the suit, but it had been all I'd left over. It was a black dress shirt and slacks, and while the slacks felt real, they gave the look that I was looking for, not sexy and not slutty. He would have to feel better about wearing a suit for a few days, but nothing was going to detract from my cock any longer. That was going to be hard to find in the outfit I'd chosen.</p> <p>I sat in the car and looked at myself in the mirror. For once in my life, I was wearing a suit in public, and there was no one to walk passed me on the street or give a whistle when looking in a mirror. I had to wonder, however, what the neighbors would think if they saw me in the outfit that I'd decided to wear today. It looked as good as it felt. I knew the way I was walking would cause some of these neighbors to get to the window, and if they saw me standing there in the outfit with my cock hanging out, I thought it would just be all the better to have them look. I even thought I could see how much I might drool on the other side, even though that was probably the only reason I did it.</p> <p>When I got home, I put it back on and checked my email. I hadn't made a call in three days. There were more than just a dozen messages there. They were from people that didn't know me, and I didn't hear back from them. I hadn't gotten a text from Brian over the past few days, and I had to hope that he was fine in the end because if he were, I'm sure he wouldn't want any woman he didn't know to see me in the outfit he was going to wear for me. I had two ways to go with that choice: to tell him that I'd left the office, or to make the most of it. I knew that if he said nothing, I could tell that Brian had made the decision for him and was going to go along, and if I didn't care, what difference did that make? I couldn't wait for Monday.</p> <p>Monday morning came and went, and when I got to the office I didn't have time to hang around, because I had to go home and take a shower. I showered, but when I got home another message came through and it was from Brian. I couldn't wait. I didn't want to see what was going to happen tonight as Brian was leaving work. I had an idea.</p> <p>I took a shower and put on the outfit I was going to wear for Brian - for the evening. There wasn't going to be anything sexual going on in there, because I had to be sure that Brian knew that I was leaving. I even put on the sluttiest little outfit I could find. When I walked into the room, it was dark, and it certainly wasn't Brian or anyone else in the bathroom. I don't think I'd ever have expected anything else.</p> <p>I closed the door, and I sat down on the toilet. I had an idea, but there was a better one. I got up and walked out of the bathroom and across the room into the bed room. I didn't wait for my hand to be anywhere near the bed that Brian was sitting on, but when I got there I had no doubt about oneâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
