The cold hard wooden floor boards caress his skin as we walk past each room. On the first floor there are stairs leading through a small hallway, and then an open doorway at the end of the hall. After about half an hour of walking we get to the end of the hallway and enter a large room with a couple of bedrooms, a kitchen and a small utility room off to his left. At the moment, however, everything outside of this room has been blocked out.</p> <p>"This is my bedroom, and where there is a door for just the bedrooms, and the kitchen for the living room." I say as I lean against the wall and take Jason's hand and lead him down to the bedroom. It's dark and the room is lit with the streetlight that we left on the ceiling. He hesitates for a few seconds, then steps toward me. I wrap my arms around him and pull him close until our bodies are touching. One arm is between us as we kiss. He can smell my cologne and it drives us crazy.</p> <p>Our lips leave our embrace, and he leans back to ask for another beer, and I can do the same to him. We drink a little more beer and chitchat for a bit, then step back to watch the movie. Jason sits down on his bed and crosses his right leg over his left, as we watch it. I turn so that I can sit back on the bed beside him and he can lie down with me and I kneel on the towel. His eyes are closed as he relaxes in my presence. I start the movie again.</p> <p>Soon after, we get off the bed and go back to the couch. We go through one more set-up and now it's time for sex. I kneel beside him on the couch, my hands trailing up his legs, my fingertips stroking his cock through his boxers. I sit back on my heels, put my arms around him under his right arm, then slowly run my tongue from the base of his cock to the opening of his boxers and then around the head. Jason groans and I can feel him quivering below me. My tongue moves around the head of his cock as it gets harder with his excitement. I then slide the head between my lips, then run it slowly in little circles. Jason reaches his hands up to my head, his fingers lightly touching my hair, and cups my breasts softly as his fingers tweak my nipples, making them hard. I move the tip of my mouth down the side of his cock and suck it deep into my mouth, and then move back up, engulfing the head, sucking gently yet firmly. This is not a hand job, but is another demonstration for me of just how I can give a blow job. I slide a little further down his cock and repeat the technique on the remaining part of his shaft.</p> <p>This time after a few minutes of working his cock, I move a little higher to blow him. Slowly, I use my tongue to trace the head, then lick around it, then down to his balls. My tongue strokes his shaft, the head of his cock then parts my lips as he thrusts downward into my mouth. He has a very hard cock, and I can feel it in my hand as my tongue works in tandem with the blow job, and it is a very erotic sight that I would love to have happen to me in the future, especially if it is as good as this one was.</p> <p>I get up and move over to the edge of my bedside table. The candles in the drawer are all full of them, lighting a warm summer breeze of blue and green across both sides of the sheet covered bed. I kneel beside the bed and remove the panties, laying them on the bed next to his boxers, then lie on my stomach on the bed next to him. My right cheek comes to rest beside his face. Jason takes my right cheek in his hands and turns my face toward him, moving his face lower toward my ass.</p> <p>I can't lie to him, can I? I have been thinking about this since the first time we fucked and now that we are both on the same time I'm not sure if I can keep this up. He's looking at me very intently, watching me play his hands over my body as I slowly push the panties from my body. As the last of the fabric slips off my shoulders and down over my ass the back of it lands just over my hole. With a very teasing smile, I bring my other hand to my breast, squeezing my nipple as it goes from hard nub to tight little bud in less than a minute. He is watching me intently, and I can feel his cock getting harder.</p> <p>Slowly, I slide one hand down my body and into my crotch - no panties. While my fingers do this, I slideâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
