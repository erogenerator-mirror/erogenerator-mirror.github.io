You'd much rather have sex with him, so to speak. But you would really like to try it?" She teased him.</p> <p>She knew what she wanted him to do. He'd been looking forward to it. His fingers reached out, tracing the soft flesh of her inner thigh, then moved to her pussy. They slowly circled her lips with his hand, the moist muscle tightening and releasing as it was touched. She pressed forward, wanting to feel his fingers inside of her. He smiled.</p> <p>"It's been a long day." He murmured seductively as his hand slid upwards to her breasts, caressing and teasing them. She moaned and pressed her hips against his fingers. He stroked them, teasing her as they rubbed over her hardening nipples, then circled his fingers over her flat stomach and onto her soft skin.</p> <p>It was impossible, she thought, if they didn't go right, why didn't they just do it right, with him inside of her? They hadn't been very compatible up to that point, but tonight she could feel it. She sighed contentedly as his fingers began to explore, moving to her clit where he gently flicked it and stroked her with his long fingers. She whimpered then, begging silently, but the desire and need would not be denied. He knew she would come if he worked hard enough.</p> <p>With the knowledge, both were lost in a haze of sensual desire as his fingers worked to bring her to climax, she squirming against his hand as his lips encased her breast and his fingers found her clit. She came suddenly, her moans muffled by his lips as he sucked hard on it. She couldn't explain it, but somehow the thrill of her response heightened his own, as he continued to suck her clit until she came once more over his hand.</p> <p>"Please." She breathed, almost too softly, almost to meek.</p> <p>"I'll never fuck you again after tonight." He whispered in her ear, leaning back to nuzzle her neck. "I have another hole you'll never escape." He whispered.</p> <p>They made love at his table all evening, then fucked until she had to go home and crawl up the stairs to fall asleep alone. He left her standing in his office, naked again from the waist upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
