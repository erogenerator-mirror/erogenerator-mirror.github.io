She had the face of a professional model with her eyes the color of the sun. She had to be in her mid-40's and was about 5'5" and 115lbs. Her hair was a jet-black halo around her head. She was wearing a pair of loose fitting black shorts that accentuated her small waistline. It showed off her very curvy bum and those great legs of hers. I also noticed she was wearing a tank top over her perfect breasts which were barely held onto by the material. There was a little cleavage below the material but not that much and just enough to tease when she wasn’t sitting on my lap.</p> <p>“Nice day huh.” I said.</p> <p>“Oh it’s nice to see you” she replied. “Let me get a drink but before you get too carried away I just want you to know that you are not allowed to touch.” She said.</p> <p>I was now very horny and in no better position to think about what she was asking of me. "You’re really a pretty hot woman." I said to her.</p> <p>“You want to touch?” She asked with concern.</p> <p>“Yea I want that.” I replied.</p> <p>“So will you let me touch?" She asked.</p> <p>“Why yes.” I replied.</p> <p>“Ok but don’t say anything until we get back.” She asked.</p> <p>“I will let you but just don’t look at me and keep your hands to yourself.” I said.</p> <p>“Thanks honey. I love it. Go out and get that drink I can’t wait to see you tonight”</p> <p>As she was out of my sight I got up again and went inside. I went to the fridge and grabbed a can of beer for later, and just stared out the window as I went to work. As luck would have it I sat on the porch sipping my beer and smoking my cigarette in the cool night air. It didn’t seem odd that it was in the middle of night. The light of a cigarette wafted through the trees and the breeze that blew across the porch in a cool breeze. I don’t think I have ever felt so alive in my life.</p> <p>I must have dozed off because I suddenly realized I was staring out into the darkness and noticed I was getting hot again. Now I have always had a hard on when I woke up. As I had thought. So I decided to go ahead and lay down for a few minutes in it. At the same time I felt a slight twitch in my shorts. I turned my head and looked to make sure I wasn’t dreaming. I was. And it was nice. I felt a small tingle that seemed to go throughout my body and I suddenly felt alive again as a small smile flashed across my face. After a few minutes of rubbing sun block into my body I looked up towards the cabin. I saw nothing at all.</p> <p>I then decided to just grab my cooler, and go and get a drink and go out on the porch. I stood there until the sun went down. Then I got up and walked towards the cabin. I just stood there looking for a while as I felt my cock get harder again. I didn’t know if it was due to the cool air and maybe the thought of my mystery man next to me but I was going nuts. The only thing I noticed was I was now alone. I put my cooler onto the back deck deck and then walked towards the open door to the back of the cabin. I had never looked like this before, except maybe at weddings or summer concerts. But I was now at the open doorway that seemed to lead to the cabin. After a short minute I turned the knob gently and peeked through the door.</p> <p>All there was was a small table lamp sitting on the table. I quickly made my way up the ladder and took a seat opposite the door. After awhile a couple of the guys came out to use the bathroom. I quickly pulled back the shade as it was quite a distance out and as I stood in the bathroom I watched the guys from about 10 feet away as they went about their business. About then a really cute looking girl walked out of the bathroom and asked me if I was thirsty. I told her I was and she headed off to the kitchen as I finished my beer. I finished mine off and I was feeling very satisfied now.</p> <p>As I stood there I could feel a wetness begin as I drank my beer and my hard on was now almost painful. I walked back inside and made my way back to the sofa and sat down. I felt like everyone was looking at me as I—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
