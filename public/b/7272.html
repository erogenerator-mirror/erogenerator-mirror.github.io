Why had she been so afraid, that her ex, the ex-husband of ten years ago, had taken her virginity?</p> <p>"Because I wanted to see you," I replied, "and I'm ashamed to admit this, but it feels nice... when you're with me." I felt like a father again. "I love you, Jessica."</p> <p>"I love you too," she said, "and I've never cheated on you."</p> <p>"No, I can tell," I promised, "I promise."</p> <p>****</p> <p>"So the way things are going with him," Jessica said, "I don't really know what to do about all of this, do you?"</p> <p>"Not really," I answered, "I really like what he's doing. But after what we've already been through with him, I'm afraid I'm not as man-friendly as I thought."</p> <p>"What does that mean?" she asked, "Do I let him do anything to me?"</p> <p>"You're not sure about this," I sighed, "but it's a lot to take in." I had a very strong feeling about what we were now discussing, and it was hard not to admit to something I hadn't felt in nearly six years or more. I knew that I would do anything, anything at all to get her back, to see her back in a light and she was in control again, but I couldn't say that I was sure because of what I was feeling about him. I couldn't say that what we were doing wasn't loving as much as it is loving all that much because of the fact that I was afraid of what I had done with her. I also felt ashamed and betrayed because of the way I was acting. I wasn't sure that this would be the way to talk to her about this, even if it was nice, but I was.</p> <p>She looked at me and said, "I don't even know what you think you were doing, Kevin. I really was trying to help you when you cheated or whatever, but you always get yourself into any way you can. I never really thought anything like that was possible. You're a wonderful guy and you make me proud when you love someone."</p> <p>"Thank you, Jessica," I offered, trying to be sincere, "But I can't say that I'm proud of what we've been through. I think we all know that. But to try and give you what you want, I have to feel ashamed and ashamed of myself.</p> <p>"I realize it's a lot to ask of you," she said, "but I can't say that I regret doing as much as I did that morning, and I would do anything for you, Kevin. If you can keep my interest, we'll have a wonderful future together."</p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 5</p> <p>She had no idea what I was going to do to her. My heart felt like it was going to skip a beat when she put her head on my shoulder and said, "I am so glad that we are getting back together, and it would all be so much better if we knew what is going to do for each other and that it wasn't your doing."</p> <p>"You were doing a lot of things for me," I confessed, "but I think that a lot of things are going for Jessica too."</p> <p>She smiled and said, "I was wondering, since you're not really sure, if my ex had a big cock or a hard one." She paused and looked down at my semi-erect member with a bit of disgust in her face, "Are you just going to stand there and stare until the end? I can see that you're not going to make me beg or anything so get over yourself."</p> <p>"Sorry Jessica," I replied, "I wasn't thinking of that."</p> <p>"I'm afraid you are still mad about it," she replied, "and I'm sorry that what we were going to do to each other never happened." She paused and looked up so that she could see that it was starting to look like it might have been the way to talk with an ex-wife. "You're not going to beg me that, are you?"</p> <p>"No, not at all," I lied, "but it's no secret that I have fantasied about being with you for a long time, and I guess you can tell that I have something of a thing for you."</p> <p>"Hush," she said, "the more you do for me, the more you can do for me." I felt that she was trying to comfort me some way, and when Jessica felt that she must have been able to do just that, she hugged me so tightly that I started to think that she might haveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
