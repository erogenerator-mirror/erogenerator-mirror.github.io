That will be my wife-to-be,' she laughed, pointing at herself. Then she rolled onto her back and lay flat on the floor, her knees in her lap. With her head on her arms, she said, 'Thank you.' "I do what I can to make you feel good. You'll find out soon enough!' She kissed me and rolled back, laying on her back with her eyes closed as she sighed and enjoyed the feeling of her orgasm fading slowly.</p> <p>I joined her on the sofa. Gently, I caressed her belly as she opened her eyes. 'That's the second orgasm,' she told me.</p> <p>'But the 'old lady' look, the way, the look is that good?'</p> <p>'You bet, dear,' she returned, then, 'My 'husband' feel good and you'll know that as long as you keep doing what you've been doing and that I know that for certain things, I'm going to enjoy what we've done. And the rest of the evening you and the new lady will be doing just what I want!'</p> <p>'What is it?' I asked as we settled in.</p> <p>'She's a 'woman of the world.' Well, just because. She does enjoy sex. Sometimes I just get a hard-on from watching. But for other times it's great. She's a pretty woman.'</p> <p>'I like to keep myself in good shape. That means that sometimes, in the heat of these hot, horny times, I'm naked in bed with a beautiful woman who turns me on as much as I do. So why can't you?'</p> <p>'You were naked when we made you feel good. And a man can't see any woman naked if the curtain is open. I have to be with you, you know?'</p> <p>'Can I keep being naked? I mean, I just hope that you don't mind...</p> <p>'Of course not,' she smiled as she pulled me close and pressed her lips to my. 'You're a woman, too. You're one of my very special men. Oh, yeah. I do get a little naughty sometimes.' She nuzzled my neck and squeezed my cock.</p> <p>'Well, you sure as hell can't, though,' I whispered, and she smiled and pulled away, then put me on my back and straddled me. 'Let me show you your love,' she said, as she began to rub her pussy on my stiff cock.</p> <p>It had been over a year since I'd taken care of the womanly itch she'd gotten on my dick. As I ran my hands along her body, I wanted to touch her everywhere I could. I didn't take very long to get her to the point where she didn't need any help. But she got impatient. 'My love, I want to be your ... your woman? You're not doing anything right, aren't you?'</p> <p>I could tell that she was a little hurt. 'No, I'm doing exactly as I said. Your new lady is not doing anything right; you don't own her, do you?"</p> <p>'Nope, you've got to do exactly what I say, and that'll be you doing the things I say!'</p> <p>She grinned at me and leaned across me so our mouths were next to each other. 'Just lie back, my love. I'll show you more, okay?'</p> <p>She rubbed and rubbed her pussy against my cock as they kissed and played with each other, as I ran my hands down her back and felt the softness of her ass cheeks, and slid them down into her bush. Then I rolled her between me and the sofa so she was lying on her back. 'See?' I said, as I pulled the hair off her beautiful tits.</p> <p>'Haven't you felt so good when you were like this when I came last time?' she said as her hands came up to rub my belly and then she was moving my cock around on her thighs and her pussy lips as she kissed and licked and nibbled my nipples. 'I've never made love in that way before,' she groaned. 'It would not feel right to do anything at all if I were you. But you're so hard that I think I'll try to make love tonight.' She held my cock as she lifted her legs and began to rub the head of my cock up and down her slit.</p> <p>'I think you'd have the better thing' I said.</p> <p>'I might have some lubrication,' she replied. 'And some other things too, I guess. Would you mind if I was on top? I don't really want to go that way.'</p> <p>I could tell that she wanted to go on top.
