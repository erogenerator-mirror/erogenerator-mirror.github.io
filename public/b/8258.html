He was no longer in control of his body. He was lost in pleasure. He wanted to pull away but he couldn't. He couldn't. He wanted it hard. His muscles rippled, tightening. He was losing himself in the pleasure. He couldn't. He hadn't been this hard in years. What the hell was wrong with him? Why had he never taken this path to freedom? Why had this happened!?</p> <p>His fingers gripped his neck hard and he felt an orgasm coming. It didn't stop there. It built, rose up to him, and rose until it burst. He screamed and bucked, and moaned as the flood hit. He couldn't help it. He came, bucking, and bucking, trying to get away from the orgasm. As the flood subsided, he came again to realize that he was on the verge of passing out. He felt like such a loser. He felt so stupid. The one thing he loved about his old life was that he was so far from it now. He'd never felt anything like it.</p> <p>Just as his knees were beginning to buckle, he felt himself being lowered again onto the mattress. He couldn't help it... he couldn't resist. He couldn't. He couldn't.</p> <p>It didn't take a genius to realize for the first time that it was a human male.</p> <p>He was a man!</p> <p>He thought at first that those thoughts made him cry. Then it changed to terror as he realized that he was terrified of his own sexuality. It made him feel ashamed of what he was but it did make him glad that he wasn't getting fucked in just a few more hours. "Oh, God!" he yelled at himself. "I'm a woman. I'm a MAN! God!" He reached for the nearest dresser, grabbed the mirror with both hands, and screamed again. The last thing he heard was "Oh my God! I'm a human male!! Oh my God!"</p> <p>The orgasm didn't stop. It continued to build and rise, and fall, and rise, and fall. He felt every muscle in his body tense as the pleasure was building higher and higher. He thought he might die. Then, the orgasm came and he felt every cell of his body tense as he clenched his fingers into the mattress, cried out, and came again. That sound was too much to believe. He never felt this much pleasure before. It was like something he'd never felt before. He knew he was going to die. He had to take it.</p> <p>Suddenly, he was aware of being turned over onto his back. He opened his eyes and looked up at the ceiling. He felt a soft caress of warm wetness over his face. "Hey," he whispered to no one in particular, "How was that?" The voice was feminine but not feminine at all. He turned his head to see a woman standing over him, naked. Her head was slightly raised and the hair at the back of her head was trimmed with a small arrow, and her body was taut. The woman was naked, and it made him want to hold her. He imagined what her breasts would feel like and he wondered how they would swell up. What would they taste like. He closed his eyes again, trying to think of his own body. He imagined what he looked like on his hands and knees. He imagined what it would be like to have the woman's breasts in his hands. He fantasized his face covered with her breast. He imagined that he could suck her nipples. He imagined his face buried between her legs. He imagined his fingers moving in and out of her sex, in and out. He imagined her hips bucking and his back arching.</p> <p>"You liked that?" The voice asked, again, as she got off him with a smile. It was no longer feminine. It was clear. It had changed. He heard it again. "I didn't hear you call me 'that'." He thought he recognized the voice but it was just his imagination... he had forgotten who it was. He was too excited to register a second's emotion. He wasn't sure if it was about him, or about making love to her, or whether he was dreaming it, or a dream. Whatever his reason, he could not explain why this woman was in his bed and that I wanted to hold her so badly.</p> <p>"Yes," he whispered. "I enjoyed it."</p> <p>"Me too," she replied quietly, as she moved down so that her face was only inches away. The lips of her mouth came down on his chest. She smelled of soap and mint. She sucked the skin between her lips and lightly kissed it. His dick continued to grow, but it wasn't as heavy this time. It seemed to be growing smaller inside of her mouth. The lips of her mouth slowly moved down and sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
