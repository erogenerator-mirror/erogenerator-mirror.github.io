Can I have the keys to the car and take it off for you? I want to come on your leg." I said. With her free hand she unzipped my pants and her hand was soon on my cock. She slowly stroked it slowly and I held her hand. We both had just cum and we were both flushed with lust and love. I had pulled her over to one of the back of my sofa and we were both kissing in a passionate embrace. I gently took her hand and her fingers were on my hard cock again.</p> <p>"Do you want me to take your pants off for you?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I want you to take my pants off for me." She answered with a wicked smile.</p> <p>"Here." I said. She took my hand that was on her skirt and pulled it slowly over her hips. It dropped to the floor and she stood there in her heels. I leaned forward to kiss her lips and our hands stroked each other again. My hand cupped her ass and she pulled me up. My cock was right there so we both moved it to her pussy and she moved her hips up as I entered her. I was gentle at first as I just held her. She was so wet and hot. After a few minutes she moved her pussy up and down on my cock. She turned her head around and said something that got me really excited.</p> <p>"Do you like it?" She said in a very sexy voice.</p> <p>"I like it. How about you?" I replied.</p> <p>Just then I could feel her come again. "Oh no, I'm not finished. I want to hear it all." She said and I could smell her. "Mmm, I really need to be able to come. I just love fucking. Do you want me to come?" I asked.</p> <p>"I do. Come over and have a feel." She said with a wicked smile.</p> <p>She had my pants off and was holding my cock as she looked over my shoulder. "Oh, you are going to love this. I love you." She said with that wonderful sexy voice of hers and then she leaned over and kissed me again. She had my cock in her hand and was stroking it slowly as we kissed. Our tongues met and caressed each other, our lips caressed and then our tongues touched together as we caressed each other's hands. It wasn't long before we were both very aroused and her hand felt good on my cock. We didn't let up at all and kissed and moaned together as our touches started to bring us to a climax. That was quickly followed by our kiss and finally with our tongues and hands we came together, our orgasms flooding each other's pussy.</p> <p>"Wow." She said after a couple minutes. "You are so sexy, you know that? And you made me come too."</p> <p>"Thanks." I replied.</p> <p>We held each other close and kissed like long lost friends. Neither of us wanted to move as our passion kept going out the door. We were both tired and satisfied but I wasn't anywhere near ready to go. I think I would have fucked her the night before. It was the night that finally made the difference between us. I was happy that she was my girlfriend rather than the best friend and that we did eventually have a relationship going. We had just made love to each other and it was more than just getting it on.</p> <p>We moved on and decided that the kids had a big day tomorrow and we could leave in the morning. My bedroom was a mess. I really liked it and it wasn't too much of a surprise that the bed was a mess. There weren't many rooms that needed washing. I told the housekeeper to come out when we weren't in the house so they could sort out our stuff without being there, no work. No problem, we decided to make a couple of trips to get into some clothes just in case. We still had our lingerie and we didn't have the whole house to move. I had no idea where we might even be living in but I didn't have a lot of other options. And I also didn't plan on going out of town that weekend either.</p> <p>It took them two days to unload me and we could leave Tuesday morning. After that the only thing we did was try to sort it all out. By Monday afternoon we were both packed and going shopping. This was so fucking important to me that everything had gone so wrong.</p> <p>+++++++++++++++++++++++</p> <p>The night before was our reunion. It was the first time we had made love in years and it was something both of us really loved and just couldn't do. She wanted to do it at least once and I really wanted to do it more than once but for different reasons. She was worriedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
