I murmured.</p> <p>"I don't know." She grinned. "That's very sweet. Now I know why the other girl didn't get to touch you."</p> <p>"It wasn't so bad. So you're saying we'd have to do different things?" A frown wrinkled her brow. "So this is what is happening here with the other person I want to be with?"</p> <p>"No, not exactly," I said.</p> <p>"A man could not be a man with two women."</p> <p>"That's not true," I said. "If a man is what I want... he'll have to ask first. Do not worry about it, though. Once she agrees to do something, you must decide what it's she likes. If he's not good, perhaps this is best. But if you can't stand to be in love with one woman without a second person, I won't give you this chance."</p> <p>She turned to the first woman. "Is there a rule against it?" she asked me. "Do you know that?"</p> <p>"It could be different."</p> <p>"Yes, but a man has to ask first, right? That is why we are doing it here. It is only going to get more interesting when you're single. There are some things you need to know before you can tell the difference between a woman and a man and a man isn't one of those things. I believe the first woman is the first man we'll ever see." She turned around to show the other woman; the new woman looked very surprised. "I'm sorry."</p> <p>"She's very sweet. And very shy," I told her. "But she doesn't mind if a man gets to see her breasts."</p> <p>"Not really." She nodded. "I'm a little shy. But that is what I'd like, right?"</p> <p>"Yes. Yes it is," I said. "And while I'm at it, why don't you take off your clothes?"</p> <p>"No." She giggled. "What else would you like me to do?" I'd like to take my clothes off... I thought. "But what I'd like you to do," I added, "is to lie on your back on the bed. But not just any bed. Just a regular bed. That is, a double bed, right over the head of the bed we will be sharing."</p> <p>The woman stood for a few moments. Then she walked over to me, lay her hands on my chest, and gently knelt down.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want this? This is what you said when a man is not good? What about me? You're not giving up." One of her hands found my cock and began to roll it back and forth while it came to life.</p> <p>"Do you think I should tell you?" I nodded.</p> <p>"Yes." She smiled at me so sweetly. "I think you should know, too... don't worry." And then she moved on top of me.</p> <p>She spread her legs and positioned my cock at her opening. I felt her vagina closing around the head of me. Then she sat down on it, taking me in. She sat there for a moment, then lifted up again. She held herself there as she rose up and down. Then she sat back down and sat there again, taking that which she had not yet begun to take with her. She went faster and faster as she continued to fuck me in and out of her own pussy.</p> <p>The man came back to the room, and a minute or so later we heard the doorbell ring. When we thought he did not get home very early, he was standing, still naked, at the door. The other two began dressing while he asked me to let him in.</p> <p>It was the first time he had ever seen me in action before. I looked at him and asked, "Is it okay if I stay and watch."</p> <p>The other woman began undressing and I saw some kind of dainty jewelry being dropped. Soon she and Dan were together and the woman on me began moving up and down on my cock. As she sat she put her arms around Dan. He took this as her own and began kissing her as she worked at me. One of the women I'd seen at the door in the bathroom in the middle of the night got naked and led Dan into the room so we could have a good view.</p> <p>I turned and asked, "What's next?"</p> <p>"The other woman wants to make love to him," she said. She got up, kissed her way down my body and then turned around and climbed over my chest. As she moved down over my cock she said, "Do you want thisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
