I couldn't help it..." Gwen smirked, as she let her hair back. "I didn't really mean it! Look, I love you..."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, my love," Gwen shook her head. "But you just can't keep it... you're just..."</p> <p>"You mean, you don't love me?"</p> <p>"No!" the petite brunette snapped her eyes at her as she looked down at herself, feeling the wetness growing between her legs. "I just want you... I've been waiting for so long for this. But I really don't know how you're going to help me."</p> <p>The redheaded beauty stood before the redheaded brunette; and for the first time, Gwen saw that look. Even before this moment, she believed her. Still, her heart ached for the redhead; she couldn't get past the feeling of this hot, petite woman standing before her.</p> <p>"Please, Gwen," the petite blonde whispered in her ear, "I'll do anything."</p> <p>"Anything?" Gwen nodded, already feeling the wetness growing between her legs again.</p> <p>"I want you." Gwen whispered back, even as she stepped further away from this hot woman before her. "Will you please... Please..." Another nervous giggle escaped Gwen's lips. "I... Please."</p> <p>"Anything?" the petite blonde asked, before she gave Gwen a quick look. "Okay, it's okay. And I don't mean anyone else."</p> <p>Gwen felt her heart pounding, but her nerves slowly vanished.</p> <p>Gwen's head began to swim in anticipation.</p> <p>"If it's okay with you... I'll do whatever you say," the redhead smiled.</p> <p>Gwen nodded, as she stared up at her girlfriend.</p> <p>"Please do it," the redhead replied as she slipped one hand inside Gwen's robe. "I want it to make you happy."</p> <p>"Do it!" Gwen moaned, as the fingered her nipple.</p> <p>"I will," the redhead chuckled as she pulled her hand out of Gwen's robe. "I promise."</p> <p>And with that, the redhead slowly lowered her head toward Gwen's pussy, as her tongue slid out.</p> <p>Gwen squealed her shock when the tongue entered her, immediately following the other than the finger. She felt her body quiver, as she realized what the redhead had just done to her. Oh God! Gwen's body still wanted more!</p> <p>"Yes!" the redhead moaned in her ear as her tongue began exploring every inch of Gwen's pussy.</p> <p>Gwen felt the finger slide from her pussy as it began sliding over her lips. The finger had already found its way deep into her pussy, as it quickly began to slide out. The finger entered her again, as it began sliding in and out. Gwen's legs began to shake as the redhead tongue fucked her.</p> <p>Gwen knew she was going to cum. She could no longer believe it. The idea of having someone eat her pussy; to make her cum this way, and to taste that tongue on her lips was just too good! She wanted to cum so bad! She couldn't stop her body. How could she help it?</p> <p>"Gwen, my love, just... Just hold on and cum!" Gwen cried as she began to tremble.</p> <p>And at that moment, her clit began to throb.</p> <p>"Ohhhh..." Gwen moaned as she felt something wet and warm and hard enter her.</p> <p>Gwen felt the orgasm start and then release, as her clit throbbed with each orgasm. Her body was quivering in the heat of the moment.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," Gwen giggled as her shaking continued; but the finger continued sliding into her pussy.</p> <p>Soon, Gwen's legs began to shake, her clit throbbed with the third orgasm of the day.</p> <p>Gwen felt her pussy pulsing as her clit was forced back into her body. "I'm sorry, I can't..." Gwen gasped.</p> <p>"Of course you can," the redhead smiled. "You're going to love how we're going to make you love us."</p> <p>The words made Gwen's pussy feel alive, she loved them. The sound of the heels on the floor, as the brunette got on her knees, and put her face down on the bed; it was too much for her.
