You know how I feel about you, wouldn't you like to have a night of rest and happiness?'</p> <p>"Heather told me how much she loved my mother and how much it would bring her happiness too. If she was as happy as she is right now, then how could she not be happy? She told her all this. She said she didn't even realize she was telling that she would like it but she did know I couldn't say no to her. In fact, she told that she thought that I would be happier. I can help her with that thought too, but I don't know how long it will take, honey.</p> <p>"I said that I would think about it. Heather gave me her phone number and told me to call her later then. With that, she kissed me full on the lips.</p> <p>"My heart pounded as she stood up and took out her phone. She dialed my number. It rang for a while, before a sexy female voice answered.</p> <p>"Oh yes. We had dinner then, but I didn't leave my purse. I wanted to show off my love to you. Heather handed me her cellphone, and I put it down while she talked to her friend. The friend was really getting into a conversation. There was a girl who was going through an affair with a man a few months ago I talked to. As the conversation went on, I could tell that both men were feeling a little uncomfortable. Heather told me she didn't see any reason to feel upset, then they got into an argument. I talked to the man and I was told that it was about the same as my mother's affair. I just got home from work and couldn't wait to see you. I want to see you when you get out of here!"</p> <p>She hung up and kissed me on the cheek and smiled. Then she took a deep breath and said, "Honey, I'm so happy you're home, I really am."</p> <p>"I'm glad I came home. I am looking forward to seeing you, too. You look terrific!" I said. Heather gave me a quick peck on the cheek and took her phone off. We made our way back into the house. I noticed how red and excited her face was when she walked in the house. She was obviously still very excited.</p> <p>Before I could say anything, Mike said, "What's on your mind sweetheart? Do you want to talk about it before we go any further?"</p> <p>"Not until we get home?" Heather replied, and then kissed me again. "It gets a little later." she added. Mike gave Mike a little wave of appreciation and then followed her in her car. Mike drove her to the same house that Mike lived in. He walked her to the door, and she unlocked it, smiling broadly and carrying her purse at the same time.</p> <p>I walked into the house slowly, not wanting to interrupt them. I wanted to see what Heather was doing, but the time was right for me to talk them and make things happen. It didn't take long.</p> <p>"Honey, was at work all day yesterday. Heather has been doing a lot of talking." I told them. Mike's face registered surprise, then was replaced by surprise while Heather nodded a reply. She smiled and said, "Mike and I have been talking about today and about yesterday. I told him what I said to you and that he was going to love it. I didn't know if he liked hearing it from you or not. Mike had already read it on my phone. I didn't let him read it, but I think he could smell coffee brewing! I think he might go to sleep!" While all this was going on, I was getting a raging hard-on. I watched for several minutes, as all of our senses were at play. When I stood, I saw that Heather had removed her bra and was pulling Mike's shorts down. He removed his own and then they were both naked in no time.</p> <p>I couldn't believe my eyes; this girl had the same body from yesterday as she had that morning. Her breasts were small but firm with large pink, erect nipples with large areolas and pink areolas. I just stood there, transfixed. Heather got closer to Mike, and put his hand on her hip. She whispered in his ear "I know that I said that I would love it, and I'd love it anytime you want" as she kissed him.</p> <p>Mike pulled Heather forward and had her stand on the floor so that she could kiss him. I watched them kiss, and Heather pulled his shirt over his head. She then pulled him over to the couch where they were sitting. She kissed him, then slowly worked her way down his chest until she was kissing him through his shorts. She looked closelyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
