What have they done?' The thought was a strange one. On one hand, I could do nothing but lie there and relax. On the other, we may as well have put on some type of display which would attract attention, but no one would notice at all. The next morning we both went down the path to the pub for breakfast. The atmosphere was good: the atmosphere was friendly, there was a few local tourists that I'd had a few opportunities to see on the beach or on the pier. We drank at the pub.</p> <p>We did not have the best view of the view from a large wooden building - the view of the water was quite clear - and I soon saw a group of tourists, all wearing long beach clothes, all looking back at us. Both of us had been there for the last half of the morning wearing nothing but a T-shirt. They made a strange situation of going in the pub, having coffee, then walking around the pub, and finally entering a small square behind a large screen.</p> <p>The first thing that caught their notice was that we were a bit too young to have arrived so early. After having coffee, the tourists came back towards us at the water's edge, but they kept on going without much difficulty because we were standing next to us. We both went inside. The first thing I noticed was that there were a few men out there in the pub with men or more men and women, chatting along with a host of other tourists. They were not in our group, of course - it's how we planned to see them, but if they were, we did not care - they were going. We were chatting at the same time. The second thing was that we were looking at a couple and another couple. As the sun was coming up our way, we looked at one couple for a moment... There were two couples standing in the middle.</p> <p>There were a few people in the other bar: the people could have been in their forties in a beach bar and not a local tourist. But the couple seemed to know what was going on. They kept on chatting, laughing and drinking, and not a couple was missing out on the view of the other couple - not that it meant a lot either - but they talked to each other for real! I could guess, of course, what they were doing. They looked at each other for a while and then came out with a drink from the bar. They talked for a while and then decided they would sit down with us alone, so we joined them in the bar. I was not really sure about this part of their life, but the way they looked at us suggested we were not exactly strangers either. I looked at my watch, wondering whether they had the same idea.</p> <p>Just before nine o'clock, I noticed that our table had been cleared with the two bar staff. As I stood to leave, I noticed a couple walking in the other direction. I also could just see a smile on both couples faces. We walked away from the bar, looking for the same couple. The couple walked up to the counter to refill their glasses. The girl took the money and I did the same. Our table was next to ours. The man who took his drink was sitting next to us. The boy who had finished his drink was waiting to take his seat next to us: we'd finished our drinks.</p> <p>I thought he was the first one to take his seat! Suddenly, I felt my face was starting to burn! I felt shame and humiliation and a sudden urge to cover my face with my hands!</p> <p>'Why were you staring at the man's legs when you could have been fucking him? Are you ashamed of being a slut?'</p> <p>I could not deny this, but it felt like my body was reacting to everything!</p> <p>'Well, he's not a slut, he's not even a boy, he just can't get it up enough to have good sex...', I could feel myself blushing, but it went away quickly, and I could see that my cheeks were reddening too. I had to keep quiet, afraid the effect of being looked at could be too ugly to pass up.</p> <p>I must have looked like a teenager with my cheeks burning with shame and embarrassment. When one of the men came back to our table, he placed his hand on my shoulder. He was younger than the other couple, and we sat down too. I felt my face flush with shame and shame. The man's touch suddenly seemed to have gone from a warm hand on my shoulder to a warm hand rubbing my backside and I could feel myself getting incredibly moist. I could feel my nipples getting hard under my shirt and they would look great pushing on the bra I might wear. When the man saw how turned on I was getting, he smiled and said:</p> <p>'Would you like to feel a woman's legs like mine?'</p> <p>'Whatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
