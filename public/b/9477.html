I hope not. Not as much as you said he would be with you tonight. I'm not about to spend some precious time and money for him. I want this one moment, my love."</p> <p>"You know, we both know I would hate to see him leave, and right now I've thought about what might be in his future life. What if the baby doesn't show up tomorrow, so I have to get away? All the way?"</p> <p>"You have no idea how close your life has already gotten, and if it isn't for your love for me, how would you be at home?"</p> <p>"You don't have a lot of choice. I'm never going back to you in this town. It's always going to be a family. I just wanted to be close to you for a little while. So, yes, this time, yes, I would never leave you. But, I have a question. I want your answer tomorrow, right now, and I don't care where it will go. I don't care where we go from here."</p> <p>I told her we should continue. She asked about the future plans and what they would mean and I said we should talk for awhile. She was worried about me. I told her it was probably a long time before I would ever see him again. Maybe it was a month or so, but when we said goodbye, it was just like she said. She gave me a hug and we sat on the side of the bed. A few seconds later, I was on top of her. She was as tight and warm as I remembered.</p> <p>"I love you," I said and kissed her lips.</p> <p>"And I love you," she said back.</p> <p>Afterwards, we lay in each others arms holding each other for several minutes. Then she said she was tired and wanted to take a shower. So we stayed there. She got naked and I got naked and I went over to her and helped her into the shower. She started the hot water and held on to me as I dried her off and shampooed her hair.</p> <p>We dried each other and got out. We walked over to her bed and she held my hand as she lay face down. I got some lotion and rubbed it on her back and legs. Then I sat on the bed beside her and rubbed the lotion into her back and then her legs. I did the same to her front and legs, and she let out a sigh every time my finger passed over her inner thighs.</p> <p>I put some lotion on her breast and started with her nipples and massaged them with my fingers. That was the first time I had massaged someone's breasts. It had nothing to do with this being the first time I had done it in bed. I didn't stop at her breasts. I started over her belly to her belly button making sure my finger was in pretty good shape. When I got there, she stopped me.</p> <p>"Be gentle with them, I'm not ready for that."</p> <p>I started over to her breasts again and began to massage her as I did. I knew it would make her relax and she wouldn't let me go any further, but, still, I did my best. I continued to roll her nipples around a little as I continued to rub the lotion into her body. Her breathing had started to slow down again. I leaned down and started again on her body. I worked her body under the water for a bit. She told me she liked it when I moved on her chest. If I moved on her breast it would move and she would feel the heat coming from her. I was pleased I was still able to go from the bottom to the top without being too much of an audience.</p> <p>I started moving my hands down her stomach back to her ass as I massaged her. She asked for more lotion and I got it. I started rubbing more and more of it on her breasts while using my fingers on her stomach. By the time I was working on her sides, her ass and back, I was working back to her stomach. She told me not to put lotion on her back or legs. It was a little more difficult but I managed to get her legs. When I had massaged her thighs a couple minutes with lotion, she told me she wanted back rub. I put some more lotion on her ass and legs. She let go of my hand and let me rub her legs.</p> <p>I was working back to her legs again and just as I got to her ass, she reached back and touched my fingers. She said, "don't worry. I like it."</p> <p>I didn't say anything. I didn't know if I could. "I never used oil other than the water, you just have to trust me. Okay?" I nodded.</p> <p>"We don't have to do anything now.
