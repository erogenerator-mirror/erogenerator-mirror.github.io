I like getting your cum into my mouth, though. It really turns me on when you cum. That's one of my fantasies. I can really suck you dry, if it's my mouth."</p> <p>"You mean this is my fantasy?"</p> <p>"Mmmm, yes, it is. You see our little deal?"</p> <p>"I would never agree to that. But yes, I guess you're very, um, talented in that department."</p> <p>"And I have to admit, it's sort of a challenge in this business, isn't it?"</p> <p>"How does that work? I guess this is your fantasy coming true?"</p> <p>"It certainly is."</p> <p>"Well, thank you, I guess. Well, this is my offer. What day would suit your fantasy better?"</p> <p>"Well, this afternoon? I'm going to get dressed, and if anyone else can show up, I'd be happy to escort you and your best friend out to your car."</p> <p>"You promise to pick me up tomorrow morning at 9?"</p> <p>"I won't be able to, but I will be sure to tell Mr. O'Donnell that you're coming over."</p> <p>"Thank you, Mr. O'Donnell. Maybe after I shower and change, he'll come over."</p> <p>"You're welcome, but we still have several hours, no one to interrupt us."</p> <p>"I think this might be a good time to come up with my fantasy, since your friend certainly seems to have gotten very well acquainted with you."</p> <p>"Thank you, I suppose. If you don't mind, though, I think I would like to join you in undressing each other, as we have been looking forward to this."</p> <p>"Oh, please do. This sort of thing requires an element of both," I said laughing.</p> <p>"And my fantasy? Your fantasy?"</p> <p>"Well, I'll just lie on the bed and spread my legs, then reach under you in case you have any doubts."</p> <p>"Oh, I definitely don't have any doubts whatsoever, and I certainly didn't either. I'm not sure my fantasy would be this good for anything, if it were you," he said with a look of amazement and surprise at that remark.</p> <p>"Oh, don't worry about that, it won't be anything I've ever done before either. But that doesn't mean I won't enjoy it, or wouldn't want to."</p> <p>"But there is one condition."</p> <p>"Sure, there is," I said, as I took his hand and lead him into the bathroom where I dropped my shorts and lay on the bed. I told him to take his shirt off, and to me I was just lying there nude. I knew what he was thinking, but I wanted to surprise him.</p> <p>He smiled at me, obviously enjoying the sight of his sexy nude wife lying there, before reaching for his shorts and pulling them off. As he had done, he was now sporting a huge erection. As he said, "Well, I guess we'll see." As soon as he removed his shorts, I went back to my seat, and spread my legs. He was looking at my pussy, which was also in full view of him. I was pretty well trimmed down there, and he clearly knew what he was seeing, as he had just touched my pussy lips, as I had promised to him that day. He was certainly a man to appreciate!</p> <p>The look he flashed me, and I was so horny, I needed to have him enter me. So I moved up on the bed, and guided him to my waiting pussy. I wanted him to drive the full eight inches into me. And he was ready. I wanted him to start to fuck me. I wanted the first few strokes, but I wanted him to put his full length in me. I wanted him to fuck me as hard and as fast as he could. But he seemed anxious. He needed to take his time to get it over with, and I was just giving him more stimulation. He was anxious about the delay in having his full cock in me, the delay in getting it inside my pussy. The delay was actually making me as horny as he was. The more he pushed into me, the more he wanted to do this. I was enjoying this so much I really didn't even need the distraction.</p> <p>I told him to slow down and play with me. I reached over to push a button on the side of the bed so I could get him some better leverage, and he could resume fucking me from the start. I guess the delay was a little too much. He moved a little faster, as he knew I wanted. I was feeling so wonderfully full. My legs were still open. With my hands, I reached above me, took hold of his cock, and pulled himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
