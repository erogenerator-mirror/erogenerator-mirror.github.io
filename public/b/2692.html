I asked.</p> <p>Maggie's mother was still a total mystery. But she wanted to make sense of it all and I wasn't sure if I wanted to tell my friends about that in any way.</p> <p>"I don't really know," Maggie said. "But I'll be there for a reason. Please don't be shy with me about it. And please keep my virginity safe with you guys and our baby. Please!"</p> <p>"You got it, Maggie," I soothed. "Don't talk to your parents or your cousins about me."</p> <p>"But you'll be the first one to break a girl's cherry," Maggie stated matter-of-factly. "We don't have to, though. There's no one else here."</p> <p>"Oh," Maggie said. "I guess we can go," and she gathered her purse and keys, stepped outside, and followed her mother toward the front door. Maggie was very graceful and was all feminine in a way that was a bit unnerving. And the fact that I had just had sex with a woman didn't help either.</p> <p>I drove on to the university and parked on the street behind a dumpster and went to the front door.</p> <p>"Honey," I called, as I rang the bell. "Come in. I've put some flowers on the counter," I said, gesturing toward the flowerbeds.</p> <p>The inside of the house was sparsely lit by a few candles which I didn't want to light. There was a table between two of the windows and an umbrella was in the middle. One of the chairs was covered by a plastic cover that was folded at the front. I didn't even need to push back the shade and it was a warm pleasant scene with a table covered with a couple stuffed animals, two bottles of soda with two glasses of sparkling water, and the living room furniture was white with soft blue pillows arranged around a king-sized bed.</p> <p>Maggie greeted us inside the house with her smile. Maggie was wearing my sweatsuit jacket and the buttons were opened just enough to have a hint of cleavage in it. Her mother wore a sleeveless blouse with a low cut top which showed of her well-toned body, her shoulders and arms bare. A dark, buttoned brownish-blond hair fell in front of Maggie's face, and her red lips were parted slightly. I think Maggie was pleased to see that I was still not entirely surprised at the situation. I was about to ask her mother to leave when Maggie held out her hand to shake mine. With a smile, I shook her hand. She smiled back and said, "Hi, honey."</p> <p>Maggie and her mother greeted each other in turn and I felt a little uneasy as I watched Maggie's mother greet my son.</p> <p>As Maggie had explained before, she was going to be staying at home. I told her that I knew the girl I was going to marry the other day. She agreed.</p> <p>"Does that surprise you?" Maggie asked. "He will be marrying some other girl if they marry him."</p> <p>"I'm not sure I'll be able to think straight on the basis of my own emotions," Maggie said. "I really hate being here!"</p> <p>"Me too," I said.</p> <p>"I know!" Maggie said. "But you don't have to worry about that...the next time we meet he'll be right up to the point where he can start the whole thing."</p> <p>Moments later, Maggie said that everyone in our house was getting dressed as she and I headed for the door. Maggie's mother was dressed in a very feminine outfit which I guessed might have been a bra and panties as she slipped a long, light-green skirt on before opening up the front of Maggie's blouse. Her mom's black blouse was cut very low and the front button was at its center, revealing a very respectable cleavage.</p> <p>As Maggie's mom stepped forward into the doorway, I heard her shout something in which I assumed meant something about "We're almost at home, do you want to go"? We were just coming into town from home. The car would be arriving later.</p> <p>As Maggie and I walked out of the door, we felt our stomachs re-arouse. Both of them looked as if their feet had just been kicked off the footrest of the couch. I knew that our conversation had probably not been meant as a compliment.</p> <p>Once again we were greeted by a warm hug. As we broke eye contact, Maggie asked my parents for their names. They told her the same number and then told her that they would be home as soon as possible and they would take things easy since we had already arrived. It was nice to see thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
