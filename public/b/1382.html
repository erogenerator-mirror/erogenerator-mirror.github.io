I'm sure that when you go for it, all your fantasies come true."</p> <p>"And that brings me to the most common thing in your life." I laughed, thinking back to the previous night, when we had taken a shower together, and he had been so excited that his cock had got hard so quick that he had gone down on me so fast that I nearly cried. I knew that his fantasy had been for me to be here in the hot tub with him but I didn't realize how he had wanted to fulfill those fantasies. So I had gone back downstairs and watched for a while.</p> <p>A few moments later, he came back out and asked me to stand in front of him, leaning up against the wall, so that he could look at my face. I saw his reflection, my eyes focusing on the dark circles under my eyebrows.</p> <p>"Did you like watching yourself get fucked?" he asked me.</p> <p>"Oh yes, Michael. You're the best! I wish I could have been there."</p> <p>"Oh, sweetie. That was fun. I think you just earned yourself a bonus."</p> <p>"I'll try your cock, and when I get back, I might even have sex again with it." I said.</p> <p>"You'd be surprised, sweetie. I bet you wish you had one."</p> <p>"And you're welcome anytime, any time," I said, then, giving him a wink, added, "Unless you want your cock sucked."</p> <p>We both laughed, then I had to get up off the couch and open the door to the hot tub, because one of his fingers had found its way into my vagina and had gone into it, and it was throbbing and pulsing for the life of me.</p> <p>When I went out into the hallway to change shoes, he was behind me leaning, and I could feel his hardness through his pants and mine.</p> <p>"So, what's up?" I asked.</p> <p>"You're still wearing your clothes. What are you doing down at the gym anyway?"</p> <p>"Um... what?" I answered, starting to feel uncomfortable.</p> <p>"Oh. Nothing."</p> <p>"No! You shouldn't, Michael!"</p> <p>"I know... I shouldn't."</p> <p>"Come on, sweetie. No one's forcing you."</p> <p>"Nope. It's not that. It's just... it's just when your boyfriend comes home."</p> <p>"So, what do you want to do?"</p> <p>"What do I know?"</p> <p>"What you must know is, I love you."</p> <p>"I know, I know. You love me," I said, now feeling the tears start to flow down my face.</p> <p>"I do. I love you, and I can't say it enough."</p> <p>"Please, Michael. What are you doing?"</p> <p>"Just come on, sweetie."</p> <p>"I've never done this before, but if you want me to, I'll take you up on it."</p> <p>I was now more sure than ever that I wanted this. I wanted to be able to do whatever this guy wanted and whatever he wanted with whatever I wanted. I wanted to feel my sexuality being touched, and have sex with it.</p> <p>"I want you to," he continued, "but not just to make love to me or anything. I want to lick your pussy."</p> <p>"I don't care!"</p> <p>"Well, I could go as far with that as I want to!"</p> <p>He was right. I didn't care. I wanted it. But, as hard as I wanted to, I knew that I couldn't. All I wanted was his cock in me and inside me and with him.</p> <p>"Okay, Michael." I said, now starting to wonder why he would want to do this.</p> <p>My heart was racing now. I didn't know what I was worried about. I had not been with a man in nearly a month, and while I liked to fantasize about making love, I wasn't sure if I was ready for that.</p> <p>"I'm your man, Michael. I want to make love to you and make you happy."</p> <p>"Michael... Please. This can only lead to what we really want to do. It's not really a guy thing."</p> <p>"No man's going to make that clear to you?"</p> <p>I nodded emphatically. "I wouldn't tell anyone."</p> <p>"No one ever will, my sweet little angel."</p> <p>"I'm scared."</p> <p>"No one will be." He had no idea what to say to me that would really mean.</p> <p>"Then, let me take you upstairs and see if we can..."</p> <p>"No... You can't! I don't want our first time to feel as if I'm a woman, and you're notâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
