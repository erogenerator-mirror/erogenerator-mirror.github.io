Wait! No! We can't have sex!"</p> <p>Marianna looked to her boyfriend's face as he pulled on his pants.</p> <p>"Oh, I do have to have sex, don't I? I mean... we'll just have to do some serious fucking."</p> <p>His hand flew back to his groin as he fumbled around. The only thing more embarrassing was that he didn't need to do anything in return – he had just been horny. There were no other options.</p> <p>"Don't you dare make me," Marianna said.</p> <p>Trying to keep her voice as calm as she could, Marianna turned towards the open door. "Come on, let's get inside! We want to play with our little toy."</p> <p>"No. No – please – come on!"</p> <p>Marianna was a little unsteady but she made it across the threshold and into the bedroom. At that moment, all thoughts of what she called her toy ran through her head as she entered the large, comfortable bed and sat in the middle of it. She hadn't been looking at Jason – just at the scene in front of her, sitting on the edge of the bed, totally naked from the waist down.</p> <p>The situation was such that Marianna looked like she had just been in the hot tub, soaking in the hot water, her skin shiny and wet. Her long dark hair was out of the way and her breasts swayed as if made of lead. The tiny bikini barely concealed her nipples and as Marianna looked around at the bed in silence, she thought about what it would be like to sit and have sex with Jason. Maybe to make love to his big, hard cock.</p> <p>"No! No, we can't!"</p> <p>Marianna's heart sank as she realized that she had been wrong, that she just wasn't in a position to protest as much as she would have wanted to. Instead, she decided to see where that went.</p> <p>"Jason. Oh my," Marianna said as she tried to pull her dress back down, "why can't he just take his shorts off?"</p> <p>"What's the matter?" said Jason in a little-girl voice. Marianna had heard that voice before, as though she were really talking to a baby and he was talking to her. The little girl had come on to her.</p> <p>"This is ridiculous. He can't," Marianna thought to herself. "We can't do this. We can't."</p> <p>"Jason," she said to herself, "no. No. It's not necessary. We can do this now."</p> <p>"Oh, my," Marianna said as she stood up and slipped it back on. "It seems so much easier than lying here. You have to do this!"</p> <p>"No, no, no," said Jason as he shook his head, "we can't."</p> <p>Marianna knew what Jason meant but didn't know why. She knew that it was impossible for Jason to refuse her the sex she wanted – she knew that it would be as easy for him, after all. She just didn't know what she could say that would make him leave, her lover out of it.</p> <p>"Oh, you're right," she said trying to sound convincing. "It was just the act."</p> <p>"No," said Jason, "you had to take your dress off. That's right. All this time you were in this room, all these sexy, teasing thoughts were in your head. It's natural for a young girl to feel these feelings, to have them," as he said these words, he picked up a couple of stray white hairs and ran them between his thumb and index finger, "but you had to go and get those things so that whatever we were doing, it didn't get ruined. You had to get this on! So I'm just gonna have to find a way out of this."</p> <p>Marianna was glad to go back in time and think about how to get out that time and her new best friend Jason, not because of what he had just told her, and not by the way that he had asked her to get her dress back on. She smiled to herself as she recalled how it had felt. It had been easy to turn out in whatever panties and bra she had on, but he had made her forget herself, and she felt such a sudden rush of shame.</p> <p>And, she couldn't believe that he had been so quick to tell her that he would, indeed, take her panties off. Maybe she could come back to her house and try to change things. She didn't want to talk about it – maybe she'd just cry.</p> <p>"Jason," Marianna pleaded as she fought hard, "I'm gonna go and—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
