This was so fucking hot!</p> <p>"I hope there was no cum," I asked.</p> <p>"Don't you want me too?" she breathed.</p> <p>"As well as I want you...just keep doing it."</p> <p>She sucked on it some more, her hand sliding up and down my shaft. It was hard, hard and slippery, her mouth wet and open as she rubbed it on itself. Then she brought it to her mouth and slowly let the head enter her mouth, closing her lips on it as she swallowed it. I could hold off no longer; I groaned as she sucked on me, my hand going on autopilot now, my fingers working at her vagina to get at her clitoris as I felt her legs begin to flail as I pressed the head into her open lips. She moaned, the vibrations of her groan driving me on. I could feel it too.</p> <p>"Oh fuck!" I groaned, as I felt my cock spurt, spurting my semen into her mouth. I saw flashes of light as it went into her, a soft 'shuddering'. Her legs flailed, her arms flailed and I could see the muscles on each limb twitch from the force of the contractions. I was sure she had orgasms too, but I couldn't see for certain. She was in the middle of one as I spurted a load into the air and she opened her mouth wide and gulped it, as if she were gulping it as it was my cock. I was amazed that she could so do it, so easily. I could feel the fluid oozing from her mouth and I could smell the scent as I did so, it was something special to be able to do that. I lay back on the bed, enjoying the warmth of her on me. She was leaning on her back, with her mouth wide open, her tongue lolling around it as she stared at me.</p> <p>"Well?" she asked.</p> <p>I was thinking back to the first time I had heard her, my mind going somewhere else as her mouth opened and her lips formed a seal as I said: "I...I didn't make a fool of myself like that, but...you did." It was the first time I spoke to her like that and that it felt so fucking good.</p> <p>"Sorry; I'll keep thinking."</p> <p>"Me too." I was not sure what she meant. We lay there for a while, holding each other, kissing, talking. This was the first time I had felt her lips on them, I was wondering what she would say when she wanted to say it. But that is another story…—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
