I could still feel her tongue and lips as our mouths moved together, and there was a touch in the base of my cock – not as a finger or tongue – but like a real cock. There was no mistaking what it was, and there was that sexy cock. I knew that touch, of course. It would just be just as she knew that I wanted her body.</p> <p>She pulled away from the kiss and looked down to my crotch: "Oh - you're getting hard again," she whispered before she gave me a long kiss.</p> <p>"I haven't had sex with anyone in over two days," I answered, and then I grabbed her face and said, "I'll keep it that way, but it would appear we're already committed to the next step, haven't we?" I kissed her again, this time her lips.</p> <p>She pulled away and said, "That was a little hot."</p> <p>We stayed together like that for another several minutes, sharing the music with each other. Then I stood up.</p> <p>"Come," I said, as I turned my back on her, and she stepped around me. Then she moved to the bed, and lay down. The music came on again, and then she began to slowly dance again, the song moving across the landscape. I watched her, still on her back with her head toward me, and as she moved the music changed, and I could see she was enjoying herself. And she started to smile – that little girl smile that says, "Come close to me, and let me hold you." And I could see from the way her eyes looked at me what she meant.</p> <p>She raised one foot to the center of the bed, and let her other hand fall to the floor. She spread her legs wide enough that I got a good look at the shiny wetness between them. I could see that she had a little more than her fingers inside of herself, and that all of the juice was slowly oozing out. She pulled that little pussy toward me as she danced, and the look on her face told me she was loving what she was feeling.</p> <p>"Do you like that, baby," she asked, with a slight smile.</p> <p>"Yes," I whispered.</p> <p>The slow music ended, and then I turned my head to look at her again, and she raised her arms.</p> <p>"Do you want to taste your come?" she asked, and she smiled with her eyes. "I'd love to taste that for you." She smiled and moved to lie again, and I crawled toward her, my eyes feasting on her body. Her breasts were full and soft, the nipples hard and pink, and her bellybutton was a lovely pink colour with just a tiny triangle of hair. Her legs were wide, and her feet were flat on the bed. Her hands were at the backs of her knees, and she pushed them up. I moved up toward her, still on my back, and my cock was pressing to the bed as I settled between her legs. She took her arms away from her ankles and spread her legs wide. "Do me," she urged, and I moved in, slowly, gently and steadily. "Your cock has been at the right height, doesn't it?" I nodded.</p> <p>"God - yes," she said, as I slid my arms around her and caressed her back. I had never had a woman this way before, and there wasn't any denying that I desired her. My mouth pressed to her breasts, and she could feel my lips pressing to her, her nipples stiffening under the pressure of my kisses. Then she pulled the sheets over us and let her head fall back a little. I could see her breathing again, and my cock was straining in expectation, and she reached out and guided me into her.</p> <p>"You ready now?" she asked, as my cock began to stroke her insides.</p> <p>"Ready," I echoed, and then added, "Let me watch." And I moved off her, kneeling between her legs. And with one hand I guided my cock into her as I pulled her down to me to kiss her as I started to slide in and out of her. "I am coming," she said. I kept rhythm with my cock in her—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
