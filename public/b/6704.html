" I can barely hold back a moaned out loud...I love this position.</p> <p>"Mmm...that was good, baby. Are you ready for it? Are you ready for me?"</p> <p>"Oh yes. I'm ready." I am breathing hard, the air on the walls is hot, and I want to hold there. Her hand comes up to grasp fist full of my hair and pulls me closer. I want to moan her name...I want to feel her lips, her pussy surround my cock...I want to feel the sensation of her mouth on my cock...I want to be inside her, but...</p> <p>"Shhh," she soothes my hair, "Don't think. This will be as good as you can be...as...you've known me as my daughter until I left, you just want me to be a part of you...to make love to you...you want me to kiss you...want me to make you feel what you've felt...I want your body to be hers, for as long as I am here."</p> <p>"Oh god...that's what I want to feel...and more than that... " She runs her hands along my back and the backs of my thighs...my ass, my legs, my stomach...her fingers trace across my chest to my stomach...and down to my cock, she lightly caresses my flesh...and around to my hip...my legs start to shake and my knees feel weak...and her fingernails touch my balls...down my inner thigh, as my cock jumps and flexes with each touch. My chest starts to tremble as she brushes her thumb over my cock, and she can feel it as it pulses through the air. She feels the ridges on the head, the veins, the pulse, and a low throaty moan escapes my lips.</p> <p>"Baby you look so hot...my God...my daughter's little girl. But you're so beautiful...I have always wanted to make love to a woman like you. I want so much to make love to you...to take all of you...I want to make love to your little sweetheart...make you scream with passion and ecstasy in front of my friends...I want you to be mine..."</p> <p>"Please...don't call it that...you...my daughter has called it by her friends...but I love it...I love you...I want you to be special...I want to fill me up. Make me feel what other women are going to feel..." "Please...call it that...baby... " she whispers in my ear, her fingers trace light little circles with her thumbs...over the line, I think...but her hand stops...to trace her fingers over my cheek, and her lips meet mine and tenderly kiss me.</p> <p>"Babygirl...now get your clothes off. Let our first time be special... "</p> <p>I have my shirt off in a flash. It tucks itself in a little, but not so tight I am not embarrassed. I just can't get enough skin on skin contact. I can barely move, and my nipples are erect; and my hand slides down to my cock and it twitches. I am shaking as she takes off her shirt and tosses it to the floor. She's the sexiest girl I have ever known, and I think I can't believe how good she looks. But then again, I've only met her for a minute after she caught me jacking off at one of her classes. She gets my shorts off, and I don't know why she seems to do this...and all she is wearing right now are her jeans and heels, and the panties she is wearing. There is a small wet spot on the front of them where my pre cum has come out...but they both come off easily...and she's not afraid to touch me, so I let her; it's ok.</p> <p>"Turn around, baby girl, " I turn and she turns to face the foot of the bed. We kiss again and she pulls the fabric and panties out of my hand and down around my knees. She pushes me over on the bed, her long hair covers me, and she's in a sexy pose.</p> <p>She has stripped off her panties this time, and she lies down face up on the bed. She is waiting to be dominated and taken for what I thought was, but now I am not so sure, and I am unsure I would be the one for her to do what she wants to me.</p> <p>She lays on her side on her back, looking up at me with a smile that could melt steel. She opens her legs to me and reaches for my cock, where she can't see it, which is pointing at the ceiling. She puts it in her mouth and I feel her tongue licking the head.
