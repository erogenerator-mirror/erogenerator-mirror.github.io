My hands slid between her thighs and up to her puffy labia and in my eagerness she opened them, allowing me room to explore. My finger found her engorged clitoris and I flicked it with my tongue, causing her to gasp in a small orgasmic moan.</p> <p>Sitting up slightly she pulled her breasts from my face and I saw her smile. Moving to straddle my hips she guided my cock to her waiting lips and slid it in deep in one movement. The look of pleasure on her face told me I was right at home as the pleasure from her mouth was divine. Sliding her body up and down on my cock she began to moan into my mouth, as her body stiffened and her legs kicked straight out, she climaxed and came hard.</p> <p>Her body collapsed on my chest as her passion built, and I felt myself stiffen in her cunt. Holding tight to her I emptied myself into her body again; she was moaning almost in pain of this intense orgasm. When she finished I gently lowered her to the bed and held myself, my erection still throbbing against her body. Moving her legs so that she lay on her back I kissed her soft belly and the crevice under her breasts. Her body shuddered as I licked her breasts, and she lay there gasping for breath.</p> <p>Taking her arm I pulled the pillowed frame from the bed and moved it out of the way and off the floor. Sitting back on the bed I pulled on the straps and rolled the top onto the pillow. Then pulling her head back and kissing her deeply I began to unstrake her ankle restraints.</p> <p>Standing she pushed me away, and I fell on the bed between her legs. Reaching under her I took her breast in my hand and began to lick the nipple, sucking and licking the flesh in my mouth. Releasing the nipple I kissed down her belly, my lips and tongue caressing her soft belly and navel.</p> <p>Releasing her breast I began kissing her mound, licking up its underside. Continuing further down I kissed her clitoris, working my tongue over the protrusion as my lips and tongue worked on both sides of her clitoris. Lowering my head in the middle of her pubic hair I pushed my tongue into her.</p> <p>Kneeling on the floor of bed I licked her labia, pushing my tongue deep into her with each pass. Releasing them I pushed my tongue into the tight opening between the folds. Licking my way from the bottom of her vagina up there to her clitoris, I worked all around it with the tip of my tongue, flicking it back and forth and in circles. My head bobbed up and down on her pussy and her hips and thighs bucked against my mouth.</p> <p>Her hands found my head and she pressed it to her cunt. My tongue lashed her clit and her hips bucked and thrust. She bucked harder. I felt her body go rigid as the orgasm ripped through her. Juices burst from her body, and her whole body shuddered, her breasts were heaving in my hands. I held them.</p> <p>Resting her legs she allowed me to kiss her mound. Liducal sensations swept my mind. When I reached for her vagina her thighs tightened again. My fingers were between her folds, and my right thumb sought her engorged clitoris. I circled it with the tip of my tongue. As I rubbed it with the tip of my tongue, her body trembled under my attentions.</p> <p>She was ready. Releasing the clamps on one hand, I positioned myself between her legs. Kissing her legs and buttocks I slid my cock into her. Her legs wrapped around my waist, and my cock slid deep into her body as she held me against her body. As we fucked I reached around to caress her breasts, playing with her erect nipples as we fucked. I pushed her back over the bed, holding her around her waist, and kissed her on the mouth as my cock stroked in and out of her body.</p> <p>Our bodies seemed to synchronise with each stroke, as our bodies were becoming one, as our bodies, and only this moment existed.</p> <p>When our climaxes finally arrived I pulled out of her body, and lying next to her I caressed her breasts, and pushed her thighs into her chest.</p> <p>"Now," I whispered in her ear, "You have to get dressed. We have the next day and night's session tomorrow. I must dress quickly before they wake up."</p> <p>She nodded and kissed me. Our bodies came together again, as we began to cum, again, in my arms. We rolled over and she lay on me, my hard cock sliding into herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
