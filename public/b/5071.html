You're the best," she murmured as she lay beside him, kissing him gently. He ran his hand along her cheek and lips. "I can't wait to get it up again!" She groaned as her body shuddered in anticipation.</p> <p>He didn't tease her or tease her or do anything that would make her forget about him even if it meant she went off the pot as well. He just wanted to feel her. "What ever makes you feel good like this," she murmured, "tell me."</p> <p>He kissed her gently and continued to caress her face and lips, running his fingertips along her shoulder blades, down her neck and into her hair as his hand softly and expertly stroked her breasts as she sighed and moaned beneath him while he kissed and nibbled her neck and shoulders.</p> <p>"That's it sweetie," she murmured, "be a good boy and suck on my tits ... ohhhh!" She wrapped her fingers in his hair and pulled him gently up to kiss him.</p> <p>He turned her over, facing each other on the blanket, and took a nipple into his mouth. She arched and cried out as he sucked and bit gently on her. With a quick movement he flipped her over and straddled her body as he knelt down between her legs. With a quick motion he slid his cock into her easily as he leaned to kiss her. Her eyes opened wide as he slowly fucked her slowly and smoothly. The feeling of his cock sliding back and forth inside her drove her wild with desire.</p> <p>As he began to fuck her slowly, he felt her cunt contract each time he entered her. She cried out softly in ecstasy as he felt her heat spread to his cock. He moved forward until he could feel her cunt tighten on him as she grabbed onto him, arching her hips in response to his thrust. With a thrust of his own, he slid into her as low as he could go and felt her cunt stretch to accommodate him.</p> <p>"OHHHH YES! YES! FUCK me! Oh, yes, fuck me!" she screamed, "Yes ... fuck me ... fuck me ..."</p> <p>Her cries grew louder and her pussy contracted powerfully around him as she felt waves of ecstasy flooding her body. He felt himself grow and stiffen as he pulled her tightly to him and slammed his cock as far into her as it would go as he came. He leaned forward, burying his cock inside her and feeling her cunt clench tightly around him with each load of his come.</p> <p>They lay silently in each other's arms as they caught their breath and came to a decision. "Let's go back inside and go for a swim before we go back to being just friends ... or maybe we can go back to being roommates, if you still want me as your boyfriend!" He gently kissed her and looked lovingly into her eyes as he moved back to lie beside her</p> <p>"I'm not gay ... we'll have to sort things out and deal with it... but you know how I feel about making a deal with you ..."</p> <p>"What deal do you have with me?" He asked, "I thought I had made a pact with you."</p> <p>"You do?" she said smiling.</p> <p>"Yeah ... I do," he said. "I got it from your mom and dad and then your uncle."</p> <p>"Oops," she smiled, "I forgot ... he can't really remember ..."</p> <p>"Well, he sure as hell will," he grinned.</p> <p>"Oh boy," she murmured as she pushed his shoulder.</p> <p>Chapter 4</p> <p>They made it back to the motel and then settled down on the sofa and watched a movie. Once they had downed their coffee and had rested a while, they started talking and joking as they started their third bottle of wine at the end of the day. They were just about to watch the second tape when they heard an on-screen light go on. "How's that?" Mary asked.</p> <p>"Perfect," Chris agreed. "It's been a long time since I've been with someone this happy."</p> <p>"So I hear," she gushed. "I'm glad you brought an overnight bag over for us."</p> <p>"Oh, you're so sweet," he replied, taking her into his arms. "I couldn't go out with a bunch of girls this excited, could I?"</p> <p>"Nope," she smiled. "I don't think I'll ever leave my mom."</p> <p>"Good for you," he said with a laugh.</p> <p>She leaned towards him and kissed him slowly on the lips. "You're going to make this one of the best ones ever. Where did you learn to fuck like that?" She leaned over and kissed him again and sighed when the kiss was broken.</p> <p>They watched the movie and sipped wineâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
