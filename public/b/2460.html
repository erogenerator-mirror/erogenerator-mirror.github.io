I hope to serve you again, sweetie, we'll have lots of fun together"</p> <p>She was staring at my erect cock as she spoke. It only took a few seconds for it to explode in her hand but I have to say it was spectacular. There was a small stream of ejaculate and it went all over my chest and hand. Before I could recover from what just happened, I saw her take out her vibrator and put it away.</p> <p>"I'm going to use this to clean you up so you won't be so desperate to see and touch me again" she said as she got back and put the condom on. She smiled at me and then reached over and took one of my hands and led me to the bathroom.</p> <p>"I want to wash it clean. I've been craving it for so long I can hardly stand it anymore."</p> <p>She started in on my cock and I could only groan at her expert touch and lick her tongue as she ran her hands over my cock and then my belly.</p> <p>She took the lubricant and squeezed some into her hand and let it fall on my cock and balls. When she got back at my balls she lifted them up and gave them a squeeze and then rubbed her hand all over them. I nearly came at that point but she ignored me and continued to massage my balls as she slid the vibrator inside me.</p> <p>She was slowly making up for her earlier aggressions. She was stroking and massaging my cock with her one hand, sliding and turning it with the other until it was fully erect again. She started to work her hand up and down and up and down on me and my whole body began to shake as she worked me up and down. I could feel my balls starting to tingle as I approached my last orgasm.</p> <p>She kept pulling at my cock with one hand so I could get my legs farther apart. Then she started massaging my ass with one hand. It felt exquisite as she pressed her finger into my asshole. I felt like I couldn't get enough of it. I pulled my legs back even wider as she pushed her finger into me deeper. I knew I was going to blow again.</p> <p>"That feels so good, sweetie" I said as she pumped me as hard and as fast as she could. "I need to cum again, baby" she said just as my semen shot the first spurt into the water.</p> <p>She grabbed a towel and cleaned me up thoroughly before turning off the water and pulling me out of the bath. We dried off and then she picked up the towel and walked back to the living room as I grabbed her and kissed her as she opened the car door with my arms around her.</p> <p>"I love you, you don't know how happy you've made me." she said as she stroked my face and looked into my eyes.</p> <p>"You too," I replied kissing her passionately.</p> <p>"Now I think its your turnâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
