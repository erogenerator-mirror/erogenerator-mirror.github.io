This is an old friend just leaving. Not a boyfriend or anything, but a girlfriend. We didn't talk much at first, she thought she was alone and then he suggested we do this place for a while. She said I'd go nuts when she went home!"</p> <p>"Are you kidding me?" The blonde said, "She was pissed off, but she wanted to make sure I wasn't doing any of the things we just talked about when we kissed."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sure she was," I said. "She said a lot."</p> <p>"I see," the girl said. "Why can't she go home?"</p> <p>Well, since I was already there, I figured, my offer to go to work was too good to pass up. I was about to leave when my phone buzzed on the desk with incoming calls to the other women. I picked it up and went to pick up the other calls. When I got in my office, there were only about thirty people in there. I couldn't really be too bad at this job.</p> <p>I sat down at a desk which had a guy standing in front of me. He had his legs crossed. He had his hands on his knees. I noticed he looked at me as an example of how he was dealing with the work.</p> <p>When I asked him about the number of calls he turned to me. "What's up?" he said.</p> <p>"Why is another guy in there?"</p> <p>"Because he's the boss!" he said.</p> <p>"No, he wasn't. That's how he wants me to handle it. So, when the boss calls, that is," I said.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" the man asked.</p> <p>"Doing whatever it takes," I said.</p> <p>"But...but what if someone comes in and gets the boss into trouble?"</p> <p>"The reason I'm not telling you how it is is, I said. I told you he wants the boss to be a little tough for you. So, I said. I'll do whatever I've been asked to do, however long it takes. Do you get that, Mr. White?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess so," the man said with a big smile.</p> <p>"Can you do it?" I asked.</p> <p>"I can try," he said. "We just need a plan so we can find my boss. Let me explain," he said.</p> <p>"Please," he said, "just sign here for me."</p> <p>I went through his computer and printed out copies of his job description. The man did all the work. He had already come along and gotten the other women who were looking for work. He seemed to be in pretty good shape. I gave him a big smile to give to me, but the man smiled and kept on working. After the day passed, I sat down at the desk next to Ms. White, a big smile on his face.</p> <p>"So, I know we're going to have problems here," he said. "Now, what are you going to do about it?"</p> <p>"I'll be able to, if everything works out," I said. "What are you going to do about it?"</p> <p>"I'm going to put in a report for him, do some digging for him, and try to find out what he wants me to do," I said. "If he wants me to do anything to him, he should have sent me a letter. He should have told me what his problem is for me. But, he didn't. If anything happens to him, I'm sorry it happened. I really love him!"</p> <p>"Well, Mr. White, I think we're done with this. We're ready for another round and you'll know the difference, right?" I said.</p> <p>"Yeah," he said, "I think so. But...if anyone asks you, you should never answer that question. We're friends. We have a professional relationship."</p> <p>That would be me. I would never speak out of line. The old joke with the bosses was to 'speak if you think you're ready to speak.'"</p> <p>I stood up, got off the desk, and walked away. I turned as I did so to say, "Goodbye Mr. White, I'll never see you again. I love you."</p> <p>I walked to my car and drove away. I walked into work right after and asked for the boss. I gave him all the instructions for the next time and he smiled and told me he would be here. I waited until my next client called me all day. I waited with no real plans so I headed for the bank. I'd be thereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
