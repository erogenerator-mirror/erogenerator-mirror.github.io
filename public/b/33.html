They couldn't make out what it was but it grew bigger and more persistent until it suddenly seemed to grow from the carpet and was hanging above their heads, about 4 inches down from their noses. It felt like someone was sucking on and licking around its girth, licking it so fast that they couldn't see what was happening. It had a weird sort of smell like something that you would expect to find in a garden, like a strange insect crawling around in the soil...the smell of something to eat.</p> <p>It had grown, but never quite as big as before. A huge, black thing was hanging up on its arms, almost as wide as her wrist. The tip of its massive member hung near 10 inches above her head, resting between her breasts. Her heart pounded in her chest as the large tool, which was about 3 inches across, brushed her forehead and made her entire head spin. It was the scent of the creature that had been licking it. It was almost like a strange, musky fragrance. It smelled different, like rotting meat or something.</p> <p>"What the...what the..." she began to say. But the sounds of their captors stopped her from saying more. It just continued to hang there, hanging there, no more than 10 feet away.</p> <p>She was dumbstruck. This was too easy. There had to be no way this thing could possibly be any larger when it had grown 10 inches tall.</p> <p>"What the...what the...?" her repeated question.</p> <p>Nothing happened for a second.</p> <p>"Well, I've never been down this road before and I don't want to interrupt anything," she said nervously, not wanting to interrupt this strange, alien, beast in the middle of the compound, or any other time.</p> <p>"I think its just right, sweetheart," said another female voice.</p> <p>They had been in the courtyard for what seemed like several minutes. The whole building seemed like a maze, it contained all sorts of weird shaped doors and corridors with no windows. There was nothing at all to see but the buildings themselves.</p> <p>"This is crazy," she thought to herself.</p> <p>"This is what I've been waiting for since I was just looking for a girl," the voice said. "That's a special taste, just like...well...like an earthy desert."</p> <p>A big, round, metal door slid open.</p> <p>"What the hell is going on here," thought the female voice.</p> <p>Suddenly a huge, black thing burst through the opening and started to move towards them. The thing was massive too. This was ridiculous. It must have weighed an eyepan. Or maybe even more. It must have weighed over 300 pounds. It had to be 100 pounds heavy. Something was falling down over them to the ground.</p> <p>They began to shake.</p> <p>"What the hell is that thing up here," her captors chanted while pointing at it.</p> <p>"We call me...my husband," she answered, feeling their fear and uncertainty.</p> <p>"Well, don't panic, my dear sweet honey," said a voice behind her. It took her a second to realize it was her husband who was talking to her.</p> <p>"How have you been? How have you slept...what was it..." he paused, "You've been out here all day and we have not come anywhere close to finding anything to worry about," continued the voice.</p> <p>Her captors were starting to sweat. Her captors must have been working feverishly to free her. The fear was palpable even as her mind struggled to decide whether it was the sight of her husband being ravaged by some monstrous creature or the thought of her husband being forced to take her husband as his sex slave.</p> <p>"We're glad you're safe, honey," she heard the voice say, "But don't worry. You'll find no escape this time," said the voice in her husband's ear.</p> <p>"No, no," she pleaded. "You have to come and see me for yourself."</p> <p>The words made no sense to her. They just didn't do anything for her. Her husband was never going to go home and let her be used like this.</p> <p>"Look, honey," she said. "I understand the situation. After all, it's only been a bit over a week for you. You'll be just fine. We won't let anything happen to you now."</p> <p>Her husband smiled.</p> <p>"I'll be fine honey," he assured her. "After all, you will be right here with me for all these years," he thought smiling.</p> <p>She looked at him for a long moment.</p> <p>"I know, I knowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
