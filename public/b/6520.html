Her eyes roll back into her head from the sudden feeling of fullness, and he pulls out completely, leaving what can only be the head of his cock still inside her. Holding on to her hips, he leans over and kisses them both as the last of his cum is released. She has no idea how much cum is leaking out of his cock but it takes a moment.</p> <p>He smiles down at her as he pulls his cock out of her and she lets out a disappointed moan.</p> <p>"That was quick but worth it"</p> <p>He turns to his other side and leans her back so that all four are back on top of one another, his hands on her hips, and she is facing his ass, which is in perfect view for a moment. He leans over and pulls her lips in for a slow kiss first. "Don't go anywhere baby, let me fuck you."</p> <p>She moans as he takes advantage of her mouth, his kisses driving her insane with passion. She begins to run her hands up & down his back. He reaches around and takes her breasts in his hand, pulling on her nipples which caused his cock to harden as he does so.</p> <p>"Take me from behind"</p> <p>"I want you to do something for me baby so we can see"</p> <p>"Ok, but I'm really, really horny and wanted to wait until later," she moans in between kisses</p> <p>He turns around and sits her on the end of the bed and they slowly strip each other. She loves it when he touches her like this, knowing that he is only going to get that feeling of power once. She is looking up to him and he is staring back at her, not at anything but where his cock was when they were eating. She slides to the end of the bed and he grabs her thigh, helping her roll over so he is still on top of her. She loves his control over her. The way he pulls her hips with each hand makes her feel so secure and in control. They kiss again, her breasts still tingling as they are, and she feels her stomach start to get tight again.</p> <p>He puts his head between her legs, licking her slit and making her writhe. Her legs wrap around him, holding on to the edge of the bed so they will be closer together to touch. His tongue is hard as he continues to stroke her clit. Her nipples are standing out, red and very sensitive from the stimulation and he bites into her and they both moan. As far as she is concerned, she cannot resist this feeling and it makes her squirm more. He keeps licking her a little longer before his tongue dips down and begins to flick her clit, circling it as the base. His tongue pushes her over the edge and she screams out as she cums, his face covering the part of her body he wanted and needed to be in. This is just what he wanted. She finally reaches it and starts moving again, her pussy gripping him as her cum runs down their legs. He looks up at her and smiles.</p> <p>"I love you, I love you, I love you!" he says as she smiles.</p> <p>"I love you too... I can't believe I just had the best sex... oh fuck that feels so good." she says with a grin</p> <p>"Can I stay the evening?" he asks. It feels great to say that.</p> <p>"Oh yeah please," she whispers.</p> <p>"Be there in 30 minutes time"</p> <p>He kisses her and leans in for another kiss and she wraps her arms around his neck and holds him for a minute. As she relaxes back against him, he pulls the blindfold off and lets her fall into a kiss that almost seems like a long awaited kissâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
