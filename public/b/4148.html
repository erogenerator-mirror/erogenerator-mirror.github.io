I asked, and she looked down. "Are you okay?"</p> <p>"Yeah... yeah... you'll get it," she said, then she walked slowly over and slipped it on, looking over her shoulder at me. "What do you think?"</p> <p>Her t-shirt was just enough to keep me from looking down, but I think she could have made a point of it if she wanted too, so I pulled it on before she did. Once she was done, she stood there with it on for a second or two, then reached back over and did it again, and it looked even better than it looked from her front. Then I turned her around, and she looked up at me with those pretty, sad eyes but said nothing. I put my hands on her waist, and started the zipper down on her shorts down, and she smiled at me as I started to pull them off.</p> <p>Once I had them off, she stepped out of them and stood back up, and I pulled them down over her hips, leaving them on the floor. Then I ran my hands up, over her hips and around her ass. She felt so soft and warm in my arms, and I cupped them lightly in my hands, pressing them into her ass. I brought them up to her shoulder and let go, making her turn around.</p> <p>"Wow..." I said as she did. The whole time I was standing there, I was trying to think of something to say, or maybe to ask if there was anyway we could take that time to talk again. I really didn't have a lot of time in front of her right now anyway, so I didn't need a lot of time. "I like that shirt," I said.</p> <p>She looked down at herself, and I could see that she was in pretty good shape: she had long, black hair, but not much of it. When she pulled the little tank over her head now, it showed that, to be honest, if I hadn't gotten it off just to try it out a moment ago, it would have looked ridiculous.</p> <p>"Yeah," she said, still looking at me. "That's... nice. I think I can still get that on now." She grinned a little, and I laughed. "Don't worry about that shirt. I would do it again if you wanted."</p> <p>"Not if we're here," I replied with a nod. "I'd rather you wore it for a long time and we'll do it."</p> <p>"No," she said, smiling at me. "You do that. You do that a lot. It is a good shirt."</p> <p>"I'm glad you thought about that," I said softly. It seemed to her my heart was beating a little harder than it had been.</p> <p>She just smiled at me, and put her arms around my neck. Not saying anything like that, she just moved one hand down to my waist and back up, and my hands came up around her waist and around to her butt.</p> <p>"Oh God," I said. "That's gonna feel so good."</p> <p>It seemed to come naturally for her. I could feel her start to move slightly, and press into me as I pressed into her. That only made me more and more excited. That was probably a good thing.</p> <p>It took all the work I'd been paying attention to getting rid of my frustration with all the girls I had been going out with to get me the shirt off. Eventually, I was able to get it off. Once I went back to a sitting position with her, the two of us stood back and started to talk again.</p> <p>"You remember the first time you asked me about girls in the library?"</p> <p>"Yes?"</p> <p>"It was about halfway through my sophomore year, and I was walking around with my hands behind my head."</p> <p>"We?" "Yes."</p> <p>"So... I was talking to a math teacher and she asked me to go to the library during lunch and I was there in the middle of the night with her..."</p> <p>"And?" I asked. She was still smiling.</p> <p>"Well, we both had the same number of books I was going to study for," she said, pointing to where mine was. "Then I sat down when I'd finished that and the teacher came back to the desk and said to me: "Well, Mr. Davis, I think your girlfriend needs one last time to change before we go on."</p> <p>I smiled at her.</p> <p>"Can I show you to the front of the room?" she asked. That got me moving again. "You really shouldn't put it in the way of your study hall."</p> <p>I nodded and started to lead her out again, "I do that kind of..."</p> <p>"That's fine," she said.
