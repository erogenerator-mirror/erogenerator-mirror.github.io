"She thought I was my own mother and when I saw you, I said I was, too! I wanted to say something like 'Hello, mom' if you please, but didn't know what to do or say. Then she asked me 'Are you...are you...um...are you still...", she was looking at us both looking at you as she was saying.</p> <p>"Oh, mom," was the one word response. "I loved seeing you," was the first thing she said, which I'm sure would have been the next thing she would have said if she was trying to say 'I love you too,' which she would have done, even if I have been dead myself."</p> <p>We all sat down and she turned on her computer and started the game with the words, which she typed and asked us a series of questions which were to be a game and the next part of our session.</p> <p>At first I was thinking it couldn't possibly have been possible for mom to know what I had said because I did tell her to never ask me. I told her to never ask to hear anything from me again.</p> <p>"Oh Mom, I love you!" she said as if she was still shocked at my words. "I want to be with you!"</p> <p>"I love you too, darling," she was saying and then she asked to see my face again.</p> <p>"I...can't, mom," was my only response as I was hoping that she didn't know what I had said and was simply putting on her show of not asking.</p> <p>The game started and mom knew the game was going to start. When she called for a 'hit' she asked me, "Do you love me?" It was simple and sweet as all hell.</p> <p>"Yes," I said before I really thought about it. I would love mom even if she weren't your mom, but my cock was aching for release as soon as she said it.</p> <p>"Have you ever...", she had paused for a moment and I could see the edge of what she meant when she was being serious.</p> <p>"No, mom."</p> <p>"What?" she asked and then she added to me. "You haven't made love to me since the accident, have you?" Without waiting for an answer she continued. "Of course you have."</p> <p>"Yes, dear. It was wrong and I'm sorry but, yes. It was my fault. I wasn't even thinking about love. When you told me to do that I wanted to do it for you, you made me do it. Yes, I love you too."</p> <p>"Really?" I was sure of it. I'm sure I told mom so many things that night I wouldn't have been able to even think of anything else.</p> <p>"Yes, really, darling."</p> <p>I looked at the game and my cock was raging through my pants as I sat there thinking about what was to come. I loved and hated my mother. I think I was going to do something horrible, as long as the sexual pain in mom's soul, the pain in her heart and mind, the pain in her self esteem would keep her happy and I would see joy in her and that is the way I had always wanted to see her happy.</p> <p>"You're not mad at me, honey?" I had asked her as I sat there on the floor with my hand between them.</p> <p>"No, you just surprised me," she smiled at me in the same way that mom does when she is happy. We sat there for a long time.</p> <p>"Do you hate me?"</p> <p>"Only for you darling."</p> <p>"You're the best woman I know, mom."</p> <p>"You are, sweetie. Every man I've been with has told me that, although they did mention the sex sometimes, it didn't really matter to me because I still loved you." She was right. That made me want my cock in her again like nothing I had ever wanted before.</p> <p>"What do I say to you?" I asked her. "Why did you do it?"</p> <p>"I don't know, darling. I just did. You made me, I still love you. That was the most unbelievable, sweetest thing I've ever heard!"</p> <p>"Mom, mom," I was almost choking on the words. "We're friends, aren't we? We love each other."</p> <p>"We are, sweetheart!" she was smiling.</p> <p>"We've never even been on the same page. What happened to it? What happened to me?"</p> <p>"It happened to me tonight," she said as she leaned forward and kissed me on the lips.</p> <p>"No, you couldn't. You're my love, too, and all I have wanted is yourâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
