I'm not sure who looked first. Finally it opened again. I'm trying to tell who it was, I think, he said, and I look at it, and then a man comes into the door. His face is hard, I hear he's holding a gun. Then one of the first guys comes in. I'm not sure he's dressed exactly, or even what he is. My guess is he's wearing a suit. I'm not really sure he's a detective, I think one with a name and address is. And the man with the gun holds a glass of water. I can see his face clearly and I can't make him out. There are police cars around the corner of the house. I guess some one is going to be here by now. The police car is parked by the entry. At first, I can't tell whether or not he's there. They all walk up and there comes into a black car. It's the first one I ever heard of. I think my heart will leap out of my throat. But then the guy with the gun puts the glass down and the first one starts to shake his head in disbelief. His face gets bright red. "What the hell do you think you're going to do to us? Let us go right now."</p> <p>The guy with the gun puts his gun down and starts to get out of the car. I'm not sure if it's the police or the fucking drug dealer, but the second guy puts his shirt on and then starts walking towards me. But the first guy keeps talking and the second one puts his arms around me. And that's when I feel one of those little electric sparks that start to pulse and fly from his hand. Then this guy throws my arms down, I feel his hand on my ass. He's standing right up, one foot on each side of my legs. He starts to kiss my stomach. This guy starts rubbing his hands up and down my legs, I feel his hand on my cock. I've never been with a man before. I've tried many things and even gone down with one. What he does next really shocks me. He's sliding his fingers under the elastic of my little bikini bottoms and starting to lift them. I hear him tell the second guy to stop. Then I feel his fingers run up and down across my shaft. I've never had a girl touch my dick. Oh, he's going to make me cum! He starts playing with my nipple while I feel his other hand move up and down my chest and his hand pushes against my bikini bottom. Oh God, it feels good, but I'm about to go crazy for this guy. "Oh my God, you feel so fucking good, baby," I hear his voice say. I close my eyes and put my head down, and feel his fingers run back up my crack. I know I'm really close and he has to be getting his cock in my mouth or ass or anywhere with that fat black dick out, I can't believe this is really happening. He slips his fingers back down the crack and start to play with my hole, slowly pulling the hole until it looks like a large hole.</p> <p>He looks up at me, and my eyes are so big. "What are you waiting for, baby?" he asks. Then he pulls the last vest off and lays the shirt on the floor. I try to pull up and get his hands off my chest, but he's right there, his big hands are on my shoulders. Oh, damn, I can feel the hotness of his penis against the outside of my cheeks. Oh God. And then he spreads my cheeks and starts to push his cock in. I'm thinking that if I didn't have his hands under me, I couldn't let this giant black cock in my ass. And when I try to pull back, he pushes forward, harder, as far as he can. And I can't keep my hands off him. Even more than just the cock being shoved in my mouth, the feeling of my own hardness, it's overwhelming. With one hand he's holding my ass tight so his cock won't go any further, the other hand is on the small of my back, pulling me towards his hard cock. Oh, fuck, he's going to make me cum.</p> <p>The guy with the gun is looking over the top of some trees, "Hang on, bitch," he says, "let me see you. I want to do this for real." The man behind me looks up at the guy holding my dick and I feel his cockhead nudging the opening. I can't say no. Oh my God, he is finally going to really get the head in.</p> <p>Slowly, the pressure builds as his fat cock starts to slide in further. Oh God, he's starting to slide his cock in. Just the head. Oh Jesus, oh God, heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
