For several long seconds he looked at my eyes so intently that I was just too dizzy to react. Finally he pulled his hands away and I thought I would explode before I knew it and he was moving back a little. He was kissing me gently again and I was just staring at the ceiling with his arms around me and my head against his shoulder. I looked up into his face just as he started to unbutton his shirt. He leaned down and I could feel his warm breath on my neck and I sighed again, just for a little. He smiled at me and started to unbutton his shirt as he started to get naked. As much as I wanted to just take advantage of him the next thing I realized that I wasn't the only one enjoying myself. I saw him shrug his shoulders and he was naked as well... except the little white strip of cloth that his slacks had been tied through.</p> <p>I couldn't think what I felt because of my head and all I thought about was what his large naked chest looked like and his hands and arms. I realized that I was feeling something else too. Suddenly I gasped and felt my entire body go suddenly stiff and I felt the beginnings of an orgasm start to rise in me. I looked up into his face again and he was smiling again as he gently took both of my wrists and slowly pulled them through the loops in the front of his shirt. His hands seemed to be gentle and I felt his hardness press against my belly just as one heft of a boob caught my eye.</p> <p>"This could get interesting," I thought, "now is the time to ask what is more interesting." He was moving forward and sitting on my left lap. I wasn't sure how I wanted it so I just sat there trying to regain myself. I looked up into his eyes and knew he understood what I was thinking.</p> <p>"I think I'm still feeling something." Somehow I was able to say it again and he didn't notice so I was able to say it again. "I think I still need some more stimulation," I said as my own hands made the move to my crotch. I sat there still looking into his eyes knowing that somehow my feelings were about to be realized.</p> <p>He gave a soft laugh and continued. "I didn't realize I was in such a hurry, but you're right. I could still go for another one." He gave it one more little twist and he gave the tip of his penis another little caress and it sent me into another sort of dreamlike state of mind. I realized that his hands had started to move and he was sliding his hips gently against mine, letting our bodies grind into each other in a sensual embrace.</p> <p>When he got the rhythm set he turned me down. I was trying to get my legs open, but he was pulling them out and I was trying to get his hand up to my breast. He must have read my expression because he laughed again and said, "No I want this thing between my legs to come out, all alone. Maybe, just maybe, I'll go for something a bit more direct."</p> <p>"Okay, yes, you go with what. If you really don't mind." I agreed and turned around again. I felt an overwhelming desire to hold him close and I was a bit out of breath by the time he turned again. When he put his arms around me and lifted it I felt more relaxed. This feeling was almost exhilarating, and I felt almost as though we were one big person. His erection pressed against me as he said, "Now it's time to see just how much I might be able to squeeze into you."</p> <p>He lifted my t-shirt and I felt his warm fingers graze the sides of my breasts. I wanted to cover them with my hands so that I was able to press up against him and pull him closer to me. He lifted my arms back onto his shoulders and I felt his fingers sliding up and down my arms and around the back of my chest. Without taking his eyes off my breast he gently slipped one of his fingers through the zipper hole at the back of my pants and pressed it into my belly. I started to arch my back, trying to get more than just one touch of his fingers but he said, "Just do it or you're going to start getting a little nervous."</p> <p>"I'm pretty nervous. I guess it only hurts when you're a bit clumsy. If you want me to do the same thing you can turn around."</p> <p>"I don't need to do anything. My arms are up there to support me and that's all right. I've never had anything so big in my hands before and it's all you do to me. You're very gentle."
