He didn't try to turn back. He let her push him out of the apartment. Their first kiss. It was like that first time when he took her out. He didn't push past her lips on his mouth or pull into her soft skin on his own. Their hands and their bodies touched and then parted. His lips were soft and tender. He stroked her cheek while his body pressed against her. Her breath came out in a sigh. She wrapped her arms around him tightly and pulled him even closer. When they finally broke the kiss, she was breathing faster than he. He could tell she was getting nervous but his body was telling him she was trying hard to hide it. They hugged for a moment and then she stepped out of the apartment.</p> <p>She walked towards the living room. She reached up and kissed him gently on the mouth.</p> <p>"Thank you so much for being so sweet to me. And so sweet in bed. For being my brother.</p> <p>"Thank you, for being such a sweetheart. You are very handsome."</p> <p>She stepped back and smiled at him.</p> <p>"If you need me or your roommate for anything, just let me know . . . or call me or . . . or let me know," she responded.</p> <p>"Thanks . . . and you are . . . very sweet."</p> <p>"Glad to see you too," she replied. "I should . . . probably get my roommate to come back right away. Thanks for the kiss. You were really sweet, sweet," she winked.</p> <p>He didn't respond. He was surprised that she could see how he was feeling about her. But it was all his fault. His body took over and he couldn't resist. He took her hand and led her to the bedroom.</p> <p>"If you ever feel like taking a shower, just ask me," he replied.</p> <p>"No, that's ok. I would rather be naked with you," she smiled.</p> <p>"I will in a bit . . . right now, but maybe later we can do something about that. I'm looking forward to having a shower with you."</p> <p>That's when she heard the door close, so she turned around.</p> <p>"See you soon. In a bit, I will just have to wash up now," she replied with a smile as she walked out of the apartment.</p> <p>When she returned, he came over to her. He kissed her hand and then leaned down to kiss her once again.</p> <p>"I don't ever do other than kiss you," he smiled.</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Really. And you aren't going to take anything that you don't want to have. Just get in and we can do it all night long."</p> <p>"Will be happy to do it too," she responded. "Now get back," she said.</p> <p>"Are you okay?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes. I'm really okay with it now," she kissed him once more.</p> <p>She left his room and walked to where it was.</p> <p>"Would you mind getting dressed?" she asked.</p> <p>"What?" he responded.</p> <p>"Can you wear the clothes I laid out for you?" she asked.</p> <p>"You're getting dressed."</p> <p>"Yes. Please put on your clothes. I'll meet you in the bathroom."</p> <p>He stripped, not wanting to seem eager to stay naked for any length of time without being seen. It would make him appear more exposed from more of what this place had to offer. He walked into the bathroom, found the clothing already laid out for him by her roommate. He looked in the mirror and saw them in the shower as he put on the clothes he was laying out for her. He smiled, took them from the bathroom and turned on the shower.</p> <p>He got in the shower with the clothes that she laid out for him. The cold water felt good on his body. He looked down at his body. His ass was as perfect as any ass he'd ever seen. No man had a body that would make him look good. He took his dick in hand and started to stroke it. It felt so good feeling his cock up inside of him. But there was something even better about it. He was getting a hard-on because of that. He looked up at his body as it was being turned by the water.</p> <p>"I'm doing this for you. To show how much I care about not losing my top. That was my intention when I was stripping for you," she explained.</p> <p>"I think I'm going to like this," he said as he continued to stroke his cock.</p> <p>He turned and looked at her. She walked over towards him. She was looking directly into his eyes as she reached down and grabbed his cock. She pulled him upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
