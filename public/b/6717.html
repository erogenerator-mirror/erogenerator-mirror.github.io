I'll bring my car with me." I looked over at him, not really seeing him now except for the huge bulge in his pants, and smiled as he took my offered drink.</p> <p>"Sure. What do you need?" I asked, looking up into his face.</p> <p>"There's this guy you're talking to that said he's a real life lover," he laughed, "and they were wondering if he could get his cock into you? I think he should," he said, taking a sip of his wine before continuing. "They think you'll be hot too, but I hope so, because I'm dying to fuck you. I'd fuck you silly, but a cock isn't right."</p> <p>"I don't know what you know, stud," he chuckled, taking another sip of his drink, "but they say there's no difference."</p> <p>I laughed, "so what, I'll agree with you in a minute. What do you think about me being a little strange for a while?"</p> <p>"I'm a little surprised, but I know what you mean about making it happen. I have to wonder if I don't like having this guy, so I guess I'm going to have to play it safe for a bit." He grinned, "what did you think?"</p> <p>I chuckled, "it just turns out that he isn't exactly as good looking as you're letting me see."</p> <p>He shrugged, "but he's a guy."</p> <p>I nodded, "I didn't think so either, but you know what I'm talking about, don't you? Look at the way he looks at you. What sort of guy is that?"</p> <p>He stared into my eyes, trying to determine if I was teasing him with the thought of what was going to happen to me soon. I could see the answer in his eyes, and I didn't think it was a good fit. "He's nice, isn't he?" I asked him. My eyes never left his.</p> <p>I was already beginning to feel the beginnings of an uncomfortable feeling in my groin, and I was beginning to get worried. "I don't know what it is. I don't know if I can get it up, and there's a bulge in his pants, and you're so pretty and you know when someone's about to cum. You just don't seem to need me," I sighed.</p> <p>He took my cue and gave me a big smile, "I just had my hands full doing that to you, and I didn't think you needed me!" he laughed.</p> <p>"I just think it is kind of sexy!" I laughed.</p> <p>"What's that about?"</p> <p>"Well you see it in your eyes, there's something sexy in them and when you look at me and feel something there and it's just the way your body responds to me." I had to think of a way to get in his pants in the short time that he seemed to be having. I was starting to doubt that I could, and he could get away with it. "But that's not what I meant," I said, "It's what I meant when I said I had to make room for him, I don't know what that is right?"</p> <p>He smiled, "I know what that is. Don't you think you should try it with him, too?" he smiled.</p> <p>I shook my head, "but I thought that was just a way to end you being my lover."</p> <p>He laughed, "if that's what you want, that's why I'm trying to get you to go for it!"</p> <p>"Yeah, but I'm your lover, no one else needs to get their hands on me. You're not trying to get me to go for another man's cock, just some stranger," I laughed.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, it's just that I think if I play it safe," he laughed, "but I don't take risks!"</p> <p>"Don't you just know what I'm thinking?" I laughed.</p> <p>He put his glass down and looked up at me. "I'm hoping you take it up again."</p> <p>I laughed, "and maybe tomorrow night!"</p> <p>A smile crossed his face at me, and he reached out and grabbed my hand, "come on, let's go upstairs and have a nice long, hot bathâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
