As we continued to kiss, I pulled back slowly to give her a chance to cool off a bit, and when my eyes wandered she saw my expression.</p> <p>"It looks like it needs a bit of a cooling off. Come and lay here with me."</p> <p>I did as she asked. It was so warm in here! On the bed I just stretched out and took this chance to take some time to reflect on the way we had been together. The idea of doing it again here without any of this tension still seemed exciting to me even as I felt really horny.</p> <p>I didn't do anything really to try to convince her that there was any sexual tension at all. Instead I just went with our kissing as normal and let me just enjoy the feeling of our embrace as we lay there in her bed.</p> <p>We spent a lot of time just lying there enjoying the closeness of being together again. We continued to kiss, but I felt the intensity of things increasing as the evening wore on.</p> <p>We kissed for a while, and her hand moved over me and began to gently rub me. This made me tingly as she started to tickle my shoulders. I started to rub my breasts with my arms. To ease her a bit on my back we rolled over and lay in each other arms. We began to lie in each other's arms and kiss again, a little more gently.</p> <p>"I can't tell you how much I've been looking forward to this for a long time now," she whispered, "but let's say tonight is the night with me, you and me together."</p> <p>She reached down and gently began to run her fingers over my breasts under my shirt. And I let her.</p> <p>"This is going to be special," she said. "You're going to enjoy this."</p> <p>She pulled my shirt up and off and lay herself down on her back. I lay alongside her on my side, still running my fingers up and down my body with my eyes closed enjoying the sensations and the warmth and softness. She reached out and gently ran her hand over my breast again.</p> <p>She smiled at me, "So far, so good, but you do seem to like that."</p> <p>I turned my head and took her hand and put it on my breast. We both groaned a little at this.</p> <p>"Do you really like playing with my softness?" she asked. "Do you like me with it?"</p> <p>"Yes," I answered. "I wish it was mine."</p> <p>She moved her hand down over me and found my cock. It was hard and I could only tell that she was moving her fingers over my cock which made it grow in response to her touch. She moved over and took it into her mouth as I did her. I found the taste strange, but the sensation of her tongue rolling along the sides of my shaft almost seemed strange somehow, and she seemed to sense that I liked it. She stroked and massaged me with her hand as I continued to suck the end off her fingers as her own hand continued to do its magic to my cock.</p> <p>I felt as if she were going to put a finger in me to do the magic there, but she stopped. My whole body seemed to respond to her sucking I felt even more intensely at her hand on my shaft. Her fingers explored my cock and balls, but she also stroked my belly and breasts as she enjoyed the sensations.</p> <p>Finally she stopped and lay there, watching the pleasure she was bringing to me. I could feel my own body responding to her touch. I could feel the excitement which had just been building up in me.</p> <p>"You are so sexy," she whispered, "I love what you do to me."</p> <p>She raised herself up and lay on her back, her legs wide apart and her hands holding herself open.</p> <p>"Come and join me," she said. "It's time I show you how much I love being with you, for the first time in a long time."</p> <p>I could feel my breathing rate quicken under her touch and I moved forward and moved myself down onto the bed beside her until my lips met hers. There was a soft wetness of our mouths and two tongues touching. Her hand moved slowly down my body and I started to feel her finger on my nipples. I felt her touch them which made me sigh.</p> <p>Then she broke the kiss. I could feel her legs spread and her fingers running along my body to my cock which she kept stroking softly in response to my feelings. I could feel her legs and hands moving up and down along my legs, sliding and caressing the soft skin with her fingertips.</p> <p>"Do you like this?" she asked. "Do you like knowing that I'm touching you and feelingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
