Even if she wasn't exactly comfortable with him, it probably made her uncomfortable, he thought. And the very thought of sitting here and talking to him made her insides rut and itch. After he told her what he did to her, he was going to want her to do the same. And even though she said "no", she would never be a "real "real" girl.</p> <p>He walked closer to her until his body was inches from her own. His warm breath on her face made her shiver and a shiver of desire coursed through her. That feeling of anticipation excited and thrilled her. And once his hand reached down to her knee, she closed her eyes and felt him moving closer.</p> <p>The feel of his heat against her skin sent a wave of lustful sensation into her center. It was as though she were feeling all at once. It was as if she was standing there in the middle of a desert, waiting to be released, as if she was walking in circles around a big, warm man. When she finally opened her eyes to gaze at him, he was standing there, looking so good in his jeans. His body was perfect. It was hard to believe he hadn't taken care of himself in so long or had it really been that long?</p> <p>She wanted to lie down right there and just run right into the bed. She wanted to grab him right then and there and run her hands up and down his thighs, then around to his sweet package, and suck his balls. But she had to be careful – she wouldn't be allowed to touch him without breaking contact with his mouth. She kept her eyes locked with his face as she slowly slid her hand from his thigh up and around to his chest. Then, she began to kiss up his neck, and down the side of his chin. Then, she trailed her hands up his neck to his cheek and he moved over until she could feel his warm breath on her ear. She shuddered. A moan broke out in her throat as she ran her hands though his hair.</p> <p>He tilted his head up and softly nibbled on her ear. "I'll go first." He gently slid his hands up her body, over her shoulders to her arms, and began to caress her soft smooth skin. She could feel herself shiver. After a few more minutes, his hot breath on the side of her neck, he let her arms go.</p> <p>"Oh, no," He said gently, sitting up between her knees. "Just follow me." He moved to kneel between her thighs.</p> <p>As his fingers moved over her, she could feel her own wetness pooling between her legs. He leaned in and slipped his tongue inside her. He tasted her sweetness and felt his cock twitch against her thigh. As he pulled her wetness out of her, his tongue danced around her lips and across her clit. She gasped and groaned in pleasure. He could feel her body trembling.</p> <p>He pulled out his tongue again and slowly ran his fingertip across her anus. "Are you relaxed?" He asked.</p> <p>"Mm hmmm," she responded. "I can feel that, Sir."</p> <p>"Good," he murmured, "Very good." His finger slid into her ass easily.</p> <p>"Oh." She responded, "Thank You." He leaned down and kissed her once more, their tongues twining as they embraced.</p> <p>After a minute of his finger in her ass, he began to move his tongue in circles and rub it firmly against her clit. She was so wet he could feel the friction of his body against her own. He slipped a second finger inside her, causing his cock to jerk against her. "You like that?"</p> <p>"Mm hmm," she breathed.</p> <p>He slid his fingers inside her again. Her anus clenched around his fingers, but he wasn't going to stop now. He slid them both in and out, twisting them back and forth. Then he moved around her clit and started to flick it with his tongue.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, Sir. That feels real good." He kept his fingers hooked inside her with the tips. She moaned as he gently flicked her pussy.</p> <p>He moved his tongue up to her clit again and started to flick it with harder and deeper circles. She began to tremble and squirm. "Sir, may I come?"</p> <p>"Yes." His tongue moved around her clit a bit faster.</p> <p>"Oh, yessssssss." She let her thighs spread wide and her pussy contract over his fingers as she felt a wave of pleasure run through her. The contractions tightened her up. When she felt him move her clit, she gasped.</p> <p>"Oh, Sir. I'm coming—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
