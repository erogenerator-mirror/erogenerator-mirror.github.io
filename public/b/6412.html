His eyes flicked quickly over to his mother, wondering what she was thinking and then back to her. As all eyes turned to him again, he could see a flush begin. She'd noticed.</p> <p>He smiled slightly. "My Mom had been so worried," he said. "Maybe she forgot. She was worried that she had really hurt you."</p> <p>Sara's eyes shot up to his. "I... really... did. She'd been worried so much."</p> <p>His mother nodded. "I'm sorry, my son," she said. "Did Mom really hurt that much?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>Sara's eyes settled quickly on her mother, her hand sliding over her mother's. "Mom, I'm so sorry for what she did."</p> <p>The woman lifted her hand. "It's okay." Her hand rested on her mother's. "I didn't expect it, I did."</p> <p>Sara glanced across at her husband, who was still sitting there, smiling and looking at the couple.</p> <p>He glanced over at him too, not wanting to give away what she was thinking.</p> <p>The woman turned his mother just as he was turning away. "Can I ask you something, Dad?" she asked, looking up at him. "Do you feel bad after what she did to you?"</p> <p>"Yes," he answered, smiling. "I would rather let it be."</p> <p>His mother nodded. "I understand. It was hard... when we were in my teens," she said with a small laugh. "I'd rather give it up for someone."</p> <p>"I'll keep that in mind," Mr. Jackson laughed. "Is it true that you... did you make love to your daughter when you were younger?"</p> <p>Sara and Sara both nodded in confirmation, wondering what might be said.</p> <p>Sara's mother reached out and held her hand, letting it fall gently and then slowly back, a soft smile growing on her face. "Well, that's good," she said, nodding to his wife, who was looking back at them again.</p> <p>Sara's mother shook her head. "It's nothing. We're pretty much always together, Dad. We're just always home."</p> <p>"Yes, we're always together, Mom," he said. "But just for this..."</p> <p>He reached out to Sara, pulling her to him as they stood and as he took his mother, holding her tightly against him. He turned her to his ear and whispered, "Have you ever made love to your son?"</p> <p>"Mmm, yes once. It was different," she answered, turning to glance at her husband again. His eyes were closed, a smile on his lips, and his smile slowly disappeared a little. "It's not your fault, sir."</p> <p>Sara felt herself begin to blush as he looked at her, his hand still holding hers. He leaned his head down and kissed her gently, moving his lips over hers with a soft touch at first and then more assertively, pressing their lips together as if he was trying to get an inch or two of his tongue in her mouth. She moved back against her son, pushing back slowly, as if to try and get a little more of his tongue in her mouth, but he had her as firmly as a woman could be pushed back.</p> <p>He kissed her harder than he has ever kissed anyone before. It wasn't the first time his lips had touched his mother, only the first time anyone's had touched or felt her. But this was still something that could never happen between father and son, and it sure as hell wasn't going to be tonight. He held onto his mother all the same, as if it was a duty to her that she wanted to protect or to show her love.</p> <p>Finally his lips retreated and his eyes met her again as he put his lips to his mother's ear again. "Is this... is it incest?" he whispered. "It's incest with your mother?"</p> <p>Sara felt herself blush, her eyes misting up slightly. "It's... it's very... not... it's... incest with a woman..." Her voice trailed off as her heart dropped when she heard all of the words, all of the things that she'd been thinking.</p> <p>He looked up at her and smiled. "I'll explain it to you," he laughed softly. "But if that's what you really want, then let's take a chance, okay?"</p> <p>Sara gave him a small nod. "Okay," she agreed, leaning up on her elbow and looking toward the road. "I love you, Dad." She leaned against him. "Just... for what we're doing."</p> <p>"It's only just starting," he said with a smile.</p> <p>Sara nodded, trying to control the impulse toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
