I’ll get the rest of the weekend off. Are you gonna come over here and fuck me there in the hot tub?"</p> <p>“Yes, I’ll be there with your cock in my mouth.”</p> <p>She giggled and I laughed. He put his arm around her and pulled her to him, kissing her neck, pulling her tits out of the water with her hands, her nipples hard against the white fabric, and she held her tits tightly in her hands. He pulled down the bottom of her suit, and as she stepped out of it, the two of them were naked, the water cascading down on them, his cock thick and hard against the bottom of her pussy as he held her, her hand between them reaching down between them to pull it.</p> <p>He kissed her neck, her lips, while he rubbed the head of his cock against the opening to her cunt.</p> <p>"Mmm, that feels so good, honey," she said. "This is so wrong, it’s not really supposed to be going at all."</p> <p>"I know, and neither is this.”</p> <p>He held her a few more moments, then pulled away.</p> <p>"I know, honey. I just want us to do it in the tub again."</p> <p>“Okay, hon, if you don’t like it, we’ll put it back on and go outside and do it."</p> <p>He kissed her and stepped out of the water. They walked up the pool deck into the hot tub and, sitting beside each other, they began to kiss. He held her and felt her naked breast in his hand as he kissed her.</p> <p>The kissing grew more and more urgent as she felt his cock beginning to grow against her. She reached behind to undo his pants, and then she pulled it out and over the top of his cock, feeling it growing. He unbuttoned the top button again, reached below to pull her suit off. She stepped out of her pants right there on the water deck, her skirt falling at her hips while he pulled the bottoms to her feet while he turned her around to kiss her and get the suit off her.</p> <p>He stepped back, and then picked her up and carried her into the hot tub, sitting down beside her with a smile.</p> <p>“Mmm, those felt good on me when you slipped out of those wet suits like that. I’m so horny looking at you.”</p> <p>They kissed again while he stood and began to undress. She slid her arms around him, wrapping her legs around his hips, his hardness pressing against her, his hands lifting her leg so they could join the kiss as her skirt dropped to the deck. He stood up and took her hand and they headed into the hot tub, kissing and caressing each other as he sat back down. They moved together to sit on the seat facing each other, and he put his arm around her, pulling her into him, kissing her, rubbing himself against her and feeling her getting hard as he kissed her. He moved his hand inside her and felt her begin to leak again, feeling her nipples growing. He moved his hand to her belly, feeling her belly, sliding it lower, rubbing her skin there.</p> <p>She reached down between their bodies, to rub herself against his hardness as he stroked his fingers over her clit. He could feel the liquid coming out and he moved his hand back, pressing it directly into her ass and then into her so that his fingers were up to his knuckles in her ass, and his middle finger in her cunt.</p> <p>She felt the warm air and he lifted his head, kissing her as she rubbed herself against him.</p> <p>“Would you fuck me, honey?” She asked him.</p> <p>“I would love that, but we’ll go to a motel and I will.”</p> <p>We sat there for a minute, and he broke from the kissing.</p> <p>"Would that be so bad, honey?”</p> <p>“Yes,” she said, and then giggled. “If that is okay with you, hon.”</p> <p>“I guess.”</p> <p>“It’s okay with me, anyway.”</p> <p>She moved up onto her knees, reaching down for his cock. She wrapped her hand around it, and then she leaned back to look at him. Her eyes were shining.</p> <p>“I’m a virgin, baby.”</p> <p>“Really?”—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
