I have been here all fucking day and the only thing that was keeping me alive was not to just die," she said, looking at the girl's eyes.</p> <p>"That's too bad. I know what it's like. I didn't want to let you lose that feeling you have with us. I didn't want to be able to look back on this with a happy mind," she said softly, reaching out to gently touch my face.</p> <p>"I know, I just wanted some alone time to think. I guess I kind of forgot about you and that was an added bonus," she said as she reached out for me, her eyes going back to the girl's eyes.</p> <p>"I don't have anything left, I have more of the house to do," I responded as we continued our walk to the main house.</p> <p>We walked toward our own house which was in the middle of the woods about fifty yards away from the woods and had a great view of the state's western mountains.</p> <p>"I do love your house," I said and her eyes went wide at that.</p> <p>"I know, I have a feeling that if I had stayed here and we had lived here all this time and had lived together, you wouldn't be alone right now," she said, taking the handle of her leash from me and leading us toward the door as if she wasn't there already.</p> <p>She unlocked the door into the house just as I opened it to let in our purchases.</p> <p>"We don't get a lot of sleep," I said as we entered from our bags.</p> <p>"You sure? We were hoping you would wake up and be alone," she said sitting down on the couch.</p> <p>She didn't even bother to get her purse or keys, she just got up and headed towards the door.</p> <p>"I am off to bed... just thinking," she said as she reached out with the leash.</p> <p>"Oh I can get the bed ready in about ten minutes. I will be waiting for you," she answered, taking the collar off and slipping it onto my shirt as she walked by me towards the bedroom.</p> <p>~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p> <p>As we headed towards the bedroom, I looked around to make sure it was clean and that I had the place to myself.</p> <p>"Don't be afraid," she said pulling me close to her. "Now, are you ready?"</p> <p>"Yes," I replied as I felt her hand slide up my shirt to my stomach. She undid my belt and dropped my jeans to the ground. I felt her breasts press against me, her hands running up my thighs to cup and pull my cock.</p> <p>"Oh yes. Now I want it in me," she said softly, as she turned me over and guided me inside her. I gasped as I felt her pussy slide down onto me, sliding over me as I filled her.</p> <p>"I'm so scared," I said, as my first few inches sank into her.</p> <p>"I know," she whispered before kissing me as she began to slide up my cock.</p> <p>"I'm such an idiot," I said.</p> <p>"I know. I mean the only way to tell is that I love you. I'm not sure we can do everything and even stop this if you wanted and you want." "It's not easy being scared. I love you for that," I said as I held her breasts, still hanging down as her hips moved.</p> <p>"That is because, I love you more than anything. I know that but I love it, we do everything together," she said as it hit me that she loved me more. "I really think, if you had just started to make love to me, I would have married you," she continued, her hips moving at a quicker pace.</p> <p>"I don't know...," I began to say, as she kissed me hard.</p> <p>"I know... I love you too," she said with a smile.</p> <p>"I love that too," I responded.</p> <p>"We are going to have to try different positions... but right now, lets rest, I need to get this big cock inside me," she said as she reached down to stroke me.</p> <p>I was standing at the foot of the bed as I watched her lean over to grab the bottle of oil, I guess we were going to use the same technique as to oil up my cock. She reached over to me and opened the bottle of oil, pouring some down my shaft to the head, before guiding it to her pussy. I watched as she spread some around and slid my cock inside her.</p> <p>"Oh yeah," I responded, as I watched her lips slide down as she slid up and down, taking my full length inside her.</p> <p>"Oh shit. I love howâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
