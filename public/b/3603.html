I said. "Are you on the pill?"</p> <p>"I can't do it here," she said. "You might get a hangover."</p> <p>"You'll have to put something on in my room to help out," I said.</p> <p>"I'm not getting you anything else," she said. "I'll get you anything else."</p> <p>I took her keys and walked her back to her place, the keys still in her hand. On the way out she turned to face me. She looked me square in the eye and said quietly, "I'm not giving you anything. Not yet. Just stay here."</p> <p>I hesitated, and she grabbed me by the hand and led me back to her room. When we got there, she sat on the edge of a bed and looked at me, "I'm sorry about what happened, I know you enjoyed it, but we can't let it happen again," she whispered. "We'll just have to let it happen."</p> <p>I just stood there in embarrassment, and she took my hand and led me to her bed.</p> <p>The next morning I woke up to a soft, pleasant sound. She was lying in the middle of the bed, her head on the pillow and a hand on my thigh. I turned my head to kiss her neck lightly.</p> <p>"I love you," she said before falling asleep.</p> <p>After awhile, I got up and went into her room. I felt guilty about what my mom had put me through. I was tempted to simply ask for a piece of my mother, but decided not to. She was so beautiful the evening was over. I walked around her room, and she had a little teddy on, just the one piece, with a small pair of pajama bottoms with petticoats hanging from a knot on the far end. I could see the thin strip of red fur just above her slit. One night they were not as sexy as I thought they would be, but at least they didn't belong there, and they covered her entire mound, just a little above the opening of her pussy.</p> <p>When I climbed over the end of the bed she was still asleep on the edge. I slid in beside her, but she took my hand and raised it up, "Don't look when I sleep," she whispered. "I'm here."</p> <p>As I turned back to her, she took my hand and put it back on her mound.</p> <p>"Are you awake?" she whispered, and I nodded. "Good, because when I'm you, I can be very, very quiet, can't I? This is a part of me you still have not seen," she said with a smile. "My favorite things are the ones you've never seen before."</p> <p>"Oh, yes," I said. "And my favorite is you."</p> <p>"No," she said, again with a grin. "I want you."</p> <p>"Yes you do," I said, my erection almost at full mast as I looked at the beautiful woman between my daughter's legs.</p> <p>I lay on top of her on my back, our combined weight pressing us together. "Can I?" she asked, her eyes looking at my throbbing cock.</p> <p>"No," I answered, sliding down her body until her head was barely touching the sheet. "I don't want this," she said.</p> <p>I looked at my cock, "I want you," she said.</p> <p>I raised myself up until I was lying underneath her and she wrapped her arms around me, her face just inches from my cock. I put my hands on each side of her butt, and she took the hint. I lifted the petticoats and they fell down a little higher, and then her slit was touching the tip of my shaft. I slid a little further down and she wrapped her legs around me and held me there.</p> <p>I lay on top of her, feeling how hot and wet she was and the hard nipples digging into my chest. We both started moving our hips. We kissed, and I put my face up next to hers, and we kissed some more. I slid my cock into her pussy, and my eyes opened wide when the walls of her vagina closed around me and began to massage me.</p> <p>I moved my face down to her shoulder and nuzzled her there. I slid my tongue into her ear and kissed her there, slowly. She was breathing hard. Slowly. She had her eyes closed, and her movements on my cock were steady little movements. Our tongues were touching everywhere. It was exciting. Very scary. She held me tight. The softness of a woman could be a lot of fun, especially after having a lover. She began to move, and I lifted my hips, letting her go with me. Our rhythm was just as good, and as good as ever. I felt my climax approaching.
