We'll get them if we find them. Do we have a deal?" The two women had been speaking to each other for several minutes.</p> <p>"I don't want to think about it if you don't understand, but I've always had this fantasy of making love with six men at the same time....." "Oh, is there more...how many men?"</p> <p>"You really think it would work, don't you? We just don't need to make it sound too realistic." The men looked over at the others and smiled at her.</p> <p>"Well, you were right, isn't that what it sounded like? We've never done it...." They nodded enthusiastically. This time it was different. "But that must have sounded exciting to you...."</p> <p>"Oh yes, it was exciting......." she said and she moved to the back of the table to lean against it. She unbuttoned and unzipped her skirt, letting it drop to the floor. Then she kicked it onto the couch next to the chair. The other men were now sitting on the other side.</p> <p>"I think I'll try it," she thought.</p> <p>She sat down next to him on the couch, and leaned against him. He put his hand on her knee up above her thighs and slid his fingers upward in the small of her thigh. They were both breathing heavily. She pulled her skirt all the way up over her head and moved her hands away from them, then pushed his finger up into his mouth.</p> <p>He sucked on her finger and then moved it away from her body. He then slipped his fingers around her hip to her pussy, where he pushed his finger inward, slowly. He did this several times, and she almost fainted as his finger went in and out, sliding in and out in slow, teasing circles.</p> <p>"It won't feel that good......." She leaned against him, trying not to fall over.</p> <p>"We'll find out, I think. It's going to be a long and wonderful night....." He laughed and put his hand on her thigh. "Let's just enjoy the moment, because I'm sure it won't be long."</p> <p>The last question to ask was, "Is it really the whole thing, or just in the beginning."</p> <p>"It'll be a surprise....," she thought.</p> <p>She leaned back against the sofa, just watching as he pulled his hand away and stepped back a little. She reached and started to unbutton his shirt and pull it off. She reached for the belt on his pants and pulled them down. His cock sprang loose, making her moan. With a look of wonder, she reached down and gave it a little squeeze. He closed his eyes and sighed.</p> <p>She stood up, and went to him. She kissed him softly on the lips and stepped back slightly. He got to his knees and sat down next to her. He took her hand and started to kiss the inside of her elbow. His kiss, soft and caring, was driving her crazy with desire.</p> <p>"You shouldn't be kissing my hand......"</p> <p>"Does it bother you?"</p> <p>"It doesn't......?"</p> <p>"No, it doesn't."</p> <p>"But it does....." He put her hand on his cock. His hand closed over her wrist, pulling her hand back to hold it there. He kissed it and licked the tip of it, then pulled back. He kissed his way back down her neck, ending at the collar of her shirt. He looked up for a second, not able to believe this might be happening.</p> <p>She pushed him off her. "Let's go back to the table." He stood up, his cock still hard as a board. She turned to the waiter, and they walked back to the table. She sat on the chair and he put a chair in front of it. They both sat down in the chairs and took their glasses of wine, sipping.</p> <p>"You're beautiful in these clothes," he said as she looked up at him. She blushed.</p> <p>"Thank you.......I'm not used to compliments."</p> <p>"No, I'm very flattered." He reached down to feel her breast, taking his time as he did so. Her nipples were already poking out at him. He slowly moved one hand down to the back of her thigh, pressing gently against it. He could feel her tense up and he moved his hand to cup her pussy. She moaned again. "God, you're wet," he said. He ran his finger up and down her slit.</p> <p>"Oh, good," she said, holding him to her.</p> <p>He reached between them to cup her mound. He lifted from the table and put his penis head at the opening of her pussyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
