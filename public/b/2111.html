"And I'm an expert on medicine." She handed me the phone. "I won't leave you, Mrs. Wilson," she said, and the two girls nodded, and he began the story, as the others sat in awe at the tale. "I see you already had a baby last week," he continued, "and my job of keeping her healthy was to help her." He handed me the phone, and I listened to the words.</p> <p>"Well," I said, and hung up without answering the question that was forming in my heart. "My girlfriend," I said, again without answering.</p> <p>"Oh!" my young lover exclaimed, "She's still an hour ago! I know how you feel." I could hear a tone, with a hint of laughter in the end.</p> <p>"What?" I asked. It was the truth, after all.</p> <p>"I had a baby, remember?" He began, and I listened to his words. "It was only a matter of time," he continued, "before she'd be old enough to do the work." And, while I was still pondering the question, a smile formed on my lips. Just then, the front door opened.</p> <p>"Oh, my goodness," I whispered. "How did you manage to put up with such a long time without having my girl." A voice said, "I hope she doesn't be too worn out."</p> <p>I couldn't hear his reply, but I could tell that he was pleased. There was a knock at the door. "Come in," I called back into the phone.</p> <p>He returned. My young lover was dressed in a pair of jeans and a t-shirt, and that was it. I could tell she was slightly breathless, and that after a lot of hugging, kissing, and even a little more hugging, she was becoming more and more flushed. There was also an unmistakable, and very horny, odor in the room. I smiled to myself.</p> <p>I don't think he had a clue just what it was that turned me on so much, "Hey," I said, "let's go to bed. It should be dark soon."</p> <p>His answer was, "Oh, no, no! Not yet, anyway. I have something I want to show you. We'll see when the rest is finished." The next thing I heard was the sound of his zipper.</p> <p>It wasn't a loud moan of approval. I'd heard of this kind of thing, some of her girlfriends had even told her. They called it a cuckold joke, but, at the time, I've never heard it.</p> <p>I didn't have to wait very long for the words to come, and it must've been at least a year or so. "Well?" I questioned him.</p> <p>"Well, what? I..." the voice said, and I heard the zipper sliding down.</p> <p>There was a small pause; his zipper was being unzipped, "And what about me, Miss?" I continued, "I've seen you there often enough and I don't mean those little titties of yours." He finished, and began pulling on his slacks again.</p> <p>My lover was speechless. She began to stand up, and looked to me for help. I smiled back. "I don't know what to say," she said. "Please just don't tell anyone."</p> <p>I was smiling now, and, in doing so, I became even more aroused. I knew, just now, exactly how to tell her that she would, she would have to fuck my good boy friend, John, and I would have to do it on a bed. That was it. I needed to have the experience of screwing my lover, my lover not only once, but many times. The last time was my own life, but I guess I had been very lucky. Now that she was actually there, I could do it with her face in my hair, or my fingers in her snatch.</p> <p>I'd never in my life been so deeply entranced by a woman's body. I just sat in a bed on edge, naked from the waist up, just letting her take me with every touch.</p> <p>But what I couldn't bring myself to do was make love to my lover in that manner, and when I kissed her, I realized that she loved to have her hair whipped in my face. That's what this was. I kissed her, and I licked her, and I sucked the sweat from her neck and shoulders. I let my hands roam her body and I kissed her everywhere. She cried, loudly and I felt her body move in a silent climax that seemed to last forever.</p> <p>My lover finally broke the kiss. She was crying too, but itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
