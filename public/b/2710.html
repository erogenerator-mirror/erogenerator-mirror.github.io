My hands began stroking his hard cock.</p> <p>"I'll just have to make you more comfortable" he said.</p> <p>I got up and took his hand and brought him to the bedroom. He got on the bed and we began kissing again. He pulled me to him and had me on my back. He kissed the side of my neck first and then my earlobe. He put his mouth to my ear and very gently licked it.</p> <p>I could feel how excited he was just by hearing me.</p> <p>I had never thought about it but there was no telling how far I would go and I never thought about that in real life. Now that I was on the bed with no idea, there was no doubt I wanted to see what would happen.</p> <p>I started to feel him moving over me. He was going to get onto the bed on his back and he began spreading his legs. Then when I had opened a bed blanket and was standing above him I realized I was holding my breath.</p> <p>He was taking his eyes off me. I looked down at his cock and what seemed like a thousand little drops of cum were still slowly forming. He had taken his right hand and was gently rubbing my pussy. He stopped moving and said "let's not stop this time" then he lowered my hand and began gently kissing his stomach down to my bush.</p> <p>"Did you want me to make you cum?" he asked.</p> <p>"No! Not at all" I said. "I want you to make me cum" he said. I lay back and opened my legs. He started to move over me and I could feel his fingers getting wetter and wetter.</p> <p>He moved a part way down my body. I could feel his kisses.</p> <p>He kept kissing me. I felt like he was making love to me. It felt like he was being kissed over and over again and it was electric, and it made me feel all the way up to my nipples.</p> <p>He started to trace them with his tongue. His first contact made me shiver. He went lower and his warm tongue was very wet and very soft. He moved his left palm down and began to rub my clit. He began to kiss the inside of my thighs.</p> <p>"I just want to make you cum" he said in between his little sucking sounds.</p> <p>"This is so wrong, I'm not ready for that to happen" I said.</p> <p>"What will happen if I don't make you make you orgasm?" he replied.</p> <p>"Please," I begged.</p> <p>"Do you want to cum?" he asked.</p> <p>"No!" I quickly said.</p> <p>"I want you to cum so you can cum with me" he said.</p> <p>"Oh, my God, I don't know" I said.</p> <p>"I want you to, and you will. " he said with that big smile on his face. I was totally excited by what was happening to me, what he just said.</p> <p>"I want you to be a part of this" he said. His fingertips now were rubbing my clit. He said something about "making me cum" and moved to sit between my spread thighs. I was already so excited. I lifted my thighs and parted and I was feeling more open in a minute.</p> <p>"I want you to eat me" I said. I moved closer to him, put my pussy up to his mouth. He began sucking my clit then back to my wet love nub, which felt incredible, but my nipples got harder asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
