I can't believe how lucky I am that you were so good to me. And, I can't believe you've got the confidence and stamina of someone who's used to taking from afar that's so far behind you?"</p> <p>She took my silence as a good sign, and without waiting for me to respond with a full one, she reached down and unzipped my shorts, then gently dragged it off of me, and dropped it beside me. I'd only taken a glimpse of her panties before, but before I'd put them on, she knelt down before me.</p> <p>"That's such a nice cock! So hard, so hot for my little married cunt!" she said lustily.</p> <p>"So am I!" I replied without saying a word.</p> <p>That was it. That was the moment, the moment where we were both going to consummate our lifelong moment of lesbian sex. We both knew it, with or without the approval of our partners. Somehow, we'd have to be the first to carry out the event. For some reason, I couldn't tell, she was going to make me cum too, and so she pulled my boxers up and off quickly and then went back for it.</p> <p>She did it again, but slower this time, and looked up at me and smiled as she pulled my cock to her lips. She sucked me, and as she did, she licked her wet lips, and looked up at me and said, "Well? Wanna do it all over again?" She smiled and then looked back down at me and winked. "Come on, stud. Do it!"</p> <p>Not surprisingly, I looked as though I was in a quandary. I looked up at her with pleading eyes. "What?" I finally asked her.</p> <p>"You know, I'll have to do it twice. And I'll have to cum once, and then we can go back to my place and cuddle and go to bed when we wake up." Oh, that sweet lady.</p> <p>"But, if I cum like you've been doing, there's no way I can stop!" I protested. "We've been with women."</p> <p>"No, we're married!" she said emphatically, "And it's been so long since your cock has been inside a pussy. And, I wouldn't want to risk losing it with a cum."</p> <p>Well, I certainly wasn't going to give up a night of great sex with a girl until I had what I wanted, right? Well, it was a night. And anyway, if it wasn't going to involve cunnilingus, what was it going to involve?</p> <p>"Are you OK with this?" I asked her.</p> <p>"I'm fine with it," she smiled, "And if I cum, so be it. But I'd rather have someone to cuddle me with this time."</p> <p>"OK," I said again.</p> <p>"Cuddling and stroking me like we used to do, before." She looked like she was about to laugh.</p> <p>"Not this time!" I said. "We've got to start somewhere else and right now!"</p> <p>She gave me a sly sneer, and I almost had to smile, because her expression told me that perhaps we weren't going to make it.</p> <p>"What if I don't cum first?" she asked.</p> <p>Well, I was a little apprehensive about that but I wasn't going to complain about the rest of the evening. I could almost see the desire in her eyes as she looked at my stiff cock and licked her lips.</p> <p>"Well, you can't ask for that," I decided, "but, I guess we'll have to take the bull by the horns. And, I don't care what you do. You've done it with a few other women, and I'm still horny for you!"</p> <p>"Well, you've made an old man very happy, you know?" she said slyly.</p> <p>She was right. I definitely felt a little guilty about it, and the more I let it in, the more it seemed to be like she was making up for her lack of experience with males. I'd even had one or two with guys, but this was different, much different. Still, I was eager, anxious to get it over with, and I wanted to enjoy every moment of it.</p> <p>She wasn't lying. I didn't know what to feel about it, and I was definitely not comfortable about it, so I was going to play the fool by trying to avoid it.</p> <p>Anyway, we had started it. She'd gotten it through with just a simple touch of our fingertips andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
