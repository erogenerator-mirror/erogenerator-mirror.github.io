The caller ID identified that the caller was a very attractive fellow about my own age. It was definitely not my normal style of being rude to strangers.</p> <p>A pleasant voice, then... Hello? Hello!</p> <p>"This is Sam, from London."</p> <p>"Hello." "Have you seen Gwen?"</p> <p>"No, where am I supposed to call her, she doesn't call me any more. Why?"</p> <p>There was another pause, another pause, then she giggled.</p> <p>"I really don't have a plan on how to get off but I'll come by at a moment's notice. I want to see her tonight. Is that okay?"</p> <p>"Of course it's lovely but I haven't taken my car yet," I lied.</p> <p>"Well, as we've discussed a few times at home. I think you might well take my car and run some errands."</p> <p>"Sure, so long as it's to your place first." I sounded excited as I said it. Sam giggled, she sounded amused.</p> <p>"Sure, just make sure you aren't getting any early morning visitors."</p> <p>"Thanks! Of course, I'll call." Then she hung up the phone.</p> <p>I lay down on my bed on the bed that is our flat and stared at the ceiling, trying to make sense of what just happened. It is just that I am starting to really think about Gwen and that's not helping any. I need to figure out a way to go through that with her. It doesn't appear that I am ready to play hooky here at the moment. I wonder if she will want to take me somewhere.</p> <p>As I started to fall asleep, I got a phone call from Gwen in London. She sounded pleased with the phone call, in fact she sounded a bit excited when she answered it.</p> <p>"We're having a little bit of a party this evening, I was just in the area, maybe it would be a good idea if I can invite Gwen over for our evening out. I've got a few things to catch my eye. So, where are we going?"</p> <p>"I'm in your flat. It's in an upstairs building."</p> <p>"Oh, sounds lovely." I turned over and fell asleep again. It was my first real thought about Gwen.</p> <p>I woke up about an hour or so later. I was lying on my back, the bed was a bit warm, with the smell of perfume still on my pillow. I felt very much like I was in a hotel room with Gwen. Perhaps I just wasn't prepared for this. I tried to shake myself awake. That wasn't quite the response that I had expected. It was no doubt that we had been a bit...entered.</p> <p>A little later, Gwen came into the flat. She looked a bit pale, her eyes cast down. I thought she had become very self conscious. After a minute or so I felt her relax and then smile.</p> <p>"You look very nice too, from the time I walked into the flat this morning, I really can't call myself Gwen."</p> <p>"Thanks, I am very glad you're here, the party sounded like we might have a good time. If you're really going to come, I feel like you'd be too shy to try and join." I tried to act a bit coy but I was a bit scared. After a few seconds however, I became very aware again of what Gwen was doing. We were both naked. "How about you, could we watch TV for a while?"</p> <p>"Sure, I'll be fine," she mumbled, though she sounded a little embarrassed.</p> <p>"Oh, I'd love to watch."</p> <p>That was a good start for what was to come. I quickly put on some clothes that I had taken off, and then went to my bedroom to get dressed. I looked in my closet, then found that the back wall was a couple of drawers, I found the DVD on the shelf behind the door. They both had titles with a girl's character on it. I got undressed and put the DVD into the player. I pulled off my shirt and walked back to the bed. When I turned the knob of the lamp and stepped to the side, Gwen and Samantha walked out to the living room.</p> <p>"That was quite an evening," Gwen said smiling at me. "It's a shame that I can't join us tonight. What do you think of your friend here? Do you like her?"</p> <p>"I think she's very lovely."</p> <p>"And, you'll get to see her a bit atâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
