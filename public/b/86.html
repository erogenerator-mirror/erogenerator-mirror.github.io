I heard her moan as I felt her squeeze me for the first time in a very long time and then I felt the first contractions of her vagina as her climax started. I was right behind as I felt my sperm building in my balls and realized with pride that I was going to take over some sort of control while she climaxed.</p> <p>With a moan I felt the hot juice surge through my cock and I knew it was time to take her again as she lifted herself on the couch and my cock slid into her hot box. We both moaned as we fucked in unison. Her head was back and I ran my hands over her soft hair as I kissed down to her neck and kissed behind her ear where my face went as she reached around and gripped my ass pulling me into her. We were kissing and kissing, grinding into each other in a rhythm that neither of us could match. I felt the first contractions of her orgasm as the first contraction caught her on the bottom of her spine.</p> <p>Her hips were pumping her hips and I felt her vagina contract and her pussy clench around my cock. Her legs were shaking and shaking around me as the second contractions flooded her vagina with cum. It was over all too soon, I could feel the second cum as it rushed up my cock and my knees got so weak I fell on the couch and she on the floor next to me. We had never before cummed before and the feeling of it made me feel as though my cock was going to explode. She grabbed my head and began kiss me like her life depended on it, my legs fell back to the couch and she pressed her body against mine as her orgasm went on and on. I heard her moaning into my mouth as the contractions of her vagina ran up and down her shaft.</p> <p>She was still in the midst of her orgasm when we both fell fast asleep naked in my bed, her head in my lap. I woke up a few hours later to the smell of cooking and looking up I saw my lover, my dream lover lying next to me with her breasts in my face and my cock in her mouth. We lay in bed making slow love while she licked me, kissing me as I ran my fingers up and down her silky smooth legs.</p> <p>In the morning I awoke to her soft body pressed up against me. She was laying right behind me and I could feel her breasts pressed against my chest, her legs stretched out to snuggle me. We lay there for awhile kissing my face as her hand caressed my chest, playing and teasing my nipple through the layers of thin cloth. I thought I was going to come any second in her dream but was shocked when suddenly her other hand reached for my cock, stroking it slowly as she licked on my neck and cheek, kissing on my lips softly.</p> <p>My hands roamed all over her body as she caressed my face. Her tongue found its way up my neck and she licked all over my body, licking over my chest as she moved towards her breasts. She gently took one of her tits in her hand and rubbed it with both hands making my cock twitch and throb in her hand. My fingers ran over the skin of her areolas circling around the nipple and then down her body to her pussy, lightly running my fingers along the lips before feeling the slick silk of her pussy and rubbing my fingers over her vagina. She shivered under my touch and pushed herself harder against my fingers.</p> <p>She slowly started moving towards my lips and I quickly lifted my fingers to my lips then stuck my tongue out and tasted her as my hands slid back her long hair as I pulled her head back and kissed her. The scent of her perfume on my face became heavier and she pressed her hips into me harder as she thrust her tongue into my mouth. Slowly we made our way into the bedroom and when I got there she was lying on her side playing with herself, moaning words of passion into my ear as she kissed me.</p> <p>She slowly took my boxers off and moved over and began to kiss down my throat, teasing me with tiny nips of her tongue as it teased the tender skin that was my nipples. When she got to my lips, my lips parted and our tongues flicked against each other as she pulled my boxers down. She looked into my eyes as she did this and I felt her breasts brushing against my chest as she lowered herself on top of me.</p> <p>I loved the feeling of her weight on top of me and we rolled around on the blanket naked except for my shorts. I felt her pussy pressing down on my cock and we both moaned in pleasure. She moved down my body stopping for a kiss on my stomach then pulled down on my shorts until she got to my cock and her hand wrapped around the shaft as she kissed and licked the head.
