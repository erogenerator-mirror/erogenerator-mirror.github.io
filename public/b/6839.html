My member was beginning to flag a little as a wave of nervousness hit me.</p> <p>"I'm going to go get the other one," she said. Just so I could get up and leave it in the middle of her chest and then wait for a few minutes in case it did make me uncomfortable. No need, even for her to want to feel her breasts under her shirt, she said, as she walked off leaving me staring off in a way I'd never seen her do in high school.</p> <p>I was about to leave when she returned. It was another surprise.</p> <p>"Is that you, Josh?" she said with her hands on her hips.</p> <p>"Yeah, I just didn't expect...I mean...it..." I said as she held up the other breast. They were the first two she had since she had been pregnant. They were perfect, her breasts so much bigger than those of her kids. "It looks like I'm going to have to take care of this all right?" I said. Her nipples were erect and pointed at me. I put a finger to my lips to get her attention at this point, and she looked down at me. She gave a laugh, not very much, and it sounded faraway now. "Yeah," she said in a small voice. "And...I was thinking about you."</p> <p>It had been a while since someone had been naked in front of me. Well, for some reason it was my turn to blush a bit as she held her left breast to my nose. She smiled and giggled, pulling her finger away from my lips. I pulled in, breathing a bit harder just as she had done.</p> <p>"It's still really nice to see someone you know before they make love to you," she said in almost a whisper.</p> <p>My cock jumped to life, and she stared down at it for a moment. She then pulled against her shirt, revealing her cleavage again for a while. She looked down on me and started feeling herself up again; just a bit; like she was just looking for a compliment from me. I leaned into her once more, inhaling the scent of her skin on my neck.</p> <p>"I like...your smell," I said.</p> <p>"Don't be shy," she said with a wink. "Your body is gorgeous."</p> <p>I smiled then to try and cover up as much as possible.</p> <p>"Thanks," I said. "For...you know? For letting me...for that long, if I might say so," I added. I leaned in closer again, so close it took my breath away for a second.</p> <p>She leaned in, pressing her breasts against me again, the smell of her skin now all the way up to my face. I was breathing deeply now as her chest was making me feel so good. Her breasts were soft and pliable and inviting against me all at the same time; she had the feel of softness in her soft and silky skin. I could feel her hard nipples on top of my own chest.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful," I said.</p> <p>She pulled herself back away from me again, and we looked at each other. "So are you," she said.</p> <p>I looked straight at her. "Are you sure?" I asked her. "Can you tell me what that smell means?"</p> <p>She nodded her head as a small smile formed on her lips.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I again asked. "It's really good to smell, right?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I can say that," she said with some urgency. "Just breathe."</p> <p>"Okay," I said.</p> <p>She sat down next to me with her legs spread slightly. She took a big whiff, a bit of her, mostly the scent of her panties mixed with mine. She was absolutely still. I looked down at her breasts.</p> <p>"Is it just the natural smell I have on you?" I asked, trying to put some of the anger out that had seemed to be building.</p> <p>"No, more than that," she said. "It's just...this was a fantasy...to have someone...to give me this," she finished as she slowly pulled her shirt up, "this kind of control. This is not a fantasy," she said. "I think I'm very hot to have you look at me like this..." she paused for a second as she brought her hands to her shirt. She pulled the shirt up and over her head. It did not cover a bit of her chest but it would have if she had worn the same shirt she wore at home. If she would have put the shirt on again just wearing the pants, I would have seenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
