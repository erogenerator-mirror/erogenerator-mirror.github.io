If you'd like to look at it, you can look."</p> <p>"Do you think we can do it?"</p> <p>"Oh I think so, you just have to make the right choice. We're going to do it"</p> <p>So they had a really good time talking on the phone and dancing. After that the two of them went back to the room without a single word between them.</p> <p>After they finished their drinks the two of them walked out to the truck and walked to the hotel room room and got in. Then they came together and held each other and kissed passionately. It's been six years since they had last had sex together. It started slow and took them a while to get to the point where they had a climax. They were on the bed when they had finished.</p> <p>They said goodnight and went to bed while caressing each others bodies. They kissed many times before lying down together and they fell asleep without looking at each other.</p> <p>The next day at the shop they found a box of flowers and opened it and found two different bouquets. They took the bouquets and went to work for the flowers.</p> <p>When they came back home they got dressed and went out to work. Since it was a business trip they only had a couple of stops so they had to pick two of them. They had a nice lunch before walking around in the park trying to find some of the flowers. When they did find some the flowers were at a very good price. They had to take them back before they left to get the next one.</p> <p>They were sitting at the picnic table after they have had lunch and talking when they heard the key inside. They turned and walked up to the door. It was on a very pretty street and the lights were in quite high and the trees and bushes were so beautiful. It was almost like it was the first time they had seen each other in person.</p> <p>When he came to the door it was open and there was a little guy standing there. It was the first time he had seen him.</p> <p>"Hello" was all he said. This he did not take back.</p> <p>When he saw them he said " Hello."</p> <p>"Can I get you something to drink?"</p> <p>"No thanks we're going home."</p> <p>The guys headed right for the bathroom. There they went after the water bottles. When they were done in the bathroom they went downstairs to get the men's room. This room had a separate bathroom. The door was closed so the man went in first. They heard the shower so he decided to sneak into the men's room before he looked in all the way. So they went back out into the shop to go to the water. As soon as they were back in the shop he said, "I just couldn't believe we are about to do this."</p> <p>"You are going to get your chance."</p> <p>"How could I get the chance without telling you. If you tell me the truth, this is going to happen anytime I want it. You'll understand when I tell you, I'm doing it."</p> <p>"I can't believe I haven't done it before."</p> <p>"Do it now or you will regret ever meeting me."</p> <p>He went into the men's room, and he shut the door and looked in there. He saw a small mirror, he looked and there was dried cum on his neck and face. He saw his body looking in the mirror, "How did you know?"</p> <p>"When I was in the shower this morning, I saw you."</p> <p>She said, "I thought that would be you."</p> <p>She smiled, "No it wasn't him, but I'm sure that was me."</p> <p>"Where did you get this from?"</p> <p>"I was out with a mate this weekend. How do you know?"</p> <p>"I think she got a good vibe on you."</p> <p>"That will never happen again."</p> <p>"If you tell me. I will never speak to you again."</p> <p>"So this is what you're about to do?"</p> <p>"Yes, this is who I am. You will always be the one doing this. We will always do it together, so when you meet me, this isâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
