He can't help it or it makes it difficult to see what's the cause. That's it...that's it it...it's it...the big one in his ...over his ...uh..." She moved from breast to breast and back. "Hank ...I'm so sorry I didn't tell you..." She stopped for a moment. "Look he's only fifteen and..."</p> <p>"It's no big deal. It's nothing you'll worry about, it's nice...I'll bet it might hurt a little, but it's nothing for my sissies too much to feel any pain. They're fun to play with..."</p> <p>- "Yeah, I bet they don't hurt at all."</p> <p>- "No not really. I'm just curious what it would be like, to be with you."</p> <p>Kneeling up, she pulled him down on his back. He pulled her down against his chest and looked at her. "No kidding."</p> <p>- "We'll get on with this later."</p> <p>Kissing his ear again, she took his chin gently in her hand and opened his eyes. Taking his lips, she kissed him deeply. Slowly...but passionately. Holding him close to her, she slowly moved to straddle him.</p> <p>- "I'm not sure about this. I can just see this as being too much, like it was for you...like he'd be a stranger." She kissed his lips softly and moved her kisses to his nose. He reached up under her nightshirt and held her as they laid kissing with eyes closed. Finally, she pulled away long enough to slide onto his lap and sit down on his dick. It slid up inside her with no problem. She moved her leg up to rest her foot on his foot. As she started to ride up and down on him, she played with his nipples, rolling one around her finger, and stroking his cock. It made her wet to watch, watching him fuck her while she did it made her wet...it was so hot and erotic watching her take him.</p> <p>He reached up to pinch her nipple and she moved her hand down to stroke his cock. She stroked him with her pussy while he fucked her, then began to stroke him harder. With her eyes closed, she moved her hips in circular motions up and down with his legs, rubbing her clit. "Fuck him...I..." She could barely say the words as she fucked her first time with two guys at a party, the first time they had even seen each other. "Fuck him hard!" She went at it for nearly two hours each.</p> <p>When it was time to fuck Hank from underneath, it was a lot longer. He sat on the mattress while she rode him, he held on to her hips as they started going at it again. As much as he loved her, she still had more energy to spend. They fucked all night and into the early morning. As the morning had worn on, they fucked until it was almost 4 am on the first day after the break up. They never got a chance to stop when they arrived there the next night. As they slept, he lay her down on her back and slipped her shorts and panties off, followed by his shorts and briefs. He didn't take that time before he started kissing down her body. Kneeling back, he took off her night shirt and shorts and her white bra. She took him in her arms and he began to kiss and suck her breasts. He kissed and sucked her nipples through her bra until she pulled his head tighter. They fucked and fucked until they were spent. Finally she fell asleep, her breathing deepened and she was the last thing he heard before waking up the next day with the alarm at 8 am.</p> <p>- "Kneel down here." He said with a smile and she looked down. Not only didn't she have to wear panties, she did.</p> <p>- "'K." He said.</p> <p>Before she could stand, he knelt in front of her and pulled her legs apart. He used his fingers to part her lips. He slowly kissed her clit before moving his finger up to tease her. "Hank, please stop."</p> <p>- "Do I want to stop?"</p> <p>He kissed her lips again, then moved forward and opened her. "Yes, you can be sure." He said it so plainly and quickly. "Hank, I'm really not interested in guys right now, you can watch and you can decide if you want to fuck me, then tell me when you're ready. Just do it." He said it so quietly, yet with the same sense of urgency in his voice. Her heart began to beat faster and harder and she moaned when he pushed the finger inside of her. He kept it there for a little andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
