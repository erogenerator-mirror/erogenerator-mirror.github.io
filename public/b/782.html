Her soft white flesh was the same way it had been for me before; she still had those beautiful red nails and her white blouse gave a hint of her firm breasts. Her nipples were still tight and very sensitive to the touch. She lifted a breast in each hand, then wrapped the two fingers around each one and squeezed gently. They felt so nice in my hands. I leaned forward and kissed each nipple gently. They seemed to grow harder in her warm soft hand. I continued to knead them, kissing the top of each.</p> <p>Her eyes were closed as she leaned back and I slowly moved one hand up her body until the tips of my fingers reached her bra clasp. I loosened it and looked at the deep crimson color of her areola.</p> <p>“That’s better,” she breathed. She had the tip of her finger under it. I pulled it to my mouth and kissed it again, running two of my fingers through her bra strap. As I kissed her nipple, I removed the top strap and looked down to her breast. Her nipple was standing out just enough for me to see the shape of it, the large pinkish brown areola and her soft areola, and the size of her nipple. She moaned softly and leaned back against me.</p> <p>I looked at her breasts again, slowly and carefully, as if I was memorizing every detail. My breathing began to quicken and my heart rate accelerated. I leaned over her and kissed her left breast. “It’s lovely,” she whispered. I sucked on it gently. I ran my tongue around her areola and slowly ran my tongue across her nipple.</p> <p>She felt my tongue run across her nipple and I ran it around in circles, sending tingles through her body, which seemed to increase the longer I kept working her boob. She moved her other breast to my other hand, so I could run my hand across her nipple too. She started moaning again, a deep throaty moan, but she had closed her eyes again. I ran my thumb across her aureola and she started to tremble. I kissed her breast again and gently kissed her ribs, then moved one hand to her right breast. Her warm soft skin felt so good against my mouth.</p> <p>I leaned forward and kissed her neck softly, leaving kisses, licks, and bites for another minute while my tongue played across her skin. My hand kept moving across her breast and slowly caressing her breast. My lips moved slowly down her chest and I moved to her stomach, leaving kisses on each spot.</p> <p>Soon I could feel that soft hand move down her body. It went under the elastic of her skirt and slowly touched her bare thigh. She raised her hips and lifted her skirt, and her fingers reached for my hard cock through my pants. She grabbed it and pulled it out. “Ooh! Look at that! What a lovely cock you have!” and then she licked the tip, running her tongue across the head. My penis responded almost immediately to her tongue. I felt her hand gently rubbing my shaft. She opened her hand, stroked my balls, and began to use her tongue on my head. I was fully erect and hard in her hand. She looked up at me licking her lips. I lifted my cock off my pants and she got up on her knees, pulled off my boxers, and pulled me toward her. I moved to her and she moved so her breasts were close to my ear, and she began unbuttoning my shirt. I lifted my hands to her shoulders and slipped it off. She stopped, and said, “No, take it off, I want to see you.” She looked over at the screen of my tablet while she unhooked her bra. I raised my hand and she lowered it so just one finger touched her nipple. She moved her face back toward my hand and I moved it slowly to my mouth so I could taste her body. I moved my hand lower, down her thighs and back to her bottom. I knelt down between her legs.</p> <p>“No! I don’t want you to do that!” she said and grabbed my shirt and pulled me toward her, but she couldn’t see what I was doing anymore. I was now standing up in front of her, holding my shirt up and my pants down, as she pulled me close to her. My penis jutted out between us and she pulled the skin of my belly to expose my scrotum. I moved to her ear and kissed one, lightly on the top of her upper lobe, then slid my face up to her neck and sucked on the nipple while she stro—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
