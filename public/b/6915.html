I'm in the business of selling sexual aids," he said smiling.</p> <p>She could not keep her hands from her breasts and was rubbing herself with them. "I don't sell anything. I just sell it to the women you work with."</p> <p>"A woman like me needs to be sold just like her. I just sell all these things to my clients. So how about you? Would you like to give me a lift," he asked.</p> <p>"Sure. How much did you charge?"</p> <p>"You want me to give you 200 to 200?"</p> <p>"No, go in the shop. We can buy what you need for the whole weekend."</p> <p>"Why don't you buy me something nice and you can have the place to yourself," Sarah said.</p> <p>"I don't have anything nice to buy for you."</p> <p>"I don't understand. I didn't pay what I needed to shop. Besides, I don't have anything nice to give," she said walking away.</p> <p>"What you don't have is the money," he said handing her a small, half-filled bottle. "Here, drink this," he added taking the bottle to her.</p> <p>She took the glass and took a sip. She took the glass back and thanked him. "Thank you, that's really nice," she said.</p> <p>Sarah looked over at his hand rubbing up and down in her lap. He smiled at her as he sat there. He knew he had her hooked on him.</p> <p>"Sarah, do you want me to talk to someone?" she asked as she wiped her eyes.</p> <p>"What? Why can't you?" he asked.</p> <p>"You want to be with me."</p> <p>"Yeah, that's what you think. I've been with a woman. I can't be with you," he said giving her a stern look. "I want you to know that. Do you know what I do when I talk to a woman about sex?"</p> <p>"I don't," she said taking the glass from him and taking a drink.</p> <p>"I know what I do when men talk about sex. I'm not interested in being with you just because it's the right thing to do," he said. "So ask your friend. Ask her about how she is."</p> <p>She was about to object but knew she couldn't. If he wanted her to talk she would, maybe, she would give him a chance and see what he did when he saw her.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes, I'm sure. How about you Sarah, can you give me a chance?" he asked.</p> <p>"Sarah isn't interested in me," she said giving him a small smile.</p> <p>"It's true. I have a crush on you. The sex with your friend is just between you and me. It wasn't that your sex-life didn't turn out as good as it did though," he said sitting up.</p> <p>"But Sarah wouldn't mind fucking me," she argued with a sigh.</p> <p>"No. I don't think she is interested in having sex with you. Maybe when she sees my business she'll agree," he said sitting back down. He was thinking that he would keep her here for as long as he could as long as it took him getting her to agree to him.</p> <p>Sarah was trying to think of his business in terms that wouldn't cause her to become a lesbian. She knew this would be stupid on his part. Not a man's business, Sarah thought. She knew she didn't want to know. It would just be for the rest of their lives, she promised herself.</p> <p>"How about I just let you go. You know you wanted me to," she said sitting up.</p> <p>"I know. But I want you so much," Sarah said turning to walk away.</p> <p>"Sarah. Please don't do this. You don't have me. I think I would be a better lover if you went," he said stepping in front of her.</p> <p>"Well I don't know. This shouldn't be happening. I mean it will be great for you to have me anyway you want," she said walking away.</p> <p>"It isn't good for me seeing you like this," he said with a frowning look on his face.</p> <p>"Don't be sorry," she said giving him a smile. "I don't understand. I'm sorry. I'm happy just having you here with me. Besides I need you naked and topless to be my bed," she said giving him a smirk.</p> <p>"Maybe. I'm not here nude. I had to take a shower and shave my legs but that's not why I came here. It won't take me long," he said standing up and walking towards her.</p> <p>"Ohâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
