It was all I could do to refrain from rubbing myself against the head of his tool, but I just couldn't get enough of him in my palms and mouth.</p> <p>“Take off your panties, little boy,” I whispered to him. He did so, and I lifted my legs up onto the desk, spreading them apart as he got between my thighs, and then he pushed his cock back in before he had a chance to even get in any of me. I shuddered and let out a gasp when he started to slowly move his cock into me, and he grunted as he pushed all the way into me.</p> <p>“Oh, damn, that’s good. So fucking good,” he gritted his teeth as he buried himself fully into me, and started to move in and out slowly. It felt good, but it also felt wrong.</p> <p>“Don’t fucking stop,” he begged. “I’m about to shoot my load. Take me out of your mouth and suck me. I want you to swallow everything.” I did so, but to my astonishment, he just kept on fucking me in the middle of the office.</p> <p>“I'm gonna cum,” he gasped.</p> <p>“Oh, please, shoot your wad into me,” I breathed.</p> <p>He began to fuck me harder and faster, and I could feel an explosion coming. “You want your cum, don’t you, little fucker? You want a nice load, don’t you? You’ve got to cum for me, little fucker. Cum for your mistress.”</p> <p>It felt so good, and it made the head of his cock rub against my g-spot, and that was more than I could take so I gripped the desk in my hands and threw my head back into the chair in the corner of the room, and felt him shiver and go even harder as I did so, making every deep penetration seem so very hard, but to my surprise, he didn’t pull his cock out, though it stayed in the warmth and tightness of my pussy, the head of his cock rubbing up and down and across the back of my clit in little circles. It must have been so hard to concentrate on what I was doing to him, but in a strange way it was actually rather flattering really. It was like I was really looking into his eyes as he looked up into me, with my own eyes looking into mine, and I could feel my body beginning to tense up, as it was the most intense orgasm I had ever experienced, and I knew that I was gonna cum again. It was the best orgasm I had ever had, and I could hardly tell you which orgasm was the best.</p> <p>As I lay there in my chair, waiting, I looked down at his member, which looked exactly as it had been, and decided to go ahead and give him a handjob myself, but I didn’t have to put out my own cum. I took his cock at the base, and guided the head to my lips, and my tongue came out to lick up what my lips and tongue had got, and then I went down onto my knees, and started to tongue his balls. I was really loving it, and felt the excitement building to new levels as I sucked, and it wasn’t long before he made himself tense, and his cock erupted, cumming in my mouth as he spurted out the first spurt, and I swallowed it down my throat, the warmth and pleasure so intense. I was still licking up whatever I could off his cock when he finally got off me, and then sat back and just looked at you. “Why did you stop?” I gasped. He looked at me as if he was going to ask why I stopped.</p> <p>“I told you, it feels fantastic,” he said. He seemed to know that I had meant that, too, for in my mind I knew that I was just being honest, as if he would just look at me and say, “I like it.” But he was too surprised to speak, and I kept quiet. He still looked pretty disappointed, though.</p> <p>“It didn’t hurt, did it, Sir?” he said, in an almost fatherly tone. I started to relax a bit.</p> <p>“No, no, I didn’t hurt you much,” I assured him. “That was rather nice of you to do so, a girl, I mean.”</p> <p>He wasn’t as smart as—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
