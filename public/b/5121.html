I made sure the room was dark and quiet, and I set the dish on the coffee table. I knew that if I couldn't see what was going on there would be an alternative way to my wife that was better than fucking my cock. I flipped the channel and found the local news feed for the local television station. The station broadcast sports. There hadn't been much talk in the last twenty min, so I had to be confident with myself. The announcer said that the home team was celebrating a big win! With that I turned back the small television and tuned to the local news show showing a big win. The news reporter said that football fans were the big football fan crowd.</p> <p>I thought about how I might be able to tell her what was going on, but the only woman she knew was a black man. I figured it was better with a black lady, even the most famous black woman on the television. I dialed her number and a voice mail answered. If she were black I was about to call the cops when she answered in a tone that said "No it's a white woman not black".</p> <p>I knew if I answered the phone right away that she would hear the voice. I knew she would hear me, but I didn't think she would be offended. We talked for a few more minutes after the call ended. She then told me that she had not seen her husband for a while, but that some of their friends had decided not to go to their apartment.</p> <p>She then told me that some of the young girls were planning on attending her graduation party. They couldn't wait to join the girl's. They were going to come from school together. There had to be a way to persuade all of the girls and boys into joining them. She didn't want to miss the party. I listened intently, wondering what she was planning on doing.</p> <p>She then told me that they were going to stay another night, and that she would let them use the bedroom. They had agreed to keep their key and their van. They would not see the keys until morning. She told me how happy she was that they had decided to stay with them, and I thanked her.</p> <p>I told her we wouldn't be back until late morning. Just a few minutes ago we had discussed it. I made sure her window was closed while I drove in. Then I drove back to my house. I told the housekeeper that my car would be returning at 7:30 am if the door was locked. They said they were very glad to have me come home, and that I could come back whenever the house was empty.</p> <p>I didn't return home until 10:00 am. I called the housekeeper to let her know where our rooms were. I had one of our spare rooms in the basement. The rest of our furniture was there while it was going in the garage that morning. It was a perfect place to have her. I walked in the door at about 8:30 am.</p> <p>I opened the door for her and she went back inside as soon as I was out of earshot. The rest of the evening went by in a blur. I didn't even have to think about leaving my wife to go out somewhere alone before I had a chance to get her to agree to go down there. I just got to know her and that is all that I need right now. I'm sure of it.</p> <p>At exactly 7:30 pm I heard her in her bedroom. I figured she had just gotten up and left. After locking the door and locking it, I entered the room. She was lying on the bed and she was naked. She was on her stomach on the bed, and her legs were spread wide. I could see her breasts moving as she lay on her stomach. She was staring at the ceiling as I came in.</p> <p>I wanted so much to take her right then and there, but I knew that she had to get going soon. I wasn't going to let her go out of town on some cheap excuse. I stripped out of my clothes and sat on the bed. She had to get up and get ready, so that was where I would have to wait a few minutes until she got up.</p> <p>I started slowly touching myself. I used one hand to caress my breasts and the other my crotch. I slowly rubbed my right hand over my clitoris and between my labia. By the time she got downstairs I was close to climaxing and wanted more time with her. I pulled my hand away as soon as she opened the bedroom door. I sat, and she did, before turning on the light. I took off my clothes and sat there naked for a few seconds before I started to put on my clothes. I didn't want to give her all my mind or feelings about what I was about to do.</p> <p>When I finallyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
