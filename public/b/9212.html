She told me to be patient and that we would be doing much more now. I was to be totally honest with her when I told her of my experience with her last girlfriend and I couldn't help but to add an additional item to the night that I knew would end with me having an orgasm.</p> <p>"Have you really done it with your girlfriend?" she asked as she stood next to me.</p> <p>I hesitated before telling her how I had been fantasizing over her on more than one occasion that evening. The fact that she had made love to me while we were together was the ultimate in the betrayal of my feelings towards her. It seemed that she had also confessed and I was not to worry about what she expected of me. I went on to say that I had never had such an experience with anyone and that I had never gone all the way with anyone. She smiled and moved her hand to stroke my cheek and I felt the tingling in my leg, which again she did not miss as she caressed my cheek for a moment and then began caressing my hair. After a short minute of touching my hair, she leaned her head back and opened her lips. I opened mine and our mouths were immediately joined in an amazing and completely different way by kissing and caressing each other's lips and tongue. We continued to kiss with the increasing level of passion in both of us.</p> <p>"How would you like to go further?" she smiled up at me as she held my face and brought my mouth down again to capture its tongue.</p> <p>"Do you remember the first time I watched you do that?"</p> <p>"Of course!"</p> <p>"I have had a few times, but never anything as mind blowing as that one. It's so much better in person than I did in porn."</p> <p>"I know what you mean," I replied.</p> <p>"Me too, you know! I'm getting horny."</p> <p>"Me too!"</p> <p>She reached into my jeans to get my cock. She was very gentle with it and when she gave me my first blowjob I let out a soft groan when she felt my cock in her hand.</p> <p>"What you doing?" I asked her as she started kissing and sucking on my neck as her hand moved up and down along my shaft and the other one massaged my balls.</p> <p>"You're enjoying it don't you?"</p> <p>"What's that?</p> <p>She lifted up my shirt and massaged my breasts, rolling the nipples and caressing their weight. She moved down to lick my nipples very lightly and then started sucking and licking her way down. I started to moan in pleasure and soon was holding her head in my hands. When her tongue made its way along my navel area, my groans were almost inaudible. She then parted my legs with her hand and slowly rubbed the inside of her thighs while moving the fingers of her other hand back out and touching my pussy lips. I could feel my lips quivering in anticipation as she was very skilled at this. It wasn't long before my mouth was open and I was moving my hips to meet hers. In response to my reaction to her touch, she brought her two fingers up to my mouth and then spread my pussy lips with some force until the wetness of my juices were on her fingers.</p> <p>"Oh, you are very wet!" she told me, which made me think that I had just agreed to this.</p> <p>I felt her hand on my body again as she got onto the bed on her back and slid her body up against mine. I felt her body moving against me as her breasts rolled against my chest. I opened one eye when she put her hand on my face and leaned towards me. "I love you, you know."</p> <p>"I know you do."</p> <p>She kissed me with urgency and pulled my face towards her boobs. We were kissing as my hand moved to the back of her neck and caressed her neck muscles as I felt her nipples hardening and her hands moving along my back. Her kisses and the touch and caress of her hands against my chest was more like a sexual explosion than an orgasm for both of us. When she finally broke off, I put my mouth in her chest and pushed it towards my mouth and tried to bite her breasts and rub them with my mouth. Her boobs were quite firm, but not too soft either. I licked them and put them in my mouth and tasted the sweetness and excitement that I felt there to my extreme satisfaction.</p> <p>She rolled my face back up towards her neck and I kissed the back of her soft hairline all over. When I did this I felt her hips push forward against mine as my erection rubbed along her thigh. I took my hand away from her neck and put a finger into her pussy. She shivered in anticipation from the sensation and soon Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
