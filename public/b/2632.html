He said.</p> <p>I smiled and pulled him to a chair by the fire. "There is one thing that I want to make clear about. I am not an exhibitionist and I don't want you to think I am." I said.</p> <p>I sat him in the chair and slowly unbuttoned my blouse. He watched as I undid the last button and took his hand in mine and began to caress it.</p> <p>"Let's not go that way" he said as he pulled me closer to him.</p> <p>I pulled my blouse over my head and he caressed my breasts that hungrily in the loose fitting bra that I kept. I was glad he was aware of my preference but I wanted him now, I wanted that special cock of his.</p> <p>I unbuckled his belt and quickly freed his manhood. I was excited but a little nervous and I was excited too. We sat and gazed at each other as we caressed one breast as we felt fingers caress our pubic hair.</p> <p>I could already feel the excitement that he was feeling and I slid my hands down his pants, feeling for his hard cock. As they slid down as he lifted his hips to help, so they left him hanging free from the waist band of his slacks. He had a large mushroom head that was already very wet. When I grasped it I thought he was going to pop the end and I looked at him.</p> <p>This was all happening so fast, he did seem to have some idea what he was doing.</p> <p>I had a moment to sit on his lap and I gently took his hard cock in my hand. I slid up and then settled down on his shaft. I slowly began to move up and down, the feeling was so pleasurable. I kept my eyes wide open just letting him get use to the new experience and feel me.</p> <p>I felt his hands on my back holding me up and his mouth on my breasts. Again I began to move up and down his cock. When he began to kiss me, I let him up and down, but he kept it slow and easy.</p> <p>"Is this ok?" He asked.</p> <p>When his voice came out as "yes" I smiled and whispered "don't play with me honey, I'm yours for the taking."</p> <p>"Ok", he said as he placed his hands on my hips, guiding me as I moved up and down on his cock.</p> <p>I began to feel the sensation of his cock in and out of my pussy as it rubbed over my clit. It was then that I felt him begin to thrust up into me, I wasn't really able to hold it back much longer.</p> <p>"Yes, yes, yes, I'm cumming!" and with that I felt the climax that sent him over the edge.</p> <p>We were both sweaty but I had a new feeling of confidence that this was a first that I was going to have him again.</p> <p>"I like it" I said.</p> <p>"I liked watching you get a blowjob in the restaurant." He said.</p> <p>"Yes." I said as I began to laugh. "It's different than with you".</p> <p>"I could tell" he replied. "Come on baby, let us go and see what we can do".</p> <p>We stood, walked toward the door and he pulled me to him. His cock had found the opening to my pussy and I slipped in to meet him. We held each other and kissed. It felt good to be like this again. We sat and kissed for a long time, kissing one another till our kisses gave way to whispers.</p> <p>"I love you," he said as he looked at me. "Let's go" he said as he stood. "This time please let me kiss you."</p> <p>He moved toward the open door. I walked to him, our naked bodies swaying as we walked. I was enjoying feeling him up. I loved that feeling. I reached out and felt his cock. It was huge. It was hard and it was ready, but now it was getting the hard part. I reached for my blouse and pulled the straps off, and his eyes went wide. I held him, he stroked my breasts with one hand and played with my pussy with another. I took him in my hand and he was almost fully hard. We walked into the house, where he had his arms around my waist and I was holding myself with one hand under his leg with the other running along his balls and I could feel his hardness. He pulled me close and kissed me in a long slow passionate French kiss.</p> <p>The sensation was electric.</p> <p>We walked back into the family room and I pulled down the blanket and we walked toward him and began to undress.
