I'm so glad you're back. You are too. I love being back with you. It was so nice of you to let me know of you when you were away. The more you said goodby, the nicer it got.'</p> <p>That last one was really mean. It got me to thinking about what it could do to my relationship with Steve and I decided to write that note.</p> <p>In response to a message I got to the point of a question and I quickly answered it. I had thought of that question and I guess I was trying to write that note, but I had to think about what it might mean to have Steve take the note away.</p> <p>There was a phone call from Steve. The phone rang again on my end and this time there was a different number.</p> <p>'Hey, it's me,' I said, trying to use the voice mail. At this point I had a thought, 'You know, I love to hear you say that sometimes.'</p> <p>'So am I?' Was that Steve's response; my mind raced to think a response, but there was nothing. I thought it might be important to wait until the next night. I could see Steve in the distance with his back to the car.</p> <p>'Yeah. Of course, of course. Just be careful.'</p> <p>Later that evening I found Steve was still in bed. He was in boxer shorts. I wondered what he was getting up to. That night Steve's phone was ringing and that was very suspicious. I answered it and it was from Steve. As I said, Steve was away from me for a long time and I knew he was thinking about the note.</p> <p>'Ok, babe, I was just wondering if you wanted to come over in the morning before you had to be at work? I hope not because I have the day off and I would love you to come over, but for you to come up to spend it with me if you want,' Steve said.</p> <p>I guess his meaning was clear. I couldn't believe it, but he wanted to spend it with me. Steve started to sound more excited and we were both getting a bit excited with our thoughts about how it might go. I asked him, 'So, where is Steve?'</p> <p>'In the kitchen making coffee for himself, but he is not in the house,' Steve said.</p> <p>'Ok, sounds good. I'll see you at lunchtime,' I said.</p> <p>'Ok, ok. Have some coffee with me,' Steve said.</p> <p>'Ok,' I said.</p> <p>I was very confused and was not getting the impression of what he was wanting to do to me. How did he want me to answer his question of what he would want to do for me? That was a stupid question. He would never do anything to me that I didn't want. I had come so close to getting him to sleep with me, yet he had not.</p> <p>By 12 noon Steve was getting ready to go out. I asked him, 'Do you want a little longer with me?'</p> <p>'Of course I do, but I have some things planned for the day,' Steve said.</p> <p>'Sure. What are you planning?'</p> <p>'I have a special surprise for you,' Steve said, 'but if you don't know about it yet, you are going to have to help me do that,' Steve said, almost as if he was talking right next to me.</p> <p>The thought of what was really happening came to me but I was still not convinced. Steve looked at me and then said, 'I have something special planned for you, but first I thought we could surprise you.'</p> <p>I was not sure about his surprise and knew that I was to get it this afternoon. What was the surprise? When Steve and I had talked about his surprise I had told him that I wanted to wear something to surprise him, so it was my intention to wear something very erotic. The night of the holiday we had, I had dressed so nicely. It was a black satin, garter belt. I know it was a bit small on me because I didn't have much leg so I had put on a white satin bustier. Since I had shaved my pussy the night before, I could not see anything. It was a little tight, but there was the cutest looking garter belt and it looked very sexy, but I still had no intention at the shop that day. I had bought my thong a little before we were married and it was quite loose, so I wore it with the top open enough to show my bra to whoever was around and a sheer white satin short mini-skirt.</p> <p>'Come onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
