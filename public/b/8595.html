She moaned loudly as it slid deep into her body sending shivers up her spine, and she felt her legs shaking.</p> <p>"Fuck me!" she gasped, "I want you inside me!"</p> <p>He smiled down at her with her eyes locked on him. She reached out and grabbed his face and pulled him down on top of her. Lying between her legs, he began kissing her. She looked up at him, feeling her heart beat quicken as her pussy lips spread in response to the excitement. She grabbed the sides of his face and drew him down to meet her. Their tongues danced together passionately as his hands went into her hair, and he began pulling her hair back, letting her tresses cascade down her back. As he pulled her hair, she began feeling him swell inside her as he continued kissing her. He began kissing her nose, and neck, and down to her breasts where he licked and sucked them into his mouth. As he continued, she began to feel as if she was floating up in air as it was. She felt completely turned on by the feelings as his strong hands roamed her body. Her legs felt weak as he continued pulling up her dress, pulling it from her body. As he pulled her arms up above her head, she held on for dear life with her legs as he spread them apart, revealing her shaved pussy for his viewing pleasure. He then quickly pulled his finger down as she felt the first touch of his tongue as she felt him lick the juices from her slit. She felt her hands pull away as she tried to push him away. She turned in his arms, kissing him wildly, wanting him to stay inside her. Her hands again grabbed the back of his head as he lapped away at her juices as if they were honey. The moans he released from her lips could only be echoed through the room, as he continued lathering her pussy. Her legs had never been so good, and before long, she was humping into the air as her body felt it's own sexual euphoria.</p> <p>She pulled away from him, and quickly got a glass of lemonade out of her purse, then bent down to pick it up. As she reached, she saw a small silver disc in his hand. It was about two thirds the size of the bottle on top, and she realized that, as drunk as they both felt, that it was really something worth trying on in the dark. He had put it on her finger to be sure of what she was drinking because the alcohol seemed to really do that to her, as it seemed to have a mind of its own. She picked it up and looked at it, which was a strange, slightly darker color too. She laughed softly, realizing that when this began, she should of been so intoxicated, she never thought it would make her feel this good.</p> <p>She took it into her mouth and swallowed it slowly, not wanting to stop him from lapping away at her pussy. She felt him start to get hard from the alcohol, and her pussy told her that he must be liking what he saw. He reached up and began working the nipples she was fondling with his teeth, while sucking on her neck and ears. She reached down and began to rub his shaft as she continued to kiss and lick at it.</p> <p>"Take me upstairs. Now!" she screamed as she grabbed his belt buckle and began to loosen it, which made him smile.</p> <p>"Let's go where I'm going." he said as he helped her up and she quickly took off the dress he had left on her, and they went to her bedroom. As she set down on the bed, she noticed another envelope and that it was still there. She tossed it on the bed and pulled his naked body into hers. He rubbed her breast through the fabric, as she pushed back against him. She began kissing him slowly, feeling his erection pushing into her stomach as they continued to embrace. She could feel herself getting warm while she was kissing him, and she had no problem feeling wet between her legs that she was feeling. He began kissing down her neck to her heaving breasts as he pulled on her dress to reveal her beautiful, pink globes. He kissed his way down her stomach to the top of her pants and began to unbutton them.</p> <p>Without a word between them, he let her loose the dress and began to massage her pussy from its lips up through her pussy to her clit. He was already feeling her up as he continued to go down on her, when she stopped him.</p> <p>She pulled him up to sit on his knees, which she took the liberty to do with her own. She started to suck on his throbbing tool again, as she pushed him back onto the bed, so she could straddle him.
