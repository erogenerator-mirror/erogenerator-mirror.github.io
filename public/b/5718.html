This time after dinner he would go over to pick up that wine so he could have it as well as pick up his jacket. He had a long day ahead of him and was in a hurry. He was hoping that her mother would be ready to go home. He wondered if he could tell her about his day. It was a tough day for him and he had decided to take good care of it.</p> <p>He made it back to the house around 9PM. He was almost disappointed as he pulled up at his house. The house was empty. He checked the clock in front of him. It was 9:04PM and he was just a little surprised to find her in the front room. He had expected her to have the first glass of wine by now. He walked into the front room to find her sitting on the sofa drinking a glass of wine. She must have just showered. She was wearing a white turtleneck sweater with a black skirt that clung to her like a second layer of skin. It was not an outfit that he expected.</p> <p>"You must be John," she said softly.</p> <p>"I'm John," he replied, looking her up and down. "My God, you look beautiful."</p> <p>She blushed at his comment but smiled when she realized his remark.</p> <p>"You look great John. How are you?"</p> <p>"I'm good. How about you?" he continued to look at her.</p> <p>"It's been hard."</p> <p>"Oh really, I'm sure it is going to go much better," he agreed.</p> <p>She smiled again at his compliment.</p> <p>"It is," he assured her in a teasing manner. "But I guess I'm not a good judge of character at what we have done."</p> <p>She smiled coyly and shrugged her shoulders as if it were an innocuous statement.</p> <p>"You must be really tired. Go on out to bed and we'll talk again," he said as he rose to his feet, picked up his briefcase and followed her to her bedroom.</p> <p>"Why don't you go get the bottle of wine and come back in to the sitting room," John said as he turned the light off. He followed her into the sitting room. He walked toward the table she had just reached. It was full of what she liked and didn't like when he had them brought in to serve them earlier, except now, she wanted him to be sitting on the other side of the table instead of the one behind it. She had changed her look and wore a new set of clothes. He saw she was wearing one of his old black shirts which she had put on over a blue tee shirt that was just as tight as he remembered. He hoped it didn't show a little bulge in it.</p> <p>"You must think that me dressed up on my own is my best way to tell you that I am not a bad judge of character?" she asked. She had changed back into the normal clothes that he remembered from her old white blouse. Only this one had sleeves up to her elbows. He could see that she had put on some type of perfume or else. He saw that she had on some white, short sleeves that were not that tight but they were pretty long indeed. She did have a short black skirt on though as she always wore jeans. "Oh, I'm very sorry to disappoint you. But when you look like that and feel like that, it makes me feel like a teenager when at home," he replied.</p> <p>"Well, if you look like that and you dress too sexy, I know there would be a guy out there who would think that he was in love with you, which is pretty easy to get a rise out of my date with you. I'm sure that you won't mind seeing me in something like it. I mean, I think you're lovely. And you have the look that would make a girl want to be a little girl with you for once. I guess you will just have to decide for yourself what you want to do to get some of that in you," she told him as she smiled at him.</p> <p>He noticed that she was holding the wine so he took a sip and then took a long drink. It did make her take a sip as she did when she really got into it. She was definitely trying to loosen him up. He thought he had never been this excited while she was around, but then his excitement mounted again when he took a big swallow of the wine. It had just been a few minutes since she had been there alone and he felt like he was about the time that he had to leave the house to go sit in his office and check out the books. He finished off the glassâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
