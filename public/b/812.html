I'll just use them."</p> <p>Amber agreed and they set about the task, hanging large cushions from rafters before folding them over in long loops. They even put another cushion there as I walked back into the kitchen area to get drinks. Amber finished her work and went to find me. "Where have I put this cushions!" she said, looking at them with a twinkle in her eye.</p> <p>"Oh, you know the place. You're the one that made this up a couple of months ago! I had to buy some new work shoes. I haven't gone a lot, so that's why I had to get this for a living."</p> <p>"Really, don't take anything for granted! I'll pick them up when you want. Are we even now?"</p> <p>"We'll see. This one has a pool too." I could tell she took a look at the pool, but was content if that. We finished our drinks, and I walked over to the pool.</p> <p>"Thanks!" Amber said as I walked into the cool water with her.</p> <p>We sat in water and I felt Amber's hand grab into mine as I was about to get into the water too. She looked at me and saw the look on my face and kissed me gently.</p> <p>"There now, don't forget I'll have to go change so we can swim!" she said, as she quickly finished her drink.</p> <p>I watched her slide to the bottom of the pool again, and Amber's robe slid off her shoulders and she started to float, looking around the shallow part for anything to catch her. I watched, knowing that something else had to happen, but wanted to know what.</p> <p>I was a little surprised when her robe slipped off, and I was completely naked when she returned. She took a towel out of the bathroom and dried off, then got in again, this time leaning over to kiss me again.</p> <p>"Sorry about that last time, I'll make up for it later." Amber said as she slid to the bottom of the pool, still clinging to me.</p> <p>"You can't make up for it, I'll make it up for all of us." I told her as we swam around, trying to find what would happen next. The cold water of the pool was really relaxing as we were floating.</p> <p>The sun was up as the two of us floated and talked, talking and telling each other all the things we both were discovering. I wanted to make another for her, so we turned around to look at the lake. It looked inviting, so we pulled into it and we walked out.</p> <p>We walked down the rocky path to her house, and when we were out of sight of the water, she called out to me to come out. I walked around, getting up again, holding on to her.</p> <p>"I'm going to sit here, if you want to." she said as she went to the couch and sat down. "Can you take a seat by the fire?"</p> <p>I sat down next to her. "There really isn't a fire in the house." I told her.</p> <p>"Well, at least it isn't burning up." she said with a smile. "I've come all this way to have some company for the next couple of days. You can take a seat by the fire, if you like."</p> <p>I knew she meant it as she pulled my head right into her soft mouth. Her hands came up to hold my head against her lips when she finally released me and started kissing up to my neck. I wanted to say something, but something came up; she kissed up to my ear, letting her hands travel around my back.</p> <p>"I want to show my appreciation in a way that we haven't done before, not in that way, you know?" she said as slid her hands over so she could rub and tickle my neck.</p> <p>"You haven't!" I asked, trying to get my breathing to return to normal, but it was completely out of control. I wanted to kiss her again, and feel her, but her words of praise were driving me wild. "I'm coming, too." I groaned as I came to a conclusion as she released her mouth and sat up.</p> <p>"Well, I want to show you what you will be missing and what you will have if you don't." she said as she sat back down.</p> <p>I was starting to catch what she had meant, and was about to tell her it was fine, but her actions before came crashing down, and I stopped.</p> <p>"I can't. I'm exhausted. Can I sit next to you awhile?
