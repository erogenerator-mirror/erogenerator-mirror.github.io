It had been a while. I was about to climax, but then, I began to hear noises. I couldn't make out anything, but I tried to tell someone, to tell them that I was coming. I couldn't, no, wait...</p> <p>"O..ow! Oh...uh...uh...uh...uh"</p> <p>It was almost too short. I was coming, too.</p> <p>It felt like a million years! It seemed like a very long time to me...</p> <p>Then, I felt something, something warm...I could barely describe it, and I was feeling it go down...</p> <p>It was a hot tongue...I was going to come again, as it started to move back up and then went down and up...in fast circles...I felt a warm tongue on my clit...</p> <p>I knew it was right there, but I couldn't feel it...this was wrong! I couldn't cum like this! I needed to stop it!</p> <p>I was having feelings of panic and fear that it would never happen. I was being denied orgasm!</p> <p>What happened to me wasn't real, and for what? My orgasm...it felt...</p> <p>I didn't know it, but all I thought about, was the fact that it would never happen.</p> <p>Then, as the last of my climax left me, I heard myself whispering "I'm going to come!"</p> <p>I couldn't believe it! I was going to climax! I thought I would have had to have my body convulsing with pleasure, but I wasn't.</p> <p>I was panting and moaning in a way that wasn't even my own...I started to move again, but then, I collapsed on the bed. I was totally spent, not moving from all the feeling of my climax. My body was shaking with aftershocks and waves of pleasure.</p> <p>As my orgasm began to subside, I felt soft hands rubbing all over me...the sensation of a warm body lying next to me, and I knew that the warmth of it felt good. I felt hands everywhere...and in a moment of clarity, I knew that I would have felt good at any age...</p> <p>I moved to get up, but the hands were still touching me, on my body. I started to pull away, but then the hands were still on me, and it all seemed to go on and on--the feeling of the hands in me...and...</p> <p>I felt something on my thighs, but it made no difference...the feeling was familiar. In fact, I felt like I wanted to come again right then. My body still felt...strange. Then, it touched me again...like it did every time I climaxed, though this time, I knew it was different...</p> <p>"Oh my god, that was amazing!" I heard myself say, and it seemed like only seconds, I think.</p> <p>My body collapsed onto the bed, and I could hear it rumble again.</p> <p>And again...and again...it seemed like...the next moment.....and on......</p> <p>I couldn't move and I couldn't speak. I was breathing, but I couldn't speak. And then it faded. I was completely at the mercy of this stranger. Just like when I first saw him, I wasn't dreaming.</p> <p>But...he didn't say a word. I could have said something. Just say it to save my life. To try to save myself! But...I can't!</p> <p>I couldn't move. Even my arms were shaking as if I had been thrown off by a freight train. I had no strength in me! I was completely helpless. I couldn't fight! I was helpless, I couldn't stand a chance!</p> <p>This stranger then slowly began to climb up my bed. I lay there, and then, he sat down in front of me. I was still on my back, and he was standing by my bed. I could feel his body pressed against mine, and I couldn't move. I closed my eyes and felt his arms around me, and I could hear him breathing in my ear and his hand rubbing my skin. He had touched me like I didn't want to be touched again!</p> <p>He seemed to be so comfortable that I decided to try to get up.</p> <p>"Wait," I whispered.</p> <p>"Okay..." he said, softly. "I'll go back to sleep."</p> <p>I couldn't find it any easier to stand up. Just as I turned around to get up and go to the bathroom, I could hear something else, too. It sounded like him and some other man. Then, I turned back around and tried to get back up.</p> <p>"Wait!" I said again. "You said you wanted to come again! Wait! Can I...Can I have another?"</p> <p>He didn't reply to meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
