It's not like he doesn't get it and he certainly doesn't say it is.</p> <p>A man will always go on and on about his sex life.</p> <p>If he says it is a pity and needs something to change he knows the answer."</p> <p>I said no.</p> <p>"So you're saying if it was a pity, would you consider it?"</p> <p>I hesitated.</p> <p>"I would say a pity I would want to change into a man. But after a number of months he still says he would want to change if only you knew. So if nothing you really think it wouldn't bother you. After a month he is ready to change. He is still waiting to change, he says it will never happen."</p> <p>"You've just never found someone."</p> <p>"That's why I asked you out. To tell you he was not as happy with an answer as he was being with the answer to a question."</p> <p>"So you don't expect him to change?"</p> <p>"No and probably never will. But I don't know why. I don't trust him for the same reason you probably don't trust him for either."</p> <p>I stopped myself thinking about the answer and decided not to ask. The only thing to do was to go for it.</p> <p>"Why don't you start with you and see what works for you."</p> <p>I put my drink down, walked to him and said,</p> <p>"Well I have known for a long time that it is a bad thing to be in love with the person you are not, but I always felt that was the right thing to do. I didn't love you the way you felt about me. I didn't love you like I meant to, I just wanted to say I wasn't happy. I don't blame you for not saying thank you. If I hadn't said thank I would have said you're great and I would be happier."</p> <p>He was smiling, he stood up and we took his money.</p> <p>"What if I could have bought you a ring right now, just like I asked, and you know that would be the perfect ring."</p> <p>"Of course I would, let's see what happens."</p> <p>After his money, we went into the bedroom and undressed. He went to the bedroom and removed his pants and shirt. He was naked as I was. I stared at how beautiful he was. He made no moves. I was mesmerized by his body.</p> <p>'Did I ever ask you how young you are? Did I ever ask you what age? Did I ever tell you of your interest in sex?"</p> <p>I was in love with his body, even though I couldn't admit it. He asked me about myself and how I was. I told him about my past and when I left the military I had been discharged several years before. I told him that I had no real life experience and that I had no desire to be like it. I told him that I had just left the Army myself.</p> <p>He sat in a chair and had me get on my knees and took a condom out of his pocket. I put it to his shaft and could see how much it was. I licked it, kissed it, and took it in my mouth. I worked his head with my hand and he was stroking my hair. The pleasure was immense and his head was moving against my lips, my tongue, and my throat.</p> <p>I had to be careful not to let any of him get behind my gag reflex. I wanted him in me. I wanted to feel his cum.</p> <p>"Now, I want to feel what I did to you."</p> <p>He sat back on the bed. I knelt, took his cock and put it to my mouth, got in my mouth and went down on him. As I was sucking his cock, my eyes were closed and I could see his hand stroking on his cock.</p> <p>His eyes were like silver, I could imagine he was being hypnotized for the next hour.</p> <p>I loved how he was hypnotizing me, every time he was going down on me, his eyes were following mine the whole way, and as we arrived at the bed I noticed a wet spot.</p> <p>We must have fucked for a few minutes and then I came up for air, saw a wet spot on the bed next to us and saw his body move to look for the wet spot.</p> <p>He moved off the bed and walked naked on his hands and knees back toward us.</p> <p>"Come here."</p> <p>"Come here."</p> <p>I sat back on my heels and he came and stood over me looking between my legs. He rubbed his cock on my pussy lips and my mouth.</p> <p>"Come here, come here."</p> <p>I looked at him andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
