But I think I should have known better." She said. "Don't go giving me reason to think I was wrong. I just wanted to say you're an angel. I think some people need a hug."</p> <p>"Thanks... You're so sweet. I'm in your arms in just moments." She said. She kissed me lovingly, "I'll call you when I'm ready."</p> <p>"I have one other little thing I'd like to do with you before we leave - it's very personal." I said. I knew I was going to like her.</p> <p>We hugged again and I gave her a kiss on the cheek and she hugged me back, then we broke apart.</p> <p>"Thanks. That was nice." She said.</p> <p>I was about to say, "You're not trying to kiss me." But I stopped myself. What had she been thinking I was? That I wasn't in love with her? She hugged me and kissed my cheek, then she said, "I love you. Now go on and go. We'll talk tomorrow."</p> <p>I was speechless but smiled when I knew she really meant what she said. I went and got breakfast. It wasn't much but it served her purpose very well.</p> <p>We ate a little at the breakfast table, then were having dessert.</p> <p>When we were finished, I pulled her into my arms, "I never get enough." I said.</p> <p>"I know, I know." She replied.</p> <p>"What about this little thing we talked about?" I asked.</p> <p>"You know what I mean. I don't think I could ever be this comfortable with anyone." She said. I started pulling on her clothes and she quickly pulled them away. She had on a pair of low rise jeans. She was wearing white cotton panties, which covered her mound. I took off her panties and she said, "Can you stay and take off my top?" At first I was disappointed but then I realized it wasn't a bad thing. She had an amazing body. When she was in a better mood, she was a very sweetheart. But at that moment, I'm not sure I wanted to share her with anyone.</p> <p>She pulled me down and kissed me, "You go get some lotion and we'll start getting comfortable, then I'll get my top off."</p> <p>I walked back to her and did her top, she reached over and grabbed my erection, then rubbed it all over her breasts. "You better get some lotion on me - I don't want you to go mad." She said.</p> <p>I put some lotion on my hand, and ran my hand over her right shoulder. I put my hand down the front of her jeans. "I thought we were going to talk tomorrow about the trip. Why didn't you call me?" I asked.</p> <p>Lisa said, "It was just going to wait for another day. I'm still thinking about the fact there was another young man out on his boat and we needed to talk about it."</p> <p>"It wasn't like this is anything like what I wanted." I smiled.</p> <p>She kissed me and continued, "What I meant was that we had had a chance to talk about the trip. But if I did this, then I would have gotten another chance too."</p> <p>"That's great. I'm still thinking about things now." I said.</p> <p>"You know that I'm not a saint but, I want you to do this for me and only you."</p> <p>I started putting on my shorts, she said, "You're the one that came to me and you don't have to worry about anything. If anything happens, just give me a moment. I'll be out of you in ten minutes."</p> <p>"Goodnight." I said then left her to finish getting dressed.</p> <p>I walked her to her car and she got in the passenger seat. I got in behind her and she said, "Thanks for coming. We haven't had so much time to talk, and I don't plan on this to happen again."</p> <p>"No problem." I smiled.</p> <p>She had a sad look on her face and drove down to the beach. We left her car and walked to the car. I opened it and got in, we stopped at the entrance and she opened the door and got in.</p> <p>"I'm sorry." She said.</p> <p>I grabbed her hand and said, "No, no, don't be. It wouldn't be anything like this, it's okay. It's just us talking."</p> <p>She put her hand in mine and said, "Okay. I'll talk." Then she leaned over and kissed me.</p> <p>"Thank you." She said.
