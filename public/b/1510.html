"If it turns you on so much when you play around with one's hand, why don't you get it yourself, too, then, dear?"</p> <p>The young man looked up at his wife with a strange expression. He looked concerned that she'd suddenly gotten so excited.</p> <p>"I'd like you to take a shower, so you can join me."</p> <p>He agreed quickly and after a momentous decision, they began walking. As they crossed the courtyard, he looked over at me. "Do you mind?"</p> <p>"No, no."</p> <p>After a brief pause, my wife said, "I want to get in the shower now, dear."</p> <p>"Don't wait up," I said, and as we stepped into the shower, we faced each other.</p> <p>Once my wife was dry and I was starting to dry her hair so I could finish getting into the shower, I turned on the shower to hot and started to wash myself.</p> <p>She watched me as I soaped my erection. "You know, I always knew you had an exhibitionist streak, but didn't know it back then," my wife said.</p> <p>"But, it didn't bother me," I replied. "And I'll bet it turned you on. Do you think we'll have any problem?"</p> <p>"No, not really. In fact, if you want to do it again, we won't know."</p> <p>My wife reached out and ran her hands over my erection. "I'm excited." She began to stroke me off, then looked over at me. "Go ahead, dear," she said. "Finish your shower. I'll watch you get dressed."</p> <p>"You're sure, my dear?" My wife asked, surprised.</p> <p>"Positive!" I agreed, soaping myself. "It's probably only a minute, and I'll be fine to do it." I washed off quickly and stepped out of the shower, my wife's eyes following the motion of my erection. "I've got to run to have the check-in tomorrow," my wife said to me. "Make sure the guys will be here."</p> <p>We both stepped out of the shower and toweled dry, then dried quickly, slipping on our clothes. I put the shoes on and headed outside.</p> <p>There was a sign up front by the security camera. They were about fifteen miles away, and with an automatic security camera, they would easily spot me, and the security camera would record me changing to go homeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
