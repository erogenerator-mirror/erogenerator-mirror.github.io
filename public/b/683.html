She felt like a little girl once more. She was his now.</p> <p>His hand came suddenly upon her upper body, his eyes as he stared intently into hers as she continued to masturbate. It took her a moment to realize she was touching herself. Her fingers seemed to be moving at a slower pace, the wetness making her panties transparent and transparent, the wet fabric clinging to her body, her nipples making visible points through her tight top. It was very erotic.</p> <p>She was on fire!</p> <p>Her body felt flushed and quivering, every nerve ending alive, alive to his touch and his eyes. His voice was commanding now, not mocking to her as she had been and a new thrill ran through her like a wild animal.</p> <p>She felt it like that. Her cunt began to throb, her mind whirling with pleasure and the next second she knew, she came. She came hard, her knees buckled and she fell to the floor, her whole body shaking with excitement. She came for quite a while, a long moment without end.</p> <p>It lasted forever as she felt his breath upon her chest, his hand upon her, his tongue exploring her mouth, he had a hard manhood between her legs. She was sure he could feel her juices flowing down into her panties!</p> <p>"You are beautiful!" he said again, his lips brushing her cheek to his own. She felt his lips touching her again, his tongue licking her lower lip. She could feel the moistness, the heat of his kisses against her face and the soft, wet tongue exploring her mouth.</p> <p>She opened her mouth to him and her lips slid over his, their full moist lips sucking on each other. He felt her wetness against his manhood and his own. Their mouths opened and he entered her.</p> <p>Their tongues swirled into each other for several minutes. His manhood slowly slid into her wet opening a fraction then out again. She couldn't believe where she was at all now! It felt like heaven, like the first time she'd ever been laid! Was it real or had it been a dream? She closed her eyes, her hands gently caressed his shoulders, one reaching down from his chest to his buttocks, fingers sliding over the smooth skin. His lips were still upon hers, lips still hot on hers, his tongue sliding past hers. He could taste himself, his own breath, his cock sliding in and out of her pussy, his hand still against her face and she still held his penis.</p> <p>Her hands had no other choice but to caress him. She opened her eyes again and looked up at him. Her lips parted, her eyes moved up to look into his and he moved his mouth from hers. She felt a small wave of excitement course through her, like electric currents as their eyes met and the thrill she felt was all the way through her to her brain. She wanted more!</p> <p>His lips were back on hers again, his tongue inside her mouth exploring her, his hand still on her face and she moved her own finger to touch herself a few times in a while, watching him as she did so. She was amazed; she'd never felt anything like that.</p> <p>"You are so perfect!" he exclaimed, his mouth again touching hers. It was a dream at last, almost a new kind of bliss. She had no idea what would come next. What would happen next?</p> <p>"You taste so good, too." his lips teased hers, his hand slipping from her face to touch her breasts, a hand sliding around to begin at her breast. He squeezed a breast, his fingers gently pinching the nipple with a soft touch she liked.</p> <p>His hand moved downward, sliding over her tummy and across her smooth mound. There it was, on her. She knew she was wet. She was aroused. She was ready. His finger touched her clitoris as his mouth continued to kiss her, her legs still held wide, her hands resting on his shoulders. He slipped his finger inside, wet and wet. She moaned and began to come again as the hand on her breast was still stroking her pussy, her clit still hard and sensitive to the touch.</p> <p>She felt his finger slide over her lips, down and up across her lips. As his hand moved over her, she felt herself growing wet and aroused, her sex becoming wetter and warmer. She didn't know how she could feel good enough for him - how could she?</p> <p>Her nipples remained hard, taut against her chest. The whole sensation was coming back, like a dream. Her hand continued to stroke his cock and her head was back against the wall, eyes closed in ecstasy as his finger slid inside of her.
