She grabbed some paper plates with silverware, and set them on the floor. She made several motions with her hands with a fork and knife, and then used the knife to spread the plate on the floor. "You're a real beauty."</p> <p>"Thank you." He said, smiling. I guess I got you so much you're my knight in shining armor. There's a great deal I'd like to do with you, or maybe, even more."</p> <p>"I think we should go." Alex winked at Alex. Alex just said. "Don't be uncomfortable." And they reached the front door. He went ahead of her.</p> <p>As they walked, Alex stopped and turned to face her. He kissed her again. His hand went to her bare arm, caressing her soft skin. "Thank you again."</p> <p>"Are you sure, that you don't feel like you'd better go shower?" Alex said. He stood there, looking at her and grinning, before continuing. "I think you've earned a little time alone."</p> <p>"Why no, I definitely think so. We'll have a great time." Alex laughed, and they walked out to the driveway again. As Alex drove, he looked at her. He couldn't believe he had fallen for her. "I'm really in love with you."</p> <p>"As in you're in love? With someone else?" Alex asked, smiling.</p> <p>"Well yes. My ex is a lot like..."</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm sure he's a lot like you." Alex said, laughing.</p> <p>"You're kidding, right?"</p> <p>"Oh no, I was never kidding. I think you're beautiful." Alex said, before adding "I don't mean to sound like a pervert, but sometimes it freaks me out." Before he could say anything else, she turned to face him again.</p> <p>"So, I guess you won't mind if I take my clothes off?" Alex asked, grinning. Alex nodded and said nothing as he unbuttoned his shirt, letting it fall open. He pulled out his belt and tossed it on the ground, before pulling it out of his pants. He pulled out his belt and looped it around his waist. "You're taking your clothes off now, Alex." Alex took his hand and helped him off with the shirt. He tossed them to her where they hit.</p> <p>"Very nice, Alex. Now you can wear mine."</p> <p>"What? You're kidding, right?" Alex said, confused. "I don't mean to be presumptuous... It's..."</p> <p>"Yes, yes, I am joking. You see that's exactly my point." Alex said, smiling. He kicked off his shoes, socks and pants. He threw them on the ground. His shirt followed.</p> <p>"Nice underwear. You must have a lot of practice at this." Alex said, and she laughed. Alex's erection was straining at the material of his under shorts again. It was time.</p> <p>"I suppose we can try and find something else out to the shed before we come over?" Alex said, pointing to the side of the main house, and then they both ran off. Alex caught her breath a moment later as he reached out to grab her again. He kissed her on the lips once more. As they stepped into the back yard. Alex looked at himself for a moment, before dropping his jeans, and pulling his boxers off. He looked at Alex through his legs as he lay down on his back.</p> <p>She straddled him, and put his penis into her pussy. Then she started to move herself up and down on his member. "You do this so many times... Do you really like that?" Alex asked, looking into her eyes. She smiled and started again. Alex began to move up and down, enjoying the warmth of her body on him, before she pushed her whole body down. At first, his penis disappeared into her pussy, but as her arousal increased, she continued to move up and down. He could feel her hands on his stomach, her weight against him. He could do nothing to stop himself as his orgasm began. He moaned and shouted as he came inside her, as she moaned, as he collapsed under her.</p> <p>"That was beautiful. I haven't cum like that in ages." Alex said. "Now I need you." Alex said, crawling over him and taking his penis into his mouth. "Mmm, so salty and sweet." Alex commented between moans and licks.</p> <p>"Not much to tell. My dick tastes like vinegar, not a man." Alex said and laughed. Alex continued to suck him off as he played with her breasts. He continued to play with herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
