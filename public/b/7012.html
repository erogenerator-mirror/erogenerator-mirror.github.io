She knew every contour and contour of his cock inside of her. She watched the contours in his mind. Her body was the centre of his universe. It was like a moth being exposed. He could see what he wanted to see and what he wanted to see. As he watched she began to lift up herself again and then push back down. He could see every curve inside her as she thrust herself deeper into him and he could feel the sensation building in his cock as it pressed against the roof of her vagina. Her whole body was shaking as she approached the end of her cycle and he could feel her juices soaking into his shaft. He could now feel the contractions as she felt herself start to move even more towards her own orgasm. She cried out "Oh god I am going to cum baby" as her body shook almost violently. She rode him hard as she came, shuddering slightly as an electric sensation ran through her.</p> <p>He pulled out after she came and she collapsed, her legs wide open, and he could see her pussy cum running down the inside of her thighs. They had both orgasmed. He leaned back against the seat with his cock still inside her and she was in the middle of a passionate kiss. She could feel his cock pulsing inside of her and as he came she reached down to put his cock away. She turned and leaned against him, trying to make out a message. As he looked into her eyes again he could see the excitement; the excitement she was feeling. He wanted to fuck her so badly, but he felt he couldn't. He also felt she had a need. He wanted her, needing her in every way but feeling that she was right back in front of them. She put her arms through his and pulled him towards her. They were silent kissing for a moment.</p> <p>"Fuck me then." She said.</p> <p>"I am not really sure yet," he said, "I only knew you were pretty, in good shape."</p> <p>"Awww I am not really sure. I was expecting you to be in front of me today. I think you are amazing, don't you?"</p> <p>"Yes I do, I want you to be. But I don't want you going on about how hot you are."</p> <p>"What do you mean" she said as she put her hands on his chest, running her fingers over his firm chest. He reached around and cupped her breasts as she leaned against him. She could feel him harden with her breasts in his hands. "You will know when you need to. I like to be able to take control over you, you can do what you like," she murmured.</p> <p>"How do you want me?" he asked, looking into her eyes again, "Do you want me on top?"</p> <p>"I want you on top please" she said again, smiling as he sat her down again. He looked at her and she saw the excitement, the need, for control in his eyes. She reached down and held his cock towards her entrance then ran it inside her again as her legs were still open. She pushed out and he entered again, again and again. He wanted to be in her; wanted to fuck her. Her eyes widened and she gasped sharply. He felt his own need building again. He could feel it in her eyes as she kept her eyes closed, and he could feel himself as it was coming back to him and she was getting aching. She reached round a little and felt him again inside of her; this time without his cock, and she could feel the tension building inside. He was going to cum at any moment. There was only one thing he wanted to do. He needed her, wanted her to cum with him. He tried to picture her as he came within her. He wanted to see her cum with him. He wanted to feel her cum with him. He could feel himself as his body tensed. He could feel his cock pulse and throb as they were joined in their connection. He wanted to pull out and cum, but he could not as they were still connected in that way. He knew not to let her pull him back inside of her. This time he was close.</p> <p>"Fuck" he whispered, leaning back against the roof and looking straight at her. "I am gonna cum!" He said looking deep into her eyes as his body shook with her movements. He saw the pleasure, the excitement and the lust, in her eyes. "I am cumming" he said and felt his cum gush from him as it felt as if it was trying to get out of him and it felt the warm liquid inside his body; each jet was stronger than the last. He could feel the warmth of his body as his cum splashed and splashed into her.</p> <p>It made himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
