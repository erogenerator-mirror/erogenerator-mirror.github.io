He pulled his jacket off and grabbed his phone from his pocket.</p> <p>He grabbed the two towels from the locker room and threw them on a towel rack beside the bed. He wrapped the towel around his body and climbed out of bed and wrapped up the towel. He grabbed a pair of boxers from the laundry hamper and left the room naked. He put on a pair of gym shorts and walked out of the house.</p> <p>"Hey baby, I'm going to grab my stuff and get into the shower. Just stay under one of the stucco showerheads and let's have a good time," He called out to her from the bathroom.</p> <p>"Of course," She replied as she opened the bathroom door and walked around it.</p> <p>He turned on the water and stepped in. It was a gorgeous morning out. The sun had the blue sky and a hint of green on the tops. Today, the temperature had dropped and a cool breeze wafted around the showerhead. He could smell the sweet scent of the sea and his cock got even harder than it already was. The last thing he needed was for his baby's mother to come back in and wonder what he was doing in the house without his consent.</p> <p>"Are we going to go swimming today?" He asked out of boredom.</p> <p>"I'm going to take some time off from work and meet the guys out here in the hot tub at the waterfall," She replied.</p> <p>He looked up from the phone and saw that the house was a mess from all the activity last night. There were piles of clothes everywhere, the floor, the bed, and even the bathroom. He pulled his phone out of his jacket and found the app for his phone. He typed in 'get out of bed.'</p> <p>"Okay I guess I'm going to head out early," He replied.</p> <p>He walked nude and out into the cool air of the pool, and headed to the bar. He sat at the bar down at the patio table and ordered a couple of cold beers. He was enjoying the sun on his sweaty face. As he was drinking down the beers his dick, already semi hard and pointing up, was pointing the way. He didn't know how many times he had masturbated this morning thinking of the two of them together.</p> <p>"So are you ready for some girl/girl/suck?"</p> <p>She turned to face him. "Yeah."</p> <p>She put her arms around him and rested her head on his shoulder. "I have been feeling horny ever since we last spoke," She whispered.</p> <p>"I know honey. But I love you so much and it's just going to have to wait a bit longer."</p> <p>"Okay," She replied.</p> <p>She moved closer and rubbed his cheek with her fingertips. "You're just so irresistible," She whispered.</p> <p>She leaned down and kissed his lips. He tasted like alcohol and a hint of chlorine. He could hear her taking deep breaths and felt her breasts heave as she fell on top of him. Their lips found each other and their two tongues dueled as his dick was being rubbed up against her. He let out a soft moan as she lifted her mouth from his and kissed his chin, then to the edge of his lips. She then lifted off him and stood up. "Let's go eat," She said with a smile.</p> <p>She gathered her gear and walked in front of him into the kitchen area. "Have a seat," She said as she sat down on the floor with her ass level with his face. She took his hand and put it on her ass, then brought his hand up to her pussy. He started feeling her through her panties. She leaned over and kissed him again.</p> <p>His mouth found her and their tongues danced. His hand found her pussy and began to rub in small motions. As they continued their kisses he felt her move to straddle him. His fingers found the hard cock of her pussy.</p> <p>"I want to taste you," She said as she pulled his hand out of her panties. He put one of her legs on either side of his. She put his head to her crotch and let him kiss the lips before sliding down to the other side. He felt her lips and clit as he felt her slide down. As he slid down, he felt his dick slide up to her pussy and rub against it. "I love how your dick feels," She said as she placed a hand on the back of his head and guided his mouth back and down.</p> <p>As he was sucking her clit and playing with it, she was sliding into high gear. He found her g spot and began to lick and lap at it as her hips fucked his tongue.
