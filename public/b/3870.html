Then she realized she was completely naked and had lost all trace of her clothes. She pulled her hands back again and tried to cover herself further but it was no use, only the coolness of the leather kept her nipples from becoming erect.</p> <p>There was no way out of this, nothing to do but lie down once again. It was a dream come true; she didn't have to get up at that time, she could just close her eyes and drift off. She knew it must be dark by now, and even if it wasn't there, she realized that she didn't care at that moment. She lay back on the cold leather, feeling more vulnerable and more vulnerable. She was in her own personal hell hole, and she didn't care. She was in control now, and it was all the more embarrassing that she didn't even feel the cold leather anymore. She would just lie there quietly, waiting patiently for the inevitable. She mustn't move...not until he arrived.</p> <p>As the minutes ticked by, she realized that they would arrive soon, and that for a while the only things that would be normal were the heat and the sounds of his motorcycle. She had no idea how long they would be gone. She kept trying to remember her dream, but there was no one around for miles. She lay there and listened to him breathe for a few moments, then finally she reached out and pulled him close to her. She was breathing heavy and he kissed her softly on the cheek, then she grabbed his hand and pulled him up towards her, never taking her eyes off his face. She kissed his nose and finally he smiled as she pushed his face in between her breasts, pulling him closer and letting his tongue lick her nipple.</p> <p>He didn't need to be told to keep going, for he moaned a little and she smiled, sucking the nub of flesh between her teeth. He moaned and rolled his tongue all over her, taking her hard nipple into his mouth and sucking gently. She held his head as he slid his hands up to her breasts, rubbing them together. He kept nipping, sucking on her nipples, and she moaned louder and louder. He knew it wouldn't be long as she lifted her breast as high as she could without leaving his mouth, the weight only helping to hold him tight against her. His hands still playing up and down her breasts, kneading and squeezing, pulling her nipples further into his mouth. She squirmed, begging him to just keep going, all the while feeling the pressure building inside her, building until finally she couldn't take it anymore. She came, and he came, and the next thing she knew they lay on the ground together, kissing in the darkness, his hand on her stomach pressing against her softly.</p> <p>"Wake up," she said.</p> <p>"Mmmpphhh," he mumbled, "I'm sorry I got you into such a lot of trouble, please forgive me for being a complete dick and wanting this."</p> <p>She grinned at him "Not that we are being a dick, but you better not have gotten yourself into any trouble, my love."</p> <p>"Hush! I don't want to have trouble, and besides, I'm not a dud." They looked at each other for long moments and he started laughing, his eyes going blue and his face turning red. "I just gotta be careful and not take things any further than we have been apart and it's only been a few hours."</p> <p>She felt herself blush and laughed even harder. She pulled him closer, and they just lay there, quietly talking for a time. He was starting to get hard again and he felt himself slipping along the warm leather of her thigh, so he pushed her leg up so he could slide his dick up and down her pussy. She was dripping wet just from lying there, almost begging for it to penetrate her. She reached down and rubbed him a little, before rolling him on to his back and straddling his chest, her pussy just hovering inches above it. She slowly slid herself down on to him. His dick just touched her and she smiled, still not moving, and he just moaned his approval, his dick sliding against the heat of her and she leaned forward a little pressing her hips into him, forcing him to part her lips with him slowly. She smiled once again, and rolled her hips a little, letting her clit slide over his dick a little as she went down.</p> <p>She slowly slid his dick into her while he wrapped his arms around her. She pushed him on to his back and straddled him, letting him slide back up her until she was sitting on him, a little on his leg, and then she pulled back and started grinding again, riding him slowly at first, and then faster and faster. She reached down to grab his ass, and slid him against her clit while she rode himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
