The movie was about a man trying to win a bet, so I decided to go in. It was a good movie even though only half of it had sex. I peeked my head out into the hallway to see who it was at the other end of the hallway. A man was peering down the hall with a flashlight. Not the flashlight, but the silhouette I had seen on the hall mirror. I turned away, not wanting to break his gaze, and walked into the guest room. The room itself had a big mirror mounted against one wall. A man was standing on the bed, stroking a thickly erect penis. I walked over to the bed and sat down, not really caring at this point. My heart pounded in my chest as I realized that I was being watched. I knew I should be going, but I felt compelled to go in, but I just wanted to be there. I sat there just looking at this man, as he stroked himself. I couldn't move. I was mesmerized by the way he was taking his dick in and out of the opening of his pants. I kept watching through the mirror so as not to be obvious, then I saw him put his hand inside the waistband of his pants and pull it out, showing me his penis. He was stroking it, and moaning at the sight. I stared and watched for a minute before opening my eyes in embarrassment of my naked body in front of the mirror, and wishing that I did this now. I reached to touch him, but found that he was still sitting still. I reached down and grabbed his penis in my hand and gave the head small rubs. He still didn't cum. I continued watching him stroking himself and watched as he looked down at the mirror, watching as he watched the reflection of my hand slowly rubbing myself to orgasm. A part of me wanted him to cum right there. A part of me wished that I had given him what he wanted. But I just didn't. He let out a sigh and a grunt of pleasure, then continued stroking himself, and I saw that he had been on the bed at the same time as me. I knew what he had been watching, but I was too embarrassed to find out what he had been doing. We finished our movie in silence until I said I was tired, and he said he was too, but he got up. He left the room and I could not move. He walked down the hall just then. I heard voices, and my heart broke into another pounding as I heard him approach the door and yell, "come in."</p> <p>I was dumbfounded that he was going to do that. This was one guy whom I had to be very careful to be discreet about. I was wondering what to do. Then I remembered that he knew my address, so I walked inside. He closed the door and locked it, then turned to face me, a look on his face that said "look at me, you slut!" He looked me right in the eyes, then went to a corner of his room and sat down. He crossed his legs and looked at me for a moment, then continued his silent and intense stare. I was confused, but then I realized that something in his eyes was sexual. I had seen his hard dick once, and I wanted to be with him. I wanted to suck this man's dick. I wanted to suck one of his dicks on my hands (which I was so very grateful to him for). He was still looking me right in the eye, and looked like he wanted me to suck his dick. I sat there and just stared into his blue eyes, and I just wanted to take his dick in my mouth. It was a deep look, and I wanted to take it all in. I wanted to taste the salty precum of his cock, wanting to taste its taste on my tongue. As I looked at him, I saw that he looked at the mirror too, and had a sort of mischievous expression on his face. I was stunned. I was frozen in mid-thought.</p> <p>I was frozen in my shock that just made me want him more than I have wanted a man in a very long time. But I was also getting turned on. I was just getting started. His stare was looking into my eyes the whole time, and I didn't want him to know what I had already gone through in my head. I was still looking into his eyes when he leaned forward and began to kiss me.</p> <p>I was taken by surprise at first, and his kiss wasn't what I expected. I guess it is kind of erotic, and it felt nice to be kissed by him. He kissed me so gently, and I felt at ease with him at least for the moment. After our first kiss, he said "hold onto me."
