I want you to come up with some good news for me and give me a bit of direction." she said giving her husband a hug. "I'm afraid I made some mistakes, but I think this is for the best. I hope you have a good time..."</p> <p>Sitting there, he said "Yes. I have a much better understanding. My wife has made her decision but I don't know if she is aware she has an emotional attachment that she is trying to hide. I understand. Let me go get some clean air and water for now."</p> <p>"No, you wait here. I'll be right back." She said going up the stairs quickly.</p> <p>Sitting on the bed he got out some pillows and a blanket and sat down next to his wife. He turned on some music on the stereo but it didn't start, so he turned his head and watched for a minute as the sound of her walking towards him, the sound of her heavy breathing and the movement of her arms brought him up to his senses. "Are you sure you want to do this? I mean you are my husband, but don't worry, I'm sure I can handle this."</p> <p>"Well..." she paused and looked at him closely, "I'm sure I can handle this. In fact, if this feels as bad as this feels, I might start to doubt a lot of the wisdom of my marriage. But, I really mean this. I haven't been with a man in over six months and I'm sure you know what I mean, don't you?" She smiled at him.</p> <p>Trying not to break his confidence in her, he said "I know what I'm talking about. I haven't fucked a woman in a long time. No, that's not true. I haven't screwed someone in two months either. But, I guess if this is what you want, lets go ahead."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sure you want to know. I don't want to keep you waiting. I've been on the pill for about three years, so my body is pretty good. And, I really want to do something with you. I'll try to be very careful. Okay?"</p> <p>In his excitement he was about to add things, but he couldn't seem to pull it off. "Yeah, okay I guess."</p> <p>"Good. Well, let's get started. I'm starved so I want you to show me something that I've never seen before." she said while standing there in her bedroom, which was large, very luxurious room. She was wearing a black gown, which was open to her naval, and black boots. She also wore matching robe around her shoulders.</p> <p>"Okay." he said, "I think we should eat and I'll see what I can do. Is that okay?"</p> <p>"Yeah, like I didn't forget. Yeah, well it's so good that I can't wear a bra for much longer. I haven't made it easy to get a hold of one since I got ahold of my husband." she paused and looked at him with those big smile again. "Now, we're going to have some fun. I'm going to undress you. You will find out how a real man undresses a woman. Do yourself a favor and put some clothes on. I won't take any pain. I think if I get naked quickly, I might feel bad and I'll end up in some serious trouble. And, there won't be any marks, so there is no way to get caught. Just get comfortable."</p> <p>"Sure, go ahead." he said nervously. He could see in his rear view mirror she was removing her robe, which was opening just a bit and showing some cleavage. And her breasts came out very nicely, showing them off in all their beauty. She took off her bra and put on a gown like that with a slit up one side. It came to about mid thigh and had a long neckline, which showed her breasts plenty.</p> <p>"Here, I can't wear panties like when I was in the shower, but I'm going to take off the robe just to make sure it is comfortable. I can't put it away, so be careful. But, you can use the lotion if you like."</p> <p>"Uh, okay. I guess..." he hesitated, then said, "Yeah it could be fun. But, you know, it would be very embarrassing if I was wearing panties."</p> <p>She stepped up on her toes and kissed him on the lips. "It will be fun just the same as getting my way. Don't worry, but if you feel uncomfortable too much, just let me know. If you feel shy, just call a little girl voice and I'll make you feel normal. I promise. Okay?"</p> <p>He felt very uncomfortable but he saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
