He pulled his shorts down, revealing his rock hard cock and balls.</p> <p>"You can be my toy now."</p> <p>"But, my hands still handcuffed together..."</p> <p>"Yes, yes"</p> <p>He grabbed the chain running up the inside of his left leg and pulled. When he had the chain he pulled it out and let go of his wrist. He attached the chain to a hook behind his leg with a cable and pulled again, looping the cable into a hook below his leg.</p> <p>Once he finished this he pulled his shorts off and handed the chain to me. I attached it to the hook behind my leg and pulled it out and let go of the ring in my back. He grabbed my cock and jerked it for me. I let go of the ring and moved to the other side of the bed. I pulled the hook over my foot and watched him as he jerked my cock.</p> <p>"Now, just stay like that and watch."</p> <p>I laid back on the bed, my right leg on the floor, my left leg leaning back against the footboard beside me. He jerked my cock, squeezing the ring that ran up the shaft and pulled it down into my ass. I was moaning and shaking now.</p> <p>He pulled a small key out of his pocket and slipped the key into the ring on my left ankle. He put the key in his pocket and picked up my right ankle.</p> <p>"Turn over. Now your hands and feet are still at the head of the bed."</p> <p>He reached under my legs and grabbed the chain, pulling it down, past my balls and onto my feet. He picked up the chain and wrapped it around my thigh and wrapped it so tight it didn't move. He ran the chain up and down my cock and balls.</p> <p>He pulled the chain tight against my balls, lifting me off the bed.</p> <p>"Now what's in that bag?"</p> <p>"Don't worry about it. You have to tell me when you're about to cum. You can do whatever it is you want to do."</p> <p>"Will you do this for me? Please?"</p> <p>"I'll be honest with you. There will be times when you're not going to be able to hold out much longer."</p> <p>"Promise?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>He stood up and took a step toward me. "I'll come back."</p> <p>"No, please don't!" I protested as he started unzipping his pants again.</p> <p>When he got the last button he pulled back and looked down at me standing in front of him naked except for his socks and shoes.</p> <p>"No. Just wait."</p> <p>He pulled his pants off and pushed them down so my cock was exposed. "Now, now. I don't want to hurt you or make you uncomfortable."</p> <p>He stepped toward me, wrapping the chain in his left hand, and wrapped his right around my left ankle. He reached his hand behind and pulled the chain down, pushing my other leg up to my chest. He took the chain and ran it under my balls and up my cock and let go.</p> <p>"Now, let's see if that will do it." He stood back up and wrapped the chain back around his wrist. He wrapped the chain around my collar and pulled it tight. He stepped back and held open the chain. He stood back up, and took the chain from his left hand with his right and pulled it in and made a loop on it. Once he looped the chain he reached to my ankles and wrapped my left ankle in his right hand. He put the right hand on my balls and ran it up the length of my cock and balls and back down.</p> <p>He stepped back and stared at my naked, restrained body. "Are you sure you want this? You don't have to."</p> <p>"Yes. Really. I'll let you have my mouth or my ass."</p> <p>"Can I ask you something else, please?"</p> <p>"Of course. If you like."</p> <p>He ran his fingers down my face and hair, making me shiver. "Please. Now?"</p> <p>I nodded and he stepped back, pulling the chain so the chain and chain held mine in a ring between his hands. "You know, I think it would be easier if you told me to take off the collar"</p> <p>"You could if you don't mind. I never took it off."</p> <p>"Not when I was in New York?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"I don't mind if you don't mind, I'll let you ask me anything."</p> <p>"Oh, I think I'd appreciate that. But, please? Take off my collar."</p> <p>He pulled the chain tight on the leash and pulled the chain up my backside. "Very good.
