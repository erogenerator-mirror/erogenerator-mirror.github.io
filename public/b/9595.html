I was hoping he wouldn’t notice that I was sobbing.</p> <p>As he laid his hand on my back I could feel my husband’s warm breath on my neck.</p> <p>It was getting late in the day but I was too nervous to do anything about it. His hand slid down again and I felt him squeeze my bottom.</p> <p>The next thing I felt was his hand gently kneading my ass. His fingers traced up my crack and down to my cleft.</p> <p>“No!” was all I could think of to say as I squeezed him.</p> <p>I turned away from him and bent over the arm of our blanket and rested my head against him. He was slowly stroking my hair the whole time. Then he pulled my arms up and I felt the towel go and he quickly pulled it across my shoulders just as I leaned over.</p> <p>“Well, good for you”, he said.</p> <p>He gently kissed my neck and I could feel myself falling asleep.</p> <p>The next day I woke first, as it was light out and I began to get a little scared.</p> <p>It was dark, even early in the morning. I looked at my cell phone and saw it said 11:02 PM.</p> <p>That was a good sign. My husband had been kind of busy this morning too. That was surprising. My husband always had been so sweet and loving.</p> <p>I glanced around my room and there in the top dresser drawer there was what looked like a box I couldn’t get ahold of until I found it. I peeked inside and it was a pair of black bikini panties. I thought it was going to be a problem, as the panties were so skimpy, and if I got caught in the closet. I then went over to my closet and pulled up another pair of panties, and as I was pulling them on the thin material just about fell off the top. I pulled one leg in the other then put my fingers inside the elastic and pulled the fabric down the back of the panties as I pushed them over the elastic waistband. I took the panties up to the mirror and looked at me. They were so tiny the fabric came almost to my knees and there were no tell-tale tinges showing.</p> <p>“What the hell is this,” I thought.</p> <p>My husband was out of town on business that day, so I decided to leave the panties on the bed then go back to my room.</p> <p>“What are those again?” I stammered.</p> <p>“Yes,” his voice came.</p> <p>I knew he was standing there looking at my panties but it sent a thrill through me.</p> <p>I took off the panties and lay my robe on the side of the bed. I grabbed a pair of my panties with the top and threw them on the bed. I then picked up the panties that held the yellow ones and as the panties were soaked from the moisture in the crotch of them; they had wet spots that were easily visible if I looked closely.</p> <p>“Are they ok”, he asked curiously.</p> <p>I shrugged my shoulders, took a deep breath and said, “Yes”</p> <p>“Did I do something wrong?”, he asked.</p> <p>“No, it was great.
