We could do a lot together," I spoke to her.</p> <p>"Yes," she responded, "now that you're here I'm feeling quite happy. I really do have to do this. It's been so long."</p> <p>To her complete surprise I began to feel very, very horny, which she found to be an advantage in the situation. I was a bit worried that she would actually do this. A man might just look for the sexual excitement of a sexy woman like her, he'd be more likely to get aroused. She was obviously feeling no such inclinations. As soon as I mentioned the sexual excitement of the situation I was able to come up with a reasonable reasoning to help alleviate the problem. It was a small consolation I suppose.</p> <p>She looked down at me as if there wouldn't be any more sexual excitement to deal with anyway. "Now I really would feel awkward having sex with you, but I trust you," she asserted.</p> <p>I smiled at her and replied, "I can assure you that I'm not the one putting you through that." With that I dropped my pants and boxer shorts to the floor and we were again standing naked but for our shoes. We embraced and began to rub against each other as we began to caress each other in earnest. We kissed passionately while our naked bodies moved against each other. We could feel the pressure building as our bodies approached the climax point. We broke away.</p> <p>"No," she demanded as she stood at the foot of the bed and then she stopped me. She reached down and helped me up onto the bed.</p> <p>"Now you, as well as your clothes. You should return the favor," she commanded me.</p> <p>I was completely naked as I sat on the bed and she dropped to her knees and began to suck first on her left nipple, before she proceeded to do the same on her right one. As I looked on with amazement my wife's hands were soon stroking my prick. She was expertly stroking it, which felt very good to me. When her lips wrapped around the head of my penis her tongue did a very good job at coating it and moving smoothly along it.</p> <p>"Now, we are going to be more open and honest with each other. Do you understand?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes, very much," I replied.</p> <p>"Good. Now get off the bed and come over to me."</p> <p>I got off the bed and walked over to my naked wife.</p> <p>"Turn around," she commanded.</p> <p>I turned around and she reached under the bed and released her breasts from their confinement. They looked as magnificent as ever and they had just gotten fuller. I could tell she hadn't ever done this before when she was so close and close. As I approached her she leaned forward and planted her mouth on mine and we began to kiss deeply. At the same time we could feel our own penis rub against each others bodies. We both began to rock against ourselves through the whole thing where we rubbed and caressed each other.</p> <p>As my wife continued to kiss me my penis slid up and down against her wet pussy. I thought I was going to ejaculate right then because the feeling that we now were each experiencing seemed so different than our earlier experience. Our penis slid up and down against the soft, wet folds of my wife's sex. I couldn't believe it when my penis began to stiffen and grow in her mouth while it rubbed up and down over her tongue.</p> <p>"Now, you may have to take your hand and gently play with my breasts. That should please me," hesed in my ear.</p> <p>"Of course. How can you tell to do that," I panted as I stroked his cock. "That's why I liked to ask. Here."</p> <p>My wife's mouth quickly replaced mine as she moved her hands to my breasts, which were very firm and sensitive. She took one tit into her large hand and began to rub it gently. I had begun to feel extremely horny and aroused by what we were doing. I wanted to be able to fuck her immediately but I had other things on my mind. I began to rock back and forth as my wife continued to squeeze my nipples. Her hand was now moving with great purpose, but I was too close to the point of no return.</p> <p>My wife pulled the tit from her hand, sucked my nipple into her mouth, and began to rapidly flutter her tongue over it. "Please, I want you to fuck me!" she suddenly screamed out.</p> <p>"Very good, dear," I replied as I leaned back from her and took in her appearance. She was now very wet. It looked very sexy, she was flushed to almost blushing from head to her waist. She was totally naked. Her breasts and nipples were pink and swollen. Her pussy was perfectly shaved. Her inner thighs wereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
