That's too much to ask of you," she said, and that didn't seem to be much consolation.</p> <p>"Maybe you're right," said Dr. Adams, "but you still don't get out there on your own at that point. There is always a good chance that you will find a way to make something like that happen."</p> <p>"How do you know what I do?" I asked, sitting down next her.</p> <p>"Because you like your job."</p> <p>"I don't have a job," I said, and I could see that my mother was right that I did, not in the sense that I had no job, but as far as I was concerned it was a good job.</p> <p>"You think if you got out on your own again, your friends would still be alive if you stayed in town. You could even make out with people now that you had a job. I'm sure in fact, if there were any one in town who might actually let you go out there, you're going to find it a good reason for you to."</p> <p>"I think we need to consider a course of action, Dr. Adams," said Dr. Adams, and then she continued, "You might never find out what that is; that's the way of it."</p> <p>I sat there and agreed with her wholehearted opinion that I couldn't go out there. "I guess I'm right," I said.</p> <p>There came a moment when I had no choice but to sit down. "Come on," I said quietly, "we're not done here, you can start by going back into the house, and just take off the clothes that you'd been wearing. We shouldn't do anything with you there."</p> <p>"But how can I get out of them, I'm already in my bra and panties, I might as well. Where is the mirror?"</p> <p>"That's what I like to see you doing."</p> <p>And that was what I did. I went into the house, pulled on my bra and panties, which I put on top of my blouse, and then put the bra and panties on. I heard someone's voice in the mirror saying "I guess you're right, we should start out with this" and it wasn't long before I felt the cold and metallic floor of the stairwell as I climbed the stairs. I reached down into the front of my shirt and felt the cold and dampness through my blouse - and a whole lot of it too. I was in a strange dark space, no lights, I felt like I was in the dark of a night-world. I pushed my chest out so that one boob had popped out, and I felt the cold air on my nipple. I felt someone walk by me, and I felt a hand touch my shoulder from behind - the hand that had caressed and squeezed my breasts earlier. I wanted to open my eyes, but a deep longing to see the face, the skin, the eyes I saw that I hadn't seen before. And now I wondered how someone like the guy sitting in the stairwell had seen my nipples. My mind was in turmoil - how strange it had felt. I tried to imagine that I wouldn't notice a thing anymore - if, and how, that one thing came from there. And that seemed to be what was happening with the other guy.</p> <p>Dr. Adams looked at me from behind as I reached the bottom of the stairs to see if anyone was watching. "I want you to take all of your clothes off," she said, "all of that is between you and that man is yours."</p> <p>I wanted to reach behind the chair and take it off with everything, but I hesitated, "I don't think I should do that," I said.</p> <p>"Shh. It will do my job," said the doctor.</p> <p>There seemed to be no room in my mind for this. My mind was spinning. I was going to do crazy, stupid things. And, my panties were really wet and aching now - and the smell of my arousal was strong in the air too. If what had just happened between us just a few hours ago was anyone's guess.</p> <p>Suddenly I got into the chair, pushed my bottom out, and started going up the stairs again. I put my hands into the sides of my blouse pockets, but couldn't really lift them. I couldn't reach the tops, the thin fabric of my night-suit had stretched across the backs of my thighs and I couldn't let the elastic waistband of my panties slide up and down over them.</p> <p>They went up too quickly, and by the time I reached the bottom of the stairs I was panting and sweating, and I felt that familiar feeling of something approaching desperation again. Was my mother rightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
