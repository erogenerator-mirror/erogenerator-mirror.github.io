A... AHHH!" I gasp as his cum erupts deep inside me. I gasp as the dildo fills my pussy and the rubber vibrating clit pushes me over the edge. I arch my back as the orgasm starts to wash over me. I can feel the walls of my pussy contract over the dildo which causes it to swell even more with the vibrations inside of me.</p> <p>My body shakes and spasms as my cum flows into him. He leans forward and kisses me. I wrap my arms around his neck and we kiss long and hard. I feel his body begin to relax against mine.</p> <p>Finally, a gentle but determined hand reaches up and caresses my face.</p> <p>"Thank you, Master," I whisper.</p> <p>He leans his head against mine and kisses me. My hands move with him. He moves them up and down my body. Our hands caress each other. His fingers trace my stomach and cup my breasts and my breasts respond.</p> <p>"Oh, Master," I whisper.</p> <p>He looks at me as his fingers trail over my nipples. He squeezes my tits together and begins to squeeze both together, one hand on my breasts while the other slides between my thighs. He is rubbing at my pussy through my shorts and I arch my back.</p> <p>I feel him pull my shorts from my body. He pulls them down to my knees and I know he wants to see my shaved pussy in the warm air.</p> <p>He leans down and begins to lick and suck on my wet pussy.</p> <p>"Ooh, Master," I whisper.</p> <p>His head plunges deep inside me. My breathing begins to become rapid now. I feel his hands and mouth working at the opening of me. He fucks my pussy with his tongue like a real cock. It is hard and demanding and I am ready to burst. My hands are pressing his head and face into me as I begin to rock and thrash under him.</p> <p>My mouth is open and I am moaning and sobbing as he eats me.</p> <p>"Oh, Master, Master, oh, oh, oh," I whisper as waves of pleasure begin to take me. The bed begins to creak and I see movement from above. I glance over at him and he has his eyes closed. I smile and see him getting harder and harder at me.</p> <p>"Oh, Master, oh... oh... oh, aah," I pant loudly.</p> <p>He lifts his head up to once again gaze into my eyes. I continue to pant into his mouth as I feel his hands move from my breasts to my pussy and pull the wet lips apart. He begins to finger fuck me and my body thrashes beneath him as another orgasm sweeps over me. He pushes even deeper inside me. He reaches across the bed and grabs something from the night table.</p> <p>"It's a vibrator," he says.</p> <p>I feel the soft toy as he touches me with it. My body jumps at the sensation.</p> <p>"Y-You're... you're... oh God!" I gasp as I feel me on the very edge of my fifth orgasm. He leans forward again and kisses me. I kiss him back and moan. He reaches down into his pocket and picks up the vibrator and smiles at me. I open my eyes to see him putting it into my left index finger.</p> <p>"Oh, no... no... this is... no... no... no!"</p> <p>He watches as he watches me put one finger inside me. I push it deep inside of me and he holds it there as I begin to squirm around my finger. I feel the tension building deep within myself. I try pushing as deep into myself as I can. It feels so good.</p> <p>"Mm. Oh, yes... oh, Master. Oh fuck, y-yes, yes, y-yes!"</p> <p>My eyes roll to the back of my head as the endorphins in my brain kick in. I push harder into myself. My eyes roll back as another wave of orgasm began to sweep over me. My body stiffens then relaxes.</p> <p>"Honey," I whisper. "It's okay. I can't take any more."</p> <p>I take his hand.</p> <p>"This is just a one time thing, I want it over with," I say.</p> <p>He nods and pulls me to him. He pushes me back so that my legs are laying flat on to the bed on either side of me. He slips a pillow under me to cover my body. I smile up at him. We can see each other's reflection in the mirror.</p> <p>"I'm not going to say anything else until later," I say.
