The soft skin was moist and smooth. "It is too hot to be covered in dust."</p> <p>"What? How?"</p> <p>"In fact, it is not dust anymore."</p> <p>"But I would like to feel it."</p> <p>"You could, but we have our own way. Besides, I will do the same for you."</p> <p>I pulled him towards me in a fierce kiss. When he was halfway there I placed his shoulders on my breasts. Reaching around and caressing them, he squeezed them lightly. I moaned deeply. It felt so nice and erotic. When he reached around and started to rub them again, I pushed him away and whispered, "Don't..."</p> <p>"Don't what?"</p> <p>"Don't do it there." I pushed his shoulders away from me. "Come."</p> <p>I took his hand and led him up to the top. I pushed him down and spread his knees apart. Then I took his head in my hands, and guided him in between my legs. He was already very wet, so when I touched him it became even more lubricated, and he was very slippery. This was a new experience, and one I like. I began to caress his balls as he slid between my wet nether lips. I leaned forward as he entered me.</p> <p>I felt some pain as he pushed himself into me. Even though it hurt, I kept trying to relax, because I wanted his cock all the way in and out between my lips. And to make up for that I started to lick him.</p> <p>It turned him on even more, even as his fingers were caressing my breasts. I could smell his sex, which was making my own lips dripping with wetness. My mouth was getting covered in the thick scent of his passion. His kisses got more and more forceful. He started to slide inside me, and as he did I grabbed his ass, holding him deeper. I could feel his pubic hair on my stomach, and as he pulled me tight I moaned in his mouth.</p> <p>I was surprised when he started to slide in and out of me with a much quicker rhythm than yesterday. As he was holding me at this same height as his balls came against my lips, I could feel that I was being taken in both hands. I felt like I could even orgasm if I wanted to, as I felt him thrust all the way in the last time. He was very deep, and it took all my control to keep from reaching my peak with him.</p> <p>That sensation made me feel so hot as I realized that there was going to be an orgasm that I was not in control of yet. Just as I was about to orgasm I pushed, and it was as if electricity went through my entire body. I shuddered and moaned as I climaxed. I was lost to his kisses as my arms fell limply to my sides.</p> <p>He held me while I recovered, and then moved down to take my lips again in a hungry kiss. My lips were already wet with his kisses, and when I felt him starting to come inside me again, I reached inside to feel him pumping while he was still inside me.</p> <p>With all the sex we enjoyed that night, it was always in the back of my mind that he would only last for three hours, but this time it would be four.</p> <p>To be continuedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
