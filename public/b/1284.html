It was as if I was seeing a different side of this world. I decided to take over my job and get more experience than that on the day of my interview.</p> <p>To be honest I really am not exactly what you call a "person with many other talents". The biggest difference between me and her is that I don't need to look like someone else to have fun and, in return, she has always been the most fun and I never had to have all the other stuff you would expect. I never expected this.</p> <p>I had just gotten back from my afternoon with Beth at my house and she was in a good mood - all smiles and bubbly. She was sitting right next to me holding my hand with her left hand on top of mine. I'm sure I was feeling pretty good.</p> <p>"Where's Alex?" she asked with that sexy smile.</p> <p>"I'm not much older than you. I've been working for you for just over a year. I really didn't expect we would finally be in town together," I replied.</p> <p>"We've had a couple of conversations already! He's a real cool guy, that's why she's so popular," she smiled.</p> <p>"So, are you going to stay home on those weekends I've been working?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm not sure. I might just work some more than I usually do. I'm not really sure which is good or bad," she stated hesitantly.</p> <p>"Hey, I have a little something I would like you to explore during your internship," I replied, "maybe, what if I told you that I am really partial to looking for what I would love to be. Are you interested in doing that?" I asked knowing she was and still wasn't sure how to go about it.</p> <p>"Oh God, of course," she quickly blurted out, "I am SOooo looking forward to this!"</p> <p>There was such an understanding about this job that I was starting to feel confident that it would work out. Plus, we were actually in a relationship! I didn't really expect to be doing this with her in the first place but then again, I thought we could always go a little farther in her relationship. Even with her being single I still liked to be with her. We were both looking to have a good time and we were both just looking for a friend. I just hoped that at least one of us would eventually show up with at least one woman to try and have a really good time.</p> <p>"OK, I'll let you in on a little secret," I answered, "I'm a bit of a big fan of "my" kind of stuff. And, like I said, I'm not exactly what you think," I told her with that sexy smile she had given me a moment ago.</p> <p>"I'm not really sure either. I just felt a little excited. Maybe the thought of you sitting next to me for a while is not a bad thing. And, well, to tell you my own personal opinion, I think you'll find that I think you're extremely attractive," she said.</p> <p>We spent another few minutes talking about everything and nothing, that seemed to be about the only topic. That was definitely more than just talking about her and Alex.</p> <p>"This is really going to be my personal first interview," I said, "but I would really like to ask you a few questions."</p> <p>"OK," she replied with a big smile.</p> <p>"And you have to get a real good picture of how this whole business works. I really do think you're going to be great," I continued.</p> <p>"I really do think so. I would really like to have a chance to help you and Alex, and I am sure you would probably feel the same way," she added.</p> <p>"No, let's just let the whole thing go," I responded, "I would never have to help you with any of it. I really do think you will find a whole lot of joy out of this job interview."</p> <p>We finally finished our coffee and I was surprised to realize how excited I was by the conversation we were already having. I told her I really did appreciate that she was in on this. At the same time I was thinking some more about the whole situation. I'm sure that we had a good time, but how soon and how easily could we take this new relationship thing back to where we had been? That thought sent me into a bit of a bit of an even more confused state.</p> <p>To be honest, I really did feel like I needed to let go of the past and go with the flow. I also knew, although I didn't really wantâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
