You need to understand that when she saw me she thought I was a hooker. She thought I was selling out to you. She thought you were the one getting everything she wanted. If it weren't for her going off with the boss's secretary, I doubt she could've stopped her. She loved every minute of it." He laughed at how smugly she was. She should've seen the pain in his eyes when he saw that look. But it wasn't over so fast. "But, when she saw your face she thought she was the one that made you sign that piece of paper. Or just maybe they were all over her desk. She saw you just as she was thinking you would do. You were right that she shouldn't have said those exact words to you. I love a stubborn ass like that. That's why I took the time to work with you."</p> <p>"I'm surprised you even wanted to be her boss. It was kind of you to take her work like that."</p> <p>"It's not like I was the boss that made her do that," he said with a knowing smirk.</p> <p>"Oh, god no. I meant that it was me," she shot back. "If I had known that, I certainly wouldn't have had you in my office."</p> <p>"It's no big deal. Believe me, I wasn't trying to hide what we had in our relationship. I just wanted to make sure you were the one that understood. Don't worry. I'm not letting you get to play with that fat bitch. I get it."</p> <p>She looked at him, not sure what he was talking about. This little battle with him, she figured was part of the game. After all, no one was really supposed to care what he did in the office anymore.</p> <p>"So, what's an A/F job anyway?" she asked, trying to figure out how he knew most of it.</p> <p>"You're right," he smiled. He was clearly enjoying being in his office with her.</p> <p>"You've got your eye on someone?"</p> <p>"Yeah." He paused. "Well, I can't keep them locked up forever. After a while, it becomes harder and harder if they aren't going to have a productive day."</p> <p>She looked at the ceiling, not believing he was actually letting her spend more time around him than they already were. She looked down at the papers they were going through. What the hell was he talking about here?</p> <p>"Well," she said, looking back to him. He nodded. "Okay. Let's go."</p> <p>---</p> <p>They arrived at her apartment just as the sun began to set.</p> <p>She turned the key and opened the door. Before she even realized what she was doing, he was pulling her into his arms and hugging her. In the few short seconds it took for them to embrace, they were the proverbial one standing there naked. Neither one of them noticed that the other had finished making love to her. Neither one of them knew what was now happening to them.</p> <p>She had just stood there for a few seconds, stunned by his love for her. Then she realized that she did not know him. But then she knew that she did not care. She also no longer cared for him. At that moment she knew that for sure she loved him and loved being with him.</p> <p>He was still looking at her with that smile that she knew she could see right through. She looked down at his cock, slowly standing up against his leg. She was starting to get turned on thinking about this day with him and what she had done with him, even though she was so sure they would never be together again.</p> <p>She smiled feeling her pussy get wet again. Her pussy never stopped turning when she thought of it. She could feel her nipples grow a little harder and knew she was getting wet, just thinking of it, though her mind was now fixated on him. She started to unbuckle his belt, but before she got it free of his pants, she remembered the other part of his plan for the day.</p> <p>"No, wait…" She began to say, but she couldn't finish. He had unzipped his pants, and she saw his beautiful, hard penis and thought of the taste it would have, as he had done to her. She knew this wasn't going to be like before. This was a long night of sex. But he had been so patient with her.</p> <p>"Oh, it's okay," he managed to say. "I like being with you," he said, gently pulling open her blouse.</p> <p>"Just go slow," she said, trying to stop him.</p> <p>"Why? Isn't that what you want?" he asked. "Just go slow."</p> <p>"We can get back to where we—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
