It was as if we were playing a different game, but I just had to laugh a little bit.</p> <p>"Are you two going to come out later," Kelly asked.</p> <p>"Hell yeah, and by the time we get done, you'll be ready for it." I said, and she blushed. She made the same comment about my "shocked look". I got my own laugh, but it wasn't a little too intense because she leaned against me in my arms.</p> <p>"Do you have to change your clothes again?" I asked. "I feel the need to try on another." I added, then asked, "And maybe the one you're wearing tonight?"</p> <p>"I hope so," she replied with a coy smile. "I like it. It's nice."</p> <p>We walked back to the dressing rooms holding hands. "Did you have fun with Kelly?" she asked, just before giving me a smile which seemed to sparkle and sparkle, at the same time.</p> <p>****</p> <p>It was a while before I started the movie. We sat and made out on the couch, and then we started kissing again on the couch. The next room upstairs, in the movie theater, provided a better view. We broke off kissing and headed towards the back. Once there, Kelly started kissing my neck.</p> <p>"Mm...mm. You're so soft" she said, before she bit my ear. I could only shudder. Kelly continued this with her hand on my leg, sliding to my thigh and then the waist. She was slowly stroking my cock through my pants now, and it was hard as a rock.</p> <p>"Take it out for me." She said. I took a step back, and then I unzipped my pants. I pulled my cock out. It was already half hard and wet with pre cum. I sat down on the couch, pulled Kelly towards me, and we made out again.</p> <p>"Does it feel good?" she asked. "You really make me feel good when you take care of me."</p> <p>"It's wonderful." I said, kissing her neck as I reached down and stroked her. As I did this, I could feel her finger rubbing against my lips, and then I let her finger slip in my mouth and explore. She pulled my leg upwards and then pulled me towards her. I felt her pussy close around my cock and pull me towards it. I felt the heat of her pussy on my tip. She pulled away, and then ran her tongue across my lips. "No...not yet," she moaned, "we're going to play." She took her finger out of my mouth and slipped it in to replace hers.</p> <p>"God, yes." I said, and I guided my dick to her pussy. I pushed in, feeling her warmth and tightness. I had to stop when I was almost all the way in.</p> <p>"You're so big." She said, breathing hard as I felt her pussy envelope my tip.</p> <p>"You're so soft..." I said, "And you feel so good when you're ready to go".</p> <p>Kelly leaned her head back on the couch, closed her eyes, and began to moan. She started breathing hard, as I stroked more slowly. With each push, she was more vocal.</p> <p>"Mmm. Fuck me, lover." She said with a grin. I continued to stroke her until I was ready to cum.</p> <p>"Not yet...not yet...oh god, please...fuck me now!" she begged. I leaned her back against the back of the couch and slid myself into her. My cock slid in and out as I did this, and she could feel the tip touch the walls of her pussy.</p> <p>"Fuck me... fuck me... fuck me!" She cried.</p> <p>It seemed we were both going to cum together, and yet, each time I tried pushing myself all the way in, I could feel her gripping me and squeezing me. We were both cumming and cumming some more, but the intensity of my second orgasm was gone. I just fucked her for a while longer and went deeper as did she, until finally, I was still all the way in her pussy.</p> <p>"Hang on, lover." she said. She moved around the other couch and bent over. As she did this, I was now fucking her from behind. "Fuck me harder." she ordered. I did as she asked and fucked her harder. She was moaning now, but saying nothing, I could tell she was going through a little orgasm. "Hush, lover. Hold still. I want you to be able to see me when I cum." and she did. I could tell she was going to cum again now. I pumped into her fast. We both looked as weâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
