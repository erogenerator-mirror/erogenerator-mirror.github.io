Jake said with an embarrassed grin. "I didn't have that much fun!"</p> <p>"Well, that was pretty awesome," I said, laughing as we went to the living room. "But there's no fun in the family. I'm not going to get a date. I am still married! That's not going to happen!"</p> <p>"That won't happen anytime in a hurry, Honey," Jake said, pulling me to him to kiss me. "It would actually make a good date for me when you get home."</p> <p>His kiss seemed very sweet and it helped me sleep. As I lay there, I heard the sound of our bodies slapping against each other, and I wondered what it was that he was doing to me. I was really enjoying our time together. After he went to the bathroom, I returned to the kitchen. Jake was at the kitchen island and I went over to him.</p> <p>"You seem a little tense, honey," I said.</p> <p>"It's because I'm really nervous being alone like this."</p> <p>That really made me feel better to know how I was affecting him. This was our first date and I was feeling very warm and excited. "You're really nervous, too," I said.</p> <p>"Yeah; I'm getting a little bit," he answered with a smile. "You know, Jake, I'm really enjoying this." We exchanged a brief look that seemed friendly.</p> <p>I thought about his comment about the thought of having sex with his wife, and felt it was right after all. I leaned over and kissed him again, and then again on the lips when we were in the bedroom.</p> <p>"I think you're doing a good job, honey," I said, letting him slide his hands up my arms to my shoulders. "Are you feeling ready to go ahead and go, too?" Jake asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm starting to," I replied, feeling a little nervous as my pussy started pulsating for him.</p> <p>"Okay, honey; I'm ready for you. I have some things I want you to know about..."</p> <p>"Okay." I could see in his eyes that he was feeling a little uneasy.</p> <p>"I want nothing more than a nice long, long, hard, good fuck," I said, and it sounded even more confident than I had hoped. "You can start anywhere, Honey!"</p> <p>By that time I had unbuttoned his pants and had slid them down to his ankles. His cock stood proudly at attention, jutting out from his body, straining a little. When I gave the head a kiss, it didn't take long before I was stroking him with one hand while my mouth slid down his cock and I took his balls into my mouth. As I sucked on them with my lips, I felt his legs start to tremble. A few minutes later, he groaned and I stopped.</p> <p>"That was great, honey," he said. "I can't wait any longer."</p> <p>I smiled up at him and kissed him again.</p> <p>"Let's get this place cleaned up and go have a nice dinner," I said. "Then, when you feel ready, come take me to bed."</p> <p>His mouth quirked as he agreed. "All set," he said.</p> <p>"I'll see you in a couple hours," I said. "I'm sure there's a special place you could put my bed." I kissed him again and then I got out of the kitchen."</p> <p>"I can't wait to see you!" he said. "I have a surprise waiting for you," and he started pulling the door to the living room open.</p> <p>I was glad it was a warm evening already. After the quick little kiss, it seemed like an ideal night to be alone. Jake had been sitting in a chair at the dining table just a few minutes and a soft glow had been glowing on his face. As he stood up, he took my hands and kissed me on the cheek. I was feeling a little excited. His lips felt so soft and warm. His eyes were smiling at me like a big cat. I looked into his eyes.</p> <p>"You really are going to surprise me, aren't you, baby? Did you come to me?" He asked, and I couldn't answer his question.</p> <p>"I'm gonna do so many things to you now," he promised in a serious tone. "And more to you! We are going to make love like that. You can tell me as we go until it doesn't last!"</p> <p>That was my first clue to what was coming. A man had kissed me so lightly that I nearly thought that I didn't know who it was. Then he leaned forward and kissed me softly, lovingly, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
