"It's not over yet. I have to get my outfit together and get out to the market. I need to get dressed." She paused for several seconds to gather her thoughts and then stepped out of the door. She went toward the cash register but paused when she saw the man standing there. She could tell just by the way he looked him, that this could not be a mistake. He seemed to be about six feet tall with black hair that had streaks of gray. She recognized his voice and the slight accent in it. He turned to her, smiled, and came over and hugged her. "I thought you had a little something coming. My name is Jake. Here you're a very special young lady, looking beautiful. I just bought this to look nice and wear. I'm so glad we can get that little bit of freedom without the hassle of buying us some new clothes. This would be nice." Then he took her chin in his left hand and lifted it back up. "I hope you can still be happy after all this time, baby," and smiled at the look on her face. Jake continued to look at her for a moment, "I am sure glad the old lady you gave me your number would call. You are most certainly special, baby. And I can't wait to get my hands on you. When I get home, I will be so glad to do it again," while he walked over and kissed her on the cheek. "I don't have to be home until tomorrow either," he said, as he turned and walked over to the register.</p> <p>"I have to get into the market quickly, honey," Amy told her husband as he opened the register for her. "I'm going to need a lot of work tonight. Have to get some things tomorrow. The other day, I was supposed to buy some new clothes. But the shop has to close at 2:00 so they have to come up." She said as she finished her shopping at the checkout. She watched as he checked out and then turned to walk back toward the house. "I can't wait til tomorrow to get out of here," she thought as she went to the front door and opened it.</p> <p>When Jake walked into the backyard, she looked around at the scene. "Wow, this is so cool. There's no one home except for two of us." Jake had always been a boisterous one. He always had something else going on in the house and this, it seemed, was definitely something new. He walked over the lounge and took a seat beside her. "Would you like a glass of wine?" he asked.</p> <p>"I think so. Not too many. Why?" Amy asked as she finished up her shopping.</p> <p>"You have a lovely house. I think you should come and own it. I'm certain we could buy something along the way, if you were interested," Jake replied. "I like it a lot," she told him.</p> <p>The conversation stopped then, as he moved over to the bar. "Let's go into the back yard and have a couple of cocktails. You can start drinking them as much as you want."</p> <p>When Jake returned he handed her a drink. "Would you like to go back inside?" he asked.</p> <p>"Oh yes!" she replied, "That sounds fun. Just let me take my shoes off and we can sit in the chair together and watch some television with our drinks." Jake smiled as he watched her take her shoes off and walk into the back yard.</p> <p>As soon as they approached the sofa, Jake sat down and pulled her on top of him. "Baby, I have waited long enough. I want to take you to bed right now," Jake said. At hearing Amy's reply, he reached and grabbed hold of her hips and pulled her hips down so that she was straddling him. "But first, we must take something off. I don't want to put too much on while I'm gone," Jake said as he started to ease himself out of his shorts.</p> <p>As Jake walked by the counter, he called over "You can come out of the bathroom behind him. The robe should be a bit loose so you won't be getting in any trouble," before leaving the room. Amy stood on wobbly legs, as Jake closed the robe and pulled it over his head. "You can come here on the chair side. You can sit there next to me." Before returning to the sofa, he slipped out of his shorts and walked over to the sofa. As he sat down, he lifted himself over so that he was sitting on the edge of the sofa.</p> <p>Amy could see a tent in his trunks and she gave a small smile. "Let's go change," she said, as she stepped into the bathroom. "Do it quickly," she told himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
