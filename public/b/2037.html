"This room is empty."</p> <p>"Just like any other office, it's usually empty," I said as she pulled out the video computer. She flipped through it quickly.</p> <p>"It makes sense," she said with a smile as she sat the video on her desk and pulled up her desk phone. We watched the action on it for a moment and then she pulled up the video player. She sat down with a gasp when she saw what we were looking at.</p> <p>"Oh, my God." she stammered. "You have got to be kidding."</p> <p>"It's nothing but a video game," I offered. "There's no need for that."</p> <p>"Oh, come on," she said as she handed the video off to me.</p> <p>"I don't know how it turns out," she said as she took a look through the view box one minute then went on and on. "I can't play any of that stuff," she said as she put a hand on her lap.</p> <p>I nodded and watched. She pushed the button on the video and the screen filled with scenes of various activities. The scene itself was pretty hot. She was looking over the action on the screen and occasionally looking between the camera's as she laughed and joked.</p> <p>"This," she laughed as she clicked on the play button. "This is pretty hot."</p> <p>"Do you think you're that hot?" I countered as I watched her take the video out of view.</p> <p>"Yes, I do," she said as she laid one hand on her thigh. Her face was flushed. "How do you like the movies?"</p> <p>I smiled as she flipped the play button. "Not bad for a first timer," I quipped.</p> <p>Her grin quickly turned to a frown in reply to my statement. "Really?"</p> <p>I nodded.</p> <p>"It's funny how the guys in these kind of films can get really turned on when you don't know who's doing it to them," I said. "Do you do this stuff for women?"</p> <p>"Yes, the guys," she laughed. "But not for porn."</p> <p>"I didn't know that," I said. "Would you like to see some of the real action?"</p> <p>"No, it's your movie."</p> <p>"I thought as much," I smiled as I lifted my chair and sat back. "Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Positive," she said as she clicked the play button. "I mean, what happens on the screen won't last long. They'll end."</p> <p>"I bet you say that all the time," I said as I leaned back on my hands.</p> <p>"I just get more and more excited and want to see it again. What do you think?"</p> <p>"I agree," I said with a shrug. "What do you think of the way the camera moves?"</p> <p>"I don't know. I'm not sure what to think," she said as she turned to face the screen. "This kind of stuff is kind of sexy."</p> <p>When the movie finished a minute later, she clicked the play button again and we sat there for a moment watching the movie and catching our breaths.</p> <p>"Do you want me to go and get our popcorn?" I offered after a few moments of silence.</p> <p>"No," she said and looked down, biting her lower lip. "I'm getting too hot and it's killing me."</p> <p>"It's okay," I said as I stood up to leave. She sat up, holding out her hand to stop me. "I have lots of energy for a few more minutes."</p> <p>"No, wait," she said. "I have a movie I'd like to watch." It looked like she was about to say "Porn," when we heard the music playing from inside the TV room.</p> <p>I stood at the door, tapping the remote a couple of times before reaching for the remote control again. "Wait, wait," she said almost pleadingly.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>She reached down into her lap. "I've been holding my breath all night," she sighed. "It's too hot out here."</p> <p>"That's okay," I replied as I pulled the small remote out of her hands. I put it against my neck and held it in front of my face, trying to find a way to avoid looking at her.</p> <p>"I have a surprise for you if you want a ride home."</p> <p>I waited for the door to open as I sat back down to watch her take the video from the screen.
