She'd read that if you were going to do something with the work, do it yourself. It sounded like a good idea, although it didn't sound much like how others worked. She had to be a little careful to be as professional as possible. Her colleagues were probably too busy working with her to notice her because of her personal assistant persona, but she'd have to trust them. Not just because she seemed the type of person who wouldn't give in to the demands of working with other people, but because most people would just get into the discussion anyway. Or she would just be like anyone else.</p> <p>What had happened to her? There was no other way to put it. She didn't enjoy all that much having sex with other men and she had no interest being a lesbian, even though she had the freedom to go and have sex with other women whenever she felt like it. What had happened to her in those three months wasn't some strange occurrence that happened in the workplace, but actually happened. Who knows what her life was like.</p> <p>Just when Kaitlin realized she should just leave, Mr. K had her by the hand. She tried to put it down to her imagination but she kept remembering the image of him on the sofa. His skin looked smooth and his lips looked hard and strong. He had that look. It almost excited her. She didn't want it to ever stop. After seeing the images of his lips, then his body on the sofa, she'd have some trouble not thinking about him again.</p> <p>He'd always looked so strong and strong with all that strength in one place. He was so strong. The strength in him made her feel safe and loved to have him. She wouldn't forget him.</p> <p>Kaitlin had looked over at Mr. K's office. The walls were covered in glass so she could just barely see the shape of the office in the room. Kaitlin found herself wondering if Mr. K and the boys at work had the same view as her when they worked. She wondered if Mr. K was in fact in the same room as her while she worked, as she was doing work at the same time. Was the guy doing what she thought they were doing at home? Kaitlin decided that whatever they were doing in the office was really that good. She was a lot happier than the guys she worked with or anyone else for that matter.</p> <p>She had to admit one thing, she liked watching Mr. K. She watched the way that he would move when he saw Kaitlin sitting there. She wondered why she had watched him and even if he really worked for her. She liked him, and he liked her. He didn't have any idea of what he was doing for her but it would be her alone to do the job. Maybe he wouldn't mind her watching him for as long as it did. Kaitlin got a little excited at the thought of Kaitlin watching him. She wondered what she was supposed to be doing, what she was about to do, but it didn't matter to her. She was Mr. K's.</p> <p>"You know, it sounded like you might need a break today." Mr. K said. Kaitlin started to look up. "I'll go and get a glass of water and some aspirin. Don't wait up for me. I need to get into work when Kaitlin gets back."</p> <p>"Thanks Mr. K. I should go to work now. I will have your boss on the case when I get back. And thanks too," Kaitlin said to him before getting up to leave.</p> <p>Kaitlin walked into the kitchen, the warm morning sunlight warm on her bare arm, the cold morning air of downtown just around her neck, and headed towards her office. She stopped in the foyer to pick up a piece of paper that Mr. K had given her. She handed it to the young assistant at work that gave her name, then put the pen back in her wallet.</p> <p>Before she left the office Kaitlin opened her locker and picked out her bra and panties. She got her things out, grabbed her gym bag and ran out to the car. She parked the car and started the engine, then got back in to the car and started off towards home. It seemed strange to her at first to be going through the building at the same time as Kaitlin, but as she drove Kait thought she had seen Kaitlin in different places when she drove past them. Now she had a lot to look at that time and time again, especially from the first day that they had been together.</p> <p>She had to admit that Kaitlin had been a very attractive girl. She could be on the phone and in an instant, Kaitâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
