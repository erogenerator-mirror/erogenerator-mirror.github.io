"I'll call you when I get home." And, almost instantly, she was off down the street to make her mother's phone call.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>"This phone's not answering," said the phone thief. "I want to be on duty."</p> <p>"What is that?" Mrs. Robinson asked.</p> <p>"This is Jack Black." The caller answered, and Jack replied. "I want to talk to you again, before you come to work."</p> <p>"Hello?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes!" came this voice. "I just saw you...and... I just know what happens to people that don't have a cellphone."</p> <p>"That wasn't very nice," Mrs. Robinson asked. "Was it? Tell me who you are."</p> <p>"I'm Jack Black," said Black.</p> <p>"And what makes you think you are on top of a chain of pizza boxes that don't deliver anymore?" asked Mrs. Robinson sarcastically.</p> <p>"I have a business proposition," Black answered. "Something I would like to run into with you before we go on the road..."</p> <p>"No! No," replied Mrs. Robinson. "Oh, sorry. I haven't had a chance to talk to you again."</p> <p>"It's okay, Mrs. Robinson," Black answered. "I'm in town to see my mother. Can I come pick you up in a few minutes?"</p> <p>"I'm not going to answer that," Mrs. Robinson replied. "At least not yet. I won't let you have anything. And if you don't want it, get to your vehicle. I have a cell phone with me, just in case. You wouldn't want it to be soiled by me, would you?" Then she hung up.</p> <p>Black had called the Black cell-phone to pick her up. He didn't know if she could come with him, though. He also didn't want her to see him. The Black was too small to be Jack. That would be too obvious.</p> <p>He had called the Black one, who had been calling in the last weeks for trouble. The Black, when he was still in town, had stopped by his mother's house so that he could help her get home to her mother. The Black and his mother were just two single guys, who had no kids at home either. They had just been there at the last minute when the Black had decided to give up his apartment and come home to go to school.</p> <p>The Black had come back to see his mother at one of the neighborhood events. She was still a young looking lady and he couldn't help but think of her. Jack had not been paying much attention to her in years. And, it had been awhile. She hadn't seen him in a long time and had been getting more upset and angry with each day. The Black had come on to him.</p> <p>As Jack entered his driveway, he saw a black car with two occupants on the passenger side; the Black one got into the driver's seat and the Black passenger into the back. The Black was holding a cell phone of his own.</p> <p>Black had a way with women. They knew instinctively what he and was about to do. Jack realized that he was getting pretty excited, but he was not going to take advantage of the situation. He was not willing to lose Jack Black.</p> <p>Jack unlocked his front door and walked in without knocking. He didn't want to see Black's body. It was all over, in his mind. He didn't want to see anyone in a compromising position with Black. He had to keep his cool.</p> <p>Black had come around to the driver's side and had opened his door. He had taken an in-flight video of something and had made sure it was connected to the TV in the house, so that he could see both of them while taking advantage of time for himself.</p> <p>Black had taken a couple steps back toward the car, and he pushed his knees to spread them like a football player would. He smiled at Jack, who didn't understand how a little girl could have some sort of role in their lives. He had been around some trouble guys in the past. A little girl could have a pretty good head; a tough one. But, there was something about a little girl.</p> <p>"Hey, Jack," Black said. He walked around the car and over to Jack's side. "I would like to talk to you, just to make sure you take good care of you, okay?"</p> <p>"Just tell me what's going on," Jack replied.</p> <p>"I called and they gave me some business cards to call my own and we'll call them when we get back to my place," Black answered. "Is that okay, if that is alright?"</p> <p>Jack smiled a little, and looked at him. â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
