I asked.</p> <p>"Probably too tired for another round of sex with your father," she answered. "And I'm tired enough for it not to really bother me. Anyway, I've been awake for over three hours now and I can honestly say I'm ready to fall asleep."</p> <p>I got in bed with her and spooned her, getting some very good rest in that position.</p> <p>The next thing I knew, I had my arms on the back of the sofa beside her and I drifted off to sleep immediately.</p> <p>I awoke to the familiar sounds of my daughter's loud and very vocal snoring. Then before I could gather my thoughts, I felt both her hands grasp my cock and a second later I knew she was sliding her head down the shaft of my cock and her lips were sucking on my balls. Before I knew it I found that I was reaching down the back of the sofa to cup and squeeze her breasts. Then I was pulling her onto her knees and I rolled her up on her side and she slid her mouth down around the cock that slid into her mouth and down the shaft of the last inch of my cock.</p> <p>"Oh my," she murmured. "That feels so good."</p> <p>"You liked it when I came inside your cunt?" I quipped.</p> <p>"I think so," she said and looked up and smiled. "It felt like you were doing me a little treat."</p> <p>"I'm ready to get back to sleep now," I said seriously. "Just hold me tight."</p> <p>"Just hold me tight until I fall to sleep," she replied. "Please?"</p> <p>I felt as if I was being thrown off balance by her question.</p> <p>"I am tired," she said. "I think I'm going to fall into bed with you if we keep going."</p> <p>"I wouldn't know where to sleep," I replied. "So you either go to sleep in my arms or you go to sleep in my bed."</p> <p>"No you don't," she said as she rose up off my cock and went to my side. "You get up here and you'll take me. Your wife is asleep in the arm chair now, so you should take the rest of the day off and go to bed."</p> <p>"Can I sleep in your bed?" I repeated.</p> <p>"Yes," she answered, "and I do mean it."</p> <p>She turned and I kissed her deeply on the mouth and my tongue slid into hers. She opened her mouth and welcomed me in, my hands sliding down her body to her breasts as we kissed. She responded by slowly rubbing her pelvis back and forth against my hard cock.</p> <p>"Mmm, that's nice," she said.</p> <p>"If you're all right with that, we can make it up to me," I said, moving my hands from her breasts down to caress her bottom. "I wouldn't want to waste time if we don't end up fucking before we're both ready."</p> <p>"What would you have to lose?" she asked. "I'm in a position where I have a beautiful woman right here to take care of me."</p> <p>"You don't waste time?" I asked, "What would I have to do?"</p> <p>"Whatever you want," she answered, "just let me know. We're about to get a nice night of sleep together."</p> <p>"Let's do it my way then," I agreed. "This is my favorite way for sleeping with you."</p> <p>"We're not going to share my sleeping room," she countered. "I don't have the same kind of bed."</p> <p>"I think there's room for us," I said. "Just rest for a while."</p> <p>"Okay" she agreed, "it's only about a half hour from here."</p> <p>And she turned around and faced me. I pulled the t-shirt over the top of her head and threw it over onto the sofa, then I reached down and took her hand and pulled her to me. Our lips pressed together as we kissed, our tongues slipping into each other's mouth. She felt as if she had been kissed for months as my hands cupped her ample breasts, her nipples stiffening into little points as my fingers caressed them through the thin fabric of her night-dress. We made out for at least fifteen minutes as we kissed and fondled each other, and I ran my hands under her night-dress and caressed herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
