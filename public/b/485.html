"Do you have any experience?"</p> <p>Maggie laughed. "It's a guy's dream come true. It's as if a small part of me wants to get in on the show. I could go on for hours, or something. I can dance like this," she explained, wiggling her tits back and forth and looking at me.</p> <p>"A lap dance is a lap dance," I clarified. "My whole world revolves around you. It's actually a very nice set of tits, which is always the same thing."</p> <p>Amber jumped in. "I know how to do that," she said, pulling her shirt up, exposing her breasts. "Let me tell you a story." Amber ran her hand over her chest. I could actually see her nipple begin to swell.</p> <p>We sat there for a few beats until Mike's voice rang. "Hey Matt. I just wanted to get in on the action now. We've only got a few minutes." The whole time they had still not said anything.</p> <p>At that time Amber slid forward in the seat and put her arms around my neck. She planted her lips on mine and pressed up against me. Her breasts smashed against my chest.</p> <p>"I am Amber," she whispered into my mouth. They were huge. I pulled her close and kissed her deeply, holding her face with my hands. It didn't take long and we were both naked under the sheets. When they finished, she pulled back slowly. She took my hand and led me to the bed where we lay down. I kissed my way down first, and then she dropped to her knees.</p> <p>"My God Amber, do you still have any clothes on?"</p> <p>"Amber, I'm sorry about earlier. I just wanted you to know that I'm naked under this sheet."</p> <p>"That's okay. I don't mind. I don't think anyone would see me. You're covered up. You're not being naked any other way. I love showing my body off for you."</p> <p>"It's not really necessary. I thought that I had nothing like it when we arrived. If I didn't have clothes on we would have done this much."</p> <p>"Amber, you still have the same little body I just show off."</p> <p>She reached up and kissed her way up my belly, teasing at my lips with her tongue before slipping it between them. I could feel her warm breath in my face and could smell the sweet scent of her perfume. I moaned gently, which surprised her.</p> <p>"I have a confession to make," she continued. "The idea of having sex with another woman was a bit of a fantasy of mine for a very long time."</p> <p>Maggie slid down a little further and began licking my thighs. I felt my lips get wetter as she approached the juncture of my legs. I groaned as she licked the wetness, her tongue sliding along the crease.</p> <p>"Amber, do you like the idea that I'm here?" she asked. "I'm sure I'll like the next scene. After all, it's always an added bonus. What do you think I should do first?"</p> <p>My answer was to lean back and spread my legs as wide as I could, opening my pussy up to Maggie. My lips opened, and the tip of Maggie's tongue penetrated me. For a few seconds, she just rested there. Slowly she began to lick, flicking the tip while sliding her tongue in and out, then sliding the full length in and out. It felt wonderful, and I had to press her back a little with my hands so that she could not slide it out. After a few minutes, Maggie returned to licking my wet hole. "God that feels fantastic. You feel so good in there," she said.</p> <p>After awhile of this, Maggie moved the tip of her tongue up further and licked the top of my button. "Oh Amber, my ass has had time to rest and I think that I'll have to do this again."</p> <p>"Amber, please don't tease me like that," Maggie begged. "If this is what I think it is, I don't see the need for teasing."</p> <p>"Yes, I think we can do it this time," Amber said. "Maybe next time my pussy can get some tongue action." She grinned and slid her tongue back down to my button. Maggie pressed up and licked my pussy some more. It was so hard to sit still for that long. When she pushed my button into her mouth just once, my whole body convulsed, and I had the most mind blowing orgasm of my life.</p> <p>Maggie kissed her way back down my bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
