"We were all naked too, but I was still very young when all this started."</p> <p>"That's very nice to know," said Matt. She was right now, he was being stripped of all his clothes and his big cock was growing even more than it had been before.</p> <p>"I never thought that a woman would enjoy a man's cock, but you have already done a fabulous job of making me forget it. You must have been a naughty girl, that's amazing."</p> <p>"Oh, don't take it personally, honey. It's nothing that you did to me or anyone else in my life. I liked it very much, but I guess that's because I was feeling particularly playful.</p> <p>"I never know how to be too modest when my own husband is naked too. You're very beautiful, though. I love it when you don't cover them up every time you wear them. I can't even think what a disappointment it must be to him."</p> <p>She reached out and grabbed his hand and pulled him up on her lap, facing him. "Matt, I don't want to take things anymore."</p> <p>He laughed. "Yeah, I'm sure I can think of a better way to be naked for now."</p> <p>"I don't need to take things any more, honey, I've already gone down on you."</p> <p>"No, you haven't. You did a marvelous job there."</p> <p>Jessica pulled his hand to her mouth and sucked on his finger. Then she put it to her mouth and sucked on it before she put it on herself. He kissed her and she slipped a wet finger into his mouth. He sucked on it, trying to be careful not to taste himself on her. It came back to him with a pop and Jessica was ready for more. She sat up and ran her hands up and down her body. "Now I'm really getting hot. How about we keep this secret for as long as we want?"</p> <p>"Deal."</p> <p>"It won't be much longer," Matt said with a smile.</p> <p>"Don't I get to come in, honey?" Jessica asked as she sat up.</p> <p>"I don't care," he answered. "This is what I want. I don't want to ruin your plans and you didn't go down on me to get me off. I want to taste you, too." She kissed him and laid back in his arms.</p> <p>They lay in each other's arms for a minute, enjoying the warmth and comfort of each other's bodies.</p> <p>"So, how do you feel about going camping naked every day?" Jessica asked.</p> <p>"That's not entirely unappreciative. It's a lot more fun when you're naked."</p> <p>"Me, too," she said. "I still have a really big crush on you. But I also really liked the way I felt kissing you, and I'm pretty horny, too." She lay back again and spread her legs and put the tip of Matt's cock inside her. "Oh, honey, it's been a while since I've had anything up my ass. Do you want to butt-fuck me too, sweetie?"</p> <p>"I'll try," he answered. "It would be my pleasure."</p> <p>Matt was a bit on the short side, but he got his cock ready and shoved it in her again. "You're so beautiful," he told her. "Let's get some sleep."</p> <p>"Let's sleep some more. You'll never know when I get a hard-on like thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
