I'll take a break but let's make an ice cream cone first. That'll make the difference between the ice cream and what that girl has to offer, I'm sure." He reached for that glass, grabbed a napkin and started to dab around it.</p> <p>She looked up at him as he dabbed at the top with a dry one. She nodded and handed the glass back. "That'll do nicely. It's not a large one but I can make for myself."</p> <p>"I'll take that. Want to help me get warmed up a little?" He was so eager and eager he felt himself growing hard. He could have sat through an earthquake but wanted to save his strength. He wanted to see her naked, he wanted to hear her moans and groans and let her play him while he shot his hot cum on her bare skin, he wanted to please her, he wanted to please himself.</p> <p>"I wish you could... just do something to me."</p> <p>"Of course, darling."</p> <p>She got the ice cream cone and started to walk away from him but stopped in front of him. She leaned forward and his body tensed up. She looked at him with a devilish grin on her face and began to rub his neck, making the muscles ripple and flex as she rubbed his neck with her palms.</p> <p>Suddenly he felt himself getting hard again. She was rubbing him down with her palms, rubbing his hard cock and the skin on his lower abdomen.</p> <p>"That's it. That's what you're doing there, isn't it?" She smiled and let go of his neck, pulling his hand down to her crotch to rub herself against his palm. "You're making yourself even harder, aren't you."</p> <p>He moaned and pressed his hand into her crotch. She was getting really worked up, her moans getting louder and heavier.</p> <p>"I'm making myself hard enough to beat out machines, aren't I? Then maybe, perhaps, you would want to rub my clit. Do you want to rub my clit?"</p> <p>"Uh huh."</p> <p>Suddenly his body tensed up again, a look of shock on his face. His hand was getting wet from his own pre-cum but he was not doing anything that was not good for business.</p> <p>"What the..."</p> <p>"Don't stop. I want to feel you. I want to make you cum. I want to make you cum in my hand."</p> <p>"I.."</p> <p>"Don't stop. Don't stop. Just rub."</p> <p>"Oh! No. nooo."</p> <p>She pulled his hand to her pussy. Slowly her hand slid along his fingers until they were wet. She wrapped his hand in her palm and gave his fingers a quick stroke.</p> <p>"Now we'll save this. Do you want me to rub your clit now?"</p> <p>His eyes widened a little. "No. I really am going to do that. Please don't stop."</p> <p>He could see her watching her hands and he felt that she was loving this too.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" His voice had changed a little, more confident now and his voice sounded more confident and confident.</p> <p>She shook her head with a smile. "I thought it would be nice. I've been waiting a long time to do this," she said smiling. "How about we start in just a little different position?"</p> <p>She moved his hand off her crotch. He could not get the idea of putting down a machine without her cumming on the floor but then he thought about her doing it in his mouth so soon. He wanted to get her to the brink.</p> <p>He took of his shirt but she turned him around with her arms wrapped around him and said, "Let me take the rest of your shirt off."</p> <p>He followed her with his shirt coming off. She let go of his cock and it went through the air but stayed as it was. His heart was racing as his heart felt so warm.</p> <p>She looked at his chest. It was a little bit sweaty from running. She grabbed it a little bit more and took a hold of him and slowly she moved it against her mouth. She looked up at him with a big smile on her face while she sucked the top of his head.</p> <p>She looked at his face and said, "You've got quite a package." She ran her tongue along his bottom lip before she sucked it. She moved her head up and down and back and forth. She took his top lip between her teeth and lightly brushed them against his smooth skin.</p> <p>"You've got me all hot and bothered, huh?" she said pulling onto one side of his leg at a ninety degree angle and rubbing along his thigh.</p> <p>"Yeah... I'm still trying to get used toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
