Her pussy was swollen with desire and the head was wet inside of her, as she wanted it inside of her. She wanted to feel it inside of her, like she had never wanted to be fucked in her life. Her lips were open, her eyes wild, her legs bent back at the knees, as she stared at him. Her eyes were sparkling.</p> <p>"Do you like my kiss?" she taunted.</p> <p>"Yes" he replied. He did, he replied immediately. Yes! She thought. Her legs parted, and she moved around in front of him, giving him a very seductive seductive view from her position on the couch. She was so very wet and he thought his cock would explode.</p> <p>She slid her hand around his cock and slid him easily into her pussy. It was tight on the first few inches, but she moved in and out of him, fucking him with long hard strokes. Then she began her own rhythmic fucking movement, and he felt himself losing control. He knew that he would not be able to hold out much longer.</p> <p>"I want you to cum in me, right down my throat," she said. He was glad to hear that.</p> <p>She moved around in front of him, and, taking his cock in her hands, she started sucking him while fucking him. Their movements became faster as he began to tremble in her mouth and felt his balls tighten.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum" he panted.</p> <p>"In my mouth, I'm cumming too," she said, letting go, taking his cock back into her mouth and stroking herself. "In my cunt and make me cum," she finished as she looked at him and gave him a kiss.</p> <p>His cock was rigid in her hands, twitching as she stroked it. She felt it spurt hot cum into her hands, and she felt as though she was cumming on the spot. She rubbed his balls as his cum filled her hand. He was still shuddering.</p> <p>"Oh, God! That was sooooo good! Did I say that? I loved it!" She continued to stroke him as his cock began to soften, which caused him to soften too. "There you go", was all she said while standing up and pulling his hand to her lips, kissing it in turn. There was a long moment while her hands roamed all over him, before she leaned forward and sucked his shrinking cock back into her mouth. She worked it with her lips and tongue, gently, with just a small amount of suction.</p> <p>"Wow", was all he could say as his arms went around her with both of their heads still in one place. He was still trying to recover from the last few climaxes from his orgasm. She finally released him, and he felt a little light headed. He felt as if he had passed out.</p> <p>"Wow!" she said again as she looked at all the cum that was all over her. "How do you know? I've never felt as turned on as I do after someone else cumming in my mouth! I loved it!"</p> <p>"It was incredible," he said as he leaned down and kissed her.</p> <p>It was more than they had experienced, and she felt so incredible that she enjoyed the experience even further. They lay there and kissed, both of them enjoying the experience of their first kiss in weeks. She put her fingers to his lips, urging him to stop when he began to apologize. She pulled him towards her, and she kissed him on the mouth.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I did that to you" she said as she kissed him again.</p> <p>"You're not sorry I have been fucked?" he laughed as he kissed her. "No. You're just a special woman." They both laughed out loud.</p> <p>"You know that you're not a special woman" she laughed at him again, "but I sure didn't mean it that way. If it was the first time you'd had sex in a long time, you're welcome", she said.</p> <p>"No it wasn't" he answered.</p> <p>"Are you going to stop me now?" she asked.</p> <p>"No", he replied. "I'm going to be gentle. We might just get together again."</p> <p>"You know", she said. "If you could, we could. We might even be friends." They laughed again.</p> <p>"I'd like to see my best friend make love to me", he said. "I certainly would. But, since you're not my best friend anymore, I'd still like to be friends." He kissed her again.
