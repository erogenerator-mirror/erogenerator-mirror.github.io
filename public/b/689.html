The first thing they did when they arrived at the resort was get naked and into the pool. After their meal, they would go grab some towels and head straight for the shower. During the drive up (about half an hour), they talked, and she admitted that her husband had an affair and was planning to leave her. After telling him (about the only part of their conversation that he knew), he would have to listen to her, but would not see her. They finally arrived at the resort and paid for everything on the way, including themselves.</p> <p>During the three weeks they had been seeing each other, he had come home with a dozen roses for her. He had bought a dozen roses for her during their first weekend together, in fact! The roses were very special, a treat.</p> <p>She said that she had no problem if he just bought roses and then brought them home. She didn't even think that he really intended to buy them. They had already exchanged telephone numbers and exchanged e-mail addresses. As much as she liked the way his cock felt when she was on top of him, that evening had been one of the best sex she had ever had with anything.</p> <p>After breakfast and then spending the better part of the morning nude, they returned to their suite, and he removed all of the clothes they had left on the bed. He had bought a white, silk bathrobe as an appetizer, so they would have to be naked as they descended the steps and then began to climb into the bath. He didn't care that they were naked, though, he simply turned the hot water on, and they both entered the bath. It was very warm (about a hundred degrees Fahrenheit – maybe a little lower) and both of them got in the bath.</p> <p>After a few moments soaking in the tub, which was really nice for them, they stepped outside and dried each other off. Then they turned off the light, and went back into the bedroom. When they were ready, he sat on the side of the bed, picked up the towels, and dried himself. Then he sat on the bed with them and took his clothes off. He was naked beneath them; he hadn't been without a hard-on since they arrived - until now.</p> <p>As they lay down on the bed, she reached her hand for her pussy, and slowly rubbed it. After a bit, she put her hand back down and resumed rubbing her pussy. Then she moved her hand over her breasts and played with her nipples, and she started to move her hips with her hand movements. She closed her eyes and felt the pleasure of his hands all over her and when she opened her eyes, she was pleased that she couldn't remember ever being so turned on.</p> <p>He removed his towel, moved between her legs, and said, "You're ready for me now, and I'll be right back."</p> <p>When he returned, she was lying on her back. He knelt over her, and put his cock at the entrance of her pussy. When she felt the head part her lips, he began sliding his now half-erect shaft into her.</p> <p>When he felt his balls touch her, she opened her eyes and said, "I am ready for you."</p> <p>He paused, then said, "I want you to see me while I fuck you. Do you want to watch me watch you? I can tell."</p> <p>She rolled her eyes and nodded her head. He continued sliding in and out of her.</p> <p>"Watch," he said with a knowing smile and a laugh.</p> <p>She looked into his eyes and then down to his penis as it went in and out of her, making her body shiver and make her pussy squeeze his cock. He continued moving in and out of her, and they moved their bodies along the bed, feeling each other and playing with the other's breasts, but most of all, they listened to each other's breathing.</p> <p>When he started to feel his orgasm approaching, she said "I'm almost there. Do you want us to fuck? I want you to know I am ready."</p> <p>"Well, we will," he replied.</p> <p>"I want you to keep going, darling."</p> <p>"I want to make you feel so good. It is so good that it will never end."</p> <p>That last was true. They began to move together, pushing their hips up against each other as he pushed his body up and down inside her. He felt his legs begin to stiffen, then he began to moan as he felt himself climax. He felt that pressure building inside him.</p> <p>He looked over at her as he finished. He was looking into her eyes, which were staring right down at him as he continued to penetrate her. He reached his hands up to her breasts, gently cupping them—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
