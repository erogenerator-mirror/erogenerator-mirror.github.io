I sat on the edge of the bed and spread my legs. There was an obscene, wet smudge on my panties, and it made me wince.</p> <p>"I'm scared," I said finally. "Please—I know I'm a virgin."</p> <p>"Oh, God, no." His voice was cold, a little voice from years past, but my panties were off now, and I could see the blood pounding in his ears. "You're supposed to be a great girl, you know. You have to stay at home and have fun with your friends. But I'd sure do it!" I was trembling, and I needed time to think and decide. He'd have to be the one to initiate the whole thing. And if he didn't, I was out of my league.</p> <p>He leaned forward and put his fingers under my chin, tilting my head up and looking deep into my eyes. There was something fierce in that stare. It was hard, hard to put into words. It was like those dark eyes of his were boring into me, and I knew what it meant. If my father ever saw that look on my face, the rest of my life would be forever ruined. And maybe with the kind of bad luck that could happen to us, there really would be some good luck.</p> <p>With that thought, he bent his head and kissed my lips, deeply and lusty, and then slipped his tongue between my lips.</p> <p>I don't think he'd given me much time to think it, and his kiss was unlike anything I'd ever experienced.</p> <p>"Are you sure, honey, about this little thing?"</p> <p>He reached out and pinched my chin so hard it hurt. "What do you think, my dear? Do we have a deal?" He smiled down at me. "Do you want to stay with your friends all day? I'll even let you pick a girl, if you want. Is that all right?"</p> <p>"Yes," I said, "It certainly is. I have nothing to hide, and I've even done some of those things with you at one of the parties. And I'm not even sure how to get out of it, not until you agree, you know. And you're so good at that!" "Well, I should be the one letting you down," his voice was all-but-sultry.</p> <p>Oh, God," I thought. "He's playing with me, what the hell is wrong with him? "</p> <p>And suddenly I realized that not only had we been married for so long, but he could be very, very hot in school, very passionate in bed, very persuasive, and his hands—and he could be gentle—were all over me.</p> <p>I looked over at him and said, "I'd be happy to stay with you, daddy. I know you want to, but—."</p> <p>He leaned towards me, putting a finger to my lips to stop me. "No, nothing, little girl, nothing!" He leaned down again, putting his arms around me, and then laid his face over mine. "Let's get this party started. I'd like to show you everything you really need to know."</p> <p>"I don't know," I said meekly, and he pressed his lips hard against mine. "I just need—I shouldn't be doing this."</p> <p>"It's all right, little girl, you should be ready to get out on your own."</p> <p>And he was right — there was little left to go home to. But not really, not really. And he wasn't even going to let me come out this late. I really was too young and naïve to understand what the right course of action was. We'd been together for a decade, now. Not a whole lot of time! And I had no one in my life.</p> <p>In a way, the more my father and I talked, the more it turned me on. It made me feel good, because I really wanted him. And I wanted to do things with him that I would like to do with someone as young as he was as well.</p> <p>But that wasn't the case at all. The things I wanted to do with him, the things I've wanted to do with him, the things I wanted to do to him, the things we had been going through together—it was just the idea that we were a couple. And that made me even more excited.</p> <p>After the first night I'd had in a long-term relationship, I had thought my father would want me all over again, or want—or love me for as—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
