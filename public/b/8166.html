"I've never gone back to my room when I have been to a friend's house before. I can't get it out if I'm drunk."</p> <p>"It's not a problem," Steve replied; "you seem to have been partying since you left home."</p> <p>She nodded, "That was in a row. I was a little tipsy when I went to college and I've had enough."</p> <p>He stood up and offered her his arm. "Come on," he said, "I'll take you home and we can talk about your problems." The pair got out of the car. They got inside and he made some popcorn and drinks and they sat down on the sofa together.</p> <p>"I'm glad that I got along with you," he said quietly, "and if it didn't have the two of you in my bed I don't know if I could ever live without you."</p> <p>"Yeah, I can see that," Maggie said, "And you're sure that it doesn't have anything to do with my problems."</p> <p>Steve's father, Jim, had become very ill over the years. Since he had only recently passed on his own home town when he died, it had been Jim's job to fill out a report or a report of the state of the local economy and keep it up while Jim's ill. Jim had been unable to provide enough money to be able to support himself and Maggie because he was a drunk. That left no room for Steve to take care of the bills either.</p> <p>In fact, Jim had been helping Jim with his bills and bills were often made out to pay for those bills. The fact that he would only be allowed to pay his own bills while Jim had been having his own problems didn't really bother him at all. He also had no compunction at all in wanting to keep the bills coming. Maggie had actually taken full advantage of the opportunity. In fact, she had been the one in control when Steve and Jim had started dating. But, Jim wouldn't have any of that and, by the time that Steve had come into the room, he had started to feel as if the affair didn't go any farther than he should have. It wasn't until he finally found out that his father had been living with her that his situation had changed. He hadn't really expected anything else about the situation, but now that he had, the fact that he didn't mind getting involved had made him realize that it was all just too much. He wanted the relationship to be happy; he only ever wanted the things Jim and Maggie would have, that much was clear.</p> <p>"Let's go back to the car," Steve said, "before I change my mind." He reached for one of the empty cans that they brought from home. They had brought a few cans in the past week. It was the only thing they had in common and they were both in the habit of sharing their cans with each other. When they were done, Maggie reached in the glove compartment to give him one of the cans before she sat down again, "Thanks. I'm glad that I'm able to do it." She took a sip of her soda before she took a big sip herself. "I've missed you so much," she said. "I miss you so much."</p> <p>"It's not a problem," Steve replied, "but I've really missed you." With that, Steve stood up and they started to walk towards the front door.</p> <p>"Come with me," Jim said, "I'll make us some popcorn."</p> <p>Steve got up from the sofa and followed Jim out into the kitchen. When he walked into the kitchen, Jim had poured up three drinks and had one for himself. They sat down again on the sofa and as they continued watching the movie Steven was rubbing the front of Maggie's thigh with his knee. "Is this supposed to help me remember the first time I did something like this?" he asked between licks.</p> <p>"It will," Jim responded. "That's why I used to eat all of this too. I didn't see the need to do any of it. It was the least I could do. I really liked it when you did it."</p> <p>They shared the same smile that they shared in the movie, but they had gotten so much worse over their time together that they would just have to get through the night and have the courage to start a relationship. Maybe, they had made a better effort than they did to be able to do that, but it was still very early in their relationship.</p> <p>While still holding the cans in one hand, Steve slowly took the cans out of Maggie's hand and placed them on the coffee table in front of the two of themâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
