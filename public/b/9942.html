"You're so pretty." She smiled and blew him a kiss. "Thanks." And then she was gone.</p> <p>"What about you," he said softly as he stepped into the shower and then stood there for a moment. "Do your hair still look good?"</p> <p>"Oh, I guess sometimes it does," she said as she washed her hair. "I still think it looks good, that's all. I always liked the color."</p> <p>He nodded and soaped his body and then he reached under the water to stroke her body.</p> <p>"I've never used a razor this way," she whispered. Not in that tone of voice that she'd worn over the years. "I thought it would be too rough."</p> <p>He felt a little guilty. He couldn't see her shaving her pubic hair and so he just nodded. Then he reached and rinsed his hair and rinsed it dry.</p> <p>"Do you still have your bathrobe?" she asked as she stepped out of the shower to wrap the bathrobe around herself.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm in the bedroom."</p> <p>"Good," she said as she dried her hair and looked at him. "But I'm really pretty naked."</p> <p>"What do you think?" He said and took her face between his large hands. "You're even more beautiful to me. I never get tired of looking at you."</p> <p>"I'm glad you think so," she said as she ran her fingers through his wet hair.</p> <p>"I have no idea what you think," he said with a laugh and pulled her in for a kiss as he pulled the towel tightly around himself. "Let's get you out of those robe's wet." She just smiled as she went to get him the bathrobe. "There's no hurry," she said as she got inside and shut the door. "I'll finish and come back in a few minutes."</p> <p>"I'll be right out," he replied as he stepped out of the door and then looked at her standing there in the wet bathrobe.</p> <p>"Thanks," she smiled and then walked out to the bed.</p> <p>He just stood there for a moment until she came in front of him. He was so embarrassed right then when she saw his erection standing up. "You have a really nice one," she said and then turned to face him. "You really are pretty."</p> <p>"Thanks," he said and then he stepped forward and kissed her hard.</p> <p>"It feels so good when you kiss me like this," she whispered as her tongue probed his mouth.</p> <p>He was suddenly aware of the warm water running on him. "This feels wonderful, Sarah." And then he kissed her hard again, and then she pulled him closer to her and her legs spread open even wider. "Oh, God, I just love the way you kiss me like that," he moaned as his erection pushed against her.</p> <p>She felt so amazing, so completely female. She was so beautiful to him. His erection pressed against her and he could feel the wetness coming out of her and she lifted her upper leg to put it around his waist and then wrapped it around his own. They kissed again and he felt her body shudder and she giggled. 'I think we should have done this a long time ago," she smiled as he reached down and ran his fingers through her pubic hair. "Do you want me to shave this or is this too hard?"</p> <p>"I think it's wonderful," he whispered as he took her nipple between his fingers and gently rolled it. "It feels good, I feel good," he sighed as he rolled and then pinched the other.</p> <p>When she moaned again, he slipped the tip of his index finger between the lips that were wet and swollen. But he had no intention of shaving anything but that as he rubbed his hard shaft against the top of her vagina. "Oh, I know how much your thing likes this," she purred and then reached down and grabbed him and guided it into her.</p> <p>Then she moaned as he slid into her. She was completely warm and slippery as he slipped his hips forward. "Oh, yes," she moaned and held him to her more tightly. Then her legs tightened and her hand slipped away from his.</p> <p>"I love you," she whispered. "We are very close together."</p> <p>"I love you too," he said and then kissed her again. "But we are so close as a family."</p> <p>"I know," she whispered. "It feels good too." But it was so hot and sexy.
