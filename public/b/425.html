I knelt between her legs.</p> <p>"Okay, let's play a little." I reached out and started running my fingertips lightly over her pussy with my left hand, first one, then the other hand, to find it wet and throbbing.</p> <p>"You're dripping," I commented.</p> <p>"You're not going to let me catch my breath?"</p> <p>"It didn't really make your pussy throb like that? You might be surprised."</p> <p>"Yes, it makes my pussy ache a little."</p> <p>"Can you tell how excited I am?"</p> <p>"Not really, but sometimes it's the same. I'm pretty horny."</p> <p>"Then maybe you're excited."</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm sure you could tell."</p> <p>She started lightly tugging at my cock again, as if it was a new toy. It did make me ache but not enough that I had to come back.</p> <p>"How about a little tongue action? Just rub your tongue over my pussy and get my juices flowing," she pleaded.</p> <p>"Okay, but only for a little while," I answered, and slid up her body.</p> <p>"I can't wait. But before we do anything, I want you to kiss me there. I've never kissed anyone before. It might be a little awkward but it's nice."</p> <p>I lowered myself to her mouth, my tongue moving over hers, as the two of us kissed. We kissed for several minutes as she massaged my testicles and started sucking on my tongue, like she was trying to memorize it. She broke the kiss to get to her crotch which was already as moist as her pussy. When I pulled my tongue from her mouth, she opened her mouth and offered me her mouth. I leaned down to kiss her and then she did the same, tasting herself on my lips. It was nice, as I've only kissed girls and other women in a few years, but I wanted to do more. I slid my tongue into her mouth.</p> <p>We held each other for a few minutes as we kissed. I could feel her hands on my chest, one rubbing and playing with my nipples. She moved down to my cock and started licking me. As my pre-ejaculation fluid lubricated her tongue, I could feel the wetness in her mouth and in her mouth. The two of us kissed for several minutes. When she let go of my cock, her face looked flushed.</p> <p>"I'm thirsty," she finally said, "How about we go to the shower?"</p> <p>"I think that might be the best thing to do," I replied.</p> <p>"I just hope your dad doesn't mind. I wish he can get this out of his system."</p> <p>My parents weren't home when we got up. And once again, I told my mother how much I loved her and was going to keep it real quiet. She accepted that, with a little grin, but told me, "Be a good boy, Tommy, and take care of Mommy." And she kissed me goodnight.</p> <p>Once out of the bathroom, she was back on the bed, and I quickly stripped. I got in on the same side that she, too, had and started licking her pussy. Her hands came up to her pussy and she started rubbing my face where mine had been. I continued licking her, my mouth now wet from how wet she was.</p> <p>"I loved sucking on you from last night, Tommy," I said, my voice catching as her pussy started getting wetter from my attention to her.</p> <p>"You were amazing," she answered, as I stopped licking her. And we both blushed again.</p> <p>"I thought it was that good," she said. "I've never felt like this before. Thank you."</p> <p>"I think Mom and Dad have a pretty good understanding about how to make a man feel good. The one thing that is even more common in the bedroom is to eat pussy out," I explained.</p> <p>"Can you show me?"</p> <p>We kissed again and I was back in the drawer with what looked like lipsticks. I slipped it over her pussy and was surprised to see how smooth it felt. I was about to kiss it when she held my head.</p> <p>"Wait a second before you kiss it again. I won't taste what you just used to," she advised.</p> <p>"Okay, but give me the tip."</p> <p>I leaned down and began stroking the fake-smoothness against her clit. She squirmed and ground the headâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
