This is not going to make your life a miserable one. It won't change anything. I could get you killed if you ever tried to run me down. You didn't take my life, you didn't beat me up, you didn't physically hurt me, you didn't put any bruises on me, and you took it all apart like the good cop you are."</p> <p>His eyes were now glistening from both tears of loss and anger. "I don't understand."</p> <p>He looked at her hard, her face in his hands and felt her take another small step back. "What do you want?"</p> <p>"For the next twenty years...we have no going back. We have a long way to go before I have to give up my freedom if for nothing we have to run this country together."</p> <p>"That's fair," he agreed.</p> <p>"What do you want?" she asked again.</p> <p>"For the next fifty years you go wherever you want."</p> <p>"All right. I get it."</p> <p>He stood up and picked her up in his arms, pulling her down the hallway towards the bedroom. "Come on, love, make me a drink."</p> <p>She followed him, still holding on to him tightly. He turned off the lights and kicked off his shoes and wrapped her up in the sheets. She moaned, she wanted him to take her, to be inside her. She was going to do anything he wanted, anything.</p> <p>*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p> <p>Once they got upstairs, he let her go first and went on the first landing to find their bedroom door locked behind them. He went in and locked the door behind them. He sat on the edge of the bed and kissed her lips, running his tongue along them. When he pulled back he smiled when she smiled back. "I'm going to enjoy this. But you're first."</p> <p>"I'm glad you like it," she said, leaning back onto his chest.</p> <p>He smiled and pulled her into his arms. Pulling her close, letting his hands roam her body, he started to nibble at her neck. She leaned her head back, letting her hair cascade down, feeling his lips, his breath on her skin, his skin. He kissed her, making her wet with desire for him. His tongue explored her lips, touching her tongue with his...she had never felt anything like him before. She felt as if she were in a dream, just being there.</p> <p>His fingers ran along her spine, feeling her pulse. Running along her shoulders, running down her back. She melted into his embrace as much as he did. His tongue flicked over the top of her ear, kissing it softly. He slipped his fingers down to her belly and started running them along her inner thigh, sliding them across the lips of her pussy, feeling the softness of her bush underneath. He slid his fingers back up and stroked her again, feeling the slick juice running out, the warmth of her skin in his fingers.</p> <p>"I've been wanting to touch you all this time," he whispered.</p> <p>"Then give me a couple of those things I mentioned earlier," she said.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Put them on. I want to see you do it. Put the things on, love."</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"This time, I'm going to do it slowly."</p> <p>"Yes I am." He slipped his fingers under the towel she had wrapped around herself, cupping his fingers between her legs. He ran his fingers up and down along the slit of the lips, feeling how it turned her on, how it made him want it to so badly that his own desire to do what he wanted was getting to him again. His fingers stroked her again, feeling the smoothness of her pussy, the softness of her skin, feeling her respond to his touch. Their bodies felt connected with each other. He felt like he was touching her, like she was him. He wanted to feel how she felt when she was all that she was to him, as he was touching her. His voice had deepened with her moans.</p> <p>"I always knew it would be you. Never you."</p> <p>He watched her eyes watch him as he continued stroking his fingers, feeling her juices flowing across his fingers. He slid a finger onto her clit, feeling the little bud of flesh. He sucked his finger into his mouth as he continued circling her clit with his finger. He moved his mouth up and he sucked her clit in his mouth, feeling her body twitch and shake.
