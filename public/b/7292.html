"Now that you're a part of the family, where do you want to be?"</p> <p>"Oh Daddy, anything," she said softly.</p> <p>"Anything?" I asked, a little surprised. "Anything for you?"</p> <p>"Anything," she said. I smiled at her, pleased with myself.</p> <p>"Anything," I smiled back at her. We continued our conversation in other ways, sometimes she would have me stay for an extra long session, sometimes we would use the pool together just outside the house. We kissed a couple of times, but always by accident.</p> <p>It was time to move on, I had to figure out some way to make my daughter happy. I knew I couldn't stay the same with her for a long time. At the same time, I didn't want to leave to a difficult situation. "Can I think about it for a day or two?"</p> <p>She shook her head. "It is my first day at school, so I want to be comfortable around you, I think we will be fine."</p> <p>"Okay, I'll take that chance," I said.</p> <p>**********</p> <p>I was surprised at how much I enjoyed being a part of the family. I had been with friends, and family of friends for almost four years before I came into the world. I hadn't really been in the know, and I didn't think there was much in the way to be different. In fact, I had been a bit of an outsider, even a bit of a tease. I suppose that I could have continued with my family life, but I didn't.</p> <p>The fact is there was something else, and although I was more attracted to the beautiful, beautiful, sexy Mrs. Lott, I thought that there might be something missing. I looked out the window in the backyard, trying to see what she was thinking. Then, I saw it, and I realized that I was staring at her.</p> <p>"Mom, are you okay?" I whispered.</p> <p>"Hmm?" She asked, then she realized she had been looking up and down my body.</p> <p>"What is it there, Mom."</p> <p>Her face lit up, I'm sure I was being as inconspicuous as possible while she stared. "Sorry, honey," she said. That sent a warm feeling through me, and I wondered if I was seeing that beautiful, sexy mother and her wonderful son. Oh yeah, just the picture, right there in my mind's eye.</p> <p>After a few minutes pause, she looked down at her breasts, which were just barely contained in the thin, tight white shirt. It came as a great shock. I wondered if this was a new phase for her, because she was a lot like her mother. I wondered who had made the decision to raise a son with the same genes that I did.</p> <p>"Sorry, mom, I'm embarrassed. It's just that, uhm, your breasts are so big and...and, um, so firm and..."</p> <p>"Honey," she said in a voice that was both soft and playful. "It's okay to stare, but don't you dare put your hands in your lap."</p> <p>"That's okay, Mom, I don't mind, and I don't mind at all," I said. She just smiled, and continued staring at me.</p> <p>"So are you going to join me for a swim?" she asked.</p> <p>"Um, sure, Mom, if you do. It's your house, right?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah," she responded, a little surprised at my willingness to let my parents see my body. If not me, then others too?</p> <p>"Yeah, I suppose so. It is sort of late, I guess around nine anyway," I said.</p> <p>"I better go," she said.</p> <p>"Okay, but I don't mind," I said, not really wanting to be alone.</p> <p>"Okay, uh, yes," she said.</p> <p>I finished swimming, and went and sat on her couch while she put on some shorts. I decided to come out and swim. She wanted to join me and use the pool before turning in early after a long day.</p> <p>"So, how long have I been sitting there?" she asked.</p> <p>"Since I saw your picture and realized I was looking at you," I said.</p> <p>"Honey, I don't know if I can."</p> <p>"Sure, of course you can, let's go see what's around the house and see if we can catch your eye," I said, not believing what I was hearing next.
