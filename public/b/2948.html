We ate and made small talk. When we were done I said, "Honey I didn't call that far."</p> <p>"No, it was a long time that I was away." I turned a little red at the question. I had never seen him this red and I was having trouble sitting still.</p> <p>"Yes, I've had this talk with that." He said as we left the table. I asked him if they could work out a meeting for him this morning. He agreed and we left.</p> <p>I waited until they left and then went to my room and showered and dressed. When I came back up to my room and I stripped and got dressed. I was a naked beauty. I was a real knockout, in my early forties I had lost all my hair. I turned to my vanity mirror and put on some makeup. Then I went to the mirror.</p> <p>I looked at myself. The face, but not in my best looking way. I put my hair in two pigtails that came up to the middle of my back. I put on bright red lipstick and my hair stood up in the morning. I picked out my outfit, "Hair Ball", a white button-up blouse with a short skirt on, and my black and white check shoes with four small ankle straps and two 5 inch heels completed the outfit.</p> <p>I had on sheer red stockings and a pair of short plaid slacks, with a pink blouse. The hem was not too short. I sat down on the edge of my vanity desk and started to type. I could see that Mark was staring at me and I felt his hands slowly sliding up my legs. It felt so good. "It will take longer to cum." I thought.</p> <p>When he came up and pushed me back, I just slid down a little, resting on my hands and knees, the front of my skirt now up and my blouse half way up to my breasts. "Hurry." I said as I looked up at him. He moved a little closer to me and started kissing me. His lips were wet with our kissing. I put my arms around his neck and ran my hands all over his body. The touch of his soft lips and the feel of his shirt on my skin sent electric shivers over and through my body. I felt his hands move to my skirt and slowly slid it down. I was glad it took off, he liked what he saw. I could tell by the little gasp of the button that my skirt went to the floor and I stood naked before him. He put his hands on my breasts and kissed them as my skirt dropped to the floor exposing my already naked body.</p> <p>He was wearing no underwear and his cock sprang into my hands as my hands slid along his firm legs. I ran my hand slowly up the inside of his leg and my finger went to the slit of his cock. It had been a while since I'd had a cock in my hand and even longer since I had a man's cock. His cock was so hard and big that it felt like glass as it sprang into my hand. He was so hard. I took my cock and put the head in my mouth. I licked it several times. "Oh God" He gasped,"I just about took your clothes off before you went to sleep."</p> <p>I slid my body down his so that his body was over my and his cock was deep in my mouth. I sucked and tongued his cock and balls to the back of my mouth. I slid my mouth back and forth on him. I could felt him tense and start breathing harder, he said "Hurry, I'm going to cum any second now." He thrust his hips and forced my head down his cock. My nose became tickle and I had to open my eyes just to keep from being caught in his intense face.</p> <p>He had not wanted to cum. He wanted to last as long as possible. I pulled away from his cock and sat up. His cock was still in my mouth and he lay there letting out a huge breath.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum." I whispered to him and I stood up. I quickly stripped off my panties, I held my legs open and I could feel the wetness. I stepped into the tub and lay on my back. I opened a bottle of wine and poured a glass.</p> <p>"Honey, you know you are the prettiest thing I've ever seen." He said to me as he got into the tub next to me. I smiled and sat up to join him on the edge of the tub. I put my arms around his neck and kissed him deeply tasting my mouth on his tongue.</p> <p>He started sliding his hands up my legs, and I ran my fingers through his hair as he started sliding his hand up my legs.
