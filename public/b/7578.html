I leaned over and put a finger under her chin, tilting her face upward. She leaned in toward me as she saw my eyes glancing down from above. She took a deep breath, and I noticed her mouth had gone dry. There wasn't anything I couldn't see, and I could smell the faint scent of her perfume.</p> <p>My eyes had finally traveled down to those lush, full lips... I wanted to run my fingers through them. She had them pressed tightly together, and they were parted slightly, leaving little wet trails in their wake. I reached around and cupped her left breast, feeling for the hardening tip through the thin fabric of her dress. I felt little bumps in the fabric, and then I pinched her nipple gently, sending a shiver through her. She squirmed a bit herself, and her breasts bounced a bit as she did. With both hands, I pulled her dress up around her shoulders while I cupped her breasts. Her nipples were puckered and stiff, erect and pointy.</p> <p>"Mmm," she moaned, "You're beautiful, and these lips... I can't wait any longer..." she murmured, reaching for my hand, and placing it on her right breast. I massaged it, using my soft, caressing hand, while she continued to rub her thigh up and down my leg, which I couldn't help but notice that she wasn't wearing any panties.</p> <p>My finger slid down her slit to her clit, and she moaned again and bit her lip while she ground herself against me. She was wet and ready to be had, and I wanted to be inside her right then and there. While my finger touched and ran back and forth over her clit and lips, I slid two fingers into her and began to pump them in and out. She started bucking against my hand, and I watched my fingers sinking in and out of her. Each time she bucked against me, I let my thumb begin working her clit, which made her legs start to tremble. Her mouth parted a little further, and her breath came out in sharp gasps.</p> <p>"Oh, my... Oh... Oh my..." she whispered, gasping at the thought of being so thoroughly filled. "You're going to make me come... I can feel it... I need to come..."</p> <p>I reached up and grabbed her right tit, squeezing it roughly when I did. She closed her eyes, biting her lip and gasping out softly when to pull herself away again, which only made my thumb work her harder. I could feel the heat and her walls, contracting tight in rhythm with my stroking, and as she shook and trembled, I knew she was close, as well. Her face was a mask of complete pleasure. She continued to tremble, and I felt her pussy pulsate around me...</p> <p>"Oh... Oh... Oh!"</p> <p>And the first wave hit her, and her entire body went rigid before beginning to spasm in a huge wave of shuddering waves. It was all I could do to keep from sinking my fangs into the back of hers. Her body shook as she rode it, and her moans were coming out of her mouth and over my hand, and her eyes screwed shut as if trying to see what happened.</p> <p>When I had finished, she opened her eyes, and looked around, all befuddled and dazed. She smiled, and I saw how her teeth had grown back, but left only in the back between her perfect teeth. She was staring at me, as if waiting for me to say something... which I didn't think would come.</p> <p>"Shoot it," she said softly, "shoot it." She looked at my hand. "Do you have the condom?" she asked. I just shook my head, and took the packet out of my purse. She quickly threw it into the open seat seat and ran around, where I quickly took the condom on, and we were on our way.</p> <p>We got into the front of the limo, which I had brought down from the back. The chauffeur waved when we were close, and got off with a wave, then turned around and disappeared into the darkness.</p> <p>"It's not like you," I whispered, "that would just have happened to me." Her hand slowly slid over her nipple, and she watched me carefully. I could feel the soft, plump, swelling of her breast in my palm.</p> <p>It turned out we found a parking space in a large block of buildings. I parked, and helped her get out and get out. "You should have brought that, too," she said as she handed me the condom.
