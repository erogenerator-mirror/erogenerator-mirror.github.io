Please have another drink as my Mistress tells me it's my turn. "</p> <p>Mistress took a drink and asked</p> <p>"Is our relationship here in public here? Mistress, that's a bold way. I don't know if there is any sexual conduct within your organization that I should mention, "</p> <p>My Mistress seemed to notice that I hadn't taken my eyes of her, as she brought her drink to my lips, I took a drink.</p> <p>"Is our relationship here in public here? Mistress, may I have another drink or two? Mistress, your Mistress desires to offer her drink to us, is this acceptable?</p> <p>Mistress was getting more bolder and bolder, as she told</p> <p>"It's okay as is here in private here, "</p> <p>I knew she meant that this would be my drink, but, "yes", I thought, she also knew that.</p> <p>She had been giving me a few tokes since we started the dance, so, she took a drink and told me not to worry or put it away.</p> <p>At that time, as her drink was a bit low, she told me that it was my turn to have yet another drink.</p> <p>I drank it and drank it again, I could feel my nipples getting hard and my pussy lips spreading apart.</p> <p>Mistress ordered</p> <p>"Sit." She turned around. I got back on my back. Her drink had done a bit more to me and I felt a little bit dizzy.</p> <p>Mistress told me to tell her that I was a slut, and that I was a little slut. I said that I was.</p> <p>She then told me to tell my Mistress, that we are going to see how much slut I have become.</p> <p>I was feeling a little more relaxed.</p> <p>"That's better." She said.</p> <p>Her voice was a bit deeper. I didn't know why, but, I was getting a little aroused from her voice. To my surprise, I felt a little wetness between my legs.</p> <p>My legs were spread apart and my pussy moistened. My nipples were tingling with excitement, as I told her.</p> <p>Mistress leaned over to me and started to kiss me, which caused my nipples to tingle with excitement.</p> <p>Mistress asked</p> <p>"Do you really get excited from thinking about other women, when you are out running with other men?"</p> <p>I didn't reply. I just mumbled yes. Mistress pulled away, as she looked back over at the monitor, I was now the center of attention.</p> <p>Mistress continued</p> <p>"Do you really get excited thinking about other men?" Mistress asked again. Again, I just mumbled yes.</p> <p>Mistress was still leaning over me, as she rubbed my bare shoulders and breasts with her hands. I felt so exposed and slutty being on display like this.</p> <p>Mistress then said,</p> <p>"Do you really get turned on that much, when watching porn together, as we danced?"</p> <p>I couldn't answer the question. I am sure that someone could hear or hear us, and that a large part of my audience could hear us.</p> <p>Mistress then got off of my lap and stood up. She walked slowly over to the monitors.</p> <p>She then looked back at the monitor,</p> <p>"Have you noticed that there is a larger portion on this screen that is showing your slave?"</p> <p>I nodded and mumbled yes.</p> <p>Mistress laughed, as she said</p> <p>"Does a good slut do that?"</p> <p>She then placed two fingers into my cunt and told me</p> <p>"This cock cage will keep yours nice and hard so that you only get excited."</p> <p>Before I could answer, she put her thumbs in the waistband of some cotton underwear, and pulled them off over my head.</p> <p>Mistress then told me to remove the panties and let them drop. I didn't bother to resist. I wanted to see her naked for myself.</p> <p>Mistress lifted each leg up slightly and showed me her shaved pussy which was almost bald.</p> <p>Mistress then told me to kneel down, as she moved back toward the wall of the dance room.</p> <p>She started to rub my shoulders and shoulders. My cunt was starting to get warmer. I could feel that my juices were starting to leak onto the bed.</p> <p>Mistress started to kiss down my neck. With her lips softly touching me, I can feel her warm breath on my neck and ear where her warm breath and warm breath send shivers through my body.</p> <p>Mistressâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
