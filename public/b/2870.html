And then she smiled and got to her feet, leaving her son alone.</p> <p>"Well, you have a nice day." she said, grinning at him. "But right now I think you owe me a good workout."</p> <p>"Yes!" he responded, looking down.</p> <p>She gave his cock a gentle squeeze and giggled as she walked away, smiling widely as she did so.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>She stopped right outside the door of the house.</p> <p>"So, how was the pool party?" she asked, as she walked toward him. "How was...?" her voice trailed off, as she came back.</p> <p>"Wow." he said, taking in her naked, curvy body. Her body was flawless, with the only trace of tanning gone. Her full breasts were a bit fuller than average, probably a natural DD. Her hips and thighs were trim. Her breasts were definitely natural. Her smile was sweet, as were her eyes. Her shoulders were slender, as was her bust.</p> <p>"That was amazing." she said, staring into his eyes. Her voice was sweet.</p> <p>"It was indeed!"</p> <p>She reached out to give his cock a strong squeeze. Her touch was magical. A warm rush of liquid rushed through his body, causing his breath to catch in his throat. Her smile was sweet. Her fingers closed around his cock, gently cupping his testicles. He nearly came in her hands in her excited excitement.</p> <p>"You have a wonderful cock."she said, as she began to stroke him up and down.</p> <p>"If I get... to much help, how about you stay the night and you help me clean up?"</p> <p>"You know I would!" she said, grinning at him. Her hand moved back to his cock, now a semi-erect, and she stood up. Her fingers wrapped around his cock, and she held it lightly while looking down at him with those beautiful, blue eyes. She took his hand and pulled him from the pool, holding it while he stepped out. She helped him out of the water, and then stood up in the doorway of the kitchen, next to her son on the couch. She lifted her arms above her head, causing her breasts to rise slightly. She smiled when she saw his eyes follow her. She pulled his hand up to her mouth. A small, pink tongue came out to lick her palm. He took that as a yes to kiss her. Their lips met, and their tongues explored each other's mouths. Their breathing rapidly increased.</p> <p>He lifted her to her feet, and she gently laid him down on the couch. He sat up on his back, allowing her to drop on top of him. Her breasts were firm, with large erect nipples. His hands caressed and kneaded her breasts while she looked deep into his eyes with a mischievous expression, still lightly rubbing across his cock to get it hard.</p> <p>"I think there's more than enough for both of us to play with." she said, smiling at him as she lowered herself down onto him. He lay there, letting her do all the work, as their bodies writhed together. They had the occasional kiss, or lick, as they did just that, but that was all they were doing right now. Nothing more. Nothing more. They knew that.</p> <p>She was completely in charge. As far as she was concerned, she wanted to make him feel better than he had felt before. He opened his eyes and looked up to see that she had pulled her lips off his cock and was watching intently her hand moving up and down his shaft.</p> <p>She smiled and leaned down, kissing him again before getting up again. She wrapped her mouth around his cock once more. She was good, as far as she was concerned. She slid her lips up and down his shaft, in and out, with an enthusiastic rhythm, as she continued doing the same movements she had been doing with her own hand.</p> <p>"Mmmmhh," she said at her own pace, moaning a bit each time she made a trip up and down his hard dick. "That feels incredible."</p> <p>He looked at her face looking up at him. Her eyes were closed. He leaned up and kissed her, which she returned. She kept right on going, going from his rock-hard cock, all the way up to his chin, her eyes locking onto his. She slid more of her tongue out, tasting him a bit, and smiled again.</p> <p>"You taste sweet," she said, looking into his eyes again.</p> <p>"Yeah..." he said.</p> <p>She grinned at him again, this time a bit more mischievously, as sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
