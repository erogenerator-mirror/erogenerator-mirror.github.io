I panted back, my chest heaving as I tried to gain control over myself.</p> <p>"Don't be a bitch, I will get you." He pulled me to him, then pinned me against the nearest wall. He lowered to his knees in front of me as he looked directly into my eyes; then kissed me in a fierce kiss that didn't leave any doubt about what he wanted. I couldn't move while I was in this state of passion.</p> <p>"I want to take you..." he said, his words almost pleading, "I need to feel your warm body around my dick..." his breath on my ear made me shiver and I could tell that he was very turned on right now. I couldn't believe it; I wanted this man. My body needed this man. At that moment, my breath left me in a whoosh.</p> <p>"Tell me you have a choice." He whispered into my ear. "Either take me in your hand, or have this hard fucking dick... whatever, to give you the fucking of your young life!" he laughed at his last line and I didn't know how to respond to it at first, but he couldn't control himself, I'm such a little bitch and I'm sooo turned on, but I want to feel the hard dick of someone of power, right here against me.</p> <p>I bit my lip as I slowly pulled his shirt off and he threw it aside, his face was so close and I could smell his scent so well. I ran my hands down his chest, to his hips, his hard dick and I rubbed it a bit before I knelt up and took him in my mouth. His hands were entwined in my hair as he leaned back in the wall, breathing very hard. I heard him moan as I started sliding up and down his shaft like a piston. I could taste the saltiness of his cum in my mouth, I could feel the heat as I slid up and down his hard cock. I could hear his sighing with each stroke as I slid up and down, I could feel my own breathing coming in ragged gasps now and again.</p> <p>With one hand on my head, he pulled me down to his dick and I moaned as I took him completely in. His breathing was deep and raspy as he pulled my head off and kissed me with a passion I had never felt before.</p> <p>His tongue entered my mouth with a fervor that made me jump, my mouth opened automatically and I moaned as this stranger had my body, my thoughts, my soul...</p> <p>"Shit!" I heard a door slamming shut. I couldn't believe it, this was actually happening. I looked down to see her in the doorway, it was my mom.</p> <p>"Oh shit, I didn't know it was going on in here!"</p> <p>"Well, we can't have you leaving like this, so now are you going into the tub or me?" Mom asked and she had her dress torn and her tits hanging out and her dress had a wet spot on one side, the wet spot on the other side was a clear drop in her cleavage. I saw her staring into my eyes with hunger in them. "Honey, you don't have to get in the tub; you have a free pass... I'm on my way, see you in a minute, bye!" Mom said as she turned and left the door.</p> <p>It took me a second to comprehend everything just then, as I turned to kiss her I could feel her tongue against my lips first, then my throat. My cock stiffened in my pants as she touched me and I felt one of her hands caressing my ass. We broke our kiss in a kiss and then she kissed me, her lips were soft and sweet as she touched me and her lips tasted of a good, well, whiskey like I've always thought we would pick something that would give us the right to make passionate love all weekend long.</p> <p>The kiss was very soft and tender and I felt her hand slowly running down my back. I could feel her warmth as I felt her fingers playing under the ties of my suit. I could also sense her wetness as her hands felt my ass and she stroked me through my pants as she kissed me again. I could feel my dick getting hard as she stroked me and I could feel her wetness as she rubbed against it. I could feel her finger brushing against my balls through the material of my suit as I leaned against the wall and wrapped my arms around her, as we broke for air.</p> <p>I could smell her perfume on her neck and my dick began to throb, it felt even harder when she pulled me to the bed and turned me around. "Lie on your back, baby," she cooed as she took my dick in her hand and licked her lips as I watched herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
