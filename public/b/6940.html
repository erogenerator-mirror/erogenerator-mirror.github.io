"Oh, shit. The date is still three hours away."</p> <p>I took a slow step into an area of wood she had obviously built after the last time we made such an amazing mating. I held onto the branch, and walked over to her. She looked right at me, and I slowly walked backwards until I was beside her.</p> <p>The way her dress moved, the way her eyes moved, made my stomach tighten. We stayed like that for a few minutes with me staring at her, and her staring at me. I reached out and touched her arm gently. She stopped, and turned her head so I'd kiss her.</p> <p>She pulled back, and took a deep breath. "You were very nice to me."</p> <p>"Thanks. I hope you enjoyed yourself."</p> <p>"Well, thanks for the date. You're a great date. You really opened up a lot of possibilities for us."</p> <p>We kissed again, and this time she reached down and stroked my cock. "I think we should call it a night."</p> <p>"Ok." I was nervous as hell, but it felt so nice.</p> <p>*** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** ***</p> <p>I picked up the phone and began to text my girlfriend, "Sandra says they're looking for a couple guy!"</p> <p>"Uh-huh. Listen sweetie, I'm not sure what's going on here, but I'm willing to ask her. That's all I can tell you. She doesn't know it yet."</p> <p>"Oh. Well of course I'm not saying anything yet."</p> <p>"You're such a sweetie!" I sent back before the phone went dead.</p> <p>After a few moments of silence, Christina called out, "Hey babe. I got your text last night."</p> <p>"Yeah. I got your text this morning. Are you there?"</p> <p>"Yeah. Just thinking about you..."</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"Hey guys. It's been nice talking with you. My boyfriend and I have some really great sex. I really miss it, and he's a wonderful guy to mess with."</p> <p>"Hey, we were wondering if you'd like to see your roommate in action again?"</p> <p>"She's cute. She's an awesome girl, and a real nice guy who I've met, so yeah. And what about you and me?"</p> <p>"Yeah. I think we're having a very good time together. I thought we would go out this weekend. Can't you say that?" She said.</p> <p>"Yeah. It sounded pretty good, huh?"</p> <p>"Yeah, we were in the hot tub, and then we talked about how we wanted to make it the night."</p> <p>"Sounds promising."</p> <p>"Yeah, it sounds good," I replied. "You know, we haven't had that much time with each other. So how about you make yourself comfortable while we wait and see what happens."</p> <p>"Ok. I have a few ideas. Just let me know what you think. I'll let you decide."</p> <p>I texted her, "It's getting late, but I can be ready in half an hour."</p> <p>I didn't say anything back, so I just started walking toward the woods that led to the woods by the old cabin.</p> <p>"Wow. They're really coming back here."</p> <p>"Yep."</p> <p>I walked up the hill, stopped by a little log, and sat around the picnic table. I turned up the heat, made sure my phone was going off, then laid down and closed my eyes. That's when I suddenly realised that someone was getting my back. I jumped up, and checked my phone again. Oh my god! I'm back! I tried to go back in, but my friend had gone and called Christina. I turned to see what was happening, and was shocked to see Christina! Damn, she looks really hot. Damn, she had on a black leather skirt that accentuated her sexy legs. She was wearing a matching jacket and blouse that was buttoned off the top button, but I still could not believe how pretty she was. It even looked sexy as hell!</p> <p>"I was going to surprise you by doing something," she said, and I think she meant for me to do the same thing!</p> <p>"Well, you look good. I thought you were gonna surprise me, but now I really wanted to show you."</p> <p>I told her this, then turned to look at her face, I was hoping she would have noticed. After what felt like an eternity, I saw her turn and open her mouth, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
