I'm sorry to be rude."</p> <p>I was taken aback. I've never had a visitor ask if anyone was early while we were in here. She looked a little flushed, and quite frankly I wanted to grab her and ravage her right there. In front of all these strangers... with an audience of all. It was so strange, and yet I was so hard I almost thought that it was going to pop!</p> <p>"I'm sorry, we are late... I really shouldn't be waiting outside all by myself though!"</p> <p>"That's okay. We have plenty of time. We are here all the time. Come on, I'll buy you lunch, and you can help me get settled in. The door's always unlocked by the door, is that okay with you?"</p> <p>I couldn't think of anything to say, and tried to keep my voice calm. My heart was racing with fright, and I was still scared. I was not used to strangers seeing me like that. Yet I was completely nervous, and all at the same time, so I was not sure if she really wanted that or that I should tell him what had happened.</p> <p>"Sure, go ahead. I'll wait outside," she said with a smile.</p> <p>I followed her to the front door, and she opened the door and let me inside, not saying a word as I passed her room.</p> <p>I looked around the room, taking in every detail before getting a better look at where I had seen them all standing. There were two or three men, most were at least twice my age. One or two others were women, both dressed in dresses. I thought of a couple of friends of mine who had been caught in here, but were safe in here. I noticed a bed with two beds on it, with a dresser and a chair where someone could recline their own and enjoy their own time as they wished. I thought this must be one of the guest rooms. I looked about, searching for a bedroom with a bathroom and an ensuite, and I found one with curtains to keep people out of view from the front door.</p> <p>"What? What did they say? I thought they were just about to come."</p> <p>I looked over the rest of the room, noting that most of the furniture was taken from it. It looked like a room that could have doubled as a private bathroom. I could hear the people in the room moving around, talking, in the mirror.</p> <p>"It doesn't look like anything we have here does, not until I get closer!" she said with a laugh. "It looks like my friend here has a place!"</p> <p>I was about to ask more when I heard the woman in the mirror in the other room say something to her, and a figure came out of the mirror, and they all came into the room and began walking towards me.</p> <p>My cock stiffened, my lips suddenly felt dry, almost as though it was stuck in them, and all the blood was rushing through it. It was all I could do to keep from moving, but the women were all around me. My breath was still labored when the figure said something to her. She walked into the closet and turned on a light. I saw two men and two women who were sitting in an armchair, and they were looking over me. The figures moved towards the bed nearest to the mirror and pulled themselves all the way in.</p> <p>As my eyes adjusted to the light, I took a couple of steps out to their immediate right and felt the warmth coming from them. I glanced towards my right and back, taking in another couple of feet, and saw that they were still looking at me. What I didn't immediately think of at first was whether I should ask or whether they could really be watching me, but I was completely unprepared for what happened next. As I glanced at them, I noticed that they had stripped completely and were naked... naked. I looked again and again at their bodies. I had never seen another woman completely... I just could not say that I wasn't attracted to them. I found it strange that they were naked as well.</p> <p>I felt the woman behind me slowly undoing my blouse, taking her time as I felt my shirt being unfastened. I felt the hand move up my skirt, and felt someone's fingers exploring my very wet pussy. It felt as if they were rubbing my entire sex through my clothes. Before I knew what came, I felt the fingers on my lips, and felt myself sucking the fingers hard. My breathing was harsh, something from my state of shock, but I was also very aroused. I felt someone's mouth move on one of my nipples and knew that it was my bestâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
