'She was in the hospital for a couple of day; I don't want that to ever happen to you again.'"</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"The nurse told me to call him Jason."</p> <p>"And what did you think of that?"</p> <p>"You know what I thought."</p> <p>"Did he ever tell you that it was true?"</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"That's because you never asked me."</p> <p>'That's not true, Jason."</p> <p>"It's true," Jason replied.</p> <p>"Good! Because I have someone special to love, baby."</p> <p>"What happened to your Dad?"</p> <p>"His heart beat a little bit when I said something to him and he came out and came over to us and we gave you to me for a son."</p> <p>"What did you do?"</p> <p>"I didn't say anything. He called me Daddy and I said, 'yes'."</p> <p>"He's been calling all week."</p> <p>"What is 'Daddy?'"</p> <p>"He called me 'Dante' but I wasn't Daddy. I called your Dad. My heart beat real fast, baby. Is he there?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"He's in the other room."</p> <p>"I didn't say that; no, he isn't here."</p> <p>Jason went to the kitchen and asked, "What have you been doing at home?"</p> <p>"I'm working at Jason's."</p> <p>That's not good, baby!"</p> <p>"No, you're not!"</p> <p>"I'm not your baby, Dante!"</p> <p>He said, "No, Dante. You're just another piece of ass who likes to get your ass beat."</p> <p>He kissed his wife and hugged her and then went to his Mom.</p> <p>"How'd he feel about marrying you?"</p> <p>"I think he's happy for you!"</p> <p>"Are you sure of the answer, Dante?"</p> <p>Dante kissed Jason and said, "Of course I am."</p> <p>Jason said to him, "Dante, Jason, do I have a choice in the matter?"</p> <p>"No! Jason you're my man!"</p> <p>"Thank you, sweetheart. Do you have any idea what you just did to me?"</p> <p>"Darling, I want to say yes to both, but I don't want you to marry me."</p> <p>"I haven't decided, but I'll go on that."</p> <p>"I'll take you on; I like you far better than you know!"</p> <p>"No but your Dad has a better opinion on that than you do! Do you have time for lunch?"</p> <p>"Not so fast; I've got to finish putting that thing in my closet before it gets too hard!"</p> <p>"Let it go but you can take me up the chimney as soon as you finish up."</p> <p>"Can I ask something?"</p> <p>"Sure; I want both of you to be happy and I'm sure Jason will be too."</p> <p>"Then I'll be as happy as you; but if you don't pick me up by 10:30 I want to have a shower first and then I want to go down to the shops."</p> <p>"Can we have a barbecue?"</p> <p>"I'm not sure what to do."</p> <p>"It's really close to dinner time so if we don't want to wait, I'll go ahead and go to the park in case we're lucky enough to make it." He held the door for them. "Thanks, dear!"</p> <p>"You're too kind to send me shopping," he said as he kissed her hand.</p> <p>When she walked him to the door, she felt a thrill down below for how sexy Jason's ass looked in those tight jeans but the fact that his legs weren't wrapped up that well made her look even sexier by comparison. The reason they were shopping was because of the fact that there was little else they could do.</p> <p>They kissed under the street light and he said, "My Dad will be furious if he ever finds out we're getting married."</p> <p>"Maybe he won't."</p> <p>"No, I think he might."</p> <p>"Don't expect him to want to do anything!"</p> <p>"I hope heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
