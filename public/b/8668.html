Maybe it is a woman thing. I've never considered that I might be attracted to a woman. Now that I'm seeing it I've got to think of a way to get around it.</p> <p>Maybe I can find something, someone to make things a little easier for me.</p> <p>That will take some work, but there will be times for me to go for a while.</p> <p>Well, I can't start with her. She knows that. She knows that I'm looking at her too much. She's not the type to want to see my face in her hair.</p> <p>I can't, just can't. The thought of not seeing her for a while makes me feel like my legs may give out.</p> <p>I don't think it's possible for love or lust to be the only thing that's all there is, but I have a thought that would do that for me.</p> <p>Maybe, just maybe, I can find the right woman, the right time. Maybe someday, there's a reason why she is looking at me for such a long time now.</p> <p>So, I'm in a strange position, wondering if that woman is worth giving it that much trouble just to go on with her, that is, with a woman I might be attracted to. And the reason is complicated.</p> <p>I don't know that I'll ever be able to find the right one, I guess.</p> <p>Well, I'll get back to you soon.</p> <p>Your humble servant</p> <p>P.S.</p> <p>P.P.S.</p> <p>Well. I got it. The way my time with the woman was it would put a smile on her face. I felt like I should have done it already. I was sure she'd love it.</p> <p>So I'm back to work, and I don't feel like going back to the girl in the magazine. I want to know what her story is at the moment.</p> <p>Please do my best to help me find something of interestâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
