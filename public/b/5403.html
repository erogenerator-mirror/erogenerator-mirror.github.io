He leaned back over her as they again kissed, their mouths tasting together in a passionate kiss of their own. After a few moments, he stood straight and pulled off his shirt, revealing his naked chest and stomach. He pushed her back on to the bed, then crawled himself on top of her, his cock sliding up and down her slit before finally pulling himself free and pushing it up so it was touching her clit again. He began to slowly fuck her pussy with his cock. He knew the pace would speed up slightly as she started to pant.</p> <p>"Oh god, yes!" she said.</p> <p>"Are you still angry that I have to fuck you?" he said. "I didn't touch you did I?"</p> <p>"No honey. That's alright. I need to feel you cum inside me."</p> <p>"Well then let me try to get some of that first," he said, leaning in and licking her ear before pulling himself out and laying between her legs.</p> <p>After a few strokes, he was ready again and slid in easily. She wrapped her legs around his hip and lifted him up before he fell back onto the bed, their lips never breaking contact. They held each other as they continued to kiss with their legs clashing around in an erotic dance. She was moaning with the intensity of his kisses. He could hear the sounds of their hearts pounding in time together. He rolled them over, holding her body up, his eyes focused on her breasts as he kissed her. Their breathing became heavier and he could taste the salt of her neck and her breasts, now aching for more attention. She looked up into his, their lips moving to and fro in an erotic dance of her own. He began to roll his hips so he slid himself in and out of her. As he had before, the pace quickened and she wrapped her arms around his neck and arched her back, pulling his face hard against her.</p> <p>"Fuck me!" she shouted. "Stick that thing inside me! Fuck me hard and make me cum again!" he grabbed his dick and stroked, driving faster, pushing her toward her release. She was almost there once again. He could tell it was getting close as she bucked against his body beneath him. He pulled free, only to replace himself between her legs. She screamed his name as he rammed himself in to the hilt. She was cumming once again. Her juices were now a stream and dripping out of her and down on to his stomach and cock as he rammed her with deep strokes, hitting the sweet spot with every push. Her body shook as she shook with it. For a few moments, neither one cared who was experiencing anything at all. He couldn't make words out as a flood of release spread through her body, she squeezed his dick to keep him close. His body began to twitch with his own orgasm, as he continued to cum inside her.</p> <p>After a few moments, she finally relaxed and lay back against him, with her legs still wrapped around him. Their kisses became less frantic due to a mixture of her love juice and cum. They lay together and slowly drifted off for a while. After a few seconds, he pulled himself from her and crawled off the bed. He was amazed at how tight and wet she seemed against him. She opened her eyes slightly. He smiled and kissed her. They lay there for a while. His hand ran across her breasts, down her body, over her stomach and around to her clit. She rolled onto her side, keeping his hand over her now hypersensitive flesh.</p> <p>"Oh my god," she said a couple minutes later. "That was good."
