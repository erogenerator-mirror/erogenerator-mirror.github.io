"Have you ever been with a girl?"</p> <p>I shook my head. "No".</p> <p>A little disappointed, I couldn't help but laugh. "I could ask you the same thing."</p> <p>"What about you?" It was a stupid question and I wanted to know.</p> <p>"Yeah, what about me?" I was in deep shit with that question. I had no idea what kind of girl was into girl stuff.</p> <p>It took me several seconds to find the right words so I decided to play off. "Okay. So. What do you think?"</p> <p>"Well. We have to take some convincing. But for heaven's sake, I'm game."</p> <p>Mandy nodded her head, then continued to undress.</p> <p>After I shed her clothes, she threw her t-shirt on the bed and I got on the bed with her. The position she gave me in those first few seconds was awkward - it was kind of awkward looking at my roommate, but that's how I felt. I really liked her, but she was different. So I played it off.</p> <p>Then I kissed her on the forehead and told her I had to leave. "Don't go."</p> <p>Mandy turned her head and kissed me on top of my lips so I kissed her again. I had to say goodbye. "Don't go. You know I can't do that. I'm trying to make it good for you by myself."</p> <p>Still playing dumb, Mandy looked at me. "Don't worry. I know what you mean."</p> <p>She kissed my nose. "You're really sweet."</p> <p>"Thanks." She didn't have the heart to kiss me again.</p> <p>She was about to go back to her room when I stopped her. "Mandy. I'm not trying to be friendly. We should have a real fun time when we get back together."</p> <p>Mandy stopped me just for a second, then smiled, a very nervous smile. "Maybe you aren't that sweet. Let me take care of your man-pussy once I get off. You'll know how to do it, you'll see."</p> <p>"That's nice of you to say. Just for tonight, I think I'd rather do that."</p> <p>She laughed. "No. I want more of you."</p> <p>I wasn't looking forward to what she was saying now. I wasn't sure what to do. I wondered exactly how that would go, how this would possibly develop.</p> <p>"It's not just a guy thing either. You do it from the moment you meet him."</p> <p>She looked startled. "What? What do you mean?"</p> <p>"I mean about making love."</p> <p>She looked at me with something like shock. "I guess...you should kiss me."</p> <p>"Can't do that." I was kind of flattered but more embarrassed than Mandy had ever been in my life.</p> <p>"I want to. Just remember that no one will ever know."</p> <p>The only reason I'd said all that to Mandy was because we'd kissed earlier, but then she surprised me again. "Are you serious?" She nodded but then I could tell the grin had crossed her face just once.</p> <p>"I was just kidding. It's just kissing if you don't want to try. I don't want to do that."</p> <p>I don't know if the shock of it really came from saying "no", but that night or even the next morning might have given me pause. For the first time ever, I got even more aroused in my life than I had the previous evening, which could only add to my excitement.</p> <p>"I wouldn't say no to anything. It's just a little flirty kissing, not that type of attention from your roommate."</p> <p>I guess she was right on that point. In fact, she had been flirting all evening to try to get more from the kiss, which was a small part of why I hadn't kissed her all evening. Now I wanted to kiss her, and there was nothing I could do to change that.</p> <p>So Mandy made sure to get back to my dorm before school the next day - I mean, all those things could have happened.</p> <p>When I got back to the dorm, the next day I couldn't get the thoughts out of my head. I mean, I'd never had a girl really let go of me and make out with me. And now Mandy was kissing me and that was a big part of the reason for all those little kisses, plus she really had great taste. But then I started thinking it all again.</p> <p>I didn't know what to do.
