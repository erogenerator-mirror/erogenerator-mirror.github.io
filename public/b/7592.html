"If you can make it the way you are," I assured her with a smile.</p> <p>"That's a sweet idea," she smiled back. "Thanks," she said, turning around. "Oh, and you still have to clean yourself off the best you can," she added, grinning.</p> <p>I grinned back. "I'm in a state," I said.</p> <p>"Good," she said, grinning broadly. She hopped out of the water, pulling on a towel before she headed over to the edge.</p> <p>"Do you want me to carry the towel so you can do your hair before I go out?" she called back as she headed to the house. "I'm ready," she called out a little louder.</p> <p>The next thing I knew, my head was in the cool, damp house, and while one hand was busy with the hair on my head, the other was in front of my body under the waterfall in front of me. A moment later, I felt a pair of hands begin to rub lotion over my body as I stood there in the cool, wet air of the house. It felt great...and my heart was racing. After a few minutes, I heard my cousin, Denise, come through the door. She gave me a hug and a kiss.</p> <p>"That's the hottest thing of my life!" she said enthusiastically. "I can't believe I'm doing it! I was going to go back to the house to change clothes, but instead, I just stood there..."</p> <p>"Yeah, I know," I said. "Thanks."</p> <p>Denise finished her own hair, then got herself another towel to dry off.</p> <p>I put the towel down and headed up to my bedroom, where I pulled the covers back on my king-size bed. A little while later, I found a spot where I could stand on the bench that Denise and I had been sitting on.</p> <p>"Are you going to come in here?" she said.</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess," I said.</p> <p>She closed the door and came to the bench, sitting down next to me.</p> <p>"So," she began. "So, it's going to be very awkward, actually."</p> <p>"How so," I asked.</p> <p>"I already told you, that I don't think you'd want me here anymore," was her response.</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"So I told you, I'm sorry. I had a bad day, and I had no intention of coming by to see you again, and I just wanted to make sure you'd feel better."</p> <p>"Oh," I replied, confused a little by the comment. "So, if things turned out like I think, you might just be here when we get back to my room. Wouldn't that be awkward?"</p> <p>"Not so fast," she said. "We could just sit here and talk a bit. Go right on by and get cleaned up. That should be pretty good," she said with a sly grin. "So, are you still coming? If you're not, we can go back on your own and start over, and you haven't even really made any plans for this weekend."</p> <p>"Uh," I said, still feeling weirdly nervous.</p> <p>"No. You're not," she said. "I'm sure you could do with some time to unwind, and maybe just be with me now."</p> <p>"Well, I guess I can handle that," I said. "I guess the last thing I wanted to do was to start getting into your pants right now."</p> <p>"No, no! I definitely won't push you to talk," my cousin promised. "I mean, I just meant I wasn't going to force you to do it."</p> <p>"You didn't force me, you didn't force me, and right now, I have to keep my hands to myself and not be obvious about it," I reminded myself. "It can be confusing to see someone's thoughts, but you'll find that if we talk about it, they won't lead you anywhere.</p> <p>"I don't want to push you, but I'm gonna have to. I was just so surprised by your decision to stay, I don't think there's a time when you could do that with something as important as I am."</p> <p>I felt a wave of regret wash over me as I thought of how I had just been so unprepared. In fact, the realization that this woman had truly fallen over herself in need of my company was just about the worst thing that could ever happen to me ever, could happen to anyone either. It felt like someone had broken my heartâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
