"This is going to take him pretty easy as we usually do it in the middle of the night," I explained.</p> <p>Kerri turned bright red, looked at me through bleary eyes and said, "You're right,"</p> <p>The men all laughed. "This is going to be the best night of our life then," was all we could say.</p> <p>"You're going to be the perfect gentleman to go along, aren't you?" Said Rodger. "If you'd like, I had a little luck there then you'll have to come on with us," Rodger winked.</p> <p>I saw movement on the far side of the hall at this very moment, and got out of my chair and walked over to see who it was.</p> <p>There was none to be seen. He looked like he had just gone to the bathroom and he had stopped and was looking at Kerri right there before her. As he looked, I got the feeling that he was looking at her tits.</p> <p>"How long have you been there K?" he asked.</p> <p>"About 20 minutes."</p> <p>"You have something on your face?" he asked.</p> <p>"A little." A little? I wondered.</p> <p>"I could find you at any time. I'll bet you haven't been doing anything about it at all." He laughed.</p> <p>"Nope, but not with my wife here." We all laughed again.</p> <p>"Are you ready to go home?" I asked Kerri.</p> <p>"Let's go," she said and got up and started toward the car.</p> <p>"Wait," Rodger said, "let's go." As we approached the rear of the car, I looked at him and asked, "are we going back in, or going back out?"</p> <p>"We're going out," he said, and opened the door for us. Kerri got in and got out and I got the wheel, and she jumped in the car and got the wheel, and the men got in beside her.</p> <p>"Do you mind if I use your restroom too?" Kerri asked as we got on out front and started to go.</p> <p>"I'd like nothing better, I'm thirsty," Rodger said and looked at me. I just nodded at him.</p> <p>"What if we come in your face then?" He asked.</p> <p>"I don't care." Was my response.</p> <p>As we drove out of the complex, Kerri and I looked down at each and smiled. As we got closer to our destination, we started to get real hot. Kerri knew that this was going to take more than a few minutes, so she pulled over and turned off the engine. I got out and headed for the bedroom as Rodger got out of the car. When I stood next to the bed, I looked Kerri straight in the eye and said, "I'm not going to give you a hand in getting undressed," as I started to unbutton her blouse. As I was unbuttoning, Kerri's hands were all over me as I removed her blouse and bra. When she was finished, I laid the blouse on the bed, removed her boots, and left her skirt off.</p> <p>As she bent over to get the blouse off, I got a nice view of her bare ass as my lips were just inches from it. Kerri straightened up and got the blouse back on. I then kissed and nibbled at her neck as she walked towards the bathroom. About a half-minute later, the light went off in the bathroom and Kerri came out to see who the man was.</p> <p>Standing in her half-sheer blue dress, she said, "That was one nice man you have there?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I wish I had that much experience."</p> <p>Kerri then looked at me. As I leaned over the sink, I reached in and took her breasts in my hands. Pulling on her nipples and kissing her, I felt her body respond immediately as she squirmed on the bed. "Would you mind doing something else while we're here," I asked her softly.</p> <p>Kerri looked at me and just nodded, so I pulled a hand towel from the wash pouf and wiped the water droplets from my face, smiling at her when she smiled back at me. I pulled Kerri's top leg over my shoulder so that the head of my cock was between her wet lips. I then pushed myself, almost fully hard, into her pussy, as she groaned loudly as she moved against me. I kissed her deeply as I began to thrust into her.</p> <p>"Oh fuck that feels good. I've wanted you all day," was all that Kerri could manage.
