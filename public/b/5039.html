Do you think she wants to jump into bed with me?" I asked with a small laugh.</p> <p>"Not necessarily." She said. "She's just not interested in any of the sex that we might have."</p> <p>"I don't know, she certainly would." I laughed with her.</p> <p>"But... " She hesitated for just a second. "Are you sure you don't have feelings for her?" I'm sure she saw the disappointment on my face and felt the anger well up inside.</p> <p>"That's it," I said. "I'll think about this all."</p> <p>We went back to my apartment to continue our conversation and she finally broke the ice, "Well, maybe we should talk for a bit"</p> <p>"Not at all," I replied. "I think we should try and figure out how to get even."</p> <p>"That's a good idea," She said, and I felt a sudden rush in my heart. I felt like a big boy again.</p> <p>She asked me to stay the night and I agreed. The next morning I told her I'd take off work early to take her shopping and she agreed. She had some shopping to do before she left that afternoon and she had a very sexy outfit on that I had bought just for her. I gave her the clothes in a box and she left me a note, saying she had to go shopping but that she would be back in a flash.</p> <p>"That's great," She told me. "I like this dress."</p> <p>"It is a lot more comfortable." I agreed. "You look like you're going to be wearing the dress for the rest of the evening."</p> <p>"I know," She said.</p> <p>We went to a nearby Italian restaurant and she ordered some pasta salad and pasta and I had some chicken noodle soup. I was feeling kind of good from the food and it turned her on immensely. After we ate our meal we talked more and I did a little research into the subject of her interest in sex and she started to really get aroused. This excited me and I wanted to make sure it continued to an extent I could handle before the night was over.</p> <p>We stopped and she took out her phone to make sure she had a good sound on. Her voice was sexy and seductive and she turned from me to lean forward on the table and I heard her say, "You don't have to do that, if it pleases you." She took my hand and pulled me close and we took a step toward each other kissing lightly on each in turn. This encouraged me to pull the top of her dress down so he could see her chest and a lot of her nipples poking through.</p> <p>As we kissed and touched each other's bodies I could smell her perfume and it was making me feel horny even to look at her for a second. My cock responded and I thought it was going to go up inside my pants again and I could tell by the way she was looking at me. The next thing she knew she lifted her skirt up to her waist in a slow pirouette and reached between us and pulled my erection out for her to feel. She let her hand slide down across my cock and she began to rub it very gently.</p> <p>I was very excited because this was the first time she had given a guy a hand job and it seemed to be working for her. She brought her hand up to her mouth and licked it, making it wet with saliva. "My man tastes good." She said.</p> <p>"Can you feel him?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"I want to see you."</p> <p>"I want to see you." I replied as I put my arms around her and pulled her forward so she was leaning back against me. Her lips parted and I took one of her nipples into my mouth, sucking gently and she let out a sigh. The smell of her hair and the musky smell of her perfume filled my nostrils. I had been with women before in my own car, and the smells of perfume and sexual energy was really getting to me. I started to kiss my way down her neck and she let out a small moan. I kissed around her breasts and she let out a tiny gasp. I kissed up one breast and then the other, taking each breast in my mouth in turn and sucking on hard. She leaned back against me, taking my head in her hands and I could feel her breath coming in gasps. I moved to suck on her nipples again but she backed away and stopped me.</p> <p>"No, no," She said. "Let me take these off." I pulled the straps of her dress down over her shoulder and down to the very base of her breast.
