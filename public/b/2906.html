Because I'm telling you, it's too much. I'm a good girl.</p> <p>I'm a good girl, too.</p> <p>"What about you?"</p> <p>"I'm a good submissive."</p> <p>"Oh, so that you are a submissive!" "I never realized who you were," I replied.</p> <p>"Then why do you think I sent you on that blindfold?" he asked, obviously concerned about what my answer was.</p> <p>"Because it's what you did with the vibrator today," I replied.</p> <p>"When?"</p> <p>I hesitated, as he asked, and then decided to give him the answer he wanted to hear.</p> <p>"When I got horny, I used to masturbate with the vibrator," I said, adding, "And then fuck it, too."</p> <p>"Why," "Do you masturbate with the vibrator?" "What about it?" "Does it make your ass or clit cum, too?" "What makes you cum?" Oh! That was interesting. Could it be my ass, clit? "What about cumming at the same time?" Now I knew my answer. Could it be my clit, or pussy? I felt my body convuls into a fit of uncontrollable spasms as he asked the question. Could it really hurt enough that I could cum? I didn't know. His answer came as a big surprise.</p> <p>I felt the surge through me, and again, my body convulsed as I exploded, once more.</p> <p>He smiled, as I finished myself off.</p> <p>"Did it make you cum," he prompted, looking at my red face which was still glistening with my juices.</p> <p>"I don't know, Sir," I replied.</p> <p>"It does look very sexy, knowing that you enjoyed it, and you did come," he laughed, pulling me back into his arms.</p> <p>"That's a good girl that you are," I said, squeezing his chest. "I really enjoyed it. I did cum. It was so hot."</p> <p>"You enjoyed a submissive woman spanking you, Sir?"</p> <p>"I didn't mean to do that."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Yes, really. I can't help it," I admitted. "It's very naughty."</p> <p>"Yes, I know, I understand. I just wish I could do things like that."</p> <p>"I don't want you to think about it. I'm just glad that you enjoyed it," I said. "And please, let me pleasure you, too."</p> <p>"Ok, if that's what you wish," he replied, sliding down my body to my breasts and between my legs. His tongue darted in and out, getting more and more intense and exciting at the sound of my soft moans. "Oh, I have wanted that," I said, turning my head and pressing my lips up against his eager mouth. We kissed long and passionately, our tongues exploring each other's mouths.</p> <p>When I began to cum again, I felt his mouth clamp down on my clit. That seemed to heighten my orgasm. After my intense orgasm, I felt him kiss my breasts again, his tongue darting out a few times to make contact with my hard nipples, as his hands squeezed my ass-cheeks in return.</p> <p>This time when I came, he made no effort to pause and continue his ministrations, which was just short of unbearable. It was the most intense orgasm I had ever felt. My body continued to convulse with the intensity of it. I was now lost in the throes of orgasm. I felt totally submissive and feminine, but at the same time completely submissive.</p> <p>He stood up. "Are you enjoying yourself," he asked, running a hand down my face, to my chin, giving it a soft wipe, with a finger to wipe some of my juices.</p> <p>"Yes, Sir," I answered, smiling and enjoying the feel of his touch.</p> <p>"Do you still want to have a threesome with me?" he asked, looking at me with that sexy smile.</p> <p>"Yes! I am too," I answered.</p> <p>"Good. Do you really want to?" He asked, his eyes moving down to my breasts as he spoke. He then grabbed my skirt and pulled me up a step, out of his arms. "Can we do it in your bedroom? Just a second," he said, and opened the door.</p> <p>Before I could answer him, he was back in my room with me, stripping me completely naked in his room.
