"He's a really good teacher."</p> <p>"I bet he has a lot of experience!"</p> <p>"Well, a lot! This guy is an adult, but a real adult!"</p> <p>"Well, at least for now!" said another.</p> <p>"I have a lot of experience with... well, with... girls."</p> <p>"How does it work?"</p> <p>The girls continued to make a bit more of a show, so I got up and got some paper. "What?" asked Tina. "Well, for me, the guy is a really good teacher. My experience is pretty limited, but we're very thorough. He teaches English. You've been in a lot of classes in the last four weeks."</p> <p>"And he's a virgin?"</p> <p>"No, and there are a few others he's had with other guys, but he's not as big as I think he'll be. I'm pretty sure I think he's more experienced, and probably less inexperienced."</p> <p>Now, if you've had a lot of experience with girls before, there's something about the way you're acting just that little bit differently and there's a difference. With that in mind, do you think you're experienced in making a woman experience pleasure?</p> <p>I don't quite know if there's any true answer to that question. Perhaps I just need to get some sleep.</p> <p>I didn't get a chance to answer that question until a couple of guys asked her if there was anything else in the water cooler there, but she ignored that.</p> <p>It was still quiet near the end of the beach so when I walked on that end it was still dark and there was nothing to see there. I made my way slowly down the beach toward Tina.</p> <p>The water was cold, and the breeze was cool. I could feel the little beads of sweat on her shoulders, neck, and arms, and on my cheek.</p> <p>I had a couple of minutes of a leisurely stroll around her in the darkness. I could smell the faint aromas of her hair as it fell off her shoulders and back.</p> <p>"Hey," I said, "how's your morning going? Are you wearing something other than a robe?"</p> <p>"That's not what I wore when I walked down the beach," she said.</p> <p>I put my arm around her waist, and pulled her toward me. "No! Don't you speak to me or make any of that noise." She turned away from me and rested her hands on her knees.</p> <p>Her body was as pale and soft as a porcelain doll. For some reason I could smell the faint of her perfume when she was naked under that light robe. I reached behind her and picked up the hem, just like some teenagers probably did. I tossed it on a lounge cushion, and she turned with a start. I could tell she was trying to pull something out of her robe in her panic.</p> <p>Tina saw me and reached her hand out to try to put something onto the front.</p> <p>As if on cue, her hand went beneath the edge of her robe and found something on her body. In short order she had a whole t-shirt of mine that she covered up with, but not her entire robe. She seemed to freeze when she saw it coming to her.</p> <p>"Holy shit!" she exclaimed.</p> <p>Tina looked around wildly to make sure no one was listening for us, and finally she pulled her hands back up to cover herself with the t-shirt, but she was too far away to put it on without a fight.</p> <p>"I... um... uh..." she said, her eyes going all a-sudden wide with surprise.</p> <p>"You know," I said, "there's no one here at school who can see that we aren't naked out of sight, but you have to leave that damned robe at least a little bit, right?"</p> <p>"Um, no."</p> <p>"I didn't mean that way. This is embarrassing."</p> <p>"It's okay."</p> <p>"No, no, it's not that. I mean I could feel my robe getting a bit wet, but I just left it on and... well no I didn't. And I was kinda uncomfortable."</p> <p>"You're not uncomfortable," I said. "You have quite the body."</p> <p>I continued to get all concerned with how this was affecting her. I felt her body quivering.</p> <p>"That's silly, aren't you supposed to be with someone else first or the next day?"</p> <p>"Well you're my first of the season, anyway. I have a lot of experience with women."</p> <p>"So you'll be my first of the day?"</p> <p>"That's the whole idea," I said.
