When she finally got off me, I put my arms around her and we hugged until our tongues were dancing together. I just couldn't get enough of her.</p> <p>"I have been looking forward to today for so long, but I should probably get going now. I need to get back to my house first. That place is all packed.

When she released me, she got in the car and started it and pulled away.
