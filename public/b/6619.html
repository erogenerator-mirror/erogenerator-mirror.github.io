With the first hand hitting his sack, he heard a moan from his own mouth. With those words she was going to make him come! She reached over his face to the wall to get a clear view between her legs. She could tell that the head of his cock was slick and hot and she could hardly keep her fingers from massaging those lips.</p> <p>And he came!!!! She had the next wave to him! It was so violent, so powerful that he felt his cock shoot his second load of the day straight into her body.</p> <p>He didn't realize that she had made one last stroke. She wasn't having any trouble. Finally, he couldn't take it anymore. He pulled away from her and just laid there. Then, she lay beside him and turned and cuddled.</p> <p>He leaned over and kissed her. This time, when he felt her lips on his, he didn't feel the need to have her do anything. He just held her close and kissed her back, enjoying the feel of how warm she was as she lay back. She was completely relaxed in his arms.</p> <p>A few moments later she got up; she needed to shower and change. They turned off the light and he lay there watching her, still hard, still in her shorts, still ready.</p> <p>"I have to get a drink" she said. She took a pull of her lemonade and stood, then slowly walked towards the shower. When she reached the bathroom she turned and looked at his cock. She liked the thought of him looking at her like he did the next time they had a hot shower and the thought of him seeing her in her new shorts had her pussy wetter than ever before. "Oh yeah!" she said. She stepped into the stall and washed her face and hands, then turned and kissed him. "Did you like that?" he said.</p> <p>"I think so. The last time I did was by accident, but I loved it." She kissed him again and stepped out of her shorts and panties. She sat down on the toilet, still nude, took a quick glance at the time as well as took a breath, then turned and looked him in the eye.</p> <p>"I would love to meet you tomorrow after the game. What if I bring some special gift for you?"</p> <p>"You can get everything but we will seeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
