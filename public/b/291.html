Her body relaxes and her legs slide back. I slowly stroke her inner thighs as she moves further and further back. She turns her head slightly and she's looking up at me, with her blue eyes glittering. She's giving me a naughty smile.</p> <p>I keep slowly stroking. I gently start licking her left nipple, making her breath heavier. I work my way closer to the nub. She's moaning and moving her head back.</p> <p>It's still not long and she's reaching between us and stroking my cock harder and harder. I want to give her a little more of a show, but I've only got one thing on my mind.</p> <p>When I pull my tongue away from the soft pink flesh, I want to suck on her.</p> <p>"Oh God," she moans as I pull my tongue from her nipple, leaving it wet. "Don't stop. Please."</p> <p>I pull my fingers from her. I'm now on top of her, my fingers pressed hard against her stomach, stroking her through the thin fabric of her jeans. She moans again and she lets her arms fall over my shoulders, her hands pushing me closer towards her. I take the front of my jeans and press it against her clit. Her body jumps and she lifts her hips to make it easier.</p> <p>"Please, oh please," she moans as I stroke my fingers through the soft fabric of her jeans. It's been so long; I can feel it growing under me. I can feel my cock hardening as I rub it against her.</p> <p>She's reaching for my arms pulling me closer to her; her lips are on my neck and her breath is hot on my skin. Her tongue comes to my ear and flickers against my skin, down my cheek and across my lips. A whisper of a "thank you," comes from her mouth and she starts biting my earlobe. I reach my hand around to her ass and play lightly along her cheeks. She squeezes me in response. She reaches to the ground, her body still on top of me. She pulls me down for a kiss. I pull my pants up slowly until I could feel her warm, wet tongue against my cock.</p> <p>I lift her left leg, putting it on my shoulder. It's not far enough for my legs. We're still laying down and still connected. I hold her leg, just above my head, while my hand plays with her ass and slides down between our bodies. "Mmm." She moans, taking one of my hand and placing it between our bodies. I massage her ass while she continues to kiss my neck and nibble on my ears. My hand reaches farther to get to her pussy, feeling the soft skin of her labia. She's very wet, her slit already glistening with desire. I push my other hand against her and gently massage her clit. She moans and then she reaches for my cock; I lift my head, breaking our kiss.</p> <p>"Please, can we just touch for now?" A devilish smile creeps across her lips. She's clearly in control of the situation and I find it hard to believe this beautiful creature is the dominant one. "No, we're gonna get really, really dirty now."</p> <p>I pull away from her again and lean back against my side, still naked. "Yeah, can we at least touch?" I ask. She gives me a naughty smile. I can feel her fingers on my cock and she's working to slide the head around her opening to slip it inside. Her breath is quickening and I can tell she's getting more and more turned on. She slides the head inside her and makes a slow huffing noise. I'm almost dripping watching her get the entire length of me in. She puts her hands on my shoulder and presses down lightly, so I don't let her go. Her fingers still work to stroke me. "Oh God," I groan as she holds me with a hold tight, moving my hips upwards slightly. Her eyes are looking at me intently while she continues to tease me with her eyes.</p> <p>I pull away from her. "Please, you're going to make me cum soon," she says. I can see, through my hair, the slight quiver in her voice. I kneel over her, our hips still touching. I look down at her.</p> <p>"Mmm, you're really turned on by that, aren't you?" She reaches for me. I reach my hands over her belly. "No, make me cum soon," she says. I lay flat on top of her, her face inches from my chest.</p> <p>"That's what I wanted to hear." I kiss her neck, her breasts, her stomach. I make my way back down to her naâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
