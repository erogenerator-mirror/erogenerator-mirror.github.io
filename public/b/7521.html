Now they were coming out in little peeks of pure ecstasy. Their bodies were grinding together in an almost synchronized fashion. Their breathing was deepening into sighs. The scent of their lust filled cunts was intoxicating. One hand was on the mound between her legs, masturbating in time with her pelvis rocking with the thrusting of her own hips.</p> <p>I was becoming aroused myself as well. The sight and sound of our sexy bodies moving together in front of me with nothing but our breath taking moans and groans was too much to ignore. If that was not enough, the fact I was standing at this angle was adding the friction to the friction.</p> <p>It wouldn't be long before I was going to explode. With my hand I pushed my cock out and let it fly. "That's it, cum for me." I said, in a deep throaty voice. "Let it fly."</p> <p>She looked back down at the thick, veiny penis that had slid up her cunt at the same moment the other two moved to bring out her own cum on my cock and watch me. "It feels huge inside of me." She spoke excitedly as my cock twitched and pumped at her from the inside.</p> <p>To be with a woman, who had a lot of experience, had only had one orgasm prior to this. She knew it wouldn't be long after the two orgasms with her and I. And it wasn't like it had been with any of the other two men I had known from afar. The orgasms she had had just in the past were almost enough to put me over the edge.</p> <p>Our bodies were moving against each other in a mad, lust filled blur. I could see her breasts thrusting against the air with their hard nipples brushing the cool air against my chest. I could see her pussy moving back and forth on her clit with each breath she let out. I was getting so excited that I had to adjust my pants to cover my lap and my cock was as hard as I've ever been.</p> <p>The two women were oblivious to the fact my hands had now moved up their smooth legs. I couldn't resist the soft flesh of each of their thighs as they squeezed as tightly as they could around my hands. And my cock was as hard as it ever was.</p> <p>Their legs were spread wide, and they each had one hand on the base of my cock with the other stroking back and forth. If I didn't know any better, I would have said that the two of them were masturbating me to the edge right now. Their moans and sighs increased, they were both pumping my shaft as hard as they could.</p> <p>Then I knew it.</p> <p>My whole body was electric with excitement as I felt the waves of orgasm start to come out from my loins and wash over and through me. My body tensed up as I let out a huge moan as the first wave of orgasm came through me. This time I cried out with the force of it. I'm sure our bodies and one another could not have stopped, but the feeling of my seed filling her pussy walls was almost too much.</p> <p>As the orgasm subsided, I was still coming back down to being in love with the beautiful pair, even though it was a long time since I had come.</p> <p>"Fuck, that felt good!" I said as I looked down at the sexy woman with her face on the bed. "Was it good for you too?"</p> <p>Her face appeared to blush, but it was only partly. She smiled. "I haven't heard an answer so sweet as 'yes'," she said with a smile that was probably meant as a joke.</p> <p>"Me neither; I mean, fuck, I'm sorry! I couldn't resist!" I replied as I stood up and walked toward the bathroom.</p> <p>I closed the door to the bathroom, and then turned the light off.</p> <p>I couldn't look at anyone else tonight.</p> <p>The one thing I can really remember was watching the four of them in the throws of an orgasm, all five women. I could have made a mess under the shower, and then cleaned off the sticky cum while standing here naked in the bathroom. I just hoped that the women weren't doing anything to keep the show going. Or else I could be home for the night.</p> <p>I got out of the shower and dried off, and then returned to the bedroom. Both of them were lying on the bed exhausted from the intense pleasure that they had just experienced. Both of them had on their nighties. I saw one was a little too small to be practical if their legs were on them. Another one wasn't as sexy as they both were.</p> <p>I walked over to the bed and climbed onto the sheets. "That was wonderful. You are something else."
