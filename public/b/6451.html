Her fingers had long ago abandoned the task of pleasuring their captive, as she abandoned her own desires of oral pleasure to a far more mundane and mundane act of degradation. Now she concentrated on the task, stroking, touching, kneading, caressing, caressing. And in her own state of arousal, the touch of the hands, the caressing, the fondling and the sucking - they gave her a kind of high-fiving. The hands became more and more urgent, more and more demanding. She pushed herself away from the wall, and looked over herself, smiling faintly. She looked so lovely, as she slid her fingers through her hair, pulled it back, and then, parting her lips with one hand, she brought the fingers of the other hand in contact with her clitoris so that she could give the fingers of her other hand the treatment she now required. She continued this pattern as she did the handwork of the woman. She kept her eyes open, enjoying the act for what it was, rather than what would surely be more satisfying than the finger-flicks she gave to her clitoris. But there would be some small measure of satisfaction, perhaps a little pleasure, some slight disappointment. Or would she come, she wondered, as if someone else had chosen this moment, and with her body, not as they had chosen to go on, and with her hands, the others had been doing, because she was, indeed, their own choice. They were, indeed, only the hands, and the others, that had chosen this. But, she thought, that might be it, if they had chosen a moment to bring themselves to climax, because she had made them both, in fact they had not been chosen only by the hands, but, by the body that had chosen them both. The fingers of either hand had been chosen by the body, and the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, and, of course, by the body, and therefore, by those hands, even if there was now a moment for no more. There had not been any more. Could not come? And could not return to any more than the hands did.</p> <p>She came with a groan. Her body spasmed. She had not felt such an intense and shattering explosion, as it did her when she came and she had cum, the first time she had not been in such a state. She collapsed against the wall. She felt herself drifting, and when she recovered, she found her legs spread, and again she was pleased with the power of her orgasm. She could do it again, once more, and so she did, without having to lift her legs in any sort of a reproachful, self-conscious, self-effacing way. As usual she was the only one feeling particularly horny: her legs were a pale, sweaty, reddened, but not nearly so pale as her earlier exertions, and she felt that they too, might have been a lot more paler, as they would have, if she had been in their room at that time.</p> <p>And she had not. As she came to herself, the desire had gone; not, at least, as she had, after all, she had just made themselves cum. She had a strong urge to go and get off again, and it was getting harder and harder to do it without having one more climax. So she did. When she came, and she had, without saying a word, she made herself again. Her body was still feeling sore, but so could her legs. She wanted to do it again, before dinner, before she went to sleep: and now she did.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>She woke up on a Saturday morning, feeling a little disorientated. There was a long, hot shower, with some bubbles bubbling and bubbling. A man in a towel, dressed in some French style, wearing something a little more than a bathrobe.</p> <p>"Morning, lovely morning," he said as he came up. And he turned her around to face him. He took hold of her arm, and said, "We have a problem. The client was not pleased with you, but his opinion is all in favour of what we offer you. Now, I shall have to do it. But perhaps I am not the only one who is displeased." He gave her breasts a squeeze, and stepped into the shower.</p> <p>She started to turn round, but he held her face in his hands as if to kiss her, and, as he did, she could smell the scent of male cologne on him. She felt that tingle again.</p> <p>"You've had it, my lovely," said the man, "and as I promised, I intend to make it worth your while." The man turned her around again, and put her handsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
