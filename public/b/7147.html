She exclaimed as she took hold of my erection and squeezed it, not even pretending not to notice the size it was. "Oh, God, no..." I said, my own voice trailing off.</p> <p>"No, of course not, I didn't expect you that size."</p> <p>"Gosh, look at myself in the mirror." We both laughed, then I watched as she opened the bathroom door and stepped out into the hallway, not even noticing that the only reason she hadn't come in was because we were so far back down the hall, but in the middle of the evening, she'd been the one to stop at my door.</p> <p>My heart started to pound as I stood there, holding my breath, not sure, but I wasn't about to take chances. When I went to open the door, the hallway was dark and the light on in one of the rooms was switched off completely. She turned out of my hallway and into another.</p> <p>She looked so beautiful to me, standing there next to the door that we had just walked past and just inside of the hallway, just staring off into space. I'm no stranger to being in love with women, not to some of the best-selling novels, but to my wife, for the most part. Her eyes were the color of honey as her mouth made an "O" around her lips and her cheeks were puffed out around my member. We had been talking about men, and the idea of being with a man while she watched me doing it made me feel like my cock got hard just watching us. But the idea of actually participating, or even being there alone, got me a little more than a little aroused, especially if it was the idea of doing it with a man, but then I thought I really didn't want to feel that way now.</p> <p>My hands automatically went to her waist as she stepped close to me and stood there, looking at me so clearly that I could hear her breathing getting faster and the slight tremble that went through her. I saw that she was wearing a thin, loose-satin robe, one that was loosely sagging from her body, giving her just a little extra bounce in her garter belt. It fell open so far that my eyes were level with shear cleavage, her breasts swelling and swaying slightly as I stared, a tinge of pink at the edges where her nipples poked through. I thought it would embarrass her to see how easily I was staring, but she leaned in so that we were a few inches apart, our eyes now level with each other.</p> <p>"I don't know what I expected, but you look good, you two." I said, trying to sound positive but also sounding a little disappointed that we hadn't caught on to her situation even as I got excited.</p> <p>"Yeah, I could take my robe off when we get home." She giggled and pushed the door closed with her foot, the door jamb swinging back in place, as she slid off her robe. I couldn't help but stare, too. "I'm glad that's over." She replied, not looking away as she kicked off her shoes, sitting on her bed. She was on all-fours, facing away from me now, her legs on the floor, one on the opposite side of the dresser by the door, the other hanging over it, her legs opening as she leaned back.</p> <p>"I can't stay like this, you're just... so... so beautiful..." I trailed off as I stared at her, not sure where to look. She looked up at me, her eyes widening with a look I'd never seen before, but that I'd been wanting to see for some time.</p> <p>"I'm really not used to seeing you like this, or even that much. But since this is our first time, I'm trying to make sure you're comfortable with it, and not uncomfortable at all."</p> <p>My mind was now working overtime trying to come up with a convincing argument or convincing a half-assed excuse to keep her from knowing that what we were doing was completely innocent and wrong. "Look, I know it's going to drive you crazy." I finally said, leaning forward and trying to kiss her.</p> <p>"I know, don't worry. We'll have lots more time. You're so... so hot for me, and so sexy." She gave me that knowing grin of hers as she leaned forward, kissing me on the cheek. "I'm just glad I'm on my own again."</p> <p>"Me too." I added, trying to look in her eyes and not at her breasts.</p> <p>She smiled at me, a big smile that made me feel like anything she did was just a friendly flirt, and she made it more erotic than anything I'd ever doneâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
