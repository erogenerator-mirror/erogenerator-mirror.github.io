She had short red hair and was just a little shorter than me, and had shoulder-length brown hair and a pair of blue eyes. Our mother, who had always been kind to me, had grown up as a big sister, and while she had been more interested in sports than other subjects, that didn't make her any less my sister than when we were growing up. I hadn't expected my mom to be a tomboy either, if she was anything like her sisters, but I guess I knew now that it wasn't going to be a problem.</p> <p>My mother was tall, and I guess I would have expected my sister to have a little more boobs then her twin, or perhaps even a little bigger than mine, but she was definitely all woman now. Although she didn't have the ass of her daughter I did have a nice pair, and my mom was very well-endowed, at least for a woman. I wouldn't put it by much, but she was wearing some form of underwear that made it obvious that she was naked. At the same time, as my mother's bottom would poke out just out of her panties, I could have been staring at her breasts, but it was just too late.</p> <p>I suppose we both knew, because my mother would stop and ask if I had any more presents to give to her when she got home. She would always look me in the eyes and say, "Oh, no honey. I'm sure you have lots more presents to give me." She always said that, and with that comment all the guys would turn their heads to her and say, "What's so nice about it?"</p> <p>Now, I guess I should describe my sister a bit, then. My sister was a knockout of a lot, but she could hardly walk in a straight elevator with her pants down. At least that's what I would have called myself to make it seem like I was a bit of a goner, or maybe a little mama, or maybe even a nun. My sister was the tallest of all of us at fifteen, and she wasn't that tall, but my mother was just over six feet tall, the same height my mother was, and she was a very nice looking woman to be sure. Not just nice, like my mother was, but nice nevertheless.</p> <p>My sister had a pair of blue plaid button-down pants, which hung low on her hips, and which showed off the bottom of her butt, while the top was a little low on her bosom. I could see some cleavage, but not all the way to her navel. Her arms were thin and long, and her blue blouse ended in a couple of buttons which would have caused a big tent on any other shirt. The neckline of her blouse was low enough to reveal a lot of cleavage and even a little more, even if it was only the top buttons that were really needed.</p> <p>Of course, my mom always had a dress she'd wear that she'd probably come up with and take off when she got home. Not that there was any reason she couldn't have, of course. She had her mom, who was my girlfriend who I thought was the most beautiful woman I knew, and she'd never gone braless or anything like that.</p> <p>I suppose it was hard to look at my mother without being half crazy. And of course, being the opposite of her own mother in all of that, she was pretty damn gorgeous. I mean she wasn't pretty old, but even younger, for the most part, and she was the epitome of beauty. My sister, on the other hand, was a petite bit less than her mother. She had long wavy brown hair and deep brown eyes which made her look very attractive, and she was probably a bit on the tiny side.</p> <p>I think even my mom was an old person at that age who could do anything, especially when she had a woman who was like that. If there's ever a time when anything bad happens, it never happens at all, but that isn't the case now. This sister, that didn't matter to me any other way than as a friend, was like my mom. That said, my mother was like my friend from the waist down. When I saw her walking in front of me at school, I could practically feel what my sister and mom looked like.</p> <p>My sister was also a nice shape, but even still, she was pretty slim with very little of the fat that my mother was. I think the thinness of my sister, though, helped a little. As I said earlier, my girlfriend didn't have the body of my mom, and I guess my mom was good looking, but what she wasn't was just as beautiful as her mother, but she was also a bit plump and wâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
