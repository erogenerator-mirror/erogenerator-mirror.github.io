I'll have a look around at the local town as soon as I run out."</p> <p>A few minutes later I pulled up outside a small local bar that specialized in drinks and food. I found a table in the corner with one window facing the street but with an adjacent door opening between it and the bar.</p> <p>My friend called me back from a kitchen block before we met, "Is this the place you're looking for?"</p> <p>"Yeah. Is there any place this is not?"</p> <p>"I'm getting out of here, I'll meet you there." She laughed "Be a good friend and get a nice hot meal in. My parents won't bother me at all with any of these things. They're a bit of a fudge-ass place, but they're not much to look at either, I guess."</p> <p>We left the bar and found another table in the corner. A few minutes later, we were all seated and ordered a glass of wine.</p> <p>I told her how much I loved her company and felt like she'd know. I also told her that, although I felt no real commitment, I wanted to get home and start living my life.</p> <p>"No! You shouldn't have gone without me. I hope we can have a good time together while I'm gone too." She took one last sip of the wine before offering her hand for some soft music.</p> <p>We chatted a bit until the waitress came over to clear our table. Several times during the meal, she got up to take the man's order. I told her how happy I was that she'd gone.</p> <p>After the meal, I paid for our meal and we made our way to the limo. After driving the few miles to my house, we stopped in front of her modest dwelling. She offered me a glass of her wine and then lit a couple of candles in the living room. The air smelled crisp as the candles flickered as we walked across the room.</p> <p>As it turned out, her whole demeanor and actions were very provocative and erotic.</p> <p>"Are you sure you're ready to put it in? I've never been like this and I thought, what the heck, I'm not going to do it without you."</p> <p>"Are you sure? I don't want to make you uncomfortable. Are you sure you care what I think?"</p> <p>"It would be a bit different having a lot of money; you could take me on the road and..."</p> <p>"I mean, I can drive with you and not have to worry about money." I said</p> <p>"Okay, I understand. I just want to know what your reaction is really like."</p> <p>"Okay. I'm not sure I can go with you to anything but this. As soon as we get to your place I want to take you back to the way we met or even the way you've been for years. But, we'd have to get back to some normal clothes before it would work. I'll go along just to be sure and that way it won't be just you. Okay?"</p> <p>She smiled and leaned against me.</p> <p>"Will you just take me straight to your bed or will you stay and listen to the music and go with me. I know a few people who would love to try things with me."</p> <p>"Thank you, I just hope that'll work out. I want to live to enjoy myself, if that's alright with you."</p> <p>"I'll take that as a compliment. Just to be sure I'll come to your house anyway, so I can listen and see what happens, I'll call you as soon as I get inside."</p> <p>When we got out to her car, another door opening in the front led to an open basement area. I had to lean over to get a good look. As I pulled into the garage she opened the garage door and we walked in.</p> <p>There weren't two rooms at all, three bedrooms and a one-bedroom. The entire unit was a huge flat screen monitor with wireless network. We walked into a spacious kitchen area and she directed me to the kitchen. "It's all yours," she said as she placed our food at the bar.</p> <p>We sat on a table and ate our dinner. With the meal over, she gave me the key, which she placed in her pocket. I walked into her bedroom where she had an armoire. She went to her dresser and opened it. "How about tonight? I picked this out." With one hand she took out an outfit, "Put this on."</p> <p>I hesitated. "What?"</p> <p>"I'll be in your bedroom.
