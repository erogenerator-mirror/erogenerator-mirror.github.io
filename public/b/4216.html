She was still in black lingerie but had discarded the corsage; she was wearing just a pair of heels and was barefoot, her hair down. A large smile crossed her face and her eyes sparkled. She picked up her bag, walked back to me and handed it to me. Without asking, she turned on her heel and strode back to the table. Her butt wiggled as she left; she looked to be as excited as a child on Christmas morning. I stared at her beautiful breasts; her nipples were hard and prominent, the areolas darker and darker with a flush across their surface.</p> <p>The night air was cool and wet; she smelled of perfume and a perfume neither I nor anyone else would consider to pass as alcohol. The lights were off but I could hear the sounds of the city and hear the sounds of the traffic down below as we walked; I knew that soon our bodies would be pressed tightly together, our hands would be exploring each others' backs and shoulders, my right hand would be exploring her breast and the other would be exploring her ass.</p> <p>“Hurry up and put your clothes on, you can leave the outfit for last.” A low voice said.</p> <p>I stepped up to the table and put my clothes on, they fell to the floor, my shoes and socks, my pants and shoes quickly followed. The room was dark except for a small dim light at one end of the room, the lamp was on the table between us; I looked around the room and noticed a set of double leather cuffs on the table. Next to it, some sort of padded armoire. Looking closer I noticed another set of cuffs; they were leather, long and were about 5" long. The cuffs on my wrists and ankles were connected with long straps; they were very tight because of the tension. Moving closer I noticed it had straps on my ankles and I had the urge to run, to run, to escape. I also noticed the rings at the end of the steel rings; they looked about two inches long and about as thick as my index finger. This set was about ten inches long and about two inches across and just barely touching my ankles. My head was resting on the table; my hands were tied at the wrist and ankle cuffs.</p> <p>“Get on your knees,” she instructed and as I complied, I felt that this was another first for me. My eyes were fixed on the floor, my face was hidden by my back against the table and I had a firm grip on my ankles but with my mouth positioned near the table my ass was elevated slightly upward.</p> <p>Her voice came again through the heavy interludes that followed; “You will be good or else you will not understand.”</p> <p>A wicked grin appeared on her face as she stood behind me. From behind, I could feel the leather cuffs on my wrist and ankle cuffs against the skin of my elbows. From behind, I could feel the leather cuffs from the collar on my neck, my body was taught by a different man every day of my life. My legs were still tied but only a slight upward stretch was visible on the back of my thighs. I could hear the sound of leather striking leather, I could only imagine what was happening to me and what may be next. The silence was like a fog, there was the sound of her heels striking against the table, and all of the blindfold was broken by sounds as she stepped around me. I could not escape; I could not see the front side of her face but I wanted her to see my lips quiver with pleasure.</p> <p>The sounds in the room grew louder, there was a long moan as she began to circle me. The feel of leather touching flesh at any level was exciting, almost scary but I never, ever wanted it to stop. A slight smile crossed her face as she circled me again. This time her body was more forceful, much stronger. The smell of leather and leather and leather and leather seemed to explode around our bodies. She was on her back and her hands and body were covered in leather; my body was completely covered in leather. She began to chant my name, “Rach, rach,” her voice became more forceful as the sound of her chant became a shrill, a shrill bellow, a shrill scream; it was the same sound I had heard on Christmas morning with one of my other friends and in our bedroom that morning. She chanted, “Rach, Rach,” and I did all that I could to keep from falling off the table.</p> <p>The noise and sound of leather caressing flesh had grown in scale, even over time, it was not as intense as I had anticipated. The chant was short and I tried to catch my breath, the leather ca—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
