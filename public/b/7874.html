With that last statement he sat up a little straighter and turned to see that I was still seated. He gave me a mischievous smirk, "Now I guess you should get off your seat and get your clothes off."</p> <p>I looked up at him with wide eyes as I reached up on tip toe and took off my underwear and stood, still in my bra, skirt, stockings and shoes. He tossed that aside and sat back in his recliner. I crossed over to the table and took a seat next to him, placing my hands on his thigh. I leaned toward him and spoke, "I'm guessing you're good at this because of how tight my dress is. I mean I'm not exactly the most comfortable, but I think I'll be OK."</p> <p>I leaned back into his muscular chest and leaned forward, feeling his muscular chest on my face. I took a whiff of his intoxicating scent, not a scent that would have led me to believe that I was going to cum just from smelling his arousal. I could see that he was already getting turned on, and even though this situation didn't seem fair, I was finding myself feeling quite a little wet between my legs. All of a sudden it dawned on me that he was about to take me to bed. All thoughts of what a lucky bitch I was to be this lucky were completely out in the open. It wasn't like he was going to take anything off me! It was the fact that it would be his turn to take control of me. I quickly finished my drink and set it down, sitting up to look at him.</p> <p>"Where are you going?" I asked.</p> <p>"You'll see when we get to the bedroom." He said looking away from me just as I sat up in my heels. I was so nervous with anticipation that I quickly pulled my hair back and straightened out the mess, making sure I kept it out of my makeup. I took his hand and pulled him toward the bedroom, closing the door behind us. As soon as we were in the bedroom I closed the door. I was about to turn around to look at him, but he put his hands on my shoulders as he lifted me, carrying me down the hall and laying me on the bed. The moment I saw him, I felt an overwhelming thrill of happiness that I had never felt before! I saw that his eyes were alive and wild, his hands all over my body. I was in heaven. I have never felt anything quite like it. He began to kiss down my neck, my shoulders. As he kissed and licked around my earlobe I could feel the blood start to flow toward my heart. He bit lightly and nibbled at my earlobe. When I gasped and my neck felt as though I was going to explode, he continued lower. He pushed me into the pillows as he kissed all around my lips, down the middle of my neck toward my breasts. He took each of my nipples between his thumb and forefinger, rolling and tugging them just to the point that they were hard little points of hard pointed skin. I couldn't hold back the moan that I had felt before. When his mouth finally came close to the front of my chest I felt him unbutton my shirt and pull it off as he reached behind and unsnapped my bra. I raised one of my hands to play with his hair. He leaned down and kissed the side of my breast. He took his time exploring until his mouth was nearly touching my nipple. I was panting for my attention now. I was so ready to cum and I didn't care. He put his mouth right on the nipple, sucking and teasing until I moaned, and then he did the same thing to it. It felt so good that I could feel it starting to throb in his mouth. I felt as though I was going to explode. I needed to cum so badly, but I also wanted to keep him waiting so I wouldn't have to wait much longer.</p> <p>I needed to cum so bad I was so glad that he had just been doing so well. I pushed him gently onto his back so that he was on top of me. I slowly lowered myself, wanting it to feel even better. As we were kissing I reached down to rub his bulge where it strained against his pants, feeling it grow almost painfully. That's when I felt him lift his hips. He pushed against my hand as I felt him press the button next to the door.</p> <p>I looked around the room and could hear the bed springs creak softly as he sat back and looked down at me. "You want to put your cock in the woman's mouth?" I could only nod as he pulled me toward the bed. As he pulled me toward the bed he lay me down next to him. He sat down onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
