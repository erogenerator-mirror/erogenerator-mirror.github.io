I joked. "Sure can we just be naked?"</p> <p>She smiled and pulled her pajama bottoms down revealing her beautiful bare pussy. I couldn't help but stare at it. In the bright light of the night, the contrast between the red and red of her pussy lips made her pussy look even more attractive. I reached out and touched her skin, feeling the texture of her skin under my fingers. With no hesitation she grabbed me by the hand and dragged me into the house. We were kissing again as we moved upstairs, as we moved to the bedroom next door we undressed each other completely. Her lips left mine as we went and she pushed me back against the wall.</p> <p>I lifted her up so that she could take my cock in her hand and she eagerly sucked it as she lay on the bed. The way her body moved made my whole body react, it was as if I was her. I held her tight to me with one hand as I continued to tease her cunt with my fingers with the other. She started to moan as she came up with me and I looked down at her beautiful body for the first time. I wanted to taste her pussy, she knew it and in fact her legs had parted completely to give me entrance to her hot pussy. I gently inserted a finger into her sopping wet pussy as we continued to kiss. She was so hot that I could hardly wait. I moved in and out of her a couple of times, finding her clit with my finger and she started to moan. I couldn't wait any longer, I wanted my cock to be inside her. I rolled her onto her stomach and moved up behind her. I slid my cock right into her waiting pussy and started to fuck her hard. She was in ecstasy as I fucked her, holding her legs back so that I could enter as deeply as possible. She was dripping wet so I started to cum inside her. My cock pulsated inside her as I pushed my cock harder and harder into her. As I was shooting my hot load inside her, I felt my balls tighten inside hers so I started to cum, shooting my sperm deep in her cunt. As I finished cumming inside her, I pulled her to her knees in front of me and licked my cum from her pussy.</p> <p>We both lay down naked on the bed and slept for a while until the sun came up. This was the first time that I had been in the bedroom with my wife and I couldn't wait to see how she would come out from the dark of the night. A little later, the moon had arrived and our sex was fantastic, even for me it was like an old time. We both woke later still naked to each other being with the other, kissing each other passionately. Then we went back to sleep.</p> <p>When we woke up tomorrow, she had gone to have breakfast with her kids and had come back early. We talked about doing the next day before work today. There is very little you don't do around work and I told her as I enjoyed the feel of her body in my armsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
