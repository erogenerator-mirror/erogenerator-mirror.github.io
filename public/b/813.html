If I had just taken a couple more more pictures of the pair of them, I would have been as surprised as the pictures they'd sent. However, I was still turned on by them. When I'd seen them naked, it was my turn to be stunned. For whatever reason, I was really attracted to them. I hadn't even thought about it in real life, but at the moment, it seemed like my attraction was real. Then, as if they sensed what was happening, they got up and headed to a chair opposite me.</p> <p>I was trying to work things out as they stood up and turned towards me after a brief exchange. "Do you like, um..." I stammered out when she smiled. "I mean, it looked pretty hot and I really liked seeing it."</p> <p>"We'll do this again," she said, and she was still grinning. "This time, you can watch me, and you'll want to stroke it."</p> <p>"But I need to go," I said, shaking.</p> <p>"Okay," she sighed, then turned to leave.</p> <p>"Wait," I said, standing up and walking over to her table to see if I could see anything.</p> <p>"What the fuck?" I heard her shout, then I heard her shout back. "Why the fuck are you still standing there?"</p> <p>I turned and walked over to her chair where I had left my clothes, but my clothes were nowhere to be seen.</p> <p>"Here you go. I took a few more pictures of you as we talked," she said after she turned to leave the room once more.</p> <p>"So," I continued, ignoring the situation, "what are you going to do about it for the rest of the evening?"</p> <p>"I won't be offended, I think I will just sit and watch."</p> <p>"Well, if you ever tell me what you're thinking about, I won't object. And I'm not sure I want to get our sex life back any other way. That's just the point."</p> <p>"I love you," she said, then she gave me the once over just as suddenly as she'd gotten my clothes off. I'd never felt more exposed. It was as if we could both see each other's sex organs through that thin cotton mesh, and my hard-on got the better of me. I could only try to keep my pants on long enough to stop from getting caught fucking her. There was nothing else I could do. She kissed me goodbye, then left. I felt like I'd been out on the road for hours.</p> <p>Well, here we are. I'm not sure if I can make it to the gym tomorrow after I get a job as a dancer, or whether I should be going through with the whole thing, but I'm just waiting for her to get dressed, and I'm not sure what I'll have to do. Well, you know what I mean.</p> <p></p> <p>Later that evening, I was lying on my front with my head on the pillow. I didn't want my head to go any deeper, but I was trying to get my eyes and ears back to where they were when I felt a slight breeze on my naked body. I lifted my head up to see who it was and what it was doing with the light. It was Laura. It was her.</p> <p>"Hi, sweetie," I heard her say. "Did you take a picture of us?"</p> <p>"Yeah," I managed after what I had felt like I was a complete fool. "How about you?"</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she said, "I needed to get something taken and looked like it went really pretty good. I don't know where it went, but I'm pretty sure it does."</p> <p>"No, it didn't look good at all," I said, lying. "I guess I was hoping I could make that up to you."</p> <p>"We'll work on it," she said. "I was hoping you'd want to take a couple more pictures."</p> <p>"Yeah, sure."</p> <p>"If you're willing, go ahead," she said.</p> <p>"I don't think I should take anymore than I already have," I said, as I tried to gather my thoughts in my head. What had happened was still a little light-hearted, but I was still unsure of how far to try to take the next step. I wasn't sure if I was willing to let an opportunity like this happen again.</p> <p>She went to the mirror and came back, still dressed as she'd been a few minutes earlier. "You don't have to come right back," she said when she saw my eyes were closing. "I can see you're really turned on, and I wouldn't think that was too much for me if youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
