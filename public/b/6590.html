As we made our way through the house and up to the door, Dad's voice came over the speaker, "Goodnight, boys. Love you."</p> <p>"Love you, too, Dad," I replied.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Mom and I had dinner at home, just about everyone in school had gone home, and it was only two weeks later that she was off work, and was going back to her usual routine with her life. Mom had always been fairly active around the house (like a teenager with just one mother/father/kids), so she was able to make friends. One could barely keep a conversation going with her at home. But, of late, she also had discovered that being with Dad gave her and her mother a greater enjoyment when things were going his way—and she loved it even more just as she knew that the more fun she had at home, the more she could enjoy the benefits of her son's attentions.</p> <p>She knew that we'd be spending most of the night together for the next several days, and she felt I owed her an explanation about how we felt about each other. She was still deeply in love with my younger sister, and it seemed that they needed to be able to do that and do it for me. She wondered if maybe there's something inside of Dad that she doesn't know about—maybe I'm a little possessive or, perhaps, a little possessive in my dealings with my mother. Maybe there's something that's bothering me, maybe even I'm a little possessive. Maybe, I'm just having a hard time with the thought of having a relationship with my mother, who I think is a woman, as a mother, who also thinks I'm a man. Whatever the reason, she liked that idea more than anything else—I enjoyed that thought.</p> <p>Dad was still in the guest room, sleeping a bit. Mom and I, alone, watched the kids play for a bit, sipping a beer and trying to keep busy with the chores. Then we put on our best 'baby' voices, and came up to him.</p> <p>"Morning, beautiful, is Mom home?" I asked her, as she came up behind me.</p> <p>"And you, Brad," she said, putting her arms around me. My arms went around her and, even though she was naked underneath the covers, I could feel her nipples pressing into my back. One of her hands found my cock and began stroking it, and after a few strokes, I said, "I'm getting ready to go to bed, Mom."</p> <p>She pulled her arm up from behind and took me by the hand, leading me down her hall to our bedroom.</p> <p>"Come right up," she said as she shut the door and led me into her bedroom.</p> <p>"You do that so well," I said. I pulled her close to me, pulling her in against me and putting my hand on her naked body. She leaned back into me and put her hands under my shirt. "Do you have to pee? I really need to get that thing fixed." As she was speaking she had begun unbuttoning my shirt. I stood in front of her and she reached around me to unhook my shirt with one hand while she reached down and took my cock in her hands and began stroking while I took her top off. She reached a little lower to take it off and I put my hands on her bare back and rubbed them from her shoulders down to her butt and back. As I rubbed her ass, I could feel her pressing into me and I pushed her back some. For the first time in this sexual relationship, I leaned down to kiss her on the neck. She pulled back and told me that I couldn't do that just yet, but I wasn't concerned.</p> <p>She walked slowly backwards until I pushed her onto the bed. I pulled her panties off and moved onto the side. She lifted her hips as I kissed and caressed her legs before pulling them up to get the wetness between her legs. As I kissed her legs, I moved my hand up, up, and pushed the lips aside and started to run my hand over her sopping wet pussy.</p> <p>"Oh, Brad," she said. "You're making me so horny. Let's switch positions."</p> <p>She didn't have to say it twice this time, she turned around on the bed and sat on her ass. I moved in and kissed her again before taking the tip of my cock into her and pushing in. It slid in all the way on the first push and she leaned back into me, bringing her knees up—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
