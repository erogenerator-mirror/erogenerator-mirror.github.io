The smell of alcohol and weed was intoxicating, though I didn’t really smell that bad. After a while, the smell of marijuana was mixed with the scent of piss and cigarette smoke and I was starting to feel like I should be making some kind of a drug.</p> <p>At some point I’m just starting to get into it though. I started to feel warm all over and after a long while, as I was taking long gulps of the coffee I must have made of it, I remembered that I had drank all the coffee, so it was just getting some down. My dick was getting hard again, and I knew I shouldn’t be this excited, so I just kept doing what I was doing just to be quiet.</p> <p>This must have made things awkward, because I didn’t know if I should go through with it, but when I finally did, I was very drunk, and I was feeling a bit woozy, so I just kept going, and after about half an hour or so, he started giving me shit about me drinking a lot and asking me for money sometimes. He was obviously feeling pretty pissed off, so he tried to make me go out and have a bit of a party without even looking like a wuss. It turned out to be a real bitch; he had me in so much trouble after all.</p> <p>So now I was feeling kinda drunk, which made me want to make some more of my own money, and besides, my parents would be out for some business and I don’t want to give them the wrong idea. I just kept going on for a little while and the more drunk I got, the more I kept feeling like I was losing power. I wasn’t feeling really pissed off though, and I wasn’t feeling particularly bad either.</p> <p>Just before the end of the night I finally got a little under control again, and I still hadn’t got over how many people I had thrown into the room. The group on the far side of the room was about fifty- forty of them, about a hundred of them still dressed as they were. But before I even started to feel good about myself, I heard some of the guys talking to all of the woman. They were whispering to each other and I couldn’t make out any details of what they were saying. They wanted me to say something to them about where I had been. Some of the woman had her hands in her pockets and were looking at me funny.</p> <p>Finally, about half the room was silent. The next half an hour or so was getting crowded anyway, so there wasn’t that much to be said. Finally, the guy from the room from the group that I had been with started yelling that I should fuck her or something. That was all I could stand to hear. I started to back away from the group of guys and I started to throw up, and then I heard someone say “I love you,” before it was completely over.</p> <p>While I was running out of money (and some of it was spilling out over the rim of the pot I had already drunk), a man that I wasn’t really seeing came up for air. One thing that I know about him is that he liked to play with me for about an hour before he got tired of me. With that in mind, I decided to head back to my apartment (no pun intended) and have some fun with him.</p> <p>At that point, the bar was closing and I walked around the corner of my apartment, and started to look for a way to get back inside. When I saw the barman, I said that I needed a cigarette and he gave me one, and I started to walk toward it. When I came back I still had a long line and even with the cigarette burning for a little while, I still had a long line in front of me. I finally got to my house after having it for a couple of minutes and decided there was still not much to do right at all. I made my way to the bottom of the stairs and I didn’t see anyone on the landing.</p> <p>I figured anyone else had already probably moved over and were probably waiting on me to say something. The guy from the group at the bar told me that after the bar man talked to all the women, some of them did have a boyfriend or boyfriend-girl relationship that it was just kind of an oddity. But I didn’t think it was that strange at all. I was looking out the window a bit and I saw a group of guys walking past. When I came back out, I found that I was in a fairly good group, and the group that I had been with when I had drunk all the time was still there.
