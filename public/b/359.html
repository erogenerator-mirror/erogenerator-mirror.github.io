But we'd better take these home." and, she put her arms round me, drew me into another deep kiss.</p> <p>She pushed me gently towards the bedroom door and we both jumped up together, hugging and kissing passionately. She had removed her blouse, her bra, and unhooked her bra when we heard a sound from behind the door. She was naked except for the panties she had thrown on. She jumped on the bed and, with the duvet down and my hands reaching for her, she pushed her body into mine in a most welcome way.</p> <p>The kissing escalated in passion and as she sucked my tongue into her mouth, her hands pulled my knickers down my legs and she ran her fingers over the damp hair between my thighs before pulling them out and taking my hand and helping me pull the skirt on up the back of my legs. My knickers were only a triangle of lace that covered me, so I had to keep my legs parted as I kicked my shoes off, pulling the skirt up over my hips.</p> <p>"Do you want to feel my panties?" she asked.</p> <p>I nodded and she slipped her knickers completely off, throwing them on my bed. She dropped her knickers to the floor with them, sat on the bed and started to caress her clit with one hand. She parted her legs and slowly ran a finger across her pussy lips, pushing it in up to the second joint and out again before running it round her entrance. My own clit would have throbbed, but I didn't move. She slid another finger inside me as well. She started to thrust her fingers in and out of my vagina, the feeling so wonderful. She pulled her fingers out and used her mouth to suck my clitoris, which became more prominent.</p> <p>She pulled her fingers out of me, held up her hand saying, "Oh God!"</p> <p>With her other hand she held my breasts and pinched my nipple. "Is it always like this?"</p> <p>She didn't answer as she knelt on the bed beside me and said, "It's wonderful, but it's just the beginning. Now please take them off". She kissed her way up my stomach. She stopped at my breasts and ran her tongue across my left nipple. She sucked on each breast, her tongue twirling in between them and she pushed her mouth all the way down until her nose hit my pubic hair. It felt so good. Next she kissed her way back up to my breasts, where she sucked my nipples and her lips closed over them, sucking them.</p> <p>I couldn't control myself. I felt my orgasm building up in me and she pulled herself almost out of range of my orgasm. She wanted to feel it. The tip of her tongue ran over and around the end of my nipple, her teeth grazed against it and then I felt a sudden wave wash over me, that felt amazing. It was as if my whole body knew what was happening. I could feel her tongue flicking and circling my nipple while rubbing it the same way. I started to come again.</p> <p>When I had caught my breath and her mouth was holding my breasts I pulled gently away from her. There wasn't much of me left, the last couple of strokes were just very slow and sensual, kissing my stomach and her face. She was lying on the bed beside me and her hand gently ran the back of my hand across her nipple, which she was holding out of the valley of her breasts.</p> <p>Her hand then ran round me, pushing and tugging and pulling me, pulling my hips up, pulling my clit into her hand. She pushed herself down on the bed again. I pulled her down over on top of me and we kissed for quite a while. She lay with her bum resting on my thighs while she ran her fingers up and down my stomach, across my hip and back to tickle my clitoris. I pulled at her bottom lip to put some pressure on it, encouraging her to do so further. It felt so good.</p> <p>Without breaking the kiss she said, "Your turn now."</p> <p>I did not get to work with what happened before. I rolled onto her other side and, taking one of her breasts with me, I played my tongue on her nipple. She responded almost immediately. I pushed myself up and got to work. My mouth and tongue did exactly the job as she held me to her. I wanted to come so badly, I wanted so badly to be in her mouth. She was doing exactly the same. Suddenly her breathing grew quicker and she grabbed my hand and pulled me up off of her so that it was not onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
