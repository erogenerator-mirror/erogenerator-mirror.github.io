She did, but then said she wasn't ready to talk about it yet. Then she got up, pulled the chair out from behind the desk of hers and sat down.</p> <p>We hadn't talked much about our plans for the wedding until we both had a bit of a brainstorm about how to get everything done and how we would get to the bride.</p> <p>We agreed to meet me in the cafeteria as soon as we got my picture taken.</p> <p>I went down that night to talk with Michelle. She had a smile on her face when we met.</p> <p>After we had some serious talking, I found that she was really looking forward to go to the wedding. She told me she knew I couldn't say to anyone how she really felt about it and that she wasn't ready for that, but that she figured she could talk to both me and her.</p> <p>Our discussion about the wedding got a lot more heated and she started to have more problems that morning. She also decided to talk with me more, to ask what was the problem. When I came back into the office later, I told her that we both knew it would work out.</p> <p>That night, Michelle and I had plans.</p> <p>We met in the middle of the night while I had sex with her and then it was just sex.</p> <p>To make conversation pointlessly, we were both naked but for our robes. She leaned over and kissed me and then she slowly started to kiss my neck down to my breasts.</p> <p>After several minutes licking them and sucking them, she pulled back and said, "I really don't want to do this, this is sooo wrong. But here we are again so we both have to make love."</p> <p>She then reached down and grabbed my robe and pulled it off.</p> <p>"Do you really really want me to make love to you at this time?"</p> <p>I just said, "Yes."</p> <p>"I don't even know what the problem is, but we need to do it now."</p> <p>She climbed up on me and we both started to kiss again. Our kiss was different than earlier and that was great.</p> <p>I told her of the trouble I had in knowing that if I wanted another round of it, I had to be the one to make her feel good.</p> <p>We started to kiss again and she said, "I don't know if I wanted to do this, but if you have something I can't do, that would be ok. It is the only thing that will keep me from feeling a whole lot better so I'll just have to give it a try to make sure it doesn't make my feeling better."</p> <p>I guess she understood because she then started to grind her crotch against mine.</p> <p>We had started by kissing and it seemed like a second ago that we were kissing again.</p> <p>She said, "You know what I have to do, so what I have to do is to make you feel good and make love to you so you can decide for yourself. How about you make me feel good?"</p> <p>She climbed off of me and took off the rest of my clothes as she had before kissing me.</p> <p>She looked down at her pussy as she began rubbing it.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I did that to you, but if you want, I can make you feel better for it."</p> <p>I told her it was ok. But then I said, "I don't want you to do it to yourself. It should only feel good when you make love to me. I love you more when I feel something that is more pleasurable than having to hold you back."</p> <p>Then she rolled over on her back and got up on her hands and knees and said, "Let me try, since I feel you're too good."</p> <p>She looked over her shoulder at me as she crawled over on her hands and knees and positioned herself for me.</p> <p>"Do you mean what you say?"</p> <p>"Yes. I love the feeling of you in me."</p> <p>"Ok.</p> <p>I lowered myself on my knees and slid my cock into her.</p> <p>She said, "Oh my God, that feels good"</p> <p>I told her about the pain that had gone through my body when I had my cock in her before. She responded by saying, "I know. I'm a little sore."</p> <p>So I told her what had happened and how much I loved her.</p> <p>"Oh that's wonderful. I love itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
