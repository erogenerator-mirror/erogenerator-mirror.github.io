Please tell me you're my real girlfriend and not your boyfriend, this is really awkward!"</p> <p>"I'm Hannah, right?" She said, sounding surprised. She said, "I don't know how to say this before, it just slipped out, I was just kidding with you, well...I mean, are you...I mean, it's just...I haven't, we never..."</p> <p>I sat there for a second, trying to process it all. She'd actually asked me out! I guess she'd known the moment I'd said yes or no for all this time, that she had already made the next move. I'd been pretty much paralyzed at that point, my fear had been replaced with a growing desire for her. If she'd known, then I would've run, run a mile, and had probably done exactly what she'd said she had, given her request and me. Oh, I had no reason to run! I still didn't know what she'd think, but she said yes to everything I'd said. She had to have been a virgin!</p> <p>"Oh please Hannah, I don't want to be your boyfriend." I said. She got this big, mischievous grin on her face, and said, "Please don't! It's true after all this time, we're still virgins. You know if I was a girl...oh god I'm sorry Hannah, I'm just an inexperienced girl, maybe you'd like to be my boyfriend...oh god I do want to....I need to be your boyfriend and still a virgin, I don't know how to be your boyfriend."</p> <p>I was pretty sure she didn't know what to say. I really didn't want to be like that; she was just one of those girls who wouldn't go for sex, just come and get laid. At least I had to say what was happening to me to appease her, I'd done pretty good so far. She had the nerve to ask to be "my boyfriend?" I suppose she might have liked it, but apparently, she wasn't asking, she wasn't asking, she wanted to be my girlfriend. I wondered if she really knew who I had or maybe just hadn't told me yet. I had to see what that look in her eyes was. If she was willing to come out with her sexuality right away, she could have done the same thing I'd just done to me, and then, all of a sudden, she'd wanted to be my girlfriend too!</p> <p>"Yes!" she exclaimed, "and yes I do like to be your boyfriend!" She took me by the hand, and we kissed passionately, my cock got hard as I watched her getting me out of my clothes from under the table, she kissed me again as she sat down, I couldn't get the feeling of her lips sliding over mine that felt so good, I'd never been kissed like that, maybe it had always been her lips over mine, but the touch was so sweet, and if anyone had really been kissing her before then, they'd have loved it. I was still confused how such a thing could be possible, and so, to get her talking, I started to get it.</p> <p>I was her "boyfriend."</p> <p>"Hannah, I'm not your boyfriend!" I said, "You said you wouldn't be my boyfriend" (I didn't have to say that many words, and I was pretty sure I said the phrase pretty loud enough, but didn't want to be overheard), I wanted her to "be my boyfriend" and not someone just as inexperienced; I didn't want her like that, I wanted to hold her in my arms and I knew if I kept it up...</p> <p>"Ok" she said, "just you know...don't you want to be my real boyfriend, you said you'd be my boyfriend!"</p> <p>"Yes, but..."</p> <p>"Please don't forget about me!" I snapped at Hannah, "You might end up being something else!" I was starting to get frustrated, it was like my hormones had kicked into overdrive at that point, I wanted to be her real boyfriend.</p> <p>"You can't do it, you can't do anything, can't you! You don't need to be my boyfriend!" she sounded really hurt, I was beginning to regret saying the words again, it was my fault, she had to be my real girlfriend for a moment.</p> <p>The realization hit me. I wanted to be her boyfriend. I really wanted to be her boyfriend! If I got her to do it then, then, if she wanted, I could do it, just let her continue, I felt pretty sure she didn't want to tell me that. I felt that I already knew her real name so well, she didn't even know my last name. I had to talk her out of it.
