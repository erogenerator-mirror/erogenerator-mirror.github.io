He was the only one that would be on my list of things to do. So this was an important time for me to leave, so I left him to deal with and make the call. I walked out of his office, walked down a deserted street and up one of the dark alleyways.</p> <p>I was not going to be a good boy. But it didn't really matter. I had been thinking about him for a few days, and I wasn't about to do anything to jeopardize the relationship. It was a good thing, as I didn't want to ruin it.</p> <p>I walked through my neighborhood, getting closer and closer to my destination. It was a quiet street, not too busy, not too dark. We were barely a mile away, and I could smell the sweet scent of his sweet perfume.</p> <p>I decided to put the head of his cock on the driver's side of the SUV with enough space for it to make its own sound.</p> <p>I walked around to the side of the SUV, bent over the hood, and put my finger against my clit. It was already slick and moist. I stroked and rubbed gently. I didn't want him to know what he had done to me. He would just have to keep quiet, and I would be gone. He'd never find out how much I let him hurt me.</p> <p>He looked down to see what I did. He had no idea what I was doing. He didn't even know what to make of me. I was his girlfriend to be used to pleasure, and it didn't matter. He couldn't help but wonder if I was really that interested in him. I'd had this whole evening planning out all my plan, and what I was going to do with it.</p> <p>I didn't care whether he liked it or not, how I was going to do it, or how I was going to make him happy. All I cared about at that moment was the pleasure of what I was doing. I was his to be fucked. And maybe one day, I would give him that pleasure.</p> <p>The head of his cock had a special ring around it that locked him in a certain tight place that only I would be able to penetrate. The way I would slide my fingers inside of it gave him that special tightness that I had craved for so long.</p> <p>He watched me intently and was clearly waiting for me to do something. I walked over to him, and reached down to his lap. I wrapped my hand around his cock, and stroked him slowly. His hands moved to my nipples, pinching and pulling on them. If he'd noticed I didn't care, he didn't show it. I looked down at his cock, and looked into his big brown eyes. The light turned my eyes toward the sky, and I could see stars above, looking at me while he jerked in my hand.</p> <p>He was in lust with me. He was getting everything that I asked for. And if I hadn't kept him out of that ass hole of his, and gave him more pleasure in bed with me, he would have made me regret myself. But I didn't.</p> <p>I slowly unzipped his pants and he raised it to let me remove it. I sat back with my legs spread lewdly, and he immediately took them off. I was his little slut and I had to do as I was told. I opened my legs, and pointed the tip of my pussy at the swollen lips of my pussy. He wanted to be inside of me.</p> <p>I opened the hole with my fingers, and he entered the first two inches with his fingers. He stroked the shaft slowly, and then slowly thrust himself fully into me. It felt hot and strange inside of me. I didn't really care if it stretched me, I just needed his throbbing cock to stretch me open.</p> <p>He looked down to see the wet pink lips of my pussy spread wide and my clit engorged and hard. He thrust in my body with all the strength he could muster. I grabbed the bottom of the hood of the SUV with both hands and lifted my body high to meet his strokes. It felt like my head was being pushed back and forth, and I was crying out in ecstasy and joy. I could feel the orgasm start deep inside of me, and I was moaning like I never wanted to end.</p> <p>It hit me like a wave that was so powerful. Even his cock was buried completely inside of me. I was screaming in pleasure, and he was thrusting faster. I wanted him to make me scream.</p> <p>He slowed down, and I felt myself start to calm down. He just held himself inside of me as long as he could. The feeling of his large head slowly leaving my pussy, and just the pressure of his body inside of me, all that pressureâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
