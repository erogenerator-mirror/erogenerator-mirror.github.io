Our kiss made little light caresses just as we had when we were younger. He pulled me down on the bed, and soon felt the moisture in my jeans. I lay back and pulled myself off him and stood up. I stripped off my shirt and bra, and then lay back on the bed. "I'm so fucking hot," I purred between breaths.</p> <p>As I peeled off my panties, my own arousal climbed up on me. The wetness of our kiss was intoxicating. I opened my legs invitingly, waiting for him to move near, but he moved back, not moving beyond the bed. He came in behind me, and I felt his warm breath against my pussy. He had my entire crotch in his hand, and he was looking at my pussy and ass. I held his head toward me, urging him to kiss me. He was, I realized, completely at my pleasure, because he didn’t say anything. He didn’t stop in fact, he didn’t even ask me for what I wanted, he just kissed me some more and continued. My hands touched his face, then slid down to his shoulders. My hands slid down his chest and then down on his hips.</p> <p>I broke the kiss to tell him, "Oh, you’re so beautiful," before turning him and putting him in me. He quickly penetrated me, sliding in until his hips slapped me against the bed. As soon as we were completely joined, he started moving in me and I moaned. "Please, make love to me. I need to be fucked," I whispered.</p> <p>"We'll get to that," he said emphatically.</p> <p>I pulled him on top of me, and his dick slid easily into my slick slit. We had only held one position for so long, that we had a full day of lovemaking before we had to come up with something. I had no idea, but I was all in for what I hoped would be my last one. Even after I was on my back with a large pillow underneath me, he was still moving into me.</p> <p>Then he started pumping and I was ready for what was coming. I felt a familiar pressure building inside me. I had just cum just a few minutes ago, and I knew I was going to cum again soon. I felt his hands pulling my legs up, stretching them just far enough to get his head between my legs. There was still a moment of indecision. If I wanted to tell him not to move, I might as well. Then I felt his lips come on top of my crotch. His tongue flicked the area where my clit was as his lips slid around it.</p> <p>Instinctively, I wrapped my legs around him, pulling him into me. He was moving steadily within me, which only spurred me on more. Before I knew what was happening, I was being driven into the bed, my legs lifted over his shoulders, trying to give him everything I was giving him. I felt him pull out of me a second before he was completely back inside me. I felt his dick slide in and out of my snatch a third time, making me moan, a sound like "Ugghhh." It drove him wild. I could feel our movements becoming faster and harder as our passion grew. I thought I may have blacked out, but I felt as if I floated in a sea of desire and ecstasy.</p> <p>"Harder," I cried urgently. "Fuck me harder!" I urged him on, and when he responded, I felt my body tremble and convulse.</p> <p>As I lay with my eyes closed, I felt his thrusts increase and he slammed in and out of me a few more times. I sensed his approaching orgasm, and I felt my own as well. The sensation was incredible, even the friction of his dick between my pussy and my body. As I reached my crisis, he pulled out of me almost immediately and climbed over me on his knees. I spread my legs wide, inviting him to enter me hard again. When he entered me and I felt his hot, thick dick rubbing against my crotch, feeling it slide against my labia as he was buried deep in me, I nearly came again.</p> <p>The passion, the desire we were feeling, the love I felt for him, was indescribable. We had only begun to make love in the past ten hours, and we had lost ground in the intensity of our coupling. The sheer intensity of our pleasure was overwhelming. He drove his dick into me deeply as he held himself up above me. His body was tight against mine and I felt very aware of his body and everything else except the—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
