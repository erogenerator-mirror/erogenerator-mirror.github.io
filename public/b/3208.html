I was surprised and somewhat relieved that she'd given in again.</p> <p>"It's not very pleasant being the only one of your company to have sex with me and have to take me home and have sex with me in his bed."</p> <p>"My ex did it just to hurt you," she stated. "He fucked a few other men's wives before she finally told me what he was capable of."</p> <p>"I can handle it." I didn't want to believe her.</p> <p>"I don't."</p> <p>"You do?" I asked.</p> <p>"Absolutely." She gave her body back control to me and then gave it back to me. "Can you help me?" I was so grateful to her. She told me what I could do for her, and she had more than enough to buy. I gave her a call right away.</p> <p>"I can't wait until Friday," I said. "We'll hook up tonight."</p> <p>"I'm going with you," she responded. "How will you know exactly to what to wear?"</p> <p>"There will be an elaborate set-up in there and as I'll be fucking you, it'll be our prerogative to let you know what you are getting and what you're not getting."</p> <p>"You're kidding me?"</p> <p>"Not at all. I think you'll be comfortable."</p> <p>"Why are you laughing?" I asked.</p> <p>She was. "It's just something I did." She paused and said, "I am going to fuck you." She looked at me and said, "You're going to get fucked tonight if it gets any better, okay? I'll have to buy you champagne."</p> <p>"That sounds like fun," I responded as I took my clothes off. She was sitting back in my chair, waiting for me to take off my clothes. Before I could get completely naked, I had her on the table and was on my knees in five seconds. She held me in place and kissed me. Once I was fully naked, I kissed her neck and started licking her nipples. "Mmmmm, your lips feel so good on them," she whispered.</p> <p>I licked a trail from her neck to her tits, and then started kissing a trail down her stomach. As I neared her bush, I spread her legs. She moaned and let me continue kissing her legs, while my tongue traveled up her wet slit. I looked up at her face and saw her tongue circling her lips. "Kiss me," she requested, as her body squirmed against me.</p> <p>My mind raced for a second. I knew where I wanted to eat this woman. I wanted to taste her essence. I had to get this woman, but how? She'd kill my life if I didn't do it. I kissed her lips once again, and then took her between her legs. She let her legs fall open so I could get my head in between. Licking and kissing her body, I pushed my head between her legs.</p> <p>She grabbed me and said, "Kiss me." That got me going. I started eating her with the energy of a wild cat. She tasted so good and smelled so good. I licked and kissed every part of her body I could reach. I licked up her clit, which she loved very much. I started kissing and licking around her pussy, which was dripping down my throat. I pushed my tongue inside her and started probing her clit with my tongue.</p> <p>"Harder, oh God harder, don't stop. Oh God, more, don't stop! Oh shit! Make me cum!" She was calling me names now and I knew she was losing control. I was ready to let her have her way with me. I wanted to show her a new kind of pleasure, just as I knew she wanted it. Taking my hand, I replaced my dick in her pussy with my finger. I used the same motion I used on myself whenever I was ready to cum. She wrapped that pussy around my cock and I heard her moan. I could see her clit swell, which was perfect. She was so wet, she really knew how to work her pussy.</p> <p>"Harder! Oh God!" she begged. She was close.</p> <p>So was I. I started to lose control, as I felt my load building up to something very close. I was right there too. I pushed as hard as I could. She pushed back against me and held me on her. I collapsed on her, breathing shallow and fast.</p> <p>"Wow, that was... amazing," she said as she looked at me.</p> <p>"Are you okay?" I asked. Her eyes were moist and her chest heaved. It surprised me.</p> <p>She smiled.
