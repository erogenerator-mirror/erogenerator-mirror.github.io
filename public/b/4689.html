I'm not sure what started it, but I know it made me feel good. As I approach you from between your legs, I feel the tension in your legs relax and you just smile, that's good, I'm enjoying being this close to you. It just felt so good having your eyes caressing my body that I wanted to move closer, but I didn't.</p> <p>Instead, I lean forward and gently kiss you while you hold onto my shoulders for support, kissing me everytime one of my lips meets your. We're both breathing hard now, and I'm breathing hard just being close to you, the feeling of your heart beating in rhythm with mine is making us both want to kiss each other as hard as we can.</p> <p>"I'll be back soon," you say with a kiss, then a smile. With that, you turn away and walk towards the stairs, I follow, and I have no idea when we reached the bottom, but I can only wonder what you're doing up there.</p> <p>When I get out on the second floor, I can't help but look along the railing. I never take my eyes off you as you walk over to the door. You're not stopping me from going inside, but you know that I know what's about to happen.</p> <p>As I go into you, you stand there for a moment giving me an almost inaudible nod, then, you take a step backward, and I know you've found your target.</p> <p>You grab my chin and turn it toward you, but I don't respond. Instead, I can't take what you're about to do any longer. And soon enough, I feel something brush against my upper thigh, and instinctively, I spread my legs for you, inviting you to play with my pussy. You lift my skirt and lift my hand, and I feel the fingers of your other hand gently rub across my pussy as you're still standing there watching me. I can't help but moan out loud at the feeling of your fingers caressing my pussy, pushing up into me.</p> <p>"I want to watch you touch me," you say with a bit of a mischievous smile.</p> <p>"Ohhhhh," I say with a bit of a gasp and a twitch. "Do you want me to touch you."</p> <p>"Yes," you say with a look of lust in your eyes. "Touch me." I have no reason to be shy now, and as much as I want to, I don't want to be. I push my face into your neck, moaning softly as you do it.</p> <p>"Please...touch my pussy...please..."</p> <p>"Yes, I am," you say in a slightly shaky voice. "I want to see you touch."</p> <p>Your fingers go deeper into me now, and I arch against you as you push deep inside of me. I'm enjoying the softness of your skin, and the pleasure of being so close to you that you can feel how wet I have become by what we're doing. You bend forward and take my hair into your hand, pulling it back so that I have a bit of relief from the pressure on my neck.</p> <p>"Open your eyes," you say in a throatily whisper, pulling me in for a kiss right at that moment.</p> <p>You keep one hand on my upper back as you kiss me deep, and it almost feels like we're connected by water, as we touch in a way that transcends all common feelings and experienceâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
