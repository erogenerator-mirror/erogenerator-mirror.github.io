"I love this..."</p> <p>"That's a good girl," Sam groaned.</p> <p>They rolled over until he was on top, now slowly easing back and forth inside her. As he was in the dark, her orgasm grew again and in a quiet tone, she said, "Please, fuck me harder," and he started to pound harder. Harder was the best word to describe.</p> <p>When they heard a soft knock on the door, they both started again, and the door opened. "It's open," Emily said, still breathing heavily. "I just got home early," she admitted. "What you guys doing up?"</p> <p>"Getting a cup of coffee," they answered. Sam said they'd gone to bed early, and Emily said she'd be along. "Let me get you something to drink," Emily said, as she walked over and sat beside him on the small breakfast chair.</p> <p>When they'd finished, they sat in silence, the water warming their lapses of hot chocolate, and the radio playing a slow, sad tune. Sam spoke first. "I wish we'd had time," he said, "to do this. When we found each other."</p> <p>"I know," she said.</p> <p>At last he finished his sentence. They'd agreed they wouldn't tell anybody, but it had slipped out. Maybe we could have gone to a motel. Maybe we could've stayed in that dark room for awhile. This would have been our only explanation to why we couldn't be happy with each other on that first date. But as it was, it didn't matter, because that night was the happiest moment of our lives.</p> <p>"Well, get some rest. We'll talk tomorrow. I'll call at work on Monday and tell them I'll be out of town for a weekend," he said, kissing her head. "Then we can just go back to fucking tonight. You'll never want that again. Okay?"</p> <p>Emily gave him a little nod but she was smiling and smiling, happy at being able to share something like this with him. She meant every word of it. She just didn't know for sure how she felt about it. "Okay, I'm ready to get some sleep," she said. "Are you guys going to talk tomorrow?"</p> <p>Sam laughed and Sam looked at the clock. "The coffee will be there in about twenty minutes. How about you?" he asked. "We'll go over there to get us more coffee."</p> <p>"That sounds good," Sam agreed. "Give me a chance to get you something then."</p> <p>They heard the sound of a door opening and closing and Sam turned to look at Emily. "What are you, naked?" he asked. "I thought I told you to get something off."</p> <p>Her eyes were shining, and she had a dazed look on her face. "You told me to get dressed," she said, but she didn't look angry. "And you made love to me."</p> <p>"No, I didn't make love to you; I just took your virginity," Sam explained. He'd put on a tee-shirt and jeans, and he was still fully aware of what Emily was saying, so he knew she couldn't be telling him to go fuck himself.</p> <p>She smiled at him, and he blushed.</p> <p>"Please," she said.</p> <p>He smiled back. He'd found something to like about her and hoped she wasn't repulsed.</p> <p>"I am sorry we couldn't make love any more," was her response, and she reached down and cupped his cheek. He looked surprised, but nodded his head.</p> <p>"There's nothing to apologize for," she said again. "You were great."</p> <p>"It isn't every day that a beautiful woman asks me for a date," Sam answered.</p> <p>Emily giggled and Sam looked at her with his arms spread across his chest. She gave him a tiny wave, and he felt like a boy on his first date, who got to kiss a girl on her first date. But he said, "You're welcome, and goodnight," and walked off into the darkness.</p> <p>Samantha wasn't ready for what she saw next, because she saw Emily siting naked on the coffee table, with her eyes wide. Her mouth was slightly agape, while her lips were slightly parted, and she was smiling. The room was lit only by the flickering glow of red candles, just waiting to get lit.</p> <p>It was time to do what she had just been asked to do, so Emily quickly stood, pulled her clothes off in one go, and stepped into them. She looked like a Greek goddess, and this naked lady-woman-woman was ready to do a stripteaseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
