I knew you would. Oh yeah, give it you're got, baby. God you are good at that."</p> <p>I didn't even have to ask anymore, I had already taken her to town and was loving it.</p> <p>Laying on my shoulders was the most comfortable bed I ever felt and after an hour of lovemaking we drifted off into a peaceful slumber.</p> <p>* * * * * *</p> <p>The day had gone by nicely. I had decided I needed to go shopping so that day should end and would take me to the mall.</p> <p>Not that I hadn't enjoyed myself. That was just another thing to have happen once in a while: it was all about timing.</p> <p>I was looking for something to dress up for, and my wife had left work an extra hour earlier than I usually did. When she had left, I had been working on an outfit for my favorite charity meeting; that was my main mission. I didn't really see how the outfit was supposed to be.</p> <p>However, I had come in at the right time and got it in with a simple white, pleated mini skirt, white shirt. I even had my dark loafers. It was the first time I had ever worn a blouse without the skirt on. I knew it would feel good against my skin, but not a dress like this. Besides, it might look better when she was around.</p> <p>Going to a store I knew was going to be a good place to stock up on shoes. There were quite a few of them, and I chose a pair of 4 inch high, sandaled sandals.</p> <p>Once in the shoe section I found one I loved and looked at my shoe. It was white and I was hoping someone would wear it because it wasn't too uncomfortable. The heels barely reached to my knees, but I wanted to show that off a little with my outfit. Besides, that could be my new look and that was good.</p> <p>I also got into a whole new shop, all black leather. It only took me a few minutes before I had finished. After all, I had been doing all the shopping, not the sex toy shopping.</p> <p>"Honey, you are looking great. Just keep it in mind that you are getting the shoes, while you are here."</p> <p>I knew what he meant, but the look on her face told me more than I had thought.</p> <p>"I was going to try to wear this one on my first day and maybe if the suit didn't look too good I might. Would you think I should wear my new blouse like this, instead of this skirt?"</p> <p>She asked, as she tried the fit on her new shoes, "Would you mind if I did?"</p> <p>"No, I want to try all of them, just get it out in the light so you can see what they are."</p> <p>The suit looked good on her. It was very short, but very tight looking on her. It showed a lot of cleavage, if I had to keep looking and trying to peek. As the heels slid off her legs she slid them off and handed me one foot each. Just like my shoes she was only wearing thong panties.</p> <p>"I'm going to try this out on that suit," I said looking at it. As I stepped out of the shoe section I said, "Wow, it looks pretty good. Why don't you wear it the next evening when you come home."</p> <p>"I can always wear it and then take it home from the store. You are going to be glad you are here."</p> <p>With that, she got into the suit and I grabbed her purse. On the ride to the mall I was thinking to myself that I would need to make a few changes with her. I just might get lucky. I was glad I had picked the shoes she wore. She didn't have to wear too many. She looked great.</p> <p>I pulled over just as she was coming out of the store. She stopped, and I knew what she wanted.</p> <p>My hand went right on her cheek. I kissed her.</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yes, I will be sure. I have been looking forward to seeing you for years."</p> <p>"Wow. This is going to be fun."</p> <p>With that she reached out and took me in her arms.</p> <p>"Let's go get some dinner and a movie, then I will surprise you with something new."</p> <p>I looked at her and smiled. "We can do that," and we drove off.</p> <p>* * * * * *</p> <p>We got to the hotel and I went down the elevator to get my dinner. She went to the room quickly and I found the room was a little down on the end of the elevator. I was glad we were in the elevator because that meant I would be going down in theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
