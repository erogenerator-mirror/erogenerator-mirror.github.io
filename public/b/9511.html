But he had to ask. "Mrs. Jones, are you really pregnant. Is she pregnant with my child?"</p> <p>"Yes and yes, sir."</p> <p>"Are you all right?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes. It's all right."</p> <p>"Thank you. If it wasn't for the fact that you'd be pregnant with an old man's child - or if it was, you're a good wife."</p> <p>Bobby was shocked, to say the least. Even though it was no one but he loved her, who was he to judge? "I'm so worried about you, Bobby. I've never seen a woman like you. So fragile, so... fragile."</p> <p>"Oh."</p> <p>"No, you're not," Bobby cried, turning to leave. "Where is she? Where is Daddy? Are... are you okay?"</p> <p>Bobby walked out to the car and found that Mrs. Jones' car was still out the driveway. He pulled the car around to the side of her house, but there was no way for them to see it.</p> <p>"What is she doing here?" He asked the driver.</p> <p>"We don't know, Mr. Jones. We've just called."</p> <p>"Oh, I've never met a mother of two. Why do you think I never wanted to be the one to ask for a divorce? I never knew anything could be like that."</p> <p>Bobby pulled his car into a driveway that could be seen from every window. The house was large and well-kept. Bobby knew it was a good place for a father. But it wasn't home.</p> <p>"You don't have to come any farther, Mr. Jones. I'm taking you home, though."</p> <p>"But if that's okay, I'll come," Bobby said, holding his hand out in a shaky hand.</p> <p>"Thank you, sir. And yes, that's okay. But it's not okay for the husband to be on his own and go home alone."</p> <p>Bobby shook his head and turned his car around, headed back to his home. When he got in his home, he saw Mrs. Jones' house sitting on his front lawn. It was the biggest home any of the neighbors could have possibly afforded. There was a swimming pool and a large hot tub in the back yard. The pool was very large and had enough privacy to allow the man and women alone. He drove up and parked close to the door. It was the perfect house, he thought.</p> <p>"Where's Mom?" Bobby asked.</p> <p>Mrs. Jones shrugged.</p> <p>"We'll have to sit down and tell her," Bobby said, walking inside. Bobby had the house to himself so he didn't worry about it. He was looking forward to hanging out with the women and having his own home.</p> <p>He walked slowly over to the refrigerator, then bent down. He felt around, not finding anything like what he was looking for. When he found it, he opened it up and took out a large box of food, the same box he'd used for cooking and his own cooking.</p> <p>When he saw what was inside, he took it into his arms and hugged it, feeling like he'd never known such warmth. When he saw tears, which were running down his face, he realized what a miracle this was happening.</p> <p>"Thank you, Bobby."</p> <p>Bobby couldn't imagine how this day could ever happen again. He wasn't certain he could say or do anything. He knew he wasn't married, but it had been so long since he'd spoken to anyone in that way. They'd had a few discussions about it when they'd first met, before marrying on prom night. But talking about what happened in their marriage that night, it made him feel like a boy. Bobby took a shower and got dressed, then walked out to wait on the women.</p> <p>"Can you help me?" Bobby asked.</p> <p>"Sure, why not, Bobby? They don't know about their business, do they?"</p> <p>"No, I don't think that's a good idea. It's just too hot in here and the windows are closed. They'll see us together."</p> <p>Bobby reached out and started to turn away. "No, it's not a good idea. You shouldn't be alone at this hour of the day."</p> <p>"Mr. Jones said we could talk."</p> <p>"No, it's not about that."</p> <p>"Mr. Jones said he's going to be out late tonight."</p> <p>"No, please," Mrs. Jones shook her head.
