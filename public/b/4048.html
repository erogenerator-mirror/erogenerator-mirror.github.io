It seemed I was being passed around.</p> <p>The following Saturday. "My little girl," I said. "Are you ready to go on the cruise."</p> <p>"Oh God, I don't know. I don't even know why I'm doing this."</p> <p>"It's okay babygirl, just take your time and do whatever you want."</p> <p>"I'm nervous about that."</p> <p>"I'm so glad. Take a bath, shave your legs, that will make it easier."</p> <p>"Oh my God, you're touching my legs."</p> <p>"Don't worry, we're going to leave this afternoon early, and it's not even a five minute walk."</p> <p>"Oh baby. If you just relax a bit I might let you have the privilege of having the night off."</p> <p>I laughed. "I was hoping you'd say that."</p> <p>"If you let me have the pleasure of having the night off, I just might let you have the pleasure of having the pleasure of having the fun of having the night together."</p> <p>"I'm getting ahead of myself. I just didn't realize, if I did it, I could just go from being a good girl to being a terrible girl."</p> <p>"I'm not so little anymore. You can still have fun tonight if you want, but we can go swimming today."</p> <p>"You have the advantage of having a wet bathing suit on."</p> <p>"Oh, that's the one, okay. Maybe after the trip is over," she said.</p> <p>"Maybe after we just have a good nights sleep we can go and swim nude tomorrow."</p> <p>"Can I go first?"</p> <p>"You can, but if you want to stay a little late, go ahead."</p> <p>"You're not being very fair."</p> <p>"What's the matter with you?"</p> <p>"You've been trying for eight years to get me to open up. I just think you're a really smart girl."</p> <p>"I'm being a dumb girl," she said, before adding, "but I'm sure you've done some thinking and come to the right conclusion. Besides, you want a girl that you can talk to."</p> <p>"Oh really, I was just joking."</p> <p>"You have to admit, you're really smart."</p> <p>"Yes, but I'm still a dumb girl."</p> <p>"And I can't fault your logic."</p> <p>"Oh good, then there's not like I'm a wimp now."</p> <p>"Good," she said, putting on her sunglasses, and taking a step into the water. "It's a good thing we are going out tomorrow. I think I might not make it to the end of the cruise. I might make it to the end of the cruise because I don't want to spoil your surprise vacation."</p> <p>"I do have two surprises in mind, and I would love for us to go to a nude beach in Hawaii."</p> <p>"Good, because I'm sure that I have some other surprises in mind, too."</p> <p>Once we got to the deck, it was time to take off. I took a nice long drink of wine, and set my foot down and started to run. She followed me, sitting on the edge with her legs up in the water and her eyes closed. She held my arm at the elbow and my left hand went to her knee, just where her thigh should sit. I started to massage upward until she took my hand and placed my fingers right up the leg of my swim suit. She lifted her right leg on my lap, the very wet fabric rubbing my penis up and down.</p> <p>"That's really good. Are you sure you have another surprise in mind?"</p> <p>"No, I suppose not." I took more than a few slow sips of wine. "Well, what would you like me to do next?"</p> <p>"Lie on your back. Let me kiss you and fondle you for awhile."</p> <p>It was an interesting way of having her to myself. While we were kissing I slipped my right arm around her and her left arm around me, our faces very close together and our arms and legs pressed together. I could feel her fingers exploring my chest and stomach as she softly kissed against my lips then my mouth, then her tongue, before we separated.</p> <p>"Honey, look at me."</p> <p>"Do you want to be a mommy now?"</p> <p>"Yes, and just as long as we can do that again."</p> <p>"Just like always."</p> <p>She started to move down my swim suit, slowly, letting them slid up by her sides as she went.
