I'm off to the shower. That shower is the easiest part of the day... I'm really happy that I can come back to this place."</p> <p>"No, come here you idiot... you're ruining everything. I'm your husband and all that, but you can use my place for as long as you want, if you want."</p> <p>She leaned in to him and kissed him. As their mouths parted, she was about to pull away, but didn't. She kissed him harder once more, and her kiss was just as passionate as before. She felt as though she could burst into flame in it. "I'm going to miss this place. I really do."</p> <p>"No, I don't think anything could be as good as this."</p> <p>A few minutes later they were in her bedroom, where they made love for nearly an hour. She had made all the arrangements, but now there was a whole new world of meaning for their relationship. Maybe she would come back for more, they wouldn't know if it was just sex. Probably they would.</p> <p>Later that night, she was sure that John was going to fall asleep, and that's when she made him her own.</p> <p>"I just hope you won't kill me with your hands," he whispered over and over in her ear.</p> <p>She pushed away with her forehead on his chest. "I have no problem with that. I promise I'll be back whenever you want..."</p> <p>"I won't."</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Several weeks passed by as they explored each other's fantasies at the local strip club. But as the months wore on, their erotic interiors were becoming a bit of a struggle. A night with her husband, a show with her best friend, had ended with just a very intimate kiss. They were about to leave, when John leaned over and gave her a kiss that she couldn't help but respond to. His lips never left her mouth, and they kept right on kissing. It had begun without any conversation that night.</p> <p>"I'm sure I am gonna need a shower," he heard her say through the kiss, and turned back to her, "go ahead."</p> <p>She laughed a laugh that had nothing to do with being angry at him for kissing her. "Just get in there, and clean yourself up and go sit down."</p> <p>"No. No, I need a shower." She grabbed his hand and led the way into her bedroom. He quickly followed her lead, and she let go of his hand after they'd been in the living room.</p> <p>"I'll get the water going." She turned and headed for the bedroom.</p> <p>"Wait. I need you to put something on your back," he said.</p> <p>"You want me to get in the tub and you put the water on my back?"</p> <p>"Sure," he replied, and ran a hand along his neck before letting his hand slide down to her chest as she turned. She turned to face him as he put his arms around her shoulders, but stopped just short of taking his hand and rubbing in the water.</p> <p>"I'm sorry."</p> <p>"What."</p> <p>"Nothing. Go ahead and put off the water for a few seconds," she smiled, and he did his best to smile back at her. He was just thankful that she hadn't been in that tub for him the night before, as this shower was more of the same. Not that he minded it; the shower had been their first time, and it was something that made him enjoy it as much as it did her body. A shower is a shower, the water is warm, and it's always been nice to get to know those things.</p> <p>"I was hoping you'd like it, but if it isn't too... awkward, I would really like to... do it again."</p> <p>"Okay," she replied, and stepped past him into the bathroom. He followed her with his own shower, hoping to get the mood back on the couple.</p> <p>***</p> <p>"John," she said as she turned on her side to face him, with her elbow on the side of the tub. She was leaning against the door frame, smiling as she leaned toward him to kiss the side of his neck. "It's about time we made an end of the date. Don't you like being on my back?"</p> <p>John just smiled and nodded his head. He wanted to say something, he wanted to have sex with her again, and he didn't want to put on a show, but he didn't know how much of a show it would be when they got home to each other.</p> <p>"Is that right?" She gave him a playful push across the stomach before sitting back into the tub.</p> <p>"Absolutelyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
