Kelly laughed.</p> <p>"That's a lot of effort," Jen laughed, "you and I both know this isn't going to be a big deal after the weekend is up."</p> <p>"I'm not going to say that you won't be coming out of there tomorrow, but you have to remember -- you're our girl and we're your couple," Kelly said, "we want you to enjoy yourself."</p> <p>The rest of the night went well. Not one to miss a thing, they ate, and talked. They laughed and teased each other as they laid on their own bed in bed. They had a wonderful night together. The entire weekend went well, and neither of the guys seemed to be looking forward to it after all. They got to know each other, and then they got on with it, going to some stupid movie and seeing if they could keep this going.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Later that week, the guys decided it was time to move them into their room. The girls stripped on the patio, while the guys laid on the bed. They made the bed, went to the pool, changed the sheets and went to sleep. The next morning, Jen went to her room to get some more coffee and a paper, but after the guys had awakened and headed in to get ready for work, she went to her room and got a robe and some clean clothes. The first thing she put on was a short nightie, but then she made the bed again, went to get herself another cup of coffee and left her bedroom.</p> <p>The next thing she decided was to stop on by the grocery store to get a few things. A few minutes later she came out of the bathroom. She had on a bathrobe, which left her shoulders and arms bare, her nipples erect and pointing toward the world. Her nipples, while not alluring, were very sensitive, and she'd always enjoyed the feeling of a guy's nipples against her chest or as she got close to another guy. She had come to know them as being an erogenous zone, and had even once let one of her friends show her how to do them. In fact, she would show her friend how to do them in person at a later date. She thought she'd come up with a little kinky, but she didn't.</p> <p>Jen smiled as she saw her friend's breasts and nipples through her bathrobe. Kelly also looked at her friend as she stood there with another coffee cup in her hand. Both girls had their fingers caressing, massaging the muscles in Jen's neck and shoulders, while she sat and watched. She sipped her coffee, and then picked up her robe from the chair. Jen's robe was a small, one-piece affair that she seldom wore, because it fit her pretty well. When she moved it over to her legs, her nipples seemed to strain outward from the soft silky fabric of the robe. When she stood, it slipped up completely, showing Jen her nipples sticking straight out over the top of Kelly's robe.</p> <p>Jen walked over to her friend, and looked down at her nipple, pinching it slowly, and then cupping her breast. "I'm sorry to disappoint you," she told Kelly. "But you've got breasts that make my nipples stand out on this woman."</p> <p>Kelly chuckled, taking that as a cue to look up at Jen. She reached up and placed each nipple between her fingers, pulling it away from Jen's body. "You know, you could get away with it a lot, like we had yesterday."</p> <p>"Yeah, I've seen some pretty good breasts, you know." Jen's nipples were sticking straight out, from where they touched Kelly's robe. "Besides, you have amazing breasts. I love them."</p> <p>Kelly leaned down and took a nipple into her mouth. She sucked it gently, her tongue tracing circles around it and pressing at Jen's nipple as she did so. Jen watched closely as Jen sucked and licked Kelly's boobs as she felt her nipples tighten in her mouth. It took only moments before Jen found herself thrusting her hips out off the bed, reaching between her thighs and rubbing herself.</p> <p>When Kelly stopped sucking on the nipple, she leaned forward, kissing Jen's breasts and neck. "I think that you'd like to see a lot more of this." She moved further down, moving her upper body on the bed. Jen's breathing was hard and fast. Not one to turn down an opportunity to have an experienced woman, Kelly leaned forward and slid her fingers in Jen's legs from the inside of her thighs to her thighs, from the outside of her vagina to the bottom of her vagina. Kelly slipped her fingers into each leg and slid them upward toward Jen's vagina. Jen raised her legs, helping Kelly move the fingers through her outer lips.</p> <p>Kelly turned her face toward Jenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
