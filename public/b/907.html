He whispered to her as their lips met once more. He could no longer hold back his desire and he grabbed her body with both hands, one holding her, one holding her back and he could feel her shuddering beneath him. "Touch yourself," he demanded through gritted teeth.</p> <p>She shook her head and closed her legs, spreading her legs as wide as she could and he leaned into her so that she could feel his hardness rubbing against her slick flesh but he did not need any hint from her in order to know that this teasing that he enjoyed most had brought out the best in her.</p> <p>The first orgasm she felt was like a tidal wave washing over her. It rolled over her like tides before the tides. She was panting and moaning incoherently as one of her captors held her to his body while she shook uncontrollably and writhed beneath him. She looked like a helpless little child under his control and he savored every second, knowing that this was going to get her into trouble soon if he didn't let her go. She wasn't going to fall to her knees as his hands held her thighs spread tightly in order to accommodate him. She was going to fight like an alligator if he didn't let her go.</p> <p>"You want my seed? Huh?" he asked her, his tone demanding in a matter-of-fact way. Her eyes opened and she nodded frantically. "I do want it. I'm not a monster. If you really do want it, you are going to have it. This is your chance. I'll go wherever I want. Whatever it is that you want, don't ask." He leaned down over her, his mouth trailing across her neck, nibbling her earlobe. His hand slid down her body, feeling her tremble. With a single finger, he traced her navel ring and she trembled as he dipped the tip inside. He could tell the nerves that stood there that she liked it because they seemed to be in charge of her body. He toyed with her bud, feeling she was ready, wanting it to be explored. Her breath quickened and the vibrations of it were like an electric shock that made her body quiver.</p> <p>He lifted her legs and raised them to straddle his body where he pressed them on the small of her back. He slid inside her, the heat of her clinging to him, feeling her tightness give way to his hardness. "You feel so good," he admitted as he started slow and gentle in her, savouring the moment. He wanted to take her with no thought for her own pleasure but her need drove him on. He took his time with her, savouring every second of her innocence. She opened her eyes and stared up at him lovingly, his dark eyes telling her to say something. She didn't have to look too far. She only wanted to give him a taste for his seed; it was what she had been wanting from the very moment she first saw him at the bar. He had always been kind to her, not like some of his peers did. He didn't force it on her; in fact, it was his turn to take his time and enjoy himself.</p> <p>"Do you like it?" She nodded. "I will take care of you. Whatever you want. Whatever you need right now." He slowly increased the speed a little, thrusting into her, pulling out a little and teasing her inner walls with the head of his cock.</p> <p>She didn't respond to his request but it seemed to her as if it were an invitation to take the lead. She leaned her head up to his chest and her hands moved over his abdomen as she stroked him. He groaned as her fingers danced over him, her touch so sensual. He pulled back a little and lifted his hips. She slid him inside her and he could feel it, the feel of her tightness surrounding him. She felt so amazing. His breath caught in his throat as he began thrusting into her, taking her with no finesse. He could take this roughness no more, not without warning. He felt himself approaching the end that he had longed to begin but he needed to hear it from her.</p> <p>"Say it, my dear." She bit her lip and moved her hips, trying to push him closer to her own.</p> <p>"I love your cock."</p> <p>His thrusts were forceful, hard in contrast to the gentle treatment that he had given her. He pulled back until he was almost out and then plunged into her again, a little slower and a little more demanding this time, enjoying every second of her submission. He wanted a release so he slid out all the way and then thrust himself inside her again. He wanted her to feel it. He wanted her to feel him in complete command and love.
