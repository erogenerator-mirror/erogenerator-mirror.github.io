"I'm just enjoying these days."</p> <p>He reached down and took her hand again. "I'm glad you're here, my little petite sister," he said, and he was rewarded for his honesty when she took advantage of his moment to kiss him again. Her lips tasted so good on his, and he felt her tongue probing him in his mouth, dancing against his own before it was in a duel.</p> <p>"I know how much I enjoy sex, too, honey..." he said shyly. "With every boy I date, I make them think it was their duty to please me." They were kissing once again, and he was so glad for that. It was so nice to have a girl so willing to do things for his pleasure.</p> <p>They were both breathing hard as they broke the kiss once again, and he couldn't help but feel a little flushed as he took in the beautiful, naked woman he'd just met, but he felt better about himself than he would have otherwise. The fact that she was his sister, the fact that he saw her all those times only intensified the feelings coming from the back of his mind.</p> <p>"I like kissing you," she said. "It's nice to have the company of a handsome, horny young man like you." She pulled him close, taking his head in her hands and feeling for his lips with her own tongue.</p> <p>He returned the kiss with one arm and pressed the small of her back up against the headboard. He took both her hands in his and brought them up, and let them slide over the smooth skin of his chest, feeling the contours of his body and the muscles and tendons that were defined in his skin beneath. She closed her eyes and sighed as the tangle of his fingers and her hands brushed over the bare skin of his back and sides.</p> <p>"You're really nice, Chris..." She moaned in his ear, and his penis, hard as a rock now, brushed again against her thighs. She slid up to where he was sitting and pressed her lips to his. He kissed her back as she held him close while they shared a long, lingering kiss, his hands now roaming over her back and sides, his eyes admiring every inch of her soft skin.</p> <p>She broke off the kiss, and he brought her up against his body with his hands, and kissed her again, harder this time, pushing away so they could kiss each other's lips as passionately as they could. He was glad after a moment of kissing her he was able to find the button to his shorts without breaking the kiss. He began fumbling with it, but she stopped him. "No," she said, still whispering, "I want to see what it feels like to kiss a man. And if it's as good as it looks, well, just have fun."</p> <p>She slipped her hands under the band and into his pants and felt that the outline of his erection was clearly discerned there, even though he couldn't see it without being able to see it. She wrapped her fingers around the shaft of it and squeezed, causing him to groan a little and his hips to thrust up slightly, causing him to feel her hand on him. She pulled back and looked him in the eyes again, and he knew that she was really wanting to see if a man could really go for a long time. This was just like their first time together, and she wasn't really letting just anybody know about it.</p> <p>Slowly, she peeled him out of his shorts and underwear, her eyes never leaving his erection, and she let go of him as it sprang free. She was about to lean down and engulf the head of him in her mouth when she felt his hands on her hips, pushing her back against the headboard. "No..." she said. "You're not making it. Not yet. We'll go slow."</p> <p>He wanted to kiss her right there and just see what her reaction would be, but he knew that she had something they wanted to do. And so, he held his ground and kept one hand on her hips and one on her back, feeling her body against his own. She felt the hardness of his erection in her stomach. It was a beautiful thing to feel, and he had always known that she would feel it.</p> <p>She kissed him once again, running her tongue between his lips as he had kissed her, and she ran her hands down over his butt, feeling the skin between his butt cheeks, running her fingers down his legs, finally coming to rest between his legs. He reached down with his hand and felt what she felt like as his fingers began tracing it, feeling the muscles under the flesh and sliding his fingers in between them, feeling her shiver at justâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
