'I love your eyes, Alex,' she said.</p> <p>'Like those of a young man, not the first time I've been with someone my age,' he said as they lay together; her hands and arms went round his neck taking control of the situation. Alex found the situation quite appealing and he was really enjoying her being there in front of him and so enjoyed his hand gently caressing her bum. The idea of having the opportunity to explore her body and her personality was exciting and he knew his cock was stirring as it went along.</p> <p>They lay together kissing, slowly, enjoying each others' body. He lay on his side and she sat on his thighs; she was kneeling astride him with her bum resting on his lap and her thighs straddling him. He had a feeling of pride that she was a virgin and that she had only been unfaithful to him. His cock throbbed and he pulled on her bum which made her bounce a little and then she sat on him while she moved her bum back and forth. It was only a minute before they were both coming and she leaned forward pressing her arse down onto his stomach. 'I'm ready, my darling,' she said to him while she was still coming down on him. 'It'll be nice to do a bit more than that later,' she kissed him again.</p> <p>It was more like a couple of cuddles and she spent several seconds getting him erect again, then she moved on top of him and straddled his hips. She got him to sit up and she pulled his cock into her wet pussy and he slid up inside of her. She began slowly to move her hips and her small breasts bounced against him and he wrapped his arms around her and pulled her close while she lifted herself down onto him again. Then she began to thrust into him and soon they were hammering against each other with his hands holding her up and thrusting his hips up hard into her bum.</p> <p>'Ooommm, I'm coming!' her voice said before she began to squeal and cry out his name. Her head was on his shoulder and she leaned her face against the top of his shoulder and he pushed his tongue into her mouth. She kissed him again and he thrust up into her and she climaxed again.</p> <p>'Ahaaaahhh! Oh Jesus I'm coming!' she cried out as it happened, her body went into convulsions and he held her hips while she had another climax. 'I'm coming, I'm coming!' she called out.</p> <p>Alex moved his cock out of her pussy and she squirted all over his stomach and breasts.</p> <p>'That was wonderful,' he said; his cock stood out hard and erect now.</p> <p>'It was nice, yes, just yes.' she said looking at him.</p> <p>'I want you to be comfortable, this time,' he said gently stroking her. Alex was naked now and his cock stood straight up and it was almost as hard as it had been so many times before.</p> <p>'It's okay, I'm not as young as I used to be,' she smiled at him.</p> <p>She lay on her side again, her arm was across his chest, her thigh was rubbing up and down his leg. 'I'm glad we had this to do,' she said.</p> <p>'I'm glad it did because I really enjoyed it too,' he said.</p> <p>'That was just for me and that you made sure that you were okay with it,' she said.</p> <p>'I can say that I was okay with it,' he said.</p> <p>'Can you do a bit more of it again?' she asked him.</p> <p>'Sure,' he said. 'You've given a real good job, haven't you?'</p> <p>'I think so,' she said looking at him.</p> <p>'Do you think that you'll be able to do it again?' he asked.</p> <p>'I certainly hope so, my love. I want to do it again.'</p> <p>'Are you sure?'</p> <p>'Yes, I'm sure. I love watching you when you climax. Your body is so lovely and I love you as much as I just loved you,' she smiled at him. 'But let's keep it gentle for a while then,' she kissed him again. 'I wanted you to understand this,' she said smiling up at him then she slid down the bed. 'I didn't put on a rubber, I think you will just have to do it, don'tâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
