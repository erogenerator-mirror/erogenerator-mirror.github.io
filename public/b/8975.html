It didn't take much time to get the job done and I would soon be naked and exposed on the hood of the car. I had to go to the bathroom and wash my face before I got into the car. No one ever liked being in the car. Now I could stand in the darkness for as long as I wanted. All was silent, but the lights coming off in the window above my head and even the night vision on my body didn't change. I opened my car door and reached my arms out to it. As I walked away I wondered if I should take all my clothes with me so that my nudity wasn't so obvious at the next stop sign. No, I had to take my clothes with me, although I would rather not be nude in the car, but the thought of being covered up again was something I always wanted to do that night. Then I stopped, turned around, and went to the car.</p> <p>A few moments later I was in the car, naked as the day I was born. I saw the woman at the other end of the car and turned toward her. In the dark shadows of the hood of the car my body was illuminated and I had to turn to face her. With one hand I reached into the car and found clothespins that she didn't seem to notice. I closed my eyes and then slowly went the car to her.</p> <p>I took her keys out of my pocket. "Where are we going?"</p> <p>She laughed. "There are two of us. You are a very naughty little man that likes to do things that are a bit naughty for a while. You are going to enjoy this as I will keep you out of trouble. I know you feel sorry for me."</p> <p>I turned, pulled off the hood and moved on, getting out of the car and turning into her drive. Standing in the middle of her drive she opened her door. "Come on, let me open your car door."</p> <p></p> <p>She was an innocent in the ways of woman, as she asked me. As she stepped out from the car I stood behind her, my hands on her waist. We watched as the car turned left into her drive and then a few yards before stepping out. Stopping in front of her house I asked her, "Did you sleep well?"</p> <p>"No, not really. This is fun and exciting. I just don't want to scare you away."</p> <p>"I'm sure the fun will go on if you have a hard time getting the car unlocked before I do."</p> <p>"I'm sure that will do for now, especially for you. I am just glad we didn't take your clothes off. I wanted to see if you could get that thing of yours out of you before we start our adventure."</p> <p>As soon as we were out of the car, she took me by the hand and walked in that direction. "We should get the hood up and in first." I knew where that meant. I followed her to what I thought was the back of her house.</p> <p>She opened the garage door and told me, "Let's do this."</p> <p>We went in to the garage and I was just going to open the car door. The idea of closing the garage door was very appealing to me. She told me to wait while she went into the bathroom. When she came back into the garage she did the same. "Sit down."</p> <p>We sat on the seats of her car in the dark, in silence. We didn't talk, but rather only looked at each other.</p> <p>"I can't seem to get you in any of these puddles of yours, can I?"</p> <p>"No. It is alright. There is nothing that goes on in this garage except my husband."</p> <p>"But I love him." She put her hand on the back of my neck as she spoke.</p> <p>I knew this was not a good time to be so forward about where my life and my marriage would go any time soon. What I wanted to do now was to tell her what I knew was about to happen. I also realized that I was going to enjoy it more than I had the last time I was here. She asked me what they were that I planned to do, but it never came out that way. This was not to be one way event I was never going to feel as comfortable with any other life as this one had. There was to be no future of any kind. I wanted to do this and it was only going to happen if I had to and I was not ready. I was willing, but needed some time to make sure. "We will go out on your own property, I'll be by right after we do this, okay? I am in no hurry and I hope you don't have any plans?"</p> <p>She looked at me, waiting, almost like a mother who would turn toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
