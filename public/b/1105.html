I was about to fuck her husband, and then lose my husband back in the ring by having sex with another man to a bunch of people I despise, while she's at home. The thought made me shudder with fear, but at the same time I felt a sense of excitement at my new sexual freedom.</p> <p>"Okay," I said, "but let me wait about fifteen minutes while you decide if I'm the right man for you."</p> <p>We finished our cigarettes and headed into the bathroom. Our first session was quite hot. After we had showered and dried, we took a walk down to the bar.</p> <p>"This is nice," I said as I sipped a vodka martini. "Just like old times. Nice and relaxing. Just like old times."</p> <p>"Yeah, a lot of the younger guys have been hitting on you," said Kim, her eyes sparkling. "I could give you all I could without giving them all I have, but with a little less, well… I guess…"</p> <p>"You can give me little, but your little is all you have," I said. "You were just a little more. I could give you little all you had, but you don't care. You don't mind if I give you little; just give it little."</p> <p>Kim giggled and took a sip from her martice.</p> <p>"It was pretty easy for me," said Kim. "For the first six months I was the one in charge. I wanted to be nice to the guys, and have them want to give me little, but they would just think I was going to fuck the guys I wanted to fuck."</p> <p>"You're not fucking the guys," I said and raised my eyebrows. "You don't like to fuck, but I have a point here."</p> <p>Kim smiled shyly and then looked at her glass. "What did you want?" she said.</p> <p>"To fuck," I said. "You want what I want here?"</p> <p>"That's it," she said, a little wistfully.</p> <p>"That's all," I said and turned my back to Kim, who took the martini from me. "How about if we have another drink? I'll bring you one."</p> <p>"Okay," she said and leaned over to reach her glass. She handed me my drink and turned to me, and then looked at me seriously. "But don't try to have sex with others. We don't have the money, and you're not going anywhere. You will never feel right without the money. You love the guys, and they would love to fuck you, but if you love the guys, you better not get caught in their trap. So that's it. No, we don't have the money. You want me to seduce them, and I'll fuck them. There's lots of guys that can help pay their bill, and there is someone else to pay their fucking bill just to get what they want. You'll never fuck them. That's just sex, and you won't get laid. It's not that it's not sex. But if you love the guys, you'll only fuck them if they give you little bits. And that means that you won't give them little bits!"</p> <p>She smiled at me. "But," she said, and looked meaningfully at me. "It has been six months since I gave someone else little bits, you know how it is."</p> <p>I shrugged.</p> <p>"We can see that we can't stop thinking like that. I don't think it can go on with me anymore. And you won't care if I fuck you anymore," I said.</p> <p>"There's just something about the idea of you in the bar of a hotel with other guys that makes me really horny," she said. "You're going to love it there. I have no idea what I'm going to do with you that first night. And if you like to be a slut, then I'll be that."</p> <p>"Really," I said and sipped my drink.</p> <p>"I'm not asking you to come home, and I don't have any more money left, but I'm not telling anyone about it either."</p> <p>"Okay," I said and walked toward the door with her following.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>I walked into the room, got on the bed, and looked at the bedside clock. "Probably five minutes," I said.</p> <p>"How's it going?" Kim asked as I stood in the doorway.</p> <p>"It's going pretty well," I said. "We'll see about that. It's your idea."</p> <p>Kim had put on a robe—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
