Her arms were crossed, and her hands were down by her side, still covering her breasts and her nipples. That was it.</p> <p>He looked up and saw her eyes searching him for something.</p> <p>"How are you doing?" she whispered.</p> <p>He laughed. "I'm good."</p> <p>She raised her hand and it was immediately snatched away from her breast.</p> <p>"You are so hot!" he said grinning.</p> <p>"You haven't noticed." she said with a smirk.</p> <p>He reached down and found her right hand on his thigh with his own. He felt her squeeze him and he knew what was about to come.</p> <p>"Ah shit!!" he said suddenly as she squeezed him.</p> <p>"Whoa!" she said, a little shocked. "Didn't know you felt that way, huh?"</p> <p>"I don't know, but if you're looking at me for all I know, you're about to get a free show." he said as he pushed her back against the wall, her hand already cupping his balls.</p> <p>"Wow!" said her. "That was really fun."</p> <p>"A little. We might as well finish at the beginning and do it slowly."</p> <p>She was still sitting on the edge of the counter. Her legs were splayed a little, and not much of her pussy showed, but for a split second, there, he had an excellent view. Then, she leaned back, pulled him along with her and, he realized, her eyes never returned to his own.</p> <p>He moved around and stood up, still watching her hand. He pushed it back into her cleft without much resistance, letting her feel it again and again.</p> <p>"You feel really good", he said, looking down at her. "I could do this all night."</p> <p>"I'm already looking forward to it!" she replied, lifting her hips with each downward movement.</p> <p>He moved his arms around her, wrapping them around her legs and holding them off the counter. They both let out a soft moan, which started from their chests, then continued down through their waists and down the backs of both thighs.</p> <p>As he pushed and pulled them to him, her thighs would clench against him in the back and she would reach up and push back against him, holding out for as long as she could, until both wanted to do the rest. They were still moaning and he was kissing her neck and ear, enjoying the feel of her skin.</p> <p>She was breathing harder and she had her eyes closed and leaned in, her fingers touching his chest under a layer of his shirt. She didn't care that he was watching her, she just wanted to make sure every last ounce of her sex felt like it was his.</p> <p>They moved over a couple of steps and he backed up against the counter, pulling her toward him, still keeping his hands on her. She knew he was close so she pulled him in, then kissed him deeply. She wanted him to do it right, and she was not going to wait a second longer for him. Their kissing took on such a frantic urgency that they both had a momentary panic as to whether they should slow down or continue.</p> <p>He held her tightly as she pressed back against him, not letting him go until she couldn't take it anymore.</p> <p>"Oh, god, oh, god, oh, god, oh, god!!" she moaned into his mouth.</p> <p>"Let me just lay there while you can take it."</p> <p>"Oh, god, you're making me so horny!"</p> <p>His hands were already on her hips, and now they were rubbing her from behind. She could feel that his cock was as hard as a rock and that it was aching for some release.</p> <p>"You know, I can't stop you from taking care of me. I haven't gotten you naked in a while, you know."</p> <p>"I know. I just thought I'd stop by and say hi."</p> <p>"I can't help it. That body is so...tight. If you don't get naked soon... I'm going to be very embarrassed!"</p> <p>He was still stroking her leg when he said this, and she knew if she pulled back, he would be the one doing the job. She didn't want that, though. He was looking at her breasts and there was no room to touch them. Instead, she pushed up against his hands and felt his fingers go up into her cleft, pushing against just the head. Her breathing had become deeper as they kissed. As he touched the head, she felt it begin to swell.</p> <p>"Ohhhh!! Ohhhhh!! God, don't stop!"</p> <p>"Who am I kidding?" he askedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
