Just let the girls catch their breath." She grinned. I grinned back, she loved having to catch them out.</p> <p>I looked up at her grinning broadly.</p> <p>"Just one for the road?"</p> <p>"No just for you," she replied with a big smile.</p> <p>I looked up at her quizzically.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah?"</p> <p>"Yeah, if you're good I might even let my friend come in your room if she wants." She glanced down at her small but firm breasts.</p> <p>"Honey," I said with a grin. "I don't know why you keep putting me off. I get turned on watching your breasts."</p> <p>She laughed at that.</p> <p>She was still working the bottom part of my tie when the two girls emerged on the patio.</p> <p>"Oh," Kay said, with a little laugh that I could not figure out. I wondered who had gotten to her? The two girls had just disappeared into the backyard and appeared to have gone into the bedroom after I had gotten a chance to check them out after the show.</p> <p>I started to say something but stopped as Kay was standing up against the door and pulling the tie off of my neck. When the knot fell I opened up the door and stepped into the sunlight.</p> <p>Kay was standing there leaning back against the door with one arm over her shoulders, the other hand covering her large tits. She had a devilish look on her face as she watched my eyes adjust to the brightness in the sun.</p> <p>The two girls walked up to where I had been standing and both of them were now naked. Both had a towel wrapped around them and a large bunch of towels spread out on the ground. Kay had been watching me and I knew that it was both of us.</p> <p>Kay asked me if I would play around with her now so that she could see them both naked.</p> <p>I nodded okay and started doing my thing. She said, "Okay, let's do it, I like you touching my pussy." She pointed at my shorts.</p> <p>I nodded again and took a step back from where I had been standing. I had to concentrate on keeping my distance so I could watch out the window. I didn't want to leave Kay's view and I couldn't have moved if I wanted to.</p> <p>I stepped forward again and took of my t-shirt. I took of my swim shorts, then stepped back and removed my shorts. Kay said, "No," then leaned forward into the door way and pulled the towel up to her waist, exposing her big tits to me. Her huge nipples were hard and pushing out against the towel. I got my hand around her small waist and slowly started to stroke her back side as I gazed down at hers.</p> <p>Kay's hand dropped to the small of my back and slid down to my ass. I thought that she was going to rub it to encourage my hand to move any lower. She didn't want to just rub my ass or anything else.</p> <p>As she started to move my hand a bit higher she said, "Do you like playing with my body?"</p> <p>I couldn't hold myself back much longer. I started to say something but she pushed it away.</p> <p>"No, you don't want to touch me," she replied.</p> <p>I started to walk around me, as she held my cock and helped me back toward the patio door. I let her hold that hand on my ass without moving it.</p> <p>She said, "You know it turns me on when we're in the open here in the garden, to be able to see and touch you."</p> <p>She ran her thumb across the tiny opening of my asshole before grabbing my cock and guiding me back into the grass. As I started to get into my stride Kay put my cock back in her hand and started stroking back up to my balls.</p> <p>I put both feet on the picnic table in front of me with my calves and feet hanging over. Kay reached up and took of my shirt and pulled it over my head freeing my hands of my erection and letting my bare chest free. I took one of the towels and wrapped it around my waist. I leaned back toward the patio door and Kay did the same.</p> <p>Her hands were on my sides now, they were gently running up and down my sides.</p> <p>She said, "That's nice. Now, are you ready to see just how much I like you."</p> <p>I nodded and bent down a bit and looked in her direction. Kay had taken off the towel but was still fully clothed. I felt a warmth as I looked at her bare tit that I had almost forgotten she was wearing. I leaned slightly forward in my own seat and moved my hands up slightly toward her.</p> <p>There was enough light from the windows but I didn't want to see her tits whileâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
