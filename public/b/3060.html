And you were so special. You have no idea how hard I want to make you feel and how you make me feel. It's not the same thing." She says as she stands still and starts to remove her T-shirt. I'm not sure whether I like this or not, but I'm trying so hard to ignore what is a sexual magnet.</p> <p>Now that she is naked as I can see, we start to walk to the bed. The way she is, I can see her large breasts swaying, her nipples poking at the bra, and you can also see her dark pubic hair. Now we both want to make you feel like this. She sits down on the bed. I get in the middle with her. You lean down and start to lick her nipples as she starts to lick yours. "Let me get the straps off" You say. Without hesitation, I undo the straps and remove them. It seems as though you've taken very little time, and the feel of her skin is sensual under your hands. Then we kiss again. I move up a little so my erect cock is right in front of her face. "Take me, fuck me..." You say to me. I go to work on her, running my hands up the sides of her body till I reach her breasts. The bra straps have to go off. I help with the buttons. There isn't enough fabric to move the bra over her chest. You reach under the strap to unfasten it. I help as you reach and the bra comes away, leaving you in front of me naked but for your penis. You move between her legs so I can get the cups out. I take a hold around you and get the cup into position. You kiss her again. I slowly kiss down her to her breasts, then her belly button, and over her mound. Once the last piece of lace is undone, I pull the panties off. You notice for the first time the dark patch of hair below her navel. I kiss it, then the lips. Then to you. I get right down to her wetness and kiss her again. She lets go of me as my tongue finds its way into you. We kiss as I use my lips and tongue to lick and suck on her. Our hands start to do things that turn on even more with the feel of her pubic hair.</p> <p>She pushes me away, looks me in the eyes and whispers to me. "Let me take my panties off." And she lies back and spreads her legs for meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
