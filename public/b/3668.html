I asked.</p> <p>"I'm not sure about this... I'm not sure that I want to do this or what I mean but it's very intense"</p> <p>I laughed and shook my head,</p> <p>"No, it's not that. At the same time I'm trying to decide if I want to try to do this or if we're going to actually meet."</p> <p>"Just to get me started?" she questioned.</p> <p>"Of course I do," I responded.</p> <p>She paused before replying,</p> <p>"We're going to meet at one of the hotels on the beach in a little while."</p> <p>"Okay then. I'll come along now we can talk and I can find out more about this then just go to the hotel. You have anything else to be sure about?"</p> <p>She took another sip of her wine and grinned at me.</p> <p>"I've already decided to do it, and I know when I put a little time and effort in, and the more time we spend alone the better. I haven't given myself so much as my first or second date in a while that I'm considering this possibility."</p> <p>I smiled again, I had always enjoyed meeting women at the clubs, and the thought of meeting them had always been an added pleasure. I really enjoyed the thrill of knowing that they would not just be me or my own wife; they would be the most beautiful women I had ever seen and would have a full body and long blonde hair. And when they would come and be my wife; they could be my best friends, my lovers, the most wonderful and caring, loving people that I had ever met. I took another sip of wine and put a hand on the arm of the chair I was sitting in.</p> <p>"So what's on the agenda for today, Sandy?" I asked.</p> <p>"Well, it's a little early to get involved but I think we both have a lot to think about how this could go off," she said as she took another sip of her drink. "You're going to be my first and, if I'm honest, it might be my last too," she added as a last comment before getting to her feet.</p> <p>I got up and sat down in the chair beside Sandy.</p> <p>"Well, as you probably know you guys live about an hour and a half from us, I assume about ten miles so what else can we do?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'll get to the hotel," Sandy said as she pulled over in her own motor home, a smaller one than hers, and headed to the hotel.</p> <p>As Sandy exited the motor home, I sat there with my heart beating in my throat, my head in my hands.</p> <p>"What?" she asked.</p> <p>"Just so ya'd know, I wasn't expecting to find you here with Sandy."</p> <p>"So you're actually going to be with her," she said looking at me, confused and then at me.</p> <p>She looked around the small motor home, my guess was that she was looking at the ocean and not up at the buildings on the other side of the house. It had a single bed sitting right in the middle and was fully equipped. The two of us looked at the ocean around the bed and it made us all giggle when we saw a smile play across Sandy's face as she came to sit on my lap.</p> <p>"I... I have a little something for you, " she said and took my hand and sat down beside me on the bed.</p> <p>"So, what's it about?" I asked her.</p> <p>"I want to see it. I've wanted to get the camera and get pictures of the place with us."</p> <p>I smiled as her hand came to rest on my thigh and I could feel the warmth of her hand across my thigh as it rose.</p> <p>"I've told you already that I don't like crowds, but the sooner we do this, the sooner we'll be able to leave. And I feel so strongly about this," I added as I caressed the sides of her face.</p> <p>"I know what you mean, David," she answered as she kissed my lips.</p> <p>"We'll have to wait. We'll have to talk."</p> <p>"I need time to think about this. I'm not about to just run away and leave you."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yes, I'm sure," I agreed.</p> <p>"But why am I here?" she asked.</p> <p>"Because you're gorgeous," I answered, "and withâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
