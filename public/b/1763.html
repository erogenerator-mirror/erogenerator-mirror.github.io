He remembered it was the beginning of their junior year and she had said that she had been lonely and wasn't that it bothered her.</p> <p>He remembered he thought the same thing as the girls at school but he wasn't so sure he did know.</p> <p>He did what he did after he thought what he planned for the evening, he changed into his street clothes which came off right when he climbed into bed.</p> <p>He changed in his room and then went outside and got a bottle of wine and a six pack of beer which he had packed just in case he got a beer at the party.</p> <p>He brought his new suit and threw on some nice clothes then he went to the bar as he didn't want to drink when a man saw him from outside.</p> <p>He got himself a beer and was just about ready to get back after a few hours as the bartender had told him in his note.</p> <p>He got back to his apartment about two minutes before he heard the front door slam and a big woman come out of the door she was his ex girlfriend.</p> <p>She said she was tired and asked if he had a beer and offered him a soda or whatever but as he was still on his way to his apartment she said she had to use the bathroom; she was getting married that week.</p> <p>When she walked in the door she was dressed in a dress that showed off her body but she looked like everything she was supposed to look like.</p> <p>She was really pretty, she said her name was Julie and she was his girlfriend back in his house, and he was wondering if this would really bother him so he said no.</p> <p>She looked him over and smiled then she told him that she had seen him looking at her when he was working in his living room and he had gotten a good view of her legs and ass that he could see down her gown. She told him that it was a pity she came on to him, he was going to be the one who showed off her charms.</p> <p>She said it wouldn't bother her if he really liked what he saw and wanted her to show it more that just to get him alone with herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
