Once she was out, Jane got up and followed me. I was still sitting there, watching them talk and trying to figure out our next move. When my wife went into the bathroom, we both got off the couch and started talking. I started to walk over towards them and asked them, "What brought this on?"</p> <p>They answered each other in their own ways. "This time I'm going to get us both a lot of food and some time for real sex."</p> <p>"You're serious?"</p> <p>"Absolutely," said my wife.</p> <p>I then took a few steps back and stared at them, and then took a deep breath, my cock starting to grow again in my pants. I reached up and put my hands on Jane's hips and pulled her close and kissed her deeply as I leaned in to French kiss her. Our tongues danced lightly around each other and my hands started to feel up her body again. I had a hard time pulling away from Jane as the kissing continued and my hands slowly slid from her hips to her breasts. I ran my hands lightly down her sides and finally found her nipples. It felt so good to have them in my hands and to know I had them in my mouth. I started to pinch them gently, making Jane sigh, as she ran her hands over my head. I moved my hands lower, moving them across her stomach and onto her pussy and could feel how wet she was. My cock got even harder as I realized just how wet she was and I began to run my fingers over her. She was really wet and slippery and I started to stroke and rub it as I kissed her and licked her. I slowly moved my fingers lower and ran them over her clit and felt it throb in her pussy lips. Jane lifted her leg up a little, allowing me better access to her pussy. I brought my hand back up to her pussy but my thumb slipped in and down and rubbed over her clit, which made her jump a little. After a few seconds, she started to grind her pussy over my hand again and as she did so, my thumb pushed right back and my cock started to grow again. My wife took a step back and dropped her leg. She put her hands on the floor and started to move her hips towards mine, grinding her pussy back and forth. I looked over at her and we both laughed as I thought about how she came up with this plan.</p> <p>I looked down at her and said, "You are really wet. I think you will have to fuck me, or I will have to take you out."</p> <p>Jane just looked at me and smiled, and stood up, taking my hand and pulling me after her. We walked upstairs and went to our bedroom, where we turned on some music and sat down on the bed, both of us in almost our bare feet. Jane sat on my lap, placing her head on my chest and reaching down to touch my cock with her soft fingers. We danced for a while, the music still playing and we talked some, getting to know each other a little and laughing a little whenever we were so intimate, and just relaxed in our own little world of eroticism. We talked about it for a while and then I got up and took of my shoes, socks and pants and stood up, removing them and putting on my shirt. I sat back down on the bed and Jane sat up to follow, once again touching my cock with her hand. I took her hand off me and pulled it up to my stomach, placing her hand on top of my stomach, and then slid her fingers under my shirt, letting them run up over my chest and down to my sides. She moved over until she was straddling me and my cock was rubbing up into my stomach, which meant that my hands were all over Jane's body also. She moved her hands around and found my back and started to caress me down to the bottom of my tights, while looking at me with a smile I hadn't seen on anyone's face in a long time. She moved her other hand up and rubbed over my nipples to keep them erect and so I didn't have to say anything. We started to make out again again, our heads on top of the covers and our feet pressed together under me. She broke off the kiss, leaned back, and laid on top of me, not stopping touching my body, but running her fingers down until she had reached my balls. She started to stroke me as I ran my hands all over her body, feeling up her nipples and down to her pussy where she stroked over her pussy lips. We continued to make out for several more minutes, caressing each other's body, kissing and feeling each other, her finger in my mouth, my cock rubbing inside her, and me insideâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
