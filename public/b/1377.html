I'm gonna tell my dad."</p> <p>"I know. I can't go anywhere without him."</p> <p>"He is out of town, honey. He should be back soon."</p> <p>"Yeah, sure," she smiled. "I'll just keep it in mind to keep him busy for me."</p> <p>"Okay, mom," I smiled. "See you later."</p> <p>I watched mom leave the den. Suddenly there was a door at the back and I heard a voice call for me.</p> <p>"Dad, are you there?" I called back.</p> <p>"Sure," he said.</p> <p>"You have a phone?" I said, surprised to hear from him.</p> <p>"Yeah," he smiled.</p> <p>"Hi, dad," I said. "I think I'm stuck here with your mom."</p> <p>"Well, I was hoping you'd tell me," he said, not being one to lie. "I've been wondering if you'd see me again."</p> <p>"Dad! Sure!" I smiled. "Really, really, really!" I heard him go into the room. "Bye, k," he said.</p> <p>I closed the door and walked into the dining room. Mom was sitting at the table. Dad was sitting at the opposite end of the table from her. I could see tears in his eyes.</p> <p>"Mom, what's wrong?" he cried. "This isn't how it was."</p> <p>"It looks great," my mom said.</p> <p>She looked up as I walked in. She had tears in her eyes and a smile on her face. She looked like she wanted to say something but wasn't sure what.</p> <p>Mom lifted her face and looked up at me. Her eyes showed a lot of anguish and sadness. She looked as if she wasn't sure what she wanted to say.</p> <p>"I think I know what that means," she said. "I'll never get you to tell me again."</p> <p>"It means everything," I smiled.</p> <p>"Thank you, honey." She leaned back and took a long swallow of wine. "I know how much I have missed you and how much I love you."</p> <p>"I love you, too, mom," I said. I gave her a deep hug and started walking out.</p> <p>"I'm going to call Mike and tell him I'll be late," mom yelled after me. She stood up as I grabbed her and pulled her back into me. We broke our kiss and her face was streaked with tears. I felt so bad and felt so bad for what I had done. I had been able to give her what she wanted for so long. I couldn't believe that it would come to this and never happened. All it had meant was that I would help her. It had to be better than what I had been through in her. I took her back into my arms and gave her a deep, passionate kiss. We stood and cried on each other's lips once we broke it off.</p> <p>"That was amazing, honey," I said to her.</p> <p>"That was better than any experience I've ever had."</p> <p>"It really wasn't that bad?"</p> <p>"My mother was just too scared before, all over her," I said. "If you don't want me to do anything else with her, maybe tell me to call Mike. Just let me know and you and I can go our separate ways now."</p> <p>"That's probably a good thing," she said. "Mike and I will be okay, honey."</p> <p>"Yes, mom," I said. "Tell him I said hi and that the kids were okay."</p> <p>"Goodbye, honey."</p> <p>"Bye, honey," I said. I saw her smile when I said goodbye. I knew what I wanted. I loved my mom so much. I couldn't go back into her closet and have her cry in front of me. She loved me too much and couldn't bear that.</p> <p>I walked down to her and gave her a deep kiss as I got back into my truck. I was ready to tell her how much I loved her, but couldn't right now.</p> <p>"Goodbye," I said to her, stopping. "I love you, mom."</p> <p>"I love you, honey," she said. She leaned in and gave me a kiss that felt good. Our mouths stayed locked together as our tongues explored each others mouth. I let my hand slide down and slid my hand up her tight and sexy little nightie. She was wearing thong underwear and was feeling friskyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
