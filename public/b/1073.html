"I am going to get him and we are going to have a great romp. I'll make you mine, I'll make you my wife of twenty eight years, you'll never forget. What do you get in for me?"</p> <p>I got a sinking feeling when she continued.</p> <p>"You will fuck her, will you?"</p> <p>"Just like you want me to," I whispered. It was hard to hold back, knowing I had never been with someone like her. Now she was going to give me my twenty-three years again.</p> <p>As I opened the door, she said, "Honey, are you still there..."</p> <p>"Yes, dear. She doesn't know yet. Just go in there and get your cock back in action," I said.</p> <p>She led me into the living room and asked me to get out of my shoes. I did so. We went out onto the porch and sat next to each other on a couch.</p> <p>"I have to say that I am really glad that you are back," she said.</p> <p>"Thank you, that's the nicest thing anyone has said to me in years. You and those horses have always turned out so well."</p> <p>We sat there talking for a while about what she said.</p> <p>I told her what she did at school and what she had done and that I felt bad. But she asked me a question.</p> <p>"You have such a beautiful man in your life and are such a sweet guy?"</p> <p>I just said, "Just think about it. If you could still live up to the man you are, you would be able to meet a lot of beautiful women over the years so you wouldn't be such a loser."</p> <p>A big smile came to her face but she didn't give me an answer to that.</p> <p>"I still have a lot of questions, why didn't you come with me, when I told you where I was going?" she asked.</p> <p>"You had to come, honey. Besides that, I didn't answer your one question."</p> <p>"I know that but the other thing."</p> <p>"What?" I asked. I was really getting frustrated.</p> <p>"You know, like I said, I don't know where this is going. I want the truth. Please."</p> <p>"I wouldn't hurt you if I had to," I said.</p> <p>"You could let yourself in, you could fuck me."</p> <p>"All right, but I didn't expect this. Maybe not now but right now is better," I said.</p> <p>She just stared at me.</p> <p>"We'll see each other forever," I said. "I love you, you are everything to me."</p> <p>Then I started laughing.</p> <p>"Oh my God, Mary, you are beautiful," I said as she laughed with me.</p> <p>"All that talk about sex was hard for me to understand," she said.</p> <p>"It is easy getting around in the company, you know. And I will need to practice," I said.</p> <p>"Do you still have it?"</p> <p>"Yes, it is in my pants. Did I ever use it?"</p> <p>"No, you are going to have to find your way back."</p> <p>"I don't know how I will go on if I don't work it," she told me.</p> <p>"Maybe next time, you will have to have a little more."</p> <p>We kissed and then she got up and left. When she came back, I still hadn't said a word to her. She just came into the living room. We both sat there and she said, "If she isn't home, you can come back. I'd love to have you in my arms. The last thing I ever wanted was for you to feel all these feelings I've had. Just think about it, that is all."</p> <p>She said it back and leaned back against me.</p> <p>"The first time you get with someone else, you don't have to worry all the time. Just think about it."</p> <p>She reached up and caressed my face againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
