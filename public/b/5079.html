"I'm a big girl now, just like you."</p> <p>She led him to a nearby chair, put her shoes on his feet and lay down on the wooden floor. She lay beside him, her right leg laying against his left and her right leg across his, their naked pussies touching, teasing and playing in each others' sex. They both came in one orgasm and then collapsed in each others' arms, not even looking at each other as they both drifted off to sleep, completely spent.</p> <p>The next morning they talked about their dreams, and he confessed his dream that he had a special place in mind, the one of being a mother and her daughter that he had never known, and a special kind mother and daughter that shared his life story, including his dream of fucking a mother and a daughter.</p> <p>"Yeah," she said smiling. "Let's be honest. I've known them since we were kids, but I never knew them since I was their age. I don't know if I still think of them that way. I only saw them a few days ago."</p> <p>"Me too," he said with a laugh.</p> <p>"They'll be here in a few minutes and I'll introduce you," Kelly said leaning over kissing him, running her tongue over his lips.</p> <p>After a few moments she broke the kiss. "I'll be back in a little while," she said grabbing a pen and paper and leaving the room.</p> <p>Chris and Kelly were in their usual way getting up to get some breakfast when they awoke to find that their mother had gone home and was not around. They lay there in bed, cuddled up, listening to each other talk and smiling at each other for awhile. She had told him how they had both grown up together, but it was only a dream and they never went to college. He told her that it was really nice that she had not given herself to him anymore.</p> <p>She didn't say anything in response to that, simply got up and went downstairs to start breakfast.</p> <p>"Momma's gonna call me this morning and ask if I want a nice breakfast," Kelly said looking up at her daughter.</p> <p>"Sure," she said looking a the younger girl back down.</p> <p>"Well we need to go see if they are coming back here," she said looking down at the floor. "I need you and I know you need to tell me. Let me have the address of the place and I'll come and pick you up."</p> <p>She left, locking the front door behind her as she went.</p> <p>"What the hell," Chris said looking at the address.</p> <p>It was the house of a friend on the edge of town. Their neighbor had lived there before so they knew the property well. No sooner had they moved through the gate that the door closed behind them than they were inside.</p> <p>'I wonder why they didn't just tell us to come live here,' Chris thought to himself, 'but it doesn't matter now. At least until their friends get here.'</p> <p>Kelly opened the door of the large house they had just come from, a beautiful two-story white three-story house that fit just about every other description that we could get. In front of it was a wooden table set in a living room. She walked over and sat down in the kitchen.</p> <p>"Okay. They are coming home." Chris' heart began to race and he could feel his knees begin to tremble, he stood up and started toward the door.</p> <p>"Nooo. They won't go after them. They won't," Kelly pleaded, putting her hand over her chest, squeezing her breasts, hoping that he wouldn't take them.</p> <p>"I'm not going to stay here. I have work to do, you have to get yourself organized," he said walking over to her and taking her hand in his own.</p> <p>"I know," she whispered, "you can't take me home, not with your friends."</p> <p>"Of course not," Chris said, getting down in front of her. He lifted the front of her blouse and opened her shirt exposing her soft small breasts.</p> <p>"Don't hurt me. I'm a grown woman, you can take me home," she begged, knowing that they had to be stopped if they were going to get in trouble for it.</p> <p>He kissed her breast and ran his hands up her legs.</p> <p>"I can't, not tonight," she begged, "Please... just let me go."</p> <p>"We'll see what happens, we'll see," he said and kissed her again. He opened the top of her blouse and began to kiss her chest. As he moved his lips passed her breasts, his fingers touched her nipples and she moaned.</p> <p>"Mmmm," he said, "now we'llâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
