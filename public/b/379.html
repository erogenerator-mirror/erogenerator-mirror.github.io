She said, "Mmmmmmm, you're nice and hard." and slid up my body so that she could kiss my lips again. I could feel her soft breasts, hard nipples rubbing against my chest, a hot sensation that I had only dreamed about, but never imagined it possible in my wildest dreams, in my wildest dreams.</p> <p>I opened my eyes and looked at her. My lust for her was so intense I thought for sure that she would give in to me, but instead I got a stern look as she reached up and caressed my cheek. She slowly kissed me again then said breathlessly, "I think I have made my own decision. Now you are mine."</p> <p>I couldn't help it, she wanted everything I wanted, right down to the last second, and was really getting into it as she slid her fingers into my shorts. Suddenly I noticed I was still wearing my swimsuit. This was a major moment in my life I thought to myself. It had been years since anyone had touched me or had seen me. I was not about to let this happen this way. I had made up my mind that I would never let my wife leave me, and if she wanted me she had to let me see her naked.</p> <p>I felt her hand on my cock and she started to stroke me gently. "Oh God, Mike, you're so hard, it feels so good."</p> <p>I was shocked and thrilled by all the feelings and emotions that I had been feeling, what had been just a fantasy of mine. All I wanted to do was to do anything to her, to make her mine. Then again, I thought of the last time that I had made a decision that I didn't make but who is to say.</p> <p>She pulled off my shorts and I was naked as the day I was born. For a moment I thought that it was wrong but then I remembered watching her taking her clothes off during the day, and suddenly she was nude in front of me in front of me. I didn't care. I loved it. I loved everything about my wife. It was an expression of my passion. It was a symbol of my willingness to love and care her beyond anything. I really loved and respected her in that very moment.</p> <p>As excited as I was, I still couldn't believe that this could be happening. That maybe she would want to go back to her room and I would have to follow the path she led me to. I pulled her down until she was on her back again and my cock went right on into her, pushing her legs back until my pubic bone was against hers, our bodies touching in very sensual places where only two people could really have sex in the way that our minds think it is possible.</p> <p>I didn't want to rush into this, so I just concentrated on the feeling of her. It wasn't long before I felt like I had a million times the experience I had before. I loved her, we were talking like we did when we had just done what we both wanted, and it felt like that was the most loving experience of my life. There were just moments like that, like the way you have an inner peace while they are leaving. They are no different than how you have a great sense of humor under heavy water, which is why it is impossible for us to talk to each other at the water side.</p> <p>I had my cock pounding into her as fast and furiously as I could when I realized that she was cumming. It was like she was having a seizure and I saw her eyes rolling back into her head as she came all over my cock and on me. She really did love the experience and I loved it.</p> <p>After our bodies settled down we just lay there holding each other as we both tried to catch our breath. She turned so we were touching each other tenderly on her breasts to which I gladly offered. She said, "God, did I ever need this. I had not been with a woman in several years, or ever even touched a woman sexually in that way. Not even in my wildest dreams."</p> <p>"It was amazing, baby" I said.</p> <p>"It was your first time with a woman. I couldn't believe how much I enjoy it." She said.</p> <p>I asked, "Are you ready now?"</p> <p>"God, yes. Do you really want to do this?"</p> <p>"I didn't ask you, I wanted to. But I can't stop now."</p> <p>As we lay together and we said love to each other, I could hear her voice in my head, "I have to have you."</p> <p>"I don't want you to ever stop. You're doing wonderful things for me," I said notâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
