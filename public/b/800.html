She held on to me and kept me under control until she eventually pulled herself off me. After holding on her the rest of me fell into a peaceful slumber.</p> <p>But, a part of me felt confused.</p> <p>After she'd finally given herself a moment to come to her senses, I heard another sound. As though someone was being pulled back by some type of force! Then we heard the sound again. This time, with a different kind of force.</p> <p>This time we heard, "Are you okay?"</p> <p>A voice I recognized, "Yeah, I'm fine."</p> <p>"I just needed to get back to work," "But, did you need anything else from the store?"</p> <p>My question surprised her. "No. I was just thinking about the time you gave me the money for the last store."</p> <p>"Oh, and were our sex lives the best you could have imagined?"</p> <p>That made us both laugh so hard, we both nearly burst out laughing ourselves.</p> <p>"No," "No," "I mean really." She looked at me again, "How was your night?"</p> <p>"Same as always," "Good, and you." She looked away, "I was having so much fun, I guess I shouldn't have let that old guy get away again."</p> <p>"Really..." She looked over at me as I sat there in her arms, feeling the weight of her there on top of me. It felt so good to be held like that, with no need for physical exertion. "I have a confession," she began. "I enjoyed it."</p> <p>I looked at her. "Really?"</p> <p>"Well," she said, "There just seemed so much more to do when I was in my apartment, and more to do with something else."</p> <p>I looked at her. "Well I'd say, sex seemed to only last a few hours."</p> <p>"Yeah," she blushed, "We really did enjoy it."</p> <p>I looked at her. "You're amazing!"</p> <p>"I know I say that just once," she sighed. "But I think something's wrong with me about you."</p> <p>"Oh? Tell me," I reached out to touch my finger to her cheek. "Don't be embarrassed."</p> <p>She smiled and said, "I love you."</p> <p>"I love you too," I touched my finger to her chin, "I just felt I needed to share my feelings."</p> <p>"Thank you," she pulled back to look me in my eyes. "We have our share of issues, but we have the time to share them."</p> <p>I smiled at her, and kissed her on the lips. I was surprised by first meeting her but her lips felt soft and delicious. She surprised me by kissing me again as well, with as much tongue as there were. I held her hand as we kissed.</p> <p>"You're so responsive," I touched her finger again, "I can't wait to get back to work."</p> <p>"What time is it?" she asked.</p> <p>"Almost time for me to start the final preparations for the next set of customers," I said as I kissed her once more. "I want to go home and relax."</p> <p>"No," she pulled away from me and said, "I really don't wanna come over, so I guess I better get ready for work." Then she turned and started walking the length of the store towards her place.</p> <p>After an awkward silence, I put her hand on my neck. "Have fun," I said as I kissed her lips one more time.</p> <p>With her back to the cashier she asked for my card and put it on the counter. "You do that," she sighed. "I'll see you at work."</p> <p>When she turned to walk away from me, I looked at her, wondering why we would be alone together for so long. She smiled and kissed the back of my fingers. "You're gonna love it," she smiled.</p> <p>I was just about to say something when she said, "We need to take this to bed. I'm exhausted after a day in here."</p> <p>I just about managed to say, "Do you have your credit card?"</p> <p>When she looked at me, I saw a flash of something in her eye that I couldn't place. Then I found out it was a flash of something darker in her eyes that made my heart skip beats or feel a wave of dizziness in the lower regions of my lower body.</p> <p>"Uh yes," she smiled and stepped away. "Thank you."</p> <p>After she closed the register and led me by my hand to the elevator, I felt her arm goâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
