I nodded and continued with what I had been thinking about since I had brought the envelope home to him and placed it on the coffee table. He stood and turned for me to face him and I said,</p> <p>"Please do not think I was going to do this so soon, I was just thinking that I wanted to try getting into his pants but was afraid to tell him how I felt. I hope that it worked for you though. Thank you."</p> <p>In that moment, he asked, "Did you like it?"</p> <p>I said, "I liked it at first and then I just had to find out what felt good. It was amazing and you make me feel so connected to you."</p> <p>He reached out and grabbed my hand and pulled me to him and said, "I have something for you, you know you don't have to take it."</p> <p>He pulled me into him and we kissed and touched each other as we walked in the room. Our clothes were on the floor and I was trying to get the zipper on his button down shirt. Finally, he got the shirt off and we walked to the bed in full nakedness. We fell back onto the bed and started kissing and touching and exploring each other. I was on top and he was still on the bottom. He wanted me to roll on top and he laid me completely on my back and then he rolled and lay on top of me and started kissing and sucking on the nipple of my breasts. He started kissing down my abdomen before moving under my arms and started kissing my thighs and then working up to my panties as I felt his fingers pulling them off. As he moved back a bit I lifted my feet to do it for him and to help him along. His kissing went all the way up to my hips, then back down and then back up again. Then he moved up to the front of my legs and kissed them and moved up to my bellybutton and kissed, kissed, kissed my stomachbutton as he moved back up on me to the back of my thighs. His kisses ran up and down the sides of both sides of my legs.</p> <p>He looked up at me and said, "I have to touch you."</p> <p>I lifted my bottom up so he could move my underwear off and as they came off I felt his fingers moving up and down my crack locating my little hole. He was surprised at this. I told him that I didn't want him to just stick his tongue down there as he would have to push it in with his finger or a finger to get it in. He seemed to like that as he continued to work me as he worked my lower lips and then worked all the way back to where his tongue was going. I lifted my body up to give him better access and he took the hint and moved one of his fingers up and started pushing it in and out making it wet.</p> <p>I raised my legs higher to allow him to get access and he went back to work, this time making it easier.</p> <p>I could feel my orgasm building as my body moved around underneath him as he worked me until I had a mind blowing orgasm and collapsed back down. As I settled down, he went back to work licking and rubbing and I felt him moving down my legs just as slowly as he had done before and once he was at my clit as slowly as he had been I again felt his tongue on me. He was moving in and out with quick jerky movements over the small area as I moved my hips up and down and he could not last much longer. He must have known what the right thing to do because he increased his pace as I reached my last orgasm and collapsed back down on the bed as I climaxed again and again. I felt him standing up and my body went numb on me as his hands held me up so I didn't fall off the bed or hurt myself.</p> <p>When I got my breathing back I looked at him and I saw that he was still naked and looking at my body with concern and he asked, "What are you worried about?"</p> <p>I said, "I have no choice. I have been so horny that you probably didn't care to wait for me and just fuck me."</p> <p>He got up and went to the bathroom as I looked up and wondered about it, why would he do this? What would I do for him when one of us wasn't around to care about anything as we took it. It didn't really matter because they were gone and my body didn't need them any more.</p> <p>He came out of the bathroom carrying a very hard bottle of what I could only call hand lotion and went about his business as I looked through the drawers of the medicine cabinet. I found some of my favorite moisturizers and we spent the rest of the night in bed. In the morning, he had to tell me not to think about it because it wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
