I heard him moan and moan and I just kept sucking him as long as I could till he exploded in my mouth, shooting his hot stuff into me. I drank it all up and licked all around his shaft and his balls, tasting the salty pre cum.</p> <p>He said "Well, now you know how a man tastes. Why don't you take things a little easy?" He helped me up off the bed and guided me to the bathroom. He started the shower and turned it on. We both stepped into it and he just leaned against the shower wall, kissing me and running his hands all over my body.</p> <p>All I could do was lean my body against him and let him lead me around, getting in the shower.</p> <p>We rinsed each other off...well I did after all. He led me back to the bed and put me on my back. He slid all the way up until his cock was between my legs. He pushed in and out of my pussy making me feel like he just loved me. He lifted his leg up and I wrapped it around his torso so I was getting almost exactly where he was fucking me with his leg. Every time he pushed into my body, a wave of pleasure washed over me and I thought I would faint.</p> <p>With his legs still holding my arms as he fucked me with them, I wrapped my legs around him at the same time. The feeling was indescribably good, but what I really wanted is to reach over and hold and play with his balls, to stroke him, so I just let it go and just enjoyed it.</p> <p>I was about to reach another orgasm when he pushed into me and held his weight up as he exploded. He was going at me so hard and long that even his dick got sore against me.</p> <p>He pulled out of me just as his body started to go limp. He got out of the shower and he and I just stood there a minute. I turned to face him and said "Thanks, I needed that."</p> <p>"What did I ever do to deserve a second chance? Do you want to do it again?" He said as he gently wiped the drool away from my lips.</p> <p>He reached down and kissed me as he said goodbyeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
