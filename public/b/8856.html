I'm not kidding."</p> <p>"No, no. It just seems really weird, like I had no idea. I'm not the world's hottest guy, you know."</p> <p>"I hear, but it's just that you're way cool to meet all these people. They're really fun."</p> <p>"It's not that bad," I said. Then I felt that familiar pang of nerves like the ones that make you want to go out and find a good girl.</p> <p>"You don't have to feel that way."</p> <p>"But what if I decide it's not so bad?" I said, putting my hand on his arm and feeling like they were falling out.</p> <p>That's when I realized that I really hadn't even considered the fact that all those people that work for our company were coming over and asking, "Can I maybe work with your resume or not?"</p> <p>"It's not up to me," he said, and we both laughed.</p> <p>"Seriously?" I couldn't imagine a job more likely to be full of a guy.</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess," he said, and then he smiled and added, "Well at least I'm being honest. I only have a vague idea of what that's like," He said.</p> <p>"But I want to," I said, and we looked at each other, and he said "Okay, but only because I'd have this, what, with your resume?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess that's kinda it. But do you know what you want?"</p> <p>"I think I do, but maybe I'd just be less comfortable having the whole thing. That's why I ask, 'How much do you think you could charge?' And you're supposed to tell me. So if you want to, it's a deal. But if you're wondering, you can still do that, and we'll work something out, and if you don't feel that way, let me know."</p> <p>They looked at each other, and they both looked at him. He smiled and said, "I'd have really liked if you have my resume."</p> <p>"Okay," I said, and felt the weight of my fears leave my mouth in a flash.</p> <p>~~~~~~</p> <p>Our work schedule went by and I realized, at some point, that I hadn't actually asked them, but I think at some point the people from outside worked for my company. They probably came here to go over some papers or to discuss how the company was doing, and that seemed like it might be an important topic I had to address. As I got closer to my next deadline, the questions started getting more and more personal, and it seemed that the closer we got to an answer, the easier it would be for me to just throw a lot of stuff away, but I was pretty sure I didn't deserve to be sitting there when they came around and asked me questions about the product of the business, or what kind of training the company had required.</p> <p>"Why am I sitting here?" I finally asked them.</p> <p>"What's wrong, John?" Sarah asked, and they both looked at me.</p> <p>"It's the company," Sarah said, suddenly sounding less confident. "It's not my job for the Company to sell product this way, and all that crap."</p> <p>"I dunno, man," I said, but then grinned. "I don't wanna be here." I added, "It's not like you're going to be here."</p> <p>"Is this why you're sitting here?" They asked.</p> <p>"It's part of the job, if you want to be on it. It's not like we can just be together for a living," I said.</p> <p>"Maybe that's a good thing. Just let me get my resume out and let me know what I have to look forward to," Sam said, and then he took my hands and put them on his arms.</p> <p>"No, don't," I said, smiling at him. "It's like you're really not really the guy who gets off to you now." It turned out that the next day, we got the 'company' to give me the application I need. "It's not like you were ever going to say no to it, are you?"</p> <p>"I don't think I've ever said no to anything," Sam said, and then he grinned. "You have an attitude, John. It makes you feel special."</p> <p>"Then why can't I?" I asked, but I already knew the answer.</p> <p>"Well, because," Sam said, â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
