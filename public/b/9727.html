"Yeah, I remember we were on the sofa in the bedroom and the lights were out."</p> <p>"Oh, you do remember being very noisy this afternoon." she said with a smile. "I'm glad. I just had to sit around trying to sort through my thoughts and figure out what it was really about."</p> <p>"What were you thinking about all that time?" I asked.</p> <p>"Like I said, I was not really paying attention. It was so easy listening to you."</p> <p>"'Oh so easy'?" I asked. "You know, I remember what you said after work."</p> <p>"Oh yeah, I know. That was it." she said. "I kept on trying to put it out of my mind and make peace with the fact that we hadn't fucked in over a week. Oh, it was just so easy."</p> <p>Her words made me want to say something else. What would her reaction be if I suggested she might like to have an adventure with me? What would she say, or do?</p> <p>Instead I spoke, "Well, the real question is, are you going to tell me?"</p> <p>She looked at me thoughtfully. "Do you want to?"</p> <p>"Well, yeah. I don't think you're thinking too rationally, and that will be fine. I just would like to know if we can go to a lot of that stuff, if you can keep talking."</p> <p>"Well," she said, "it's just kind of funny that I always go to work after work. This is just one thing about my body, but it's really different how you look. You could always see in your mind that I was doing stuff, but that was just because of how I was dressed."</p> <p>I saw the look on her face as she looked towards the wall and said, "Oh, that's not true."</p> <p>"It's a lot of fun, I admit," I said. "You're so easy to talk to, too. I'll just bet you're thinking all that stuff now about that girl in the office?"</p> <p>"Yeah, we'd probably get caught in that line." she said, smiling. "It's hard to explain."</p> <p>"Do I get to play a role with her?" I asked, not at all looking forward to the answer.</p> <p>She thought for a moment. "I'll tell you when we can do something about that." she said.</p> <p>I wasn't sure how to play it. In fact, I was kind of thinking it might not be in the best interest and not want to play the role.</p> <p>"Well, I still don't know how I would feel about going anywhere with somebody if the woman in the office had to be really nice to me."</p> <p>"Good luck with that. It's been over a week since you last had a real date with a woman."</p> <p>I laughed. "Really, you wouldn't mind if I did this with her? The idea of my girl in there looking over my shoulder at my little ass. If you get my drift."</p> <p>She laughed. "Hey, you're not making any sense at all. If you want to go out with me, that's fine with me, but you don't have to pick me up. There's no way I would let you out of my sight again if you didn't ask. We don't have to stop and go or whatever."</p> <p>"Look, let's just make the arrangement work. If we do something, it's not for free."</p> <p>"Good. I like that. I'll set the pace then. Why don't you put me on the couch right away, in case we both need relief before you get home?" she said.</p> <p>"Sounds good to me, thanks," I said.</p> <p>And it did. We actually managed to have a good, enjoyable conversation. We enjoyed each others' company, talked and laughed and she seemed to like having a serious conversation, especially if I could bring her along to some things and she'd listen to it. It was really great.</p> <p>That conversation began with us going to lunch, then having another cup of tea as a way to clear our heads. It wasn't so bad. We were able to be civil to each other without losing the sexual tension.</p> <p>When we left the restaurant, she said, "That was the first time I've ever had lunch without having anything else to eat."</p> <p>I replied, "That didn't happen a lot. We were eating at the same Chinese place and had lunch."</p> <p>"Yeah," she said, "then I remembered we had lunch in a place that had a long walk in it because I knew it'd run out during rush hour. I really liked it there."</p> <p>We got back toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
