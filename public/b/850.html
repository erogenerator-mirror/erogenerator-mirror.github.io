I asked, grinning at him and then shaking my head as we both laughed. "You're not serious. I can't do that!" he complained. "I need to go."</p> <p>"Ok," I said, "let me know what you think. I can buy you lunch. But don't be late, ok? I'm gonna meet at the store for something."</p> <p>I walked back to the bar and walked by the front desk and saw that she was there. "I'll be right back," I called and walked back to the bar for more beer.</p> <p>When I returned I was surprised to find a couple standing there. "Who?" he asked in alarm.</p> <p>"You'll see. Go to the door and let yourself in," I said, walking towards him. I stopped a good twenty feet when he stopped and extended his hand to me. "Here's my number."</p> <p>I handed him the key then walked back to the door, unlocking it and stepping inside while letting the door close behind me.</p> <p>A couple of minutes later the door opened and there stood Trish. "Hi there," she said. Looking over both of us she said, "Nice to meet you, Rob," she said with a smile. I took the chance and walked over to embrace her.</p> <p>"Yeah, and it must be a pleasure meeting you," I said, taking her hand and giving it a kiss. "Did you have a good time?" she asked with a smile as she looked over both of us.</p> <p>"Oh yeah," I said, shaking her hand. "I just have a great time."</p> <p>"You too," she said with a huge smile. When she leaned over and gave Rob a deep, passionate kiss I could feel the tip of my cock brush against hers, causing her to moan.</p> <p>"I could do with a better one," Rob said as we broke the kiss. "Is that what this is all about, you can do anything you want with me."</p> <p>"You better believe it," I said as I moved over and gave Trish a hot kiss. I lifted her shirt up and her breasts were on full display as I continued to kiss her. "So what do you think? Can you do this?"</p> <p>"Oh yes!" she replied, grabbing my head and pulling it against her chest and groaning as she felt my lips.</p> <p>"Can I take you home and make love to you?" I asked.</p> <p>I stepped back from her and saw that she was looking around the room with a look of confusion. "But I'm married," she said. "I don't think I can do this. This isn't right. I still have the house."</p> <p>"You're married to me, Trish," I said with a laugh, "I'm the one that wanted to put your wedding ring on you, remember?"</p> <p>"That's not what you're talking about," she said with a grin. "This could save your marriage and your family."</p> <p>"It's a long story. Let's start over, shall we?"</p> <p>I pulled her to me and we started kissing. I gently lifted her shirt up over her breasts and dropped her bra on the floor, followed by my free hand. "How about the top?," I said.</p> <p>She quickly undid it and set it aside. "Do the same to me," she said, pulling off her skirt and panties.</p> <p>I stepped back to kiss her again as we pulled each other into the middle of the room. I had a vision of my face and the expression on it. It was the expression of a horny man. I'd given myself a full dose of Viognier with one Viognier as the main course and one Viognier as my dessert. Trish knew what I was thinking and I had a thought of what my wife would look like naked with half of my cock sticking out of me while my wife was fucking another guy. I couldn't believe how much I wanted to see it; how much I wanted to fuck her, to make her come, to watch her come on my cock, to watch her give in to the pleasure of it.</p> <p>"Is that what you'd like?" Trish asked as she pushed me back against the bed. She ran her hands down my chest to my cock.</p> <p>"I'm not sure," I told her as she opened her robe and pulled off her panties before laying back. I started to undress myself but Trish told me, "Wait." She quickly undressed.</p> <p>Once she was stark naked, Trish turned to me and said, "You'd better put that thing in then," as she dropped her top on the floor and slid onto the bed for me.</p> <p>My cock jerked and Trish laughed. "I didn't say you canâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
