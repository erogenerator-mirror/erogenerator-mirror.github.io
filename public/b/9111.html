I'm also sure it was well after 1am on a Friday. I'd had a full breakfast and some coffee before I went the next morning, so I had a quick run through the house to start with in the kitchen, to make up for my over-eager bladder and to fix a quick breakfast before I went to the airport.</p> <p>The second place I picked out was the beach house with its large, overgrown trees. It was almost 1am when I arrived but I made sure there was enough beer and some juice for me to get by without getting sleepy. I'd been to the beach before a couple of times. It was great, especially at the moment it was crowded. So it was a welcome break from my usual daily routine of shopping and drinking.</p> <p>I drove around the shoreline to the beach house, stopping with the sign on the gate. A handsome young man sat on the front porch with the sun shining through the trees. He had his arms wrapped around me, kissing me and telling me how much he loved me. Before I'd even gotten my first look at him at the gate, I'd stripped and climbed the steps to the top to let him in. I was hoping that he'd just show up as I'd been talking to him about his trip the previous day. I'd had more than a bit of fun while still at the beach.</p> <p>I walked down the steps and gave him a big hug and kiss on the cheek to assure him that I wanted him to see me more and that maybe we had a little chemistry that I didn't understand. At his surprised expression I grinned and told him that I just wanted to spend more time in the house by the pool. He had followed me into the house, following the pool, watching me in the back-lighting beams. When I'd finally finished with him I'd seen his smile and I got instantly aroused, just from watching his gaze.</p> <p>"Let's stop here for a sec." I told him and stepped out. I walked over to where he still stood watching the other people on the beach, my feet almost touching the floor. "I think we'll find you something to put on. I don't think you want me to go swimming with you, do you?"</p> <p>He walked up to me, putting his arm around me and gave me a big kiss, a few short ones, but not yet the sort of thing you want in public. He pulled me close and held me for a while, his lips on my shoulder as we stood talking, his right hand reaching under my shirt to squeeze my left bared boob. I held his wrist and he started to move his hand up and lower my shirt, caressing my right breast. "God it's been too long. Do you want me to take off your shirt?"</p> <p>I took my shirt off and handed it over to he, looking in his eyes as he took it and we were both laughing as I slipped my arms through his. When we were both exposed, I couldn't help noticing that his cock was still semi-erect. I leaned forward and pressed the kiss that I hoped would lead to our first time together to his lips. When he parted his lips and gently ran his tongue across mine I almost came. I'd hoped we'd try something, now I saw our first chance and I pushed back, putting my hands behind his neck and pushing my tongue into his mouth.</p> <p>"Take everything off baby." he whispered against my lips, his hand pulling me closer to him. I wanted to hold him, but couldn't and soon I was naked. I lay on the lounge, my legs spread as I felt his hands begin to unfasten my jeans, the zipper coming down easily as he pushed my jeans off my hips and off my body as they fell to my feet. I didn't feel as though I was fully naked as the clothing I had on was so thin that they made it nearly impossible for me to see the hard, throbbing cock and bare flesh straining against the thin cotton. I let the denim drop off my foot and put my arms over my head, reaching behind and slowly and silently pulling the bottom of my bikini underwear as it came over my left buttock, baring my naked body on display. The shorts that he was wearing were almost transparent, a soft brown, almost as pale as my skin. I watched his face as his eyes got a brief glimpse of my pussy as his hands moved down my body to the waistband of my panties. He slipped them down to the ground and began to run his hands over my stomach and up over the cheeks of my ass as I sat in the lounge, wearing nothing but aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
