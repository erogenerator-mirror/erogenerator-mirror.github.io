I asked.</p> <p>He looked like he had a small bulge in his pants.</p> <p>"Nancy." He replied a little hesitantly but, he seemed perfectly content to follow my every movement.</p> <p>"Please don't go any further." I responded, as my fingers danced across his bare chest.</p> <p>He looked at me with a twinkle in his eye. "I'm serious. I think we both want this, but we're still in a relationship and we just can't get...oh."</p> <p>I started to pull away but he grabbed the back of my neck and pulled me back down onto him. At first, his kisses had only a little bit of excitement to them. They were still soft, almost tender, but I wanted the passionate, aggressive part right away. I wanted his body to feel that it was meant to be with a woman. I also wanted their desires to be clear and not be wasted.</p> <p>"We can't do this until dinner. We'll have dinner after tonight and..." I began but I stopped, waiting for him to continue.</p> <p>"Before we...you know," he started, stopping himself from finishing himself off. He had become somewhat self conscious about his weight and it seemed a bit overwhelming. His blue jeans were tenting at the crotch and his cock had somehow begun to soften in response to the sudden exposure.</p> <p>"Before we do this, I've wanted to do this for a long time. I think it would actually hurt a little to do this." I reached over and took his hand and placed it on my breast.</p> <p>His eyes were locked on each of my words, looking at my chest, the tips barely perceptible even as he caressed and fondled my hard nipple. I had never thought this would be so...wrong...to do to me. He ran his fingers gently over my nipple, feeling the texture of my skin but, there was something that he could do. He began to rub his fingertip around my areola, feeling the soft ridges under his fingertips. He pulled his finger away from my chest and slowly, sensuously, he began to move his finger tips over my nipple. He then closed his fingers round my entire breast in a circle and moved his hand from my nipple to my areola. I felt him grip and lightly stroke the skin around my nipple with his thumb, but his touch was firm but so soft. He continued for a while, occasionally changing to explore more of my breast with his thumb or to gently pinch my nipple, but never actually touching the nipple. His other hand was now lightly resting on the underside of my breast and gently stroking over my nipple, which was now as hard as it had ever been.</p> <p>I wanted him to continue, right then and there, but he continued his actions and was softly massaging my nipple with his left hand. I closed my eyes in relaxation, enjoying his soft, gentle touches, but knowing that something was going to happen soon.</p> <p>In the end, I couldn't wait any longer. I removed his hands from my breast and moved my body away from his. I took a breast in either arm and gently squeezed it. It felt so warm and firm and the sensation made me very sleepy. I slowly moved my body over and straddled his leg. I sat on his crotch and gently rubbed the tip of his cock, feeling the tip at the entrance to my vagina, which was already wet with excitement from our earlier activities.</p> <p>"Oh God..." He moaned and I grinned at him. He just grinned back as he felt the dampness of my vagina and rubbed it along the length of his shaft. He felt extremely aroused and so very sensitive at the same time. I started moving my body up and down over his cock, enjoying the friction of his skin as I moved my lips over his cock. My lips rubbed against the swollen, veiny organ every time it became erect and his cock slowly throbbed and twitched. I loved the feeling of it in my hand and the way it slid as I moved my hips on him, grinding it along his length. My vagina was so wet and warm from my previous arousal. I felt his cock sliding along the length of it and he groaned slightly and closed his eyes. The feelings of heat, moisture, tingling excitement and the slight discomfort of feeling his shaft move in between the lips of my wet vagina were just out of the blue. His cock throbbed inside me in a way that was both erotic and indescribable. He groaned out loud and lifted his head with a look of lust on his face. I moved as much of his cock as possible between my lips. His cock felt so hot and hard inside me all at once.
