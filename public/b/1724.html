She was working to look every hour and it showed, and for her, it was a little obvious. Her short, curly red hair was pulled back into a pony tail with bangs dangling down her shoulder blades, and her bangs framed her cute little nose and the corners of her eye. The blue-green eyes were slightly parted at the corners and she caught herself looking down at the water bottle in her hand. I could clearly see a tiny bit of her freckles, and her little waist was pulled together nicely against a flat tummy and a pair of small breasts barely concealed beneath.</p> <p>"So how do I look?" Maggie said, leaning back in the tub.</p> <p>I nodded, "You look great."</p> <p>"You look like you really do, sweetie. You've got a nice body, you're not too bad, aren't you?" she asked.</p> <p>I nodded again, and smiled. I leaned over so I could lean into her and she leaned in so our lips could meet in an open mouthed kiss. The kiss became fuller, more passionate, our tongues dancing and darting as Maggie pressed her body all over mine. Her hands found their way to my neck and she squeezed me through my shirt for a bit, but then pushed her hands to my shoulders, kneading them and then moving them around to rub my chest beneath. She pushed our lips apart and her tongue moved to graze the tip of my tongue as we kissed.</p> <p>I pulled away from her for a moment to pull off my shirt and Maggie gasped when my erection poked at her thigh. I pulled away again to pull her into me just as her breasts caught my eyes and bounced as she came back into the tub. She slid her hands up my chest and under my arm pits to caress my back and shoulders as we kissed, and then she ran her hands down my arms to caress my chest while her hands ran under my arms and over my biceps. I grabbed her ass cheeks and squeezed them lightly to keep her in place as I pushed her against the wall of the tub.</p> <p>The kiss moved from deep into our mouths, getting deeper and more passionate, our tongues pressing together into a wide open maelstrom and our hands explored each other, touching wherever we could reach while the water was running. In a short minute, she pulled from the waist of my shorts and sat on the edge of the hot and bubbly tub, raising her knees up as it sunk into the water level with her feet, holding the rim around her pussy in a vise-like grip, pushing her body up toward me, pressing her head back as she continued to kiss me with a passion I had never experienced. I moved to join her in the tub and my dick was still out of sight on the other side of the wall but its shape was obscured by the water, and I couldn't see in any clear direction from where I was. I climbed into the tub with Maggie and we sat facing each other as our tongues went to work on each other.</p> <p>"That was so incredible, Sweetie. You taste as good as the first time we kissed." I kissed Maggie back and my dick slowly rose as I turned my head and we were once again kissing. I reached down on my right side and ran my hand along her thigh. "Did you want to do that again?"</p> <p>Maggie giggled, "Only if you want to, sweetie. I really did remember what it was like to have someone else make me feel really good."</p> <p>I slid one hand down between us and felt the moist heat between her legs. She grabbed my thigh and pulled it, my knee, forcing my leg farther out to the side, and I got a good look at her pussy. I could see it was already pretty wet and was slightly pink, with small, pink lips on each side. Maggie's eyes were closed when she said that, her mouth open as she breathed. We kissed. I slowly ran my hand up her thigh until my fingers came around the top of her hair and I gently massaged her scalp. Maggie's chest heaved and her nipples were pushing through her bra almost against her skin as she reached up to kiss my neck. Her breathing was getting faster and faster and she pressed her lips against mine as our kissing got louder until she grabbed my erection and squeezed me to her.</p> <p>She kissed me softly, "I thought about just fucking you again like last time, so I figured it would be nice to be inside you."</p> <p>"Is that what you want to be doing with me?" I said, sliding my hand under the water and into the waistband of her shorts and down the inside until it reached her pussy.</p> <p>She pulled my hand off and slid it inside, the water flowing between her fingers into my palmâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
