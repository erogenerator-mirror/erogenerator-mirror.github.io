The idea of me being angry at her was like nothing I'd ever experienced. The guilt of what I did was almost too much for her.</p> <p>"If you like, I'll be in here with you every day and day and the first thing you tell me is, "You want me here right now, and you can just ignore your own anger." You can't be mad at me, and it doesn't bother you?" she asked. Then she saw something like a look on my face that she had never seen on her before.</p> <p>"Well, I guess I just needed to know if you are truly okay," she said.</p> <p>"It doesn't bother me," I replied. "I'm not angry at you. It's just that... this has been a week and a half."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I know I'm not the brightest bulb in the box," Sarah said.</p> <p>"Maybe that's why you're so angry with me," I replied. "It's been way too long since the breakup,"</p> <p>"I'm not angry," Sarah said. "So I guess I'll just deal with it."</p> <p>"If you aren't really angry with me, maybe that's the problem," I answered. "But I can forgive you or you can just ignore it and not to blame me again,"</p> <p>"Alright, I'll forgive you," Sarah said.</p> <p>"Good," I said. With that, I gave her a hug and we went to lunch. Her first reaction was to go home and change and spend the rest of the week with me. It took us both a while to sort out the mess we made, but we managed. After lunch, we just kept hanging out with each other. The last time I spent time with her was over a year ago -- I had been with her a couple of times a month for over three years. That's how I ended up with that apartment.</p> <p>It was in a different part of town that we spent a lot of time, and the first opportunity that I got to tell Sarah about it was after a couple of late nights at the café the following Thursday. We chatted for about a half hour, then Sarah asked, "Why are you here this time?"</p> <p>"Well," I started. "My girlfriend is back in town for the weekend. We have plans to have a little reunion with her parents, so I came by to take her home."</p> <p>Sarah and I continued to hold hands while we talked, and although no one had ever been in a relationship with anyone in the city, we became friends a little bit. We talked for a while longer.</p> <p>"I'm sorry for interrupting you," Sarah said. "I'm just so glad you're here, I'm going to miss you."</p> <p>"I told you I can't stay here," I replied. "I really need to take a shower. It's about time I showered,"</p> <p>"I'm sure there's some good stuff in the shower at the hotel," Sarah said. "I can show you the way to the bathroom and you can have a look at the facilities there."</p> <p>With that, we both started to leave the café.</p> <p>"I can't wait to see you in the shower," I said to her. "See you tomorrow."</p> <p>"See you tomorrow," she said—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
