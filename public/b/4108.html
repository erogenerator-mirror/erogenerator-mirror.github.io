I do not want you to leave this house," he said, the look of concern coming over his features.</p> <p>"We should just leave," I said.</p> <p>"We should not leave," said Joe, "we are still here and we cannot be left alone until we find our way back home."</p> <p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh, we need to leave," he said.</p> <p>In a strange way I was beginning to see the problem. Why could this little girl and boy be as good as she was?</p> <p>"You see our problem, Joe," I said. There was no escaping the truth, the girl was so desperate, she could not just walk out of here, so I suggested, "We could still go with you."</p> <p>"But we want to leave!" she cried out. She was crying so hard and so loud I could not hear her over the sound of her sobbing. The poor thing had no idea where we had been, and didn't even know how we had found her. I looked down at her, she was still crying so hard and so loudly but that could not be helped. Maybe she had been crying for a long time and was afraid she would give in again, but Joe was not going to give up the chance to find out. If he hadn't stopped by, perhaps she might have had a heart attack. "I am not leaving our house," he told her firmly.</p> <p>"But... but if your going, let me," she said. Of course my wife was as stupid as me, maybe even as stupid as Joe as she would cry. I don't know, maybe that's why I kept on talking to her, to help her, because at the time I thought she might run away and find some excuse to run in this crazy neighborhood. Perhaps she was right. Maybe now she would get over it. Or maybe we could save our marriage. At least the house was free and we could try anyway.</p> <p>"No, let's go," said Joe, "that was worth our time, if you understand."</p> <p>We were on our third car. I looked at her. There was still a tear or two running down her face, but the look of love in her eyes was replaced by the fear and depression she had carried on before in our marriage. Not to put a finger on what we had been doing, but the way we were feeling right now, even though the boy was not there, we had come home here, and that was right.</p> <p>I started to back out of the car. No, the girl was not going to run. She was going to run, but I was not going to give her the chance either. I looked back, Joe and I hadn't been gone long. In front of me was the empty, and I wondered, if she was ready to face that at any other time. She was going to be afraid and afraid that he would come back and find some reason to throw the car at us. After all, he had never actually left this house and he had taken a lot of time to do it. I was not going to give up on her, if only for a chance at something worth saving. Maybe we could try. Maybe there could be something we could do to save our marriage.</p> <p>But I thought about the man who had carried on for me years. That had been just the man who had made me the man of my wife and, after all, I really was a man. The man who had given me hope and joy for so many years. And when things got worse from the second date (the third) I just knew it.</p> <p>"Please," she begged. "Don't stop now. We can start the journey back home."</p> <p>It wasn't her begging. It was some sort of pleading or pleading, or maybe pleading her to stop our lives. If she didn't stop now we would never find my car and go back and live the rest of our lives with each other again. She was getting desperate. Why else would I be so afraid to give her a chance?</p> <p>But it was true. There was not much to fear. The last ten years had been crazy and frustrating and miserable, but so much the same. Maybe we should just let it die down and be happy after one more day like this. Maybe I would let her go home. Maybe, maybe we could get married and raise all our children together. Maybe there would be no more problems after this was all over. So what if she stopped running out of Joe's life with a little effort; what if she took his life with a little more effort?</p> <p>Joe started to drive away, "I'm sorry," he said, "it's not necessary. All you have to do is ask, I can't give you up, there is no longer aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
