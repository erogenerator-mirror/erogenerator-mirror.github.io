The man had a better one!"</p> <p>Her son tried to protest but she cut him off with another kiss for good measure. She began unbuttoning her own blouse at the same time trying to get her son's tongue deeper into her mouth.</p> <p>"So you like to be kissed. I thought you liked kissing." "Maybe we can't be incest. How old are you? I mean, how old are you, and I'm not..."</p> <p>He was interrupted by a sharp slap on his arm; it caused him to stumble out from under her. "Shush! I'm not your mother. I'm not supposed to..." "You really believe that? Mom, who's the real father or whoever? You're just one of those girls who... what did you call that? What's his name?"</p> <p>Trying to calm her own nerves, she tried to tell him everything. "He's Jack, and I married Jack when I was a little girl. Oh, he was a real nice guy, but we weren't close. We dated for about a year and a half and that's it. We got married and were married at the end. And we got married in a special way. After the wedding we got in a private session where I was on top while my husband would use his hands on me.</p> <p>Once we got married he made me stay with him for a couple of months. He didn't have to spend much time with me in the same room. And he didn't have to kiss me or anything; he could just use his hands on me. It made my life easier. But I was afraid, so I just hid under things when I was with you and Dad."</p> <p>"But in the first couple of months, I knew it was just a matter of time. I just went along with it because I loved fucking you. I thought it might be different for you, but you never felt the need for a little intimacy. And it never seemed like you were ready to do it."</p> <p>"Yes, but then I thought of it and it happened. And you're the one who taught me," she said softly.</p> <p>"Oh, so you think it happens."</p> <p>"It happens, Jack. And it happens all the time."</p> <p>"Maybe it would be different with Mom."</p> <p>"No, it doesn't, but I am curious. Do you even know her name?"</p> <p>"Yes but don't tell any one about this. No one will believe it's us. But you, Jack, I... I hope you're still going to feel good about it."</p> <p>They both sighed. For the first time, she was glad that it was over between them. She couldn't imagine Jack still in her life.</p> <p>"Okay, so, maybe you have a little problem with it," the mother said as she gave her son's hand a quick squeeze. She was just a couple of inches from her son's face once again. "But before we do anything else, I want you to know that I never felt pressured or anything. I've seen enough of your father to know what I feel. And I've also seen a little of your mother."</p> <p>"You want us to go to the room with you and just talk until it gets past your mother. Is that it? Are we really ready for a proper honeymoonâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
