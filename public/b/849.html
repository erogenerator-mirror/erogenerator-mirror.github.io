"Besides, we can go home, I can clean up the mess I made."</p> <p>"We better go now," he said in a whisper, pulling her back up to meet his lips again. "I can't believe we're doing this." He kissed Stephanie, their tongues battling against each other, while he reached down and cupped her ass.</p> <p>"No," Stephanie replied. "I need you inside me. I need you inside me right now." She pulled away while they broke their contact and turned in the hallway, looking back at him. "I need you inside me right now."</p> <p>Stephanie walked over to a drawer and took out lube. She knelt down and handed it to him, sitting on the bed and rubbing the slick substance all over his cock. When his dick was hard, she guided it to her pussy. She pushed down, taking him into her core. "Oh, you feel so good, baby," she breathed into his ear, as the head of his cock rubbed the entrance to her cervix. "Make me your woman."</p> <p>Stephanie had never felt such passion in her life, and she wanted more. She wanted more than kissing her boyfriend. More than seeing him fuck her friend and her roommate. More than fucking him. As she looked up at him, tears of frustration and pain welling up in her eyes, she pushed her lover to the edge of the bed, pulling him down with her. "Fuck me, you stud," she cried. "Fuck my pussy."</p> <p>He smiled back at her, then got off of the bed, his cock dripping with anticipation. Stephanie wrapped her arms around the back of the chair and took over, pulling him onto his knees. She held his cock in one hand while she guided him on the couch where she laid back and opened her legs. "Fuck me, baby," she moaned. "Make me cum."</p> <p>The words sounded almost too good to be true, but he couldn't help but laugh softly as he slid back in to her.</p> <p>"You're going to make me cum?" he teased, looking back and forth between her face and her pussy.</p> <p>"I don't think so," Stephanie assured him. "I can't wait."</p> <p>"You're going to make me cum," he reiterated. "So, why don't we lay down for a moment? You're still hard as a rock when I get back, I think."</p> <p>"You can't leave me alone in here with you," Stephanie protested weakly. "I don't want to put you out of your misery like you did me."</p> <p>"You don't have to do this if you don't want to," Mike said. "Just do it. I know how much you need this." The way Stephanie looked at him, the desperation in her eyes, the desire and want in her voice, she knew he needed a turn out. Mike took no chances, not because of Stephanie's obvious desires, but from the way she looked at him with those eyes, she had a wild look about her.</p> <p>"Let me," he said. He moved aside a little bit so that Stephanie could pull the rest of his shirt off. She got it off, then sat back on the couch with her legs open. As she stared at his naked body, she reached down and grabbed his cock, feeling the length and thickness. She took him back into her hand and held him as she leaned forward and put his head at her entrance. "It's so beautiful," she moaned. "Can we do it?"</p> <p>"I don't think it's too late." They could hear a few pained sounds from the bedroom now, and from Stephanie's soft whimper. She was already slick with anticipation, as it was already dark already. But she knew Mike couldn't wait for her to cum. He might have some experience or experience with this, but he wanted to make a man very happy. So she pushed up on her elbows to encourage him back, then back down on him again. She was determined to give him a turn for good, so she slid his dick along her lips, and then back to her pussy. "Do you like me fucking you?" she asked as she squeezed and pinched his balls.</p> <p>"Oh god," Mike groaned. "I guess I do. You're so fucking sexy."</p> <p>"Are you still hard, honey? You want me to make you cum?"</p> <p>"I'm already pretty close to climaxing," he told her as he put his hand over hers to stop her from squeezing.</p> <p>"I want you to cum in me," sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
