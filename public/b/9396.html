You know how much I love to hear you speak at all hours." Her husband was out of town on a business trip for the next couple of months and he hadn't been able to come to the funeral where the funeral was being planned for them. He asked his mother to drive them home because she was going to be working late in the morning due to exhaustion. She would call him the night before. "She loves you so I'll call her later. I'm leaving the following day."</p> <p>His father was a large man, with a long beard and a large beer gut. He'd been married to his bride only a few years before. And he was divorced just before he met his wife for the wedding. He'd divorced two women before they were married and they took him under their wing. He loved his wife to distraction.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, Dad. I shouldn't have said anything to you."</p> <p>He thought about it as he drove towards his mother's door. "I know, Mom. I'll be fine. Bye."</p> <p>"Don't be an idiot, baby. You're home to make dinner tomorrow. I've got my own place to be proud of."</p> <p>"Yes, Mom, you are proud. I couldn't have made things easier for you with us having a new wife."</p> <p>Tom had not been very successful in keeping the conversation light with women. Most were still his own age and some of them knew nothing about sex. And his mother would be glad to give it to him if he were interested in her. She did have very good taste in men. But then again, if it was something special like a nice fuck, it was a pretty good fuck.</p> <p>After driving off the freeway, he walked to the back door that was located just off the back of the house. It was one of four double doors. He knocked loudly on the door frame. His mother opened the door and held out her hand to open the door. The door opened a little. Tom saw a little hair on either side of her head in the entry way. He was surprised for a mother to open a door in such a formal manner. He did not see anything unusual about how the place had been opened. He could only presume the neighbors had seen him enter to say hi.</p> <p>She gave him a warm smile and closed the door. She turned and faced her son in law for a few moments. "You were looking after your wife, weren't you. I was a little disappointed. You're not the man I married, are you? I couldn't see either of you in the wedding reception. Did I interrupt something? I don't think so." She shook her head. "I'm sorry, baby. But you're only half of what you were before the wedding. I'm just glad you were home to make dinner." She turned and hugged him, which made him feel all warm and tingly inside. Tom couldn't help but be glad that his mother was in his arms. He wondered what her reaction would be if he had made the next two days of dinner plans. He was glad he wasn't just standing there saying goodbye. He was also hoping she felt the same.</p> <p>It was difficult for him to find his way out of the house. He didn't want to leave, because he knew what he was going to do when he left. He was a married man. And he had to wonder what she thought of him. As he drove, he saw that the lights of the two houses in front of each side had been changed in one of the bedrooms. He saw the lights on the couch and on the coffee table in the living room and he saw a light on in his mother's bedroom. He knew his mother was very sexually active and he wondered if she would be able to help him out with something, anything.</p> <p>Tom parked the car near the front of the house and went inside. He went to the kitchen to get the soup and water. He had a glass of wine and was pouring it to keep his mind off the situation. The room was dark, and it was a little chilly in the kitchen. He stood at the end of the counter with the soup spoon on his lap. As soon as the spoon was in his fingers, he felt his prick start to harden. He took a long pull on his wine and wondered if he could get aroused. He felt his dick starting to throb.</p> <p>His mother was standing at the kitchen counter, with her hands in her lap. Her long blonde hair hung down to her waist. She had on a black babydoll gown that was low on the bustline, and the straps on the shoulders showed a lot of cleavage and shape to it. She was wearing high heels and he could see they had a big heel on. Her feet were bare. He was glad she didn't realize he was standing there.
