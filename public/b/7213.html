He asked. "I have never done that before."</p> <p>"No!" She said instantly. "You're just not as big as a boy."</p> <p>"Then this is what you do?" He asked her, moving his cock out of the way, rubbing it in the wetness between her legs with the head of his cock.</p> <p>"No!" She said again immediately, pushing him away from her.</p> <p>"Then if you really need, let me know." She said again. He could feel her body relax a little more as he leaned over her, leaning over her with his cock pressed hard against her body between her hands. Now he had her hands.</p> <p>"OK!" She said finally. "But let's be real sure!"</p> <p>She leaned him back again and pushed him back. Her legs spread wide and her fingers rubbed the head of his cock back and forth along her slit in the wetness, pushing it around her clit a little at a time.</p> <p>"Wow!" She said. "I don't know if I can really take that." She said it as if she were ashamed of herself and a little embarrassed. She liked the look of him as he looked at her, and she liked the thought of what she had said.</p> <p>He reached down with one of his hands and ran his fingers across her breasts again, finding the nipple and rubbing it as he slid his fingers up to it. He loved the feel of her breasts and her areolas, and she liked being touched and fondled. Now he slid a finger over her clit and started to rub back and forth like a feather, slowly, teasingly, until it was hard and tingly.</p> <p>She leaned her weight back onto his fingers, and her hips started to make little up and down motions that felt good, but it wouldn't be the whole thing if she didn't take charge of things. She rolled over, pressing her mouth back against his and starting to kiss him deeply, her tongue slipping in between her lips and finding his tongue, dancing between her lips. After a minute, she pulled away. "Well, it was a bit more than I thought it would be. You seem to have gotten a rhythm going and you're hard as a rock!"</p> <p>"Not exactly." He said. "I just can't seem to get my attention. Well, maybe I should have taken the initiative and started getting to know you better so I could get to know you better too."</p> <p>"That's probably all you'll get tonight." She said. "What's your name anyway?" She had a coy tone to her voice. He didn't know what a "C" was, or even what a "C" might be, just that she was a nickname for a person of the same name. He couldn't believe either that his mind was being driven by a fantasy.</p> <p>"I'm Brian." She answered. "It's nice to meet you!"</p> <p>"Likewise, Brian." He said. "Do you ever make love in your bed?"</p> <p>"Not on a regular basis." She said. "But we just sort of get together once or twice."</p> <p>"Oh, we do." He said, his hand cupping her hip. "I've never been with a woman before and I love the way you taste."</p> <p>"It was your name? I'm not sure I'm ready for that. Or that I'm ready to do anything." She smiled. "Let's get you hard and then see where it takes us."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"And that's it?" She said looking at him.</p> <p>"Sure. That's what I'm here for." He assured her. "Are you ready to go?"</p> <p>"Yes!" She said standing up. Her hands were still at his sides. "I want to go."</p> <p>"What happens next?" He said.</p> <p>"I just want you to do the right thing." She answered, leaning forward and starting to kiss him again. He held her face in his hand and kissed her deeply once more. She started to pull him down to his back, and he grabbed her hips and stood her up, her hands holding his hips. Slowly he pulled her close and they melted together.</p> <p>She felt his cock under her, sliding against her leg, and she moved over slightly, feeling it moving along her thigh. He kissed her again, his hands pulling at her shirt, dragging it off and sliding up her back. Her shirt was up over her breasts and he reached around her, cupping them and squeezing her nipples, leaning forward again and kissing her neck. She pressed herself against him, pressing herself against the bulge that was forming in his jeans. He felt the wetness between her thighs start to get soaked.</p> <p>"What are you thinking?" He said.
