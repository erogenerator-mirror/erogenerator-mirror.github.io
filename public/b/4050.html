I was glad she could handle it when I was around her. I felt kind of bad about how she acted but I knew she was right. I was just too young and I was lucky to have her as my own mom. A moment later she came in the door and I could see she was crying. She was still shaking. For a moment I was glad she was my mom. She had said so herself when I was little.</p> <p>After our supper we sat on the couch together and she stroked my head as I cried.</p> <p>"I don't really know how I feel about what you did to me. It isn't that I wanted you to know about my past. I'm sorry it's taken so long for us to get back together," she said.</p> <p>"I'm here now mom. I'm not a burden you can't do anything about. I hope you'll want to know?"I said, hugging her to my side.</p> <p>I thought I heard mom say something. I didn't hear it but I could sense her emotions welling up inside. It was obvious she was in love with me and at that moment she was my mom.</p> <p>"You're always going to be my mom now," she said smiling.</p> <p>"I love you mom, you're my mother," I said.</p> <p>"It feels good for you to know how much I care about you," she said, hugging me tight.</p> <p>In one last moment of deep emotion she said, "I don't think I should do this but I want to try if I can," she said.</p> <p>"I wouldn't do anything that I didn't enjoy doing," I said, hugging her again. She sighed with relief.</p> <p>"All right, we'll call it a night and I will let you make up your mind about tonight. You know, mom, you're a very special woman. I feel like we are really going to get along," I said.</p> <p>We kissed again, a long, tender kiss that lingered for a few minutes.</p> <p>"That was a wonderful kiss, thank you," she said.</p> <p>"It still doesn't feel right to do this," I said.</p> <p>"It wouldn't have been the same without you, honey," she said.</p> <p>"It's not wrong to want you to do those things, it's just wrong." She was starting to cry again.</p> <p>"I know honey, do you still want me to do this," I asked?</p> <p>"I'll never forget that," she said.</p> <p>She leaned over and kissed my lips softly then said, "All right, here we go."</p> <p>"You sure you aren't mad about it mom?" I asked.</p> <p>She was smiling softly and replied, "Don't give me your doubts; I love youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
