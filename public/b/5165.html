The door opened a little when he saw her, and he opened his mouth to say something, but only had eyes that could stare. Then, she made an expression of surprise and took a step around his desk and stood at the door.</p> <p>She moved towards him almost as if she didn't notice he was in there, but he was too quick, closing the door behind her. She turned and leaned forward, then, so she wouldn't fall out of the seat, she put her face right up against his, and with one last tearful look, she kissed his mouth. Not so soon though: they were too late. He couldn't take his eyes off her: she looked good - and sexy too.</p> <p>She kissed him back, and her lips were just as soft and tender as he recalled: not the harshness that he had thought they'd have after lunch. She made out with him, the moment she broke the kiss.</p> <p>"Are we done?" she whispered after a time, still whispering the same word over and over from memory.</p> <p>"Definitely," he whispered back.</p> <p>"What are we?"</p> <p>"I'll show you,"</p> <p>She smiled, pulled back and looked at the clock: "I should have had the whole evening," she said, "I should have let you do me to death."</p> <p>"Do you have to be so quick?"</p> <p>"Maybe I should be the responsible one, since my lover is only after I let him do me," she said, "then I should be the responsible one."</p> <p>"That's an interesting way to address him," he said, "and I'm not sure you should be the responsible one."</p> <p>"Why not?" she sniggered, "he does seem like a total gentleman."</p> <p>She had pulled out the panties and had started to lift them up.</p> <p>"My, you're a naughty girl," he said, "You shouldn't be wearing panties under them."</p> <p>"I'll take back my underwear," she replied, "or..."</p> <p>"Or what?"</p> <p>She stopped when he turned her around. Looking deep into those big blue eyes, he told her, "Or you can get the panties out."</p> <p>"Why not? Not only is I going to have to come and see to do it myself, but I'll have to go through the whole day in lingerie if that's what you're planning."</p> <p>"I'm all for that, of course." He grabbed the panties off the floor and handed them to her. She went on.</p> <p>"Come on," she said, moving on to her bed, "Show me what else I should have worn for our first date."</p> <p>She dropped the satin negligee on the floor, turned away from him, and bent over, one hand clutching the garter belt and the other, one hand stroking the top of her thigh in the front; and with both hands, slowly, very slowly turned to face him and reached down to pull first one, then another, until each was at the level of her crotch. Slowly, a few inches further, a little more, her breathing got heavier, then she pushed her panties aside, her fingers still moving a little as she felt the panties around the garter on the backs of her hands.</p> <p>"I want you," she whispered to him, "not just to just touch, though, but to get into position for you. And you'd better be quick."</p> <p>"Why not?"</p> <p>"Because you are the one doing this," she said, and opened the blouse with one hand – and her bra with the other. His eyes widened – she had got off the bed? – when he started to look and say "you're taking off your bra."</p> <p>"I think I might," she said, "but then I might not."</p> <p>"Then what?" he asked.</p> <p>"Then we're going to have to go to my office and get her bra and put it on."</p> <p>The question was so sudden and so unexpected that he froze up, then said, "I'm not in the mood for that," and ran into her bathroom. "Come on!" she said. He just followed her as she walked over to the doorway and into the kitchen.</p> <p>She had opened and she took back all of the clothes on her bed: it was time to go. She told him to get up on the bed, which he did gladly. With one hand, she took her panties off, pulled them on and tied a loop under her, then turned on the light, and took his arms, her legs and finally the blindfold off and tossed it away, again with one hand on the bed. She had his hands spread, then tied them there.
