She said smugly.</p> <p>At the office she was working on the next day. She did not know how to answer the question at the question. She had no idea how to act at the question though.</p> <p>Celeste was glad I was not her husband, so she decided to call it a night.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>It was the next day before I could get to the office.</p> <p>"Hi, I'm Pete. Your daughter told me you wanted to talk with me again." I had come upstairs for my coffee.</p> <p>I sat down at the computer and booted it up. I took two minutes to get ready for some coffee.</p> <p>"I guess we were talking about this week. Is it true you were in a relationship for the last 3 days."</p> <p>"U-huh." I started typing.</p> <p>The computer went silent once more. I didn't have a reply to that. The computer started up again.</p> <p>"I didn't see you there before now." I turned the screen back to her. "Were you working today?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm up late. The kids are in the front yard. I was going to give them some time to cool off. Is this important to you?</p> <p>"Yes, that's exactly." I responded and typed to me. "You are right. Why didn't you come home, right?"</p> <p>"You had breakfast with your daughter today?" I typed. "You couldn't get out of the car on the way home. You've had a few cups of coffee. How was your meeting?"</p> <p>"Fine, I was supposed to meet my parents in town for dinner this morning." "Good."</p> <p>"I think they are going to be mad at me." I typed. "I can't get out of it. I have a little breakfast. I will probably only work an hour today. I think it's a little too early to be going out tonight. My mother was going to call tonight and I'll be there by two," I typed.</p> <p>She had made the point that I should be with my daughter that evening. I logged off on the computer and started my work.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>My morning got a little better. I found that I was getting more sleep than I had in a while. I was having the worst time. I got up at two and left my house, walking back toward my house, about five minutes from home. I checked the house again as I walked down the street. The house was empty. There was just the two bedroom window that I was in. I thought about leaving the window open when I reached down for a piece of paper with my number. I was going into town and going to see a nice restaurant. I figured I would head home, I decided to go home, take a shower, drink another cup of coffee, and leave. And maybe I wouldn't go back to my parent's after all. I got home and was in bed when I got back to my computer. I checked the email again. Was there a message in here from Ms Reynolds? I did not see any return address on there. Was that from Ms Reynolds?</p> <p>I went to the bathroom, took a shower, and then I hit send. I was still thinking about what happened to Ms Reynolds. I went back to the email again. I decided to check it out. I was not surprised to read that Ms Reynolds is a divorce attorney. There was no question of the fact it is an attorney, but the fact that Ms Reynolds is the mother of one of my kids? That made for a interesting afternoon. I closed my laptop as I left my house around two o'clock.</p> <p>I was walking down the highway toward my house. I had decided that was a good idea after all.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>On Friday I had a meeting with a client.</p> <p>"Ms Reynolds, we are closing tonight. Are you free to see a movie tonight or a movie later?"</p> <p>"I will see a fine dinner with your recommendation. You are free too."</p> <p>"Great. I have an extra ticket. There's a movie on the way."</p> <p>"A movie?"</p> <p>"That's right. I wanted to see a classic film."</p> <p>"A movie?"</p> <p>"Yes. Something you've been waiting for. What time are you going to be home then?"</p> <p>"I don't know, probably six o'clock."</p> <p>"Perfect. I'll pick you up about eight." He wrote. I opened the door and walked up to the front door. I rang the door bell and walked inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
