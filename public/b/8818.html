I wanted to get all the things I need done today for some work."</p> <p>He glanced at his watch again, "I guess you have some time."</p> <p>"I'm on my way out, I'll see you tomorrow then."</p> <p>"Night Sis, see you at work."</p> <p>With a deep breath, Jamie stood up and walked into her room, where she had brought back her vibrator.</p> <p>When she stepped through her door, she looked at her roommate, "Oh I'm so excited, I'm so nervous!"</p> <p>Sophia could see that Jamie was nervous. Her roommate was the object of countless sexual fantasies many years ago, but never tried to join in. She wondered if it was because she was getting older, or had gotten tired, but then again, Jamie probably had.</p> <p>After Jamie left for work, Sophia took a deep breath, and pulled off her shirt, and pulled down her panties. She stood up and walked towards the bathroom, to her roommate.</p> <p>Once there, she removed the showerhead, and stepped inside.</p> <p>Sophia gasped as she saw Jamie standing under the water, a vibrator lying on the tile, in the dark of the bathroom. Her hands slid down her sides and under her sports bra, which was wet with the water. She removed her wet sports bra, and laid the towel on the shower bench, then stepped into the shower with it.</p> <p>Jamie pulled her close and kissed her deeply, and Sophia could actually smell the alcohol on Jamie's breath. That turned her on, and she could feel her own juices beginning to work their way down her leg.</p> <p>Breaking the kiss, Jamie pulled her friend into her bedroom by the hand, and pushed her on to the side of her bed.</p> <p>Sophia watched in amazement as she removed her own bra, and slid her panties down her stockinged legs. Jamie turned her around so that her back was against the foot of the bed.</p> <p>Jamie ran her nails up and down Sophia's thigh.</p> <p>"Oh god!"</p> <p>Jamie didn't stop.</p> <p>"That's so sexy!"</p> <p>When Jamie's fingertips touched her pussy lips, Sophia couldn't help but reach out and run her fingers through Jamie's hair, and the length of her boyfriend's cock. It felt too good to stop touching herself right there. The thought that she could now touch Jamie's boyfriend was exciting and very naughty at the same time.</p> <p>"Jamie."</p> <p>Jamie looked up at her, waiting for her.</p> <p>Jamie leaned down and kissed her lips. "Kneel."</p> <p>Sophia got off her bed, and stood beside it, waiting for Jamie's command.</p> <p>Jamie pulled her body close to hers. Both were breathing hard, "Are you still there?"</p> <p>Sophia nodded, "Yes, yes I'm still here."</p> <p>Jamie's eyes looked a little dazed, "I'm sorry Baby. What time is it?"</p> <p>"Almost nine o clock," she said softly, "would you mind getting ready and get your stuff? We will make sure you are all packed later so we can get to work."</p> <p>"I'll be there in a minute. How long will you be?"</p> <p>"I'll see you at nine then."</p> <p>Jamie quickly got her clothes into place, then turned and left the other room.</p> <p>Sophia stood there until the front door closed. A few seconds later she was on the phone with her boss, saying goodbye to her boss, and the house. She was surprised that he was still at work. It was still early and even though the house was dark she could still feel Jamie's hands over her body. She was sure their bodies touched everywhere, although it was difficult to explain, even with Jamie's fingers inside her. She was completely lost in the moment when she saw Jamie's car pull into the parking lot.</p> <p>She looked at her clock as she finished her call, eleven fifteen. It would be only a few minutes longer, she thought to herself. This was all new to her, but right now it felt so good.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Jamie had her brother come home early, and they were going to take a shower. While the room was hot, it would take no time to dry themselves off, and Jamie's brother came home shortly after. Jamie had just finished drying her hair, and it felt good to dry it herself. She pulled the towel over her shoulders and began to do so when she heard someone enter the bathroom.
