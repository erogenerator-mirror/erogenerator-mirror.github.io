"I don't wanna get a bad grade in this class."</p> <p>"No, don't worry," Mrs. O'Leary said.</p> <p>"Come sit in my lap, Mom, I'm feeling a bit funny," MaryAnn said, as she sat down into Maryann's lap.</p> <p>"Oh, okay, Mom, I'm feeling better now. My dad died last night," MaryAnn said. "I'm sorry to hear about your father."</p> <p>MaryAnn could feel her tears falling on top of her shirt. She knew that she loved her mother more than anything in the world and she knew that she wasn't going to be able to bear the pain of losing her father. MaryAnn wanted to tell her husband about the past, but she couldn't say it with her nose stinging. MaryAnn decided to let her do everything for her because she was afraid that the pain would get to her.</p> <p>MaryAnn lifted both of her hands and brushed away the tears that were falling from her eyes. "Mom, you can have the abortion if you do it with my consent. However, I'm married now so I don't have to worry. The abortion was the only way to stop me from going back to the way we were. I'm sure you understood that."</p> <p>MaryAnn took a quick glance at Bill. "You said you weren't going to have another baby and you couldn't possibly have another man's baby," MaryAnn said.</p> <p>"I didn't say I was a whore," Bill said without any conviction in his voice. "I did say that there would probably be complications to having a child. I'd have to say there has never been any complications. But you shouldn't worry because I'm the only one who has ever had a child."</p> <p>"How is that possible," MaryAnn asked. "I thought that it was only your sperm that you would be able to produce. I didn't feel any different," MaryAnn said.</p> <p>"What else could be different?" Bill asked.</p> <p>"Well, just like the baby you're carrying that is probably as big as your father's," MaryAnn said, with a smirk.</p> <p>MaryAnn picked up her coffee cup and brought it towards Bill. "How long will you wait for your sperm to be gone? If my blood is not still fresh, I may have trouble getting pregnant. If you haven't given birth yet, it will probably work out better so I don't have to worry about it."</p> <p>Bill looked at MaryAnn's hand for a long moment. Then he lifted his arm to touch her cheek. "This feels different," he said. "I'll think about it."</p> <p>MaryAnn thought about it for a second. "Yeah, I'll think about it about it," She replied. "But I'd like to hear from you," MaryAnn said. She pulled the skirt of her skirt up a bit to give Bill better access to her leg.</p> <p>"I won't forget if it isn't for your troubles. You'll probably want to talk to me about this," Bill said with a smile.</p> <p>MaryAnn was smiling too. "I've been thinking about this all morning," MaryAnn said. "I am a real pro at it. I've been on the pill for nearly five years as of now."</p> <p>Bill was still standing up and Bill's face was still bright red from the embarrassment that had crossed his mind at MaryAnn's touch. "I don't really need to talk about being a pro," Bill said. "I'm not as old as you're thinking. I'll talk to you about it when I get a chance, okay?"</p> <p>"Okay," MaryAnn said. She then sat down in Maryann's lap again. MaryAnn kissed her tenderly on the mouth. "It's okay, Baby," she said.</p> <p>MaryAnn pulled the skirt of Bill's shirt back down and kissed the side of his face every so often. "I'm a pro." She said.</p> <p>MaryAnn hugged Bill as she whispered in his ear. "But we will have time to talk before we have sex, okay?"</p> <p>Bill looked up at his mom as he replied. "Okay," Bill said as he turned around and sat down again.</p> <p>"Okay, Mom. I won't be able to stay on the pill forever," Bill said. "But I think that I can make a few more babies before I pass them on to mom," He said. "If I get the chance, maybe I'll start now."</p> <p>MaryAnn felt a shiver of excitement runâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
