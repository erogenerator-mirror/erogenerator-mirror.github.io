Finally, she rolled us over so she was on top. The next thing I knew, her pussy was pressing against mine. I'm not sure whether she was making us cum or if the thought was making us cum. Either way, it was an incredibly erotic moment. As she slowly rocked back and forth on me, I could feel the head of my cock rubbing her G-spot. A minute later, she was moaning, "ohhh, ooooooh, I'm cummmmmminnnng." I felt the first wave of her orgasm hit her. Her legs clamped down on my ribs, her arms went around my neck, and she just laid there. The sensations built again, slowly, slowly. When she started to get tired, I raised her, rolled her over on top of me, and gave her a long, slow tongue-fuck. We lay together for a minute, just soaking in the moment.</p> <p>"I can't believe I just did that," she said quietly. "That was so incredible."</p> <p>"We'll have to do it again someday," I grinned. "But not now." She smiled, and she rolled away to rest on her back. I stayed between her legs, kissed them in turn, then rolled on top of her. We kissed, lightly caressed each other, feeling and fondling. We spent a minute kissing each other's mouth, necks, ears, then we did it again, making out. We kissed some more, then I slowly pulled back, kissed her neck, her collarbone, her chin, then her mouth once again. When I lowered my head to hers, she opened her mouth and we kissed and I pulled my face away from hers briefly.</p> <p>"Oh shit," she said. "That was fantastic."</p> <p>For a minute or so, neither of us moved or said anything.</p> <p>"Would you be OK with it if I let you take me a condom?" she asked, almost as a question.</p> <p>I was tempted to agree. The thought scared the hell out of me and I'd never given myself to anyone else, much less a girl. It seemed to break something inside of me. But I thought I could trust her.</p> <p>And then, "oh, yeah, you can use a condom, you know, you just have to know."</p> <p>She turned her head and looked at me for a minute as if I had just decided what to do with the situation. But she smiled and her eyes said, "I'm all yours. That was awesome."</p> <p>I didn't have long to dwell on this. When I rolled the condom toward her, she reached for it. I looked in a couple of different directions, as the condom was about mid-thigh length.</p> <p>"Let's do this without the condom on," she said, and she pulled the rubber off. I watched it disappear behind my back, as she got up on her knees and lay on her back. As she did, I pulled at the top of the rubber and it slipped off while I was still on my back.</p> <p>She spread her legs and pointed them out and said, "here, get some lube." I got some, and she rubbed some on my cock and on her pussy. I slid down between her legs, and I felt that incredible feeling of the slick slippery feeling against my cock. Not only was it so wonderful to fuck, it was the most wonderful feeling in the world, because I was able to go deeper.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, that's wonderful," she said, and we both moaned as I slowly fucked her. She reached for me and I knew what she wanted. She lay on her back and directed my cock to her vagina. I pressed my cock against her and felt the heat, as it spread through the condom and started to roll off.</p> <p>"Just relax, I'm not going to hurt you," she said. "Let me give you a bit of a boost."</p> <p>I pushed myself down, and I felt my cock slowly expand just a bit. Then, with a few quick thrusts, I was buried in her pussy. We lay there, just taking in the moment, not really speaking. I just enjoyed the feeling of our hot and slick bodies feeling the other, just letting time move backwards and forwards before we could really talk. When I moved in closer, the condom began to roll off her lower half, so I grabbed the top of it and rolled it back to her upper half. Then, I pulled back the condom, rolled it down, and put the top back on.</p> <p>Once we got our breathing under control, we said something for the first time, and then I just started moving in and out. It was very intense, both emotionally and physically. We got closer andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
