"Turn over."</p> <p>Mika got back to her stomach and bent down, turning and presenting her ass for him to take. "Here I go again," he declared. "Oh, it's tight enough," she laughed. "Let's try something else." She turned over quickly and he grabbed her around the waist and held her until she could move. Once her legs fell, he had her hold her position, and then lowered her so that she was sitting with her legs up, and he reached down and spread her legs wide.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, you're good," he said gently, then he put his finger to his mouth and licked it. "I want to try something new now."</p> <p>"Okay," she said, trying to relax. "I thought about that from the moment you got here."</p> <p>He got up on his knees and looked down at her, and for a moment he was afraid he'd hurt her, but it was probably nothing more than a simple mistake. He went down the right path, taking her wetness in his mouth without any effort. He brought his hand to her sex, lightly rubbing her clit. "You like this?" he asked and she nodded. "I want you to make me come like you did before," he added, and she nodded again. But he wanted to make sure, and he rubbed her clit softly while his tongue moved in and out and around. She felt him slip his fingers into her, which made her shudder.</p> <p>Suddenly, the door opened and the two men came in, and they stared at them, as if they'd heard a different story.</p> <p>Mika felt hands on her. Hands on her thighs, and then she felt a cock press against her and enter.</p> <p>"Mmmm," she whispered, leaning forward as she felt his hands on her chest.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, baby," he breathed, then his hands slid down her arms and he lifted her, then dropped back down onto her, pulling her down onto his cock. She cried out and moaned, and felt hands on her other leg at the same time.</p> <p>For several minutes she was totally overwhelmed by the sensations and sensations of having her sex eaten while she was bent over the bed in the middle of the room. The sensations weren't going to last long, as a few minutes further on and she started to feel the crescendo of intense pleasure begin to build deep within her. Her legs were shaking. Her breath was coming in little pants from her mouth as the sensations were getting harder and more intense. He wasn't even the fucking kind of guy. His mouth, his mouth, was driving her wild as he was fucking her, and she could feel his cock deep within her, driving deeper and deeper. It was all too much, and she felt a strong, powerful orgasm start to build. Her body tingled as it reached its peak. She felt his entire body tensing as his cock spasmed, and she heard the sound of his release, his hot cum flooding her insides. He kept his tongue in her to the hilt and kept her coming until she was done.</p> <p>Finally, he lifted himself off of her. "Okay, that was incredible," Mika said. "You are one hell of a friend."</p> <p>He turned her over on her stomach, then kissed the back of her neck, pushing her towards the bathroom.</p> <p>"I can't believe what I just did!" Mika said between sated but increasingly sore legs. She felt the dampness of her own pussy, but didn't know what had happened. She was sure they'd had something to do with it, but who knew?</p> <p>"I think there was a little 'extra' here, I guess," she smiled. "I just wish I'd thought of something more permanent."</p> <p>"I'm glad you enjoyed it," He said, leaning over her and giving her a kiss. "I can't see any reason to think that we wouldn't enjoy each other more."</p> <p>Mika was a little confused. It was all so sudden after so many weeks? Then there was no reason for it and nothing would make sense. "What do you mean? I don't think... I don't know, we don't."</p> <p>He just grinned. "I think we like each other a lot," he said as he ran his fingers up, down, and over her stomach. "And I think that sex makes us both hornier and more free,"</p> <p>"I'm flattered," Mika said, leaning back against the door. "I was just surprised how much of a sex freak I amâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
