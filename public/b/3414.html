I'm really not into guys, but I'll try to say that once I'm on the train. I'll get up on time, and I'll let you suck my cock; you can do it yourself for all I care."</p> <p>I'm not sure that I'm comfortable with men talking to me like this, but I think they are right. I look back at myself in the mirror and notice that the top half of my face is a deep brown that's covered by my hair and I can't believe how much makeup and mascara I'm wearing. I still have a big, silly smile, but it's not that. It's nice to be sexy, if you ask me.</p> <p>"It's cute. That just comes naturally."</p> <p>"Thank you, I think." I stand up, my legs kicking. I start to walk off, "I'll see you later."</p> <p>"Okay." I turn and walk out of the salon, leaving my eyes locked on the mirror as I walk down the street with my skirt raised. I'm hoping maybe I can find a guy to ask me out.</p> <p>When I get home, I decide not to do anything but wait in anticipation for Jake to leave.</p> <p>Later that night, I wonder about Jake. I guess now is my opportunity. I'm hoping he will be nice to me, and then maybe we can have the conversation again. I'm wondering what I can do to convince him. I also can't help the fact that I'm a little excited about going back to school for my new history. My heart keeps racing, hoping he would make the offer.</p> <p>I wonder if he's going to even try, because he might be interested in seeing me, if he knows how to do all my makeup. I want to find out just how special he is in bed, and if he would suck me off before the night is over. I figure that if he just lets me suck his cock on his way to fucking me in the shower, it would be worth the extra cost.</p> <p>I walk to the bedroom and am shocked, for a moment I see him laying on the bed, and am instantly excited. What was happening? I strip and get into bed with Jake; I lean up against him and wrap my arms around him and squeeze my legs around him. He is so warm, and he smells so hot, I can't believe he's gotten so hard.</p> <p>I roll over and put my arms around him, he pulls me tight as I wrap my legs down around him and I feel his cock poking me in my pelvic and I realize what I've been doing, because he's got a hand up my blouse; he's rubbing my breasts through my bra. I'm shocked. I'm supposed to find out how big they are - if I let him - when we get home, what will I wear?</p> <p>He doesn't seem to care; he's getting in the mood; he rolls me off of him and gets on top of me. I wrap my legs around him, and he pulls up my skirt, and I think 'Damn, Jake's got a cock. Why did I take off my panties, just to get that idea'.</p> <p>"Mm...", I whisper. He kisses me and I can taste myself on him. He breaks our kiss and continues, "Let me see." I start to protest but I can't, or won't, say anything. He kisses down my neck, his teeth lightly grazing my skin. Suddenly he bites down hard, and I gasp, as I know it will hurt. He continues down my belly, leaving small red marks, and then he starts to lick my clit.</p> <p>"Ooh god...", I yell out. I'm so turned-on, I want it, I need it. He runs his tongue all the way down to my clit and I'm so close, I can't hold back any longer. I'm so turned-on, I can't believe I'm making me feel like this. I don't care if I get pregnant, it'd only be in my head. I start to grind my hips, and then I feel as if my life is going to change, as if I'll just lose my memory. Suddenly he stops, and I gasp at the suddenness. I'm scared, I'm worried he'll hurt me, and I want to do nothing but cum.</p> <p>"Baby," I say, and I don't just refer to him as a baby. I just say, "My name is Lacey, Lacey Johnson."</p> <p>"My name's Jake. Yes, it's Lacey, Lacey." I put my hands in his hair, and we settle into a deep kiss, our mouths locked, our kisses deep. I'm trying to fight the need to say things that I shouldn't, but we're in this body in no particular order.
