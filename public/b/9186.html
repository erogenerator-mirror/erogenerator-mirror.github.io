Taking her hand, he held it as they made their way to join them at the shallow end of the tub. She sat on his lap, pressing him to her chest and began to kiss her neck. He held her tightly so that they weren't so close and slid one hand down to her pussy, his finger sliding down into her slit, and her hips bucked up against him, and she whimpered and said, "Not yet, I want this big cock!"</p> <p>He pressed her back to the tub, and lifting her leg over to sit in the shallow end, his cock was right at her entrance.

She pushed down hard on his cock and cried out as she came for him, and as he groaned, she knew he was about to explode.</p> <p>As his dick throbbed and spurted into her, her body seized up in a powerful, blissful and intense orgasm. Her breath came in pants at first, and then her body went limp. He held her and kissed her and stroked her body as she came, her hand running through his hair and down his back. She felt her body go limp, and as she lay there, he slid his arms under her back to support her, one hand gently cupping her breast as the other stroked her slit still leaking with her juices. As they laid beside each other, he slid the fingers over her lips, and she sighed.</p> <p>Her hands found his face, and they kissed deeply and tenderly, each of their bodies sated in the embrace of the hot tubâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
