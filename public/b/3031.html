"We would get a lot more people to come to the club, but not with the risk of being judged, so we'd need to do something a little more risky. But I thought we could go to one of The Society's private clubs, where they would have a lot of open-aired sex parties. It would be fun, though." He got a wicked grin on his face as he said it, but I couldn't tell who it was, and didn't care who I could tell.</p> <p>"Let's go!" we said, jumping up the stairs.</p> <p>We walked to the last floor of the building, and I led the way. Once at the end of the corridor, I could feel the sexual tension in the room, which had increased since we arrived. We entered the club, where people were already chatting and chatting, drinking and dancing. But a lot of people were watching the dancers, with a couple more drinking and smoking, so we soon got sidled up to a room reserved for only couples, which was filled with sex. It was almost a hundred feet below the floor of the club, the lights were on all night, and a full length mirror over the wall covered by a heavy curtain.</p> <p>Dancing and drinking, too! I didn't say a word, I just undid my blouse, dropped it on a table and sat on the side of the room, to watch the girls.</p> <p>"Shit!" I said to myself. I'd had too much to drink already, and I was feeling no pain after having a few drinks and going to the club with my new friend. I wanted to strip and have sex, in a deserted warehouse. I'm not that big of a sex-hungry woman, but I thought I could get away with flashing a couple dozen guys and women, in a room packed with sex stars. "Come on!" I told myself, as I watched the guys who were standing around watching me undress. I didn't care what was going on, and I was too curious about what it would be like to do it. I was getting more and more turned on to see every guy who saw me undress watching me. It was turning me on even more, and with the alcohol and sex already happening, my pussy would have been very wet if that hadn't made me feel that way.</p> <p>I got up from the table, and walked up to the mirror. I could still see my body through the narrow window, and I let the dress fall to the ground. My legs were shapely, and looked like they would look great naked, because they would be. I stood up from the table, and looked around the room, at all the clothes I was wearing. I felt horny, all over again. I could feel my cunt getting wet at the thought of flashing a few guys and women all night. I didn't care how horny they would be, what others might think, what they would do. I was already feeling sexually excited, so I took off my clothes in less than a minute.</p> <p>I stepped inside the room, through the thin strip curtain, and into one of the room's mirrored walls. I took off my bra, revealing small but perky breasts and erect nipples. I pushed my chest out, and I wanted each movement I made, to turn the air on my erect nipples and cunt, but at the same time I had just wanted to flash some strangers. I liked the fact that I was being seen topless by all these gorgeous men and women, just taking off my clothes for them. After all, it would be only fair on some couples, too. "Hey, what if I put a little too much on? It'll make a good show," I said aloud. "How about you?"</p> <p>I saw the man walking into the room. At that moment he was dressed but wearing pants, which went to the knees. His face showed how much he was turned on by his own naked body. He turned slowly so he could look at my naked body, and even turned some shades in the corners so he could look at me while he did it.</p> <p>"Come on," I said, smiling. "I'll be back with a nice new outfit for you tonight." I gave him a good show of my nipples and my dripping cunt by just the sheer, transparent material of my thong, which had a big wet patch on the front.</p> <p>I went to the man as he turned to leave, leaving the curtains a way open. I stepped inside, and felt my nipples getting hard. "Oh yes," I whispered. "I'll be back in a minute."</p> <p>I went up to the curtain, and undid the front of it, letting the cloth drop down to my waist. I heard the man walk into the room, a grin on his face. He saw me, and immediately felt theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
