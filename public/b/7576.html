He was a very special man. With that thought I suddenly felt really happy. I'm so lucky that I am not going to be jealous again about other men but if I'm able to have sex with someone every day I will have the opportunity to practice some with anyone who wants. There will be times when I will do things that I shouldn't because they would cause damage and I don't want to make it impossible. But I will always trust the one person I can depend on to be able to love me if I ask them to and he'll always be there. I'm so lucky. Then my thoughts turned to our future together. It's a mess and what would it be if everything went so badly.</p> <p>As soon as we arrive on the road we head for the school district. I don't see where I have to ask his mom but he and I can't keep secrets from either of them. We go to the same school I do now and then. My parents live about an hour away and his mom lives about twenty minutes away. He loves it here as well and I love it with my life. It's been so long since we spent some quality time together.</p> <p>We arrive at our destination and park in front of my parents' home. We both stand there for a moment looking at our surroundings. I always wonder about our future but with our history, I think it will be pretty easy for us at least. I'm really happy there now. We go inside and I feel like I'm really happy. My eyes just water up for the first time in years. I have to find out everything about him. My brother. I should just leave and never mention him again.</p> <p>I hear my door open and know we're home by the sounds and smells coming from the kitchen. I rush into the bathroom and look at myself in the mirror. It all seems so strange but not really bad at all. I take a lot of effort and remember what happened with his dad at prom and I start to feel better. It's a good feeling and helps me take the edge off. Then I look at my naked body again and I smile. I must look pretty good as I'm not in my old age. It's not like I was out of shape or anything and looking good was only helping keep me alive. My nipples are hard and poking through the thin cotton of my tank. I want my body to look sexy but not show off everything. It's so hard to do and my chest still looks like it would be too tight. I'm happy that it feels like they're still so firm and firm. But it's different, it's even better. I look in the mirror and I see all my muscles. My tits are bigger than most of the girls I've been with and I can't believe it I'm still seeing them so good. I look at them now and I'm excited about what I see. They have gotten bigger since the last dance. They feel good inside and I feel a bit insecure around them like they really are my body. I look down into my lap and my cock has gotten a bit hard. It starts to throb and looks pretty good on me. It's a nice, hard cock and I look at how it looks through my shorts.</p> <p>I grab my phone and look at the pictures I have taken of myself. I can't believe I haven't got even one of me but I have. I know why his mom and dad have gone out on dates but I just love the way they're all dressed up in different outfits and with a different music. I've gotten used to looking at myself in different poses. I can still do it, even when I'm nervous. I love looking at myself like that and being sexy is the best. I look at the pictures and I feel bad about my lack of confidence. It's a whole other ball of emotions but it's only been for a week now and I want to look and touch them. It just makes me happy to have something that makes me feel good. I look at the pictures I am just seeing how much they do make me feel good. I really wish I had a camera. I want to show off for my man and show off my body. This is so crazy but I can't help it. I want nothing but to be sexy, to feel sexy and to look at myself. I can't believe I could be this nervous because I'm looking and looking.</p> <p>I walk over to him and let him sit down on his bed. I sit by him with my hand on my knee. After a long moment he moves over closer and puts his head on top of my knee. I give a sigh of relief. He kisses my knee softly.</p> <p>"So what did you plan to do tonight when you got home?"</p> <p>"That was actually what I was planning. Do you still rememberâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
