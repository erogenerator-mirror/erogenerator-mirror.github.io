They had been kissing for several days and she was really starting to lose that battle. Her resistance melted away as he continued to press himself against her until finally she surrendered to their urgent desires. She could feel his erection against her as the heat of his body warmed hers. He began to slide himself inside her, teasing her with some slow and torturous movements, making her moan and press herself to him, begging him for more.</p> <p>She knew this was only the beginning for them. They hadn't ever been this intimate before, but she wanted more. She wanted to feel him in her when they finally made love.</p> <p>He stopped himself from pulling himself into her tight passage. "Let's get those clothes off," he said. "Let's do it in bed. You're so hot."</p> <p>"That's fine," she said. "I'm flat as an egg."</p> <p>"Then I won't think about you," he added. "And that'll be true even if it means we're cheating on you."</p> <p>"Don't worry," she promised. "I want more."</p> <p>The next day at work was a whirlwind of meetings and meetings. She hated all the interruptions, but he insisted that she should keep her work time free.</p> <p>She went out to lunch and he made her lunch and ate her lunch with him. They finished lunch and the meeting was over in an hour and a half to be exact. He led her to his office.</p> <p>He pulled her into his arms. "I got a proposition," he said. "We're going to meet the rest of the way in the bedroom."</p> <p>"Please," she said. "We don't have time. I want it tonight."</p> <p>He smiled and kissed her roughly on the lips, pushing his tongue inside her mouth to sample hers and his hands found their way in the back of her shirt to grope at her braless breasts and tug at her nipples. She tried to kiss back, but he'd gotten a hold of her head and pulled her back. "This is so wrong," she whispered against his lips.</p> <p>He just smiled. "It's just a call," he said. He'd got her attention. In all the months they'd been on this little adventure she hadn't noticed.</p> <p>She was about to protest when he lifted her chin and kissed her again. This time their mouths were locked in a hungry kiss and his hand slid down her arm to grasp something hard and strong and slippery. He lifted it up to find her nipple.</p> <p>"Don't worry. We've got time." Then his lips slid across her cheek and down her neck, where he nibbled at her skin.</p> <p>She was shocked by his move, but not surprised by it. Her body reacted to all of this and she couldn't help a groan. He pushed the rubber cock into her. It fit, but just didn't match his cock. Even with it in place it felt bigger than it ever was. She'd been with so many toys that it hurt to try and fit one in even though it was very pleasurable.</p> <p>But she was used to it and now he wanted to try it with her. "This," she said, but was interrupted by his lips on hers. "This is too much." She felt his hands on her hips as he pulled her against him, grinding her back against his erection.</p> <p>She was sure she could feel his hardness press against her body against her own body and he pushed his hips against her as his arms pulled her against him. She felt herself getting hotter, tighter and began to grind against him even when he pulled her hair and pulled her head and the sides of her neck with the back of his hand.</p> <p>"Don't take this wrong," he said. "You're just being a little slut."</p> <p>She just looked at him and he could see her arousal written all over her face, but she couldn't make herself do what he had suggested. She wanted to be the slut that night, but she felt she couldn't find the courage to speak.</p> <p>His hand slid under the short skirt up her arm to the back of it and she felt him rub her panties. She felt his fingers slide over the hem of her skirt. He pushed one finger inside her and she felt her body give in. She was wet for him. She felt as though she could feel herself as his fingers slid inside her. One hand was still on her neck and he had the other hand sliding from the zipper of her skirt to her hips. Her skirt was getting pushed up.
