"Now that we know we can't get a lawyer now, I think I'd like to give you a quick little explanation. Why are you here? Are you... a virgin?"</p> <p>She nodded. I'm told. "Okay," she said. "Well, I'm no virgin. I mean, we're only going to be lovers. But to be honest, as long as we're all consenting adults, I don't think we need to do it again. In fact, I didn't realize that first night in the bar until we came out here. It was just a bit like the night you and I..."</p> <p>I smiled. How did she hear me? "Okay, I've heard many times. I'm guessing that you're a virgin."</p> <p>The look on her face was indescribable (and she was grinning wickedly at me). "Mmmhhhmmmmmm," she murmured as she leaned back on the bed. The look on her face was the expression of rapture. I stared into her eyes... and I had no inhibitions. My heart was racing and my loins were tingling....</p> <p>"Oh, I am such a lucky dog!" I quipped as I stepped towards her... and planted a quick kiss on her lips. "I've been dreaming of this day for ages now! I guess this is your fault that I'm not going to ruin our night..."</p> <p>She smiled and opened her mouth wide for me to suck on mine...</p> <p>I kissed her hungrily, my hands sliding up and down her body, teasing her nipples to hardness, which had become quite hard under her blouse... "You'd know that after just a few days," she purred. "I had a lot to confess and... well... I'm sorry for keeping you waiting for so long...."</p> <p>I nodded in agreement. She turned on her side, facing away from me, her legs parted and her knees drawn up. I placed an ankle on each shoulder and pulled her down onto my lap, my erection pointing directly at her pouting pussy, which I spread with my hands as she lay back. She lay there with her thighs wide open, her legs straight, toes pointing to the ceiling... and her eyes closed in anticipation...</p> <p>"Please?" she asked softly, her lips moving back to meet mine. "Please what? Willing to have sex, while you do this?"</p> <p>"Oh yes," I agreed, pressing her knees apart and sliding my erection against her pussy lips. "But now I want you to make me... cum!"</p> <p>She laughed, reaching down to caress my shaft with her sex. "I guess you're going to have to finish me first!"</p> <p>I pressed into her, sliding deeper and deeper into her, pressing the head of my penis into her core, which had already begun to clench and throb. My whole body thrashed above hers... and we moaned together, our mouths meeting eagerly, our tongues caressing.</p> <p>I held her and I took her into the bedroom, as we fell to the bed where we had shared a lot more that we could ever have imagined or dreamed about. Her arms surrounded me, her hands caressed my body and her legs around mine began undulating against mine and pulling me closer to her...</p> <p>We fucked each other slowly and gently, knowing that if we kept at it until we both came, we'd both get an orgasm out of it before we had to leave. We'd need every available moment to recover together. "Oh, God," she whimpered, "I can't think of anything nicer than that!"</p> <p>I pressed against her again and she raised her face to mine and our lips met once more. Our tongues caressed each other as we drove deep into each other. Our bodies trembled and shook and we panted and groaned as our bodies met. We were so excited that neither of us realized we were about to simultaneously come...</p> <p>Then we heard it-- the unmistakable sound of the clack of sneakers on the tile floor. With a moan of pleasure, we simultaneously began to pull ourselves up, our bodies trembling together, our eyes closed, our mouths still locked in a passionate kiss. I grabbed her hand and we raced towards the bedroom, where we'd have the most explosive, sexiest, sexiest moment ever recorded in recorded history. I wanted to take her to paradise, I'd come to her there, and I'd never forget this night.</p> <p>We ended up in the bedroom, with her on top, with me laying back and her skirt up around her waist, my cock buried inside her, where the mattress hadn't gone. She lay perfectly still, her eyes closed, her body trembling in pleasure beneath me...</p> <p>I felt myself coming to life.
