She slid her hands up his torso and cupped his face and kissed him as she had before. Her tongue pushed into his mouth and he responded by trying to slip one of his hands under her bra.</p> <p>"No, just take it off," she said, pulling back to let him watch her. "We haven't decided yet."</p> <p>She pulled her hands away from his face and, lifting his head, slid the lace cups up to free his chest. "I'm sorry, but I need you to undo the clasp and open the front. It will be easier, don't you think?"</p> <p>Diana's eyes opened so wide he almost laughed. He leaned down and let his hands rest on her shoulders as she removed the clasp so fast that it looked like she was almost ripping it off. Her large breasts hung down onto his chest and he couldn't believe they were so perky that they were bouncing right there.</p> <p>"What do you think?" he asked, taking off the blouse again. "My God you're beautiful."</p> <p>He lifted his hands and ran his hands slowly up and down and when he got to her bra line he felt her tits as they moved up under his hands. Her nipples were standing out like big eraser heads with that lovely tawny color of flesh. He ran his hands along the underside of her breasts and slid them up and down a couple of times.</p> <p>"That feels good," she said. "But now I need to undo something." She pulled him down on top of her and guided him toward her breasts. "Do you like big titties in your hand?" she whispered.</p> <p>"Oh, yes. They are so soft. I love having my hands on them." He put one of his fingers on each nipple and rolled them between his fingers. "You're doing great," she cooed, "but do I still have permission to do whatever I want?"</p> <p>"Yes, but you have to do whatever makes me happy."</p> <p>She kissed him again and then pulled him to her and held him in place while rolling her tongue around his. She rolled over onto her back and pulled him over her as she lay there letting him slip down to kiss her breast and pull it up toward her waist. He lowered his face and began to take long strokes between her breasts which were huge and beautiful and she lifted her legs to meet each of his as he kissed them.</p> <p>"You really do like them. You might even like to suck on them." He watched as she pulled his head closer to her and then began to run her fingers through his hair. His cock had been almost fully hard when he came by the pool but was now growing and it wasn't long before it was getting thicker and longer.</p> <p>"Let's get you out of those clothes," she said as she pulled him toward the door.</p> <p>Diana was as naked as they were. Her big tits were hanging over the edge of the bed and her nipples were as hard as little pebbles as he looked. She lay back against the pillows and beckoned him with her hands. "OK baby, I get it. Let's get to it."</p> <p>He lay down on his back and Diana started taking his pants off. He lay completely naked with his hard cock waving in the air like a bobblehead in the late evening when she dropped to her knees and took him in her mouth. Her tongue was licking his cock as her head began to move up and down. Her fingers were sliding up his thighs toward his ass. When she found the crack they were both smiling when she slid his cock from her mouth and slid her body over toward his. "Spread your legs," she whispered, as one hand held his cock and the other guided it to her pussy. "Push it all the way into me and fuck me until I cum over and over again." She took his cock all the way up into herself and then back out until just the head was in her. He pulled his legs up close to her stomach and when she began to move up and down the rest of him, his thighs held hers and her pussy slid up and down on him as she did it. "Fuck me, sweetie. I'm going to teach you to love me."</p> <p>"Oh my God, Diane, that feels SO good. I love it so fucking much!" His head went back on the bed and he started to thrust his hips and go longer, thrusting deeper into her as her body responded to it. It would only be a few minutes before she made him cum in her and, watching her come with his cock wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
