"I want to do whatever you want to me that way," he added.</p> <p>We kissed again but this time it was with a bit more urgency. He took my hands and brought them behind him and over his buttocks and down the front of his body and back up again and over his chest and abdomen to rest on top of my breasts. We kissed deeply for a minute or two and I felt him growing hard on his own.</p> <p>He pulled back and looked down at me. "I could probably use some help," he said teasingly, "but I was enjoying this too much." With one hand he reached under the back of my skirt and slowly stroked my thighs, moving them a bit to expose me more as he went. I had my eyes closed and was breathing hard but still he continued and moved on his own. I moved my right leg out from under the skirt. I was really getting into the sensation and had no idea what to do.</p> <p>When I opened my eyes as the music paused to be replaced by the opening of another song, he pulled me up and pushed me to one of the tables. He had my skirt up around my waist and was slowly lifting it off. I helped him and it came off in a flourish. He took my hand and led me and the table to a bedroom door.</p> <p>"Do you know if you can get this door unlocked, please?" he asked me as he opened the door. It had a small hole in the center to let someone in but it had a hole on the outside, and we had another bedroom door as well. It was just up to the outside of the door, not the bedroom door.</p> <p>It was a huge room with a king size bed, which looked like someone was moving inside the room. Two sides curved the bed with its ceiling and a small counter with a stool and a couple of chairs. One side had a small dresser and was against the bed with a small wooden head. The second side was more like a closet but was about 20 feet away from us.</p> <p>We went inside and it was lit by a light that was almost out. There was a short hallway and a bathroom and a door that led off to the right of a door. It led to the bathroom and kitchen and just off the edge of the room was a set of stairs.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" He asked, "there's a bathroom over there where you could lock the door and go naked. You could use the bidet if you could."</p> <p>"I don't know," I said, looking around at the room. It was furnished and looked about the same size as this room. There were a couple of walk-in closets off near by with some cabinets there as well, I realized. That's where he had been at for about 30 minutes.</p> <p>"I think I have everything set up," I said as I started to put it together. Before long he pulled me over to him and we embraced. He unbuttoned my blouse and slipped it off me, followed by my bra. His hands moved to my bra and he began unhooking it and it came off easily.</p> <p>"Let's see how naked you really are," he said, and pulled my skirt off in front. The skirt came off next and as I stepped out of it I was standing naked in front of him.</p> <p>He was sitting naked on the edge of the bed. His legs were spread about three feet apart and he had his arms around me and we kissed again. I looked at the floor and wondered what had happened to the bed. A moment later, we moved on to it, and I could feel his weight on it, and I was still feeling his erection between us and his hands on my breasts. I was sopping wet now, but it was feeling good.</p> <p>"I can't wait to see what happens next," I said and we kissed deeply again. I felt him move his right leg, which was hanging over the end edge that was against the headboard. He had one leg on the bed and it came to rest between my legs. His head was on my breasts in his hands and his mouth was on my nipple. His right hand kept stroking my thighs and his left hand was squeezing my ass. It made me really excited and I could feel myself getting aroused.</p> <p>I felt him stand up and move to the side of the bed, and soon his hands were all over me, and they wandered all over my body. I wanted him to take me to the bed and fuck me, but he had otherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
