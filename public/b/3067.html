The thought of her boyfriend sucking her pussy wasn't that great; and knowing that it would just be their second one in a month made her even happier. Her smile broadened and she knew that she really enjoyed herself.</p> <p>Heidi watched his face as he sucked on her pink nub and she loved the way he licked her clitoris. It felt so good to have his mouth on her pussy and she reached forward and grasped handful of his hair.</p> <p>"Oh god, baby...it's been so long..."</p> <p>Heidi felt another pair coming. The first had a large amount of her cum on it as it dripped to his chin. He turned her towards him, bent and licked it away.</p> <p>"Mmmmm, you taste so good, honey. It's been so long."</p> <p>Heidi opened her eyes to look at him. His eyes were dark, brown and deep-set with long lashes that ran over his gorgeous face and looked like he was the epitome of a good kid. She was pretty sure that she looked good but she also realized that it was his eyes that were a bit of eye-sore.</p> <p>Heidi's gaze was locked with his. He watched her eyes as he took her hand and brought it to his mouth, savoring the feeling of touching her fingers in his mouth, just as he had done with her hair. Heidi's body was responding to his touch and her eyes closed as she enjoyed his touch. She was sure that she was in need of relief just from watching him pleasure her.</p> <p>One hand left his mouth as he stood up from his chair, his eyes never wavering between her legs. She watched his eyes as they wandered, taking in her nakedness and his cock in his hand. He leaned forward and kissed her lightly and she felt his body lean against hers, which made her nipples swell and harden as she realized what he was doing. He kissed her for a long time, caressing her face and neck and making her feel as though she was on fire. His tongue was wet, warm and slippery, exploring her mouth and she opened wider to encourage him, to feel his desire.</p> <p>He slowly stroked his dick through the leg of his shorts; it seemed like it was on fire as he rubbed it over her pussy, feeling its soft wetness. He reached behind and with a hand, slowly pulled down the fabric of her thongs to reveal her pussy. Heidi's head was thrown back and she moaned as he continued to explore her with his fingers. This boy was experienced, and he didn't seem to mind that she was all wet and naked.</p> <p>He looked back up at her and she just smiled at him, wondering what it would be like to taste his hard dick.</p> <p>"I wonder how I could possibly fit this inside me." she told him, watching his eyes with those beautiful eyes. She was so happy with her new body.</p> <p>"Honey, if you would, um, let it..."</p> <p>His words were cut off by a pair of lips engulfing his dick. She opened her mouth and felt his large head penetrate her wet lips. Once inside, she felt him move back and forth, as his tongue slid in and out of her mouth, wetting it as he did his thing.</p> <p>His hand was on her pussy, and she felt it on her cheek. She watched as his eyes closed and his penis began to pound into her harder and harder.</p> <p>"What is it??" Heidi asked him. "What's happening??"</p> <p>"It's okay....It's good," he replied, "I like it.....It'll feel good if I let you do this."</p> <p>Heidi closed her eyes and smiled to herself. She felt a little sad and she leaned back slightly but she continued to watch, knowing that he'd be able to make her cum, and that it wouldn't be long, before he was ready to go. His penis was pounding into her now and she could feel the semen rising, threatening to rise in the heat of her vagina. Heidi knew she needed release, but the idea of her cum making it's way from her pussy down to her own body was like a drug for her now. She was sure he wanted her to cum, but she wanted more. She wanted to feel him cum inside of her, even though his penis wasn't in her, and she'd never had a second chance. She leaned back a bit more, raising her chest out of the way without breaking the momentum of his thrusting.</p> <p>"Oh god," she was almost gasping for breath, "oh god, oh god...."</p> <p>He held himself deep inside her as their bodies moved in unison, her breasts jiggling back and forth asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
