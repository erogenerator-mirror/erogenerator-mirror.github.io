He could not resist the urge to answer it, but knew how he had come to think that he was in deep trouble.</p> <p>'Hello Daddy.'</p> <p>'Hello dear. I have the meeting arranged for eleven o'clock at your school.'</p> <p>'Yes Daddy. But why?'</p> <p>'Because my little girl is coming,' he paused, looking at his reflection before continuing. 'Her new teacher is here. He's going to teach her all she knows about sex for the first time. And he's going to teach her to suck cock for the first time. Can you be in two seconds?'</p> <p>'Um...I think so and yes, that's fine.'</p> <p>'And I'll be waiting for you so I can tell when he's done with her.'</p> <p>'Oh I'll be in the classroom at eleven.'</p> <p>'Good. Then I'll see you when my wife gets home from school. She's going to be so sore for a few days.'</p> <p>'You've done enough already!'</p> <p>'I'll just have to take one quick thing.'</p> <p>'I can't wait any longer. Come on in.'</p> <p>He entered the school corridor and paused outside her door. He saw the light was still on and he knew that if he turned the light in, she would come out at exactly twelve thirty.'</p> <p>'She still has her skirt on! It looked like she might be wearing stockings!'</p> <p>His hand was trembling in anticipation and he wanted desperately to touch himself but restrained himself. She was his daughter and she had every right to feel ashamed - especially when she opened his door wearing stockings.</p> <p>He entered her classroom and waited to see if she would notice him. She did not.</p> <p>'I think he left his phone on,' she said, her voice as cold as ice, 'and there were only a few minutes of silence!'</p> <p>He felt as if he were going to burst. She was furious with him but her voice was as cool as ice.</p> <p>'Oh your mother!'</p> <p>'Yes she's a woman, isn't she? I think she was in the toilet crying. I don't think anybody else knew what happened.'</p> <p>She turned towards him; her eyes were shining and her expression was calm and caring.</p> <p>'What happens here, can't I just leave it at that? You'll have to pay for all your troubles!'</p> <p>'No! It's not that! I'll pay for his troubles and, um, his wife gets out of the way,' he was having difficulty forming his thoughts but he managed not to make a face.</p> <p>'So you're going to teach her how the world works anyway. Well, just for what she wants.'</p> <p>She took his hand and kissed his fingers. Her lips were soft and slightly moist.</p> <p>'No! I don't mean any of that. I'll give her my word! Your mother's a woman, and I need to teach her to do everything she has to teach. She could give me any man in England!'</p> <p>He was stunned by her words. She was the first woman he had seen naked and he wanted to do anything to relieve the feeling that he had felt every time she was naked. If he was honest with himself, he felt as if he could see the inner truth in her words when they were together.</p> <p>When his wife, Susan, walked into the school, he knew she was the first woman he had seen naked. He had seen naked women before, many times in the bathroom; on his own; in his flat; in the hallway whilst Susan pretended to sleep on his bed. Only his wife and mother had been naked.</p> <p>When the two of them walked in, each of them was dressed as if she was a present. She was wearing the tightest mini-skirt, the one he had seen her in once before, showing her long shapely legs very nicely. Her blouse was very tight, almost transparent, almost translucent. Her jacket was transparent too, partly clinging to her boobs and partly covering her nipples. His eyes were drawn to the curves of her body and he could see her pubic hair under the fabric of her skirt.</p> <p>The other man in the room stared at her with wonder at how she had gone from being the shy, innocent schoolgirl that he knew to being that of someone in authority, who was now a full head mistress, who was his teacher, to a total submission and a cuckold. Susan took Mr Williams's face between her hands and kissed him on the lips, her tongue invading his mouth, stroking his tongue with hers and his mind raced with thoughts of what she could be like in bed.
