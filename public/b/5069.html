What's up?" He tried to find his voice, as his body became aware of his surroundings once again.</p> <p>"You're still awake." she said softly. "The other boy in the basement. He's asleep. He was in the basement with me." her tone becoming serious; like she was thinking about something. Her hand went to his chest, where she caressed his soft skin.</p> <p>"What's happening?"</p> <p>"He wants it. Will you be part of the team? That's it, he's awake now. I told him we were going to go on a date. We have to bring us something."</p> <p>"I don't see why I should worry...why would anyone else want me to marry him?"</p> <p>"He'll get bored of waiting and you and I will have a nice night. But, if you go after the next person, I'll be on you all night. What will I have to do." he whispered, his hands roaming over her body while he talked.</p> <p>"I don't know about that" she said, as she reached over him to close the basement, taking the opportunity to kiss him deeply.</p> <p>"I'll get the man at the hospital. It's going to be fine." she said, kissing him again, as her hand began to rub his chest, her hand brushing against his manhood.</p> <p>"Mmm, that feels good. It feels so good up here. Would you do it for me?" he asked, as his hand slid down between her thighs, rubbing against her clit, making her wet.</p> <p>"That is very good. It will be a very good night." she said, her head leaning back against his shoulder, as her fingers tangled themselves in his hair. "I'm so wet." she moaned, "I want you in me right now...please..."</p> <p>He began to fuck her with his fingers, pressing against her g-spot, making her writhe in delight, her voice soft and sexy, while she moaned and groaned. His thumb worked back and forth over her hard nipple, making her jump against the wooden door. He slid his hand down her neck, squeezing her breasts together, feeling his cock jump against her pussy.</p> <p>"Yes. Oh yes..." she moaned softly, "please." she moaned, squeezing and pulling his hair. "Please, fuck me. Please fuck me now..." she whispered, her voice quivering.</p> <p>He pushed her back down into the ground, taking her by the hand and leading her down a hallway, to a bedroom. A small bathroom was in the center of the room, his fingers still rubbing her clitoris.</p> <p>"Now, you have to fuck me." she whispered, as she spread herself open on the bed.</p> <p>He climbed on top of her and pressed his cock against her pussy, pushing inside her.</p> <p>"Harder." she gasped, as she felt his cock deep inside her wet pussy.</p> <p>He slid his hand back, rubbing her clit. "No. Not there." he whispered. She pulled her legs up and grabbed his shoulder and rolled him backwards.</p> <p>“That's better." he whispered hotly into her ear.</p> <p>"Yes. Just like that." she replied.</p> <p>She began to move her hips up and down, feeling her orgasm rapidly approaching. The wetness that was filling her pussy increased with each thrust, as his cock slid against her g-spot while he moved his hands onto her breasts and rubbed her nipples.</p> <p>"Take my cock...cum in me. Cum for me." she panted.</p> <p>"You are such a dirty slut," he said, his fingers digging into her breasts.</p> <p>"You are more than a dirty slut," she moaned, as she felt his cock swelling inside her pussy. She felt her body shudder as she came while she felt him cum inside her.</p> <p>"What were you thinking about that was going to happen?" he asked, as he stood up, giving her one last kiss.</p> <p>Her pussy tightened around him. He knew that this was a special night, if he was going to end it with her. He put both of his hands on her breasts and squeezed them.</p> <p>"I love your breasts" he whispered, letting his lips linger gently around her ear as he whispered.</p> <p>As she looked into his eyes, she knew she wasn't the only one. Her thoughts of her husband were no longer the same.</p> <p>"You have an incredible body." he said, looking into her eyes, watching their eyes lock.</p> <p>"What's it to you? A slut? A whore?" she teased, as she moved—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
