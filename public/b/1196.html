Not only in every sense of the word, she was well-endowed and quite lovely. She had long, golden, auburn hair, bright-red lips and a very pretty face. She had breasts that were large and perky. Her legs were long and slender and shapely. Her bottom was high, with firm cheeks just beginning to show a hint of pink and that went well with her skin-tone and her long, shapely legs. As she stepped into the office, I wondered whether she had a pair of men's panties on or whether the whole thing was staged.</p> <p>"Come on in," I called to her when I got to her desk. She was leaning back on the desk, with her arms up by her side. As I started to open the door, I saw her blush some more and her breathing quicken.</p> <p>"It's okay, sweetie," I said as I turned to face her. "I won't tell you that you have to go back to work if you don't want to," I added softly. "Because you do." She blushed deeply again.</p> <p>"I know," I said, and I pulled her up until she was standing in front of me. I felt her body, just as I had expected. "And I think I saw you in them," I said, nodding to the crotch of her panties before I pulled them to the side. I could feel the soft hairs of her pubic hair brushing against my nose and even though my face was right there, I couldn't resist inhaling quickly as I took in the intoxicating scent.</p> <p>"I'm not sure about going back there," she said softly. She took a couple deep breaths that reminded me of a small cough, but she was already panting heavily.</p> <p>"Don't worry," I reassured her. "You can let the boss know before too long." I stepped around her to let her get in front of me. It seemed that I wasn't going to be forced to face the task of getting started, though.</p> <p>Taking a deep breath to get a bit of air in, I took a step forward, and almost casually moved my hands to her hips. I lifted her a few inches and wrapped them around her waist to hold her against me once more. I lifted her slowly again, the air feeling strange in my lungs and making her shudder. I moved my hands up and over her rib cage, then moved my hands up and under her breasts. I lightly played my fingers across the small, hard nubs of her small breasts that seemed to be straining to get free. I wanted to keep playing with them, but my hands couldn't feel the strength in her lower body that I could, that, in any other situation would be arousing. Instead, I moved my hands up and gently pinched both her nipples, eliciting soft moans from her soft lips. I lowered my hands. I wanted to feel her flesh, to play her skin, to feel the power of her body's reaction to my touch.</p> <p>"Oh..." she whispered, but her voice was still soft and hoarse. That's the truth. She was really, really enjoying my touch. I had no idea why my power of the universe had brought her here.</p> <p>"Go," I urged softly as I lifted her off the desk, and she immediately slid to her own chair.</p> <p>"So," I began after I got control of myself. I looked down at her, her legs splayed out and her breasts jiggling in response.</p> <p>"So..." I trailed off, as I thought back to all the times in the past, as a young lad, and even then I had thought of herself as a woman, a young woman, and I looked at this young lady's sexual body, knowing in my head that she was as beautiful as I found her.</p> <p>"Yes, and I still like a few things more than just a blowjob," I finished, almost in jest. We continued to watch each other and her nipples stood out like little towers in my palms, and it made me more aware of her body.</p> <p>"But what do I call what?" she asked as she sipped her water, and I could tell she was just getting to that part of the act. I moved my hands to her waist.</p> <p>"Do you mean what I think you mean?" I said.</p> <p>"Yes," she said.</p> <p>"Well, then ... what do you do with your body that's different?" I asked, putting a hand on her hip to get a little more direct contact with her skin.</p> <p>"Well..." she said, "I ... I wear dresses. Or..." she looked at her hands slowly. "Or..." she paused, looking about quickly. "You, you ... you think ... that Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
