In one corner were a large white desk and behind the desk on a wall was a tall, black leather sofa. There was a small black leather chair, and the only thing separating us were thin dark curtains. The office door had not been fully closed. I turned around, looking for an escape, but it was too late. He didn't hesitate.</p> <p>"Please, let me," he said and placed his arms around me, kissing me. "Please, I want to make love to you." His voice was soft, even sexy. I pulled him toward me, his cock sliding between my legs. It felt big and hard. Oh, yes, big. I was so wet. I wanted him inside me.</p> <p>He put his hands on my ass, sliding his hands upward until my own felt my breasts. As he found my nipples, he squeezed them roughly, causing my to moan and press against his cock. He knew. He rolled my nipples between his thumbs and fingers until they were hard, standing out from my chest, and then he slid them down my body to my belly. He bent his body, pushing my hips toward the desk, and he kissed me as his hands traced my body, over my hips, down my thighs, and up to my breasts. He took each nipple between his thumb and forefingers gently, then pinched lightly with the tips of his fingers as I pushed against his lower abdomen. He kissed me again and we kissed hungrily.</p> <p>"Please, love" he said. "I want you so badly, I know we will be here a few more weeks. If you won't do it with me, I will take you."</p> <p>"Oh, please, I'm begging you," I whispered, then he pushed me back on the desk, my legs still held open by his strong hands. He spread my knees open and pulled me toward him, my arms slipping around his neck. I wrapped my legs around his waist as he positioned himself with his big, black cock at my entrance. I wanted it now.</p> <p>In one swift motion, he had his cock sliding up and down my slick lips. I moaned and I felt his cock filling me up. He slid it, all the way in, and out, and in, and out. He was hard and hard, and I pushed my hips toward him, helping him drive himself all the way. He fucked me, his strong black hand gripping my thigh, his other hand resting on my chest. I wrapped my legs around his back, and he gripped my ass with both hands, his big, black hands gripping my ass, pulling me tight against his cock, all the way in, until we were both pushing against one another. He was so deep. I pushed against him, meeting his thrusting.</p> <p>I was his first conquest, and he was so long and hard. I needed to be fucked! I was his slut for now.</p> <p>"Make love to me," I whispered. "Please, make love to me now!"</p> <p>He kissed me again, and I felt his lips slide down my neck, across my collarbones until he reached my breasts. He cupped one breast and held the large, dark brown nipple between his lips, he moved the tip on one side, then the other, taking in my skin, sucking lightly. His hand slid down my body, pausing at my bellybutton. It dipped into the crease. He stroked it gently. My hips rose, seeking his cock like a snake on a hook. He lifted his head and moved his lips to my breast, sucking, taking my nipple in his mouth. I shuddered. Now his hand moved in a steady, measured rhythm, sliding up my thigh, down my calf, my thigh, until he reached the soft, warm flesh of my knee. Now he pushed my leg apart and moved in, first one then the other. He bent his arms and pulled my body back toward him so his chest was pressing into mine. My hands flew to his chest as I arched my back, pushing against his muscular abdomen, wanting him to take more, not just taking, but demanding. I could tell he was not the first to fuck me. I felt his cock slide across my clit again, and I pushed up against his abdomen once more.</p> <p>"God, I'm going to cum, oh, oh...fuuuuuuck!"</p> <p>He took my nipple and held it between his warm lips, sucking it softly. I moaned, feeling my pussy pulsing and throbbing. The sensation drove me toward another orgasm. He did not release it, but just held me like that. I felt his penis sliding across my clit, rubbing against it on each stroke.
