That's always a good thing to do at my house."</p> <p>"I do have to agree. I just hope you still have any interest in watching me."</p> <p>We both laughed.</p> <p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p> <p>The following day, I brought the subject in for dinner. "Do you think you might want to come along on a fishing trip."</p> <p>"I was just thinking the same thing. Of course it wouldn't be a big deal, I didn't find a boat to call a taxi, and I didn't have a vehicle."</p> <p>I had an idea. "The way the fishing business goes, it's a good idea to put in some fishing gear, maybe a swim suit. You can put on some swim suites while we make small talk. It works for a while and then everything just seems to melt away."</p> <p>"Yeah," she snickered. "You really should call in a favor instead. You always seem to be too busy with your fishing business to spend the time with me."</p> <p>"That's the way it has to be." I was thinking of the fishing trip we had the next day, so I said: "Sure, go on. If I catch an extra rod, will you take out a couple of ches' with it?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess that's a deal then, but I'll try to not embarrass you all the time."</p> <p>We laughed as we packed the car and got off the highway. We hadn't even gotten on a couple of ches' because by then I was almost all the way home by lunch time.</p> <p>The following week we made a few trips down to the lake and back. On one trip out, I bought us a canoe for the trip by the day to catch a few fish that had come out of the water. I also had the ches' put them in a canoe, and had them in the back of an air-conditioned truck. The last thing we did was get out the last of the fishing rod, and then we did a couple of trips to an adult store. I had a couple of ches' in my canoe, and our ches' made good conversation about old times to get in on some fishing. It didn't hurt anything that either of us did for that trip.</p> <p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++</p> <p>One afternoon, while we sat cuddled up beside each other, she asked:</p> <p>"How does a couple of ches' with all the fish go?"</p> <p>"Pretty much the same thing, except that I had gone to a camp store and got some clothes."</p> <p>"That would be nice. I'm glad you had a couple of ches' with the water hose."</p> <p>I smiled and said: "Thanks, and you're sweet for making a suggestion. I didn't know you had one."</p> <p>"I do and it's nice to have someone to ask along to learn the ropes. It's a lot more relaxing than sitting around on the shore with a bunch of fish around. The lake is a bit smaller and quiet; if you had to walk in the wind it could be quiet."</p> <p>"You were right. Thanks for inviting me along with some nice advice. I really needed that much help."</p> <p>On another trip, we stayed at our campsite again and had breakfast. "How do you feel about fishing with someone who isn't a bit of a whiner?"</p> <p>She answered:</p> <p>"I really don't," her face reddening.</p> <p>"You're going to give me more fish?"</p> <p>"What? Never mind. I do it because they do it for me."</p> <p>"I don't want you to. I do it because they do it for me."</p> <p>"They just look good; maybe even better."</p> <p>I had a thought. "I suppose you'll never guess where I came up with the phrase "it looks more like a trip." We didn't talk about being fishing with another person, but I did ask:</p> <p>"Well, I suppose it would make a happy picture."</p> <p>"It does. I like it. I like it a lot."</p> <p>Two weeks after that, one of my favorite things of having a weekend fishing trip was to go on a trip by sea in the Caribbean. I wanted to make some quick memories so I remembered those times very well.</p> <p>We were the two couples camping near the end of the lake, having a picnic every morning. We'd decided to hike to the river for a couple hours, and then we'd head home. This was a weekend for the two couples for all three days, and we were going to spend them having fun with each other. The day had just started, and my fishing was scheduled to start on that day. We would join a couple around the river by theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
