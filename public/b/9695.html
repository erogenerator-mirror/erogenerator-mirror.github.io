He stopped midword and shook his head. "I'm so sorry. I just didn't want to do something like this."</p> <p>I nodded and looked up at the stairs into one of the bedrooms. "But... but we're only going to be friends once?"</p> <p>"Honey, I need to go home... and fast." He turned to leave. "Come back after this was over?"</p> <p>"But I don't have a car...." I pointed to a car parked on the street. "Besides, I don't need someone to go pick me up tomorrow night. Come to think of it, you are going to be driving me anywhere."</p> <p>He looked confused and then smiled. "What? What do you mean?"</p> <p>I leaned my head towards him. "Come inside and we'll talk more when we're home."</p> <p>***</p> <p>"I don't know... I have to be in the bar this late." I said as we stood in line at the check-in desk. "The only way to get to my place and get in the truck right now is to pick me up and get me out of here."</p> <p>"We'll do it tomorrow night. You just don't have to be here, you have to be with..." Dave said as he waved his arm indicating that he and the others were already in line.</p> <p>I shook my head and smiled. "Dave, I just don't know what to think. There's so much we need to talk about."</p> <p>"No, I'll drive you home." Dave said with a smile and then turned to the woman behind the counter. "What is the price?"</p> <p>"Oh... $2000."</p> <p>"And...?" He asked.</p> <p>"I don't know. I'll talk to you tomorrow." The lady behind the counter said as she turned back to take a pen and a file from the register. "But not a good deal."</p> <p>"I guess not." The man behind the counter said as he waved the pen back and forth. "You think we can afford that?" He asked.</p> <p>Justine took a step forward and looked at him. "We can afford it." She said. "You know how expensive that is to drive anyway, but I'm not going to buy anything."</p> <p>"I told you. We have to talk." Dave said as he opened the truck door and got out.</p> <p>I watched as he got in and started the truck driving while the woman in the other truck looked around for a moment while someone else got out of the truck. They had driven about 10 minutes by the time I got ready to leave.</p> <p>I started walking away from them and turned when I was half way around the back of the car. "If you've got a problem with this, just come with me."</p> <p>"Not yet. Not tonight."</p> <p>"But not with me?"</p> <p>"No. Let's just not do it like this again." I said and then stood looking at her as we both looked at our hands on the counter tops.</p> <p>When I reached in the glove box and found a piece of paper with some papers inside. "Write down what time and where to meet tonight." I smiled at her and then looked back. She had a note on the back of her pad. "Don't wait too long." I smiled and wrote down the time and place for the date.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Dave and I talked about many things before we left the motel and he drove me to the bar. He had been driving since we got to the hotel, and I felt like I might as well go along because the car was getting old and he was making the best of it.</p> <p>"Hey, wait, I'm sorry, the seat isn't right."</p> <p>"Don't worry about that."</p> <p>A look of disappointment was on the face of the woman that worked behind the counter when we got to the bar. She smiled and made the same move I did, looking at the place.</p> <p>In all the time I had known her, she had always been cute, but now I knew she was different. She wasn't exactly dressed like I would have liked, but even so, she wasn't that kind of girl. Her outfit wasn't exactly what I wanted, but then again, I knew what I wanted.</p> <p>"Hey, what are you up to?" She asked as we walked in.</p> <p>"Hey, uh, um..." I stammered a bit as I looked into her eyes. "I thought we could get some room in the motel. Just to talk."</p> <p>"Well, we have a lot to talk about."</p> <p>"Yeah, wellâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
