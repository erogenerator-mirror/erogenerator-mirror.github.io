She took his hand and placed it on the bulge, he reached back to find it, and with a wink he reached it. She gave his hand a squeeze before he pulled it away.</p> <p>"Now take it easy, you don't want to cut it off do you?"</p> <p>"I know what I'd like to do though... it would be fun to see what it's like to have sex with a man... to make love."</p> <p>He reached down and took her hand, they were still moving in a slow fashion, he began to pull away from her.</p> <p>"I've never had it with you this far, please stop with this for a moment or two."</p> <p>"I don't want to stop, I want this, you're so desirable."</p> <p>"Then I shall stop."</p> <p>She leaned back and reached back and put her hands behind her head.</p> <p>"Oh, I can get away. You may look a bit silly if you know what I mean, but my legs are killing me. Please move."</p> <p>He moved into a comfortable position as she moved back behind him.</p> <p>"This is fun," she said as she moved close to him. She reached around with her arms, took his hand, and placed it on her breast. He took her nipple into his mouth.</p> <p>"Ooh," she said, and leaned back into him. "Oh, I think this thing would fit inside me. That's so nice."</p> <p>He pulled the hood of her breast back from her body. With his other arm he reached around and found her clit.</p> <p>"You said you wanted to know things. I want to learn them."</p> <p>"As you wish," he replied as he moved his finger over her erect clit. She moved her hips to feel more of his finger over her body as if it were his cock.</p> <p>"Let's try."</p> <p>With this she felt him move his leg so he was straddling her leg, he took his finger away from her clit at the same time his fingers began to move on her nipple.</p> <p>"Do you want to try?" he asked looking deep into her eyes.</p> <p>"Yes," she almost whispered.</p> <p>"Are you sure you won't mind?"</p> <p>"No, I don't mind at all."</p> <p>He moved his hand away, and pulled it up her front, and found her breast again. She reached back to take his hand and helped. He began stroking his fingers back and forth across her breast as she moved the breast, feeling the nipple grow as he began to do so.</p> <p>"I think I can feel it," she said softly.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't know, what would you like better, or better?"</p> <p>"I don't know. Tell me what feels nice, please."</p> <p>"Would you like me to do something?"</p> <p>"Yes, I want to feel you touch me."</p> <p>"Ok."</p> <p>She moved his hand to her other breast, feeling it also. She held it firmly in her hand.</p> <p>"Oh!" she gasped, as he stroked her other leg, she reached down and took his cock in her hand. She couldn't believe he was doing it all. She took his fingers from her breasts, and she held them up to her mouth to taste them for the first time.</p> <p>She had no idea what he expected or what she wanted.</p> <p>She was just feeling very happy at the thought his hands were able to feel her body. She closed her eyes as he moved his other leg so each hand could touch and stroke.</p> <p>"Oh God," she said as his hand moved her thigh higher until it touched her slit. He moved his fingers up and down her slit as he continued to caress.</p> <p>"Oh," she said again, feeling the moistness of his fingers slide over her.</p> <p>"You are so wet." The sound was almost a moan.</p> <p>"Yes," she whispered again.</p> <p>"I could use a nice little orgasm for a while," he said as he continued to stroke her hair.</p> <p>"Please?"</p> <p>"Please what?"</p> <p>"I'll do anything."</p> <p>Dana opened her eyes and looked at him. Her mind was now clouded with his question.</p> <p>"If you don't mind."</p> <p>"I love you, I never thought I could love anyone I know better."</p> <p>"I loved you more than I can say. I would never leave you."</p> <p>"Just stay like that." They looked at each other for a long minute or so as she lay her head on his shoulder.</p> <p>He pulled back to get a good look at her face. Her eyes were closed.
