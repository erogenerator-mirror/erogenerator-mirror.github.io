That way, there is something nice we can talk about."</p> <p>"OK, if I have a spare key, we can get into your son's old Camaro!"</p> <p>I had no idea what he meant, but we got to my own neighborhood. Dad had been driving in that Camaro for the last fifteen years and always had a good time.</p> <p>"Well, I'll show you the ride, so be quiet!" Dad called out after our father and I climbed in and dad headed upstairs.</p> <p>I turned on the TV to watch a little TV for awhile when I heard Dad walking into the house. We just sat there for a minute watching the TV as Dad stripped off his shirt and tossed it into a corner of the room. I had never seen Dad naked before, except for the old army photo album.</p> <p>When Dad walked out of the bedroom, he was naked and I heard him say, "I thought I'd bring you a drink and help you relax."</p> <p>I knew it was wrong to be drinking, but I figured at least Mom and Bob would be coming. He was also naked, and was standing next to my couch chair with my coffee in his hand.</p> <p>"I think I'm about to get a little drunk," He said.</p> <p>"Do you want me to fix you something Mom?" I wondered.</p> <p>"No, thanks" Dad said, "I was just about to sit in my chair and watch TV with you. I'll be a little nap. Is that OK?"</p> <p>"Sure," I told him.</p> <p>When I looked down from beneath my arm, I watched as his hard cock appeared. Dad wasn't a huge man! I guessed he was about 9 and a quarter inches long and about an inch and a half thick. I noticed that Dad was circumcised, and he looked more circumcised than most guys I knew.</p> <p>I was about to call out to Mom and tell her to leave, but Dad said, "I'll go get the drinks."</p> <p>He went into the study and returned after a few minutes with a bottle.</p> <p>"Here," He said giving my arm, "Drink this for me!"</p> <p>Dad took a sip of his coffee then said, "I'm sorry I didn't say you could go to sleep."</p> <p>"No, thank you," I said taking Dad's hand. "You just relax, I'll be asleep pretty quick if we're alone! I'm not a slut, Dad, so it's no big deal."</p> <p>Dad was a little confused by my comments, but he went on like I had always been around. His dick was already beginning to harden.</p> <p>"No, relax, Mom needs to go to bed." Dad said. "Besides, if you want, I can have the key for you!"</p> <p>"You'll have to help me," I told him. "I don't mind."</p> <p>I was starting to get pretty drunk and my body was beginning to sweat, but I wasn't exactly a model for my Dad, so it didn't seem to matter.</p> <p>When he came back, he gave me a blanket.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," he said. "I've been feeling kind of nervous over your mother going to bed after such a long time."</p> <p>"Oh, no you don't," I told him. "Besides, you're too old to have a kid."</p> <p>"I'm 18, so she won't look 10 years old, but I won't have any kids in another 12 years!" Dad said. "Besides, I know a young woman that would like what I've been doing!"</p> <p>I'm sure that he laughed at that. I think maybe he was joking, because he had that same look on his face again.</p> <p>"OK, I'll help you!" He said. "The TV."</p> <p>I didn't even bother shutting the TV as I grabbed my coffee. I walked to the couch.</p> <p>Dad got a blanket and went and sat on the couch with me. We sat and talked for a while. It was only a ten minute walk to the back yard with a few quick stops at various places we could use the break room as well as the back yard. Dad's car was there; I took the opportunity to go see if Mom could get him his drink. I found him with a blanket and a towel drying his hair. I was just pulling back the towel when he said, "You OK?" I turned and gave him a dirty look.</p> <p>"Yes I am," I told him, "but I'll be able to get it out in the morning."</p> <p>I turned around toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
