It sounded strangely familiar but I couldn't place it. "Are you in there, the one with what she had in mind?" The woman in the black dress asked.</p> <p>"You want me to come over and find them?" I asked. If I was going to get the woman in this mess, she might as well make damn sure there was no way I got back to them until after she and her companions came.</p> <p>"Oh, yes you're that, my dear boy. Come and join us, dear. I'll be with you in a moment."</p> <p>"What...how do you know where the others are?" I asked. I couldn't stand to walk around like this, so I went back to my room and laid down on the bed where I had just been.</p> <p>I woke to the sounds of laughter and giggling coming softly from my room. I turned my head to see a man laughing with his face scrunched up against his pillow.</p> <p>"Good morning, boy," the man said smiling at me. "I hope to meet you shortly on the ranch."</p> <p>"Of course you will," I said. "I have just got off of work and now it's only nine. Where do you live, boy?"</p> <p>The man laughed again and pulled himself off the bed. "There's a little private cabin up on the hill." He said. "You can stay there and sleep in the bed."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I wondered as he walked off toward the door toward the house with me in tow. "I'll see you in a day or two."</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Chapter 3: The Surprise</p> <p>"You okay with this, honey?" the man asked me as we sat eating coffee out in his house.</p> <p>"I guess I think so," I smiled. "That little adventure we just had...has to wait."</p> <p>"Oh yes it does," the man nodded smiling. "Just wait, don't worry about anything. You'll just be on your way."</p> <p>"Oh, man, you're going to kill us on here," I laughed.</p> <p>"Now then," the man replied. "What is this place called? I've only heard it once. They gave me this house just for this occasion. Are you okay with this, dear?"</p> <p>"I guess so." I said truthfully. "Thank you for everything. I know it isn't as glamorous as yours. Here is my card for you."</p> <p>"I'll pass it over anyway," the man replied smiling.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Chapter 4: The Surprise</p> <p>Once inside the house, things really started to heat up. The man who had been carrying me was quickly whisked from the small room by a young woman who was sitting on the sofa.</p> <p>"What are you doing here, honey?" the man asked.</p> <p>"Oh, nothing really." I answered. "I was having a lot of fun."</p> <p>"Oh, you were?"</p> <p>"Of course I was," I said. "How many people do you know live here?"</p> <p>"Twenty maybe. Your father brought me here and we're all here."</p> <p>"Oh, why didn't you tell me this place before?" I asked.</p> <p>"My father's a good man," his mother said. "He's been with us so long that I guess he figured you would want to experience it too. Your father's a doctor. He was born in America."</p> <p>"We're from Texas."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, my mother."</p> <p>"We're from Texas," Mr. White announced.</p> <p>I frowned thinking about my father. He worked in a doctor's office and did a pretty good job. He seemed to know everything about some of the local doctors because whenever I came to his office, they gave me his card. Maybe once or twice a week he was able to get me to go on any type of work visit. It reminded me of when I was a teenager after Dad died.</p> <p>"And what was your dad's name this time?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh, he died about three years ago."</p> <p>We talked briefly about my father before we went to bed. Mr. White had his eyes closed for nearly twenty minutes when he came out of the room. "I see you were enjoying the company of the others too," he said as he left the room.</p> <p>"Oh, I did enjoy every minute of it, thank you."</p> <p>"So how did the night go?"</p> <p>"Oh, it was a lot of fun."</p> <p>"I hope you're not too hungry."</p> <p>"No, I'm fine. This room can use a break."</p> <p>"Let me help you up."</p> <p>"Thank you.
