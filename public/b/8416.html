I started to thrust hard and fast into her but she stopped me again. I wanted to feel her again but this time I wanted her ass! I kept my weight off her body and started to press my full length inside of her. She had already cum twice but still had a very tight grip around my cock. I pulled out and flipped around and laid her on her back. I pushed her legs up to her chest and pounded her again with vigor.</p> <p>"Oh my god, ohhhh my god!" she screamed in response. I didn't care that she knew about our relationship.</p> <p>"Cum again," I told her. She grabbed my ass and pushed harder against me and cried out as she felt me cum again. My cock began to grow as it started to come to life. This time, I pounded even harder into her as I came again.</p> <p>"Fuck me!" she cried again, reaching her hand around my body and began rubbing my cock. I fucked her even harder now. "Oh god," she squealed as she moved her body under me, pushing up against me. We remained on the bed as I continued pounding into her.</p> <p>"Fuck me!" she cried. I reached my hand between us and began to rub her clit. We both came again. Her pussy clamped down like a vise onto my cock as we both climaxed. It got dark as we sat on my bed. She reached for the blanket and threw it over us as she collapsed into my arms.</p> <p>We lay there in each others arms. The lights in her room were dim but we both needed her company. I felt her body shift against me so I lifted my head off her chest and looked at her. I could tell she had changed clothes again. Her tank top was getting a bit longer and I could see a bit of cleavage in them from the motion of her arms. I could tell she had a small tattoo over her shoulder.</p> <p>"How do I look," I said. "I hope you're not disgusted by my cock?"</p> <p>She was blushing and nodded her head.</p> <p>"Yeah. Just a little worried," she said quickly.</p> <p>"I told you you were a very good fuck," I told her. "Now tell me to turn over," I commanded her.</p> <p>"I said I was yours and yours alone until Sunday. If I don't do something about tonight, I'll make up with you when I get back," she answered.</p> <p>"That's all right," I replied. I rolled over and turned her over. "Roll over and get on your hands and knees," I told her.</p> <p>"Are you sure about this," she asked me.</p> <p>"Yes," I answered. "I want to take you doggy style." I took my semi-erect cock in my right fingers and began rubbing the head against her anus. She lifted her ass into the air and my cock slipped in easily. It had been a long time but I could tell it was tight.</p> <p>"Fuck me," she said as she pulled herself up to me. "Fuck my pussy and make me cum." I couldn't but oblige. I slammed my cock inside and held on as long as I could before I exploded inside of her as her pussy clamped down hard on my cock.</p> <p>We both heard someone screaming and it stopped immediately. She lay on the bed staring at the ceiling. "It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be," she said. She turned to face me.</p> <p>"I can't do it again, I'm so sorry. I have to make a decision soon," she said.</p> <p>It was too late now. I didn't feel any guilt or disgust. I was happy we needed to talk and share our emotions and we needed to know each other more fully before we went our separate ways. She looked at me so passionately that night. It wasn't sex but it felt like that. I was sure she felt similar to me.</p> <p>The next day we had breakfast together in her room when she mentioned we were going to make a movie. I wasn't a fan of that idea but I was on vacation.</p> <p>I decided to take her to her grandparents to meet with their family. She said she wanted to just talk so we could make us feel more at home, a little like we did in our college days, but it would mean leaving school. She also said she wanted me to see the way her mother acted and that she had to make it.</p> <p>I was at the family dinner and she didn't want to drink her wine. However, I wanted to ask her for something that I had seen her do when she didn't want anything. I sat across the table with her and took her glass againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
