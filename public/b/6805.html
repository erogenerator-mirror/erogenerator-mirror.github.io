I saw them all the time. And then we sat down. And I talked to them about being a woman before, and then we talked about making love, and we talked about how we'd like the other one to be made to feel wonderful."</p> <p>"Shelly?"</p> <p>"Yeah?"</p> <p>"If we were as compatible as you are, maybe we could decide when we're ready to move on to swinging. Just for the record."</p> <p>"I'm with you, Scott." She was looking at him with a loving, satisfied smile.</p> <p>She said, "That's good to hear, because we really want to make those decisions right now."</p> <p>She looked thoughtful.</p> <p>"We haven't had the opportunity to do anything more with them," Scott said.</p> <p>"But we've always known what we wanted. Now, we just need to get our asses over here for one of our many threesomes." Shelly gave Scott a big smile. "Thank you."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Later on that night, she and Scott were sitting at the dinner table. They were chatting, and they were having great time.</p> <p>Shelly had just finished her first drink. She'd already been down to just a sip.</p> <p>"That was great," she said. "You were right."</p> <p>"We've just got to make sure that we're compatible," Scott said.</p> <p>"I know," she replied as she took a long sip of brandy. "I mean, if I had the chance, I'd like to just make it a threesome. I mean ... you know, I can't believe that's really possible."</p> <p>"You know that's crazy, and it's a pretty good idea, so that's what I'm saying."</p> <p>Shelly sighed.</p> <p>"It just seems, well ... weird, so, well ... yeah ... I guess."</p> <p>"We're gonna have a good threesome," Scott said. "You're a very talented artist."</p> <p>She grinned.</p> <p>"I like your music."</p> <p>"It's very nice," Scott agreed. "I wonder what you could want out of being able to make love with your wife."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The next night, Lisa sat down and took out a new CD. It was a song called, "In the Garden of Innocence."</p> <p>"You like it?" Lisa asked.</p> <p>"Very much," Scott replied, nodding his head toward the CD. "I mean, I had no idea that it would sound so good, and I mean, what did you think about it?"</p> <p>"It kind of sounds like it's right," Lisa said.</p> <p>Shelly came over to them, and as Lisa sat down, she looked Scott in the eyes and said, "Have you ever made love on the floor of a bedroom?"</p> <p>Scott blushed.</p> <p>"Yeah," Scott replied. "I really like that."</p> <p>"What else did you think of it?" Lisa asked. "Or, are you jealous?"</p> <p>"No, I can't say. But, well, I guess we'd better make sure," Scott said as he reached out to take Lisa's hand and pull her up again.</p> <p>When they got back to the bedroom, they laid Lisa on the bed, then Scott laid next to her. They kissed, and kissed some more.</p> <p>They looked into each other's eyes and smiled.</p> <p>"It's been a few years, and I don't think you know it yet."</p> <p>"Can I ask you something?" she asked.</p> <p>"Anything."</p> <p>"Could I be honest with you?"</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"Have you ever done sex with another man?"</p> <p>Scott chuckled.</p> <p>"You know, I guess that can be a little embarrassing I guess."</p> <p>"Nonsense," Lisa said. "I want to ask you this, but you'll have to ask me later."</p> <p>"I don't think so," Scott said. "We can try anything with you, but I don't know exactly where things have been going, but even if we did decide that we could always get it off our chest, then that would be a different story. I don't know about you, but I'm aching my balls to go to the gallows and see what happens," he laughed. "You know, I haven't been in any sex since we got back together, and I guess that just isn't enough for me."</p> <p>"Don't worry," Lisa said. "I have to think more about that."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>That night, Scott got a drink of brandy.</p> <p>He then looked at Lisa and said, "I think we should talk."</p> <p>He took her hand and lifted it. â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
