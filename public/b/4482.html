I could hear her smile. "Doesn't he feel good?"</p> <p>"Yeah. Oh I don't know..." She moaned her words, and I felt her hips lift up slightly. "You are so beautiful."</p> <p>I knew it was me, and there was nothing I could do to change it, nothing but fuck her, and we both felt it, and we both came harder then ever, and made each other so wet we were dripping, and we both came again, and we both loved it this time.</p> <p>I'm not sure how long we made love, or what we did, but I had never felt like that. It was good, not really good, but it was better than good. It wasn't sexual, as much fun as it was sexual, but it was not sexual, although the two of us both wanted it, and we both loved fucking it, and it was not sexual, but it was still good.</p> <p>When we were finished I went to lie down, and she rolled on hers, and I lay on my own side. We were both tired, tired enough to sleep, and tired enough that I had a hard time thinking about her, what we had done, and our future relationship. The problem was that I didn't want to do either of those things. She was right. We hadn't kissed, or touched each other in our entire relationship. It didn't mean anything. It meant nothing.</p> <p>"I don't know how long we will keep going, but it will be more than we have left to say when we are together. It is about two weeks, and it is the same between us if I can get it."</p> <p>"You mean we can just leave whenever we want?"</p> <p>"No, not unless we meet and decide what we want to go home to, or decide for ourselves. If we decide we want to live together, that's another two weeks. I want to stay with you, but if we decide later that is a little more. So if we decide to get together and live together it's not even going to be like we planned."</p> <p>"Oh, it doesn't really matter, because it is still going to be my decision anyway, and I won't have a problem with that."</p> <p>"Yes, its part of whatever we are going to do, and you should too, since you did something as you planned for each of us."</p> <p>"Really? You wouldn't say anything?" I asked, surprised, but she didn't seem to be going to get angry with me.</p> <p>"No, I wouldn't. Besides, even I wasn't exactly sure what your mother would say. I just figured if she saw you with me you would feel guilty about it so we could stop talking about it. Well, after that talk we couldn't stop talking about it, but that was only because she never liked us, and we never found out. We are now just friends. But it is better than this arrangement."</p> <p>I felt a little better suddenly, because there was nothing else I could say, except we needed to make that decision together. It was as simple as that. But the situation was different, with someone else that I trusted, and I loved doing the things she used me to do, without him, and she didn't. I didn't want to think about doing those things with him either, but they might work, and at the same time it seemed like the only way we were ever going to have sex anymoreâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
