The shop quickly grew silent; none of the shoppers had noticed them approach, nor was one of the women at the counter.</p> <p>At the counter, there was a large glass-walled display displaying an assortment of vegetables, fruits, meats, and cheeses from the market, along with a wide assortment of liquors.</p> <p>Nathan walked back towards her as John followed, not being able to suppress a smile as his little sister looked around the shop so closely.</p> <p>"You said you would keep an eye on the market. What is it?" he asked, and the saleslady nodded and smiled.</p> <p>"Yes, and I'm still open," she said, and the young man looked puzzled.</p> <p>"Yes, a lot of people like to eat something to eat," the young man said, nodding as the girls walked towards him, holding hands and looking into his eyes. He held his hands out in front of him and smiled, and she noticed with fascination that his hands were covered in pink-brown, scalloped-heeled mules. There were many colored leather straps of various colors, and she saw his middle finger in a very dark color.</p> <p>He held hands with the girls in front of him but did not seem to move his fingers. When he opened his eyes, Samantha noticed right away, and moved towards him immediately, with her pink-red mules over her feet. As the young man looked at her, he smiled, and nodded as he looked in her face, and saw her smile too.</p> <p>"I'll take it," he said, and walked towards her as she closed the door.</p> <p>Samantha watched as her two children followed, and he smiled as they approached, showing a big smile. When Samantha looked at them again, she suddenly felt really nervous as she stood there looking from one of them to another; she could feel her heart pounding in her chest as her nervousness intensified.</p> <p>"What is going on," she said to each of them in turn, holding the mules over her feet and smiling at their expressions. They nodded, and she looked at her son, who seemed as confused as she felt. She turned her back to their young faces. "I'm glad I'm doing this," she said, putting her hands gently on her waist.</p> <p>"What are you going to do with your hands?"</p> <p>"They're too young," she said, looking away to the floor.</p> <p>"I bet," John said.</p> <p>"I'm going to go and put the money into my purse," she said, and they nodded and followed her. She turned and looked back at them as they walked towards their house.</p> <p>"Okay," she said.</p> <p>"Please don't tell anyone we went into town?" the young man asked, smiling.</p> <p>Samantha nodded.</p> <p>"I said we were going."</p> <p>"That's fine. If people knew we were going to stop by for food right there, they would have called the cops," John said, and then pointed to a store next to the entrance.</p> <p>Samantha took the money and nodded to him, and followed it towards the entrance. The entrance was empty... not the last she had seen. As she went inside, she saw the man in the same black suit he had been wearing when he walked in.</p> <p>"Yes, we have our money in here. Are you going to watch? I just wanna help you out," he said, his voice as stern as he would have one of the cops. All other patrons, including Samantha, had a look of surprise on their face as she entered the store. There were bottles of some sort up against a counter that had a door, as well as a few shelves full of the various foods.</p> <p>Samantha nodded and looked back towards the man in the suit. He was a tall man, much taller than most people, though with dark hair that reached his forehead.</p> <p>"Why are you in here?" she asked him, looking up questioningly at him, as he smiled and waved.</p> <p>"I found a man who had a business proposition. I told him he was not a good business and would not work if he didn't do as he was told, and that would mean paying for a new car and taking off my money to pay my rent. He agreed. I'm glad he does that," he said, and she felt a smile as he spoke of the man she had just passed.</p> <p>"I'm glad too, that I have saved you from going to jail foreverâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
