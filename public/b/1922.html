I was going to do that."</p> <p>We kissed again and started to move inside.</p> <p>"God I'm so wet," she declared.</p> <p>"Honey I'm sure we'll be doing lots more than just kissing. You're just going to have to get rid of this little thing," and I felt her pull back.</p> <p>"Oh God, I can't move, I can't move," she insisted.</p> <p>"Let me help you stand," I said, and we slowly stood up on the kitchen floor. The kitchen floor was carpeted in soft pink from our earlier love making.</p> <p>I had a towel around my neck. Lying down on it we kissed again. Her mouth felt so soft on mine and, I felt her hands start exploring my body. Her fingers felt so good on the sensitive skin beneath my bra cups, but just the touch of her little fingers didn't feel good enough.</p> <p>I helped her lay back on the kitchen floor as she spread her legs apart. I was looking straight into her little pussy when I felt the warm wet warmth of her vagina.</p> <p>I slowly licked her pussy, making sure she really got to the clitoris and then began moving my tongue up and down her lips and vagina, going a little deeper each time.</p> <p>She was moaning softly and then suddenly let go. She was totally overcome and didn't need any more encouragement, her whole body went completely limp.</p> <p>As if she were exhausted she pushed my head away from her pussy.</p> <p>"What time is it, are you coming, or do you want me to turn the lights off."</p> <p>"How did you know that?" I said with a grin as I pulled my panties back on.</p> <p>"What do you need me and Mom to do," she said with a chuckle.</p> <p>She rolled on her back and said, "Let's go find something to eat, then we can watch some television. I want to make you cum."</p> <p>"I just finished another couple of drinks, and I'm a little light headed right now. What shall we do?" I asked.</p> <p>"Make it a game, a dare, or even a long story."</p> <p>"I'm game," I said and laughed, "what would you prefer?"</p> <p>"Whatever you want," she said and we went over to the end of the dining table. I grabbed a chair from the back of the room, picked my spot on the other side of it and told Nancy to sit on the end.</p> <p>We each got our towels and spread them out in front of our new toy. We each took a piece of paper and wrote down our names:</p> <p>Jules Dormer, age 22. Lani Dormer, age 25. Lenny Dormer, age 28. Anna Dormer, age 29. Ann O'Toole, age 30. Lillie Dormer, age 34. Carol Dormer, age 27.</p> <p>Nancy had just completed her story. I had to admit, she had written just as much detail and detail about herself as I had.</p> <p>"Well, the game is going to be something fun," I said.</p> <p>Nancy laughed, "Yeah, it's so fun." Nancy and Lillie both had their wine and sat back against the table to watch the game.</p> <p>"The game is not a game, is it?" Lillie asked.</p> <p>"Oh no. The game is a dare game with someone who you know well and you have won for the night," she said and then said, "We won't tell when we get back to my place."</p> <p>"That was a joke," Lillie protested.</p> <p>"We won't tell unless you say you aren't going to be a good girl," Carol agreed. I decided I would tell them if we did see her the next day.</p> <p>Lillie laughed again and said, "Well, let's hope you haven't got in some kind of trouble. Do you have any idea how to put a girl through their paces?"</p> <p>Nancy asked, "Are you sure you're okay with this as far as the game goes?"</p> <p>"I'm sure that if you ask me anything I won't push you away," Lillie replied and then she laughed.</p> <p>Nancy said, "Now I'm getting a little cold. Can you stay and sit with us until we're done?"</p> <p>"Sure, if you don't mind, but I'd really like to stay for a while. They have food and a movie to make you feel good."</p> <p>Nancy laughed, "Let's just find a place to sit, so weâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
