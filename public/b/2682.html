"And what is that about? I've asked and you haven't answered? I've been looking for you. I need a good job and you seem to be the perfect choice."</p> <p>"I'm...um," Sarah hesitated, "I'm not sure if I can actually go through with this."</p> <p>"Oh I think you can," he smiled. "There is a chance that you may even want to. I've heard the rumors around the office about you. But then again, there is also a chance that you're not even really a woman, and when it comes down to it, you've got plenty of tits. You can have them now. They are too heavy to be a bra. Hell, you're got to be a C before I get that big a bonus if you want to have them. And I'd like to see them for my private collection," he said with a grin. "I can give my best men a good picture of your tits just to see what they'd look like without their clothes. And I'd really like to get a bit of the merchandise myself..."</p> <p>He reached out tentatively, his fingers tentatively touching her arm.</p> <p>"You're sure this is a good idea?" he asked, his hand gently cupping her shoulder.</p> <p>"I'm positive," she smiled gently.</p> <p>He leaned forward and kissed her on the lips. "You are so damn sweet. And I'm glad you are happy to finally give in to me."</p> <p>He leaned back against the table and lifted Sarah over his shoulder. They quickly undressed each other completely as he carried her to the bathroom. The cold water was heavenly. He had felt the warmth of her skin, the firm grip of her arms, the firm press of her breasts. He quickly got on the tiled floor and she turned and leaned over him. Their hips ground together. Her hips were soft as skin, so he moved her around a bit, so he could get a better feel of her. He could do that. He loved how she would move around him. It was so sensual and intimate.</p> <p>"Oh God, John," she breathed in his ear as he moved his hands down her back to her ass, massaging it gently. She moaned as he cupped both of her cheeks with his hands. "I'm starting to get really horny again. This is nice..." and she giggled.</p> <p>"Really nice?" he chuckled, smiling. "And you really like to feel my dick inside you, don't you, Sarah?"</p> <p>"I do," she purred. "That's what it feels like."</p> <p>"Good. I'm glad you are enjoying this. That doesn't mean we're never going to be together," he chuckled.</p> <p>She laughed, then leaned forward and kissed him. "And you already know what that means."</p> <p>He smiled and wrapped his fingers through her hair, pulling her hair back gently as he moved her back up to lie on the bathroom floor.</p> <p>"So do you want me to make you feel good?" he asked her tenderly.</p> <p>"Oh God you know I do. Please do," Sarah smiled. "I really need this."</p> <p>"Me too," He grinned, kissing her again.</p> <p>They stood on the marble floor for several seconds, before he turned her around and began to undo the buttons of her shirt. He pulled it off and she shucked it off her arms. They pulled their clothes off together and fell on the bathroom floor. Then he reached down and pulled her to him as he pulled his own shirt off and discarded it on the floor beside the tub.</p> <p>"You're very nice," he whispered in her ear as he ran a hand up her bare leg to her ankle.</p> <p>"So are you," she laughed softly. "I didn't think that it wasn't this important when I wanted to get you back for helping me with my first guy. And I didn't think it was really important until you got me off..."</p> <p>"I'm glad that I could help you," he smiled. "Now I want you to turn around so I can take off the rest of your clothes."</p> <p>"I wish you could," she snuggled back and waited for him to unhook her bra at the same time as he did her panties. "But this is my first time..."</p> <p>"Let me help you with those," he said as he helped her back onto the bathroom floor and stood up behind her.</p> <p>She wrapped her arms around him and pulled him down onto the bed. He fell onto his back and she pulled him inside her, kissing him deeply. She felt his hands come up to the top of her legs to her hips so she wrapped them around his neck.
