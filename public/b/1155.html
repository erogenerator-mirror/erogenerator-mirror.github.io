That was all it took. She erupted in wave after wave, her body shaking all over. She cried out repeatedly, but didn't care. All he wanted her to do was cum, that's all he wanted. He sucked her clit into his hot mouth and rubbed his tongue on it. He could see that her legs were trembling in the cool. He pulled her legs up until her hot pussy was touching his cock. He pushed it deep into her hot wet pussy. He didn't care about the cold anymore. He moved inside her until she went over the edge again. He could feel her convulsing as her pussy clenched around him. He pulled out of her, grabbed his cock and started rubbing it across her clit. "Oh no! Oh No! Oh no," she cried as she came again on his big dick. The heat of her pussy made her cum and the coldness was not enough anymore. He grabbed her hips and slammed his cock against her hot opening. He could feel the tip of his cock start to come up her. She was tight and hot. He grabbed her hips and started fucking her again as she started to moan. He felt it as more juices flooded his dick. She was getting wet enough that it didn't bother him. He kept fucking her until he had cum once more.</p> <p>Cumming in her was all he had hoped for. He felt as though he would come again. He pulled out of her and she collapsed on the desk top. She was just as hungry for him as she needed.</p> <p>When she was clean he climbed into the bed on top of her. They made love for the most magical minute of the night while still kissing and caressing her body. She was so beautiful he couldn't get enough of her. Even though he was trying to get it up again and couldn't do it she kept looking at him. He couldn't believe how much he loved her. It made the night so much more special. He reached down between their bodies and found her soaking wet, her pussy ready for him. He wanted to make her happy. His cock was hard and throbbing and he knew he was aching all over to fuck her right there. He knew she liked it as well. "Lay back and let me taste you."</p> <p>"Please," she begged. "I don't have a condom around."</p> <p>"It's ok," he said. "We both know they're not on. Please tell me you want me inside you."</p> <p>"Please," she said. "I want you in me. Fuck me."</p> <p>He moved between her legs and eased the head of his cock into her. It felt so good. He slid it all the way into her tight pussy.</p> <p>"I thought you'd never ask," he said.</p> <p>"Oh you better." She said as she wrapped her legs back around his hips and started moving with him. He watched as he watched her naked breasts bounce up and down as he rammed into her wet pussy. He loved watching her breasts bounce as her pussy tightened around his cock. It was a really sexy sight.</p> <p>She looked up at him as he started moving faster and faster. She was fucking him back as he was fucking her. Her breasts were bouncing up and down as he fucked her faster and harder than he had before. It was as though he was getting the best of both worlds. Their orgasms started and they couldn't stop. When they finally got to the end they made out on the desk on the side of the room.</p> <p>"I love you," she said just before they came.</p> <p>"I love you tooâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
