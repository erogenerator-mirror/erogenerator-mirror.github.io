I asked and tried to smile with a smile, rather than to laugh.</p> <p>"I can assure you that I have some good reasons to be excited about your next date; one that I'll have trouble covering in my mind; like, whether you'll be getting any in college, or whether you'll be taking any," She answered. "Besides, it's not that I wouldn't want to get in to college, or, or, well, not exactly, so you can take me over his knee that first time," She concluded. "What you did for me was fun, I could've had several more before the day was over,"</p> <p>We talked a bit more and continued talking about our respective relationships. I finally asked her why she had given up on me the past year, and what she was doing now.</p> <p>"Well, now that I think about it, we might as well get back to what our marriage is all about, don't you think?" She asked me.</p> <p>"I'm sure you have your own stories to tell," I answered her, "if someone likes to tell them."</p> <p>"Okay, maybe more of what they're saying," she said. "After the last time, it did not help one way or the other, so I'll try not to worry about that now, but you should hear from them if you change your mind, or if you're ever open to being more open about any issues.</p> <p>"One thing about my husband, he's always trying to get me off," she said. "It's not that I wouldn't like to try out a couple of guys; really. They're more like friends than lovers. He has told me many times that I should not try to have sex with a guy while he's in the same room with me. I can tell how much it bothers him, to tell me if I want to, or if we don't want it."</p> <p>She continued relating her past relationships. She had been a good, if not very kind and considerate young lady, and we were happy and in love with each other, and didn't need a lot of details to enjoy sex in that way.</p> <p>"I've had my share of sexual problems, and I understand where some of them relate, so I know more then that the others," She continued. "But I'm willing to try, but if you need to know something to help you with what you're going to be doing tonight, I understand."</p> <p>"Thank you for not mentioning something else," I said quietly, since I wanted to hear the outcome to her answer. I didn't expect the outcome exactly, but I hoped there would be some positive outcome involved, not just sexual.</p> <p>"Okay," she said, her tone of voice as light and friendly as she had always been. She started to remove the tape from her mouth and was just about to swallow when I said, "Honey, I'm only going to ask you one more time how about, just like your answers to me, how about you try something?"</p> <p>She got back to her knees and looked up. Then she started unbuckling and unbuttoning my pants.</p> <p>"Don't worry, it won't be too bad," she said, as she slowly pulled my pants off completely, leaving me standing there with an erection with nothing but my underwear on. "There can't be any real harm, it's only a couple of guys that really get off because they get to see their wives as sexy."</p> <p>She reached behind my knees, pulling on them until she had finally got them open and to my surprise, there was a condom. She smiled as she removed his pants and my briefs and looked down at herself as she did this.</p> <p>"You're just wondering if he's all that big; not that I'm complaining. Maybe even better then that. If you could get him hard, that is. You might need something though; and I'm sure you can't do that with a big thing like that."</p> <p>"It's a lot better right now; but I'm not so sure you can do anything that you don't want to and I don't," I assured her.</p> <p>Sylvia had my erection in her hands like a pro, and it couldn't have been any harder either. She stroked up and down the shaft in the palm of her hand. After a couple of minutes of this, she opened her mouth and slid that whole thing down. It was like being on a roller coaster. She had to pause before she could continue down, and before I could say anything; she did what she was doing, sliding my shaft all the way down her throat. I had to admit my wife's skill as a throat-fucker was beyond descriptionâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
