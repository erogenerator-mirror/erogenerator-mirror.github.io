I should get going then."</p> <p>She reached over and felt my cock in my pants. She got an inquisitive look on her face, she asked,</p> <p>"What happened to your pants?"</p> <p>"Well, they got caught in the river. They fell into the river, as I was working. I wasn't paying attention to it, my thoughts were elsewhere!"</p> <p>She looked up with concern, and smiled, and handed me the keys. I picked up my things and started to leave.</p> <p>"If you think your cock was in my pants, you should go right now. That is not the kind of place where a good girl needs to be caught, like a slut. And if she is good and stays good, you don't know what he could do to her and how well they would do for you."</p> <p>"Yes sir!" Her hand found its way under my suit and felt my erection, and she squeezed it softly. "I like that!" She whispered.</p> <p>When we were out of sight of the house we quickly headed back to our room. She got undressed so quickly I thought she was going to give me an early lesson in how to behave.</p> <p>"Please take off your jacket and sit on the bed." She said. "No, I do not want to be caught without your cock. It is a little embarrassing I think."</p> <p>I slowly dropped my jacket on the floor and she immediately took off her panties. We had an easy time getting naked, and when she climbed on the bed, I was surprised I didn't cum in my pants while we were doing it. She smiled and asked me to lay down, which I did, and she moved over to a chair and pulled her skirt up, then sat back down next to me. She spread her legs just a bit so that my view was clear as she began to rub herself at the edge of the bed.</p> <p>"Kitten, we can't be doing this here. It can't go any farther. You might want to sit down on the edge of the bed." She said, with a serious look.</p> <p>I hesitated. Was she seriously going to let me be in any kind of sexual situation with her? Then I realized she was naked underneath the skirt. We had been together before and I knew it was normal to touch her there. But was she serious?</p> <p>"Kitten, I do not expect you to do this here." I said.</p> <p>"Do what?" She said.</p> <p>Well, I have touched her there before, and we have even made love a couple of times. Does it look like I'm getting excited?"</p> <p>"No." She said.</p> <p>She was smiling very broadly at me again. I started to get really embarrassed and she put her hand over mine, and squeezed my hand a little more firmly,</p> <p>"It's only fair after all." She whispered. "That's why I have a lot of the first floor to myself, and you could not get too excited by seeing me. In fact, if you were in there, you could have just walked in on me."</p> <p>I was starting to get very nervous, as I had never gotten this excited in a long time. In fact, I felt pretty good when she held her arms around me, rubbing her leg up against my bare leg, giving me a good chance of being close to her if I got in front of her. She had a very firm grip around my cock, and moved her body from side to side, pressing her mound into my leg.</p> <p>"Are you sure you wouldn't rather have a little sex here, in front of you?" She said. I didn't answer. She moved her hand up from my hand, and brought it to my mouth. The feel of her hand on my body wasn't unpleasant. It felt a bit weird, but I thought about if it was right. I opened my mouth and she gently pulled on my lower lip. We both sighed in a quiet sigh, and then she moved her finger to the tip of my own cock, and pressed it a bit towards my mouth.</p> <p>"It's ok, sweetheart?" She asked, then brought her hand higher so that my lips were almost touching.</p> <p>"Yesss! Are you sure you don't mind?"</p> <p>"Absolutely!" She whispered, in a very serious looking tone. "Now, don't worry about it, you are still hard."</p> <p>For a few seconds neither of us said anything. Then her finger began to move, in little circles in my lips, and I relaxed. She kept it there for a minute or so, and then she put both hands on my chest and pressed herself firmlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
