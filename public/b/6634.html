The sun was beginning to disappear behind the clouds as the house came into view. I pulled up to the front door and watched, not wanting to ruin any of my favorite cars. It would have been a lot nicer having the windows out to help out but my car is a car, not a car.</p> <p>I started to pull out of the driveway when I heard a low, throaty voice.</p> <p>"Hello, My name is Ben." I looked up to see a man wearing the same suit that he was now wearing earlier in the week.</p> <p>"Ben. Where's Jim?" I questioned.</p> <p>"Well, he will get here, but he is still out doing his job."</p> <p>I watched as a few more of the men who had come in to hang around the house came running towards us. As I watched the men move in front of me, I saw them run around behind me and then to each of the other men. They each wrapped a large arm around me as they grabbed my shoulders and lifted me up and out of my car, placing me down on the grass.</p> <p>Ben was now standing there beside me as he handed over their weapons. Now I knew what the police officer had to do to get an arrest. I knew exactly where I had to go from here. I looked at the houses, each house was full of men. I could see a dozen of them standing around me, waiting for me to make the first move. I felt a wave of fear come over me as the fear of the next step became a panic. That fear became anger. I had to get out of here. I had to do it right now.</p> <p>"I'm so sorry. This is not how I wanted to start this adventure."</p> <p>I looked at the back of the headman.</p> <p>"But you are not. You are here and you are armed. Take your weapons away right now."</p> <p>His eyes glistened with the light of the sun as they turned to glare menacingly at me. I had never seen that in anyone before. Now I didn't even blink.</p> <p>"No. Leave us alone. Don't even try anything."</p> <p>I glanced up at the front of what used to be an old abandoned house. There were no signs of any weapons on it. It was as if there were windows that were actually boarded up so there was no need for a key. I stood there for a moment while Ben continued to talk as if nothing had happened. After a moment, I looked back down at Ben and spoke.</p> <p>"You did this, because you wanted to, right?"</p> <p>Ben was still holding my shoulders to steady me as I shook my head.</p> <p>"So, what do you think, would you do now?"</p> <p>I looked up at the house. There was still no signs of a weapon. I looked back to Ben as he spoke.</p> <p>"I would kill every one of the men. You are going to have to kill them all though. You have to watch over me and protect what I have now."</p> <p>"Oh, yes, I will." Ben then spoke. "Well, now that there is someone in my life, what would you do if there was another in your life?"</p> <p>"What would I do if there was a second?"</p> <p>Ben looked me over quickly.</p> <p>"What would you do if there was another?"</p> <p>At this point, I was having trouble breathing but I did not want to make a scene. I had to do this. I had to get out of this place.</p> <p>"I would be here with you, right? Right next door to everyone?"</p> <p>Ben looked at me, trying to see my face. I didn't know if I should respond. I didn't want to say anything so I tried to think.</p> <p>"Yes, but only with you."</p> <p>"Ben...."</p> <p>The sound of my voice had gotten to Ben as he continued talking.</p> <p>"As you can see, we are only here to do this job. We are all men. We don't care if you are here and have guns and can help us. We will not be happy if you have to stay here with us. We have to end this now before we go any farther."</p> <p>Ben then turned around to face me.</p> <p>"Look, I did not do anything wrong. All of us here have agreed to be safe for the rest of our lives."</p> <p>Hesitation and doubt was still in his voice as he spoke. He looked at me and looked me seriously in the eyes.</p> <p>"And your job doesn't depend on that. It doesn't even involve anything illegal or immoral. In fact it's not illegal at all. We do it every day for the next sevenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
