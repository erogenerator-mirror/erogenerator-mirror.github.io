"Are you sure you don't want me to suck some more, Tom?" she asked, a nervous flush creeping up her face.</p> <p>"God, yeah, baby," I answered. My own hands moved to her sides, caressed her skin, and began to slide up and down her sides. My hard-on throbbed in my pants, and my hands slid up under her top, sliding up over her big, young tits.</p> <p>I lifted my hands over her chest, pulling her top down just far enough for me to remove the shirt and then sliding back to her shoulders. I was kissing her again, now slipping my tongue in her hot mouth. I was cupping and squeezing her big tits, one hand playing with her nipples, while the other slid down her stomach and under her little skirt. My fingers found her pussy, and I slid my fingers into her. She was still very wet and hot, and I slipped a finger in. I rolled onto my back, and looked straight ahead so I could watch her.</p> <p>She spread her legs further, and I slid into her. I pushed my fingers in harder, moving them around, feeling for her g-spot. It took all of my strength to keep going, but when her hand slid up my body from behind, I couldn't help but groan. She pressed against me and I moaned out loud.</p> <p>"Mmm, yeah, baby," she murmured, as she worked a second finger into me. She pushed them in harder and I moaned and my hips started moving with her. I put a hand on her pussy lips, squeezing her gently so she would move her hips more. My cock was bulging in my sweatpants, and I could feel precum seeping out of the slit.</p> <p>Just then, she stopped moving. She looked down at me and her smile said it all. I lifted my hand, bringing two fingers back up, so I could slide them in and out, while she continued to work herself with two of my fingers. "Do you want me to stop?" she whispered, a bit nervously.</p> <p>"No," I answered, "I want to keep going. I love it." My wife reached over and took my stiff dick in her hand. I could feel the head pressing at her hand. "Can we keep going like this?" she asked.</p> <p>"Sure," I said. "I think that feels good."</p> <p>"Good. Keep stroking."</p> <p>I continued my stroking, and soon we were both moaning and working ourselves around with her fingers. She stopped long enough to take my pants and underwear off completely, with her hands on my dick. I saw my head, right near her face. Our mouths fell open, tongues intertwining, and she licked a drop of precum off the tip. She lifted her head up and lowered her lips to mine, pushing her mouth down onto mine in a lingering, open sex kiss. Then she began sliding my dick between her lips, up through her tongue, and down her throat. I felt like she was sucking cock like mine did, like she enjoyed the sensation of my dick in her mouth, and I couldn't hold back much longer.</p> <p>I felt my wife climb onto the bed and she came back towards me on her hands and knees, looking right back at me once she got into position. I was about to stand there, dick in her mouth, when she slipped my dick into her pussy. She moaned and I leaned over. My hands slid up her back, grabbed her hips and pulled them apart. I kissed her, hard, forcing my tongue into her mouth. I was fucking her hard now, with long, deep strokes. We broke the kiss with a deep gulp of breath. I was still hard, but my wife pulled her hips further away, and I heard a popping sound.</p> <p>"Doggy-style, Tom."</p> <p>"You want me to switch up?" I asked. I pulled her down and my dick slipped out of her pussy. I turned her onto her back, then slid her pants down to just above her ankles. My dick glistened with her juices, and I slid back in her.</p> <p>"Slowly, Tom. That's okay."</p> <p>"I'm not going to go that fast, am I?"</p> <p>"No, honey, you don't have to do anything. I've been dreaming about this for a while. Just let me try it."</p> <p>She rolled me back again, and I looked up at her dark brown eyes. "Fuck, baby, I'm so hot right now." I could hear her breathing, too, her body tensing. "Does this feel good?"</p> <p>"God, yes," she said, with the tone of a kitten purring. "I can see you watchingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
