I decided I should go and change before it became too late. I felt the heat of my own body on my back.</p> <p>I opened the door when I heard someone yell my name. I turned to see Lacy and the woman on the couch with me...they were both sitting on the sofa together, they seemed a little uncomfortable, but they still sat and stared at a video.</p> <p>I was about to turn around to leave when the woman at the other end of the couch yelled out I'm here to fuck you, which was all it took...she reached down and grabbed my crotch and pressed hard, as if she had done this hundreds of times before, she didn't stop me as she pulled hard and it seemed like we'd never been apart, after only the 30 seconds we'd spent just staring at the girl on the couch, she pulled her hand away and said its ok, you aren't done yet, she let go.</p> <p>I felt this was so hot, and she looked so hot, with the woman on the sofa beside her staring at the video. At that moment, I remembered how much I missed being closer to them. I grabbed the remote and the TV remote and pressed the button to switch it off.</p> <p>I smiled to myself, they would do for me right if and just so long as I told them it was ok. The woman at the other end stood up and walked over to me and sat down next to me, which I gladly obliged. The woman at the other end looked up at her and smiled, she pulled me over and kissed me deeply, a kiss I'd known so long and felt so familiar with, as it usually did with her mother. She pulled away and asked me what I was doing, and as I looked over at Lacy, I saw her eyes staring into mine as we kissed.</p> <p>I looked back to the couple on the sofa with them and then back to the woman's eyes and she leaned over and softly kissed the woman, I wondered if she could read my thoughts as our tongues connected. I saw the woman in tears, kissing back, I wondered if her mother knew what she was doing, her eyes looked from one of us to the other. When the woman leaned again to kiss me deeply and put her hand on my hand to see if it was alright, I kissed it and squeezed it.</p> <p>I felt Lacy's hand rub me from my thigh to the palm of my hand. She started to feel up my legs as our kiss continued, and as Lacy moved her hand to the waist of my shorts and felt around I started to let up so maybe the lady on the table wasn't watching the movie. I wanted to touch her though, if that was ok.</p> <p>Lacy slid one hand up my shorts to feel my balls and then she pushed it away from my body and said it's ok, I was aching to be with the lady on the table. I turned around and saw the woman on the table had her eyes glued to us as Lacy pulled my shorts down. I looked back at her as her lips wrapped around my cock and she lifted her eyes to mine.</p> <p>I got some relief as he started to go back into my thoughts, he was going to be doing this for me if I came out of my thoughts and made a move on him, and the lady on the table was clearly turned on by the idea. I felt Lacy's hands run down my legs to my boots and she pulled them off roughly. She told me to roll over onto my stomach and she pulled my shorts down. My cock was standing straight up and begging to be put back into the girl on the table.</p> <p>I felt like my cock was rock hard in front of my eyes. I turned my head back to the woman on the table as much as I could from the excitement she was giving me. I couldn't say I couldn't tell her what she was doing and she took that fact as a cue that I was to lie down, as quickly as it started.</p> <p>I was so horny, and Lacy's fingers were touching me, I thought I was going to explode by the time she started fingering me in front of Lacy who was sitting in front of us, rubbing my head. I looked at her and saw that her tongue was out licking her lips, she was rubbing her own pussy in front of us. I think she was in heat for this, and I could see she was rubbing her own tits with her hands.</p> <p>Lacy had an evil little smile on her face as she stood up. She looked at the TV and back to the couple on the couch. She pulled up my waistband of my shorts and my cock sprung free from it's confines, she pulled them and my panties off. She pulled her shirt andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
