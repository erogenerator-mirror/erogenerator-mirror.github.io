She has been through so much."</p> <p>I didn't know what to say. I didn't even know her real name. I was in shock, not knowing who she was, and why. I was confused and afraid. I just wanted to know who she was and why she had done so much. I finally said,</p> <p>"You are a good friend so nice"</p> <p>"Don't worry buddy. She has been with a lot of good people, and now that you are a friend, maybe you won't have much to worry about. You are the only friend I think of right now, and you deserve a lot of that right now."</p> <p>I walked over to her and stood in front of her. I leaned back in the seat, and put my right arm over her shoulder and put my left down to her feet. She could not see me because of her dress, but she did feel it, and knew that the heat between us was mutual. I could feel her chest rising and falling as I did. I started to lean my body away from her, not to get away, or to kiss her, but to just press myself down. She couldn't make a move, or resist, so she held herself up against me, almost in my lap. I took her hand and started to pull it on my leg, her hand slowly rubbing my semi-hard cock through my trousers. I leaned forward a bit, and placed it in her left hand and said,</p> <p>"Maybe I can get to you."</p> <p>"No, I can't. It's too risky."</p> <p>"I'll remember that" I said and we walked back to our cars.</p> <p>"Well what does this mean, if one of us doesn't mind"</p> <p>"We still haven't really talked, and it might not be very safe for you" I said.</p> <p>"She wouldn't mind. She is a nice person. Besides, she would be a good friend." She looked at me and replied,</p> <p>"If that's the case, I think I understand."</p> <p>I didn't know what to say. I didn't know how to ask. When we returned to the area of the town, I asked her where she lived. She said it was near the edge of town, and she didn't know anyone. I just told her I live in town in a suburb. I told her I'm a professor in a junior college, but I'm not much of a student. I didn't see much reason to come and visit her. I'm kind of like a student, and I like to get to know her before I have a relationship with her. Her apartment is three blocks up that way. I asked her for her address, and she told me that she lived in a different neighborhood, in two houses from where she lived alone. We started walking back towards her apartment, again, I didn't feel awkward walking with her. However, we got to her apartment building and I pulled her inside.</p> <p>"Take off all your clothes in the bedroom, and lay down on the bed. Take off your shoes and socks."</p> <p>I told her that I had thought about it, and that I'd never have the nerve to do that. I wanted to ask her something personal, but I couldn't think of the right words, so I just looked at her. She was wearing my shirt, which she said was unbuttoned more than a button down. In the dim light of the bedroom I could see that her breasts would be exposed, and I could see her nipple poking through the shirt. She just stared at me for a moment. Then, she put her hands on her breasts and started to stroke them. She slowly leaned in towards me and we kissed, softly, very softly. She pulled back a bit, then smiled, stood up, then went back into the bedroom. I was so surprised that I came right there, too embarrassed to move and just go back to the bedroom where I was, but that's how I felt. My head was spinning, and I couldn't think of anything to say. I just wanted to put her into bed, and leave her. She turned back towards me, and I could now see her lips and see that she was grinning in that sexy, sexy smile. It was one of those smiles that I had dreamed of seeing and I wanted to see what it felt like. She didn't say anything but she reached out and held me close to her.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I just couldn't leave you like this. I wanted to make sure that was okay. I didn't want you to feel that you had to go."</p> <p>I told her that that wasn't okay. I was worried that I was going to lose her, and I wanted her to be safe just so that I could protect her from those peopleâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
