She gasped at the sight, but didn't say a word in response. I opened it, took the key and unlocked the top third. I took off my shirt and stepped out of my pants, leaving only my boxers to my ankles. As soon as they were off I put my legs through hers, and they locked. I pulled my boxers down and my dick was already pointing up, but I let her feel that too, as she gripped her ankles and let me take the keys. This time, I took my time making the lock. Then I turned to her and we stood there, together, and locked the door behind us. I walked away, and I could see the expression in her face as she looked out of her bedroom windows, at the pool, at the trees. I went to my room, and, like before, I turned on the light, but this time, in her room, the room and everything she had always dreamed about was about to happen.</p> <p>I found the key and we stepped out, but the whole time she held that position, waiting for me to unlock her. I didn't waste anytime. I led her inside as I unlocked the door and stepped back out. She smiled and let go of her ankles, again. I held her and led her to her dresser, and I sat down and unlocked it. The sight she made me go as she bent over, taking in her shoes and socks, her arms crossed, all the way down to her ankles. She looked back at me, still bent over, and locked the door, all the way. Then she straightened up, looking at me, and said, "So what do we do now?"</p> <p>"I said, "so now," and I got undressed, still watching her, but my dick was hard already. She grinned and said, "Oh, I'm looking forward to tonight." We moved to her bed, and it was a lot better looking than I thought it should be. It was made from black leather and had black, thick, velvety curtains covering it so that it looked like a dream-come-true. As soon as we were in the bed, I had her get on all fours. I walked behind her and felt her up as we watched the TV, so I had to rub her butt, which turned my dick into even more of a tent. Then she turned her head back and I put a finger in her. This time, she let me feel the tip of my dick, and she looked back at me, and my dick, and she smiled. Then I took my finger out of her, and told her to turn around, bend over, and keep her legs open so I could get a good look at her wet pussy. She did as she was told, and I reached and felt her pussy, and it was a lot tighter than her house was. I kept my finger in her, feeling her body move on my finger. I took my hand out and told her to stand up. Then I stood up and walked to the nightstand, where I took out a little bottle of lube and some panties for my dick.</p> <p>She took the panties, and put the panties on. "Would you like to try this," I asked.</p> <p>"Oh yes," she said, and put her arms through the straps of her bra, and opened it up. Then she was sitting down, and I knelt down to take off her panties. Then I moved back to her and kissed her neck, and I kissed her nipples, and she leaned her head back, and I put a hand on her pussy, and she spread, so I could feel all her wetness, as I kissed around her breasts, and her nipples grew even more so, so that I could almost touch her between her legs, and she was so wet I knew I had to stop.</p> <p>"No, no," she said, "You can't do that, it makes her look too much, and you think I'm so much more attractive. I can do it as long as I don't bend over."</p> <p>I didn't really know how she meant that, but I did know I could be a bitch if I put a foot wrong. Anyway, the next time we made love, I told her to strip, and I went into her room to do the same. Then I went back to her room and opened her door. She had a red ribbon tied around her waist, that had a bow in it, I saw, on the bed. I sat on the edge of the bed and pulled it out carefully, and put a hand on her stomachâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
