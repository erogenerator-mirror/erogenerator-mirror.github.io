I said laughing.</p> <p>"Look she didn't have a choice with you. She wasn't even in the mood."</p> <p>"I know."</p> <p>"What kind of thing?"</p> <p>"I don't think it made any difference to her."</p> <p>"I wish she was the only one!" We both laughed.</p> <p>We started to get dressed again and then she said, "Do you think they'll go out there, for me to have sex with? I love sex with men. I just like it and no one will ever hurt me."</p> <p>"I think they'll find someone else. Just the other way around..."</p> <p>"Yeah... I guess."</p> <p>We both finished dressing and then she grabbed my hand and headed towards the door. "Where are we going?"</p> <p>"I don't know. I got someplace to go tonight."</p> <p>"We should go to dinner." She stopped in front of the door and looked at me. "We don't have to go right now, or ever. We have time. I want to spend some time with you." She held our hand and as she walked towards the door she kissed it and I knew then that she had something planned. I went to meet her and she had the biggest grin and we walked out to her car. As we approached her car her eyes seemed to be focused on my chest and we both knew then that we were in for a very special night. We drove away not saying a word and then I pulled in at a small town. She opened the door for me and we got out of the car and walked towards the door. As we approached the door I was able to place her up against the door and as she put her arms around me I gently kissed her neck. I could feel her breathing becoming heavier as I kissed her neck and she pulled me tighter against her. She let out a deep breath and then slowly let it out.</p> <p>She broke our embrace and walked back to her car, pulling the door open. As she started driving away I looked over at her and then I went back to her and laid her back against the door. I unzipped her jacket and she took it off and tossed it on the back seat, then grabbed my shirt and pulled me to her and we kissed. She held my back against her so I didn't have to move to keep kissing her. She then broke the kiss and then took my shirt off and tossed it next to her jacket. I grabbed her and kissed her again then slipped my hand down her skirt and started to finger her. I could taste the perfume on her lips from earlier and from the feel of her hands in my hair. We broke our kiss and she pulled me to her where I put her down on her stomach. She reached over her shoulder and pulled her skirt down and I put on my pants and they went down too. Before she had time to say goodnight I turned her over and started licking her pussy again. Her breathing was heavier now as she started to moan and push her hips into my mouth.</p> <p>"Are you going to fuck me?" she asked in a little kid voice.</p> <p>"Yes, but first we need to clean up first to get out of here." I said as I turned her and put her back against the ground.</p> <p>When we got down there I took of my shirt and then started to remove my pants. She was looking at a little black vibrator but I wasn't sure how to put it. I moved down her body and kissed my way to my pants and started to rub the vibrator on the outside of her wet pussy. She was moaning and pushing back against me. When I stopped kissing her she had her eyes closed as she pushed her hips back at me. I licked her pussy for a second then pulled away. I looked at her and just had the craziest desire to fuck her and do it hard, but then I didn't and I knew I had to stop it.</p> <p>It wasn't long before I had my own orgasm. That was enough, I didn't want to wait. I moved to her mouth and we kissed and then I pulled her to the sofa bed and had her lay down in the center of the bed. While I looked at her I pulled her skirt up just below her pussy and slowly started to kiss her lips. I stuck my tongue in her mouth and then slid it slowly down to her clit. She started to moan in frustration and I kept licking and sucking till I tasted her juices. I pulled away and stood, then I pulled her up onto her knees and entered her from behind. It was such pleasure. She never said 'fuck' but she was really starting. I pulled out then I did slow then I entered her again. I didn't want to wait. I pulled out, kissed her and then thrust into her again. I didn'tâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
