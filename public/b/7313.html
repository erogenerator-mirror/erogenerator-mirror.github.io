Please may we please go?"</p> <p>In my bedroom I unzip my dress and slowly take it from over my head, then let it fall to the floor. I step out of it, naked from waist up. My nipples ache to be touched and to be touched and I find myself almost wishing it would not be so.</p> <p>I take your hand and lead you down the hall to my bedroom. On the bed, naked as always you lay and I join you. We make love one last time before collapsing onto the bed again, this time spooning while we fall asleep.</p> <p>I am awoken at the sound of your cell phone ringing. I reach over and pull the end of the bed sheet down to cover us and start to rub your stomach feeling your pussy quiver as I do. I can hear you breathing in my ear as I can and it is making me so turned on. As I rub your thighs gently I can feel you tense and your body tremble. I move my fingers just slightly to feel your desire and to be able to please you without moving my hand any closer. I start to kiss your neck and ear as I continue to massage your breasts.</p> <p>My mouth moves down to where my fingers begin rubbing your pussy and slowly start inserting one finger as I continue to kiss your neck. You can feel my tongue caressing your neck and ear making you shudder as the passion begins to build inside. My mouth moves down to your shoulders kissing you softly before moving down to kiss your breasts before continuing lower. As I move my mouth my hand moves over your pussy, spreading your lips apart as I continue to lick your clit. As my tongue moves over your clit your hand moves back to your nipples, making them harder and your whole body quiver and I feel your hips move ever so slightly.</p> <p>As my tongue makes it's way back up to your pussy you start grinding yourself onto my tongue, I can feel your juices running down over my tongue as you move back down now kissing your way to my ear lobe. I can here you moan softly as you feel that I will be able to bring you off with just my tongue and lips but not your fingers.</p> <p>Your fingers move slowly down your body rubbing the outside of your pussy before moving a finger to rub around your entrance, slowly pushing it into you as I feel you begin to shudder with your impending orgasm. I can feel your body stiffen and your breasts thrust up as your nipple is sucked and bitten on. You cum hard against my mouth, your body shaking beneath me, as your muscles contract as the orgasm continues. You look me in the eyes as I continue to lick your clit slowly until you relax. It takes me a few moments to realise that the tears are no longer in your eyes because your eyes are so wet with your orgasm.</p> <p>You are still panting and I can tell you are still cumming but as your body relaxes I lick your juices off your fingers licking them clean. Your fingers slip from inside me as I look up at you, smiling I whisper, "I need you" as I move my fingers to the head of your mound making you wince.</p> <p>With your legs still spread wide open my tongue slips back into your pussy as my fingers slide into you and start to fuck you again. Our bodies begin to respond again as the passion builds again. I don't even have to move now, the excitement of your juices is making me sooo impatient. I move down slowly and kiss you as you feel the bed moving. I turn you over so that your back is to me and start to lick your tits again. As I move to kiss you as I can get the tip of my tongue over your nipple I move back up to kiss you as our tongues meet. My hand moves over your belly, down between your legs and slowly starts to massage your clitoris as my tongue continues to tease your nipples. My hand moves down to your thigh as I start to massage your mound and then to rub down the inside of your thigh and rub slowly down. Your legs spread open as my hand moves down to your thigh as I pull on your thigh as my fingers move up to your vagina.</p> <p>My hand moves slowly in circles over your cunt as my fingers touch your lips. You can feel them wet as they gently slide over you lips and you start moving yourself on them. My hand moves up to the tip of you as I push a finger inside you. As my finger enters you I move it back and stroke slowly over you clit. It feels so good as you start to shiver again. My hands move to your breasts and start to massage them gently as my tongue makes one last pass over your clit as my fingers slide around your love hole. I feel your body twitch then quiver as I continue my fingers. Then I move between your legs and lower myself back onto your pussy. You feel my weight moving down asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
