I turned my body towards him to meet his and as we kissed it was like we were two different people, one who was kissing deeply and wanting more.</p> <p>I broke away from our kiss and pulled him into the car and into the passenger seat.</p> <p>When he followed in behind me I was just wearing my blouse and skirt, my bra and panties, as was his favourite. He was wearing shorts, not just my jeans and he quickly undid them.</p> <p>His hand came to cup my breast from behind and his mouth descended on my neck for a short kiss and then his hand was gone.</p> <p>We drove off to the club, a nice pub we had just picked up just over a mile away. It was a little before eight and there were more people playing cards in the room, drinking beer and watching the dancers but the place seemed empty.</p> <p>We arrived at the dance floor with me in his arms and he led me to the back of the first set of tables and had me sit on a table next to the stage. He took my coat off, leaving me standing in bra and panties which he then pulled off over my head.</p> <p>My breasts were slightly sagging as I had not worn a bra that night and as I had just had a long hot shower I was feeling a little exposed. But the next few sets of the other guests didn't show any sign of caring as they watched the dancers and danced and, after the last set, took their seats.</p> <p>I didn't mind being naked in this room. I enjoyed being able to have a free show but still had to have some clothes on. I was happy at the thought of someone seeing me in my underwear and when I had been given a little push I was sitting with only the bra on under my dress.</p> <p>There were about a dozen of them in the room but I still felt a little exposed for now. There were lots more people in the room and I was sure that most of them would be naked too.</p> <p>There were some girls dancing either in a bra on or without, some in their panties on and I did notice a pair of young ladies standing between the couples as they did a few dance moves.</p> <p>This was the sort of show I was sure should have helped me with my plan of getting naked. There were several older guys there too and at first they would have given a great hard-on to my naked body, but when a girl or a woman moved to a dance or did a strip tease they turned the whole show into a big tête-à-tête.</p> <p>I did not know many of the other patrons so was glad to have more people in my area of life but I didn't care as long as they wanted sex from me, just as long as they wanted to fuck my brains out.</p> <p>The show started to get more and more passionate until the girl on her way through the crowd took off her bra and, with her arm over her body, put her breast on my mouth and said: "Fuck her, she wants you to fuck her."</p> <p>Then the girl in bra had pushed her panties off and she had slid on a condom covered in some sort of blue jelly and, before I could do more than kiss her, she had pushed her mouth over mine and was sucking my mouth. There was just less than half of another girl in the room now watching the lesbian action she was trying to get into my mind and I had got hard again in just seconds.</p> <p>I pushed back on her and she said, "Do it, let's do it right."</p> <p>I felt the other guy there at the table move around and I looked round to see him taking her breasts, the first one, for a kiss and then I felt some moves around me and something else. I was sure that it was the condom, I was sure of it in front of me and I felt it sliding between my legs as he held her body.</p> <p>I tried to move from that direction so I could move away from her but that just seemed to make it more of a turn-on. As I got more worked up I felt his hand on my leg, it was just an arm but it felt like a hand but I didn't care.</p> <p>The hand felt like a hand as he moved up my leg and then I thought I was in trouble because she had a mouth on mine too. I thought he was going to enter me but then I felt something at the opening of my vagina and it didn't stop then.</p> <p>There we were in a room with four other women and five of the guys, all naked. I didn't think I would be able to see anything but all four of them were looking at my naked body and all of them seemed to be smiling. I knew there were many times they would be looking at my vagina, not just my body but my body—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
