As soon as we got back to his place, we went into the bedroom and I told him I'd be back in an hour or so for dinner. We both laughed and when I got all of the dishes out of the washing machine, I put everything away and went out to make dinner.</p> <p>When I came back into the bedroom, he was sitting at the kitchen table. I went to sit next to him but he stopped me.</p> <p>"Where do you want to start? I'll set the plates on the table, so you can finish dinner."</p> <p>"On the way to bed, I could start on the salad."</p> <p>"Okay. Here we go."</p> <p>We got into the kitchen in the nude and he set each plate on top of another. As soon as he had the last plate covered with two forks of salad, he said, "I've had enough for today. I really love this food."</p> <p>"You mean it's even better in bed? How much is this extra dessert?"</p> <p>He smiled, and said, "No, silly, it's extra. I'm sorry. I'll take care of it." He got up and got into bed. With me sitting there watching, I took his hand and told him to do the same with the plates. I laid the salad down and went back into the living room to help him finish. The next few minutes had everything on a plate and we began with the salad. We had a good laugh about how ridiculous the whole thing was. He took a bite of the salad as well. We were both smiling when he finished a second bite.</p> <p>"I'm sorry about last night. It may have been a bit of a shock. It was great watching you and feeling your excitement. It always helps you get aroused. Maybe I didn't do it right. Maybe I wasn't thinking. That's it."</p> <p>"You did wonderful for me. Now the main course."</p> <p>"Okay, here's the chicken and eggs. I'm sure they're just as delicious looking as they are without the main course.</p> <p>That's a new one for me. I can't get over how good it is to have so much food. I feel like I have to stop eating to savor it."</p> <p>"If you don't want me to stop, I wouldn't blame you. I'm not sure where it's going, but I love it even more now. Now we both can enjoy each other. I just can't get enough of the food. Just like I can't get enough of the wonderful food, if you have any questions."</p> <p>As I set the last plate in front of him, I began to move our forks around trying to make a salad that I hadn't done in years. I didn't know how much food I was making. I thought it would start to slow down with the chicken but I still had about 15 minutes to get him ready to eat. While I waited for my son, I decided to make a quick dinner. When I came back to the living room with a couple of forks in hand, he had put them on the table.</p> <p>"Would you like me to set the table?"</p> <p>I didn't hesitate and got to work on top of the chicken and eggs. I didn't know how to cook but I did it with relative ease. I told him that it was no problem, because he should be able to do it and eat without some problems. After my meal, I cleaned up and went back to the kitchen to finish dinner. I could hear him and he had been talking a lot when I walked in. When I got back into the living room, he turned and looked at me and as I walked into the room, he stopped and put his arms around me. I knew he loved the feeling of my naked body pressing against his.</p> <p>"I had no idea my son could cook and he didn't know how to. It was like he was a fish out of water."</p> <p>"I'm glad he didn't know how to cook." I was surprised about the compliment. I guess he didn't cook in college on account of what this was like.</p> <p>After dinner was done, we sat in the living room drinking wine. I could see that his eyes were closed and he had been watching me. The next step after dinner was to do the same thing we had done on the table. We had dinner in the living room. When we came back into the living room, he had already fallen back asleep. I took his hand and sat down next to him and as soon as I sat down, we were naked on the couch. I was going to finish up my job when we both heard him say he had to go to the bathroom.</p> <p>"Well, what did you think of our new plan," I asked?</p> <p>"I think I likedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
