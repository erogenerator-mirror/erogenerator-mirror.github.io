It took a moment for her feet to move on their own, but then their hands were once again at her ankles, helping to spread her legs just a little.</p> <p>“You are so gorgeous” he said as he held her from behind and lifted her legs up toward him.</p> <p>“I’m not a good dancer even when I need to be in my own world.” She laughed as she was finally able to move her hips a little.</p> <p>“I’m sorry for the disappointment that occurred to you?” He said in a soft voice.</p> <p>“No, that’s the whole thing. You just never see it when you are being looked at by people. But now that we have made love, I feel like I should be on stage.” She said with a little pout on her face.</p> <p>“If you are nervous, I would understand but you looked so beautiful, it was only right that you should be on stage.” he said as moved her head up and kissed her on the lips, just as a woman would kiss her husband. He slowly slid her legs apart as he continued to kiss and nibble her lips with his mouth. He placed his hand on her breast and started to tweak her nipple a little. He smiled as he watched her breast start to rise and fall with her breathing. He placed one leg up on the couch to let her have access to it, and she gladly took her hand off of his chest and took his hand.</p> <p>“Touch me like I touch you.” She said as she put her legs up on the couch in front of him.</p> <p>He looked down to watch her slowly work her hand down his chest toward his now fully erect nine-inch cock. “I can’t even begin to imagine how my body is reacting to the touch of another person.” He said as they began to kiss again. “It felt so nice to be with you again.” He said between kisses. “I hope that I will be able to last a long time like that after you,” he said as he started to kiss her neck.</p> <p>She looked at him and was amazed with the fact that all of these feelings were coming from her eyes. “I love you.” She said in a tone that was quite innocent.</p> <p>“I love you too,” he said with a sly smile.</p> <p>She looked down to see that his cock was fully hard again, and very large. “I just want to feel close to you again.” She said in a husky voice.</p> <p>”I was hoping you would.” He said back in his deep voice.</p> <p>“I just want us to go for awhile and that will give us time to get to know one another,” she said as she put her hand over his and put hers on his hard cock, stroking it a little.</p> <p>“It’s getting so late. You don’t have to leave now if you want to. That is the good part.” He said as they kissed once again.</p> <p>“That is the perfect moment; I feel like we are finally being happy again.” She said as she wrapped her arms around his neck and started to kiss him again.</p> <p>“So, how long was I a virgin?” He asked as he kissed her again.</p> <p>“I was twelve when I started and it got harder with time.” Her eyes closed once again as she smiled to herself.</p> <p>“It’s my first time with a man.” He said back. “But I can’t wait to be there to be your first.” He said as he looked down to see if he could see where their kisses were leading.</p> <p>“I felt like I—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
