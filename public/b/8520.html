Her lips were softer than her lips, and it was very sweet. I kissed her face, licked her ears, sucked on her ears and earslobes until I had to taste her. I got the hang of it fast and was able to get her up and hold her close, our bodies pressing together and her breasts rubbing against mine. Finally we stopped kissing and she moved, moving one of her hands down to my waist and then moving it around to my backside, "What a way to start this evening!" she exclaimed. "I guess the last few months have been exhausting." She turned into me, pressing her firm breast against me and began to kiss me again.</p> <p>I took the lead and moved the one leg over hers to allow the other leg to lay down near her. I felt her soft, flat stomach with my hand and started to feel the outline of her breasts through the thin material of her shirt. I traced her breasts with my fingers and then pinched her nipples, rolling them between my fingers as she groaned and moved her hips against me. I moved my hand up to her belly then rubbed lightly up along her arms. My finger circled her navel, then moved down across the top of the shirt, to the waist band of her shorts, and up under her belt to the small of her back that was pushed away from the top of the dress. I rubbed her bare back and her skin felt so smooth. I moved my fingers around inside her shorts, and down along the sides of her hips and down to the bottom of her jeans, pushing against her cheeks. Just as I got to her shorts the zipper began to open and my hand moved inside.</p> <p>It didn't take long and I felt the heat coming from her pussy. I found myself getting a strong hard on and was a little worried that maybe she was having an orgasm. I was a lucky man to have some of the most beautiful women that I could ever dream of, but I also knew that I wanted to take this time to savor every minute. As soon as my hand got a hand on my cock I knew I wouldn't be able to take much more. She smiled and looked pleased to have pleased me. I moved back in the center of the bed so she could lay down on her back and I quickly undid my pants, letting them fall to the floor. I sat down on the bed next to her, took a handkerchief from my pocket, and started to wet my fingers.</p> <p>"You are the most sensual woman I have ever met. Here, smell this." I said as I took the wet handkerchief from her hand and smelled it. "You like it, huh?" I asked. She made a soft sound that was very sexy. I moved forward between her legs, and knelt down on the bed between her knees. I put my face at her cunt, and touched her lightly as I sucked on her lips. She closed her eyes and lifted her hips as I pressed my face into her, getting another soft moan from her and began to grind against my face. I sucked harder and started to lick her outer lips, feeling her respond as I flicked my tongue around her pink orifice, enjoying the taste of her.</p> <p>I moved my tongue up and down under her labia; my mouth pressing into her so she could feel the tip of my long tongue as more of a tease to her. Then I licked the middle of her slit, tasting the saltiness of her juices in my mouth. I was amazed that her pussy was so clean and taste as clean as it was from my mouth. I had found a woman that had a good amount of hair there. When I flicked my tongue against the top of her opening, I could feel the walls of her flesh expand and her lips stretch as my tongue touched them.</p> <p>This was wonderful! I was doing things that I had never done before and was feeling very much like I wanted to try. My penis responded to the touch and my mouth, and I could feel the little ridges along my upper lip as it rubbed against it. I was about to move a finger inside her when my tongue touched the very tip of her pussy. I slowly stroked it, then probed her slowly as I continued to lick her. I had to use both hands to part her lips so I could get my whole tongue inside her. She was so wet, I could see some of the moisture on the tip of my tongue.</p> <p>I moved my mouth up to where my tongue could reach better. I flicked my tongue up and down, teasing her with my touch, then moved my tongue back down under the folds of her pussy, getting most of the juice now running down there. I flicked my tongue aroundâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
