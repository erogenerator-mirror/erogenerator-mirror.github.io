Her breathing was fast now and she was panting now. He reached between her legs, his fingers sliding into her hot wet hole, his body pressing onto hers as she bucked and writhed before him. Then he stopped and she cried out in pain. She saw his body tense and jerk. Her heart pounded in her chest. She moaned and moaned. "Please, please. It's too good." Her cries were loud and desperate. "No!" she cried. "Please stop."</p> <p>He continued pressing inside her. He kept it steady for a moment, holding himself inside of her. His cock felt enormous against her, but she knew what she wanted even if it was just an occasional touch.</p> <p>"That's better, darling, my body is moving towards a climax now," he whispered in her ear in a voice that was husky with lust.</p> <p>She knew she wanted to scream, but couldn't. "Please, don't!" she heard herself saying out loud in fear. "It hurts, it's too good." She moaned again, trying to get to him even if her voice was weak and she couldn't see what she wanted, "Please," and she begged. "Don't stop, please don't. I can feel myself coming now," and she felt a thrill at the words.</p> <p>He chuckled against her ear and then she felt him withdraw from her.</p> <p>"Your body is limp now, darling. But we have a special game we like to play. It's called 'the little cunt.' It's what most of your people call a 'breast.' You don't hear those words often, but every once in a while, they're used to say the words I want you to use. It's called 'whore' because I'm going to fuck you silly."</p> <p>He kissed her and she could feel the touch of his tongue against her sensitive skin. She knew he knew that she wanted him. She wanted him inside of her, making love to her body. "I never fuck anyone until after the game," she heard herself say. "I know I'm not your toy to play with, but you have to use your mouth, your tongue, your body. You have to use your hands to do whatever you want. You have no time to play around anymore. You have to make love to me."</p> <p>He smiled against her cheek. Her body seemed to be tingling under his touch and it was becoming hard to think but it was his control over her that made her want to think it. With a smile he pulled her body up to him, his hands sliding over her breasts again, squeezing them gently and causing her nipples to tighten against her shirt. He kissed around her neck and shoulders, her shoulders and her hair. "So good. So good," he muttered into her hair. "You are a lovely girl, so sweet and so responsive."</p> <p>She was not sure if he knew it at that moment or if it was just one of his jokes. "You make me feel nice," she whispered. She felt her body tense. Her legs trembled as her body felt his hot touch run along her skin and down her hips. She could feel his penis pressing against her and she could no longer take her eyes off of him and it made her want to go and kiss him again, to open her legs and let him in, and to make him fuck her.</p> <p>She felt his body on her like an electric current. His hands moved to her hips and he slowly lowered her toward him. She felt his erection as it touched against her body and then slowly slid down against her as she felt him press against her. She felt a moan escape her lips. "I never knew it could feel so good." she whimpered. "I never knew it could be this good."</p> <p>His hands caressed her. "Tell me what you feel," he whispered against her ear. "Tell me what you want to do to me."</p> <p>She felt another orgasm on her as her body shuddered and she felt his tongue run over her ear. "I want you to fuck me. I want you to fuck me like the little whore that you are."</p> <p>His body went rigid on top of hers as he pressed himself against her, feeling her body against his. There wasn't anything she could do to please him just yet, but she didn't care what he did to her, how he made her feel and she felt it all for the first time in her life.</p> <p>With a groan, he sank his length inside of her pussy as his hardness thrust and rammed inside of her. "I love you like this." Her body felt like it was being pushed up into a wall. "It's what I wanted from you, my beautiful little slut.
