Why don't you come up and sit down with me." I put my arm around her and she took me by the hand and we moved our bodies around until we were sitting on the grass facing each other. "I've always liked doing that. Sometimes it gets a little...dirty. Not that I mind. But sometimes we just talk about it. Is this good?"</p> <p>"Oh yes. This is great." She pulled her legs up and put them in mine and I put my arms around them and we held on to each other. This was perfect. We moved our hands in concert with our breaths and when we had to use the rest of our bodies to hold back what was on our mind.</p> <p>"There is a nice little pond in the woods and that's where we'll be spending the next few hours. There are all kinds of animals. I got some water for the pond and a cooler so we can make a quick visit." I turned her around to face me and she placed her head in my lap. "Do you think we could find some more grass and some more rocks?" I asked.</p> <p>"Sure," she replied. Then, she lay on her back looking up at me with a big smile and a twinkle in her eye. "What's your pleasure?" she asked.</p> <p>"Come on up and sit on my lap if you want," I was happy to let her know that. She got down on her hands and knees and came up to me and my arms went around her chest, hugging her and feeling her softness. "I love this. It's so peaceful, isn't it?" She nodded her head and I placed mine on her back, which she pressed into my chest and I held her there, my hands sliding up her back to her shoulders, down her sides, and then all the way down her hips.</p> <p>"You know, here," she touched my crotch and I gasped. "I don't know any guys but do I have to tell you just about how many guys have been in my pussy?" I nodded and she leaned down and kissed my belly button. "But you'll have to ask me to do the same for you." She smiled and started to kiss all around my belly, stopping to kiss my cock through my shorts.</p> <p>"Are you sure...no, I'll be honest here," she said and she slid her open mouth over my cock head, licking me, looking up at me with those big dark brown eyes that you know make mine go wild. At the same time she grabbed the back of her throat, and in all my years of playing with girls, I always had trouble keeping them in. Her lips made me shudder. She took me and slid her mouth to the base of my cock then began to bob up and down, the sound of her sucking, slurping and humming filling the small pond.</p> <p>She took me back into her mouth now so that all my cock head was in her mouth and she sucked hard as if trying to make me cum. My hands were on her head and I pressed it against me as if to make her choke, then I pulled back. "Ah, ah, hold it inside," I was just about to say stop, when she took me out of her mouth and kissed my glistening cockhead and then opened her mouth again. "I'm going to do this, aren't I?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes, you are. It is going to get more fun each time."</p> <p>"I love the control I feel when I'm getting in and out of your mouth," she said. She put her hands on her tits, pinching her nipples, pulling them and I couldn't take it anymore. "If you do it right, I don't know if I could cum," I said. She took me in again.</p> <p>"Not as quick as yesterday," she said. "After I took your entire cock into my mouth, I didn't have to do anything." She sat up and looked at me and she had tears in her eyes. "I didn't do anything."</p> <p>"Didn't do nothing." I said, feeling that I should know her better than I knew she. And then I added, "What do you say? If you want to keep this up...then yes. We need to know if our sex life has improved."</p> <p>"I know. I feel horrible about something we shared yesterday," she said as she got up on the grass.</p> <p>"I know, but we can live with that."</p> <p>"Do you...think we should...do this?"</p> <p>"Yes. If we want to."</p> <p>"Oh, I don't know. Do you want to?"</p> <p>"Noâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
