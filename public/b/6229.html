"I've got plans, I'm getting dressed."</p> <p>"I'm taking you to take a shower tonight, or something," she offered, blushing, "it's up to you."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, Miss," he said with a soft smile, "that's not necessary." He leaned forward, placing his hands on her hips and slowly sliding the thong down her legs. "I'm just going to take you to bed, that's all."</p> <p>He sat on the couch and patted the cushion behind him, "Sit down, you're next to my leg."</p> <p>She sat, slowly, staring into his hazel eyes. She was embarrassed to be watching him, but she knew that she had had too much to drink and she couldn't help herself. She felt his hand slide slowly up her thigh, then stop at her panties.</p> <p>Suddenly he pulled aside her panties.</p> <p>"No!" she exclaimed, suddenly shy, then realized he already had his hand in her panties. "I don't want to bother you again." She didn't know what to say, so she continued to stare at his eyes.</p> <p>When his fingers found the elastic band there and pulled it away, she saw her moisture glistening on her smooth lips. He pulled her panties down and pulled her legs apart.</p> <p>"No, please don't," she pleaded, afraid to get caught.</p> <p>"I think I have an idea," he said and pulled her panties away as he knelt in front of her. "There is no shame here," he said, "this is your first time, and it's something that you will not like."</p> <p>"What is it?"</p> <p>"Will you kiss me there?"</p> <p>"Yes," she whispered, and he stood, sliding her panties off. She felt awkward, but instead of making a big deal out of it, she let his lips cover hers. He softly kissed her lips and then pressed the tip of his tongue into the hot, wet depths of her mouth. She sucked his tongue tightly, moaning as she felt that same tongue slide along her wet, sticky slit. He kissed her all up and down as he slowly pushed his tongue into her mouth, tasting the soft, hot skin of her throat. "I'm your first," he murmured into her dark hair, pulling her down onto his lips, forcing their tongues into an embrace that felt as if it were hours.</p> <p>She felt as if a hot fire had been released on her legs, and she began to feel tingles in her lower abdomen.</p> <p>He slid one hand up under her bra as she kissed him. She felt him pull her back, then she felt him sliding it higher up her sides, exposing the smooth mounds of her breasts. Her nipples stood fully erect, straining against her bra and blouse as he ran his hand up and down the firm curves. She was breathing rapidly to the rhythm of his finger sliding along the wet groove on her vagina. She moaned, thrusting her hips at him as he took his finger from her hot and glistening pink lips, and slid it inside her, feeling the smooth walls of her slick tunnel clenching on his intruding finger. He pushed it deeper; deeper still, making her whimper as his long finger explored the depths of her core.</p> <p>He leaned up, kissing her passionately, lifting his hips as he positioned himself between her legs. Her breasts swayed, as his cock pressed against her. She knew he was ready, and she moved herself to him as he slid inside. He grasped her arms and pulled her down on the rug as he sank into her. They kissed as they made love, and she felt herself becoming aroused as she wrapped her legs around his waist, feeling his length sliding into her. She gasped, biting her lip as he continued to kiss her.</p> <p>"I love you, Miss," he said into her ear.</p> <p>"I love you, too, honey," she answered back, pulling him toward her with her hands as he slid over her lips to her mouth.</p> <p>They kissed again, long and lingering, and as his penis slid fully inside her, she broke off their kiss only to kiss him back as she felt him fill her.</p> <p>Her arms locked onto his shoulders as his mouth sucked at her tongue, and she could feel herself building to an orgasm. She was sure that she could have stood up any moment, but she knew she needed to keep her composure. She began to move with him, as if they were meant to be. They both made sounds and moans together as his cock began to fuck her again.</p> <p>He stopped kissing her. She sat on him, grinding her hips against his as he began to move inside her.
