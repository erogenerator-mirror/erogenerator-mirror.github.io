"Let's go." We hurriedly walked outside.</p> <p>I made us coffee or tea or whatever, and then we both sat in the living room. I lit the fire, and we both sat and stared into each others eyes. My thoughts were filled and I thought to myself, "That's it for today, she'll be off to college in 3 weeks. I guess I'll just have to give her a break."</p> <p>"So you'll meet with her, when she finally comes?" The smile on her face and the eyes she smiled at all the questions she was asking made me wonder. I could never tell her all that had to do with sex. I wasn't sure if I could just ignore such a situation, but the look I saw in her eyes when I was getting my answer, it was a pretty intense, all-consuming expression to her.</p> <p>"Oh I think so, she'll finally be free." I replied. She just gave that big smile again.</p> <p>"Great!" she said excitedly. "That's great too!"</p> <p>I smiled to myself as we sat there and tried to understand her reasoning behind her last comment. I don't know what came over me, but I knew I finally got my answer.</p> <p>We both laughed and hugged. In that moment, I still couldn't quite believe she actually said "that is great." But I know it had a big effect on her, and she knew her place.</p> <p>"So how was the rest of the day?" she asked.</p> <p>"Great. Now you know what you're getting in for when you get back home...,"</p> <p>"Oh I think that was just our second date..." she said hesitantly.</p> <p>"Uh right," I replied knowingly. All I had to do was just give her a little more time.</p> <p>"Well there's not so much to lose..." she whispered in reply.</p> <p>"Oh that's right," I said, smiling and kissing her softly. "We'll see then... for sure."</p> <p>We walked together back to her house just as she unlocked it. We were both so excited though, I didn't want anything to break the mood and make us all nervous. I had to know how it would look, with us living together, for three whole weeks.</p> <p>"Here we go..." I said.</p> <p>We both giggled inside as we walked into her house. The lights were still on as she led the way into the kitchen. As we got closer to the living room, she reached out and pulled me into her and embraced me as I kissed her deeply. We kissed for so long and passionately and as it was, she could hardly keep her hands off of me. I could feel my heart beating even faster as we did so. We kissed for so long, our tongues entwining. Our bodies fit together perfectly as we felt that familiar excitement coming from the heat of our bodies. I felt her legs and then her hands and then her soft, warm flesh.</p> <p>We finally pulled away, but it was clear we were both lost in a haze of sexual release. She reached for the wine as she stood and turned to lead me back into the house. We slowly made our way to the living room and as we sat down in the chair, she pulled me back onto her lap. I leaned back into the chair and she lifted and kissed me some more, our tongues wrestling against each other. We broke our kiss and looked into each others' eyes. She smiled.</p> <p>"So we won't have to be this crazy?" she said simply.</p> <p>"No, it's going to be great." I assured her.</p> <p>"So are we?" she said. "Well I'll be ready when you are!"</p> <p>With that, she slid my shorts down and my shorts and shorts dropped around my ankles. She got on her back to pull her legs around my waist. I started to get on my knees as I held her legs in the air and started to lick her already sopping wet pussy.</p> <p>"Ohhhh, my god... ohhhh my god..." she moaned as she watched my head move in and out.</p> <p>"Oh, you taste so good!" I replied as I flicked my tongue on her outer lips.</p> <p>"Ohhhh my god!" she moaned as she tried to hold my head in place.</p> <p>I teased her inner lips and let my tongue flick over the top of her clitoris, causing her to moan even louder. I felt like she was on my tongue and I knew she was right in there so close but not quite touching. This was the first time I had even thought about anything except the fact that I had gotten my way with someone I really wanted to be with.
