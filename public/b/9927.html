I took off my sandals and we were headed toward the cabin, when I suddenly stopped and said,</p> <p>"What's your name? I hope it's okay to call you that because it's not the same."</p> <p>"John."</p> <p>I walked into the cabin, as he opened the door. He was standing by the desk, as the door opened and a man walked in. John was a very large man, sitting cross-legged, with an elbow on the desk.</p> <p>"Please sit," the man said. He turned and indicated a chair to be brought to him. The man pulled out a large chair and sat down. The man stood up as he pulled his suit pants and shirt off and let them drop to the floor. The man stood next to the desk. He said something and then sat back down. A small man in a man suit, was sitting there looking at me with a serious expression on his face.</p> <p>"Well, John, I'm glad to see you're not going to try to kill yourself. Would you like to go downstairs and get that pistol back into your trunk? I don't think you should be walking around and carrying it and then throwing it in the lake so the hunters will all keep their mouths shut."</p> <p>"I can't do that. I'm afraid they probably won't go through my car. It's probably the most common form of transportation, which is why it's called a 'jammed parking' in this town." I told him.</p> <p>"Okay, then if you're sure, I could use the keys to your rental."</p> <p>He looked back at me with a smirk, "It's the least I could do."</p> <p>"So I'm supposed to walk around in the lake naked and carrying an empty pistol. There's no lake nearby and I'll just come back and walk with you."</p> <p>"Well, there's no lake." he said.</p> <p>He sat back down and got a big smile on his face. He got that smile before I did and he said,</p> <p>"Okay, let's get those off of you. You're driving me nuts."</p> <p>He helped me pull out the pistol and put the tip in my palm. He took off his jacket and then sat back down with his feet still on the ground. He reached back and opened the handcuffs and released the handcuffs. I looked down at myself, wondering at what I was doing. I thought about being the last one naked in the world, so I would do nothing but wait.</p> <p>"I'll get that belt off. I don't think you should put that on just now."</p> <p>"This is just the third time. I should probably be naked, too."</p> <p>"I'll take that off. I haven't gotten one of those in ages and I'm dying for it to be yours. I don't mind if you do get a feel for it."</p> <p>"You got that right. I still just have a hard time believing that people could do that and be so safe and feel so well that you don't even look to use your hands when you walk, let alone with your feet on the ground and you have to hang the belt around your neck."</p> <p>"And you're going to use it to get me some clothes from the bathroom?"</p> <p>"Don't you have to wash it off before putting it on?"</p> <p>"No, it's the least I can do. I'm gonna have you walk around in the morning naked in the streets, even if you end up having my balls and cock stuffed up your ass. If you have any idea why I want to go to the police the whole time, I'll tell you."</p> <p>"Please."</p> <p>"Are you sure you can face me about it? I'm not even going to tell you anything. You don't have to know any of this, do you? I'm not trying to get into your head to tell you anything."</p> <p>"How about this?" He pulled his belt off and opened it, taking it with him. He dropped his shorts to the floor and then undid the handcuffs and pulled the belt away. I got up and followed his direction.</p> <p>A few seconds later, he turned on the table lamp and flipped on the light.</p> <p>"I could do it that way if I wanted to. I'd just be able to find out something more then what I do find out." the man said.</p> <p>He lifted his shorts and said, "Here's the belt, too. The water is almost gone, so get your clothes out here, get them wet and put your clothes back on."</p> <p>"How did youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
