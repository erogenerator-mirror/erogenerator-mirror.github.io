I exclaimed at the thought. "The car won't start! Jesus!" I shouted out as I tried to get a grip on the steering wheel. "Jesus!" I repeated at the same time. Then to my horror I saw them turn right to go.</p> <p>"No! Goddammit." I said as I stopped the truck and leaned into the back seat.</p> <p>"Don't blame him. He was so close to getting home before I could stop him." My sister explained as she tried to get out and up ahead. With only 20 minutes left in the day traffic. "But the parking lot is closed and our car's too far ahead," I added as I got up from the truck. "Why would they be late?" I asked as I tried to steady the truck.</p> <p>"Well, we are going to have to go back and take it home," my sister mumbled. I could tell just before they turned off that she had a serious problem.</p> <p>"No...don't!" I pleaded as I drove back to the house. "I have to get to work," I added as I got in the truck's seat. "I have to talk with Dad!" I mumbled as I leaned sideways so I could see my sister's face.</p> <p>"It's okay. I understand," she consoled again as I stared at her face. She looked up at me with her tear running down her cheeks. I had to smile as if I was in shock as much as she looked upset and desperate. But there was more than that. There was something else. A thrill. That, that rush of adrenaline rushing through me was all it took. She looked up at me with excitement that quickly turned into fear that she was really going to do something I wasn't going to enjoy. She looked at me as she tried to calm down.</p> <p>"What?" she asked as she fiddled with the keys. "Are you sure?" her question as an obvious one.</p> <p>"I'm sure." I replied as I shook my head.</p> <p>"Oh Jesus, I can't do this!" my sister moaned as she started to struggle again under my car.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sure," I heard her voice reply once again as she looked around the house. "I have to get to work!" I exclaimed back at her trying to push myself through trying to calm her once again as she started to lose her balance again. This time she had to get up or she would come crashing down on her ass on the steering wheel and go insane.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, honey!" I heard my sister say as she leaned forward again. "It's all right!"</p> <p>"Oh god, he's getting up!" she thought and looked at the clock on the dash board. "Ohhhh...oh my god!" she moaned as she looked at the clock. "Oh my god!" she thought again as she got up and went to her purse to grab her purse.</p> <p>"Can we go to work!" she thought again and took my hand. "Don't you just want to get home?" she asked as she pulled me toward the house. "How far did you think were you going to go?" she asked softly as she pushed herself up on my body and kissed me deeply on the lips.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I replied softly as I felt my heart quicken at the sound of her voice. I knew she had a problem with me wanting to go back to get home to Dad. I knew she just needed to calm down. She tried to pull me in to her with just one arm, but her mind was already lost to what she was doing.</p> <p>"I really want to go back there!" she murmured as she again kissed me tenderly. "I just don't know how...?" she asked looking around once again.</p> <p>"Where do you want to go?" I asked as I stood up straight in between my sister and her purse. The only thing that held her up was her hand, which she took to hold her breast for support. "Do you want to go back there?" I whispered to her as I felt the weight of her body as I pressed my body into hers.</p> <p>"Oh god! Oh my god," my sister thought as she felt her hands coming up to her breasts. "Yes, yes, yes." she said as she continued holding my head and kissing me. "I want to go to work with you!" she added as she held her body closer to mine. I felt as if I was going to explode from the feeling she was giving me. There is no such thing as a bad time for romance.</p> <p>And so we went. But it was getting harder and harder to get a grip on my sister. She couldn't keep up. She was moving too fastâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
