You'd be jealous," I replied.</p> <p>"I just love to watch myself in the mirror. I like to look down on myself," she said taking her time before continuing. "I'm still waiting to get married, but it was nice to finally get to see my son."</p> <p>"And you're already thinking of your husband?"</p> <p>"Yeah, and when will he come home?" she asked, not turning around.</p> <p>"He doesn't mind if I want to watch him come in and get dressed."</p> <p>"Oh, honey. You have no idea. He's just over at the pool."</p> <p>"What? He's not home. You're leaving?"</p> <p>"I'm just taking the kids to bed," I explained. "The house might get all messy, and I've got an extra bedroom in the basement. When will he be here?"</p> <p>"How much of this do you want to hear?" she asked.</p> <p>"I want to hear all about your life," I said. "Will you come home tomorrow and enjoy it?"</p> <p>"I guess you're right," she said, turning back around. "Will your father really be home tomorrow?"</p> <p>"I suppose so," I said, walking over to the stove where I had left the plates.</p> <p>As soon as I sat down I could still hear mom's voice.</p> <p>"He's home tomorrow," mom said. "He'll probably come home early. I'm going for some groceries and we'll eat lunch. You should probably get some things ready, mom. You need to wash up some."</p> <p>"Thanks," she told me.</p> <p>I didn't bother getting anything out. I just washed the dishes and walked out to the kitchen. I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt. My mom was sitting at the table in her robe talking with her friend who had called over the break, and I could see her nipples poking through her robe. I sat down at the table, which did get very uncomfortable as I had no shirt on. It made me look like a schoolboy. My mom looked up at me, and when she looked up again, our eyes met. I looked away, unsure of what to do. I was uncomfortable, so I took my seat.</p> <p>I picked up the dishes and went back to the kitchen. I sat there for a while drinking my soda, trying not to feel exposed. But then, it became harder to concentrate. I felt like I was going to burst into tears. I never got so lonely in my life. I couldn't think straight. I didn't love my life...nothing.</p> <p>After mom finished talking with her friend, she went back to the kitchen to finish the wine. I poured myself another glass. I took my time pouring the wine, enjoying every sip.</p> <p>"So, how was your night, son?" my mom asked as the doorbell rang.</p> <p>"It was ok," I replied. "It was ok."</p> <p>"Oh, you're going to have to excuse us," my mom said, walking down the stairs. I followed her into the kitchen where my mom sat on the counter. I looked at her and then looked at my glass as she turned to me.</p> <p>"This is good," she said, passing me her glass. She took a sip of wine and took a deep breath.</p> <p>"It was nice," she continued talking as she raised her glass to me, then took another sip. She leaned over the counter a bit and leaned on her hands. She began to rub her thighs together.</p> <p>"I'm going to put these things out," she said to me. I looked at her face in the mirror just in time to see her pull her robe open a little farther until the top of her chest was exposed. She then pulled the sides of her robe apart and I noticed that she had no underwear on. I had never been with a woman before. I couldn't wait until this evening to see if I would be so lucky if she would take off her panties.</p> <p>"Are these what you normally wear when you sleep?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah," she said, smiling with pleasure at the answer. "I can sleep in the nude if you like."</p> <p>"I would love to."</p> <p>"Come on," my mom said taking my arm as I helped her up off the counter. We got on our knees. I felt like we were on a stage in some kind of fantasy movie. I reached down to her lap to play with her nipples and she immediately started rubbing her thighs together. She reached down, grabbed her robe, and pulled it open. She pulled it open so I could see the top of her breasts. I reached out and put my hands on her nipples. She moaned softly as she continued stroking her thighs.</p> <p>"Oh, do thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
