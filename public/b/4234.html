I gently pressed my cock against her pussy and I could see that she was completely aroused.</p> <p>Karen pulled away from me and moved from the edge of the bed to the floor on feet. "Sit down and strip," she commanded.</p> <p>I sat down on the edge of the bed and pulled off a silk blindfold. "Oh!" she said, surprised. She smiled at me as she took off the blindfold and looked at me. I smiled back at her and ran my hands all over her body in front of her. I cupped her tits, pushing them up just as I had done with her breasts as the other girls had. I kissed down to her stomach, gently sucking and licking on each of them, her hands moving between her thighs and touching her pussy.</p> <p>I worked my way slowly down, kissing each of her thighs, just stopping to look at those delicious lips. She was incredibly wet. I was now totally immersed in my wife, who was on the floor in front of me. She was spread eagle on the bed and completely naked. I slipped my hand between her legs and stroked her slowly.</p> <p>I stood up off the bed and approached her. "Are you ready to do something, honey?" I asked. She sat up on the bed and raised her head to look at me. I smiled at her and held out my hand for her to take. She took it and slid between my legs.</p> <p>We moved into a 69 position as my wife kneeled over me in front of me and lowered herself onto her knees, her head between my legs. Her tongue was teasing my cock, licking around it, as she reached down and pulled my balls out of their sack. I pushed my cock into her mouth as she wrapped her lips around it and sucked it for a minute. She looked up at me, "You like sucking my balls, don't you?" I nodded yes, in between her sucking motions and her tongue going down the shaft. "I think it was all right for you to suck my cock," I gasped. Karen stopped stroking me and looked into my eyes. "I also love the taste on my dick." I was about to come. "Don't you?" she asked with a pout in her voice.</p> <p>I said, "I know my wife loves it as much as I do. And I love to cum in her mouth." She put her hand back between my legs and started rubbing faster, sucking harder, as she jerked me.</p> <p>Karen took her hand off my cock and stood up slowly. My tongue was still teasing her right nipple, as we watched my wife with her mouth on mine.</p> <p>She kissed me again and straddled my body as she put both hands behind my head. She lifted herself up and guided my cock into her. "Ohhh!" she moaned as I sank to the base of my cock. She started to slowly ride me, moving up and down and in quick, quick strokes.</p> <p>Her tits moved back and forth with my cock deep within her. She used her hands to work my nipples, pulling on them, as she started to suck on my neck. She was completely out of control now, as we both moaned. Suddenly we felt my wife's tongue on my nipples as I felt her pussy tighten and she exploded, pushing herself hard into my cock. She stopped momentarily to breathe hard and let out a sigh as she came down from her orgasm.</p> <p>She leaned over me as my cock softened and slipped from her pussy. I heard her gasp as she looked into my eyes with my cum dripping from her cunt. I smiled and said, "And that was the most sensual thing that I have ever done. Do you think that it is going to be your turn?"</p> <p>"I want you naked in front of me," she answered.</p> <p>I removed my clothes, tossing them on the floor next to my wife's clothes. My wife had gone straight for her blouse, buttoning it in the back to keep it in place while I undressed her in front of me. I removed her shorts as well. I had her raise her arms above her head and turn around to give me a look at her ass as it swung from side to side.</p> <p>I started to undress her, when my wife pushed her way out of the bedroom. "I'm not sure what we are going to put up with," she said. She looked at me, then dropped her shorts, letting her ass and pussy bounce along with her shorts. Her pussy was completely shaven but a thin strip above the lips of her pussy that extended down in front of her pussy. She had a slight patch of auburn hair just above her asshole. I was enticed to taste her, to suck her lipsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
