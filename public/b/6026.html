And he did just that. He kissed. Kisses that brought us to heights of sensation that neither we the other could have imagined... I could not keep his tongue from licking away all traces of jealousy that had just been left behind when we kissed.</p> <p>He sat up, then he leaned down to take me in his arms, and I felt warmth and peace again as he brought my lips to his once more, and we kissed deeply, a smile spread across my face all night, when he brought me back. I felt all the things in me and that made me feel special again, and I started walking towards the house that he knew well from the last time I was here, and I smiled.</p> <p>"I'd love for you to come with me to my bed, would you?"</p> <p>"I'd love to; it's so nice to have someone to share my happiness."</p> <p>He wrapped his arms around me again and we walked out into my garden, I smiled to myself with the first hint of my feelings for him, this man was wonderful... I was glad for him the way I was...</p> <p>It was a beautiful evening.</p> <p>I went outside, I saw him walking out of house, and suddenly I felt happy. I was happy to be with him again...</p> <p>I thought my happiness was more than just having the man I loved with me, I felt something special that I'd never felt with any man before... I wondered what I was thinking right then.</p> <p>I went into the house, he was in his recliner, naked, sitting on my kitchen table, smiling as I walked into the room.</p> <p>"Do you have something I can use to make some coffee or something? I could start in my room, or I could use the kitchen..."</p> <p>The smile on his face as he looked me over made me smile, which only made me happy. He walked up to my desk and pulled out one of the thick, straight-backed chairs, and sat down, looking me over lovingly. I reached forward and unbuttoned the shirt, smiling at how he touched my body... I leaned forward to kiss his forehead, as he sat there, and I slowly unbuttoned his shirt slowly, taking it off his shoulders and down his arms before kissing his chest and stomach. I slowly reached down for his belt, he helped me undo it and I smiled up to him as we kissed again, my arms around his neck. I felt the hardness of his masculinity pressing against my hands. I undid the buttons of his shorts and slid them down his thighs. I held his cock in my hands for a moment before I began to kiss up his chest, kissing his collar bone and his stomach and kissing his thighs... I slowly reached the top of his legs and slid them off, taking his shorts with them.</p> <p>I kneeled before him, kissing his body while I stroked him with my hands. The heat and hardness coming in his cock made my hands tremble, my insides melted at the touch. I leaned forward, running my tongue along his shaft, and began to stroke slow, teasingly. His cock grew harder and wider in my hands, and I moaned lowly at the sight of it. He held his breath and moaned slightly, and I continued to tease him until he began to buck his hips slightly, and slowly, I licked up the shaft of the cock that had made me moan again...</p> <p>When it was fully erect, I lifted it up and began licking it... I licked him down, slowly, taking my time to take every inch of him, all the way down to the base of his balls. I sucked his balls into my mouth one by one before licking and sucking them. I took each one of his balls into my mouth, and the vibrations on the skin that was there made the whole time I was doing that...</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, that's nice..." His voice grew louder as my tongue made its way around the tight sack. I sucked them into my mouth hard, making a loud plop. I was determined to make him cum before I came home... I had no idea that he would do that...</p> <p>I kissed my way to his balls and began to lick them, kissing them over and over. His moans increased and he was on the verge. I pulled away from him, and put my finger to my lips to be heard above his moans.</p> <p>"Cum for me. Cum for me..." I whispered to him.</p> <p>"Oh... Oh... Ohhhh..."</p> <p>I pressed one finger to his lips, and pushed him over the edge as he came. I pressed my finger to his lips even harder, and he sucked me in with his eyes.... He pushed his hips up and pumped his load out while makingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
