Do they have a history? Did their first time together lead to his discovery of another woman that is forever buried within him? Is that what had happened earlier. He had been told by a friend how nice it felt to be desired in a sexual way. When was that? Oh, yeah.</p> <p>'Well, now I know just where you are going. You have all the answers.'</p> <p>'Well, no more questions, though, please,' was her cryptic reply.</p> <p>He thought that was the best answer.</p> <p>'So, just what is it that makes you feel so special to me?'</p> <p>'What do you mean?'</p> <p>'I mean that, for a variety of reasons, you feel like you are special, that you're special in everything. You feel like a special person with a unique sexual sense of belonging.'</p> <p>'I'd really like that ...,' he said with a laugh, not sure he liked the sound of that. 'And ... ' he hesitated, and with an embarrassed expression added, 'do I really love being special as much as I do being...' He paused and then added, 'sexually open.'</p> <p>She laughed again. 'So, you do still love your partner's body, even if they don't.'</p> <p>'If I weren't sure, though, I'd say, if they were both sexily and sexily uninhibited, I'd admit that I do love that body!' He replied.</p> <p>'How about if I say that, you know, as my special gift to you?' she asked, and she paused to look at him. His face brightened. 'You might be surprised at that thought and perhaps even a little turned on by it, which is why I have come up with this suggestion.'</p> <p>He thought. 'Just so long as your partner does not feel that you are cheating. How do you feel about that? Is that what this all means? Does that mean that you also feel that there is something I am not cheating on you, although if it is, then you already have felt the same kind of love for me.'</p> <p>'That's true,' she said in a calm voice. She smiled sweetly, her eyes a soft smile. 'You have always loved me in that way, and we have both felt that there is something special between us.'</p> <p>The thought made him smile.</p> <p>'I love the way I feel. If there is some special part of you that I can't feel in the rest of it, that part I could feel in the way that our love makes us. It is a feeling that is not exactly unknown to me and I will come to know. I'm just telling you that I have felt it as much as ...'</p> <p>His words trailed away. He was not sure about this now. This was his decision. He didn't have to decide anything at all. He had just made that decision and knew it.</p> <p>'Just take it as one for me and I'll do the same.'</p> <p>She did.</p> <p>'Just take it as one for both of us. That's all I want to say.' She said, pulling him in for a passionate kiss. Her tongue darted into his mouth as their passion climbed to new heights, and they made love in complete nakedness right there in the middle of the room.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>It was Friday night when he called that he was meeting his sister. It wasn't until after the phone call that morning that he realized that he had been avoiding her. Perhaps it was because he had no idea what the problem was. He was in his first meeting at a sports bar and was feeling rather lonely. His company felt as if something was missing from his life...</p> <p>So why had he come to this now? He looked at his watch and saw that it was about six in the evening. He was tired. He was feeling a bit hungry and his mind kept wandering about thoughts of how he felt about his sister, and her body, and what he would like to do to her. He didn't want to think about anything else, but at that moment he wanted to touch her, to feel her legs and her body and to feel her breasts, and so much more. Then, suddenly, he had an image of what he would do to her and what he would do to that body. He began to think of himself as a lover, and he had a different idea of him. He wanted to make love to her, but for the short time that they were together, it had not even been that long. There were too many other thoughts running through his head, and he simply let the thought drift away.</p> <p>The phone rang at six in the morning. He had been at the bar for three hours.
