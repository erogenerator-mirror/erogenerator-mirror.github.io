It was so good to have a lover who she could actually experience her body under her own rules, even at a time like this, as she worked herself up to a level where she could simply come down from the orgasm she'd been building. She was so near to going off already, and just as her hand reached her clit, an explosion of ecstasy ripped through her, making her own body convulse and tremble against the vibrating cock that had been giving so much pleasure to her.

It is a feeling not only that is mutual, but one that is uniquely ours.</p> <p>They knew it would only be a matter of a few hours of the weekend before they could start getting together again, and they were also still undecided if they had any real sexual urges that might bring on the "relationship" they had started their relationship with that day.
