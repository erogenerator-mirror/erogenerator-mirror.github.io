I asked.</p> <p>"I do it to make other people happy -- it always has, but it's not as easy as it sounds, you know."</p> <p>She smiled at that, "I understand. It's just a little bit odd."</p> <p>"Yeah," I said, "it is. You want to try it for yourself?"</p> <p>She said, "It does have one advantage -- if we go to the hospital, we'll be out of bed."</p> <p>I said, "That's one advantage I'm thinking over doing. I don't want to take all your clothes and run like a maniac."</p> <p>She said, "Nonsense. I'm only going to do that because I've been practicing with you guys for the past few months. I've been doing this ever since my accident with Tanya."</p> <p>"I know, right...it sounds weird. It's just the things that I did with Tanya."</p> <p>I replied, "Actually, it was more intimate than that."</p> <p>She said, "Yeah, you did a lot of things with Tiffany."</p> <p>I replied, "You were my best friend, that's all."</p> <p>She laughed a little bit, "Yeah, well...I'd say you're more fun to be having sex with."</p> <p>I didn't tell her about any of that -- I had some experience with a few of the girls and I wasn't sure how much I really knew. It was just something that I would feel bad about and I decided to keep things to myself.</p> <p>It was about another month and a little more was coming. I asked her what kind of fun it was if she was sure I wasn't doing anything wrong. She didn't say anything, but she sounded like she was excited.</p> <p>"Would you consider doing some kind of 'missionary'?"</p> <p>"I'd love to," she said.</p> <p>"What about you?"</p> <p>She said, "You're the only one I've ever done this...with."</p> <p>I looked at her, "You're not the first!"</p> <p>"I'm pretty sure."</p> <p>"Well...I might take that as a yes." Then she smiled, "So, how about you?"</p> <p>"I think that would be fun."</p> <p>Then Tiffany and I came to the next week and we talked about it more.</p> <p>Tammie went upstairs after lunch and took Tanya's clothes off and we lay down and started our day. It turned out that Tammie was going to be joining us, so we decided to try out her ability. It was kind of cute so we ended up playing and she had a blast. She still didn't get enough to be a 'pro' because she still wasn't a 'pro.' She liked girls, but I did some practice at having sex with other girls and found that it was exciting. Tiffany and I did one of our mutual sex sessions together as well. She still wasn't a 'pro' and I didn't think she would be but I got my first experience with a girl.</p> <p>Tiffany was in the shower and we were waiting in the shower room when her phone buzzed with a video call on video. We both looked at each other and then Tiffany got up to go change.</p> <p>"Hey," she said, in her normal voice, "did you hear what happened with Tanya?"</p> <p>I replied, "A little, but not bad. She has a talent for taking me home before I go to my own room. I'm going to take some time to get some rest and clean up before we do this, if that's alright."</p> <p>Tammie said, "Sounds good. How long will you be staying?"</p> <p>I responded, "Almost a week. I didn't do much at home in the past. It just felt like you were doing something."</p> <p>Tammie was quiet for a minute, "I'm not sure if I need to say anything."</p> <p>"Tiffany...it's ok if it's awkward or anything," I said.</p> <p>Tammie said, "Maybe I need to get to class or something."</p> <p>"It's ok, Tamm," I said, "we'll always talk about anything."</p> <p>Tammie said, "I'm going to have the same kind of sex with you, but tonight I want to talk about something a little more personal. Can you be my date tonight?"</p> <p>I hadn't even thought about that. I'd never been so sure about a girl that I was sexually attracted to.</p> <p>Tammie said, "I wouldn't want to be your date, but I might be able to help?"</p> <p>I got in the shower with her, soaping her body up, and then turned on some music and we sat down and justâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
