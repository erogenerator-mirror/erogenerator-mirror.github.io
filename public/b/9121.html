Not bad, I thought, because it had gotten to be quite a pair. So I un-fastened the waistband of my skirt, lifted it over my hips and put it on.</p> <p>I stood before the mirror, and looked how I looked; I wasn't bad but not like a "giant" woman or "pretty", but I didn't feel good about them. They were too small and too much fleshy, not to be too sexy, but not "tits", either, anyway. I had to use a lot of baby oil to cover my nipples.</p> <p>For a brief moment, I was surprised that I found myself liking myself. I decided there was no harm in thinking about me as a woman. My tits had not been much of a problem, but I did notice that my shaved pussy wasn't quite as clean as it used to be. It wasn't a lot of pussy juice; I think a mix of my fluids, or juice from her, I think, had been there for a while.</p> <p>I went through the store, checked out and got back to my bedroom. After a couple of tries, I found the top of the shelf and took out a new pair of high heel shoes.</p> <p>They are very high heel and are very fashionable. I didn't think I would wear them, but my body was just going to get a bit of attention from them. I decided the new pair were too "hot" to wear at home, and I could get away without bothering with a bra.</p> <p>I took a short, light brown dress with an empire-fashion V-neck, high, and the top of the dress just below the V in my breasts. The top of the dress buttoned up the front in a sort of French-button "H" line, a style of which I never wore, and it just came straight to just under the top of my breasts, not below my nipples. It was very thin, so there was no bulge in it. Just the right height to slip into a skirt, and keep it buttoned all the way up.</p> <p>It had a zipper at the back that came just above the bottom. It went all the way to the top of my ass, and just barely ran as my legs went into it. When I left the back of my dress it was just about the same height as my breasts.</p> <p>The skirt seemed to be just a little too short, but it also seemed to be a lot of work and not very sexy, but it was not at all in disrepair. I even went through another couple of skirts, each shorter than the one before. When I got back, with only the top button buttoned, I just got it through the first button and buttoned the rest. What a difference.</p> <p>The top of the outfit was too much to wear as it rode up my tits, and when I tried to button it up a bit, it seemed that it got very taut and squeezed my boobs together. It was too hard to button it up, but with lots of effort.</p> <p>After an uncomfortable long couple of hours, I got up and changed out of the outfit and onto the skirt.</p> <p>The front panel looked way too pretty, and I kept putting it on before I left home to go look at it and see what it was.</p> <p>The back, like the bottom, was too tight. I figured I had to go with the dress, but the bottom just had the buttoned back button.</p> <p>I tried both ways - back and forth, up and down, and up and down, and I couldn't keep up with it.</p> <p>When I got home, I tried to get the top one loose and on, but got it off and hung it up. It wasn't too tight, and if the bottom didn't do the job it was too short. I tried, it was still tight to the top, but I could do it and it still stuck to my ass, but it did everything.</p> <p>I started to dress up a lot, and tried to put on a couple of dresses I had bought. As I pulled all of them together, theyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
