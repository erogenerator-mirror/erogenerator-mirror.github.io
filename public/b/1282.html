"How have you been? I'm looking forward to getting to know you. What about your home town?" She asked as she made coffee.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm in Maryland. I had a summer job, doing landscaping and stuff." He smiled.</p> <p>"Good," she said. Her voice was soft and musical, as if she were the first person in her life who could really get to know her. "I'm sure it won't be too bad at all. Maybe a bit lonely. I'm sure you can convince your wife of letting you take her up there." She raised an eyebrow at him; he knew her body was all woman. He couldn't keep his eyes off her ample curves, especially when they were naked. Her breasts were still not big as she had liked; they didn't go over well with the tanning bed tanning lotion she kept.</p> <p>"You really don't mind me coming up here to have a chat with her?" he asked. That question hadn't been in his head for more than a day.</p> <p>"Just to let you know that I think you might be a nice guy, and not the type to get into trouble with her and her family. I'm sure there will be a couple of girls, too. She's probably more curious than you are." That made him both relieved and intrigued.</p> <p>They chatted for a while about this and that, just chatting, until they realized that she was in a cab headed over to dinner. Then, it was dinner for a while. When they got out onto the street, they saw that there was a local restaurant only about half a block down on the other side of the street. It was a beautiful, small, old restaurant. They had to walk into the back, which was mostly empty, and they walked in a dazed and confused way for a long while. It was quite crowded with tables, booths and windows showing the lights from the main room of the restaurant. Then, she pushed the glass door open and started taking out chairs, serving them drinks. When they were finished, a waiter pulled out menus and took a look at their plates. Then, the waiter started back to his job and left them alone.</p> <p>The food soon filled their stomachs, and they were soon eating with each other. They started eating while talking, and as soon as they finished eating, they were back to having conversation. They started laughing again when they finished their dinner and she excused herself to go and get changed. When she returned, she didn't wait to use her restroom; instead, she went into the dining room with him, and they sat down and had a quick conversation about everything that had happened while they were there during dinner. They talked about their respective jobs and the life of home town. They had come to the conclusion that they might be in a very good place in each other's lives next.</p> <p>Just as he was about to say something when he felt her hand on his leg, he looked over at her. "Is there something I could fix for you?" She asked.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," he said. His eyes looked from her, up to her face, and then back to his face, "I could use something just as good. I need a good buzz on my cigarette." He smiled.</p> <p>"Good," she said. And with that, they went back to talking; although she kept stealing looks at his legs when they talked. She made sure that when she came back into a chair she had good eye contact with him, looking up into his eyes. She was always careful to make eye contact with him and always wanted to keep him interested in her. For some reason, she was the way his mother would ask him to come with her to the local church group; that was a favorite of his mother's. She was a good teacher, too; she always kept a nice home and a good income, and never gave him problems.</p> <p>When he brought their cigarettes to them, they each started their conversation.</p> <p>"The first two were the same," she said. "And the third was not at all the same."</p> <p>"So, what is the problem?"</p> <p>"There are some things I don't usually talk about right, as you probably already noticed," she said. Then she turned to him. "So, why don't you come and sit with us; I have some things to show you, and a few other things I might help you with before you get too much sun." She smiled at him and leaned over to him, her breasts moving enticingly against his inner thigh. She saw as he smiled. She saw as he looked right at her nipple.</p> <p>He took a big one, and held it up for her and she looked over at him with a smile.
