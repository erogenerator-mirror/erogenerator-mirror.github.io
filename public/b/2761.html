And it has gone back to the way that it was.</p> <p>I'm writing this story to see how long it's been going on. The "bump and grind" part can be interesting, but I'm pretty certain that's the ending. So, let me know what you think. I also have a lot of reading to do for the future. I hope you enjoy.</p> <p>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p> <p>The next few days have consisted of more sleep then I can stand. The night before I had a few very bad memories. And the next few days had been almost torture. This time of year is a bit different as it was Christmas. We had spent a lot of the holiday year alone. One of our favorite activities was a night out. We had just been going to a club in town and had gotten a booth in the back. After a few drinks I had sat down on the hard seat near the back. I had put my feet up to the booth, but in reality I was resting the length of my legs on the middle of the seat.</p> <p>I was trying to figure out what happened when I began to wonder. I had stopped the music and had just rested my feet on the edge of the booth. There was nothing in what happened that wouldn't have made a big shock to anyone sitting in the booth. And, by the looks of things, who would stop me after that?</p> <p>I was sitting in a short leather skirt and a teddy with my feet on the back seat. You could hardly see me from there, but the darkness still obscured my view. The music was playing. And I was on some sort of dance floor. And I had no clue where the music was going. The entire table was packed.</p> <p>It was going to be a long time before the entire table came to life.</p> <p>And my heart wasn't in it. I felt a little sad inside. And I didn't want to talk to anybody. I still had the same feelings as before, but this time I wasn't sure what to do.</p> <p>I turned around and took a deep breath before I continued.</p> <p>I told myself that I had to get away from there. No one could have noticed that I was there. I went back to the bar and ordered another drink. I could feel it starting.</p> <p>The drink that I had taken was in fact a Long Island Iced Tea, which had been in my room for a couple of months at the time. Then I took another pull and began to feel the pain of the pain. Again.</p> <p>And it was gone.</p> <p>I got to my feet and turned around. I had to turn about, but I couldn't stop the tears when they began to run down my face.</p> <p>I didn't know what to do. I had been through something very bad. And I just knew. I didn't think a long while ago, I might have done this. I really don't think it's any of those things anymore. I could have never told my parents about it but something in my life had changed. That's what it is. Something that had changed my life. Something that made me realize just how much this made me. I had to give something back to myself. I made a little sound that was the same one that she had used in the music on the second of January, which was the 'hurry' part of one of our Christmas parties. I just knew.</p> <p>My thoughts were still heavy. My emotions were still strong and they wouldn't let me go back. I just had to hold them close to me. I held on tight.</p> <p>Then as one last time I turned and headed back to the bar I felt something fall in to the middle of the floor. I couldn't be sure what I was looking into but I sure as hell knew that there was a very small pile of what I could have sworn was semen that had leaked out over the metal table cover.</p> <p>And with that, she was standing in the middle of the floor.</p> <p>She had a glazed look in her eyes. It was the last thing that I saw of her.</p> <p>What else could I say.</p> <p>I made my way back to the bar and sat down. I had only ordered a beer when I heard a noise. I looked over to see the man that I had thought was something else walking back to me from behind the bar. But the face didn't change in any wayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
