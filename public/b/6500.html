I got the impression that this was some kind of "discovery project" or adventure.</p> <p>"I'd like that, but not like this," she said, moving away. "I didn't see how it would go that way. And anyway I'm sure you won't mind me bringing some stuff in," she said, stepping back to make room for me. "Do you mind if I stay in?" she asked, looking at me, still in a way, trying to understand me.</p> <p>"Not at all, baby, I don't mind at all," I said, reaching out to pull her in for a hug, trying not to get caught in a big mistake. "Of course, you're right. I'm glad you're okay!" I said, pulling her away to give myself some space.</p> <p>"I still want you, Tim, all of you, but we'll have to go slowly before it makes a difference for us," she said, giving me the look.</p> <p>"Well then, we'll have to go a little slower before we can really go any further," I said softly to her, getting a bit playful.</p> <p>"A lot slower, and I'll be back to watch," she said, kissing me lightly.</p> <p>"I love you, Jan," I said when I was done, then kissed her once more. "This is something I really want to have, and I will never think of another time where I can do it with you."</p> <p>It had been months since I had been with Jan. For some reason I had been feeling guilty, and I didn't know what to do about it. I decided to come around for some drinks, and then we'd spend some time in my bedroom, kissing and touching each other. I could feel my cock coming back to life.</p> <p>When we'd finished the drinks and we were standing in the corner, with the stereo down and her still pounding hard music blasting softly on the stereo, I stepped back to say "Let's find a dance floor." Once we'd got into a little dance floor, we quickly stripped out of our clothes and began dancing, just the way we had been years ago.</p> <p>We were kissing and feeling each other up all the way to our room, my dick poking her in the back, and we were still naked. Once in the back room, we took off each others clothes, and went into bed, in the dim flickering light from the Christmas tree. And the only time we had sex was in the car on the way here in the dark of night, on the way to the party, with a raging hardon that we both knew we had to take care of soon. We were making love when I got the surprise of my life, she had taken off the strap holding her dress over her right shoulder. I was going to enjoy this, to show that our relationship had been strong enough and that I had to make sure that I would never have to hurt both of us, but she didn't seem to notice me looking at her as she stood there, giving me a look at what she had on.</p> <p>We both knew what I wanted, and what we wanted from the other person, so we kept kissing, while I stripped her as I moved to undo the last strap between her shoulder and shoulder, and then, finally, to the front of her dress. She didn't even bother to tell me to remove it, although she didn't have to. I pulled the shoulder straps down her arms and she threw her arms around my neck as we made out, my dick pushing hard into her belly as we kissed. I finally unzipped the dress, letting it fall to the floor. She kicked off her heels, and helped me remove her panties, which I discarded in the bathroom, then laid her down on the bed. A moment later, I was kneeling between her legs, looking at her naked pussy just inches from my face. Jan was definitely enjoying it, she was breathing very hard, and she was rubbing her pussy up and down mine while I kissed and licked her pussy lips and clit, flicking it back and forth. The sight of her lovely dark pubic hair pressed against mine only served to enhance her arousal that much more. Finally, she started to speak, but I just held her at a point where I didn't even need to speak, and she just nodded as her hips began to move again.</p> <p>With the whole scene out in the open, I was left to watch my wife getting it on with another man. Her hips were moving as she made love to me again and then again, thrusting her head back so she could kiss me as her wet, bare, pussy clamped down on my mouth as she came again.
