She smiled as she saw the faces around her.</p> <p>Sue's boyfriend had called her name in a whisper, while trying to keep her eyes on the road. He had been a little drunker than necessary to call and say he was going out and he could see how hot she was. She loved seeing him trying to talk down to her.</p> <p>She saw him pulling into the same parking lot again, after she had dropped the last of the last of the two bags of groceries in the car. This time, he pulled the car out of the lot, and had been holding her hand through the whole incident.</p> <p>"Hey Sue," he said with a grin, as he stepped out of his car.</p> <p>"Well, look what I found," she said as she saw the man that she'd been so attracted to earlier at the restaurant. He was about her age, and it was getting late, but the man in his late forties was handsome and had a nice smile that was easy to get into.</p> <p>"Hi yourself," the woman said, as she looked at him a few times. She watched him look over her glasses, then back at her as he took a seat and took the few steps over to her.</p> <p>"How you doing, miss?" he asked.</p> <p>"Not too bad, I think," she answered. It wasn't her fault, but some were. "Did you know we're here? This is my boyfriend's car."</p> <p>He took her hand in his and held it to his. "Yeah, I know. Don't let me bother you," he said, before he took hers as well.</p> <p>His hand felt warm to her fingers, and Sue knew she had missed a lot of the foreplay from the night before. Now here he was holding her hand.</p> <p>The man that she'd been looking at earlier sat down next to her. The second person that she had been looking at, was this handsome dark good looking guy. He was smiling broadly at her as a hand came to rest over hers on the steering wheel. She looked down at her hand. It was covered in her juices. The hand had been resting on her bare leg just a few inches over the knee of her jeans.</p> <p>"Sue," he said, holding her hand.</p> <p>Sue looked up at him and smiled as if to say, 'Oh, my God, will I do this?'</p> <p>"Yeah, sure," he smiled back.</p> <p>"What? Where are we going? How do we get home?" she asked.</p> <p>"I was thinking," he said, pulling his hand out of hers, and sliding it into her lap. "How about you let me buy you a beer?"</p> <p>Sue looked at the man who had just given her a second hand, and she immediately noticed that his hand had also dropped from her knee up into her jeans before he had taken a grip on her hand and was guiding it to the ground.</p> <p>"Yeah," she said. "Yes, let's go," she said after he did. Turning her eyes back to the road ahead, she pulled her hand away from his to look at the man that had given her a second hand.</p> <p>"He bought me a beer," she said, looking at the second hand.</p> <p>The man chuckled, pulled out his pocketknife and handed Sue the knife.</p> <p>"I didn't know you were a blade player," he said, as she looked at him with the knife, and then back to the car. "You're really sexy," he smiled as she looked at his face. "It's a big thing for a woman to be dressed like one."</p> <p>For some reason, Sue really liked the way the men that she went out with talked to her about his wife. The way they talked and talked, they kept asking what they did in her life that made her feel like he knew a lot about her. Most of her friends were married with a child, and she had an open relationship with their husbands.</p> <p>At some point she was going to be able to find out why his car had got into that parking lot, the second hand, that he had dropped her purse in just moments before.</p> <p>Her pussy was getting damp as she followed him back to the house.</p> <p>When they reached her house, Sue stood next to him, waiting. After a moment he took her hand again, and led her to her front door. Sue hesitated before she turned her face, and kissed the second hand on the cheek.</p> <p>"It's fine, sweetheart," he saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
