And now, I am standing here, holding your hand in mine, gazing down at you and listening to you whisper your love for me.</p> <p>As I look down and admire your form in the candlelight, you are trembling all over. I know I should be jealous of you, but instead, I feel more empowered. You will find you have to have this relationship with me, and it is your decision, not mine.</p> <p>We hold there. As the night grows hotter, light is starting to fall.</p> <p>You are sweating. You've put your heels on. I could see the wetness on your legs in the dim light.</p> <p>I stand you up a little bit, and I take your jacket off. Then, I take your hand and place it on the tablecloth, then turn you around. I kiss your neck, and slowly move your chair so I can be in you better.</p> <p>You are leaning back now. The moonlight shines brightly on you, and you see the shadows of shadows dancing on the tabletop. I slowly lower you on the cold tablecloth. With one hand on your breast, I run the other down your back till I feel the curves of your ass. I feel your hot skin on mine, feel every crevice of you.</p> <p>I bend me over slightly, and your arms are resting on my back, and you turn to kiss me. I can feel your hands cupping and kneading my breasts as we kiss. As our tongues are rubbing, I could feel you trying to reach down and feel my hairless pussy, even as I am rubbing it between my fingers.</p> <p>I lean myself forward to kiss you again, and pull away. But you stop me with a hand on my hips.</p> <p>"No, please," you say as you reach down to take my bra off. Then, your hands go back to my breasts. You massage, cup and massage them as I look down and watch you caress my breasts as you massage them. Your hands continue on, now sliding around my neck and shoulders. You kiss up my neck, and I run your fingers along the soft flesh of my breasts. I feel myself already getting very wet.</p> <p>Again, your hands take my bra off. I raise and pull yours back as you undo the catch and let the straps fall down.</p> <p>"You have beautiful breasts," you say. We are both breathing heavily now.</p> <p>I lean back against the cool table while your hands continue rubbing my tits. My nipples erect and standing proud, begging to be caressed.</p> <p>"Please," I say as I feel your fingers run down my stomach towards my aching pussy. But you stop to let me stand. When I turn around, I see that you had forgotten to tie your jacket and skirt.</p> <p>"Please, no!" I beg.</p> <p>You turn away, then bend in the way that you have so willingly bent me over. "What about the panties," you ask of me.</p> <p>"It's too much," I say. "It'll be too much."</p> <p>You reach down and pull off your jacket, then, without breaking eye contact with me, you begin to pull your panties down. As the first piece of cloth comes down, you step out of them. You drop them to the floor beside us on the floor. I lean forward a little and look at you. Your face is still glowing with the flame of the fire. You drop your panties next, then stand, looking at me.</p> <p>"This is going to be a long night," your words, and that's all it takes, I say. That's all it takes.</p> <p>The two of us get on the other side of the table, and your knees are on mine. I put my hands on your ass, and you spread them so I can look down and see you rubbing your clit in slow circles with your middle finger.</p> <p>And I can feel the heat of your wetness on my thighs.</p> <p>"I'm going to have your pussy," I say.</p> <p>You look at me and smile. I don't have to ask, even though I have no doubts.</p> <p>"I'm ready," you say. And I am, too.</p> <p>I feel myself getting wet by you. I move my clit gently between two fingers as I move closer.</p> <p>You say, "This is going to be a long night," and begin rubbing your clit in slow circles again.</p> <p>I can feel how wet I am. You're like a furnace now. I can see your hand running up and down your now-hard clit. You are trying to hold back, but I stop you.</p> <p>"This will have to last," I promise.</p> <p>And I promise I will.</p> <p>We kiss for what seems like an eternity. I feel the warmth of your mouthâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
