She pushed their weight back into the warm room, and then she sat up, her breasts bouncing with her movements.</p> <p>Gerald began to move toward her, his erection beginning to throb in and out of her while her fingers continued to tickle his bottom. He slid his arm around her waist and grabbed the small of her back. Her fingers were massaging his shoulders, his neck, and his back while her breasts rose and fell with her breaths.</p> <p>"I could do this all night," she purred seductively.</p> <p>"You can do," he growled, reaching up to touch her face and neck.</p> <p>She leaned toward him, her arm reaching back to stroke his chest. He moved her hand away but she didn’t pull away. Instead, she slid hers down his legs toward his hips, then stopped. When she finally grasped him she brought him to her, her lips pressing against his. He grabbed the hem of her nightdress, his fingers running over the taut skin of her buttocks. She lifted her legs in the air and wrapped them around his waist, moaning as his shaft pressed against her thigh.</p> <p>The feeling was like nothing Gerald could ever remember. It was as if he were holding her breath while his cock pushed against her thigh on and in-between. Her mouth was hot, and she was sucking as hard as she could. His cock was throbbing but he didn’t want to come all the way out. He gently moved her hair away from her face and back to her neck as she kissed him deeply, sucking on his tongue.</p> <p>"I shoulda waited till," he mused. "It's a little overcast."</p> <p>"I’m just fine," she said as she kissed his collarbone, pushing out her tongue with his name on it.</p> <p>"I've still got a little while to get going though," he chuckled as he slid his hand up under the hem of her nightshirt, tracing her lips with his finger. He lifted her chin then looked into her face. "What do you say we go up to my room and do what you said we agreed to do."</p> <p>The question was rhetorical, but it had an appeal to it. She smiled and nodded her head, and then moved toward the door. "I'll walk," he said, "and take the car if you want to hang with me."</p> <p>"Not right now," she grinned. "I'll grab a cab and we can get to the hotel."</p> <p>"Oh I already did that, I never got a chance to see the room," he said as he drew her into the darkness.</p> <p>"Are you kidding? No way. In fact, I never even thought of this. What a waste." She kissed him deeply again as they walked into the darkness.</p> <p>He pushed her gently against the door with her back resting on his body. The sensation from her breasts pushing against his back as he bent forward and kissed her made him hard again in an instant. They stumbled off the stairs and went up the stairs.</p> <p>"I didn't even realize you were so tall," he teased her.</p> <p>"And I thought I was only five feet even," she grinned. "Besides, I'm not the biggest girl in school, especially when it comes to people." She giggled.</p> <p>"I have no idea about people," he said as he kicked his shoes off and reached down to start the zipper on his fly. "Besides, I can’t afford to buy myself another drink tonight."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she smiled with a shy little giggle.</p> <p>He kissed her again as his hand began to wander over her ass. He pushed her skirt up until it was up so she knew he was going to remove the nightie. His hands moved up to cup her breasts and he began to suck on her nipple, gently pulling on it with his lips and rubbing his tongue over it.</p> <p>"Please," she whispered.</p> <p>He lowered his head quickly; his mouth covering her nipple and sucking on it, before moving to her other nipple. She had already sucked on him before, but she had never been this wet before. She had hoped that he would take her, and now it was more than she could take, but she didn’t know whether she could take him any harder. Her fingers had not been idle; their bodies were now aching for that penetration.</p> <p>Gerald was on his knees, his hands pulling her panties off her legs as she raised them back over her legs for him to remove them. "Are you sure?" he asked as he lowered his head—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
