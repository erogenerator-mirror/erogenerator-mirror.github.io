To be fair, it was the first time she was taking a shit from a guy, no matter how much shit she was getting. But having sex with a guy was still pretty fucking hot, if you loved her so fuck her.</p> <p>Beth finished washing the dishes while Sara cleaned her hands and got another plate out of the cabinet. As they ate in silence they each had a cigarette. Beth started smoking. Sara sat there like a dummy, trying not to get the dope in her stomach into her mouth. It didn't work.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," Beth said. "Can you blame me if I've been a little too nice to you?"</p> <p>"I don't blame you," Sara said. "I was a bit nervous when you first came along. But the harder part came when you started to loosen up. By the end of the summer it seemed so natural to start to touch you. I mean we were living together and if we got caught, it would be a whole new world."</p> <p>"I don't know," Beth said sadly. "I guess I just got used to being alone and not having anyone to care for me anymore."</p> <p>Sara hugged her. "Sara told me one day just before you started to get better that you were, that you wanted to hang out with guys, that you were a little more adventurous. And I told her I didn't understand. And she said she had a boyfriend that lived here and even though she was a bit older than me, she and yours went to the same college. Then when you got older I was sure you and the guy had a good time and a lot of drinking."</p> <p>Beth laughed. It sounded funny, but she wasn't going to cry. Sara could see that Beth wasn't going to be able to contain herself. "I guess you have some sort of family thing with your parents."</p> <p>"Yeah," Sara said. That was funny and it seemed like it would make all the difference at the end of this summer.</p> <p>Beth held up her cigarette. "That seems like a good time to stop," she said.</p> <p>"Well it was about a month ago," Sara said. "I had just moved to LA, and I was staying in a big hotel that didn't have a door, but I can't say I didn't want to get out, too. I kind of wanted to have some fun in the city."</p> <p>Beth shook her head. "I couldn't let you go. It was too good a chance to miss. So you might want to have fun. I just hope you don't regret it."</p> <p>"I don't have much of a choice," Beth said. "I can't just let you have this little fun. So long as you want out."</p> <p>Sara put her arms around Beth. "How about we take this summer to see if we can make ourselves more useful to you?"</p> <p>The two of them started kissing passionately while rubbing their bodies together. Their mouths were just on fire and they could taste the remains of Beth's lipstick. Sara reached behind Beth, grabbed her thong and pulled it down to her ankles. She leaned in and flicked her clit with her tongue. Then she took the little bud of flesh into her mouth and slowly sucked it, licked it and sucked it some more. Her hands were exploring Beth's body while Sara's mouth went to her breasts, where she sucked gently but hungrily. Sara pulled her thong off and tossed it into an empty room pocket. She held up her hand as she sucked Beth's tits.</p> <p>Sara got on all fours and looked back over her shoulder as she kissed her way up. She reached behind her with her free hand and cupped Beth's big butt. "So fucking tight," she cooed. "Such a tight asshole." She knelt up and brought her face to Beth's lips. While they had always been close friends, she couldn't really believe they were each other's friend and lovers. She couldn't help feeling like she was the first person that Sara had ever been with before this. In her mind the kiss was the last kiss they had ever shared. The way they fit together felt so real. Their bodies would just fit together and when they made each other cum, it would feel like their orgasms. Every part of her told her to let it go, to let the moment go, but in her brain her body didn't know what.</p> <p>When Sara finally pulled away she was just in plain sight of her roommates and they were still just staring at their naked bodies. This made them appear even more naked. And in Sara's mind that was a perfectly fucking good time! Sara grabbed her purse and was about to put it in her bag when the door opened and she looked at her friendâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
