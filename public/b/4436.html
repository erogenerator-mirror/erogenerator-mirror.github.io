He began stroking himself, as I moved my fingers up and down the length of his shaft.</p> <p>"Hurry up, put your shirt in the pocket." I said, as I got up and pulled the shirt out from under my skirt.</p> <p>As I bent down to pick it up, I reached my other hand around him and grabbed his balls. He tried to cover himself with his hands, but I was too caught up in the moment. I pulled down his underwear and freed his cock. The pre-cum was oozing out of him as I started stroking him. He was already hard before I had put the shirt on, and as I stroked him I bent down and licked the juice off my fingers.</p> <p>I then crawled my way up his body, kissing him as I rubbed up and down on him. He moaned as I continued kissing him, our tongues flicking around each other.</p> <p>"Ohhh..." He sighed "Oh wow..." The sound was almost drowned out by the music, as I pulled out his cock and started to stroke it before I kissed the head.

He slid a finger into my cunt, and then pulled them out, and I leaned down, as his cock entered me.</p> <p>"Fuck this is so fucking good," He said, as he began thrusting himself into me.</p> <p>I could only moan and groan around him, as he thrust into me and I felt his hot cum pumping into me.</p> <p>"Oh yeah...that's it" I moaned, as he finished filling me up, before falling down against the sofa.</p> <p>As I got up again, he said "wow, you really are a dirty girl." As he pulled his pants back up and buttoned them up, and I did the same. We were both getting off and I was going to return the favor; I kissed him passionately, before walking into the bedroom.</p> <p>I stopped in the doorway, before he could see me, and he asked "What's in the bedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
