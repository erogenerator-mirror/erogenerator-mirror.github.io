He lowered his eyes as she drew closer.</p> <p>"Oh? Do you not feel that way? No, no. My name and your own, I have told you so, I am not afraid." He moved his eyes away and turned to glare at her.</p> <p>"I, I am sorry. I understand...there. I see, my parents made it very clear to me what was going on in your life...it was never one of our little talks. I also know you and I will not stay this way." Tears began to form in her eyes, but he kept her face, not looking away.</p> <p>He stood and walked the few steps to her and knelt down in front of her.</p> <p>"Kiss me." He said softly, looking into her eyes. She held onto his hand and pressed his face against her lips. Her mouth opened and he pressed his tongue against her lips. Their tongues played across. There bodies pressed together as her hands reached for his shirt. She rubbed her hands over his biceps and he pressed her tight against him, wanting to feel her again. A few minutes passed before they broke their kissing. He looked down on her face, her eyes sparkling, but with a slight smile. He looked back down at those full breasts he had seen in a bikini, the very thin shirt.</p> <p>"You are not going to believe what you've heard from the girls at college...I knew you from your family...and they, they were there when you were growing up, wasn't they." He said, looking up towards the ceiling.</p> <p>"It was a lot like your father's." She replied.</p> <p>"Well, you'll soon see this. Now, let's see what you think about the way you feel when I tell you how I would like it from you." He pulled her to him, his warm lips to her neck. He kissed softly, his teeth nipping at her skin. He loved that it made her gasp. She tried to move away, his hands sliding down her small frame to the sides of her breasts, pinching the erect nipples through her shirt. His lips moved down her throat, following the line of the buttons to the soft skin just above her stomach. He kissed the underside of her breasts, and then he kissed down her stomach to the top of her shorts. He pulled the fabric slowly out, exposing her long, shapely legs...she was wearing a thong. Her breath quickened as he knelt before her. He raised an eyebrow at her as he took her entire crotch into his mouth, his tongue licking her slit. She pulled his hair tightly and began to moan as his tongue probed her folds. She pushed him back against the wall, and moved her hands down to his shorts, ripping them off.</p> <p>"Not here." She pulled his t-shirt off over his head. She stood before him in only her shorts and her own shirt. She began to unbutton his shirt as his hands roamed over her body. He caressed her stomachs, her sides, she reached for him as her fingers rubbed through his wet hair. Her kisses and his kisses grew hotter and wetter as they rubbed their nipples against the material of his shirt. He put his hands over hers and she pulled back. "Let's go to the bedroom." He nodded as he stood. He led her towards the bed and dropped his shorts on the floor. He pulled her to her feet and kissed her again, holding her close. As their tongues danced, he undid her shirt and pulled it off. He kissed her chin as his fingers slipped down to slide the straps off her chest. He slid his hands down her stomach and kneaded at her breasts as she reached for him. "Let me." She smiled.</p> <p>He removed her shorts and he knelt in front of her. He could smell her arousal and he raised his face to her, kissing her thighs as he brought his hands up to her naked mound. He used his hand to guide her, sliding his fingers across her lips, then into her. He licked her slowly, enjoying her. He brought her legs up a little as he continued his oral assault on her body. His finger circled her clit, circling as she moved towards him. He slid his hand out of her and lifted her, laying her on the bed. He moved his hands up her body to cup her breasts, pulling her nipples slightly with his fingers. He felt her body tense as his own touched her. Her eyes squeezed shut as she came, screaming his name.</p> <p>"No, no, not here." He released her from her grasp as she began to get up on the bed. He pushed her back down on the bed, standing before her. He moved to her mouth, kissing, tasting her mouth as heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
