I got him drunk and he fucked my girlfriend. He took her to the party and then threw her out. I had no idea the party was so bad."</p> <p>The thought of me being in the situation caused me to drop her the cup to keep her upright.</p> <p>"Is this true, Mr. Davis?" she asked as I continued.</p> <p>"Of course it's true. This is my first time. I took a leak. Can you believe it?"</p> <p>I could barely contain my grin. She never let me tell the truth. It has always been the case. My family taught me that the good and bad, the mind can play cards.</p> <p>Lena, however, had the same thought. She said "Mr., I am very upset."</p> <p>I had the sudden desire to tell her that she never could have done what she did. Yet, there was no way that I would have let her.</p> <p>"What's on my mind?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm sorry you felt that way. Things have been very upsetting for a while. I had a really bad experience in the car and so I have been trying to think of other ways I can make it up to you.</p> <p>Why don't you come over here and sit on my lap?"</p> <p>I had to think of something that could make my life easier, anything at all.</p> <p>"I'm so embarrassed Mr. Davis. Please forgive me."</p> <p>I handed her the cup of coffee, but my eyes were drawn to the dark cleavage between her large breasts that was now pressed against my forearm. They sagged slightly as they moved. I also noticed that her eyes seemed to have a little glint in the light of the room. Her eyes were staring me dead in the eye and I couldn't help but stare back. A bit of excitement seemed to be in her eyes as she looked down at the floor in front of her. It's a very attractive look for such a pretty girl.</p> <p>I leaned my head forward and took her mouth in an intimate kiss. I was feeling the warmth of her lips through my shirt. With the tip of my tongue, I began to trace a trail along her upper lip where her tongue would gently push against her moist lips. Her eyes closed in pleasure as her tongue was pressed against her mouth.</p> <p>Her other hand reached out and began to stroke my rapidly increasing crotch.</p> <p>"I know you must be frustrated Mr. Davis. I've got this thing on, you shouldn't be sitting here. I could use a good night's sleep. Let's order Chinese and have some lunch. I'm starving."</p> <p>She had a point. I was feeling pretty good myself.</p> <p>"Can you help me by putting on a bra?"</p> <p>She giggled and slid her hand inside of mine. I could feel how firm her ample breast was beneath and I had to admit that they were very enticing. My prick was sticking straight out over the open fly of my shorts, her hand just barely covering it.</p> <p>"Oh! What an incredible sensation. You're doing a great job of helping me." I could hear her talking, but I had no idea if she was talking to me or looking at me.</p> <p>"I really have to take a quick shower and run off," she whispered.</p> <p>"Well, there might not be that many of us going to the bathroom in a short while. You'd better get the soap and wash it before we get in the car, but maybe that will clear out with a decent dose if you get it?"</p> <p>My response was "Oh, I wouldn't mind taking a handful," and she giggled again as she reached out to gently cup my now very full pecker, running her tiny fingers over the head every so often. She must have noticed the expression on my face.</p> <p>"Just take care of it for me then, young man."</p> <p>I finished washing myself and turned to retrieve the soap again.</p> <p>I turned back to the living room to notice Mr. Davis again. My head was feeling kind, as well as feeling a little queasy.</p> <p>I could sense an excitement in his voice and I looked around. He had a tray on the back of the couch. On the same couch the two of us were sitting. On the table beside the tray lay a small glass tray filled with some kind of beverage.</p> <p>He was obviously enjoying his own cooking, I could certainly imagine.</p> <p>"Ladies," he beckoned, "Why don't you join us. I have a special dinner prepared for us. Would you like to accompany me?"</p> <p>He was obviously enjoying putting on this show for us. As he reached forward toward me with his free hand, I looked down at his crotch. I couldn't see much except the tip of his manhood which was now beginning toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
