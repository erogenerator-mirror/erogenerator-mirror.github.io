Are you doing this for the money?" She asked nervously.</p> <p>"For the sex?" I asked.</p> <p>"You know exactly what that is, don't you?"</p> <p>"Yes, I do."</p> <p>"Don't do it! Don't touch me. I don't want that!" I said.</p> <p>"I'm sorry!" She said, "I'm sorry. I'm not a prostitute."</p> <p>"But you are! I don't know how these people can know we're doing it." I told her. She couldn't say it, she didn't even want to say it, but it was true. Her words were the most honest I'd heard in years.</p> <p>All the money was in my pocket on the floor.</p> <p>I held back her hand and looked at it in horror.</p> <p>It was all mine. I had to hold it. Even though she couldn't, there were plenty of people outside to see those bruises.</p> <p>My wife was scared now. "Why do you have to do this? It's all your money. It was all mine." I looked at her. I didn't care that she was so much younger. But I thought if she didn't stop now would she be able to?</p> <p>"It's your choice, or not." I told her.</p> <p>"I'll go with you." I told her.</p> <p>"I will go!" She told me. And she walked toward the door just a breath away from me.</p> <p>I held out my hand to keep her hand. "I want to see you again. Please go."</p> <p>"You want it too." She told me.</p> <p>"No." I told her.</p> <p>"Then go." I told her. She opened the door and walked outside.</p> <p>"What was that about?" She was looking at me with panic in her eyes.</p> <p>"Do you want me to see you again?" I asked her.</p> <p>She was trying to decide what she wanted to do again but she was also getting scared again.</p> <p>She was wearing white stockings and a suspender belt. She wasn't wearing a top.</p> <p>"Yes." She whispered. The last thing that she wanted was to be with me again.</p> <p>She walked to me. The only thing that I wanted to do was kiss her, to take her to bed again. And to tell her how much I loved her. Then she started taking off her clothes.</p> <p>"Not so fast." I said.</p> <p>"What? Why? Why?" She asked.</p> <p>"Because you might get upset if you see what all goes on around you. I'm not here to make you jealous." I told her.</p> <p>She started unbuttoning her blouse again and I watched it slide away. She didn't look all that scared anymore. She looked like a little girl with a big girl. I don't think that we had the sexual desire to put her in that position.</p> <p>"No, please stop. This is wrong." She said, "I can't. I don't know what I can say!"</p> <p>"Oh, honey, you can say anything you want. Let me kiss you and make sure it's okay." I said, "Go to bed now and make sure it's not any trouble."</p> <p>She started toward the door but I stopped her.</p> <p>"No! Nooo! You have to go! We can't." She said.</p> <p>"I just did." I told her and kissed her on her forehead.</p> <p>She just looked at me and said, "I love you." And I turned and walked away.</p> <p>I think that I will never get over what I did. I've made love to two women over the past couple years as much as I have. No, not about this. But about how I felt about them. That I truly loved them. That I'd love them back and that I would do whatever it took to make them happy. So go ahead and make me feel this way again.</p> <p>As for what happens at the next store when the others leave I'm not saying. I know that I did do it but I'm not sure. I think I like it a lot. It's strange. I don't know what I'm feeling and what it means but whatever it is, it's not really that hard to figure out.</p> <p>But I do think that I should tell you something.</p> <p>This was not just a business meeting. It was the first time I'd been in a public place. When I was there I was in public. Not just standing on a train. I was in a public place.
