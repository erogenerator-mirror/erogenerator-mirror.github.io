She said, as she climbed out of the car and started walking back up.</p> <p>"We're here." I called out as they came in. "Where's your husband?"</p> <p>"I guess he's upstairs. It's almost midnight." She said, and I could tell something was up.</p> <p>"What do you mean it's almost midnight, and everyone's already out?" I asked, and I followed close behind them.</p> <p>"Just a little after midnight. There was no one else around. I think it was just some drunken or drunken party. It's been a couple of hours now. We came in and everyone was in a state of shock for a couple of hours, and you guys have got to be ready for anything."</p> <p>"Yeah, and everything is up and moving as it should have been." I said and we all turned and walked into the house. Just as they were pulling the door open, the first couple left the house and went into the bedroom, which also had a shower and bath. I followed them into the bathroom, where they stepped onto the shower, and started rinsing off after they got out.</p> <p>"Do you know what's going to happen when somebody comes in here?" I asked the water still running in my hands.</p> <p>"No. Not unless it's all over the house. Maybe that'll be the main event for the other couple." She replied, as she got on the shower floor with me and started lathering herself up.</p> <p>"You okay to get out on the floor? I thought we were going to do it the other way." I asked, and she laughed along with me.</p> <p>"Yep, the main event, it's kind of up against the rules. But everyone can do whatever they want." She replied. "And I'm really fine that way now anyway. I'm sorry you guys broke up, but I don't want to see you guys together anymore," she giggled.</p> <p>"We're okay. We'd like it just as much as you do." I said as she turned off the water just then. By the way, if we don't mind saying, we're all clean now!"</p> <p>"I think we did a pretty good job of it yourself." She said dryly, as she stood there, her top still around her waist, her panties still around her ankles, the bottom of her top just around her hips.</p> <p>"I know. I'm sorry." I said, as I reached under the tub and started rubbing the soap on my hands all over my body.</p> <p>"Well, we're all clean now, and I have nothing to stop you from doing whatever you want!" She laughed.</p> <p>"So, you guys are a little worried over how you and I feel about the idea of watching someone else having sex?" I asked with a laugh.</p> <p>"Well, you see us, right?" She said. "We wouldn't be here if it weren't for you." She finished rinsing herself off and stepped out of the stall. I followed close by, washing myself from top to bottom in the same spot. As she was soaping me, I thought again... We took our towel and dried off. We put them in the hamper for me and I went into the bedroom to pull the covers around us, and then we put our own clothes on. We didn't need anything else and we had left our clothes near the hamper by the front door, so nothing was going to break us. It was pretty late and we had the house to ourselves.</p> <p>She turned my head towards her once more.</p> <p>"Don't tell anybody we had sex in the shower, okay? No one else would find out anyway." She smiled at me, and I smiled back with her. She walked back into the bedroom and grabbed the towel off the side of the bed, but didn't start to dry herself off, so I followed her to the bedroom closet and pulled out the top of the dryer. I tossed my clothes inside.</p> <p>We were now both naked as a jay, and the room was dark, so I didn't hear any sounds coming from the closet. I took the towel, wrapped it around my waist and went into the closet, where I opened the door and pulled it open. When I did, a light came on from what appeared to be a closet door and I could smell a strong odor of perfume and something else.</p> <p>There was a bed spread on which there was a mirror. There was a mirror, and some sort of a bed stand. It was probably made for someone, and although it didn't look like the best that I could imagine, I could pretty sure it was a night stand, to start with. There were some other clothes scattered all over, on the bed next to where I was laying.
