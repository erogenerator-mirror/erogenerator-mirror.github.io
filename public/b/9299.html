Is you coming in to get some food? You still haven't seen me in five days, and I don't feel like a snack."</p> <p>"Nope, we're just getting ready to take a trip out to see old friends."</p> <p>"Oh, right. Well, I better go get dressed, and then I got to run you a quick bubble bath."</p> <p>"Oh. Yeah, okay."</p> <p>I grabbed my bathing suit and walked into the kitchen. I stopped dead in the kitchen and froze, unable to move or speak before I heard the door open.</p> <p>"What the hell's going on?" I could barely make out her body move, but couldn't tell her voice clearly. I don't know if I could have breathed if I had been wearing anything.</p> <p>I turned around on the spot and froze, unable to move or speak. Now that I was even partially a foot away, she was in front of me blocking my vision with her body, and the look in her eyes told me that she wanted me to back up now. I froze, afraid that she knew I was paralyzed, but she couldn't move. I tried to walk away, but I couldn't run. She moved, and I couldn't move. She moved and I started to turn away.</p> <p>"Come on. Don't be silly. You know you want to be my friend." She said as she reached around me, took my hand, and led me to the couch, all four feet of it. I was scared, and I did my best to get myself out of the situation.</p> <p>"We've seen each other, right?" She asked.</p> <p>"Right. But we don't know, yet." I replied quickly, fearing rejection myself.</p> <p>There were a number of people around us, and the room was crowded. Most people were wearing suits, and a lot of people were wearing suits. No one was whispering or talking, but there was no need to, as any attempt was lost in the noise that emanated from the room and it made no difference.</p> <p>"So, do you want to be my friend?" She asked, with a seductive look on her face.</p> <p>"I don't know, but I have an idea. I'll talk to the guys later about it." I quickly put my thoughts to the idea, and went back to the kitchen.</p> <p>"Honey, I can't do this. My feelings really don't have anything to do with the situation. I know we can't go out with those guys, and that's how people like us treat our girlfriends."</p> <p>"Honey, please don't say that to me." I said. That wasn't what she was expecting, and she had to know that.</p> <p>"I don't care what you say. I just want to be your friend. I want to do everything you say, and I'm not willing to do that because I don't know what will happen if I agree...if you don't agree, and if that means we can't get married."</p> <p>What? That was pretty lame.</p> <p>"Okay. I can think of no alternative." She said.</p> <p>"Ok. Then I'll talk to the guys; we'll figure out a way." I nodded and left to my own doom. She was right; we couldn't agree to things now. The thought of that being okay was still so foreign.</p> <p>When I got home, I started putting on my clothes as I told my parents that they'd be pissed if they knew what had happened, and I was too excited from working all day to talk about it.</p> <p>In the meantime, Becky got a good workout on Saturday following the party on Saturday night and on Sunday morning after she got out of bed. She put her panties on the bed next to me, and crawled in her sleep. We laid there, spooning, and she started to move her hand up and down my body slowly, stopping occasionally to run her fingers across my chest or my nipple.</p> <p>"Mmm, sweetie. You look so lovely when you sleep like this. I can't believe how beautiful you are." She said slowly, seductively, and after a few moments, she was all over me. She kissed me lightly, and I didn't pull away.</p> <p>"You really do have a sexy body, baby. I love watching your breasts sway as you move them in rhythm to our lovemaking, and I love feeling your soft skin against my body." I whispered.</p> <p>"That's sweet to say, but you know I had your dick last night. You should feel how hard I get for you." She said softly. We made slow love for a while, before we had to stop.</p> <p>She had a little trouble getting me to wake up by rolling onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
