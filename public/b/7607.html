He asked, confused.</p> <p>"It's a little late, isn't it?" she said. How could she not have known where he was and why didn't he stop, if only to remind her of him? she thought! He sat on the edge of her bed. "I came in to talk to you, Miss... "Sandra, please call me Sandra," he said. "I don't understand!" she said, "What's wrong?" "I don't know what to answer to you, but..." he stopped. "I know what you're doing. Where'd you come from, and where are you from?" "I'm from a place called the Garden of Eden." "We grew up together, believe it or not." "I see," she said. "The Garden of Eden? What did you call it, young lady?" "I'm not your mother." "But I did!" he insisted. "I see, but not in the same way that you would if you were of legal age." "No, I mean, no, that's not what you meant!" he said. He raised his right hand to her and she suddenly realized that he was holding her braided red hair back. Her body instinctively reached for him.</p> <p>"I was telling you, I don't like that!" He said, reaching down and pulling her to him. "I want to be with you, not as your mommy, but I don't want to be like that." His left arm came down and covered her shoulder as he sat up. "Oh, baby, don't worry about that. Where are the other girls?' He looked at her and grinned. For a second, she looked unsure and yet incredibly excited and at him. "Just where did ya mean?" "I meant where I was from. Where is your house, exactly?" "I don't remember the house. I think it's right across the street. I'm going to have to move." "No!" he pushed her away and she was suddenly angry. "This isn't about you? I'm sorry if that makes you feel bad. Please don't think that I'm a stupid-ass like you. I think being with you has made me realize that I'm your little girl. I feel that my feelings are too personal for me to be happy with just another girl. I don't really love you, or love you as your mother, but I love you. You shouldn't be afraid anymore. I don't want to hurt you if that makes you feel better." "Please, Sandra, I really don't know if I'm right. I want to be with you. Please tell me that. I was just worried about you before, I guess I'd gotten a shock. If I hadn't... I don't know if I'm a slut or something. I'm still trying to work out how and why I'm trying to be with you." "You have nothing to be ashamed of, baby. You're not a slut. I love it when you're upset or sad. I don't mean to, but I find you very attractive." He had his left arm around her, and Sandra's right arm was wrapped around his neck, almost holding his head while his left rested on her shoulder. His right hand had found her small breast and was stroking and caressing her left nipple through her shirt. Her body was pressing against him like she had done so many times before. Sandra wasn't thinking about what was happening here anymore, just that her body was feeling very, very good. "I know, I am just sorry that I can't be with you, Sandra," he said. "Besides, I can't do what mommy needs right now, and it's no biggy here. How about we try one day and see what happens?" He turned her back to him and she had to go into the bathroom to get her braids back. "Sandra, let me go, and you can go back over there." She looked up at him and they stared into each other's eyes for a long time. She smiled back at him and he leaned forward and gave her a soft, gentle kiss. She loved it. Her heart skipped a beat, and a tiny smile broke across her face. He had been watching her; she was sitting on the edge of the bed, her skirt up around her waist, just inches from his face. He was breathing hard, and she could plainly see his excitement. She reached down and slowly unbuttoned her blouse. The feeling of her small breasts and hard nipples against his chest were incrediblyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
