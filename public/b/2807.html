I could not stop wondering where this night would lead.</p> <p>The one guy I saw in the crowd that had come in at that time had just left me standing there with my panties around my thighs.</p> <p>He said, "There isn't much else to do. I'm sorry I couldn't offer you a chance like he did. I hope you can be with me that night and be my special girl."</p> <p>The other guy then had a huge grin on his face and he looked at me. "Oh you sexy girl, I really hope you can be one of my special girls. I have a big surprise here for you that I want you to have tonight and I would very much enjoy it having you."</p> <p>I smiled at that and he winked at me before looking back at the other guys and saying, "See I told you I was on my way to see you."</p> <p>Both the others laughed at that and a couple of them looked around the table asking all kinds of questions and comments for what seemed like an age.</p> <p>I looked over at them again before I turned and walked out of the room.</p> <p>I couldn't believe I was actually going to do this. I had gone from having a great time being a cheerleader to being my girlfriend for the next four years.</p> <p>My panties were soaked and I had the whole world to myself tonight.</p> <p>I went and got my overnight bag from the room and walked out of the bathroom with the group of men with me standing next to him as he looked at me.</p> <p>They all had huge smiles on their faces as I walked toward them and the look of sexual hunger in their eyes.</p> <p>I walked up to them and they all looked over at me at that moment and I looked over at them and saw that they were just smiling at me and I leaned over and kissed him on the cheek. I told him that I needed to leave and that I couldn't wait to see him again.</p> <p>He smiled at me and said, "Don't worry about me, I'll show you later on tonight."</p> <p>I kissed him on the cheek and told him I had a surprise to surprise you guys.</p> <p>We all watched each other disappear into the room and all the other guys left me standing there.</p> <p>I was looking over at them and when I saw that they were just making comments about how horny I was going to be and how much I wanted the night to go on.</p> <p>They were all staring at me and I was beginning to think that it couldn't end as quickly as I did.</p> <p>My heart was beating like crazy as I walked out of the room with them all following me.</p> <p>I looked at my husband and he was standing there smiling with the others just staring at me as me, just standing there, looking over at them, but not talking to me, not even touching me.</p> <p>I didn't know what to do or what to do next. I looked over at the other guys still at the same stage of arousal and they all were smiling as if watching me in the other direction and they couldn't wait.</p> <p>I turned to walk towards Mark's table and he said, "Oh my, where did youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
