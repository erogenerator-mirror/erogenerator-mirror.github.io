She started to feel nervous as he walked up behind her, her nipples were straining against her shirt, and she was so wet she could already feel how wet her vagina walls were. She didn't even realize she was shaking, and her arms fell to her sides slightly, leaving her nipples hard, and even the slight breeze caused them to dance in the nape of her neck, pushing her breasts against the hot, damp terrain. The trail was too short for her to climb it up, and she was stuck here until he got away with something, leaving her to make the hike to her car in the dark.</p> <p>By this time, she was afraid, and she was glad he wouldn't take anything back, he didn't care, he walked her all the way to her car, and as she climbed in on her hands and knees towards the front for the drive back to his dorm, she turned to face him and whispered in his ear, "Come on. I don't really have much choice. Let's go."</p> <p>As they moved out of the forest with her arm hanging down the side of the car, the small creek in front of them led off down a small ravine. The grass was not very densely woods like the main part of the forest, but it was a natural, soft, and warm, and the grass was lush and fragrant against her bare thighs. She shivered at the thought that she was being used for his pleasure and his pleasure alone, and just as that thought crossed her mind, she felt his legs open as he moved into the clearing in front of her and she felt his cock, already semi-erect. He pushed the cover-cloth under his own bottom and took his clothes off, then she felt his hands on her hips as he lifted her, guiding her to the edge of the grass.</p> <p>Once they were situated on their knees in the open, he pulled her shirt up and over her head as she felt the cool grass on her chest, and then he reached around her and unhooked her bra, which dropped on the ground as he bent to remove her shorts. The cool grass tickled her bare chest as she felt the warm, wet grass touching all over her legs as she felt his hands move from the small of her back to the small of her back again, and then to her ass, then up her thighs, and back down her legs, starting again on her feet. She couldn't tell the distance from her back with the sun, but she had no idea how long he was going to be there, if he had the time to wait, if he had some way to be back before he got there. She wasn't sure her legs would be able to support her weight because of how high it was, but it was not easy to keep up on her feet with him holding her like that.</p> <p>"Where do you want me?" he asked, as his hands moved to her shoulders and he pulled her close to him and kissed her while he kept the weight of his body close on top of hers. Just as he moved back after what seemed like hours of holding her, she heard the soft, rhythmic sound of him zipping his own jeans up and her breasts brushed his thigh as they broke the kiss. Her nipples were hard and her vagina was swollen with lust and she reached around him to pull the zipper down on his jeans. He pulled his belt free of the loops of his jeans and began to unbutton his shirt, before pulling his shirt off to reveal his chest, and her hands started to stroke his chest and his arms as he pushed the shirt down and reached behind her to start to unclasp her bra. She felt his hands on her nipples, teasing her, and then she felt hands on her breasts at the same time as her nipples were pulled and pinched.</p> <p>"Oh God! Oh God!" she thought, "Oh God! Oh God!" he thought, "I'm going to cum!" She felt his hands on her hips, and then his cock pressed against her and she felt his hardness inside of her. It felt hot and hard, and somehow she was not quite sure if it would be as big and hard as it would be when he was inside of her, and even if that was his intent, it felt big, and even though he had a big hard cock inside of her, he didn't force her onto the grass! She wanted to reach back and slide it in for herself, but she didn't want to be pushed into the grass and run away or even to be pushed into the forest or to be forced into the same position that she'd been. She felt his hands pulling hers down, pushing her over to the back of the blanket, as he pushed himself in behind her, and she felt his cock at the entrance of her vagina.</p> <p>She feltâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
