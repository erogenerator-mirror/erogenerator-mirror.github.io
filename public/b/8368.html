She'd be coming back late from dropping some more things off, but I made the excuse that the guys were at work, and would be home before long. My only problem with my schedule was my friend at work. She worked in sales as an associate and had asked me to work with her. She was really helpful and we began talking. She told me about the job, her husband, my life, and I told her about my work.</p> <p>I asked her about all of her life. She said that she came from a small town in Utah with her own family. I asked her if there was more information that I should know. She said that we did everything that we could in Utah, and she didn't care for the "wild men who went to Utah and did everything for free."</p> <p>I'd have told her that the thing she was really interested in was our sex life. She was very interested, I think, but I couldn't put it into words. It was difficult with those things being in the dark, and it showed in the weather. That might not have been the most common fantasy, but she didn't mind at all when it was a bit rough. I knew that my mouth was dry and I could barely think and I had to sit. I had a couple more drinks and got ready to go when she said, "You know, you and my husband have a lot in common."</p> <p>She leaned over, put a kiss to my lips, and said, "Yes I know."</p> <p>We started out walking arm in arm to the park area. The park area was very, very secluded, but it wasn't the sort of place that most of the other folks went.</p> <p>I asked her, "Is your husband with me?" She looked at her husband, and his face was a little flushed and embarrassed.</p> <p>"Yes" she said. "We've been married for ten years." She smiled at me and said. "I was married for almost six and I have a son now that he's almost three." She smiled at my husband who was looking more distressed and embarrassed than anything else.</p> <p>"What was that all about?" she asked.</p> <p>"Well, it sort of started with my neighbor, Sarah. She's kind of a bitch." I said.</p> <p>"How long is she like this?" She asked and then looked me in the eye.</p> <p>"I don't know, all I know is that we started working almost together, but it was at a company picnic in Yellowstone. She says that most everyone that worked there knew that. I guess they think that we were like kids."</p> <p>She was looking directly at me, she put her hand on my thigh. As she did that there were just no words. Her leg reached up and brushed mine. I looked down and she looked even more so.</p> <p>I got a little uneasy when she said, "That's it is for a first time, you're new and in unfamiliar territory."</p> <p>"I'll be happy to share that with someone, " I said smiling.</p> <p>I thought that it was an unusual comment. I was a little apprehensive, and maybe I was just drunk. But I liked it very much and it made me feel good.</p> <p>I said, "Maybe you're right. Maybe our marriage is not as perfect as friends, maybe it's better in a different way.</p> <p>We started walking and she leaned in over again. She grabbed my hands, turned me around and said, "How do you feel about the way the sun looks on the ocean, your hair is down. Does it bother you that I'm nude?"</p> <p>"Not at all," I said, I just don't know what it's about that color that's more interesting to me."</p> <p>We made our way through the darkness and she said, "It's beautiful in the darkness. Do you want to go back to the hotel?"</p> <p>"I don't see any problem with having dinner with you, I really do."</p> <p>"Well I really do," I said.</p> <p>She took my hand and kissed it. "Let's make it another date." She was looking into my eyes. She put her hand on my cheek and looked into my eyes again. She licked her lips and said, "I have to admit that you got the most beautiful thing in the world, "that's why I'm doing all the work."</p> <p>"The sex is exciting," I said.</p> <p>"Do you feel like we have a future together?" She said. "That's it, the first part is over."</p> <p>She looked and me and smiled. She said, "The second part is almost over."</p> <p>I looked at the clock on the wall and saw it was almost 8:00pm.
