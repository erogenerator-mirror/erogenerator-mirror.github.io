"This is one that you may never see." "It's a gift from my God, I hope," I insisted.</p> <p>She started to pull up her panties. "If you'd like you can take them off, but there's really no need." She hesitated for a second. "Here," she said handing the front of her panties to me. "I don't think I'll need this anymore after." She turned around. My heart sank.</p> <p>"I guess I should have asked first..." I said thinking that I might not have the words. But I needed to see. In that brief moment I realized that this was the final step of my transformation from the innocent innocent high school sweetheart to a raging hard on.</p> <p>She stood up and grabbed me in a bear hug, "Now how was your flight..." she started. She took my face between her hands and kissed me. It was very passionate and hot. I was stunned. Then I felt like a virgin being kissed and not the next step in my transformation.</p> <p>"We'll have to have a talk later," she said. "Now, how can I help you?"</p> <p>"I don't know. What is the right time? Where will I go?" "Let's check the reservation," she said. She pointed to a sign, "There is a small motel that will be right next to my car. This way, there's no one in the parking lot." So, we decided to go to the motel. I was a little shaky.</p> <p>"Well, I'll let you drive so that you can check the fuel, as well as the directions." She turned her back to me and walked to the motel.</p> <p>I walked to the door that she stopped, opened the car door and got out. She looked in the window, then smiled. "You should have," she said. "Now we can get to bed."</p> <p>I watched her walk away in her heels, her perfect ass swaying from side to side. I had completely lost control.</p> <p>I sat down in the car and started the engine. I had no idea how to respond but I would find out soon enough.</p> <p>She walked to the motel, got in and started to get undressed. "Where to?" she asked. "I have a suite right up the highway." "I'll call ahead and get us a room while you change." "We can use my room," she added. She handed me her credit card. "It makes it so that I can go to the bathroom at the same time as you," she said.</p> <p>"What bathroom?" "We have the one just down the road. We have the room right next to mine." She looked around the motel. "Is there anything else you'd like?" she said.</p> <p>"Not really," I answered. "I'm going to drive." "I'm going to take a shower. How about we stop in at the motel on our way to sleep?" "It's about 10:30, it's late." She turned to me in the headlights. "I'm sure that the way the traffic is, you can find a shower if you want." I pulled over and pulled out my credit card. She smiled at me as she pulled away, then started getting undressed. I didn't say anything, I just stared in the rearview mirror. She had removed her bra, panties and heels and was standing in a dark room. I watched as she reached around and unhooked her bra, then let it slip off, then bent over the car so that I could get my hand between her legs. She was already very wet but I began to massage her outer lips through her panties. They were smooth and hot and she started to breathe heavily. I put one hand behind her to steady her and the other began to rub her clit. I was surprised. I certainly had never seen anything as beautiful as this. It took every fiber of my mind to keep from cumming right there at the same time.</p> <p>This is what my body needed right then. My cock was throbbing in my pants. I felt my heart pound in my chest. I was afraid that I might give a heart attack. I had a raging hard on in my pants.</p> <p>She turned around to me, opened the door, took her clothes off, then sat on the bed. I stood there with my mouth hanging open for a long time and stared at her for quite a long time. She reached over and touched my face before pushing me down.</p> <p>"I'm going to do you a great favor," she said. I looked in her eyes. They were wide with desire. I felt the need build more. She got off the bed, walked across and turned on a night light which was next to the door. She opened the door. "Turn around," she saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
