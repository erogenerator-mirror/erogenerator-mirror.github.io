Why don't you try it on?"</p> <p>I pulled on my pants, and my top, and put on the top. I looked at the back; my favorite color - pink, of course. "Wow... you are very pretty in color. I couldn't have done it better with a better pair of blue eyes."</p> <p>"Thanks. The only thing you need to do here is put on a pair of your pants. Try the jacket. It looks good on you."</p> <p>"What would you mind if I tried a couple pairs? You know, take good care of me."</p> <p>"That's not fair. Your bottom gets an occasional smack for that," she laughed. "There are some nice things in the top of the closet besides these, you might want to keep these. You can put on a good suit later."</p> <p>"You sure? You might need a belt, or something to go with it."</p> <p>"No belt! I am going to turn into a sexy nurse!" she joked. We both laughed.</p> <p>She grabbed my hand and dragged me to the closet. I heard the door click, and the lock click. She dragged me down the hallway. There was only darkness and silence. She stopped in her bedroom, and pulled me up. "I will be right back." I heard her shoes on the hard tile floor as she removed her sweater. I knew what she wanted. She was in the middle of a huge bed. "Take that off." I stripped my suit, and climbed on the bed, to feel her thighs against mine. Her soft breasts rubbing against my chest. Her fingers touching my shoulder blades.</p> <p>"You are so nice," she moaned. She ran her fingers down my arm, leaving one finger in my right palm. She ran her other hand slowly down my chest, her tongue licking my lips. I looked down at her lips, and saw a devil of a smile on them. She slowly moved her head down to kiss the side of my left breast, her hand caressing my nipple. I could have moved, I could have moaned. But I didn't. Instead, I lifted my hips. She moved my skirt up to feel my crotch with her hand, and then started to stroke my clit. I was ready to explode, and almost lost it.</p> <p>I moved my hips up, and she quickly moved her mouth to my nipple. She was using magic on my breasts, and I let it grow in her mouth as she sucked and nibbled. She slowly pushed me down; I sat on the bed and raised her legs. I kissed each thigh, and then slid her panties down.</p> <p>My tongue darted out and circled my tongue around her lips. I was about to kiss her, when she was completely opened to me.</p> <p>She reached her hands behind her to grab each of my head with both hands, forcing her down onto my mouth. I licked the tip of one, then she placed the other one at my nipple. I continued to play, while I felt her tongue inside me. Her moans were constant; her kisses were forceful.</p> <p>"Oh... I need you. I need you so bad!" she demanded. She pushed my face deep into her, and held my face against hers for a long hard kiss. I felt her pussy muscles squeeze my tongue then release it. I continued to play until she relaxed from her orgasm.</p> <p>I moved up to her, and sat on her. Her hands grasped my breasts, her eyes closed as I felt how hard she was. "You're so beautiful, like a goddess. I have missed you," she purred. I looked at her face, and could see her smile. She reached one hand down, and pushed into my slit through my underwear. It felt so good. My legs opened slightly, and she rubbed her fingers softly, then deeper. I moaned, and pushed, and moaned a little deeper. She felt hot, and wet, and I could feel her juices running down my leg.</p> <p>She was really turned on tonight, as was I, and we both knew it. "I have not cum that hard in a long time," she groaned, moving down to kiss me. I kissed and licked her breasts and nipples as she made love to me. She wanted it now, I knew.</p> <p>She rolled me onto my back, and positioned herself over me. I lifted my hips, and her pussy pressed on it. She slowly lowered herself onto me, and let her weight take all of me into her. My arms went around her and held her. She started to ride me slowly, letting me feel the sensation of all around us.</p> <p>Her hips were rocking up and down, and I let my hands rest on her buttocks.
