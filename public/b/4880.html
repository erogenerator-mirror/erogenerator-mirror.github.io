As my finger slips back into your pussy again, you let out a soft gasp, your hand on my body as you press my arm towards you. My whole arm, my arm, the whole area of my body, my fingertips, my palm, the fingers of my other hand, my face - up to your neck - all the way up to your chin - and I feel my entire arm disappear. You can feel my hand as I slide it all the way to the base, and you gasp again as you arch your back again as I begin to stroke you with my hand. It feels like you are trying to get me up to speed, to take me deeper inside you. The fingers inside you are getting tired, but in the meantime, your body is taking its own pleasure.</p> <p>Our position leaves me completely in your lap, my legs wide apart as I recline back against you. My hand is now inside you, stroking you, stroking your inner walls as your hand is in mine. But it's a different kind of pleasure, and it was nothing like what had taken you, it was just a feeling of you being very turned on and needing more. And it never had really been something we had done many times before, but I now was just feeling that you were enjoying it, of not just my hand in yours at this moment, but also of me as well. As I continue stroking inside you, you feel my fingers start to slide in and out of you again, and feel a little jolt of bliss as these two things together make you feel. I am stroking you inside as my fingers go in and out, slowly at first, until you feel another orgasm building... and then it becomes a sort of an aftertaste in your body. After several moments, when you come down, I slowly pull my hand out of your vagina, and then turn my fingers over to you. You are ready again, and I let you lie back down with me, pulling your legs up further as I reach back between your legs and slide my hand up along your thigh, then back down, and across your belly.</p> <p>I look at you, eyes closed, fingers between your legs, your stomach arched and your face up towards the ceiling as you moan softly into the pillow. I start to touch you again, gently, to start stroking you gently, to stroke your lips but not on any of your areas. I run my fingers along the outside now, and then up around your clit which you are so sensitive at, and slowly and gently rub, all the while looking into your eyes as the pleasure courses through you. Your eyes are still closed, as I continue to work my finger up and down inside you with each pass, slowly in and out of you. I let my thumb slide over the tip, and then slide it down between your lips, finding your clit as I slid it back up inside you to your left-handed center, where I begin to circle it lightly with my thumb. I lean down and kiss your mouth again, my lips sliding down onto yours as my tongue slides in and out of your mouth. Your hands wrap around mine, pulling it closer as my fingers begin caressing the outside of your vagina, making you arch it, pulling my hand towards you...</p> <p>Your hips start to arch slightly as I slide my hand over your clit and up into you... pressing down on it with my thumb. Still stroking you, it doesn't take long before your back arches once again, and you let out a moan, your arms tightening around me as you start thrusting against me. I can't tell if it is because of the heat of your orgasm or the feelings of my fingers inside you, because I never stop stroking you, my fingers stroking in and out, up and down, stroking gently at first but now picking up pace as your moans start to get louder and louder, as I continue stroking in and out. I bring my free hand up to my mouth, and I gently suck at your nipple, then pull it gently back into your breast, and I bite it, then slowly, gently suck the whole nipple into my mouth, flicking my tongue over it to make sure it's fully hard and still-sensitive inside. I move my hand to your clit again, but start just stroking it as the orgasm starts again in your mouth. I stop and lean down to kiss your mouth, feeling the muscles in your neck ripple and relax as you come down from the pleasure that washes over you. I let my breath out into your mouth and gently slide out of you, so I have my cock back, rubbing up against your clit as I move away, and I kiss your forehead as I lay next to you, my arm around you, my hand sliding on your back as I kiss you gently, aching to be insideâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
