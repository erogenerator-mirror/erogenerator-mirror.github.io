I'd already come. I'd already cheated at work. I'd taken her and then fucked her twice for the sake of getting her back to my place on her fourteenth birthday. I was just going to lie.</p> <p>After all this, how much more to I ask? How much more to actually do?</p> <p>That didn't really matter. I was going to get out of the house. There was a small amount of time that we'd still have to be together, if only to keep the house and the money separate. I just had to go back to the house and figure out how to move it to the right location. I'd even have to get rid of the house. It would have to be a small apartment, but it was a large one. It might take another ten to ten years to get a decent sized one, and a small one would only get in the way of a good apartment. But it would be a nice place to live in, and, the first few years out of town would be a nice place.</p> <p>And I just had to figure out how to move the apartment out. I just had to figure things out.</p> <p>"You've got to be kidding me."</p> <p>"No, my stupid girlfriend thinks all you have to do is lie. How are we supposed to work out if we're all the same? We are all just friends. I need a good job. I need a woman to come home to. I need a good job. But we're all the same."</p> <p>"Bullshit," I said. I knew that this wouldn't be like anything that I'd ever been with, but not when I looked at her. The feeling that I should give her a good recommendation was so bad that I wasn't really able to tell her in confidence, but I just had to see, just talk with her. She still had some weight to it, but I figured that we'd have to settle for that. What would she think if she could have a good job, and was able to live relatively well? If the economy didn't improve quickly, and someone did the things they had, and just left them on a shelf in a jewelry box, and I went around town, trying not to think that there were problems.</p> <p>It was a big leap for me to make. I could never have had a job. That was just a part of the problem. It was only a part of the problem. She couldn't have a job, and then I was stuck in that apartment with a mortgage on my life. So I just walked out the door, and I just went with the flow. The situation, the situation, might have seemed simple to her if she hadn't been so stubborn. She could have been all over me for all the trouble I'd caused. And then you'd know that my problem was hers, mine was hers, and mine was all mine. I don't think that all the problems that I caused her to have were mine.</p> <p>It was the third and final weekend in September, and the week had grown too busy to start with. There were many days that I was there for her and the nights she was gone. Some nights she was. One night I was there for her the night before her birthday. I would stay the night at her home. I would spend the night there with her if she was all that she said she would be. My friend and I had a big birthday celebration for her. The three of us were going to have a big orgy. We had sex with lots of different partners from the girls to the guys. Not only would I be her toy, the guys would be on the lookout for a good shot of her.</p> <p>The other two nights she had to work, and we could watch a movie. I'd had several. I decided that if she'd be there for three nights of sex we'd both be naked and we'd have two nights like that, and maybe even three or four more if she kept going.</p> <p>And the girls had been there a half an hour, and then her and I weren't there anymore. I didn't think that there was any more time that we could do anything, so I was relieved that I wasn't alone. I wondered if she was even thinking about my having sex with her friends. It would have made a difference to the situation anyway. She didn't have to know. That's why I wouldn't bring it up.</p> <p>"I am going to go," I said. I looked around the house. "I just want to go on my way. It's only about the third night."</p> <p>After she had cleaned the house, and she'd cooked dinner, I'd spent the evening in the library and studying. Sometimes I'd sit in my study with my friends, and sometimes I'd walk over to my sister's house and stay for the evening.
