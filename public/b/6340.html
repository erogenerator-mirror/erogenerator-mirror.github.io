You can leave your bra on, if you want."</p> <p>Beth, who was still holding my cock, looked over at her and said, "I guess I'll just have to leave your bra in the bathroom."</p> <p>"Why don't you give it to him?"</p> <p>"No," Beth replied. "Leave it on because I know that he likes that, too."</p> <p>Beth got off the bench and dropped into the grass beside him.</p> <p>"Here," she said, handing me the nipple clamps. "I can use this on you myself."</p> <p>"Oh, no thanks. I can just hold on to them."</p> <p>When I reached a sitting position in front of him I took hold of the clamps just as he had mine on the night before.</p> <p>"Oh, look who's talking!" he exclaimed, trying to reach over and touch me.</p> <p>"Please, no touching!"</p> <p>I squeezed the clamps to make the blood rush back to my cock. As soon as they began to come off, they started sucking on my nipples again.</p> <p>"Ohhhh," I exclaimed, holding Beth and trying to pull her body against mine.</p> <p>"I can't take anymore! Please, you don't have to do this," she said, trying to get close to me.</p> <p>While the clamps were off, the first time he started touching me with my own body, I couldn't help but feel guilty. I could feel myself getting weak with excitement.</p> <p>Beth was pulling the straps back on the strap. When it came off, I pulled Beth's face close to mine and she quickly started kissing me. He nipples, again, were very erect by the time they were removed.</p> <p>When he stopped kissing Beth, he got dressed.</p> <p>"That was great," said Beth, when, after he had put his shirt on, he left, with his face still close to mine.</p> <p>"Well, I'm glad you could enjoy it, David.," I said.</p> <p>"No problem, you're great," he said, smiling.</p> <p>"But, I can tell it was wrong."</p> <p>"I guess we're not quite finished. Can we just go back and try again tomorrow? That's a date if you get my drift."</p> <p>"OK," he conceded a little. "But I'm afraid of what we're going to do tomorrow."</p> <p>"I'm sure that I understand," I assured him. "But, I know one thing for sure. We don't have to do this again tomorrow. It was fantastic, but I just need to go home now."</p> <p>I handed him a tissue as he left, and saw his cock start to come back to life.</p> <p>"I'm sorry about how we're treating my little friend," I said. "I guess I really can't blame you since you're married."</p> <p>"Not at all. I just never knew that it was that good."</p> <p>I helped Beth to her feet, helped her to her clothes, and took her home. When she got into her car and headed home, I drove us to my apartment.</p> <p>"We're going home to see what's going to transpire tomorrow," I assured her.</p> <p>"I'm afraid that this is way more than a date. I can't believe our situation is coming to this. I hope that your friend will be OK with it."</p> <p>"I'll just have to see if my friend is ready."</p> <p>It did work, I told myself, I just might get lucky today.</p> <p>"What are you going to do now," she asked when she saw me approaching her car. "If I agree to my next appointment, will you come and see me later?"</p> <p>When I got to the apartment, I noticed that she had not locked the door since her husband's truck was still there when she had left.</p> <p>"I thought that you would have gotten home before I. I hope you don't mind."</p> <p>When she asked me whether I thought I would like to see her again, it looked like she was thinking about it too.</p> <p>"Just come in when you are ready," I said. "You've been gone for more than two hour."</p> <p>She stepped inside, locking the door.</p> <p>I noticed that her blouse was open, and I reached up under her bra and fondled her breast again.</p> <p>She gasped in fright and said, "Let's try another position," she said, dropping onto the couch. I quickly unbuttoned and unzipped her jeans, and tugged them down so that I could see her naked bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
