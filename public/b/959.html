I want him to stop. But I can't.</p> <p>I can see he's about to give up and I look to my mom, and she isn't moving.</p> <p>"Mom, we have to stop this," I am trying to stop.</p> <p>All at once she stops and my eyes go wide open.</p> <p>"Let me up," is all she says, so I move my hand and stand up. I go to the bathroom and look, I don't see anything, it's dark, but it could be a lamp on my bedside table. I quickly go upstairs, to my room, to my bed. And find him still leaning out of the bathroom, watching me.</p> <p>"Why did you do it, what did you do?"</p> <p>"We don't have to do anything, I don't need to." I pull his hand, he's trying to get away again but I'm too strong.</p> <p>"Maybe later," I smile, I feel him again grab the towel and wrap it around me. They're still there, but only a small towel came off.</p> <p>"But mom, we have to stop."</p> <p>"Let's stop this right now," I say as I turn back. I can't move because he's holding the towel in one hand. I've wanted to be with him for so long this moment.</p> <p>"That wasn't fair! I don't want to wait," he says as he holds the towel tight to my back. I'm scared of what his reaction would be, what what he'd have to do if I had just stopped. I'm also scared of giving in to everything and everything, just to get out of this little situation.</p> <p>"I just don't want everything to get out of hand." He gives me a sad smile again, his hand still holding the towel in my back. I feel it slowly relax a little and then slip from my butt. I can feel it slide down my butt and back up. He can't help but grab a hold of my butt and rub against it. His hand starts sliding around on my lower back. He pushes it gently so I can feel it sliding a little closer to my skin.</p> <p>"Let me up," I say, it's hard to say to him when his hand is moving around on me. "Please, let me up."</p> <p>"Do...do you want this to stop?" he asks softly.</p> <p>"Yes, I don't see why we have to stop," I say in a small voice.</p> <p>"Mom, you're going a little too hard on yourself, we have to." His words are cold and hard.</p> <p>"Please," I say.</p> <p>He's got me to agree to do something so I don't give it up any time soon. "We have to stop this," I say softly.</p> <p>"Ok, let's hope it doesn't end," he says in a soft voice.</p> <p>"We have to take a chance," I say as I pick up the towel.</p> <p>"It's ok," he says softly. I throw the towel in my hand and I stand up.</p> <p>"It's ok," he says.</p> <p>I walk around to the other side, and when I get there to my door, I turn and look at him.</p> <p>"No, wait a second."</p> <p>He takes the towel and starts drying my back, looking at me as I sit back down and put my shirt on, but instead of the towel hanging down between us, instead he's reaching in between my legs and pulling it back up. I close my legs and he starts to towel me a different way. He is trying to get the sides of my shorts up so he can get at what's underneath but I pull them on.</p> <p>He starts to pull at them again and I stop him. "Leave them down and get them dry. Don't do anything funny, don't say anything, don't talk about anything, just get them down as fast as you can." I can't go back to him, but I don't want to just stand up.</p> <p>"Alright," he says in a soft voice, as if nothing happened. "That's nice to know."</p> <p>"I'm going back," I say softly. When I turn and leave him, I open my arms and he follows me to the bathroom. He pushes me to the toilet, where there's only a small amount of paper on the toilet.</p> <p>"Sit down, I don't give a damn about the towel," he says.</p> <p>"Don't ask questions, just go to the toiletâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
