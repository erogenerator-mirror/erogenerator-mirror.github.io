She would be in college and then would head for college. The only things she was able to do were to study and do her internship for her new job, now they were two long weeks and then they would be back home.</p> <p>During those two weeks Amanda's thoughts had been on the past, today that she knew in order to meet Alex, she would be in her new position. He was going to be staying with her for two nights this week, but he would be working from the beginning, as always. Amanda had a lot of ideas, some of them were very good and others they were all very bad. Today she was going to have her first adventure, she didn't know how, but she trusted Alex and knew there would be some great fun ahead, especially on this day! A week ago, Amanda had decided to spend the week with her new friend. It was not to be a weekend at home. It was to be a two-week vacation for Alex at his new school. Amanda decided this wasn't the day to set the stage, as it had been since the last time she'd been on her own and could still make the trip. She had thought she was going to be alone, but instead she turned to her friend and whispered a quick goodbye.</p> <p>Amanda had a strange feeling that Alex really loved her, she wanted to see if she was real and if this night would ever make them even closer in one night. She smiled and hugged her friend, remembering every second of their first encounter. Amanda was a quick study, never had sex with anyone that she was not willing to spend the next two nights as her first conquest, but once she found the first of many more memorable things she wanted to do, there wasn't an option to stay that long. Amanda's mind was made up, she didn't care if he slept with her but only if he slept with people she trusted and trusted. It was as simple as that, what did it matter if Alex slept with her?</p> <p>Amanda walked back to her room, she changed into her night attire, a pair of panties and a bra, she put on her makeup and looked for a pair of earrings. She decided on a thin red ribbon-cut off skirt that buttoned down the left side that had been left undone on her waist. She had gone on vacation to the Bahamas to start with, to see what the weather would be like. When she was wearing it her ass would stick it's way out but would remain firm and flat as she walked. Amanda finished with a pair of short red heels and went to the counter of the local beauty salon to be had. She couldn't believe how sexy she looked, she had changed clothes just enough to show off her perfect legs, but it wasn't just how she was dressed, there were more curves, she was a little bit more voluptuous. She also realized how small her breasts were and that they didn't look so big to start with, they were at least a B cup. Her nipples were always being teased by her bra and sometimes even a little bit when she was walking. Amanda was wearing a red satin blouse that came only half in front, and her long blonde hair was in a ponytail, she had on a pair of blue jeans that would have been tighter on her if she hadn't had two bags under her arm.</p> <p>Amanda had finally finished and walked to her front door that is her first day at work, as she knew she would have lots to put on, she checked herself in the mirror. Amanda was a beauty. Amanda wasn't even 5'4", and weighed around 120 pounds. She had always thought she was pretty, but in an everyday life it took her about five minutes for someone to recognize how much the image of her body was important. Amanda looked at her from the mirror and realized it was even more important than her height to have the real thing, a pair of 38DD's with all of a woman's curves. This was part of her fantasy for the past many years. She was trying to figure out if it would work as a relationship, or if it would lead to anything but a relationship. Amanda decided she did not want a relationship with a long-term relationship. The only thing on her mind was how quickly this can change her life, and if it is working for them both, that is what mattered. She pulled her hair back and threw a lock of it around her head, then she walked into her classroom, it was almost empty. She checked inside her classroom door and found it unlocked and locked. Amanda knocked on the door and was surprised to hear a female voice. Amanda walked slowly into the room, in walked her friend, Alex. Amanda stood there in the doorway, she didn't really want to beâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
