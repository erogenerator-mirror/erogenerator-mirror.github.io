We both need to enjoy each other, and I'm afraid I'm falling for you at the moment."</p> <p>"Gee, thanks a lot. Don't go getting so wound up, too."</p> <p>"No problem." He grinned to himself. "Let's eat dinner now. I'll call you later."</p> <p>She kissed him on the cheek and they left the restaurant.</p> <p>"So," she began, "You said we could... you know... do something, and I do too for you right now."</p> <p>"That's okay." He took a sip of wine and smiled seductively. "And you're right, I would do anything for you right now."</p> <p>She leaned over and kissed him on the lips. His eyes went wide as they entered hers. "You really do want me to do it, don't you?"</p> <p>"Uh huh."</p> <p>He smiled and leaned over to kiss her on the lips again. Again, it had the same effect. She opened to him and their tongues met in foreplay.</p> <p>"I'm not sure," he joked when he felt her lips touch his again.</p> <p>"Well, just because I do say you shouldn't go to dinner with that mouth of yours," she said, "that's okay." The kiss ended, and she moved so she could take off her coat and put it on the coat rack and the rack next to the couch. In the living-room they undressed each other. He laid her down on the couch and she immediately got into the doggy style position. They made to fuck each other on the same time.</p> <p>"I love your cock," she said, "it makes me so hot it won't take long to make me come."</p> <p>"It's still not that long." He took his time slowly fucking her, going in and out of her slowly and tenderly, not getting too deep, just enough to make her squeal and beg for more.</p> <p>"I've been thinking for a while about this," she said.</p> <p>"And?"</p> <p>"Well, I like your cock, you know."</p> <p>He chuckled. "I guess that means you like my cock as much, if not more, than my mouth." He stopped, then. "You know, I'm not sure if I should tell you this, but I am not the best of boyfriends, so this is your last chance to tell me anything without ruining the relationship."</p> <p>"Oh no. I wanted you to tell me the truth." Their hands were all over each other as they lay there, getting off at the same time and going through their first real sexual experience of the night.</p> <p>"So, you're okay with me being with other guys, right?"</p> <p>"I guess so."</p> <p>"Do it to me," she said, "Make me come."</p> <p>He got on her and she spread her legs for him. He entered her and fucked her hard as they kissed. Her body was shaking as she took his first ejaculation of the evening. He shot in her again and she let out a moan.</p> <p>"Ohh baby." He didn't need to say anything to encourage her to fuck him, and he lasted a little longer than he normally would. He'd also told her that their next break would be at ten to fifteen. The rest of the night was a blur of orgasmic bliss and sex.</p> <p>The next thing she knew was that she was sucking on him. No matter what they did in their lovemaking, it always felt so right to her.</p> <p>In her mind, she knew it had been the worst possible moment of her life, but it was also the sexiest moment of hers, so she didn't care. Her body got the attention her mind, and her heart, was giving out. She didn't care if that meant fucking guys she had just met or that some guys would want to make love to her, she wanted to do this. She wanted to be his first and his only. She got what she deserved, as long as that wasn't too late.</p> <p>She was still sucking when she felt him soften.</p> <p>"That was fun!" she said softly. "Now I want to do that again."</p> <p>"Definitely."</p> <p>They took a shower together, and that night they got together, as well, without any strings attached. He made it known that he would make love to her whether she wished it so, either for their final session, or in lieu of it, either way. She told him she was not sure if she wanted to try it in the dark. He was okay with that. He loved her very much, and he thought they would onlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
