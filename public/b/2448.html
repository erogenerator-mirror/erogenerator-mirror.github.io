There's nobody else in the house but my wife and myself. Our three children are playing in the den. And you know me, I'll probably do a lot of the housework and cooking, don't I? Well, at least we've got our laundry.</p> <p>My wife is curled up in a chair next to the window, and I'm sitting in a big stuffed chair behind her, watching the news. My oldest daughter has just been diagnosed with terminal cancer. And she's been in remission for the year. And that's been going on for the past nine months, and my wife's been so upset about it that I couldn't come up with anything she could do to explain it all. She hasn't even talked to me about it. Not even when she came home from work one day, when I was having a beer with one of her friends. I thought she was going to call the police or something. And then I've heard her gabbling that she doesn't know what happened to her, that she's pregnant, and she's getting a mastectomy just like my dad. I can't help thinking what's going to happen to me when she's not around. And I really don't know.</p> <p>We have been together for nine months, and it's been kind of surreal. We haven't really spent a lot of time away from our work. But we do spend a lot of time together. Every night we spend with each other and we go to bed together. We go to the gym together and go to bed together. It's one of my favorite ways of getting to know her better. And now that it's been nine months, I'm sure things are going to change between us. And I know I'm probably going to do a lot of things with that change.</p> <p>I had a little time on Monday morning, so I got up and headed to the kitchen. "Well, look at the time," I said, "we better get breakfast going before mommy gets up." You see, I'm getting the day off myself, and I'm going to take a shower, and take my bath. I'm already in the bathroom and have just started the water running. When I get through the door I'm going to let it run out and get the steaming hot water.</p> <p>When I stepped to the shower head, there was my wife and mother on their knees, facing each other. They were both naked, and my mother was on her knees in front of her daughter. I didn't say anything. I mean, they were both naked, my wife and mother, and they seemed so familiar with each other.</p> <p>And then I heard the familiar sound of the shower curtain being pulled back. A few moments later my wife and I were both standing in the shower, a naked stranger about to take her daughter. And I was right with it! I'm not sure exactly what it was exactly, but I think the fact that we were just there looking at each other really had something to do with it.</p> <p>While all this was going on, I was trying to watch my mother's handiwork. I started by just going into the bathroom and taking a peek at the two of them. My wife, she was standing right behind my mother as my mother washed herself. It was so dark, I could hardly see my mother in the water. But I had a pretty good idea that my mother was just washing my father's penis.</p> <p>I could still plainly see them rubbing each other's crotches, and their own little moans of pleasure as they washed each other off. And I'm sure that by now the situation was getting pretty sexual.</p> <p>I thought it pretty obvious, and I just had to figure out what the heck was going on with my wife. I mean, she sure was a sexy woman, but right then I think we've got things going. And if we were even two minutes away from having sex, then this was probably going to happen. But instead of looking down at me, she stepped in front of me, leaning against the wall next to the shower.</p> <p>She whispered, "I'm so sorry I had to come home drunk to let you get away from your father just like this. Can you forgive me, John? I know you really need to get ready for work this week. Please, I really need to get out of here. I just got worried that you might be able to help me from working. Please, John." She smiled at me, and then stepped so close that her breasts almost brushed the hair on my chest. Oh, this might be the best chance I ever had had to ask her to leave.</p> <p>I pulled her into my arms and hugged her, and she responded. "Of course I can help you, John. I really need to get ready for work. I have a few days of classesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
