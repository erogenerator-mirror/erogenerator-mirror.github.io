What's wrong!" Ahaa sobbed as she saw herself in the mirror, seeing herself getting angry. Ahaa was a middle-aged housewife, 5 foot 7, with long slender curves. She hadn't had a boyfriend in a while and her husband, the owner of the house, was gone, so she couldn't live in a fancy place like this, as if she's just wanted some peace and quiet.</p> <p>The reflection of her backside looked just as hard as her face was, with bright white freckles and heavy brown eyes that looked to be the color of a baby's eye. The long blond hair stood up in a wave at the top of her black hair. Her face was the kind that looked like she had seen a ghost. She could also tell that she was thin, with just a touch of sag. Her face was beautiful, and even though it was not her best feature, it was something which every man coveted. Her nose was small enough to look feminine but large enough that she seemed to be constantly on the verge of showing her face. Though she was always proud of her large breasts, that were a large D, being the largest breasts she'd ever seen in real life.</p> <p>"What the fu- ... what is this?" Ahaa shouted through clenched teeth as she tried to hold back a scream.</p> <p>"Nothing!" the boy's voice echoed out of the window, "This is my house!"</p> <p>"My house, is yours!" Ahaa heard his booming voice come through the small window, "It's my home now!"</p> <p>"I am not yours!" she heard him say.</p> <p>"I am, my house is mine." She heard him say back, "It is mine, my house is yours." He sounded angry and she thought she was being unreasonable. The tears welled up in her eyes, but still seemed to have no effect on her composure.</p> <p>Ahaa realized that she was staring at a young boy walking towards her. She tried to ignore the looks her friend's parents got whenever they called out the window, and even looked over at her husband when they passed.</p> <p>"What's your name?" She heard her husband say back.</p> <p>"I...I'm, I'm not, I'm sorry!" Ahaa stammered, "I'm not your's!" Ahaa's voice sounded as if she had been in an emotional mess, as she looked up at the man. Despite the tears, she still managed to smile. It was a big smile like she had gotten over the tears of her husband's friend, the boy who lived within yards of her.</p> <p>"I'm sorry that I thought you'd want to give me a second chance today young lady. But don't worry I'm sure you'll get some much better chance. Just remember I paid for you to come over here and I still take care of you." The man said, his accent a mix of thick and accented accent. Ahaa shivered as her eyes caught the dark gray eyes of her husband. Although she didn't even know the man himself, she knew the boy's voice.</p> <p>"Oh, good I'm here!" Ahaa said, shaking her head as a little shake of her head was the only thing she could think of. The boy's bright blue eyes looked at the other young man and she saw that he had a bit of a belly with the black, white, and brown of his complexion. He was about six feet tall with dark hair that had brown streaks running to mid back, and his eyes seemed to be hazel. Unlike her friend, Ahaa liked the man. The young man seemed to fit the description of the boy, and they were good old-fashioned gentlemen. They all sat in the back of the house, talking with each other, and Ahaa heard her friend's parents talking about the town.</p> <p>Her husband saw the young boy and waved her for her to come home. She looked at him in disappointment, but shook it off. She was not going back to this place where she felt cheap. She was going to get a break. She turned and headed back up and started up the stairs to the room where her two friends' house was. Ahaa knocked once on the solid wood door and it slowly opened. The girl's friend stepped back in and closed the door. Ahaa knew it was her friend but couldn't see her face from the dark shadows of the room. As she got closer, Ahaa saw a face she recognized as her best friend's. She smiled in a way she'd never seen before when she'd been staring at the other girl's friend's face to the exclusion of everyone. Ahaa smiled back that same smile.</p> <p>The young girl looked into Ahaa's eyes and sawâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
