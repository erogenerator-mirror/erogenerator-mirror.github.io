She leaned in and leaned over the back of the couch, the kiss lingering. As we kissed, I ran my hands all over her body, kneading her ass and sliding her up and down on my cock. I leaned forward and kissed her neck. My right hand slid down and between her legs. I couldn't believe how wet and hot her pussy was. It was already leaking her juices that were beginning to run down between her firm breasts. I slipped two finger into her. She arched her hips to try to get me deeper but I pushed her back away from the couch. Her hands gripped her skirt at my sides.</p> <p>I began to take off what seemed like hours of my work in just my socks. I slowly removed the other shoe, and finally I tossed it aside.</p> <p>"Hmmm....the sock was too hot...I'll come." I murmured.</p> <p>I moved in front of her and she placed her feet against my chest. I leaned down and took a nipple into my mouth. Sucking it and nipping it softly with my teeth. I ran my tongue up and down her nipple and across her breast, getting it wet with my saliva. I could feel her arching her back, wanting me to continue, but I ignored her, taking my lips from her chest and placing them to her neck. I kissed her there, feeling the sweat on her skin as it rubbed against my lips.</p> <p>Sitting up, I reached behind her head and pulled her into my lap. She quickly moved and positioned herself over my cock. As she settled onto me, I slipped one of my hands around and began to rub her clit. She started riding me, her hips moving back and forth as she tried to get as much of me into her. The friction was intense and she kept up her little dance until I groaned, pushing into her. That sensation pushed her over the edge of her control. As she came, her pussy clenched around me, her insides quivering as if she had never done anything before. Her hands wrapped around mine and her orgasm was as big as my own, and I could feel her pussy contract around me. Her arms pulled on mine tightly and she leaned back a little more, grinding my cock against her ass. We stopped moving and stayed like that, catching our breath and enjoying each other as we kissed softly.</p> <p>"Are you ready for more?" She asked. Her voice was smooth and sexy.</p> <p>"Yes...yes, I want more. It's been far too long for me....this way I can really feel you....mmmm...now," I whispered.</p> <p>"You aren't taking your pants off for me." She smiled.</p> <p>I unbuttoned my jeans and slid them down my legs, then unzipped my pants. I took my socks off, and pulled my cock out. She looked at it a few times and ran her hand along it. I could feel the precum on it and we both moaned. She took her time stroking me, sliding up and down, taking almost all of me in one motion. She leaned down so our lips could meet. I started to fuck her and she pressed her body against me, trying to get it deeper. I kept thrusting in and out, fucking her so she could take her time. I slid my hand up her skirt and I felt her pussy. I spread her legs. She bent down, kissed me and pulled back, leaving me thrusting inside. She sat there for a few moments, looking over at me with a wicked smile, then began to lick me.</p> <p>I could not hold back any longer and I pulled her face back into my lap, pushing her off of me and I began to cum inside of her. She moaned against my cock when I came. I pumped it in her again just as I was ready to unload. She grabbed my cock and began to rub it against her clit as I emptied myself into her. I could feel the contractions of my cock as the tip came out, but the orgasm that preceded it overwhelmed me. The pressure had begun to subside, leaving me as limp as a dead man. She moved up and down on my cock till I shot my last load in her. I could not believe this was happening, but the momentary loss of control had driven me to the edge again.</p> <p>She rolled off the couch on her back and I was on top of her again. She wrapped her arms around me as I pushed inside of her, pushing us both to the brink of orgasm. She was breathing hard and moaning in between her ragged moans. We finally fell asleep in each other's arms with my dick still in her, the last drops of my cum still dripping out of her as weâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
