"Want to take me to a camp fire?" she asked playfully.</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"Oh, my goodness, honey. I can tell you want more than just a campfire," she laughed.</p> <p>Dori rolled over and stretched. "I hope so," she said to Dorothy, "because I sure do." She kissed Dorothy, then said, "Dorothy, I am so sorry. I thought I knew."</p> <p>"I know," Dorothy smiled, "and don't try to hide it. And look!" She gave Dorothy a sly finger. "You are too gorgeous for your own good, just look."</p> <p>"Dorothy, why don't you show me your panties?"</p> <p>"Do you want me to take my panties off?"</p> <p>"I don't know if I should..."</p> <p>"Would you?" she giggled. "I've got a feeling your wife is about to do something special for you. What do you say?"</p> <p>"I agree," Dorothy moaned.</p> <p>Dorothy smiled and stepped into the grass, lifting one leg over the other. "Take a good long look."</p> <p>Dorothy looked at her pussy, and saw the dampness there, too. She reached down and touched her finger to her lips. "Does it taste as good as it smells, Dorothy?"</p> <p>Dorothy just looked at her smiling. "Do I taste as good as you're looking at?" she said, "I like when you talk about other women."</p> <p>"All right, you've said it. It doesn't take it long to get your pussy good and turned on, like I did when I ate you down at The Hole." There was a knock at the door. "Come in!"</p> <p>The girls came in with a cart that had several picnic baskets. The men and women sat in the easy chairs as they set out their food and picnic basket, with more food in there also. The girls finished their breakfast, then were told to wait in the basket. In less than minutes, the door opened again, a short young man walked in. "I'm glad you're ready to see us and let us in," he said. He handed Dorothy a pair of his clothes.</p> <p>"These will be coming off in a minute," he added.</p> <p>"Oh God," Dorothy groaned. Then she looked at the baskets with a look of horror. "My...my dress!"</p> <p>"Here!" Dorothy said with a smile. She took off the last of her clothes.</p> <p>"Oh my goodness," Dorothy gasped, "oh my goodness, my...my panties!" She couldn't believe she was saying this in front of a man. There was nothing she could say to stop, even if she wanted to. "Now, they won't be coming off in just a minute," she continued, "at least for some time." She stood there, naked, in the middle of the basket that contained a few food containers. The young man smiled and pointed. "Put these on," he said. "That will make you feel very good."</p> <p>Dorothy felt herself go weak. She'd heard of men putting their own clothes on. She remembered what Tommy had told her. "I hope they like being naked," she thought. "It makes me feel sexy."</p> <p>"Here you can help," said the man. He handed Dorothy a pair of scissors, "a pair of shoes, also. I had them specially made for you." It took Dorothy a moment to realize what he was talking about. "Oh, dear, they look so, so...," she stammered. He was looking at the basket while she was explaining it. He smiled and said, "Now, sit down, so we can get started." She sat down in the basket with an awkward smile.</p> <p>Tommy was standing there naked in a circle watching some strange man in front of him. He thought there was a connection there between Dorothy and Tommy. He was embarrassed, but couldn't think of anything else to say. He had never gone into a man's house naked, never mind taken things to this degree. But, he had to look at Dorothy. She looked over at him and smiled a smile that lit his bedroom. Tom knew that Dorothy was a very attractive woman. He'd been a virgin all of his life, just one boy and girl. But there was something about her. She'd looked so innocent and so beautiful in her uniform of a uniformed officer. He couldn't get over the fact that she could look this way all night. Then she was walking around the house, carrying her clothesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
