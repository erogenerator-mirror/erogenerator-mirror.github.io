I was angry with her for what her doing to me and why I was doing it, but the fact that she had gone over my body in such a way as to make me react so completely changed all that. And that she had put the same effect on me! I knew it, but now I was confused as to why.</p> <p>"Do I look like a real man?" I asked, barely above a whisper.</p> <p>"You're a guy," she said softly, as she took my chin in her hand and said, "And you're beautiful."</p> <p>I was shocked, and as this was the first time that she had ever used the word 'pretty' in a manner that made me uncomfortable, I felt my heart beat stop.</p> <p>"Look at me," I told her, "Don't you like being a woman?"</p> <p>"I like it just as much," she explained. She took off her shirt completely and her blue lace bra pushed her breasts up so that they were almost fully in my face, her nipples almost in my mouth, "and I like the way this makes me feel." She was now completely naked and I was in the midst of another bout of arousal.</p> <p>She was laying on her side, looking back at me.</p> <p>"Do you love me?" she asked, her breath coming out in little gasps as she spoke.</p> <p>I could scarcely speak. Her question was so intimate. But I was beyond the point of speaking. I had to take a chance and say what I had to.</p> <p>"Yes," I said, "I love you."</p> <p>"Say it again," she said, looking back at me.</p> <p>"Do you love me?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes," she replied, "I do. You are beautiful"</p> <p>I was overwhelmed by emotion. The fact that I loved this woman for what she did to me had somehow pushed me to the point of being desperate for more. I could feel my cock hard beneath me and I had to put my hands back on her hips to prevent from moving them.</p> <p>My hands were on her hips. I was moving them up and down. I lifted her to her tummy and began to kiss down her body, taking care to keep her from moving. My mouth traveled slowly down her body, stopping to cover one breast and her nipple at the same time.</p> <p>I could never tell when I was kissing her or not. Her chest rose and fell rapidly as a result of my gentle exploration. She raised her hips to meet my lips. I continued to kiss her body all the way down her ribs and her ribs and then took her other nipple into my mouth, biting lightly on her as my lips moved further down her body. When my lips left her breasts my hands moved up her body and grasped her breasts, holding them tightly in my large hands.</p> <p>"Oh My God," she gasped. I heard a quiet moan escape from her lips. I ran my hands all over those beautiful mounds and began to gently pinch her nipples. I could tell she liked the feeling. I lowered my mouth to her breast and began to give her nipple the same treatment that I had just given to her left breast.</p> <p>She raised her hands behind the back of the sofa and wrapped her arms around my head as I slowly moved them all up over her body, from her breasts up to her neck, over the swell of her breast with my fingers until all the way around her areolas and then down again, each time bringing her closer to the edge when both nipples had become so sensitive that they almost ached.</p> <p>Her hands began to roam over me while my lips stayed where they were. I kept to the spot where I could feel myself growing bigger. I thought about how good she felt and what I must look like before. She was standing on two feet, but I could see her eyes were slightly red. She was breathing hard as I moved up to kiss her deeply, deeply and passionately.</p> <p>My cock, hard as iron, brushed her leg, and my lips had made it to her nipples, and I knew she could feel it as well as hear me moan. Her nipples were hard and standing at least as high up as she could get them. Her hands had left my head and her breast were falling into my face as it rubbed over my teeth.</p> <p>"Oh God," I cried, "I've never been so aroused."</p> <p>My hands were once again on her hips as I began to lift her onto my cock. I tried to hold her on my shaft, but that was all that I could do as I felt her wetness around me. As I came to the point that I could feel myself pulsating and her body shaking, I could still hold on, and I moved my cock up the length of her leg. I could feel her warmth against me and I lowered her backâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
