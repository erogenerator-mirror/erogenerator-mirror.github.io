"I really thought, 'I could really do this,' and it was the way things started. It's been almost twenty one years since this has happened to me, and I just keep expecting there'll be another one. When I thought I'd never see her anymore, my wife came home early and took me with her, so I figured it would be worth getting my hopes up once and for all, and I can't count the good things that can happen with a nice young girl. That, and my life getting stronger all the time!"</p> <p>"Yes, I like the little girl, she makes me feel young again," said a voice that sounded as close to old as my heart can be. I looked up and saw Sarah.</p> <p>"Good morning," I said as a friend and old lover approached us.</p> <p>"Hi, I'm Kayden and this is Tom. We had to come to visit you, and I had to have a chance to get him out of you before you got here," Tom said as we shook hands. "We really are glad that we came over and helped you out. We could do without the kids for now. I'm sorry we didn't get a chance to thank you for the hospitality.</p> <p>Kayden smiled warmly at Sarah. "I'm very proud to have such a wonderful old friend. Please call me Sarah. I haven't seen her in years, and I'm not sure what to call her." Tom nodded in approval. Sarah had gone to him for years, and always asked for his opinion on things that a lot of people don't really seem to know they even care to know. I felt a strong sense of confidence in her.</p> <p>Kayden took my hand as I took the other one and introduced me to Sarah. "Welcome to my home, Sarah." Sarah had a beautiful smile and eyes that seemed to sparkle. It was the kind of smile that you just knew that you loved her.</p> <p>As we shook hands, Tom asked Sarah, "Why didn't you call us at first? I've had plenty of good news and bad news of my future, but I didn't think it made any sense to wait for this meeting."</p> <p>"It probably doesn't make a good ending anyway," I said laughing heartily, "but it was all just so much better than I could have possibly made a decision. If it was in my best interest to wait until the next day, I probably would have tried to change things, but that's a lot to ask of the woman of my dreams."</p> <p>"Well, at least you get to kiss one of them first," Tom said. Tom gave me his once over a bit.</p> <p>"I'm not sure that's a good idea right now. I'm having a hard time holding my head in if I'm going to kiss another man right now. Can we change the subject?"</p> <p>"Sure," said Tom as he walked back over to his desk and stood there in front of me for a minute. I wasn't sure that was a good idea, but I still couldn't help but think that there was definitely a nice difference between what the two men had already seen.</p> <p>"Tom!" I said suddenly before he could even finish his sentence.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm sure you'll find out why in an hour or so," he said as he turned and walked off.</p> <p>I stood there in stunned silence for a second, while Sarah slowly walked over and shook Tom's hands.</p> <p>"That was wonderful, Sarah," I said kissing her hand.</p> <p>"Oh my God, Kayden, you are one lucky man. Thank you so much for helping me with Sarah today," said Sarah. We went over and introduced ourselves. There was a friendly little kiss, both of them looking down into my eyes.</p> <p>"You are so damn cute, Sarah," I said as I sat down next to her.</p> <p>"Well, thank you, Kayden. That was so sweet of you to take such good care of us." We started to kiss gently again, and after a few minutes, I felt Kayden's fingers slide down my neck and start into my hair. It was my turn to smile. As I looked over to Sarah, she was still sitting next to us, not saying anything.</p> <p>"She's all yours," I told Kayden.</p> <p>"You too," said Kayden, as he squeezed my hand.</p> <p>I leaned over and kissed Sarah, then Tom before moving into my side. I felt Sarah's hand slide down my thigh and start on her neck, as her hand felt the outside of my thigh.
