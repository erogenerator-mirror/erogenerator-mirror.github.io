I said pulling my lips off her. She blushed her face then pulled me into a passionate kiss. I rolled her onto her side and spooned into her. I put my hands on the small of her back. We were soon asleep.</p> <p>The next morning I woke up to a soft warm body pressed into my back. She was spooning me. I felt the gentle press of her breasts against my back. Soon we were asleep.</p> <p>I woke up the next morning wondering what I had gotten myself into this morning.</p> <p>We had a wonderful breakfast and had some coffee. I asked Kim to get her car ready. I helped get the truck to the highway for a ride. All she wanted was to get out of bed, get a shower, and brush her teeth before it was time to start getting ready for work. She gave me a wink, and we said our safe words.</p> <p>The car was ready when Kim pulled into the garage.</p> <p>"Thanks." She said.</p> <p>I asked her if she had a new suit she wanted to wear for work.</p> <p>"Sure. Do a good job."</p> <p>"Thanks." She said putting her car in the garage. Her suit was beautiful. A light material. She wore a nice white cotton shirt and very tight fitting jeans. The bottom button was undone down the front, and had a very clear cleavage which I had to keep from staring.</p> <p>Kim stepped to the door and saw the suit. She slipped it on.</p> <p>"That looks good on you." She said.</p> <p>We went to work happy. When we got home and got the car, we headed for the door. It was only about 10:15, but we still had about an hour to start.</p> <p>During the ride, Kim looked over at me and smiled.</p> <p>"My friend is going to be here from 10:30 to 15 and she should get ready to go." She explained.</p> <p>"Okay, I'll catch up." I got out and got dressed. I had on my navy checked shirt and khakis with a nice pair of black shoes.</p> <p>The doorbell chimed at exactly the same time that Kim opened the door. She jumped when she saw me, not even flinching. "You're early." She winked at me.</p> <p>The doorbell chimed again. This time, it went higher.</p> <p>Kim took a quick look around the house. She found the house was clean, and it was nice. It was a little dark in the kitchen, and there was some light coming from the hall. She went over to the doorway and was very surprised to find him standing there.</p> <p>"I was just about to see if you were here." He said as he put a soft kiss to her lips.</p> <p>They kissed deeply for a few seconds. He pulled back and looked at her. "I'm sorry you had to know. I just have been thinking about you all day." He said looking at how nice she looked in that jacket. "I can't thank you enough for what you did with the car last night."</p> <p>"I'm sorry I shouldn't have done that. It was unexpected." She apologized.</p> <p>"I wouldn't let it be. I really appreciate you going out with me, but in light of what you did yesterday." He smiled.</p> <p>"I know you do. I really didn't expect that from you." She shrugged, and put her hand down to his crotch.</p> <p>"Really?" He said looking at her as she got a hand on my crotch. It was already getting hard. His look of confusion didn't go off well to her.</p> <p>"Really?" She said putting both hands on his shaft.</p> <p>"Really." He said in a soft and almost fatherly voice.</p> <p>"Oh my god." She moaned as she continued to rub him through the pants. She took her hands away.</p> <p>"I just can't wait to see my little boy in all his glory." She smiled at him.</p> <p>She bent down and kissed and nipped on his balls. It was an odd tasting, but not too bad. They were nice. He looked down at her tits and pulled up her shirt. She kept one hand in there while he started to lick her tits. She stopped him and stepped away from him.</p> <p>"Not yet" She said to him.</p> <p>He sat on a corner of the couch naked with her. Her top was so thin that I could just make out his nipple. Her tits were larger, and her nipples got hard at just the thought of him doing that to her. She sat down beside him.</p> <p>"You know how much I love that bra you wear to work." She said as she took his arm and guided him to face herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
