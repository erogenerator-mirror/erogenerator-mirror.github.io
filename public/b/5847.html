Then I went and grabbed the camera and started taking the pictures. The pictures didn't last long and I was getting so into the shots when I saw him leave out my room. I walked in and saw him get dressed and then he was coming out. When he walked to the door I had to stop and stare. I had seen him looking at me so often since he got out of the shower that I was a little nervous. After I watched as him disappear around the corner into the hallway I decided that I wanted to watch him fuck me again. I walked over to his dresser and sat on the edge of the bed. I grabbed my phone and video tape and laid face down with my arms behind my head leaning against the headboard. As I snapped away my hand found my swollen clitoris and started rubbing it lightly. With the camera focused on me I kept rubbing with more and more intensity until I was really getting close to an orgasm. As I came back to my senses I saw him come out and start toward the door with a huge grin on his face.</p> <p>"Are you enjoying yourself?" he asked with a wink.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, I am."</p> <p>He shook his head and walked away. I was on the high road once again and wanted to feel his dick deep inside me again so bad at that point. So I lay on the bed completely naked while holding my phone.</p> <p>"So, what were you thinking about?" I asked, trying to keep my voice as calm as it needed to be.</p> <p>"Nothing."</p> <p>"Oh no, nothing. I knew it. You were totally out of control." I laughed nervously.</p> <p>"You can't tell me that." I laughed.</p> <p>"Can I? I mean, I'm kidding, right?"</p> <p>"Not at all. I just thought you were so much less wild." I leaned against him then closed my eyes and focused on the feel. My pussy lips glistened from where we had both cumming together. I could feel a drip of our combined fluids on the sheets from the contact.</p> <p>"No, you can't tell me." I said again.</p> <p>"Okay. So, what about your video?"</p> <p>"What video? About your... About your doing that and me?"</p> <p>"You got to be kidding right?"</p> <p>"No. You wanted me to do that so bad. And that video. And how it's gonna turn out. And of course it's going to turn out good." I looked him in the eyes and put my arms around him. "Come on, we gotta get going. We really don't have a schedule to meet. And we got an early meeting today." I felt so stupid for doing something stupid. "I hope you enjoyed it." I smiled sweetly. "I'm sure we'll do it again..." I said in a teasing voice.</p> <p>"I do." He laughed. I felt like he was serious. I wanted him to fuck me again.</p> <p>"But, how? What do you think it'll take for us to get together?"</p> <p>"You're going to have an interview with me tomorrow morning." I could see the concern in his eyes. I smiled coyly. It was time to get serious again and I was getting closer to the edge.</p> <p>"How will you know that?" He asked. "You're going to tell it to whoever you like so you can trust your judgment."</p> <p>"What? How?"</p> <p>"Just let it go. It's too late. You'll feel better for it." I could feel his heart pound against my chest and it was making me weak in the knees.</p> <p>"I don't know what to tell you."</p> <p>"No, it's okay. I can't help it. I'm scared. I've thought about it."</p> <p>"Are you ready?"</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"Okay. I've set this up. I've arranged it so far. I've even gotten your address and the address on your phone and I have your email password. You didn't even need that to recognize my name and I would have seen it on my cell."</p> <p>"Okay, I feel good about it."</p> <p>"Not even close. Come on. We haven't even touched. You're gonna love it." I stood up, walked over to him and took his hand. We walked down the hall to my office and sat at the computer to write our stories and email the results. I turned on my PC while we were working.</p> <p>"I'm so nervous, I want this to happen again. I've never done this before."</p> <p>"You should be. It's going fine.
