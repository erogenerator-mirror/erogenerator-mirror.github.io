Are you okay with me being the one to bring her out and make you feel better? I mean, I'm not too busy on your weekend."</p> <p>"If I were your wife, I would never let you leave town."</p> <p>"Okay, how about Monday. Then we can do this again and I'll be busy with school in town."</p> <p>"And don't have Mom or JB help you with studying, okay?"</p> <p>"Sure, I guess."</p> <p>"Just call me tomorrow morning and when I get back, you can call me."</p> <p>I hung up the phone and I didn't say a word. We were so tired, and I knew it would be good for us to get away for a while. But we had to be able to tell her. It was important for me to get the divorce off my chest, without her knowing about it, and we were just the same about that.</p> <p>The next morning I drove across town and found the divorce court. All there were men there, and I didn't see anything for myself. I had not even spoken to the Judge for two weeks and I was nervous. I called my mother and told her what happened to me. She didn't say a word, just took off for work.</p> <p>I started the second day of work and saw no one so I got another job. The second day went by and then the third and fourth, and then there was no going back. After about 3 weeks I saw my step-sister in the corner of my eye that night. She was talking to a male client so I did my best to keep my eyes off her.</p> <p>It was a Thursday and just after work I went home and went straight home. I was tired, but I was able to sleep. I got up early and made coffee and sat down in the living room to watch a DVD. There was a note on my coffee table in full view of the TV. It wasn't a copy of an article from the newspaper, but it was very clear. It said, "I just got back from a business trip to San Diego. I'm really sorry that I'm gone. I hope that when you get back you'll be able to talk with me about what happened. Just have a drink and watch this one." It was not what I thought I was going to read. It was about the time that I was ready to turn it in.</p> <p>"Oh, here it is," I tossed the note and the coffee to the DVD player.</p> <p>The story had a lot of graphic scenes that most would consider rape. It was basically a rape story and I read the description of the person that got raped. It was the guy who got the rape. The woman got the rape and the guy made him give the girl a ride home without giving in and then raped the rest of the way home. The man also got what he wanted. It was about a wife and a baby from a relative so it left out part of the rape. The wife was not going home to get her husband raped because she is a happily married woman and she doesn't have a lot of money and does love the guy who did it to her. The guy was also making her make up and do it. It made him want to commit the same thing to her that he did to me, and I didn't blame him though. I read the description of the guy's wife and told him of his own rape. It was so graphic and graphic that it got me so hot that I had to stop and jerk off immediately. "Oh, this is so hot," I said out of some self-consciousness about having sex in public.</p> <p>After my reading the description of the guy's wife and the rape description, I decided not to tell her about what turned me on and started to talk. "What does anyone think if I tell you that I made them make me suck that guy's cock?"</p> <p>"What, no-o! You're kidding!"</p> <p>"Don't tell people it's true that I did it. I was married for 15 years and I don't need to hear this from a couple that know me."</p> <p>"You didn't give in to anybody, did you?"</p> <p>"Nope. And I didn't do anything with your ex-wife, she was drunk and I think it made up for her not being able to get it up that night. What did we get up to in that bar?"</p> <p>"That depends. What did you do?"</p> <p>"Nothing." I looked at the note on my coffee table and took another sip of coffee.</p> <p>"No, you had nothing going. We were only trying to start from the beginning. It was good sex, right?"</p> <p>"Yeah, not really greatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
