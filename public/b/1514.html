A week later they had managed to keep each other's clothes and were back at the dance. It was a lovely evening, but the music stopped and the night got dark. He pulled her in close and put his hand on her breast, not to fondle her with the nipple but still letting her feel his hardness through his trousers as he pressed against her bum to hold her close.</p> <p>As midnight approached they said their goodnight's and he left them to it. He left them as they went off to bed.</p> <p>The following day as usual he left the house early. He had not said a word as they walked down to breakfast; only nodded and said that he had seen her and she had come to kiss him properly.</p> <p>He had not seen her again as usual but had seen her again the following day.</p> <p>It was an evening like all of the rest, the sun was rising and a chill wind was blowing as they ate their last meal, the sun had now risen high in the sky and it was dark yet he felt as if his thoughts would drift away from the present moment and he smiled at her and said,</p> <p>"I have never done this before"</p> <p>"I wondered how you would react to it!" she replied.</p> <p>The light-heartedness they were having, which had been a long time in fact had ended with them going to bed early, but as he left them to get up to walk she kissed him.</p> <p>He had felt it again and said. "Do you have a condom please"?</p> <p>"No, not for now; in the future I will make sure that you are protected." she said as she had put on her pyjamas before they left their house.</p> <p>"How can I not be protected from your parents when they walk in and see you?" he had said.</p> <p>"I can use the bathroom and take them out of the car then get myself cleaned up. I know you can't go out like my brother in our house. The only thing I am willing to do is put it on."</p> <p>After their evening with the moon out she had left for the flat and the house. She had felt very nervous, he had never kissed a girl when alone with him. He was also not as adventurous as she used to and he had seen her in a similar state a few times.</p> <p>She had put on the dressing gown over her nightie and slipped into the thin nightdress she had chosen. She looked at herself in the mirror and said it should be very nice to wear for him.</p> <p>Her night dress was long and it clung to her like a second skin. It was very short and she had put on the highest high heels she had. It was very tight so the straps on the top of her right arm were clearly visible. She went to the toilet and then put on her new dress; as she pulled it tight over her shoulders it hung on her shoulders. She put on a tiny little brassiere and her eyes were hidden by her shoulder straps as she walked from the bathroom. The white top showed her cleavage completely and could be seen across her blouse. She had put on her short skirt and just had on panties on underneath.</p> <p>As she walked from him, he had said he would be returning the next night.</p> <p>"I'm sorry!"</p> <p>She had said, "Don't be; just fuck me!"</p> <p>"Ok," he replied as he felt her breasts as she walked. She laughed and went to bed. She was very tired this evening and as she fell asleep asleep he took in the sight of her figure. It was very sexy and as it turned to daylight, the silk gown was sliding over her bare back as she lay there naked. The white lacy fabric barely covered her bottom but he knew she wore stockings with no knickers with their lace tops. He had seen her wear thongs a few times and knew that she did not wear any underwear, as he always did, but she didn't wear any on the day after school and he knew she wouldn't go without them. He had never seen her like this before and although it was a great way to end a day of dancing she didn't go to bed before he had.</p> <p>"You like that don't you?" she had said as she got up and went looking for her purse, then after getting dressed she went to the bathroom and used the toilet.</p> <p>In the toilet she had turned on the tap which had an internal jet that made hot water come up and over the toilet itself. She looked into the mirror and with a sigh she decided she should try it.</p> <p>With an effort she undid her gown and let it drop, it was the only piece of fabric that was left to cover her body.</p> <p>She looked in the mirror as she was turning to go through the toilet but foundâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
