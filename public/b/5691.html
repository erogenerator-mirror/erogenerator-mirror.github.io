She closed her eyes and concentrated on the act, and it felt good. I was a well-built man, her cock and balls were as big as footballs and had only a little sag to them. She worked her soft flesh up and down. I couldn't see how I should tell her to stop. I knew how she had to enjoy it.</p> <p>She was stroking me so fast now that I knew she must be very excited. I began to wonder if this was the first time we had done this and if she felt as good as I wanted to. She was really giving me the fuck of a lifetime!</p> <p>My wife went to town. She took my cock, the head, in her mouth and bobbed. Her tongue was working all the way around the shaft. She was sucking like a thirsty animal. I knew she would be coming soon. She bobbed as fast as she could. Her hands were at my sack rubbing up and down my whole frame.</p> <p>"Oh, baby, let it come," I whispered.</p> <p>I had no intention to hold out for much longer. It wasn't long, as it seemed, before I shot a huge load. She quickly released my cock, and it flopped onto my abdomen. I could feel it go up the shaft, it felt like a hose. She had never had a man come as much, or with as much as she just had. She got off of me after that.</p> <p>She looked me like a contented puppy. "Wow, I guess I should have said."</p> <p>I knew she had probably felt disappointed. "What's wrong dear?" I asked.</p> <p>"It feels like you shot a gallon in me. I guess that is what you did in Iraq."</p> <p>I was embarrassed to admit that it was probably not what I expected. There were still tears in the corners of her eyes. "Why don't you go lay down and rest a while."</p> <p>She took off her t-shirt and shorts and lay down on my bed. She said she had to go. No way I wanted to hear that. She must have felt guilty, as if the guilt about the incident made her feel guilty. If she had been a little more experienced she would have been less upset. It wasn't something a married woman could do with her own husbands sperm all inside herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
