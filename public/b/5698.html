I would be her, and I would want her. And yes, what could I have found for her if she rejected me?</p> <p>She came to me and whispered that she was coming in to feed me, and when she saw that I was about to begin to eat, she stopped and turned to face me and kissed me. I could taste my own desire in her mouth, and knew I would have to do everything to hold back as she fed me, and then it began as if she were my own. Her hand went back to play in my hair, and it would not take long for my hair to come to her hands and my mouth to open wide in welcome. She knew it, too. She stopped, and came to lie down beside me, resting her head on my shoulder. My hands found their way under her hair again, and I could tell what she had in mind by its texture. She looked up at me, and in that moment I knew my soul was hers, and I knew even before the last part of me could speak that I was hers.</p> <p>I knew from the start of my life, that she felt that. I knew that there was no telling if she felt it in her face. She felt the power inside me, and she knew that as much as she thought from my face in the car and on the sidewalk, she also knew that there was power inside me too. And, she found it in the power she was now feeling in my body.</p> <p>She moved over to her side, and as she moved I felt her lean down over mine. Then I felt the light touch of her lips on mine, and as I came up out of my shock, I had to smile. I knew that she knew my fear, and I felt the power of my own fear on hers. I put my hands to her face and she raised herself up and looked at me. I knew what she would do, because this was what I had wanted her to do, and now, with her kiss so deeply inside me, even though it was me that was just there for her.</p> <p>“It’s about to be good, isn’t it?” I heard her say, and she just nodded her head in agreement.</p> <p>It took only moments of her kiss before her lips touched mine again and her tongue was there again as well, and she moved from my mouth, then down my body into my pubic hair. I could feel her fingers playing within me, moving over my slit again and as she found my clitty in the way she knew I liked, her mouth closed over it and my moan was quiet until my body had no more energy to express.</p> <p>She kissed my clit and played with me, with her tongue and fingers, moving up the length of my clit until it could almost be seen by her lips and tongue, before sliding her mouth back down along my labia again. In a long slow motion, she began to move her tongue around my slit and with her tongue found my clit again as her fingers began to work on my hole.</p> <p>In the back of my mind I knew why she was doing this to me, but I could not quite put my finger on the point where she was now moving her mouth around my clit and I knew that in just the matter of a second she would have my clit too, and I knew not what to expect. Not just her mouth, but her entire body also, as her fingers moved deeper within me. She was making me cum and I wanted her to give me more and harder and deeper of her fingers in my pussy and inside me.</p> <p>Her mouth came off me completely and I felt all of me leave myself, even through her mouth as she kissed my thighs and pubic hair and worked her mouth back and forth over my slit. I felt her tongue sliding over my lips. I felt her tongue touch the skin of my thigh. And then I heard her mouth again move from my leg and I felt her slide the whole way up my leg. I felt my whole body shiver and my body relax as she was coming up over me once more.</p> <p>My mouth found hers again and we kissed with the same intensity and intensity, as the world seemed to become one and I could feel her kiss and love and desire and desire and love and my pleasure. We were so different from her earlier and we were both different. But it was our pleasure, and her power. I wanted to know the difference, and this seemed more like real life than I had ever imagined. So I smiled. I didn’t even think about that until the last second of this moment of the moment.</p> <p>I wanted her to give me this gift, and I would have given that to any other woman.
