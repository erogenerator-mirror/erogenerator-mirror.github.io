My heart was beating so fast that I could smell the fear in it.</p> <p>The next morning I dressed in my tighty-whities as usual and went out to play golf. One of the guys from the other night showed up to tell me how he wanted to get laid. I told them not to take me up on my offer so he left. I left a big smile on his face when he left.</p> <p>Before I got to the house I went into the bathroom to shave before I got out of the shower. I pulled on my black leather mini skirt and my black thigh highs before I headed out to play golf.</p> <p>It had been a couple of weeks since I had taken a shower so I was feeling pretty ragged. The only thing that I had on was my makeup and it gave me a great feeling of mystery. I had always been pretty reserved about my appearance and now I was wondering as to what she would have on her that this wasn't my typical body.</p> <p>My husband was gone a lot so I figured that he had been out all evening with another girl. I had spent all of that time watching TV when the doorbell rang. I almost ran to answer it. My heart was pounding as I looked around the house and noticed that my neighbor Jennifer had gone to her room with our neighbor Steve.</p> <p>"Hello Debbie," I heard him say as I opened the door. "This way," he added before he had a chance to put on what appeared to be a night shirt.</p> <p>"Hello Steve," I answered.</p> <p>"Debbie, this is Steve. Come in Steve," he replied as he led me into our house.</p> <p>"I am so glad that I got home tonight," I said as I took his arm.</p> <p>"Have a seat." Steve told me as he walked in the living room.</p> <p>Steve was an older man about my age and he looked about 70. He was wearing a pair of slacks and a loose fitting shirt that appeared to be a bit of an old-fashion shirt. He had on a pair of very nice loafers and had a beer in his hands while he spoke.</p> <p>"Debbie I would like you to meet Jeff," he said as he gestured toward his friend Steve.</p> <p>Jeff was my friend and he was about 30. Jeff had some weight around the middle that appeared to go on for miles. But at the moment he was in jeans and looked like he was in his mid-30's. He had a short, thick hair tie that was hanging down. He was very athletic looking and his eyes looked to be the color of old-time military boots when he moved.</p> <p>"So what do you do at the moment Steve?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm here on a business meeting. I haven't gotten lucky in a very long time." He replied as he looked at me closely.</p> <p>"I guess that makes sense," I answered before he could give me a better answer.</p> <p>"You don't have to do this. I have something to do." He said looking at me expectantly.</p> <p>"Just go home. I have something to do, but I can't see you," I answered as I walked to the front door.</p> <p>"Well if it was a business meeting and Jeff was on a business meeting I would have come home sooner," he said.</p> <p>"No kidding," I said as I opened the door for him and then walked him to his car.</p> <p>"Do you still want to go to my place or should we go to my place," he asked as I headed into his house.</p> <p>"Please Steve. I really need this kind of company right now." I replied as I shut the door.</p> <p>Steve sat there in the living room waiting for me, but I could tell he was going to get the worse of it.</p> <p>"Come here Debbie," and with that I took him by the hand to lead him to the bedroom.</p> <p>"Jeff told me that you were interested in me. Do you want to fuck a little?" I asked as I sat on the edge of the bed.</p> <p>"That's not what I meant. I mean do you want to fuck?" he said with a confused tone.</p> <p>"Sure Jeff doesn't mind when he has company. I think that he already has my pussy a little bit wet." I replied, as I began to undress.</p> <p>I watched as he took my last article of clothing and tossed it aside. His eyes were fixed on my chest and I could feel his stare burning into my skin as it was almost a full inch from my breasts to myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
