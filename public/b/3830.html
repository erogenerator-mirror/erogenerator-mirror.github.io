He was driving home in no particular order, not that he was taking any chances, but that he felt the urge to do so. His mind was working in slow motion, and he was so tired from the journey and anticipation of what he would do that was going to happen next. He had no idea how his wife would react to what he had planned, and he had no idea of how he would handle it when it did. There were still lots of things he wanted to do, and even more things he wanted to do; but first he had to get the hell out of the house, so he gathered up his things, went into the bathroom and undressed.</p> <p>He showered in the bathroom and started to feel very self-conscious. He wasn't a very tall man and he was fairly light in the waist but it was just fine, he had a good muscular body. He also had a slightly plump face with deep brown eyes and a slightly crooked smile. He hadn't shaved in a week so it was pretty damn smooth. He brushed his hair carefully and let it out of the ponytail he had gotten in his bathroom and put some powder in his nose. With a couple of drops he rubbed himself in a special way that gave him that perfect aroma. He applied a small dab of powder to the head of his cock and worked a dab on it with one hand, then some on down it with the other hand. He then slipped his left arm through the top opening of the towel rack and slid it behind the towel. He knew that the view of his wife that night was spectacular and that would keep him satisfied for the rest of his life. As he opened his hand he pulled the top sheet down so that he could reach under it. He carefully slid the sheet off his head and then slipped the other hand under the pillow he always preferred to lay on his back. "Oh God," he swore to himself. "That might just work. This isn't going to feel like a date."</p> <p>He had a big fat bed that he slept in, and all of his neighbors could see into the bathroom with the lights on in the window. It got very warm out there in the late afternoon and even at night it was difficult to get warm in. He pulled the heavy curtains aside and slipped in behind as usual. His wife had never complained of being cold, so he figured that it must have come as a bit of a surprise to her that he had decided to bring up the topic of sex at breakfast. He heard her giggle, as he snuggled up behind her. He turned over and put his arm over her back and spooned up between her and his pillow. He knew that at this moment in time he didn't have the heart to tell her about his fantasy of fucking her, he just felt a slight tinge of jealousy that was nothing compared to the feelings he had the night before.</p> <p>He knew that she was lying and his heart gave a flutter. He put his arm under her right and cupped her left breast, squeezing it gently through the tight tee shirt. "I really shouldn't be doing this," he whispered, "but I don't feel like I should stop. I just can't. I'm sorry, and if you hadn't told me about my fantasy tonight, this might not have been a good idea." She pulled her head to the side so she could get a good look at him. "I really needed to tell you about the dream about last night. It kind of got me there too. I think I should have come in and told you about it. It was kind of sweet of you to ask, and thank you for allowing me to come in. It's been wonderful."</p> <p>"I'm glad to hear that. That means a lot. I know a lot about you, too. It's no big deal, really." He reached under her top arm and put his hand on the bottom of her breast. He could feel her nipple hard and hot under his fingers. "I'll keep it hidden for a while. I love having you like this. I can't explain why I want to do it, but something in me wanted to ask you. I just haven't had a chance to really ask you about any of this before now. I felt really guilty about it last night, but I can't explain it anymore, and it's not something I would ask you to do for me. You know where I go wrong with it."</p> <p>"I want to say something, but it's very personal," she said as she took his hand and put it directly on her nipple. "What is it with you and your fantasy, and your body, and your dream about going into my bed with a naked woman tonight?" She took a deep breath. "I want to feel that you. And I'm sorry I ever felt like that. You're the most beautiful man I've everâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
