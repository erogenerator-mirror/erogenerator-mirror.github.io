I'll... it won't..."</p> <p>"No, don't."</p> <p>"It's impossible," Mike said, looking up again, his brown eyes still glowing, "It's impossible not to... see it is... it's impossible not to... know it is... is impossible not to... to think... to know what its going to do to me and..."</p> <p>"Mike," Sarah said, a little too loudly, "please explain." Mike's eyes opened wide with surprise and fear as if there was a moment of pain when he saw Sarah. She had her bra on under her blouse. "Please, explain to me what it's going to do to you, Sarah," he repeated. It didn't take long to come to terms. "It's... it's going to make us... make... me... you know to... fuck. No... NO, Mike. Don't." She was crying, but Mike didn't care. He was too afraid to cry himself. He was frightened she was going to go through with it. She was going to... make... me... make me do it. She wanted to. She looked at him, seeing his face, and was afraid that he was going to turn away, but it was too late. "Mike, it's... no... it's impossible," she murmured. Mike looked at her again.</p> <p>"You can't. No, wait, Sarah," he said. "We can't. God, please, please don't. I can't. Don't. God. Please, Mike... tell me it's going to be that good. We can't do anything else... we can't think about it..." Mike just couldn't say it. Finally he managed. "It's gone inside, Sarah," he said. He saw fear in her eyes again. "It's going to... put... to... you... oh, so... close, doesn't it." Mike looked at her, and heard fear in his voice. He had hurt her badly. He knew now that he wanted her to have an orgasm.</p> <p>He kissed her forehead. "That was very good. I really enjoyed it, but it can't... it could not happen again." Sarah's face was so red that the tears were dripping onto her face, too. He thought of something as he hugged her, but he couldn't. "Mike," Sarah said, "Please don't do this. Don't." Mike moved over her body to stand next to her. "Mike," Sarah murmered as tears rolled down her cheeks, "I... I'm... in love with you." Sarah's sobbing was broken by Mike's fingers in her hair. "You're mine, love." Mike ran his fingers through her hair, enjoying the softness of it as he did so. "Mike," Sarah's voice was soft and trembling, "I... I love you." Mike leaned down and kissed her tears, hoping to comfort her. Just a second later he felt her hand between his shoulder blades.</p> <p>She took his hand and placed it atop her. "No," he said, "touch me. Go ahead." Mike was stunned. He pulled away and ran his hands across her body, trying to reassure himself and her and try to make sense of what was happening. He kissed her, but as quickly as it might be, it was replaced by another, yet another kiss from her. It was a kiss of love, and desire and longing, he would never forget. It was as if each of them had come to find and accept the truth of the other, and they had found and trusted each other. He put his arms around her and held onto her. "I love you," he said in the same breath, but without the sobbing. "I can't believe it." He was almost afraid to say anything else and that's when he remembered that Sarah was a virgin. "What are they doing, Sarah? Is there something between them?" He had never seen her so hurt and miserable. And he had never seen her so happy. "I'm not the one who's being hurt," he said, "you're the one who's loving me and who's loving me, and I'm the one who's afraid to hurt you because I'll make you stop, because I can't stop loving you. What do they're doing?"</p> <p>Sarah's arms had been tightly around Mike's neck, but now she wrapped her legs around her lover's hips and he took the lead, pulling her toward him. She looked up into his eyes. "It's not hurting you at all, Mike. It's... it's just... I love you." She was sobbing harder now, tears rolling down her cheeks. "All that pain from when you felt the thing pushing... into you...
