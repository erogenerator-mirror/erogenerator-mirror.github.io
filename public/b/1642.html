I never felt anything like it was with Dave. I have never been good at it, and I’m glad I found out about him some time to do it to myself. I didn’t get over that.”</p> <p>“Me too,” Rebecca said. “Now you know for sure what I did wrong and that I would never do it again,” she continued.</p> <p>“But you are right,” Megan said. “I did want to.”</p> <p>“And now you know.” Rebecca said as she kissed Megan’s other cheek.</p> <p>Megan was still amazed at the fact that she had never experienced anything like the sex Rebecca had described in her experience with Dave. And so far, she had only had the mild touch of her own body and never the real touch of a real person. Maybe this is what a woman had to give to a man that way. She couldn't say that about Rebecca anymore because she had no idea she would ever be capable of doing that with a real person. But, there was no way she could say that to a beautiful man who was just her first ever lover with no strings attached.</p> <p>Rebecca reached out to hug Megan, kissing her lips. “I’m so glad I asked you to be my wife,” she said quietly.</p> <p>There was a sparkle in Megan’s eyes as Rebecca lifted her hand and brought the wet fingers to her lips, then put it back on Megan’s lips.</p> <p>“I love you,” Rebecca said, kissing Megan’s cheek softly.</p> <p>They kissed and held as Megan felt the heat and the passion of Rebecca’s lips against her own. The kiss was tender and unassuming at first, but the love and affection soon blossomed into a passion that overwhelmed every fiber of their being. Rebecca looked into Megan eyes for a moment.</p> <p>“Thank you, babe,” she said softly.</p> <p>They held each other and Rebecca kissed Megan again. When they finally separated they were both breathing heavily and she could feel that she was about to hyperventilate, but she forced herself to control her movements.</p> <p>“It's okay, babe.” Rebecca said, holding her close.</p> <p>After a minute or two, the need to breathe returned. Megan reached up with one hand around her neck and caressed her neck with the other. Rebecca slowly stroked her way over both of Megan’s beautiful breasts.</p> <p>“You have beautiful breasts,” Rebecca said softly.</p> <p>They held each other and kissed again. Then Megan got up, turned around and got on her back. Reaching between them with one hand, she grasped Rebecca’s breast and softly rubbed the erect nipple as she ran the other hand slowly down Rebecca’s breast.</p> <p>Megan stopped for a moment and looked at Rebecca's face for the first time. Rebecca smiled as Megan slowly lowered herself down to her. Putting her arms around her, they kissed one another longingly. Megan’s breasts were more than just perfect: full and firm and inviting. Megan’s nipples were tiny and almost red and erect; their tip poking straight up.</p> <p>Rebecca was the first to open her mouth and slide her tongue into Megan’s mouth. Megan’s tongue met and intertwined with Rebecca’s as they shared a long, hot kiss. Rebecca’s kisses were strong and passionate, and Megan was as close to being able to taste her own juices on Rebecca’s tongue as the last minute. Megan kissed her back passionately as she rubbed her fingers on Rebecca’s lower belly. Rebecca’s hands moved downward, slipping off Megan’s blouse completely. Then they caressed Megan’s breasts and moved up, brushing over her breasts and stomach. Megan's hands never stopped moving on Rebecca’s breasts. Megan was always very responsive and Megan knew she would cum if she wasn’t told to do anything.</p> <p>Rebecca stopped kissing Megan long enough to reach up and grasp one of Megan’s nipples, then she pushed it, too gently and said, “I like having you like this, honey.”</p> <p>They kissed as Megan caressed her breasts, gently caressing first one nipple then the other with her palms. Rebecca’s fingers were exploring Megan’s body, running from her belly button down toward her pussy, and then back up to her breasts.</p> <p>“I hope you like how this feels.”—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
