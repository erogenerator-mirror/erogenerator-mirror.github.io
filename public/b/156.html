I could feel myself turning dark and wet in my panties like the day I got here. I'm not even ready to be dressed yet. I'm not sure I want to show off my body to a stranger. But I'm here, and I want to make her proud, and I want to make her happy. We both know what I need. I want her to be proud of me. I want to be proud of us both for joining in on the wonderful adventure we just gave to others.</p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 9</p> <p>The two of us are standing naked in the doorway of their house, still naked from our hot tub encounter earlier that night. The woman who started our little game is my husband, and this is what I've been thinking about for the last couple of days. She smiles as I stand there with my husband's cock in my hand, which feels as though a thousand years of pent up energy is coursing through my body like a storm. I can barely contain the excitement that has been building for so long, it is too much. I am nervous and excited at the same time.</p> <p>At one point my neighbor walks over and stands in the doorway of my living room, naked, as her husband's cock rises to join me in giving us pleasure. The look in her eyes tells me that all's right with the world...except for her. I turn to see that her husband and his friend are standing there, naked, facing the door. What is he thinking? Why is she there?</p> <p>I reach out with my other hand to take the man's hand. We move up onto the couch, and I lean down to kiss him again. His cock is soft, so I run my hand along the length of him, and then around his shaft. We share another kiss as he reaches all the way around and cups my face in his hand, pulling me forward to kiss him deeply.</p> <p>I feel his hard cock in my hand, and I run my fingers around the smooth, soft skin of his shaft and head, as my mouth descends upon his. I am very excited at the thought of his cock in my mouth, and his friend's. I continue to explore his hardness with my tongue and lips, knowing where to lick and suck, and where to gently tease his balls with the tip. I feel something in the back of my throat and I take him into my mouth as far as I can. I work my mouth and throat muscles to swallow as much of his member as I can. I know I am pleasing him.</p> <p>"Oh, my God, you are wonderful," he finally says as his friend pulls his mouth off of my face and looks me in the eyes. I am amazed, and yet so turned on by them both. I know what they want and I want both of them at the same time. I smile at their approval and I feel something for us at the same moment. This is what I was going to do. I can't get enough.</p> <p>The look on their faces as I get down on the floor in front of them, is incredible. The look of sheer delight, lust, excitement, and excitement on my face all combine to make every part of my being tingle with excitement and delight. My husband looks over to look at his friend and I can't help but smile to myself. He must be thinking of something to say...maybe he just saw something that wasn't there. We're both looking forward to what is to come, and we can't wait very long.</p> <p>In another minute or so they have me bend over on the floor with my hands behind my back, my head slightly bent backward, legs in the air, while a third man steps between my legs. The first man reaches behind me, and I feel his strong hand on the upper part of my leg as his thick cock makes its first contact of my pussy. I am now spread eagle and completely naked, waiting for them to take me. I feel both of them kneeling behind me with their stiff cocks inches from my face. I am loving it.</p> <p>"Oh, God, yes," I hiss out, as a long, hard cock stretches my wet cunt, stretching it to the limit before plunging into my vagina and penetrating deep. I am getting as excited as I'm already feeling. "Yes," is all I can mumble as I feel them penetrate into me. "Yes," again I reply to their eagerness, as I continue to lick both ends of their rods, kissing them as they enter me, all the while watching the expression on their faces as their cocks penetrate me. They are all hard too...and I can feel it. I'm so turned on.</p> <p>The man on top of me begins to thrust his cock into me again. "Yes!" I exclaim, "Fuck me! Oh, God, fuck me!" The man is ramming hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
