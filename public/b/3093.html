I can't possibly stand in the way of your love making, can I?" His voice was soft and reassuring.</p> <p>"Yes you can," I said softly. I leaned forward and kissed him as my lips pressed against his, and whispered, "I love the taste of you on my lips."</p> <p>He kissed him back and I felt his cock surge in his slacks. I could feel the pre, and what was inside, rise again. It was hard and swollen, with a wide ridge that extended to his belly button. The head rose and fell with each heartbeat. I could feel the heat from his body wash in the air. I ran a finger from his ear, along his cheek, down to where that ridge met his neck. "It burns," I whispered again.</p> <p>He raised his head and looked at me. There was that smile again. I looked at him and saw a passion in his eyes that surprised and embarrassed me. I ran my fingers along the ridge of his collar bone and slowly, slowly he rose, until his nipples had grown in the cool night air. I had to close my eyes and picture the feelings that were coursing through my body. He had just taken off his shirt, and was reaching down to pull it up over his head. His head was bent slightly, his arms stretched out and held tight. His eyes were on fire. I wanted to reach out and grip them, but I didn't know how. When he stood completely still, his cock was fully erect, standing upright, its head pulsing against his belly. I ran my nails gently down either side of it, feeling it jump slightly. I wanted to put my mouth to it and suck it. It was throbbing, pulsing, and it was pulsing strongly, like it was going to explode. I felt my own breathing deep and fast.</p> <p>"Take off your clothes," he told me. He was obviously trying to control himself and keep the anger in his voice as he said it.</p> <p>I hesitated only briefly. "Just one," I whispered. I was not sure what I wanted or what he wanted, but knowing that he was angry was turning me on, and my knees felt shaky. My arms were shaking. "It's been so long," I continued. "Oh," I added, "how I have wanted to do this. I never knew it could be so exciting."</p> <p>I opened my arms and he leaned forward. I took his face in my hands and we kissed. I touched my lips to his and felt it run a trail through my palm. Our kissing was passionate and urgent. His lips moved into my mouth and slid over mine. I was in ecstasy! When he pulled back his tongue slipped between my lips and probed at my own. I moaned and ran my hands down his face. I was lost, but I was so hot from our kiss that it was a little awkward to touch him again. He kissed me again and his fingers found the zipper of my robe.</p> <p>"Take it off," he told me. I looked at him. I knew he was angry, but the look on his face was that unspoken lust that only comes from a powerful man who is angry with you.</p> <p>I shrugged my shoulders and the robe fell to the floor. I stepped closer to him, leaning forward and running my hands over his chest and down over his stomach. He lifted his arms and the robe slid off my shoulders. He knelt back and slid the robe straps off my arms. He looked at me and asked. "Will you let me see?" I hesitated. "Sure, if you want."</p> <p>"Of course I want," I whispered. I had not been able to speak for the last few months. This man, this stranger, was looking at me with lust...the way you did to me. It was all I could do not to jump his bones right then and right then. I leaned forward and kissed him again. After a long moment I moved so that I was between his legs and he stood up, as I knelt before him. I reached out and felt the bulge of his cock.</p> <p>As I held it with one hand, I reached with a fingertip and slowly ran the very tip of the head. I ran it down the head of his cock and his whole shaft. There was a drop of drool on it, and I reached out and licked it off. His breathing was heavy and irregular. I could feel his erection swell as it grew in my hand. I ran my tongue up and down his length, and heard him gasp. I moved his cock farther into my mouth and felt its head against the opening to my throat. I let his cock rest there, and looked up.</p> <p>"My god," he said, "you're such a tease!"</p> <p>My eyes were afire. I had never done this before.
