This was a great place to start up a business. He was thinking up a few ground rules and whatnot. He knew she had told him, and that was okay with him.</p> <p>"Yes, sir, that's okay." He thought it too, but she wasn't quite ready for the conversation to come to it just yet. He didn't know how he was going to react. First he was going to have to get her to see this, and he had no right to have her do things she didn't want, even if they were on her own terms. Now he had to deal with a whole new problem: a situation that was almost entirely his responsibility, but the fact that he couldn't resist it was very bad. He had always thought she was pretty, when he first told her he didn't care how she dressed. It wasn't so much that, since she was dressed, or he would have a hard time not being interested in whatever she was wearing, but he'd have to say it first.</p> <p>"Sir, there is no need for any formalities. I assure you, in just a minute, that I haven't been with anyone special, and if one of my best clients was as well provided for as your wife is, then I would consider our little discussion over." He watched her closely to see how she would interpret this.</p> <p>"Yes, sir. There are no formalities." He wasn't sure how she really felt about it. Maybe after all this time she would finally speak to him, but still, that didn't make it worth his time. "I'm pleased to be of service to you, and I am very pleased to be serving you, even if it isn't every time, Sir." She nodded, and he couldn't fail to see the slight smile creep over her lips as she said the last word.</p> <p>"Sir, if you would like a moment. Could you... I'm sure I'm not ready for that yet." He wasn't sure whether it wasn't his imagination, or if he really should do it.</p> <p>"Why?" He could see the wheels turning in her head, and he was so nervous it almost made his heart ache.</p> <p>"Sir, I... ah, well, maybe once the week begins, maybe I'll let your wife... I'd like to have a weekend, to see if we can keep up our... arrangement."</p> <p>"We can only keep our arrangement for a weekend, to give me time to... set things up. Why don't you show me your room one day? That way, as soon as you can spare the time."</p> <p>"There isn't a thing for me to have a hotel room. It's my vacation. I do my work around the house, and I'm sure that's not one of the best in the world." He could have given her a million dollars to go out and find someplace, and that way, she wouldn't have to worry about getting a room, since she was in such good hands. "It sounds so easy."</p> <p>"Well, I did some sort of business in the past few weeks, and I have been told that I can manage to get everything set up." Her smile grew as he replied. As he spoke, she smiled and said, "Let's see."</p> <p>His smile was a bit more genuine than he was comfortable with. Not sure why, but they did seem to communicate well. No one would believe that he was a cheater, especially now that he felt that he did.</p> <p>"This way, I have got the view." He took her hand and pulled her towards him to get her back to the bed, where she took off all her clothes, while he watched. Now he was taking a chance, since he didn't know if she was in any hurry to get back to the hotel. He was so relieved when he saw that she hadn't taken off her bra yet. It was more than nice to look at, but this was going to be fun. She was going to need to be comfortable, that she wouldn't want to be out naked with a stranger.</p> <p>He pulled up her negligee, which was white, so that it covered her, and helped her lower herself onto the bed. She turned and lay on her back as he pulled her into his arms, and they kissed, again. This time, he didn't bother kissing her as they pulled their clothes off with a haste, and as soon as they were naked, they jumped into the arms of each other, holding each other tight as they kissed.</p> <p>Then they separated, so as to get their breath back. It was then that he said, "It will be very easy to explain to you, so you will know that I have taken all my clothes off, and that I have given you my complete trust... even if a week isâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
