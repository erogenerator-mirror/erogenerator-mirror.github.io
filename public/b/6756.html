After pulling away from him she gazed into his eyes for a second and asked, "How do you want me?"</p> <p>The last three words he had made last night were coming back to him, and he couldn't stop his hand from slipping down to his hard shaft. She stared him intently for several seconds, then whispered, "Fuck me."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes! Fuck me!" she exclaimed and jumped up on the seat and straddled his lap, taking her hands and placing them on his face, pulling him down to kiss her with some urgency. Her eyes rolled back into her head and she closed her eyes, her mouth opened slightly and he kissed her again, running his tongue around her lower lip in a teasing way, then pulled away slightly and looked down at her.</p> <p>He moved her to the center and she spread her legs as far as they could go. "Do it." she said, as he leaned in and took his cock in his hand. The head of his penis touched her bare pussy. He was surprised at how wet she was and she was already breathing hard, breathing hard. He felt her fingers run through his hair as she moved his head closer and closer to her, her pussy lips parting on either side each time he brushed against them. Suddenly he lunged straight up into her and she moaned as his stiff penis penetrated her. He could feel it throbbing in the wet warmth inside her and he began to move it in and out, making sure the whole length of it was stuffed inside of her.</p> <p>She put her hands on his chest and leaned into his movements. He leaned in and kissed her again as he moved his hips in small circles, enjoying the feel of her nakedness beneath him. She tilted her hips a little and he felt the tip of his penis touching her anus, then felt the slick smooth flesh of her pussy as he did. She leaned into his movements and moaned lightly.</p> <p>Suddenly he rolled her onto her back and positioned himself on top of her. Now they moved, sliding their bodies together as he pushed his hips forward. Each move of his hand against her body caused a subtle jolt of pleasure from her. He could feel her wetness against him as he slid inside of her. With a low moan she reached for him and clutched him tightly, locking their genitals together, feeling his throbbing hardness inside of her. With a final squeeze, he pulled out again.</p> <p>He moved backwards and she sat up on the arm of the chair, spreading her legs. He ran his hand down her belly and under her ass to find her clit and begin to stroke it. As if in slow motion, he moved his hand higher up her smooth skin, until he reached her breast. He rolled her nipple between his fingers and leaned down to suck it in.</p> <p>"Oh, John. Yes! Don't stop! Make me cum!" she said as she arched her back and lifted her hips upward, trying to force his cock back inside of her.</p> <p>"No. Not yet." he said, still stroking her clit with his thumb. He looked at her and took a deep breath. "Look at me."</p> <p>She met his eyes and then smiled back up at him. "Oh! Oh, John!" she said, leaning forward once more, her tongue sticking out and reaching his lips. "Let me make you feel good!!"</p> <p>He leaned down to kiss her lips again, then pushed forward into her again. His hips moved in a small motion, and she gasped each time his dick rubbed against her clitoris. He pulled back halfway, then plunged it firmly back into her. Each thrust of his hips drew more of her juices down onto him, coating his hard organ.</p> <p>"Is that what I think it is?" She whispered into his mouth.</p> <p>"Yes..."</p> <p>"What does it feel like and what it feels like to be fucked by you?"</p> <p>His hips rotated faster toward her, driving her with every stroke, causing her clit to bump with each stroke. Her breath came out short when she felt his finger push into her anus, moving around in a circular motion. She moaned softly, biting her bottom lip and raising her hips upward, trying to force his hand inside her.</p> <p>"I don't think... oh!" she said as he pressed forward, moving his dick a different direction than what was going on. Her legs tightened around him as she moved again, her pussy sucking his dick each time. His hands were on her hips, moving back and forth in a blur.</p> <p>"Yes!" she groaned again, as her head leaned back and she started her orgasm. "Yes! Oh, god! Take me! Oh, make me cum!"</p> <p>The force of her orgasm drove him deeper inside of her and as she began to comeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
