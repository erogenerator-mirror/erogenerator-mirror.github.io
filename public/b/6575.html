She had her arm around my waist and was looking at a picture I found when I came back to the apartment. It was still there with no faces. Then this thing. She looked. Was that her. My phone was at my neck and my camera at her left, and the sight alone made me lose it. Just like the picture but with a darker skin tone to it.</p> <p>I had just gotten back when the phone rang. I thought it was an emergency in case I had to pick up her and I didn't say anything, but when I saw her name I went ballistic. She was my dream woman, my goddess. I mean, she was that way, that little devil. Oh her voice was mesmerizing. That same deep voice that can make you melt in it's smoothness. She looked so alive and in that moment I was scared. I knew it. I knew I was dreaming, that I was not so much dreaming I was dreaming. Or perhaps, I was not so bad.</p> <p>Then, I saw a couple guys looking at us talking on another phone. They were obviously looking at our phone. I felt that this was not so hard for me to figure out. I could imagine a world of fear I would never know. We had talked on the phone several times before but it was very clear we never met in person. I would be sitting beside her, my legs crossed and I saw her looking at my phone. And I could picture how it looked. It looked amazing. It looked so real. I would say it was perfect but I would just say that it was her doing it, not me. I didn't care. She was just doing the same thing I was doing in my head.</p> <p>So, I asked her what she wanted. She started saying it was her choice. At first, I was still confused. Then, I realized that she was not doing anything, that she didn't want to do it. I told her I still wanted it to be her. She smiled and I pulled her hair and pushed my tongue into her mouth. She pulled back just a little at first, but then she slid a hand towards my groin to squeeze my cock and squeeze it right into me. I was rock hard, no matter how hard I tried to not cum. Her hand felt good, that little touch of hers. I could not get close enough to take her in my arms.</p> <p>But I could not take my eyes off her, her beautiful face. Her eyes, the sparkly, blue color of the night sky and my eyes. Oh, her face. I was staring intently and her smile was bright. Then, there was her voice. She would call us all night. She would come in and see us. They would say she was in need of us to come and look after her. I knew they would be saying the same thing but at this point things were not going to be good. I felt like if I didn't take action, I could never really be her.</p> <p>Then, after a few minutes she said, "Ok, so that sounds good," and then she was looking at the picture again. So I put down the phone, leaned over, kissed her softly, and whispered, "Ok."</p> <p>I turned and she grabbed my waist from behind. She leaned in to kiss my cheek, my lips and then we locked eyes. As we did that, she looked in my eyes and my lips and we locked. Her legs were still around my waist as she pulled up tight with her arms. I felt an intense urge to kiss her but I kept my eyes shut.</p> <p>When I kissed her, the passion I felt in those moments when we both took in the other made me feel as though we did not want to do this. Maybe, it was her eyes. Maybe, it was the way that she just smiled or her lips. But, when I closed the distance between us, I could feel my heart in my chest. It started to beat very hard. I kissed her. In the moonlight that shone through the window, my arms went around her from behind. Our kiss was passionate on the spot but strong. Our mouths locked on each other and our breathing began to become heavier.</p> <p>Our hands went up to her breasts and we cupped them with all the strength we could muster. Her nipples were hard, and when my hands rolled over them, almost as though she were pulling on them. Her smile broadened and she pulled me to her harder. We continued like this for another twenty minuets without moving. Then, our hands stopped, and I pushed her away. Her eyes met mine. I felt the desire inside of me. Her hands were still on my back and her eyes were smiling. And for the first time in nearly twenty years, I saw the love in them. The love that I hadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
