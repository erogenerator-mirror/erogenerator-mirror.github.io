The hot water served to create several small bubbles, which could be used for lathering before getting it all over the body.</p> <p>Soon, she put the towel over the top. He was still on top of her, facing her, and she knew that he was still completely embedded inside of her. "I want to do you doggie style." He said in a low, urgent tone.</p> <p>"Are you sure you're OK with that?" She asked as she pulled the towel away.</p> <p>"Of course I'm sure," he responded slowly. "Come here, I want to kiss you," he said.</p> <p>They kissed tenderly, her hands caressing his back and ass. His hands moved down her body and her lips met his as her fingers touched each nipple. When she reached her pubic bone, she could feel his dick throbbing inside of her. They spent time on each other's breasts and pussy, sucking, stroking and fondling.</p> <p>By the end of the night, her husband was a man possessed. He continued to do her with slow, long strokes, until she could hold her breath no longer. He pulled out and moved to her side, then moved around, knelt facing her as she lay back against him and wrapped her legs and arms around him.</p> <p>His mouth followed as he kissed her belly and thighs while his fingers touched and pulled on her tender nipples. She was in heaven as he worked her from her toes to her clit. He stopped briefly to kiss every inch of her flesh, sucking upon the very tip and driving her to a frenzy. By the time his tongue licked down, she was coming so hard that tears were pouring from her eyes with the ecstasy of her pleasure. Her arms were wrapped around him, trying to pull him closer. He didn't even bother to suck upon her breast as he lifted his head. "Oh baby, I love your sweet sucking..."</p> <p>"I... can't... wait... for you to explode into my mouth. It must feel all the worse because you... must... be... still holding... me. And... I am so... close... again." She looked up at him and said very softly, but with full sensuality, "Give me... baby... give me... your cum. Fill me with your cum."</p> <p>His hips began to lift up and his penis entered her again. "Don't hold back," he croaked. "Fuck my wife." He urged her on as the pace quickened, making sweet sounds as he entered inside of her deeper and deeper.</p> <p>Then he moved his hips into her one last time, and they both went off... and... and... he was deep inside of her as the first wave hit the end of their passion. "You... you feel... so... big... inside me," she moaned softly.</p> <p>"It's... too... big." He responded as they finished. "I must go," he whispered. "Your lips..."</p> <p>"Yes," she moaned. He kissed her and rolled off of her.</p> <p>She lay there, feeling his seed drip off of her as she whispered, "I'm sorry I have to be so late for church tomorrow." When she had finished her confession the next morning, she saw that he was already dressed and waiting for her. Without saying a word, she got up and began to walk toward the door. "Hurry," she said to him. " I don't mean... to take a long time, I don't want any of that stuff to be... I need to go..."</p> <p>"Let me." He grabbed her arm and escorted her to the car, pulling her up into his arms. "I can't leave... till I get home tomorrow," he said huskily.</p> <p>"Yes, me either. I'm tired. I've been sleeping and I need to get a lot of sleep. We can do that soon, when we can see what's happening on the TV."</p> <p>"We will. Good night," he said as he walked to his bedroom.</p> <p>With just her shoes on, she pulled her shirt over her head and reached behind to remove her bra with one hand. She held it up, to the side and then tossed it to the floor.</p> <p>He came to her, and kissed her with a fervor. He was not about to let her go just yet. He pulled off her shorts, and sat down in the car. She was still wearing only her boxers as she moved her ass in his lap to straddle him.</p> <p>"Please, please, I love you." As she said this, he pulled her toward him, lifting her ass up enough to enter her and began to do her. The passion within them ignited as he felt his dick throbbing and becoming painfully erect.
