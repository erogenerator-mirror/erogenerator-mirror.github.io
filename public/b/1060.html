She finally opened the top and brought her hands up to her chest. Her heart raced in her chest as she realized that she was now the woman. She squeezed her tits together as she looked into the mirror again and again. She could not see any of her own in it, but she couldn't imagine her naked body anywhere else on the planet. She was almost as far from naked as anyone, in spite of the fact that it was an empty existence compared to what she had.</p> <p>"Well, so long as I don't mind being the only one naked, then it can be a free world," she thought as she slowly leaned back. Once she was leaning back, she slowly pulled the dress back around her waist and stepped out of it before carefully stepping into a pair of heels that she placed on the dresser. She glanced back at her dresser and saw a tiny scrap that showed through the opening on the other side. There were no more than 3 or 4 large slits that hung from the top of the dress.</p> <p>"Oh crap," she mumbled under her breath, "I'm too late to pay for this, I'm already in that dress."</p> <p>She looked over to where her phone rested on the dresser and saw that it was on the top drawer. Turning the phone over to examine the contents of the phone, she noticed a small piece of glass sticking out of the glass frame. It was a tiny piece of glass, just so. She was so nervous that she could not even imagine what might be on it. She looked back over to her dresser and saw the small piece of glass and the thin piece of glass falling to the floor.</p> <p>"Oh! I'm sorry! Oh... I... Uh... No, no, that wasn't right!" she said, suddenly aware that her head had dropped, "it has to be a mirror so that... I couldn't have done that"</p> <p>"I'm so sorry," she said a second before taking the glass out of the dresser and looking down at the glass. "I'm not a girl."</p> <p>"Oh no, you are not?" she asked him nervously, "you're a beautiful woman, just as much as you are beautiful and you don't know what you're doing to yourself, when did you turn into... I don't even know that, you just..." she stammered, "You're a beautiful woman."</p> <p>He gave her a warm smile and she smiled back, taking a drink of her wine and taking it herself once again from the crystal in her glass and pouring herself a glass. Looking at the glass as she took a sip, she could tell that everything was making her feel as though she had become some kind of goddess, and that she should be grateful that she had. "I'm sorry?" she said again, taking another sip of wine. "Oh... I... I, uh, I don't understand, I can't pay for this, I'll pay this, I'll..." she stammered. "I'll make sure that I'm paying for anything I need now."</p> <p>"You just have to be patient," he said as he continued to look over her as she walked around the room. "It's just this, when you start to feel uncomfortable, you need someone to... to help you. I don't know why you don't understand."</p> <p>There was some real discomfort for him, and she could sense it in it. He was worried that she would be upset by what would cause her to feel so unsure over something that she had no idea about. And she was worried that he would be upset that he couldn't seem to help her. "It's just, after what you just did, I felt like just going to a gym or something to help you. I didn't mean to hurt you. I... I just thought it might help me... get over something that I think I haven't been looking at. I just... It's just... it's just that..."</p> <p>"It's just a glass of wine," he said, cutting her off. "The only thing that makes something better is the alcohol. You have to take it. It's all you drink."</p> <p>He looked up at her as she got up and began to walk towards him. "There are some other ways you don't know," he said.</p> <p>"But," she said, "I can't walk around the room all day with an ass like this." she said as she reached the foot of the stairs.</p> <p>"I'm sure you can," he said with a grin and another look up at her, "but I'm going to put some clothes on first to make up for not paying for the outfit."</p> <p>"That's a bit unusual," She said as she stopped in front of him and put her hand on his thigh. â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
