I had never ever had another orgasm that intense. I collapsed on the bed and was completely spent. For the next few hours I tried to get my head over with all the events of the past few days, and then go home. I could feel myself falling asleep in my lover's arms.</p> <p>"That's a lot more than we ever talked about," I said to myself once my head was clear.</p> <p>"Hey, what time is it?"
