I'm sure by the time you're about to give me one, my knees would be aching, wouldn't they?" She teased him. They were silent for a while; she could feel his eyes on her legs, then his eyes glancing her as she walked, and the feeling of his eyes on her as she walked took her breath away.</p> <p>"I think I'd like that...I mean, you should be able..." she said, looking into his eyes. "That's it; it'll stay like that. You'll have a very nice and comfortable seat when I first massage your legs. You can sit here, just enjoy the attention my hands are giving you." She giggled, "And yes, my legs are a bit weak, so I'll be right back." She looked up at him, "So...um...isn't everything just 'naughtier' this way? You'll let me do this then, huh?"</p> <p>"What do you think?" He said. She was right, he'd never let anything near this personal before. Her hands slid up his thighs, and down, then back to gently stroking the smooth skin of his legs. He didn't answer her, as his eyes were fixated on her crotch. She smiled sweetly, and he leaned in towards her to kiss her cheek, before closing his eyes, to let her have her way.</p> <p>"I can tell by the way you're trying to hide yourself from me. You're really not afraid." She chuckled softly. She reached behind her back and undid her bra, letting it slide down her arms and on to the floor. Then her body was pressed up against him, and she felt his hot, young body, pressing against hers. His hands slid up her body, her breasts. The fingers on his index fingers cupping her breasts, she felt his lips press softly to hers. Their lips met, and they kissed with their warm, wet bodies, with their soft, sensual mouths pressing against each other. She could feel his firmness, her breasts were warm against him, and she pressed herself into him with her groin. His hands slid over her body, from her shoulders down to her butt, to the small of her back, and he squeezed and squeezed her, pulling her closer to him. His erection was now pushing into her groin and she could feel it as hard as she could feel him. His lips were on her neck, his hands were on her breasts, and she could feel his hard penis between them as it pressed against her belly. She could feel her pussy getting wet with him. She could feel his hot breath on her skin as his hands slid down to her buttock and squeezed, pulling her into him.</p> <p>Her own naked body seemed to be getting hotter as she felt herself pressing into him. His mouth pressed into hers, and his tongue pushed into her mouth, forcing it between her lips, and then slid up her jaw, to her ear. She could swear he sucked on it as his fingers slid over her ass, to the inside of her thigh, then up to rub around and under her crotch. His cock was pressing hard against her and she could feel him throbbing against her, and a new wave of heat washed through her and she realized that she probably shouldn't be feeling turned on like this, but her body felt more alive, and the feeling was almost exhilarating. She felt that warm feeling between her legs again as his lips trailed down her neck to her shoulders, as his fingers slid down her thighs. When he pressed his hands into her thighs, she could feel an intense rush of desire. He was touching her in an intimate way she'd never experienced before, not even with her own fingers. Her breasts were pressed up against him, and she could feel the hard length of him pressing up against the top of her mound, his fingers moving over her clitoris.</p> <p>"Mmm, you sure are wet already," he cooed in her ear as his mouth moved from one ear to the other, his breath hot on them, his lips warm and wet.</p> <p>"Ohh, you're going to enjoy this." She whispered playfully as she felt his hard penis rub a finger through her. Her arms slid around his shoulders, her hands on his chest, and she pulled him towards her where they were both on the bench, their legs pressed as close together as they could be.</p> <p>She could feel the pressure of his erection against her through his pants. His fingers squeezed her inner thigh while their lips pressed together, and he was moving his hand under her to cup her right breast. He squeezed her nipple between his fingers and thumb and she moaned. They rubbed against each other softly, and her head was spinning from the excitement and the sensations, and so was she from the feelâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
