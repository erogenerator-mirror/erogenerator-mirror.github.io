I am in complete bliss, and really happy. I just want to be happy like this always, but you can ask for anything. I don't really know how much of a change you are seeing my life take but I know how much it will take.</p> <p>Your friend in Australia and all that, "Hello, this is Chris." (She's always the nice one)</p> <p>And a couple of days later, when I am home alone watching some music videos (I'm actually good at putting on the video that day), I can tell that something is different about me. I can't put into words, but right now my heart is telling me that things are ok. I guess that I just know that I love my new new life and I can't keep doing this. It's strange though that I have this feeling that life doesn't exist for me. I wish that I had a whole different life. I know that you can't help the way I feel. I guess that maybe things haven't been exactly like before.</p> <p>When I get home on Saturday, I see that you've been waiting at the door for me. I smile as I open the door and we kiss. We hug each other and we hug and it's more affection than a goodbye. After we sit down in the livingroom, we talk some more, and then we make our way to your room. We start to undress each other and start to kiss and taste. As we kiss, I notice that it takes every bit of strength to stop myself from unzipping your pants, but after the show we did, I don't want to seem like I'm doing it for a reason. My first chance, I just have to play along. I have to have a taste of what is to come before it happens. So, I just have to take what I want and go for it.</p> <p>I move to pull down your shirt and I can see that you're not wearing any underwear, so that's really nice. I pull down your pants, and then I find your soft, warm cock and I start to stroke it, all over. It has grown to about eight inches, so you're all shaved. You are circumcised so I know that you're not fully erect and that you didn't jerk off at all. It turns me on so much that I want to do it myself but it's so weird, to do this. I'm so close to doing it, and I can feel that when I start to stroke your cock, you will be hard even through your clothes. I'm so into it and I don't know why it bothers you to take off your own clothes. We are both completely naked, and I want to get you naked, so there's no going back now. I just wanted to touch you and see what it would feel like, and then we can start to feel each other. After that, we are just playing with each other. I'm so happy to have met you.</p> <p>After we start to kiss again, I can't get over that you are so hard, and I don't think that it will go away. I can't wait to get to play with you even though it has to be slow and gentle while I'm not fully hard.</p> <p>I pull off your pants, and then I kiss my way down your torso. I want to lick and suck your cock. You know I like to give head but I like to do it all the time. You're so hard that by the time I get down to it, your cock is sticking straight up in the air, and if we had a camera on, I would have recorded this. I start to lick your cock head and make sure that it's coated with my saliva. I start to take your head into my mouth and work a bit with my tongue. You can feel my wetness getting on your head. You get that feeling that you get when a girl makes you really hard. When I get your cock all the way down my throat, I know that you are completely hard and that I must be really good at sucking cock. I do it all. First slow, then faster. The first time we're with you, I was not sure that I could do this. I know I have no practice at it, and you don't know it yet. But I'm sure there are a lot of other places that just work in a woman's mouth that I can learn to do. I work on your cock for a while before bringing it back into my mouth and working you over. I could give up and give up, but that's just for later. You want to hold back long enough to enjoy the pleasure, but you are going to take a minute or two before you start to really cum, so just let it build up for a while until after a while and you can really enjoy the orgasm.</p> <p>You start to moveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
