You're not looking just to have me take you out on the town. In fact, you're looking at it a bit like you do to me. You might even be my daughter."</p> <p>Kathryn giggled. "I guess so," she said, "because I do too. Do you think you might want to take me on our honeymoon to Europe? And what is a honeymoon? I don't remember that one! Is it possible you might do us some favors... maybe a good deed of sex?"</p> <p>"Of course, you know I did, sweetie. Of course. We'll have things to do, and you'll have things to do too"</p> <p>"It might even be fun," she giggled again, "But where are we going?"</p> <p>"Well, we'll have some fun, I guess." Kate said as she took one last sip from her wine. Kathryn looked around as she sipped her wine. "I guess that's it. It's just a matter of time."</p> <p>"Just a matter of time? You know! Just wait and find out about it."</p> <p>"Just wait and find out about it!"</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>Kathryn was on the phone with one of the local banks when she finally got ahold of her aunt and uncle. "Hi, Aunt Edna!" She replied cheerfully in the local office, then paused for a moment to make sure that her mom was still in the vicinity. "Are you still there, Aunt Edna?" She said, trying to inject some humor into the call and avoid offending her by turning on the charm, "That's me!"</p> <p>"I am, and Kate and I discussed the plans of the honeymoon with your mom today, sweetheart. That's an announcement to be made, but it's certainly not going to be over quickly and painfully. I'm still here."</p> <p>"That's nice." Kathryn responded again cheerfully. "This is actually sounding pretty good actually... if I may say so. It's really going to sound pretty nice, Aunt Edna. It's very exciting and interesting to talk with you about it," she said in a matter of fact tone, "and I'm not sure if you'd like to hear some of the plans I had for the fun and the opportunities we've been exploring."</p> <p>Aunt Edna was already calling the local businesses that were interested in buying Kate and herself a house. However, at that point, Kate's aunt was busy being interviewed for a job in Boston. "We really wanted you to have been able to join us and help out. We know you'd be happy to. We'd be disappointed if you wouldn't. Actually, Kate and I're pretty excited to be spending time with you here. I'd be flattered if you wanted us to take you into the city."</p> <p>Kathryn's stomach rammed up when she heard that, especially after Kate's statement about wanting to meet her mother. "Aunt Edna, you'd do that for me? I would love to help you out!" The image of Kate making love to her came to her mind and she recalled how sweet and tender she had felt when she had lain with him when they made love the first time she was a girl. "I really would love to get to know you a little better."</p> <p>Aunt Edna laughed as she answered her daughter's question. "Of course you'd get to be able to see you. We'd be proud of you for that!" She responded happily. "We sure would!"</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>Kate and her uncle were both excited after their encounter. Kate had been especially excited because her aunt had agreed, at least in part, with her idea that the two of them would be sharing the honeymoon with a friend of theirs that they were both planning to marry very soon. "If we're able to talk it all out together, we can even decide that it would be a better idea than the last idea."</p> <p>Kate had indeed agreed to meet her mother that day. "Mom's not sure if she has any idea if you'd want to go with us. She can't go on about 'why a woman doesn't let a man put his cock in her' without getting a little excited!"</p> <p>"It's just that I've been a little hesitant about the idea of having you join us, being alone. I know we'd probably probably get a little jealous and I don't want you to feel that your mother is going to ruin your happiness if she ever discovers we have a couple of 'girls' at home!" Edna said in an attempt to cheer her up for going with the two of them. "I'm sorry, Kate.
