"Come on!"</p> <p>"I don't know if I can," I said, half out of breath from the excitement of everything, and half out of a sexual overdrive.</p> <p>"I don't either," she answered. But I knew the answer. She took off her jacket and dropped it to the floor, just as she had before. She tossed her coat to me, and I caught it and it too. When she was completely naked, I slipped my hand into my pants. "Take me with you?" she asked. At first, I didn't think it was a question, then I started to feel the tingle in my penis.</p> <p>"Yes!" I said. "As you say."</p> <p>Her fingers found my penis and she began to stroke it while her tongue swirled around the head of my cock, and at the same moment, my hand moved into her blond pubic bush and found a pussy that I had not had in many years, and she was wet before even my cock. My finger found her vagina and I rubbed her clit and she gasped.</p> <p>"I want you!" I exclaimed.</p> <p>We fell onto the bed, where I was on top. I had my cock in her mouth, and we kissed for a long time while my hands explored the soft flesh of her belly, her tits, her ass, and I was getting ready to do other things with her too. I wanted to explore her body, but she stopped me.</p> <p>"Take off my clothes first," she said.</p> <p>I did so, and she lay on top of me, and we kissed, and caressed and stroked. She put her hand down to my cock and caressed it, and then she put her lips on top of it. She began to lick and suck and massage me. I rolled her over on her back, and I knelt between her legs.</p> <p>I kissed and sucked her nipples, which were very long and had a big brown areola. When she had them fully erect, I kissed her nipples and licked the areola, and I licked the ends of her breasts, and her hands caressed my face and my body. She rubbed the back of my chest while I licked and sucked her tits, and I could feel her breathing increase.</p> <p>I moved down to her pussy lips and began to lick and suck them, and she moaned and writhed and raised her hips. Then she raised them to her, and sucked my tongue inside her, and I licked the tip and her clitoris. She raised her legs to her tits and I lowered my head, and sucked the bottom of her pussy, licked her pussy, and took her clitoris between my lips.</p> <p>She screamed, and thrust her pussy up at me, and then I felt her body begin to shake. I continued licked her, then, and she climaxed, and began to come down from her high. She lay there, still, for a moment, and then she began to kiss me. I lay there a moment, and then she began to kiss me, and I had to use a hand to pull my face from hers so I could kiss her. My tongue found hers and we kissed, and rubbed and explored each other.</p> <p>"I'm going to get on top, so I can kiss you and touch you," she said. "And then maybe we can do this all over again."</p> <p>"No," I said. "I want you from behind."</p> <p>She rolled up on me, and I put my dick in her pussy, then I pulled her onto me, and we started to fuck. I lifted up on my knees, and she put her hands under me and she pulled me into her, so my dick penetrated her. We fucked like this until we felt our orgasms coming.</p> <p>"I just had a thought," I said, "could I call this night together?"</p> <p>"If you think you want to, I hope you do," she said, and she kissed me again, and then she got off the bed; I got to my feet.</p> <p>"I'll take that as a yes," I said.</p> <p>"No, I didn't mean it like that," she said. She got dressed and we got dressed again, and sat on the bed together while we kissed and caressed each other.</p> <p>Later, when we fucked again, the thought of making love with other women came to me once more. I hadn't done it with another man yet, and I was afraid it would scare her. When I thought I'd been too prudish, I kissed her on her forehead and cheekbone, then her cheek, her nose and mouth, and on the mouth.</p> <p>She turned to go, and I took herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
