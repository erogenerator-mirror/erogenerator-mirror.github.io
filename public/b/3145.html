I was hoping you might be going to the lake sometime in the next six days and I think we might need to talk," she said and paused. "We might even miss having that time together."</p> <p>"Actually, we have the whole thing to finish off today, if you want it," I said, trying to hide the excitement in my voice. "You're welcome anytime."</p> <p>"And I was wondering why you weren't joining us in the tub," she grinned. "I saw a look in your eyes that morning. I figured it might be something interesting and then we're all getting ready to go."</p> <p>"It's kind of an awkward situation, isn't it?" I said. "Don't worry, we won't be having sex any time soon either. I wouldn't worry about you finding out right away. You just have to ask."</p> <p>"Well, I don't know," the brunette said tentatively.</p> <p>"I don't either," I assured her. "Let me explain how this started. I was a little disappointed that it ended up here that the first day, but since we're here now, it was only that you were on the water. The girls were in the tub and you probably had a hard-on for a while!"</p> <p>"I'm sorry if I embarrassed you that way," Kara chuckled.</p> <p>"It's ok. I guess there's no need to be sorry. I was a little nervous that you might start seeing someone," I added.</p> <p>"Oh, it's ok. I guess I've thought about it," she smiled. "We never used to be like this...in public."</p> <p>"I'm surprised you're still talking about it," I replied and leaned forward next to her on the sofa. "I mean, what are you thinking?" I asked.</p> <p>"I don't know," she leaned forward, placing her hand on my thigh.</p> <p>"I want to ask you something," I said. "Are you interested in me?"</p> <p>"Of course," Kara answered. "Anything. Whatever you'd like to do."</p> <p>"Ok," I said and leaned in even closer, pressing my face against her cheek, closing my eyes. Then I put my hand on her bare thigh; sliding it upward to caress her inner thigh.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" Kara asked. She was a little nervous, sitting with her back against the wall like most parents would. I reached up and rubbed her shoulders gently before letting my hand move down further under the shoulder straps and up to her boob. I slipped my fingers in between her bra cup and her soft, white breasts. Her hand went to my lap and took hold of my cock, which was straining against my shorts. She let out a soft gasp against my lips as she felt my warm, wet fingers, squeezing on her flesh.</p> <p>"Kara, we can't do this..." I murmured.</p> <p>"It didn't feel bad to me," she reassured me. She leaned back into my arms, turning her head from side to side.</p> <p>"I'm not sure that I like it, but I do have a little something to ask you," I told her.</p> <p>"You don't have to do that," Kara said, breaking away, stepping back. I saw her back, hair combed back, her breasts spilling out of the top of her bra, the tight fabric barely containing her nipples.</p> <p>"You should be asking me, not that I can help it," I admonished her. "It might make it less embarrassing," I added.</p> <p>"Can't I just have my boyfriend tell me?" she asked. "Please don't tell anyone, please?"</p> <p>"I'm going to fuck you if you let me," I assured her, sliding my hand to her bare crotch, feeling the warmth. "Kara, this is a new relationship we're having."</p> <p>"Please," Kara whimpered at my touch. "Let me do something with you," she said softly. "I want to do a lot more than just fuck you."</p> <p>"You know it might surprise you in the end," I told her, letting my hand slip beneath the elastic waist of Kara's pantyhose.</p> <p>"I know," she mewed as she slipped the hand out of her pantyhose; turning toward me. Her lips were pursed as she looked at me. Without asking, she leaned into me. Our lips pressed together in an urgent kiss. I took in her long hair as our soft lips parted. Our chests brushed together and I pulled her closer. Our breathing deepened as our heads slid slowly along each other's cheeks and neck.</p> <p>Kara broke away from my lips, allowing her hair to cascade forward in long, braâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
