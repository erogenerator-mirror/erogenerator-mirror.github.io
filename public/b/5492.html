She was going to go on and on. I told her I didn't think she did something in her work, but I needed to do an answer. I pointed down to my lap. I had been reading my paper, and I had a good book on history and history. I could see something about the writing she was writing, but I couldn't quite make out what my thoughts were exactly.</p> <p>"Oh, I think she's just making up some story."</p> <p>I had never had any trouble interpreting her statement and had no intention of having an answer.</p> <p>"And you think she didn't steal the book because I gave it to her?"</p> <p>I guess I was confused. I couldn't quite get her to say something like that. "Maybe." If it was something else and someone else had told her, then we might understand things.</p> <p>"But, how does saying something like that change things between you and Jack?"</p> <p>"I don't think it does. You know, it's hard to explain. I don't think she's a serial killer, at least not anything I'd call it. If she had the chance she would have told me."</p> <p>What an ass.</p> <p>"And in fact, I think you did more than just steal the book because she took a lot of crap from you a couple of months ago."</p> <p>This just made sense.</p> <p>"Maybe if she had tried to sell it, like I did to her, her attitude would have been different."</p> <p>It didn't really work out. But it did change everything. I got a little excited, knowing that maybe, someday, something different would come of it all. Maybe with a good reason, I would have tried to sell the book some more. But, I didn't even know if she would do something like that. She would have had to have done something different, something that had happened before. I was a little excited too, knowing that I wouldn't be able to explain it, so the thought of talking it out was just a little too good a thought to actually think back on. I finished my paper and went to get another one, and I didn't bother to read it at all, because I wanted to give her the time and the chance to think about it.</p> <p>She came back with another piece of paper, folded and was laying on her desk when she came back into the room. I handed her a copy of it, and she took it and looked at it. It took her a couple of minutes to compose it, as it wasn't an easy process. When she was done she looked up at me and asked if I was still interested in her, and of course I was.</p> <p>"You already did that for me," I replied, "but I've got something else to share with you with. You don't share a book, do you?"</p> <p>"No, it's hard to explain. I suppose if you had done something else a lot of the time, and liked the results, I don't think you knew why you couldn't make your own book."</p> <p>It was like I thought she was being defensive. "I wasn't paying attention. Anyway, I thought you might still be interested in the book, or at least you thought so."</p> <p>"You had your own opinion? I think you're the one that wanted to do something about it," as she looked up at me with that same kind of stare that I was getting from her every morning.</p> <p>"I didn't want to take a chance that you might ask someone to move in. You know I'm a good friend, and you know I care for Jack and would never be jealous." I couldn't seem to help but smile at my first response to that.</p> <p>"Well maybe I should be flattered, that you're interested in him."</p> <p>"That's why I'm interested, too. Anyway, the one you wrote about the book, was probably mostly about your boyfriend getting laid by another girl. You know, that kind of fantasy."</p> <p>Just for an instant I was sure this conversation was going to get awkward. That's when I noticed there was a hint of a smile on her face.</p> <p>"Well, you know, I think you're very pretty and sexy. We could just have a good time."</p> <p>It was her turn to be taken aback, but not as much as I had expected. The first part of it was she smiled at me and told me she had been having an interesting day.</p> <p>"I've been thinking about what you might think about me for a pretty long time. I feel like a young girl," with that I went back to studying the notes that would be hers for the afternoon. Maybe she was going to copy them and we would go our separate ways? Did I dare?</p> <p>"I'm glad you liked itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
