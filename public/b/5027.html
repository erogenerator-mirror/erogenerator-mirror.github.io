"Fantastic! And you'll be surprised just what an earth-shattering orgasm it is."</p> <p>"I haven't had one ... yet." I chuckled. "But if I'm going to be a man again, I want it now!"</p> <p>"Really?" She nodded knowingly. "And I want to feel it before I feel it, too, of course!"</p> <p>"Oh, darling!" Her eyes got big. "I'd really love that ... but can we stop for ... well, now?"</p> <p>I pulled her onto my lap and we kissed once more. Then, as we kissed, we fondled each other, which I do to a wonderful first time as a male. And our kisses were absolutely sensational.</p> <p>When we were kissing in front of my desk, she started fondling my ass, which was rather sore and I found that I liked to take things slow ... even though I knew it hadn't been all that long since ... but since then, I had started on a regimen. And it was very hard ... very, very hard at first, but when I took it really slow, it was incredible. And it never took me long to get the nerve to take it hard. I think it was about the size of my cock, as I think it is ... that would be a bit awkward as it stretched my asshole so tight. But I managed ...</p> <p>As I moved my hands down her back to her lovely behind, I was surprised to feel her ass cheeks expand a bit so gently. And though I was somewhat shocked by the initial tightness, I found it to be really erotic, which I could feel myself react to the sensation.</p> <p>I felt her cheeks relax a bit, but it was not painful, and it didn't hurt, just seemed ... not uncomfortable. She certainly felt good. I felt a bit aroused, but also a bit scared ... at the same time.</p> <p>She pulled my face down to hers to kiss me, so I pulled back so I could kiss her lips and her face, and to kiss her ear and her neck. And my hands slid down and felt the full, heavy tit flesh, and to the nipple of a hard nipple that seemed to make her taut nipple stand out even more.</p> <p>Suddenly, my hand was on its own, and I felt a little shock as my hand slipped over it, and that I felt hard, almost erect, as I started to caress it ... but then ... it seemed as though she stopped me ... and she just pulled my hand back ... and she kissed me on the lips, and whispered, "Now, baby."</p> <p>"Yes!" I grinned. "But I really want for you to lick me. Please."</p> <p>I did ... and felt her lips on mine, and then feel the moistness from her mouth against mine. And feeling how wet she could probably make me ... and the slight pressure she had placed on my cock ... and how much of her mouth I could hold ... that I might just blow my load ... I licked her mouth, and then kissed her hard on her teeth ... and then sucked her tongue into my mouth. My hand dropped from her other breast and went to where I could fondle her pussy ... and felt the moisture there ... and when I was doing that with my fingers, she was arching her body up to me. It looked as though she wanted it.</p> <p>I think the idea appealed to me ... because of the way she had taken control of the situation and felt about me. But it hadn't been just a blowjob, I had enjoyed it immensely, and it was more arousing for her to want it, and to have me doing that to her ... and for her to love it ... and enjoy it as much as she was loving it.</p> <p>I could feel her juices soaking my fingers and on her hand ... then on my fingers ... on my hand, and all over my hand ... and that made me feel even more excited than I was myself. Her hand on my hand was making me hard ... and that seemed to drive it even more ... and she just kissed me even more wildly, and it felt as though her hand was pulling my whole body up and down on me. I felt the tremors of excitement go through my whole body and felt a wave of tingling in my pussy from where she was touching me ... and I really didn't want that feeling to stop ... but it still felt exciting ... so sexy ... and I pushed her body toward me.</p> <p>She didn't stop me ... she took over ... and let me get closer ... and I did ... and was thrilled ... at the feel of her hand on my cock ... and at the feel of her mouth on my mouth on mine. I was still holding her breasts and felt her kissing me and licking me there now ... even as I felt her hand on my hard cock ... and all the while sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
