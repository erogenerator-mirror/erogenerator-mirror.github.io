You just want to fuck me, to cum deep inside me. Don't worry, I'm on the pill, it will feel amazing, I've been with guys, it's normal for my period to not be. " she continued. I couldn't believe she was whispering to me, that she knew my period, as did I. I started wondering how much her pussy did feel going back to it, I thought we might need a condom to stay in there, I had never gotten a vasectomy.</p> <p>She pulled back on me very slightly and whispered again "don't cum inside me. Not until after I'm sure you are ready, and that I am safe to have you inside me." We both fell asleep very quickly on the couch.</p> <p>I woke up with a start, and realized she was fast asleep in the same bed as I was in. I had never gotten a chance to sleep with her naked when I was asleep, but now I really wanted to. I quietly got up, and quickly slipped my hand between my legs and started rubbing my pussy. My first orgasm had happened many years ago, I didn't know anyone else had been able to do it that way. I started thinking of the times I had let guys in my back yard at a party, with some of the guys there, even having been in the living room of the backyard, even trying to get me into a gangbang in the dark.</p> <p>Suddenly I had an idea. I got up and went to the bathroom where I found one of the extra pill bottles I keep, and had it ready. I layed down on the couch, spread my legs, and I pulled the panties out of the way. I had always considered this position to be a one time thing, but apparently that was not in my line of thinking. I quickly took the pill from the bottle and placed it on the top of the night stand that nightstand, and placed a couple of pill bottles under the pill bottle, and slipped a few fingers in my pussy again. This time I didn't care, as I just continued to fuck myself slowly on the pill bottle. Suddenly I heard a moan come from her and the next thing I knew she was having an orgasm with my hand, just like I had last night. As she started to shake, as did I. I think it was more of the same. I couldn't believe another woman was going through such a powerful orgasm. My fingers started working harder in my pussy, and I could tell she was as close as she was.</p> <p>Suddenly the other pair of pill bottles went from the night table to the side table, and we heard the sound of two mouths working on my other nipple. We both had orgasms together at the same time, and I finally felt the urge to take her into my arms. I got up on my knees and kissed her on her forehead, and whispered a small thank you. We got dressed together, and she asked if I could wait for her for a while longer. "Of course I will."</p> <p>As I was walking back to my car, she said, "you had your fun with her"</p> <p>My heart stopped, as at that moment it broke in two. "Can I call you?" And then she said it out loud and asked me if I would be willing to consider it later in the yearâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
