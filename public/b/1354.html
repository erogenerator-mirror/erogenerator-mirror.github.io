"Mmm. You keep doing that so well, but I think I'm going to leave you there for quite awhile." She kissed him again, before leaning away. "By morning, we should get you ready," she said, reaching for her nightie. "That's where we're going to do it."</p> <p>Catherine quickly shed her nightie, dropping it on the floor beside her clothes and standing naked before him. "Do you approve?" she asked as she stroked him through his shorts, her mouth following the curve of his face.</p> <p>He nodded as his hands found her breasts once again, squeezing and gently kneading them. "I think you're incredibly beautiful, Catherine," he said. "And it's not fair for you to wait until Saturday to feel better."</p> <p>"My plan is to use the night off to relax you... a lot." She kissed him again, and he kissed her back, his hand sliding under the waistband of her panties. He tugged them down with one hand, exposing her pubic hair and her wet, swollen lips. He felt a little dizzy, and said, "Let's go. We need to make a proper entrance."</p> <p>Catherine led him down the hallway, opening several large doors and leading him into a large bathroom. "We can get you started in your room," she said as she handed him a light wash cloth. "I don't have much to use."</p> <p>"I'd probably like that," he agreed, running the washcloth through his hair. "And I think we need to put an air balloon in there."</p> <p>When he entered the small bathroom with the water running, he noticed that she was already standing in the center, holding a wash cloth up to him. "You don't need this, Catherine," he protested, then grinned at her. "There's no way I'm going to use it when we start up again." He had already started stripping off his shorts, letting them drop a few inches to the floor. "What about if I put it on you? It'd be easier to walk."</p> <p>She kissed him for several seconds, then reached into a bag and took out a large bag. "I want to use this," she said, handing it to him and pulling out one of the large white plastic towels. "That'll be great for this one," she said as she began rinsing the towel against his skin. As she pulled the towel up against his body, she said, "And the smaller one," and he quickly stepped into it.</p> <p>"I think your butt has always been in perfect shape, Catherine," she said, squeezing her hands together. "And to see it for what it is without the towel and underwear doesn't help me at all." She handed him the smaller side and washed him, his erection bouncing in the water for her. "The smaller one..." she looked him up and down. "It's the most romantic, romantic thing either of us has ever done. You're quite a man. And I don't have the equipment to use it." She washed his lower back and thighs, then slipped her arms around his hips. "There, now we're both dry and clean," she said, pulling back. "And you ready for this evening? We don't have much time." With a shrug, she turned her back to him and let the water begin to run.</p> <p>He was still drying himself against the mirror when his cell phone rang. "Catherine!" he said. "This is going to sound awful, but I'm going to be up in a minute. I was actually looking forward to this." He smiled as she picked up the phone, then glanced down. "Hello?" she asked, waiting for the second incoming call.</p> <p>"Hey, Cathy. I just wanted to let you know that I'm taking tomorrow off. I'm on my way out!"</p> <p>She laughed as he hung up the phone. "I'm glad you decided to bring the balloon to New York. I was afraid to bring the balloon all the way out in the rain." She leaned against the mirror, letting the water run down her back. "Well, good luck, I guess. But if I was going to be here all day, I might have been kind of late. Or I might have been late at night, too."</p> <p>She turned to face the mirror once more, smiling with excitement. At least her plan was going according to plan. She opened her nightie a little and began to rub her breasts as she looked at her naked image. "Well, it's not too late," she said, letting the water run over them. "Besides, I wouldn't want to ruin my day by being late."</p> <p>"It'll be a shame if we were late," he said, thenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
