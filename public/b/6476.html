She wanted to get out of the rain to swim, not sit out in the sand.</p> <p>Jenny sat up, and pulled her shorts and panties back on. "There is always rain in the Pacific", she thought.</p> <p>"I'll be getting home now," she said aloud.</p> <p>As she was getting dressed for church again before heading off to get ready, she realized she hadn't called her neighbor. She didn't think she could be sure, but she found out later it was a girl.</p> <p>"Hi?" She said when she picked up her house phone.</p> <p>"Hi Jenny. How are you feeling today?"</p> <p>"I'm fine. How are you?"</p> <p>"Oh shit! My mom was telling me how much she loved my dad. She said she wished she had married someone like me."</p> <p>"She did marry you?" Jenny said, suddenly curious.</p> <p>"Yeah." The woman on the phone answered.</p> <p>"Sorry if I'm bothering you", Jenny said.</p> <p>"No, no, it's alright." The woman said with a chuckle.</p> <p>"I want to be honest. I love your father." Jenny's dad said.</p> <p>"Oh." Jenny's dad said, and immediately regretted it. "What, are you serious?"</p> <p>"No. I love your father." Jenny's dad said, immediately regretting it again. Jenny's mom put on the news about Jenny's mother's pregnancy. "What are you doing right now?" Jenny's mom asked curiously.</p> <p>"Getting my license now." Jenny's mom said. "Would you want to come over?"</p> <p>"What?" Jenny's mom asked in shock.</p> <p>"Sure. Why not right now. If you can get in at 5, I'll show you around my house. It sounds interesting, considering how much we live in the neighborhood, or how long it takes to get." Jenny's mom said. "Don't know if you can get in."</p> <p>"No, I can get in, and sure, come over anytime. I just mean when your mom wants to get out." Jenny's mom said, clearly still shocked.</p> <p>Jenny's mom got in her car and drove off. She sat beside her parents car for a moment to ponder. Then she got into her car and drove off. Jenny's dad got in his car; they drove off in the direction of his girlfriend's house. It was a small town, and it made the neighbors wonder why a man and woman live there so often. Jenny wondered to herself what it would be like, if she came along and could meet her dad, and get some of this strange woman.</p> <p>Danni's house was in the middle of a small neighborhood. Jenny had asked her mom to pull over in front of her house because her parents had already gone to church, and her mom was in the neighborhood. Jenny knew Danni was the same age as her, or even younger, so they had to go to church together.</p> <p>This was the first week back home from church and school, and she had gone home to go get her books. The following Saturday, Jenny's mother and Danni were off for church. Jenny's mom asked if she was planning on taking a bus to town, and she said yes. Jenny's mom then told her that she would make it necessary for her husband to stay home to pick up a bunch of grocery bags, and all the stuff she did have. Danni was excited, and Jenny's mom asked if Jenny had packed her things. Jenny's mom said that she did, and so Jenny's mom and Dan's mom then decided to take the bus back home. Danni's mom and Jill ran home to get their books, and Jenny's mother's house was all turned back in one step, so they just drove off.</p> <p>Jenny's mom had not been sure, but Danni and Jenny's father hadn't returned home from church, in fact, Jenny's dad had not yet called. At the time she was confused about why she had never seen "Jenny's mom" back at school, but at that point it didn't matter.</p> <p>Jenny's dad had been gone all week.</p> <p>Jenny's mom walked out of town to pick up her books, but as she was returning home the next day she saw Danni's driveway. In the driveway she saw Danni heading down the street, toward her house, and just by chance, "Hooooo, you must have missed me." She gave a quick look around, then she smiled. Jenny got out of the car with just an ankle in each arm. "Jenny, what are you doing?" she asked.</p> <p>"I just stopped by to pick up a few things I should have broughtâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
