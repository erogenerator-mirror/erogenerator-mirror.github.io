I wanted to see you."</p> <p>"I've got a surprise for you,"</p> <p>"Oh, sweetie, you don't need one, too much would make you do it right away."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I've got my own room."</p> <p>"But I don't want to live in your room!" I said, suddenly feeling more vulnerable as he walked through the door, his eyes burning into my breasts as he turned my back and pulled me towards his bed. We fell back with me on top of him. I felt his breath catch briefly as I slipped a leg around his hip and rested my foot on the leg of his shorts. I was now at the top of his crotch, his hard dick pressed against me. I pulled them both to his sides and pushed my hand down inside his shorts, feeling his dick throb against me.</p> <p>"Your dick has been hard!" I muttered, as his fingers wrapped around my leg, and up under my skirt.</p> <p>He pulled aside my panties a little, then his fingers began to explore, sliding down, searching for my pussy. He rubbed a finger around my clit before finding it and putting it directly on my hole.</p> <p>"Oh, god!" I moaned, not caring that it was only in my imagination. He held my hand now and guided my finger to my clit. I rubbed myself as I brought his cock up along my leg. I could feel how wet I was already, my panties becoming quite damp as he massaged my pussy, and he slipped his finger into my warm, waiting cunt as far as it would go. It hurt, but it was also too good to be true. I could feel my excitement build, as I rubbed myself against him.</p> <p>"I want you," I whispered.</p> <p>"I know."</p> <p>I sat up on him, then stood up as he wrapped his arms around me, squeezing me so tight his fingers were almost breaking and turning them inside me. I turned around and took off my pants, as he unzipped me and pulled out a condom. I knelt down on the bed, in one quick motion, then quickly turned around and went to one of the chairs. I turned around as he pulled me to him, wrapping my arms around his neck and pressing into the kiss, not letting go as long as I wanted.</p> <p>"Where are we going?" I whimpered in his ear, his tongue running circles on her ear. I could feel the heat of his erection between my legs, as my hand played with his butt.</p> <p>"The first bedroom." He whispered, and pulled me in for a short kiss along with a kiss on the cheek. I walked to the top of his bed, where he pushed me to turn over, spreading my legs apart. I lay on my back as his mouth found mine, our tongues wrapping around his. I could feel his tongue sliding along my slit and pushing at my clit, as he slipped first one, then two fingers in and out of me. My moans were echoing around the walls of his bedroom, as I felt him working his cock into me as I felt him slide his mouth up to my breast.</p> <p>"Oh, god," I groaned into his mouth, then felt him pulling his lips away from mine to take my nipple into his mouth. His hand worked my clit as he began to suck on it, biting a little with his teeth as he bit a little bit harder than he had on my nipple. Soon, I was moaning in time with his mouth as I lifted my knees to my chest, as his mouth returned to my pussy, my hips bucking slightly as he worked me towards my first orgasm. He didn't stop until I screamed and climaxed loudly.</p> <p>As we lay together, he pushed me to my back. Lying me down, his mouth found my breast again, leaving a hot trail as he licked and sucked at my nipples. I could feel the wetness oozing from my wet lips as my body responded to his touch. I couldn't think about anything else, except that one thing.</p> <p>"Oh, sweetie,"</p> <p>I looked him in the eyes as I pulled him to me, pulling his mouth to mine, our lips met and lingered there for long momentsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
