"He's your boyfriend." With that, I reached behind me, grasped his cock, squeezed tightly around its shaft and then slowly rubbed it up and down. "I think he likes it," I commented, with a wicked grin and then released it. "Just let me have a go...I know you do too." I got up on my knees, got on the bed with my back on the bed with the pillows behind me and my tits hanging down with just a small line of perspiration running from my belly button with each breath. "No, don't move," I instructed him. "Lay on your left on your back, in the middle. Don't move." I lay back and then raised my legs and put them over his. He pulled my hips back so that he had full access to my wet sex. I let him tease my outer lips for a few seconds and then lifted my body out of his reach before lowering my legs again. I wanted him inside of me, but he was slow to take me.</p> <p>I had never been penetrated, but knew it was always just a matter of time. The cock in my pussy would slide in and out gently with occasional thrusts on my inner lips. The cock would always slide in slowly. The cock would press against my G-spot and I had never had anyone else's cock in my pussy but theirs...but he was there. I reached down and put my hands on his ass, pulling him to me. His shaft was all of seven inches! He looked so good inside of me! With a gentle push, I felt him slide deeper into me. I had never felt him in so deeply or any otherplace...oh my God, he was so deep! My orgasm was getting more and more intense and it made him pump me so much faster. It was so different to being with him in your pussy. I felt like my whole body was being squeezed and then relaxed. As I climaxed, I could feel him stiffen up inside me...my eyes met his. We looked at each other for a few seconds, smiling as my pussy tightened up on his cock, pushing his cock deeper into me.</p> <p>"I love your pussy!" I exclaimed happily as I felt his cock throb in and out of me so slowly. "I love the way you feel when you're on your back with your legs wide open." I kissed him and then moved my face over to his. I kissed him very soft, very gently on the lips. I wanted more. I wanted to make him cum, to feel that intense, wonderful sensation again between my legs. I moved down his body, kissing my way down to his neck and then down his chest. I began by flicking my tongue on his nipples. Then with soft, gentle kisses I teased them with my tongue, then the nipples, down to his stomach and thighs. My hands held his body in place while my tongue explored every inch of his thighs and stomach. His penis was still deep inside of me! I began licking and then kissing each of his thighs and then the inside of each leg of his leg. I moved to his ass. I licked each of his ass cheeks. He moaned out a groan and I realized I was doing it right. So warm and soft, yet so hard and big in fact. His butt was round and smooth, with no sign of a lotion skin. I licked away at his ass and then licked my way up his body. I felt his fingers holding my head as I slid my tongue down on the inside of his thigh, the other way to his balls. I could hear myself moan as I licked, kissed and sucked on his cock and balls. My heart pounded and my breathing became heavy. I could sense the moment had come and I wanted to give him as much pleasure as I could.</p> <p>I reached up to him and cupped his face in my hands, turned him so he was facing me and then gave him that loving look of mine. I gently lowered myself until my wet sex felt his cock once more.</p> <p>"Ohhhh, Ohhhh, that's incredible!" I moaned as my hips were moving up and down on his shaft.</p> <p>"I'm glad I'm doing this," I said as I kept his cock in my pussy.</p> <p>I moved off his body to kiss him again, then kissed my way back to his lips...and then again down his body. I began kissing down his body as I kissed all over him. I could smell his cock on his breath while I was on his legs below. I was a bit surprised at how excited I was as I kissed down his body, past his feet, his toes, his toes, then went back up to his toes and then his legs. I did the same to his feet, his feet...and then back up to his legs. He was completely nakedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
