A thought came to me just as I was heading for bed: maybe it was just that the sexual thoughts were so deep and intense.</p> <p>I looked at the clock. It was almost 9.</p> <p>Just before 10:30 I opened the back door of the house and walked in past the bathroom. I didn't see Mrs. Carter, but she came out of the door and closed it behind me. She put the kettle on and went to the kitchen to get another coffee. She came back on to the bar-top where she was sitting and as she turned to lean on my leg I reached out and put my hand over hers. Her hand rested on mine as if it was to say, 'No, I don't want that, I don't want you touching me like that.' And as she had before we kissed. It was not that we were kissing, I still could not. I was actually caressing her there where only the hand would reach.</p> <p>'Do you remember that time in the library, when you sat with me and we kissed?'</p> <p>'Of course, I do.' But it was too weird to think about.</p> <p>'I'm glad you felt better. Come back to my room.'</p> <p>And so I did. But not for long; the night before things had happened. In the hallway Mrs. Carter had come over. She was wearing a very plain t-shirt and short skirt. It took my breath away. The skirt ended just below her knee but it was pulled up very slightly by a belt that had been fastened to the belt. As her legs parted I could clearly see that she was wearing a pair of panties, the lacy-line of which was visible. The skirt was quite short and barely covered her knees and the upper part of her legs was bare apart from the panties.</p> <p>I tried to pull out the lump that was in my throat as I took in this. It was growing larger and the fabric was stretched tightly around her legs, even as the skirt seemed to ride up her thigh.</p> <p>She looked at that very obvious bulge in my trousers and said:</p> <p>'Would you like to rub one out for me?'</p> <p>It seemed too much for my throat to take so that I said:</p> <p>'Sure, what do you say.'</p> <p>'I suppose I could give you a hand but we haven't finished this round yet.' She said as she leaned further over me onto her side of the sofa.</p> <p>The idea of what was to come was too much, I put both hands on the seat and reached out to stroke her legs just above the knee. She had a leg stretched to the side and a knee was up so that I started to gently rub her. I put my fingers into the hem of my shirt and ran my fingertips up and down her bare, taut thigh.</p> <p>'It's beautiful.' She said in a little voice that suggested she was not in a dream.</p> <p>'It's wonderful to touch.' I found out.</p> <p>She leaned her head back and closed her eyes again while she ran her hand down over the material covering my erection.</p> <p>She said:</p> <p>'I think we should get that off before we go any farther.'</p> <p>'Are you sure?'</p> <p>'Yes, I'm sure. I'm also sure that you're still very hard.'</p> <p>'No, that's not true. I'm really excited.'</p> <p>I reached up with a single finger and touched the tip of my hardness.</p> <p>'I'm sorry. It's just that we're not supposed to be intimate in our house. Would you mind if I took my panties off?'</p> <p>'Of course not, do you mind?' I had to look at her face to tell if she meant it.</p> <p>'I don't mind. In fact it would be quite erotic watching you undress me, would you like to see me without?'</p> <p>I nodded my head in reply to that as she unfastened her skirt and let it fall to the floor. I could now look at her completely unclothed. She had on a lacy-black bra and a lace-edged bra that I couldn't believe that was there on her. But what an incredible sight it was.</p> <p>'Would you like to take your knickers off before taking off yours?' she said.</p> <p>I nodded again and watched her pull the lacy straps of her bra and lay them casually over the seat and then pull her bra downwards to take it into her breasts.</p> <p>As she dropped the bra to the floor her hand went under her skirt to fondle her clitoris and herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
