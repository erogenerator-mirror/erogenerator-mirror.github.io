For as long as he'd been trying to figure out how to get the idea out of her mind, the memory of his cock would keep coming back and being painfully painfully painful. Every time he moved forward and felt like he might rip himself, he'd come back to the sensation of feeling himself, and the pain would have to be replaced by the pleasure. He'd had his fun, so to speak, at this point.</p> <p>"Do you want to know the rest?" He asked, looking down at her with a smirk. She nodded. "Then ask properly."</p> <p>"Is it as big as your Daddy's?" He asked.</p> <p>"It's bigger than I thought," she lied. "And it's not like I can do it for all the time we have together." She lied again, as if to get him to understand what she actually meant when she said 'we' together, but it didn't work out the way she thought it would.</p> <p>"That's because you don't have a dick," he said. "Even when you're so small and pathetic, I like how your cock is bigger than that."</p> <p>"It's small," she said, and a smile lit up the room.</p> <p>"Then why is it so small?"</p> <p>"Because it's all just so small," she whispered, before lifting her voice. "And when I play with it, I find that it gets harder."</p> <p>"I like that," he said, letting a hand creep toward her. "I like how you're getting harder and harder by the second."</p> <p>"And just what are you getting harder of, too?"</p> <p>He grabbed her head in both hands and lifted it to his face. "You were only saying that to tease me," he murmured, and let that drop to just a few inches away. "I couldn't help thinking how nice you are."</p> <p>"What do you mean?" She demanded, but the smile was on her lips again, or at least part of it so she could keep it from showing.</p> <p>"You're not really very good?"</p> <p>"I'm not very good," she said, and he didn't respond.</p> <p>"And if you were? I'd guess that you just don't get much done here in your bedroom," he said, and she couldn't have turned away if she'd had any other questions...</p> <p>"But I got nothing," she said finally, after a long hesitation. She smiled, and her breasts had the same smile of a girl who just got hers and had an embarrassing, if brief reminder that she had been groped by the entire time she was a boy. "It's just that."</p> <p>"There are some things in your life that might be useful," he said, and his finger slid down to her tummy. Just for a moment, and she realized that it was one of the things that he'd used to tease her throughout the night, and that it had done a good job of putting her on the defensive. He had been doing it a few more times before he finally lost patience and began to stroke her skin in a very subtle way.</p> <p>She'd been right on the edge of tears at the thought of someone touching her here in the house, and the thought of him finding his way to her was all it would bear for awhile. What had started out as a harmless game, however, had turned into an intensely erotic and very arousing experience.</p> <p>"Well," she said, and suddenly, it was a little easier to breathe again. "That's just like my dream." She said to him. "It's just...well...I think I might have to sleep with you again."</p> <p>"Are you suggesting what I think you're suggesting?" he snapped. "Of course not. I could have made a point of it right away. You can keep your options open, and I mean that. But there's a difference."</p> <p>"Oh, no, honey." She said. "The point is, if you're so inclined, then I need you to be the one who decides which of my wishes you wish to hear."</p> <p>"Right. So, if I can't agree with your wish then there's just one other thing," he said, and he stood and walked toward her, never taking his eyes off of her.</p> <p>"Oh, stop," she said, even though she felt her heart beating fast. He leaned in and pressed his lips against hers.</p> <p>"What is—"</p> <p>"The wish," she replied, and his lips pushed against hers. He kissed her softly at first, with more passion and more desire than she had imagined, but slowly, steadily, as she began to understand the sensations.</p> <p>He took his lips away as she felt her body trembling.</p> <p>"We really shouldn't be doing—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
