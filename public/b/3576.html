He pulled his cock free from my cunt and stroked it gently.</p> <p>He held his cock up for me to inspect. "You were really good, Miss."</p> <p>"Thank you, Sir. That was better than I could have imagined."</p> <p>Sir nodded his approval. Then, with my knees apart, he spread my cheeks and dipped his penis into my anus. It quickly filled me. I was stretched around it. It felt like he had stretched me so wide. But he pulled his shaft free and held it at the entrance to my bum and pushed it in, slowly inch by inch. The sphincter gave way as I accepted this invader.</p> <p>Sir withdrew the cock just short of my sphincter before reentering me. Again I felt him take me fully but this time he had less control of the entry until he was balls deep. He held me completely still for a moment and thrust into me again. I felt his balls hit my ass and it felt like his balls were in both holes at once.</p> <p>He held still for a moment, savouring the thought of his cock inside me, knowing he could not get it out of my body until the next day. He withdrew almost all the way, then thrust his penis back in again. I felt his balls against my butt. He felt so strong, so solid and I was sure his whole body was hard. He fucked me in this fashion for a good few minutes, then suddenly he withdrew fully.</p> <p>"No!" I suddenly cried out. "Not yet." I jumped off my chair and ran to my dressing table. I took a couple of tissues from the dispenser and wiped the wetness on my bottom. Then I stood in front of him and took each of his balls in my mouth as he had done to me. He moaned as I licked him. I knew I couldn't hold off another minute of orgasm without having another orgasm too.</p> <p>Finally, I sat as he sat down on the bench with a hard cock in his hand. "I'm going to let you have an orgasm," I told him.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, Sir," I admitted and looked at the clock. "I'll be in the bathroom, Sir."</p> <p>I walked out of the toilets and into his arms. He pulled me down onto his lap at once, with him on top of me. We kissed passionately and he gently caressed my breasts as he began once more to slide in and out of me, using the toilet seat for leverage now. We kissed for a while, then he rolled me over on to my back and began to suck my clitoris and the lips around it. Each time his mouth and tongue caused me one orgasm after the other. I came once. When it was over my body shuddered in a long orgasm.</p> <p>Eventually we had to break apart. Sir and I had exchanged phone numbers and he wanted to send me roses. I thought I might never see him again after this experience.</p> <p>The next morning I opened my eyes and saw a new day. I had finally decided to stop looking at the clock and look at the face of the man I had known. I tried to make love with my fingers but each time I wanted to make love I kept going to the toilet and looked. The time passed and the clock finally clicked over.</p> <p>A day passed and I couldn't believe the time. It was just after 2PM and the house felt deserted. I went down the stairs slowly. I felt so alone. I looked back to the toilet and knew it was gone. Then I went further and walked into the bedroom. I was still naked. But there was no sign of the door. I turned and headed back downstairs. I looked at the clock and there was still no indication of time. Perhaps he had come home early.</p> <p>I lay beside him again, still naked. He put his arm around me and rolled me over, kissing me passionately. "I want to make love to you," he told me.</p> <p>"I want to do more than make love," I replied.</p> <p>"What do you want me to do?"</p> <p>"I want you to kiss my breasts," I replied in a husky, sexy voice.</p> <p>"Yes, Sir," he said. He stood up and went to the toilet and took a shower. He got out of the shower and had a bathrobes in the bedroom. I couldn't believe he was taking his time.</p> <p>When he came back in, he held in a box as if waiting for me. He said he was going through this for him. He wasn't looking for me. He wanted me to join him on the bed and kiss the top part ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
