I could tell that she wasn't all that happy with being naked underneath my covers but she soon got used to it and rolled over on top of me. A few moments later I was inside her and I had to take my eyes off of her for a while as the sex in the room was so much more intense. But it was still a good feel. It didn't matter how big or small of a man or woman were. I was still so tight it wouldn't have mattered much, there was nothing to stop the inevitable. But with her so close to climaxing and being naked I just couldn't hold back any longer. Luckily our hands were all over each other and we soon came together, moaning and writhing.</p> <p>Afterwards, I rolled off her and she sat up and looked at me. "God. That was incredible." She leaned over and kissed me and gave me a big hug which I returned. Our bodies pressed against each others and all I could do was stare at her as she ran her fingers across my chest, kissing my face and neck. "You should have come by."</p> <p>"I just wanted to thank you." She smiled at me, her words barely audible.</p> <p>"For what?"</p> <p>She smiled again and said, "You just made me feel so good and so wonderful and I don't know how to thank you for that."</p> <p>I looked at her, not answering her. She lay back down and I knelt there next to her and began to caress her breasts and abdomen. She ran her fingers lightly through my hair. Our tongues and lips met in a long, slow tender embrace and soon, we fell asleep again. My cock was already hard again but I tried not to. I guess it was just a case of having a normal morning and I was still so sleepy.</p> <p>The next morning I awoke the next day to see her sitting on the edge of the bed staring at me. "Wake up sleepy-head!" she said, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. I tried to turn towards her as I could but she didn't bother with a pillow and grabbed my hand and pulled it up between her legs. "I know you're awake. I've been wanting to do this for a while now and I just can't get enough of doing it to you. You don't mind do you?"</p> <p>"No, thank you." I said.</p> <p>"You're good at that, I wouldn't have missed you for anything otherwise." She sighed and reached down and rubbed me a bit. I think she really believed that I was asleep and that I wasn't going to answer her question about why I was naked beneath the covers. I was still trying to get my head around her doing it.</p> <p>With that, she climbed onto the bed and straddled my hips. Her pussy felt so warm and wet and just a bit wetter than it had been. "Lay down," she said and she sat up. I lay there thinking about last night and trying to gather my thoughts. I couldn't begin to remember anything more than this and how beautiful she looked and felt. I wanted to kiss her, to slide my hands down her body and rub and stroke her until she was again ready to be fucked. But I couldn't. I wanted her to fuck me. I remembered the first time we made love and how great it felt, we didn't have to feel so passionate for each other, but the same thing happened with her. Maybe if we had made love on a regular basis, I could have come over to the apartment and talked to her before making love. But as I had done, every time I thought of being in with her, my cock started to stiffen. I know she liked me to talk dirty even if I had to call it a "fucking" because it was one of the words she had used at a certain point, but talking had always turned her on. She knew what we were doing but she also knew what I would do when we got to "practical" and so there was no need to rush things. I just wanted to be with her.</p> <p>I looked at her in her mirror and decided that she couldn't have gotten me to do anything else, I just wanted to be with her. It didn't matter, I wanted her to fuck me just as much as I was. I couldn't deny her. I wanted to be with her. I want to fuck her like I never had before. I want to fuck her like I had never been before. I just couldn't. But there was nowhere else to be.</p> <p>But it wasn't what she said she wanted or needed. She just wanted me to make love to her. She couldn't wait to have me inside of her again. It was time that we did the first partâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
