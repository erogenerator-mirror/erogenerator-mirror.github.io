He'll give me what I want."</p> <p>With the same look in her eyes I knew I knew what she wanted. She had been watching me with my cock in her mouth for weeks now. She knew the way and I knew it. We both knew. I wondered why the fuck I was doing what I was doing. We had so much in common in a country that we knew very little about. She wanted something new. That's why it never seemed strange that her father was not doing some kind of business with the two of us. Maybe I wasn't doing all that much for her. Maybe she wanted a new boyfriend that wouldn't be a burden. Maybe the three of us would get to like one another a lot.</p> <p>"I hope he doesn't want me after he finishes blowing me," she said after a short pause.</p> <p>"I don't care."</p> <p>I walked over and got on my knees between her parted legs. I looked at her dripping pussy for a moment while I held the base of my cock for her as I kissed it lightly. I moved forward and let the head slide into her. I kept the base of the shaft pressed between her lips so everything would open for the head. I slid fully into her and as deep as I could go.</p> <p>"Ohhhhh God," she whispered, "That's big."</p> <p>I felt her opening slowly, but she pushed back and tried to meet with me. I watched the muscles in her arms and body tense slowly. I looked up at her face as she looked down at me. She looked into my eyes, which was wet with tears.</p> <p>"Your cock feels good inside me. It's so thick."</p> <p>"It isn't very long, you're so damn sexy."</p> <p>"Don't worry," she replied, "I haven't had it in me yet. I haven't been with a man for more than a month. It feels so good."</p> <p>"Then it will go in."</p> <p>"Ohhhh God, don't think about going slow," she said, still trying to meet my thrusting with one of her own. "I don't care. It feels so good. Now fuck me."</p> <p>I didn't think it was possible to go slow with her. This was it with all the pent-up desire. I had waited so long for the perfect moment. Now I felt like I could come with one long thrust.</p> <p>"Oh baby, you're so hot too," I said almost panting. "I love fucking you."</p> <p>I leaned in and kissed her softly on the lips as I rocked in and out, watching the expressions of pleasure, as we both found a rhythm. I pushed in deeper and deeper, not moving until she was in the midst of another orgasm. She didn't move; she just held on.</p> <p>"I love your big cock," she said while she kissed me. "I love fucking you."</p> <p>"And I love your big tits," I added.</p> <p>"And I love your big cock."</p> <p>I felt my balls tighten. I felt my balls tighten.</p> <p>No one had ever spoken to me like this. Maybe it was what I wanted. Maybe it wasn't what I wanted but maybe I was just doing it to be with her. Maybe I was a one man man man when I got a chance. What I felt was something that I never would have believed existed.</p> <p>"Oh god, I'm coming," I panted. "And I'm coming," as I kept coming after a short period.</p> <p>"Ohhhh," she replied.</p> <p>There is something exciting about having a cock inside you that feels good, especially when you just came like that. I love the feel of the skin of your cock against mine as it jerked inside you. When it jerked you have the urge to pull it all the way out and go slow. I watched her face; it was as if she were experiencing a sexual experience that would never be repeated. I looked around her room with a new confidence. I saw in the wall with the door locked that she was not in the room of a one man man. She had been used tonight. Her bedroom door was wide open.</p> <p>I leaned in and kissed her hard, not wanting to hurt her.</p> <p>"Didn't you come?"</p> <p>"Yes, very much. I didn't think I would ever be able to cum again without you."</p> <p>"That is just what I wanted."</p> <p>"I'm right in there," I said as slowly pulled my softening cock out of her body.</p> <p>"That's it. Go slow," she moanedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
