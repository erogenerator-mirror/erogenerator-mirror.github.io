She leaned in to kiss his lips before she pulled back. Her face glowed at the thought, and she couldn't believe how much she was already in love with Todd.</p> <p>"I've never felt this way about anyone before, not until we started having sex with you," she said, running her fingers through her husband's short, brown hair. He sighed.</p> <p>"Me either. I'm never gonna see you as a guy, unless we meet some hot girl out there, and she wants to be with me. Maybe that'll change later, just to try and get you laid."</p> <p>"We should take care of that," she said, moving her mouth down off of Todd's kiss, and taking his shaft in her hands. He sighed before leaning down to kiss her again.</p> <p>Sucking gently, he slipped the head of his dick into her mouth.</p> <p>"I thought we should do this in bed."</p> <p>She laughed. "It might be nice with you on top."</p> <p>Grabbing her by the thighs, he pulled her over on top of him, spreading her legs apart as she straddled him, and lined the head of his dick with her pussy.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" she asked with a laugh.</p> <p>"Ready?" he asked.</p> <p>"Uh-huh," she replied. Slowly, she lowered her body down on him, taking his dick all the way in before she was sitting fully on him again, his dick resting against her cervix. She slowly rocked her hips, sliding her pussy over his shaft as her orgasm continued to build.</p> <p>"I love you," she said, leaning up to kiss him.</p> <p>Tired from their lovemaking, they fell asleep in each other's arms, a small puddle of sweat forming between their two bodies as they sleptâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
