But it happened. It was easy to tell. No one else knew. It happened, and I was not hurt badly. The fact was that I loved it. It was not only the excitement of being made to submit, which brought me pleasure, I was also the excitement of being made to give, or receive. I loved the thrill of being made to submit. I loved being forced, or being fucked. I loved being teased. I loved being punished. I was the one who had been made to submit. I loved being used. I loved being told what to do.</p> <p>After a while, I noticed that her hips were starting to move under her. She was getting more and more excited. She wanted to make me want to do something so she could make me do it.</p> <p>"Oh, please," she said, "do it. I need it."</p> <p>I was going to do it, I would do whatever she asked. I would please her. But we needed time, I needed to be ready, if she wanted things to be really frantic.</p> <p>The idea that she would want to play with me again, and to use me made me go faster and harder. I got up on my knees and held her hips with my arms and started to fuck her. I fucked her with hard strokes, which made her come again, and a squeal. She held my hips and rubbed her own clit. She was very wet. I could feel everything.</p> <p>She asked me to come as well. I didn't mind. It felt great. I told her she could let me. She said she wanted to, and I could.</p> <p>I could really feel my orgasm. My muscles tightened inside and I felt all my muscles contract hard. I could see her face and hear it, it had a look of relief.</p> <p>She told me not to slow down. She wanted me to come.</p> <p>I was in heaven. I wasn't going to stop going. I did not. I was close. But she stopped.</p> <p>She said it was okay for me to finish. Maybe a bit slower, but we had all our own time.</p> <p>I kept going and came in her as hard as I could.</p> <p>She said she felt better when I did it. I had not come that hard in my life.</p> <p>"Thank you," I said.</p> <p>I wanted to take her. "But I still have a lot left left," she said.</p> <p>I kissed her and said "I need us to talk today."</p> <p>I went home.</p> <p>I had not seen her at work.</p> <p>We had been together for a while. She made me feel really young and sexy, she treated me well, and we made each other feel good. And the first time we had sex was nice. As we started to get into it we started having sex. I really liked it.</p> <p>It was fun. Sex was the way things would always be. We never wanted it to be. We liked to be together. We liked to be with each other. We had not always enjoyed each other. Our relationship had always been fun, but we had not always done it. And we were still having fun. We have never felt like that before. We would never be happy for each other.</p> <p>We had tried to do everything differently. I had tried to go faster, but we had never been able to. I had always had to control myself, but we had always enjoyed it to have sex. For both of us. We tried to find an outlet for sex. We learned how to make each other happy, but we had never been able to do that.</p> <p>We still found time to try. We knew how to make each other happy. But we knew how to let someone else do that. We just knew what it was to be with someone else. It was fun.</p> <p>We have never had sex as much as we just had. It was fun. But I never realized how much I loved this. It was so satisfying. It was a whole new level of excitement for me.</p> <p>When he was gone, I was feeling more than happy.</p> <p>Well, that is one of the things that was really fun for me, and I had to know how to get it back. Or to be different. We just didn't know how to go that far with him when we were together, yet we could always remember our time together in the morning.</p> <p>So we still had lots to doâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
