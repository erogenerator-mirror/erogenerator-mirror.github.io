Just as I had with her, the only thing that keeps you sane is your heart and soul and you just don't want to let anyone else out. Well, no-one except the person who helped get our story out. But, the fact remains, this kind of thing happens most every couple of months or so and there's more than that going on and we haven't discussed it. We'll keep going, so don't worry. What we're going to do is continue to talk about this, the whole point."</p> <p>She stopped breathing and he looked at her like she was nuts. "So much, so soon?" he asked again, "You think I'm finally going to have my chance to say 'no' yet?"</p> <p>"Just don't say 'no' to me, you idiot! I want the truth." She smiled softly and she moved down his body to kiss his lips deeply, then moving to his neck and ears, she leaned over and kissed him deeply and ran her tongue over his nipple. The man was so hard as she continued to tease his nipple over and over with her mouth, she licked, sucking, biting, and nipping as she slowly moved down his body and she kissed and sucked his cock into her mouth as she moved back up to suck him.</p> <p>He threw back his head and groaned deeply. "Fuck, you're driving me crazy!" she groaned, then kissed his balls and kissed his tight ass. He looked at her with wonder in his eyes and asked, "What do you mean, 'the truth'?"</p> <p>"Well," she answered, "the truth is that I've been so fucking horny for some time now. You'd better leave before I get you off." She looked at him and smiled. She pulled her bikini bottoms off and then sat up and said, "Just don't tell anybody at my party, will you?"</p> <p>"I won't tell anyone," he said, not wanting to lose her. "But, you have to promise, it's a date."</p> <p>"Oh, so now you think I haven't told everyone! Well it's not going to be a date, it'll be more of a dinner and then maybe a movie or movie for fun. Just promise me that you will keep that in mind after dinner."</p> <p>"I'll promise." They kissed, she took his hand with her, and they walked to the other side of the pool, hand in hand and then into the cabana. As they walked, they talked, he told her that he loved how her ass moved as it moved under the water. He kissed her again and she pulled him close and she kissed him deeply and said, "I love you," while running her fingernail up and down his cheek.</p> <p>"I love you, too, my dear, but I have to run," he said and they both laughed as she led him back into the other side of their pool. When they got there, she looked at the three of them and said, "You're going to have to leave your parents for later."</p> <p>"What's wrong?" he asked with concern, "What's the matter?"</p> <p>"They're going to be gone for two months." She looked at him with her beautiful teeth and said, "And, to be sure you have no idea where we are going to be for that time, you're going to have to wait until the week after your parents are gone. So," she added, "let's go grab something to wear tomorrow. I want to go shopping tonight."</p> <p>"You're going to wear it for me?" he asked with trepidation.</p> <p>"I certainly am going to!" she responded with an indubitable smile as she got out of the pool and headed over to the door, "I was hoping you'd wear some of this little outfit." She smiled as she reached into her beach bag. She retrieved a bathing suit that had come from the closet, some very skimpy bikini bottoms that were barely covering her crotch, a t-shirt with a very low neckline and a sheer, long sleeve sweater that came down to mid-thigh. She also retrieved a pair of very skimpy, nearly see-through, red, thongs.</p> <p>"Damn!" he exclaimed, "You're going to get some strange looks from some people!"</p> <p>"Only the guys will notice," she giggled, "I'll go and put them at ease before we finish this trip." She returned to the water, took his hand, and they walked toward the door.</p> <p>"How does it feel?" she asked him, "It feels good, does it?"</p> <p>"Hell, it feels greatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
