The voice was sweet and innocent, and I could tell that she had already known the answer to that question.</p> <p>"I'm going to tell you everything. Do you still want the answers?"</p> <p>"Sure baby. What are you going to do, if I don't like." She sounded as eager as I felt.</p> <p>"We can do this, if you want, before I decide."</p> <p>"Ok, what are we going to do?" she said, not breaking away from me but staring at my fingers and my hard cock. "Ok, I'm going to tell you everything, ok?" I could tell that she was worried because her voice was getting softer.</p> <p>"Ok," I answered again, a little harder. "Here's the deal. I'm going to tell you everything. It's going to happen quickly." Then I grabbed hold of her hand and started to get into the car.</p> <p>I sat next to her and pulled her face down into my lap. "Ok honey, this is going to be a surprise," I said in a matter of fact tone that was both playful and deadly serious. "If the story doesn't surprise you, you're on your own. However, if it doesn't surprise you, maybe you won't be scared enough to stop me from telling it all. So what were you gonna do?" I was feeling playful and a little dangerous. That wasn't what I wanted, I wanted to do something that would hurt her, but something I knew that she might not be happy about it. I didn't want to hurt her just like I wanted to hurt her in a way that a man can hurt a woman. I wanted to hurt her in such a way that she would let all her anger and fear leave her body in my hands.</p> <p>She looked into my eyes and nodded her head in a "Yes." It was that look I loved, and in a way that even I wouldn't have thought possible, it turned me on to an extent that made my arousal even stronger. "Good," I whispered to her, "I promise it won't hurt you. That's the whole idea. I promise. Ok?"</p> <p>"Oh.. yes... yes, baby. I promise no one will ever know. I love you with all my heart," she said, then leaned forward.</p> <p>I held her face in my hands and pushed myself upward.</p> <p>"I love you." she said, and her voice sounded much deeper than it was.</p> <p>"Just hold on. I want you to relax and breathe normally, ok?" I asked. She nodded in me, and I smiled. I let her breathe in as she continued to look at the floor, and she was a little winded. There was nothing sexual about what we were doing. We sat there for a while, and I stroked her hair softly so she wouldn't think it was a big deal. Then I ran my hand along her shoulders and down to her breasts, which she had taken into her hand. I could tell by how she was squirming that she was getting turned on, and I knew that she could get her body into the whole thing. This was a moment that few people could be proud to have. I knew that she would like to hear it.</p> <p>Soon, however, I pulled away to get a better look at her. I couldn't believe how sexy she was. She kept looking up at me and her breathing was getting heavier, a look of confusion on her face. She had her eyes closed as if she was in deep, hypnotic, orgasmic bliss.</p> <p>"I love you," I said softly to her. I could feel her body shivering and shaking with each breath and the look on her face, and I knew she had been waiting for this moment for a long time by now.</p> <p>"I love you too." and she was now staring at me with a look of sheer ecstasy on her face. I didn't know what to do, but I pulled her back into my arms, and she put her head on my shoulder. I could feel her fingers digging into my side as she tried to push me down. I held her as she went, and then gave her a kiss that almost made my heart melt. Her lips on mine felt warm and inviting. I broke the kiss and took her hand away. I then led her to the front of the limo and sat down and took her in my arms. I could see how red her face was; she could not have known that her heart would just break at that moment.</p> <p>I pulled my lips away from hers and held her in one hand and her chin in the other. Slowly I turned her and kissed her, a gentle kiss that she was responding to like an animal. We had always been gentle and caring with eachâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
