He turned off the music as she followed him out and into the dark bedroom.</p> <p>"Take off your dress ... and your heels."</p> <p>"Yes Master."</p> <p>She stood in front of him naked. She could feel the juices flowing from her pussy. If she bent over and turned the light on he knew it would be dark. He walked towards her with his hand on her shoulder, his cock almost touching her face.</p> <p>"Stroke your cunt and let me see you touch it." That only brought her back to herself as she began to knell over his cock. God it felt good to stroke and kiss it. She reached out and pulled down the zipper to her panties making sure those dainty panties remained pushed over her pussy. She reached up behind her neck and undid the button on her sweater. It fell to the floor and she slid the long dress over her head and stood with her hands on her thighs. She saw him looking down at her as she bent her breasts forward and her nipples were now rock hard and begging.</p> <p>He put his hands on her knees and pulled them apart. He saw her lips open and her eyes get big as she felt the tip of his cock at the opening of her cunt.</p> <p>"Put it in."</p> <p>The command seemed to snap her out of the daydream. "Please, Master..."</p> <p>He pushed into her slowly, as if to take his time. She felt the stretching in her cunt and knew it would only hurt for a bit. He reached around to her breasts and roughly pinched her nipples. Her eyes closed again and she held her breath as he slowly began moving inside of her.</p> <p>"I've fucked a few girls for you now. I can not make what you can't handle, so you will just have to let me do things to you until you have what I have been wanting." His cock sank into her as far as it could go and she moaned loudly as his hands left her nipples and went to her thighs. She felt him start to fuck her harder and faster and reached between them to cup his balls. He was grunting with each thrust now and she knew he was close to coming.</p> <p>"I can come inside you. I've got you and I want it to be as good as I can get it." When she felt him start to shudder she knew he was getting close. He pumped as hard and fast as he could and she heard him groan. She moved her hands to fondle his balls and balls made him shudder again. He pulled out suddenly and slammed back into her making her scream. The sound made her feel as if she had been hit by the most wonderful music and the vibrations were so good.</p> <p>"Good job slut." She felt him explode deep in her cunt and he pulled out to spurt his load all over her. After a few moments he was done and looked down into her eyes. "Clean me off and I want to hear from you, if I get back." She felt his tongue at the opening of her mouth and could taste the faint trace of his semen.</p> <p>"Thank you, Master."</p> <p>"Let me just take off these panties and come back in the morning. Do you have any instructions for your next day with meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
