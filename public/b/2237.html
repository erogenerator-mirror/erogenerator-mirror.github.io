I opened up and felt myself getting moist inside. My breathing became shallow as she moved to lie beside me. I pulled my legs apart, letting her know I was ready and she could go as she wanted. She kissed my wet center, and ran a finger along it. We laid there for a few moments, enjoying the experience, before she turned me on my back. She moved a little to her knees to do the same, leaving me wanting more. She moved up and straddled me, sitting right above me. I reached out and stroked her breasts, then leaned forward and licked my juices from between her pussy lips.</p> <p>She rubbed herself against my face, and then moved her body down over me again. I teased her clit, which had a life of its own while she stroked me. She moved harder than ever and her back arched. She had never climaxed like this before, or if she didn't already had. She slowed to almost imperceptible as she felt herself going over the edge. She slid up so her pussy was in the air, and began moving against me. Our bodies slapped together hard against each other, the feeling sent us both over the edge. She fell forward with me lying on the bed as her hands sought to bring us both pleasure. She squeezed me and I ran my hands up her back and over her nipples to her neck. "God, I came again," she whispered.</p> <p>She rolled off me and sat up to hug me. I lifted up and pulled her toward me. We kissed while our hands played with each other's bodies. I pulled her bra off as she moved one hand down to caress me. My lips moved lower, and her breasts were bare before my hands roamed over them. I had never touched any of them naked before, but I loved her bare flesh. Her nipples stiffened out into my hands as I kissed and licked them. I pulled her back against me and ran my fingers along her belly as she ground against my cock. She moved closer and slipped one hand between us. She began stroking me as she did to her own breasts, and we both closed our eyes. We were so connected, and if it wasn't for the blindfold, we couldn't have stopped it. I felt her fingers stroking my dick again as she rubbed her clit, and then I felt myself cumming. She rubbed her clit against my hand to bring me back, and I felt her body tighten in climax again as she came. We kissed as our fingers explored a new place, moving from where we had been before and moving again. When she slid off of me, I saw I had the blindfold on. I pulled it back up and untied it with a flourish. I put her back on the bed and she spread her legs. I felt the wetness of her lips as I lowered myself between them. As I kissed her, I felt my tongue probing her body, moving all around in the wetness of her. I moved farther down, as I felt her hands on my dick; I could feel her wet lips moving across the head, making a slippery pass with each pass. I lifted my head, and pushed my dick down to her entrance, finding the opening. I felt her pull her lips aside just before I entered her. Her body pressed back as I entered her for the first time since we started. Both of us groaned a little breathlessly as I pushed deep inside her. I moved my hips to begin fucking her slowly, but I wanted more. I placed my hands on her breasts and felt they were very large. "Suck them, and don't stop," I requested.</p> <p>She pulled up and pulled me close, as she took the right nipple into her mouth, and sucked it.</p> <p>"I want you to do this," I said, as she stroked my dick.</p> <p>She kissed me again, and lifted to sit on my lap. I felt her pussy sliding back against my rock-hard dick. She leaned forward and rested her arms on my shoulders, as I kissed her. I felt her body arch as my cock began to pound her. As I continued to drive into her, she held herself against me with her arms and knees. I felt her hands move down to grab my shoulders as I fucked her harder.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum again," I warned her, though I didn't care. The pleasure I felt was too great and it had just the right amount of pressure to make her cum. She moaned into my mouth as she began to climax. Her back arched, and I felt her body tense. She pressed hard against me, and held onto me tightly. I kissed her lips, and felt myself shooting inside her again. She held me as her climax went on and on; eventually I dropped my head on her shoulder, and I felt her soft bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
