The entire time I was going through the clothes and the makeup pile, I kept getting interrupted by the looks from the other girls, who looked at the bulge in my khakis. I didn't care. So, all the way back to my cabin, I couldn't help asking, "Shall we?"</p> <p>"Not yet," said Amy, taking my hand and pulling me towards her. "Do you have to use the bathroom before we go home?"</p> <p>She was right. I was still feeling a little dizzy from having had so many drinks. I led her to her room. I put on a bathrobe, and we undressed. She laid down on the bed, and pulled the covers up over her. She turned out the light and smiled, saying that she was tired. I started up the bathroom and she started to get out of bed, but I stopped. "Shit" I said. "You're gonna get me in trouble." She smiled. I stepped in and got in the tub. Her body felt amazing as I turned on the water. When I got her in the tub, she turned over and started to stroke my dick. It was getting hard and she started to suck it. I could hear the raspy sound of her throat as she took me all the way in. She had both hands around the base of my prick and she was slowly trying to move my head in and out of her mouth. I let her slide me out of her mouth.</p> <p>"Oh, you're so big" she said, and then went back to sucking. One of her hands moved up under the water. "I have a lot more to learn." She took me back in her mouth and started to move a finger up and down my shaft. I was getting close. She looked up, smiled, and said to me "Come close to me. I want to give you a blow job on our bed, like you did on the boat."</p> <p>I stepped back in the tub with her. She looked up and smiled and I got right in her face with my whole dick in her mouth. Her eyes bulged and she stopped sucking on me immediately. I had to move in between her legs, so I took off my robe and climbed onto the bed. I placed my dick in her and she opened her mouth and started to stroke me. As I started to fuck her mouth, she opened her eyes and smiled, licking her lips. Then she put her lips on mine and I entered her mouth. There was so much lubrication on me, it felt like a rubber glove. I was now about half the length of the tub, so it wasn't hard to stroke. She put her feet on my ass and pushed back against me and started to moan. I couldn't tell if she was going to cum or just letting me have my fun. If she was going to suck me off, I wanted her to have full experience with something like that.</p> <p>It never really mattered to me what she had with me. I knew that she wanted sex, and I wanted it. So, I was going to get that. I fucked her mouth with vigor. In that position, I could thrust into her, and she couldn't get enough of my dick, in and out of her mouth. She had it all worked out. It was the best cock-sucking I had, in my short life. As I picked up a pace, she opened her eyes again. "Mmm...that's good. God that's so hot. You feel so good. Oh, god" She was breathing heavy now. "Mmm I'm gonna cum soon, baby."</p> <p>"Mmm, mmm" I said, starting to speed up. I didn't want to just cum yet; I wanted her to cum with me. This girl had some skills that she kept under wraps. It was more about getting off. She was doing all that work, so I wanted to finish her. So, I gave it to her, and she moaned and shuddered as I pumped that load into her mouth. After a while I got up. The lights were down and it was dark, so we didn't realize the presence of the other guests.</p> <p>"Wow", said Amy. "I guess you're one lucky guy." She kissed me again. She said she liked hearing that.</p> <p>After getting clean, we had a coffee and sat down to start the semester. We were going to study, and be open for more of each others' ideas. I could tell that I was going to get a great teacher.</p> <p>The next day I finished up my final year as a student and started my teaching business. I was so excited. I didn't think that all young men would want to be teaching, but I liked teaching girls. I was lucky.
