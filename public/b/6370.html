I kissed her gently on the lip, tasting her lips for the first time since we began kissing. Her tongue was on my lips, gently tasting and tasting as we kissed. Our mouths pressed together as I began to caress her hair, loving her as I always had so many years ago. My other hand rested on her hip as it lay on my forearm and I began to squeeze. Her head began to lean back under me and I smiled to myself. My lips left hers and moved to her neck, kissing along the way. The feel of her soft skin in my lips caused a shiver to roll down my spine. I felt my cock surge again as I gently sucked on her skin.</p> <p>Kari’s back arched as I kissed my way slowly down to her cleavage. I gently pulled her top up and the top of her shirt came undone so I could suck and tease her nipples with my tongue. I began to rub her breasts, feeling her nipples swell with pleasure. My fingers pulled her shirt up and over her head, exposing the pink lacey bra she was wearing and the smoothness of her skin against my fingers. The bra straps rested on her shoulders and her pale skin looked like a shimmering bronze in the sunlight. I kissed my way down to her belly button as my hand found its way across her ribs. My hands lifted the shirt up and over her breasts as I kissed them softly.</p> <p>"Mhmm..." I mumbled, a little surprised to have had two of my nipples be so hard and sensitive. I rolled her breasts into my hands and squeezed them before licking their flesh. Kari’s back arched again, and her breathing quickened to a more ragged tone. I licked over the top of one of her breasts and lightly flicked the nipple with my tongue. I lowered my head and gently sucked on the nipple, loving it in my mouth. It was soft and sweet to the taste, but not as smooth as it had that day at school. I could feel her body tighten just a little bit when she moaned softly. I pulled back and licked at her neck again, a little more tender and knowing how sensitive it was. I slowly licked down to her navel and then back up to her lips, licking underneath her ear.</p> <p>"Mhuhhh?" she moaned, her voice hoarse. "What are you doing?" I asked playfully. I didn't know where the teasing had come from, but it didn't matter. One of my hands reached between us and she felt the hardness of my cock, pressing against her.</p> <p>"I...I..." she sputtered quietly. "I have to make you cum...and if you don't, I will..." her voice trailed off. Oh, yes....I thought to myself. This was about my pleasure...and hers. I felt a little better just with the idea of her wanting more.</p> <p>My tongue went between her legs and slowly, teasingly I licked up the length of her slit. I ran my tongue up and down her slit, tasting how sweet she was. I could taste her salty, sweat, juices and it was intoxicating. I slowly kissed the outside of her lips and then pushed my tongue hard against her in a slow motion. I could feel the walls of her pussy stretch as my tongue pushed inside it and then pulled back to the tip. I began to explore the lips of her body with my tongue, loving the feel of her body under my fingers. I wanted to taste her. I wanted to make my first time with her like nothing else ever could. The feeling of her naked and vulnerable under my touch took me over the edge. I could feel my cock begin to swell, pushing against her hand as my tongue explored deeper inside her. She felt so good, and I was going to make her come. Kari pushed harder against my tongue until I couldn't feel it any longer. "OH FUCK!" she cried out and I let her hips down and sucked on her clit, flicking it with the tip of my tongue. Her hand pushed down on the side of my head, and I felt her fingers begin to press hard against my skull. "Yes." she hissed, pulling my mouth back onto her. She bit my shoulder hard enough to get it and then moaned wordlessly. She was coming, she was coming while the room around us was dimming. I ran my tongue over her mouth and heard her breath catch as she moaned my name. "My God," she whispered hoarsely. I felt her body jerk slightly as her breathing slowed, and then I felt her warm soft arms around me, holding me against her body as she came. Her hand pushed my head harder against her pussy and I could feel the muscles of her pussy contracting and relaxing in rhythm with her coming.
