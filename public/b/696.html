I start to pull away, but she grabs me and pulls me in, kissing me fiercely. Her tongue darts between my lips and enters my mouth as if it's seeking to enter the very depths of my soul. I can feel her hips rubbing up and down the length of my cock at a delicious pace, causing it to pulse in appreciation of her body.</p> <p>"What would you like me to do?" She whispers against my mouth as her hand slips up and down the length of my shaft, making small circles.</p> <p>"Whatever you like," I murmur up at her, as her hand continues to play with my cock.</p> <p>I wrap my arm around her back and pull her closer to me to me, holding her tight to me as I push my manhood deep within her. The feel of her hot skin against mine, the feel of her mouth on mine and the feel of our bodies pushing together has me close to the brink, and I know that I can go no further, this moment is just beginning.</p> <p>Our lips never left each other as we kiss, and just as I'm about to kiss her again, she kisses me hard and fast, and I can feel my body tensing, even as I feel the tingle in my balls beginning to pulse within my balls.</p> <p>"I want you," the words tumble from my mouth out of breath as I break the kiss and look up at her, watching her as she slowly releases her lips from mine, a devilish grin spread across her face and a wicked gleam in her eyes.</p> <p>"I want you," she tells me before she starts to run her tongue along the length of my chin, sliding up to my neck.</p> <p>"I want you," she again whispers as her hand flicks the very tip of my chin, drawing a drop of my cum.</p> <p>"I will," she promises me as she licks her fingertip and slowly slides it into my mouth, sliding down the length of my neck making sure she gets every drop.</p> <p>"I'll be right back," she tells me, and we quickly get to our feet. As we head across the room to the next room, I can see that one of the curtains is down. As we enter the room, the lights from the room make it hard for her to read her surroundings, and I find her eyes watching me for a long moment before she smiles at me and heads off to join her friends. "What now?" she asks, her voice husky with desire, "if we're going to spend the night together?"</p> <p>"I'll be right back," I tell her, and she nods and walks through the door. We walk down the hallway once we get to the elevator, and I can feel the heat of her body against mine. We can feel each other's heat and our bodies moving against each other.</p> <p>We get on the elevator again, and step in front of the door. I watch as her eyes devour my form, and I feel her hand reaching out and slipping down my stomach, pulling my pants down a little bit. "Are you ready?" she asks before she pulls my shorts down, and then grabs my rock hard cock in her hand, running her other hand along my shaft.</p> <p>"I have to, but we probably shouldn't do this," I tell her as she wraps her wet fingers around my shaft.</p> <p>"We shouldn't," she tells me before moving to kiss me passionately. I moan as I feel her warmth around me, and before I can push her away from me, she has me pinned against our bodies, kissing me long and hard, my hands resting on her hips.</p> <p>"Let me get undressed," I say into her mouth as she pulls her sweater up, revealing her full round breasts, and I slide her skirt off her hips, revealing her bare sexy legs as I pull her thong down the crack of her ass.</p> <p>"We don't have time," she assures me as she sits down on top of me, her legs wrapping around mine as she presses her mound down on my shaft while our tongues dance wildly, playing around the inside of our mouths with each beat of our kisses.</p> <p>"Yes we do," she promises me, as our bodies press together hard and fast, her breasts rubbing against mine as our mouths continue to thrust into each other. I feel she's pushing her wet cunt all over my shaft at the same time, and then she's sliding back a little farther so that just the head is being penetrated. I gasp, closing my eyes as much as I can before giving her my lips again.</p> <p>"Mmm, I can't do this on my first date," she tells meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
