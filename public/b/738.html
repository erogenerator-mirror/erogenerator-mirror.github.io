He knew what he wanted to do and had planned it all out.</p> <p>"So, you didn't want to let me know what happened, did you?" he asked. She shook her head no. "Well? You can come with me, I know what you're like. I promise it would be worth it."</p> <p>He wasn't sure but she seemed genuinely happy that she got to fuck someone else. She got up and headed to room to change. He watched her ass as she left. He decided not to make it any worse than it was today. She was in a hurry and needed a nap.</p> <p>********************</p> <p>When he got back to the office his wife was sitting at her desk. He said "Here's your work," nodding toward her purse. "You owe me one," and he handed her a twenty. She gave it a few minutes to get it out and opened it again.</p> <p>"This is my twenty. I'll give it back to you at my next meeting. You can pick it up again sometime."</p> <p>"Thanks" she said, took a paper and headed out. He didn't know what to think. She was now totally turned on! God she was hot, he thought. He wondered how she would react when he called her again. She did owe him a blowjob but he wasn't going to make it easy for her. "How about you give it up tonight and I give it to you tomorrow?" he offered. Of course she would want to give him a really good blowjob.</p> <p>He was surprised at her response. It never seemed like she felt that way. Not only did she get turned on, she wanted him to have fun like she did. "I am game if you are."</p> <p>"Good" she replied. "I will get back to you. I'll see you tonight." She left her desk, closed the door and turned off the lights. She was now very wet. She laid there, thinking about it. She was thinking of how much she loved him and how she wanted him to be turned on by her. She had done this many times but it always ended to a good fucking. A little bit of sex never really helped. She would not be able to go again with him.</p> <p>She was thinking about it one more time. She decided that it would be worth it. He might as well get to it too right? She had a plan. She walked to her desk, sat down and started on what she knew would be a great time.</p> <p>Tom walked into the bedroom. "You sure you're not going to let me fuck her?"</p> <p>"No, but it can be a deal breaker." he said. As he walked toward her she took off both of her clothes and laid them on her desk. He put on a condom and pushed his head between her legs. She looked up at him with a huge smile and reached between his legs, took his cock and guided it slowly into her waiting pussy. "Mmmmm, you feel so good this way." She said softly. "Mmmmm, I love your cock." Tom groaned. He slid completely into her, feeling her vaginal muscles wrap around him on every stroke. She groaned softly and moved her hips up and down slightly to make his cock move in and out. She closed his eyes and leaned her head back. "You're so good. Just keep going like that. Don't stop again. Oh, that feels good." He slowed his pace and held him deep as his muscles tightened as if he were trying to push a baseball into a ball, to keep the ball from being crushed. "I think I'm going to cum too again. I know I wouldn't lose it."</p> <p>"Not yet," she said. "Do you mind holding me, or do you want to fuck me?"</p> <p>"Hold me!" with that he moved himself under her and buried his cock as far as it would go. He pulled it out almost all the way and moved up on her, holding it still inside her. He started in again and worked his way through her legs up towards her butt. When he touched her anus, she tensed up and he pulled out, moving on top of her, kissing her neck and moving his hand to her breasts. He cupped them and rubbed her nipples.</p> <p>"What a beautiful sight!" he thought. She had a body that just screamed sex. He had had a look of total passion there in the darkness of her room, and now in what appeared to be a very, very beautiful bedroom. She closed the door again and turned her back to him. He moved in and bent his head down to her breasts. She wrapped her arms around his head, pressing her breasts together so they could all be kissed and sucked. He could feel her nipples harden against him and his erection became as hard as it couldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
