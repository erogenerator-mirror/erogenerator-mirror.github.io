It's just not natural. Besides, I've always wanted him to look at me like that."</p> <p>He smiled. "Well, if that's how you feel too, just keep looking at him, okay?"</p> <p>My response was to give my thighs a couple of jiggles as I turned and leaned over in front of him. I looked him square in the eyes as his hands roamed across my back, shoulders, and up to my breasts. He squeezed softly, and my nipples poked out sharply, as I lifted my chest higher to encourage him. When he finally lifted his hand high enough, he gave my nipple a flick that brought a shiver up my neck, and a gentle tug.</p> <p>"God those titties are so firm, like ripe fruit."</p> <p>"Uh...maybe," I said with another little wiggle of my lips, and he gave my nipple another tug. "Maybe," I replied with a gasp, arching my lower back and pulling the front of my skirt away. My bare pussy tingled as I saw the little pucker of his chin peeking out.</p> <p>He pulled my skirt down and stepped out of it, then pulled me to him, slipping his body up mine and wrapping both arms around me. He pressed his lips to my shoulder and whispered to me, "Honey, you're so damn sexy." He lifted an eye contact with me as he lowered his face to mine and brushed his tongue across my lips, causing my head to jerk up and down as I parted them, welcoming the taste with my tongue and giving him space in front of me. His tongue slipped between my lips and into my mouth, and I pulled my head back, our faces pressing tightly together with his muscular arms around me. We moved my head back and forth, and he slipped his tongue into my mouth before pulling it out and licking the tip. We continued to kiss deeply, and I felt his hand sliding up my back, to cup my ass, which was barely covered by the taffeta of my wrap. I could feel the heat of his growing erection in his pants as he pressed it closer.</p> <p>His tongue slid along my upper lip, and slid in to brush against mine. His fingers slid down to play with my clit, and he rubbed it lightly. I tilted my head to meet his mouth. I kissed him deeply as my hand slid up and down his tuffish covered chest, and felt him press his hips against mine. He brought his lips from mine to my ear, and kissed and nipped at it seductively.</p> <p>"Hmm, let's get a room at my place and you can take me upstairs," he said, "so we can make that very special night. Are you game?"</p> <p>I nodded as his hand left my back and wandered up to my bare breast. His fingers rolled and toyed with my nipple, pinching it lightly before moving to the other. I moaned and leaned back, offering my bare ass to him. He lifted one of my thighs as his hand closed in on my exposed pussy, and rubbed the outside of my slit.</p> <p>"Mmm, you smell good enough to eat," he said after a couple seconds, and I could feel moisture trickling down between my legs.</p> <p>"I told you so," I replied breathlessly in reply. "Did I disappoint?"</p> <p>He nodded again. "You did, so now, let's do something else."</p> <p>He pushed my leg back, making me lie back, then stood up to remove his tights and t-shirt. When he did, he was wearing briefs and a red undershirt with a large bulging heart printed on it. I could see the outline of his rapidly rising erection in the darkness of my room.</p> <p>He sat at the side of the bed beside me, but before he sat down, gave me a big kiss, and rubbed a hand across my stomach. "Honey, I've waited quite a while to make love to you like this."</p> <p>I laughed a little at that, and wrapped an arm loosely around his neck as our tongues danced in each other's mouths. I brought my hand up his belly and rubbed up to his turgid flesh in slow little circles and up between us, before sliding a hand down from his shoulders. I ran my hand over it, and down and up his chest, and then around it to cup his face. I pulled his lips back from mine for a moment, and whispered to him, "I want this to be special, baby. Let me take care of you."</p> <p>His lips were soft and full, with a little kiss of his own. I could feel my mouth watering as I realized exactly what he wanted, and how badly my desire for him was growing. He sat back, smiled wide and said, "Noâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
