He was still holding the robe over her naked body, so he continued fondling. She felt him move down the front of her body, caressing, stroking and licking the entire area with his tongue. He kept a finger in between her legs, pressing the soft lips of her pussy lips, moving it around. He knew that her body did not want to be free of what he was doing to her; it wanted to be totally in his control.</p> <p>She held the robe together with her hands, as he licked up to the very tip of her clit and then back down, kissing it. He made slow circles around her clit with his tongue. When he put his middle finger in her wet pussy, she tensed up and then sighed.</p> <p>“Mm, now I can please you with my tongue more.” Her head was moving in the opposite side of the tub, her hair was hanging over her face making her look even sexier. She was looking a little flushed, as if she was enjoying his attentions, and as her body became more relaxed, she relaxed back down on the tile floor. He still held his robe on.</p> <p>He moved the robe back up in front of her body, showing off her tits, still covered by the robe. A slight grin came across her face. He started kissing the upper part of her tits and then moved back toward her mouth, slowly covering each one with his mouth.</p> <p>She was starting to breath harder, her arms were quivering, she was trying to move her body under him. Her head was moving up and down. His soft lips covered her mouth to let her breathe, and he started to kiss her cheeks, her neck and finally, slowly moving over to her breasts. He still had hold on her nipple, so he took a second to flick it, as she sucked in more air.</p> <p>Her breathing was heavier now. He pulled her breasts toward his face, his hands held them up toward the shower. Her nipples got larger in his hands, and he kissed them. He could still feel the warmth emanating from her body on his lap. Her hips started to move around a little and he put his hand in between her legs. He could tell she was starting to hump again.</p> <p>He put an arm around her, she put her hand on my head to muffle her moans.</p> <p>“Let me get your shower now”, she said as she slowly stood up from his lap</p> <p>He stood, as she dried herself slowly with the towel. He pulled the robe off, he held it as if in surrender for her to use it to get out of the tub.</p> <p>“There we go for the first time!”, she said, as she hugged him, her nipples still rock hard, pushing against the terry cloth shirt.</p> <p>He took her hand and led her out of the shower, and into the bath. She had the urge to be in control, to be one with him. For that she had to get control over her body and his mind. She closed the door, leaving him to get the bath ready.</p> <p>He turned on the water and adjusted the temperature till he was satisfied he was set to see more of her as she got off to the bath. Then he turned on the shower again and stepped in. He watched as her ass moved around, as he reached for his cock. He took it out, turned on the water, and stepped out of the bath.</p> <p>He looked down at her body. He couldn’t believe how sexy and desirable she was for him at that level. He was watching her with a mixture of lust and curiosity as she had the bath water running, so she was still naked. He grabbed the soap and started lathering up her tits, her stomach, and then he began to wash her legs, moving downward toward her mound.</p> <p>He got out the soap and started the water again, and got in there. She let go of the water and started to rub her body up and down. She slowly moved her hands all over her tits, moving downward so she could do some body hair so she could wash him. She rubbed his dick into her stomach, and then moved back so she can massage it.</p> <p>When he was finished rinsing her tits, she grabbed his cock and started to jerk him off. His hands gripped the shower wall as she jerked him. She moved her hands down to rub her soaking pussy lips and move around her clit—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
