I know you have a way of dealing with it, honey. I'm your mother. You can talk to me when you wish. I am your mother."</p> <p>"Mom, I've told you before, I've been around the block but you know me. I'm not that good company and no one cares. How could I ever be with you as long as I like?"</p> <p>"I've told you that before, honey, but you always told me it would be easier if you only knew who you were looking for. You've been through a lot. I'm just glad you found some man that has a brain and a heart," she cooed.</p> <p>"Mom," I said, softly, "my mom's a beautiful person, but I am not that kind of young man that I want to mess with your friends when I know better for who I really am."</p> <p>She turned around, grabbed the phone and looked at me. She dialed a number and asked for my dad, I assumed she had just told him she was my mother?</p> <p>"I'll be right there," she snapped.</p> <p>"No it won't be that easy," I said. "There are three of us here. How could I have possibly not known? Please don't think this was a one-time thing, mom, but you know that. I can't promise this will be the last time we see each other, but I'm not trying to be, and I'll try to be on my best behavior. The truth is, mom, I need to find a way to thank you for what you did for me when I wasn't able to have a father. I don't deserve any of the things I've just gotten into. Please, mom, give me a chance. If I can't find a way to thank you, can I?"</p> <p>"I think you're right," she smiled.</p> <p>She reached up and kissed me. Her fingers went to my lips. I kissed her back. I put my hand in her hair and gently pushed her head closer to mine.</p> <p>"You look good to me," I said. "I've wondered about what it would be like to kiss you like that."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, honey," she whispered. "You're really an old guy."</p> <p>"It's okay. I'm only 40. Do you know how much older I am, actually?" I pointed to her face. "Well, I'm not in that old crowd anymore. What about you?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I've been here for years, but..."</p> <p>"You're still young, mom. I'm 23 and you're just 21. I'm not doing anything anymore. I promise."</p> <p>"Do... do you... plan on going back to college again?"</p> <p>"No," dad said, "that's all the way too young of it. I love this town better than I love the city or the whole world. I can't even put my nose on it with the world right around me.</p> <p>"I know where you're headed, honey. When is tomorrow?"</p> <p>"Saturday... that's Thursday," she said, "and if it's possible, mom I want to make you feel like a special man."</p> <p>She looked at me, a tear running down her cheek. "I always feel special, too. I've never felt like this before... and you... I just wanna be with you again," she said.</p> <p>"Yeah, we'll see," I said.</p> <p>She reached out and kissed me, deeply. It was a loving, gentle kiss, one that told me that she was truly there for me. She didn't make love, did all that, but she did get it all over the first few minutes that we were together. It was an adventure, a different world altogether, a way of life that one could change at least to think of it. If I hadn't been going to this party and not to my dad, I would have been surprised at the degree her age was able to be with me.</p> <p>I'm a little older. I'm definitely a more experienced person and, when you're older and have a lot of money, if you want to do it at your own pace, do it. Mom isn't your Mom. I'm your dad. I'm your dad. What will you do if you want to? What will I do if I want to see your mom again?</p> <p>Mom pulled away, looked at me and smiled. She turned and walked towards where the men were standing in our backyard. She stopped next to me and bent down and kissed me as I sat on a lawn chair. It was an intimate, loving, beautiful, passionate kiss. God, I felt like I needed to do something in thisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
