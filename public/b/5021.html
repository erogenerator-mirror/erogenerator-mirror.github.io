I really shouldn't have done that. I wanted to feel the other woman's body.'</p> <p>'Your body?'</p> <p>'Yes, and her pussy. It was lovely.'</p> <p>'Kissing the woman while she was naked was something I wanted to watch.'</p> <p>'Well, what were you waiting for? Go on and do it. Go on kiss the other woman. Kiss my best friend's pussy.'</p> <p>I kissed her mound, moving the towel to the side. I flicked my tongue across the clit that was now standing up like a flagpole, and she groaned.</p> <p>'Lick me. Lick my cunt,' she said.</p> <p>I leaned back on my heels and lay my head on her mound, my tongue working over her labia. She writhed on the floor while I licked and kissed her wet cunt, and when I finally managed to push my tongue into her, she moaned. She came when I started to finger her, and moaned again as I thrust two or three more fingers up her cunt. I pulled her hips up with my fingers, and as she cried out, I pushed my thumb against her anus. She groaned and I felt her ass tighten in response.</p> <p>She screamed, and I felt my own pussy twitch as she climaxed again.</p> <p>'I love you.'</p> <p>'I love you too.'</p> <p>'What did you do then?'</p> <p>'You made love, not kissed me. I had no intention of doing it again.'</p> <p>'You didn't,' she said, smiling.</p> <p>'So, you're not married?'</p> <p>'No, I'm not. I just turned 18 yesterday.'</p> <p>'I see. Well, if you're not with your boyfriend then this is your first marriage, isn't it?'</p> <p>'Yes.'</p> <p>'You're sure I'm not on our side? You're certainly not on my side, aren't you? You love me, don't worry about marriage and loving your boyfriend.'</p> <p>'I don't know, but it's difficult to say that when it comes to it. There's no wedding or anything like that, let's just say we can't talk about it. You'll have to ask me now.'</p> <p>'It's true, you can't ask me. I'm not your real friend. This is just something you're trying to be your friend.'</p> <p>'It's not your thing. I don't care. So, tell me about your first girlfriend. Is she your first? I thought you two had to be friends.'</p> <p>'No. Her first girlfriend doesn't really matter to me,' she said, as if answering a question.</p> <p>'Well, I'm not happy with you. I want to help you, you know.'</p> <p>'You don't need to do that. I've got a boyfriend.'</p> <p>'You won't be able to help me. It's my fault.'</p> <p>'We already know that, but you're not in need of her help.'</p> <p>'She does everything she can to help me. I'm not going to take advantage of you.'</p> <p>'You should.'</p> <p>'She has been giving me these same kind of trouble. I can't do anything about it, but you should find someone who knows what they're doing.'</p> <p>'I'll find someone.'</p> <p>'Good.'</p> <p>I moved back and stood up, and looked at her. She was smiling, like the cat that had got the cream, even though it was now time for her to get back to work.</p> <p>I leaned forward and kissed her forehead, then her chin, and the bridge of her nose.</p> <p>'I love you. I'm sorry I'm a little late, but I'm not responsible for what happened.'</p> <p>'I know, you can say that again. I felt so selfish.'</p> <p>'No you don't. I'm sorry I'm a mess.'</p> <p>I kissed down to her breasts, kissing first one one, then the other. My mind was in my own head, but it was too late. I had been so close to making love to her that a couple of days ago, now I was close to taking her. She hadn't made it easy.</p> <p>I had to take my clothes off in front of her, and I pulled up my own panties and stepped into my bra, adjusting the straps so that it didn't look so plain. She was still out of the bathroom, so I had to sit on the bottom rung of the washing chair. I pulled my legs up so that I was almost sitting on the edge, and I leant forward and pulled her overâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
