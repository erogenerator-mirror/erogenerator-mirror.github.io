"I haven't planned on getting home to that young lady, but my plane is almost ready, and she should be out by about noon. Now, it appears, that you should go home."</p> <p>She was about to say something to him, but his words stopped her. "Listen," he said. "I'll go with you to the airport and wait for you at your desk until the morning." He took her arm and led her past the other side of the room, still holding a suitcase in each hand and led her toward the door. He opened it slowly before she could protest, then said, "I don't want anyone to come knocking at anything until the very end. Just go home." At the bottom of the stairs he walked out into the lobby and closed the door. The lobby was empty except for a few people coming and going down the elevator and down the hall, but he didn't care. Instead he turned his head and gave her a long, meaningful look as he got into the car and drove off down the street. Not a word was spoken as they drove to the airport and the next morning when they picked up their bags at the baggage office, they left a note thanking him for breakfast and telling him that she hadn't eaten well and would be back around noon.</p> <p>As they were driving away, Sarah stood close to him. She turned toward him and whispered, "Thank you for letting me stay with you for the day."</p> <p>He raised an eyebrow while smiling but said nothing. They drove home in silence, the only sound being the gentle click of their heels as they made their way toward the door. When he opened it, the room was empty except for the single bed and a blanket, and she turned toward her door. "Aren't you going to say good morning?" she asked playfully.</p> <p>He smiled. "I don't want to," he said, "that's what I'm here for."</p> <p>She pulled her robe from the loops by the front door and stepped naked from her seat as she began to undress. The movement caused her tits to spill out of her robe, until it dropped to one foot. Her nipples puckered and rose at the slightest breeze. She bent to unhook her corset and it fell to the ground around her feet, leaving her naked body completely exposed. She turned toward him as he got out of his coat, allowing her tits to bounce and jiggle. She reached out and pulled the towel from his hands and let it fall to the floor. She stood before him, her breasts jutting out like two mountains, the nipples hardening from the cool air. She walked back toward him, and his hands moved to the hem of her robe. She lifted her arms, dropping the towel as she did so, her tits jutting out and hard from the effort. She slowly slid his suit off of him, his dick making contact with her belly as she reached down to his member, pulling him toward her.</p> <p>He helped her remove his jacket and tie, tossing them to the side. Then he knelt in front of her, taking the robe over his shoulder to wrap around himself. He took a breast in each hand and squeezed, pulling them toward him. Then he licked his way up the center of her chest, stopping to nibble at her nipples while she stood in front of him in her white bra and underwear. Her hips swayed with each motion he made, the silk rubbing against her pussy. Then he stood up and led her to the bed. He began to take her panties off as they laid. The sounds of his heavy breathing mixed with hers were a symphony of erotic pleasure, their bodies swaying in unison. His hands moved toward the waistband of her panties, the elastic quickly slipping down her legs, the fabric falling to the floor at her feet. She lifted her backside upward so he had access to her pussy. He pressed his finger against her lips while his other hand slid around her, lifting the back of her thighs and separating her lips. He rubbed his thumb against her clitoris causing her to moan. He pushed his finger deep inside her, his thumb rubbing against her G-spot as he inserted it all the way in her pussy. She ground down with her hips, driving her clit into his hand as he sucked her nipple hard. His thumb rubbed against her G-spot as she continued to come, her whole body straining with desire. She knew he wouldn't be able to come until she did. His hand continued to rub her clitoris as her whole body convulsed, a string of tiny gasps escaping from her lips each time he pressed and pressed that final muscle deep inside her. Finally she collapsed onto the bed, herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
