And with the exception of my mother in law's visit, I just didn't have time to work. I was getting a good tan and getting into my car when the phone rang.</p> <p>"Hello?"</p> <p>"Good morning, Paul? It's Ann, I have a question for you," I paused to sip on my coffee when I heard her say it.</p> <p>"I'm sorry to hear that, Ann I'm a little worried. When you told me you had decided to visit Europe, I was worried because of his mother. I guess that's just for you. I'll be a little more patient in the future, Paul," she responded.</p> <p>"I'm glad you enjoyed your stay here, but we'll work out how to proceed as you get ready. Do you need anything?"</p> <p>"Actually no, I'm getting a lot more comfortable, but I don't want to keep you waiting."</p> <p>"Let me call my friend in Europe and see if we can get you and your mother to come over and join us for breakfast."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The next morning, I woke up as usual and felt a little apprehensive about my visit. I had to work until noon on a Tuesday so I had a day off. As day began to settle into evening, I picked up a book I had just started reading and went home and changed into a bathing suit and sat on one of my beach chairs to read a book I had brought home last summer in the time I was there.</p> <p>About an hour or so had passed by when I heard the ringing of the phone on my own home phone.</p> <p>"Hello?" I answered. "It's me, Paul. I'm coming over for breakfast. Do you mind driving?"</p> <p>"I am having breakfast, but you'll have plenty," Ann answered, the tone in the conversation being that she had just come over to my house and was leaving for the airport. "What I want to know is, do you have any idea how to arrange to go to Europe after this holiday?"</p> <p>"I don't know, it's a strange situation in that I guess I'll have to resort to an attorney. I'll have to find someone in England or some other country," I explained. "I'll have to give you time to put it into an emergency."</p> <p>"Thanks for your time, I'll talk to you later. Bye."</p> <p>Just as she hung up the phone, I heard the car pull into the driveway and I was back in the car as soon as I heard her tell me to have a good morning. I started the car and got behind the wheel and we drove out, got out of the driveway, and walked in to check out the town ahead. It was early so I went to a local supermarket to buy a couple of sandwiches, before pulling in to the interstate for a coffee break. When I got home, I saw that Ann was nowhere to be found and quickly checked the phone, making more of a decision than a call to see if I could connect them. I got my coffee, put on the newspaper as I sat at my computer and started to make some phone calls. The morning progressed quickly and I took advantage of the time that it was time. Ann was still at my house so I let myself inside and found some sandwiches prepared. After I had my coffee and my sandwich, I went back home and got out some groceries and started to put them into the kitchen along the back wall. When we sat inside and took out the groceries, I was surprised when Ann and Paul came in to see me. I explained that I thought the food looked great and that we would be finished for the day and we would eat in Ann's room, since she would be sleeping in my guest room. Ann was happy to hear this and gave me a big kiss on the lips that lingered only a minute, before telling me she loved the extra attention.</p> <p>After getting a warm cup of coffee and some fruit-soak in the fridge, I went back inside and put on a robe as they continued to eat. Ann joined me as soon as she got our breakfast as she was carrying her backpack, suitcase, clothes, and a couple of beach things in her hands. When Ann entered the kitchen, she said with a big smile. "I've thought about joining you all day but we're not here to do anything. Since I'm already in town, you can just go away for a while and stay, just to be with Paul. That won't be long, just for a few days but just until I am ready to leave."</p> <p>I was happy when Paul volunteered the time for me to cook breakfast. It also caused a delayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
