"Can I?" he whispered with a twinkle in those eyes.</p> <p>Cyrus was still recovering but it wasn't the whole world that mattered. His parents were gone most of the time and he'd always have a quiet time. Of course he didn't want to upset the mood of his parents. That and they were away, that's when it would start to make things that much clearer. "Sure." He replied hesitantly, not sure he wanted to go through with it.</p> <p>With another mischievous grin he looked a little sheepish as he sat on the couch and then sat sideways on the arm. "That's nice..." he said, "Do you have anything on under that skirt?" he continued.</p> <p>He had a pretty good idea of what the answer would be but she wasn't about to give him away any more than that. "Maybe," she said, "I'll just wait for you to come home."</p> <p>He chuckled. "I'm sure you're right." He answered with confidence.</p> <p>She smiled. "You don't think I have any on under this skirt?" she asked, innocently.</p> <p>He grinned. "Well I'm sure you wouldn't want everyone to see us, would you?"</p> <p>"Maybe not everyone," she retorted playfully.</p> <p>"Maybe not," he said as he got up and came back with his shirt down.</p> <p>Cyrus sat back on the couch and crossed his legs. He pulled the chair closer to him and pulled down the zip of his pants. He could still see her, but what he did couldn't see too much. He pulled down his boxers and sighed when he saw the first erection he'd ever had. "Oh my," he breathed.</p> <p>In response his fingers crept over the shaft and began to stroke it, feeling it grow stiffer and longer. His eyes were glued to his hand on his own cock and his mouth gaped open from her staring. His eyes quickly went back to her lips and then down to her exposed pussy, where his hand seemed glued to her. He was lost in his own world but kept on stroking her gently, trying to match her hands on his own. Her legs were still pressed together and her hands were clasped behind her back. She began to giggle and he was surprised she wasn't protesting it. She didn't seem that shocked by the thought of being groped by someone she didn't know. They had never had much of anything going on.</p> <p>"That feels nice," she exclaimed, "and your hand feels nicer than it has."</p> <p>This made him laugh and even if he hadn't been, he knew a little truthfully. It felt good but in a weird way it made him think of things that made her feel good to him. He had never been one to make judgments or even to ask about what was and wasn't. He figured she was going to start giving in to him if that were going to happen. He was pretty sure the thought of her making fun and using it to control his life was going to make him cum in less than a minute.</p> <p>She began to shake and his mouth dropped open and his eyes bugged as she continued to bounce and shake on his hand. He looked up and met her eyes, her lips were slightly parted and his gaze trailed up to her face. He knew what she was thinking.</p> <p>"It doesn't matter to you whether or not you want it to, huh?" he smiled.</p> <p>She giggled again. "If you want any kind of explanation you'll need to make those thoughts and feelings from me. I won't do anything with you, no questions, just the knowledge that it's your body you're feeling isn't making any difference."</p> <p>"I don't know, you're right but I couldn't be any worse for wear after that," he replied.</p> <p>She leaned closer and brought her lips up to his and kissed him lightly on the lips. He was surprised and kissed her back back in return. She pulled away suddenly and started to turn over the couch. With a grin she said, "Come on! Let's go do it."</p> <p>In response he pulled on the hem of her skirt then she pulled his shirt back over his head.</p> <p>"I was trying to make fun of you and made a terrible joke," he smirked. "Don't think it's going to stop us doing this if I just put both my hands on you again."</p> <p>She nodded. "I'm still going to have to get to know you better, so just do as I say."</p> <p>Giggling again he stood up and followed her to the bedroom. She sat him on the bed and sat with her back to him and looked up at him. "I want you to be honest with meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
