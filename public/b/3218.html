"You have to be in my room tonight."</p> <p>"Oh, my! I think I'll just stay here all day. That'd be nice."</p> <p>His mouth curved into a big O, but he tried not to show a little smugness.</p> <p>"I was just kidding! I've missed you so much! Where are we going, lover?"</p> <p>Her reply was a slow smile, and he felt himself become slightly aroused by her, not that he'd really been that horny when they started their new journey. She'd definitely been good to him. He'd never felt her so completely in his life.</p> <p>"Come in when you're ready, lover."</p> <p>She nodded and he reached up slowly, kissing a trail down her neck and across her collarbone, and he felt her tense beneath his mouth. He continued kissing and licking and suckling as his hands roamed her body, slipping a hand down to cup her small, firm bum cheeks.</p> <p>"Oh, God!" she gasped and pulled his head against her chest, then she kissed his neck and throat, a light sucking action causing him to arch against her.</p> <p>"Come on, then, I'm ready for a ride," her reply was an almost purring moan.</p> <p>He felt the hem of her dress lift up a little and he slid a hand higher until it slipped under the elastic of her panties. She was already soaking and he teased her, rolling onto his back and lifting his legs off the bed. She moved up in a kneeling position astride his thighs and looked into his eyes, her expression tousling and her mouth half open with anticipation. The smile on her face made him dizzy.</p> <p>"Take the dress off, baby, let me see those beautiful, firm breasts."</p> <p>She did as she was told and slid the material down off her boobs and watched him closely as she eased herself back onto his legs, the dress sliding gently over her hips as she lowered herself over him.</p> <p>"God, you are so hard!" she gasped and sat down on him again, sinking herself onto him as she moved slowly up and down, his length feeling bigger, bigger, her insides hot against him as she settled onto him.</p> <p>She began to move up and down again, moving on him in a blur of motion. He heard the sounds of it as her body moved and shook and writhed, moving ever so slightly as she moved, the noise becoming louder and softer in the pitch. Her arms went above her head, her hands going up to grasp her breasts and squeeze and tug at the flesh, making her gasp and moan even louder, her cries of pleasure punctuated by occasional cries of pain or ecstasy. She lifted her hand behind her and clutched at the cheeks of her bum, holding them up slightly so he could see the puckered opening of her bottom. The tiny gap between them as she moved against him seemed to enhance his arousal, and he felt his face flush even more. "Take your bra off, and then turn around, my love."</p> <p>She felt herself slowly rising up and down on him, moaning and shuddering and feeling the tingle her skin sent up her spine, her insides tightening and pulsing with her rising. He felt the softness of her breasts against his chest. She lifted herself down once more, almost impaling herself on him, and he felt himself slowly growing even more erect. Her fingers clenched her breasts, massaging them against him, and she lowered herself more firmly against him.</p> <p>He felt himself rising again and she felt him surge inside her, and she felt him pulsing as his cock swelled and throbbed, his juices shooting into her, making her orgasm stronger than any she'd ever let him feel before. She lay still on him, feeling her body trembling and hot and flushed and trembling as she felt him come inside her.</p> <p>She felt him soften inside her and her sex tighten again as she fell on him, her whole body seeming to shudder with the intensity of her need, and her lover's hand cupped her face, his thumb pressed into her nose before moving down and pushing against her lips. She leaned his head back and closed her eyes, her body convulsing gently against him, the sensation of him in her making her feel deliciously randy.</p> <p>"Let me feel you now," he said softly. "And make love to me the way you want to, all day long."</p> <p>They lay silently for a long time, he stroking her skin, his hard length pressing against her belly and his cock still buried deep inside her.</p> <p>"I think this is going to be a day spent together, lover."</p> <p>Her breathing was hard as she stroked his face, his strong eyelashes.
