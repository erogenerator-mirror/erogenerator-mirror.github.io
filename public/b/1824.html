The only one who seemed to want me was the one that was my friend and one of my lovers.</p> <p>I had a job that I was working on and that I wanted to attend. I was looking forward to it now. I had no family that would need to be around. I was single.</p> <p>All week. I was thinking about the coming week when I saw some pictures of myself on holiday vacation and my sister. The day passed without a word. We sat down to lunch. My sister came to my rescue by saying she was coming with me. I accepted it. That was nice.</p> <p>On the drive home she was talking to me. Then she had kissed me.</p> <p>I was confused but happy to kiss back. I knew how she felt about kissing her friend right there in the mall. That was the last I saw of her.</p> <p>When we got to the dorm room room we kissed and hugged. I felt excited then sad at the same time. I would miss her.</p> <p>When she left I just lay there. But I wasn't sure I liked it. I was still looking for this. I had been looking but now my thoughts were on her.</p> <p>I was still in a haze when I heard the sound of my sister coming home. I was getting worried. I had just been thinking of her when my cell phone rang. It was my girlfriend.</p> <p>"You're home."</p> <p>"I know how you feel. What's wrong?" I said sarcastically.</p> <p>"Is everything okay?" I didn't want to hear that I felt bad about what was happening.</p> <p>"Of course it is. What's up?"</p> <p>She got down on her knees and asked me what was going on. She told me things were a little strained. We didn't say anything for a while but then she asked me why I was still in school. I asked what she expected so badly.</p> <p>"There is one thing I want to know but I couldn't say it."</p> <p>"What is that?"</p> <p>"Have a look at your notes."</p> <p>I handed her my notes. This time she saw that. I couldn't even say that with a nod, although I tried.</p> <p>I looked at her notes and started to read. Before I had my full attention she took my hand.</p> <p>"This is about what happened."</p> <p>I felt so shocked she had said that. She went on for a long time when all it was was making sense. She was my first teacher.</p> <p>"That's about what happened." I started to explain.</p> <p>"No." She started to say.</p> <p>"What? What happened?" I couldn't hear a bit of what I was saying.</p> <p>"If you can just let go of that little bit of stuff you have right now it seems like what you need to know."</p> <p>She had tears in her eyes.</p> <p>"I told you it was going to happen. Don't think it hasn't happened before." I heard something like a bit of a laugh in her voice.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I said to her.</p> <p>"Yes. Yes I am."</p> <p>"Then what is the problem?"</p> <p>"This is not going to be like it once we start talking about how it was between you."</p> <p>"If you say so. What's going on?"</p> <p>"You know," she started. "This is how I saw it last week. I think part of me wants to stay in school for as long as they will permit but another part of me wants to change colleges. I see you all the time I know. Part of me, my feelings are different things. I guess I just never really thought about anything else the same as you did. I mean, I am kind of in love with you but we both have feelings for you. It's just that I am happy you're not the first teacher I met in college."</p> <p>"That's an old story," I said quickly. "It's been in my head for a long time."</p> <p>"No, it was a good one and it can wait."</p> <p>"No." I was shocked. "It took a long time."</p> <p>"So this might be the reason you're doing this." She asked me.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want me to tell you?"</p> <p>I was now getting scared. "I'm not sure. I have a lot of questions."</p> <p>"All the questions I think you will ask me." She said with a grin and her eyes.</p> <p>Then she kissed me. I could have sworn she was just a bit shocked. But before I could even think of telling her that I was coming home I heard her scream and then her voice was over and her whole body shook.</p> <p>I hadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
