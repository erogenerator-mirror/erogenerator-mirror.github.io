You are such a good boy." She was right. She was all the way across the store, my heels and panties still on. She opened the curtain and turned to stare at me.</p> <p>"Come in there," she said. I was just about to ask her for her name when she looked directly at me again. She smiled coyly and said, "And...?"</p> <p>I blushed and said, "I...I-I'll meet you out front in 15 minutes."</p> <p>She closed the curtain and turned around with a big smile. "I always knew you were a naughty boy, but now I... oh, yeah, I'll walk you to your car, but I... you know..." She laughed and winked.</p> <p>By this time, I was already walking toward his car. I was wearing a pink and white polka-dot lace camisole, which barely covered my nipples and which showed the top edge of my lace bra and gave me a peek at the side of my bare stomach and my legs. I'm not sure what I was thinking about, but watching her move toward the parking lot wasn't helping. I wanted to stop, and I certainly didn't want to walk with her so close to her. I didn't think she'd say anything, but she just looked so beautiful, so desirable and so hot. There was a moment before I realized why she'd never come out of the store like that.</p> <p>"I had the biggest crush on you, but never really thought of you in a sexual way," she said. "That was so easy to say. It was my crush on you for years, but it kind of faded," she said. She pointed to her breasts and patted my back. "Now we can finally share a kiss."</p> <p>I couldn't resist. I wrapped my arms around her waist and gave a slow, seductive kiss. She moved closer and kissed me. I could smell the sweetness of her perfume on her mouth, feel the warmth of her tongue, touch her lips, taste her skin, and everything else.</p> <p>I pushed back and said, "Oh, that's so great." I felt like I wanted everything and didn't care what it was anymore.</p> <p>"But I think we should do this again sometime," she said.</p> <p>"We're not going to do that anymore. We may get in another accident on the way there," I said.</p> <p>She chuckled and looked at me. "I guess you're right," she said. "We're still new to this." She took my hand and led me to the car. "Why don't you start the car with the back seat right front." I did my best to comply, and the whole time, she seemed so happy. I think she loved me and I think she loved feeling safe in our relationship without being afraid to say so.</p> <p>We started the car and parked it on the shoulder. She took both my hands and moved my hands to her lips and kissed me full on the lips. "Do you really always wear that?" she asked, looking into my eyes and stroking my fingers.</p> <p>I nodded and smiled and said, "Yes I always have, but I don't always wear it to make you happy." She laughed and rubbed her hands under my sweater with both hands, while looking between my eyes and my mouth. "I never liked you that way," she said.</p> <p>"You knew it before I met you," I said.</p> <p>"Yeah. You're my best friend." I was surprised at her admission.</p> <p>I wasn't sure I wanted her to stop.</p> <p>I kissed her once again and asked again, "Just how was it?"</p> <p>"We're going to do a lot more than that," she said. Her words were a little over the top, but, no, I wasn't going to stop now. She took both my hands in hers and started caressing them and pulling them toward her breasts.</p> <p>I smiled and asked, "Do you like me like this every day?"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," she said. "You're so sexy," she said, kissing me again and squeezing my hands. I started unzipping her top. She moaned as I slid it down and she held both my hands around her breasts and lifted them, offering them for me. She smiled and sighed, but didn't remove her hands. I kissed both her nipples, gently at first, and she let me do that for a while.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful," she said and stroked my hair.</p> <p>She started rubbing the tips of her breasts against me again. "You're so fucking sexy," she said. Her nipples hardened even moreâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
