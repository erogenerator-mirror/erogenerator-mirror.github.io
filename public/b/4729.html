She hadn’t had time for eating and would be leaving town soon.</p> <p>After she put on a clean top, Ann finished cooking and prepared to leave for home. She looked back at her new outfit and smiled at herself in the mirror. ‘How do I look?' she thought to herself.</p> <p>‘You look stunningly good Ann’s eyes locked on her.</p> <p>‘Thank you’ Ann replied as she gave herself a long, deep kiss.</p> <p>Ann stepped to her closet; the large, oversize mirror behind the door. With her hands in her pockets, she turned. She quickly grabbed her clothes and headed for home thinking that there wouldn’t be much to look at now. Ann quickly started to make dinner.</p> <p>The day dragged for Ann as she packed her things into a new outfit. While she was on her way to the grocery store, she tried to keep her mind on her job. Her fingers were starting to get tired so she decided to head home where she could get a nap.</p> <p>Ann had been feeling restless all day. Her mind was beginning to wander, as she wondered if what her new friend was really doing had anything to do with her being turned on by watching porn, just as she was. It didn’t take long for her to realize this was probably not going to be a sexual thing. Ann, with her back straight, was not going to be able to focus on her work and make a decent meal. If there was a point in her job, she wasn’t going to argue with herself. Ann tried to stay focused on putting on her dinner while she still remembered the day.</p> <p>Suddenly, Ann felt her cell phone vibrating in her hand. She took the phone from her pocket and noticed a message.</p> <p>“Ann, your place is a mile or so from here.”</p> <p>“Ok, I'm ready, can you tell me where I should park my truck and get to work?” Ann whispered.</p> <p>“Yes, I'll be there in 15 minutes, be out by the pool in the back at 9am.” He said.</p> <p>Ann headed out to the pool wearing her bathing suit. She had hoped to stop by the house first. Ann took off her swim suit to show her naked back and to tease herself a bit with her thoughts. As she walked up the stairs, the sound of Ann's phone ringing started to pick up.</p> <p>Ann picked up the phone and was surprised that it was her friend, Ann.</p> <p>“You there? How are you? Please tell me something is going on. Please hang up.” Ann said.</p> <p>“Ann you can go right in on that, you're my guest.”</p> <p>“Yes, I'm sorry, I’m just heading to get changed into something nice to wear. Where are we?”</p> <p>“Just walking through the house. I just stopped off by the grocery store for a cup of coffee.”</p> <p>“Ok, thanks for the invite.” Ann replied.</p> <p>Ann had picked up another couple of robes from the store and was now deciding on whether to wear one to bed tonight or even a nightie, she was so excited. She started off by walking through the house. Ann couldn't believe how everything looked so perfect. She saw a door leading to the pool and figured that would be her room. Ann headed down to the back yard. As soon as she reached the door she saw it was attached to a set of stairs.</p> <p>Ann walked up the stairs and felt the warm pool water on her bare shoulders. She looked back and saw Ann on her back sitting in a reclining chair. She took off her clothing and lay flat on her back. Ann knew she looked spectacular; she never thought another man could do this.</p> <p>Ann couldn't believe how she felt as she lay there. Her hands and arms were starting to feel tired. She turned around until she was face to face with John. Ann could feel him looking down at her breasts. With one hand, Ann ran her other up and down her stomach until her palm encountered a wet cloth. Ann carefully wiped herself clean after soaking her pussy dry with water.</p> <p>“Do you want me to wash you off while we do this?”</p> <p>“That would be fine. It’ll only take a few minutes. I'll wash myself back then turn you over to rinse.” Ann stammered.</p> <p>“Ok, I think I can deal with that.”</p> <p>Ann began to make herself stand and remove her swimming bottoms, when she heard the water stop—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
