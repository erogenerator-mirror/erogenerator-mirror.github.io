Her friend was behaving like a slut, and she couldn't bear to see her friend shame all over her. This was the worst thing that could happen. She started to pull away, but Lizzy was too strong.</p> <p>"Don't worry, sweetie...don't fight me," Lizzy coaxed softly.</p> <p>"No," she hissed back, as she grabbed the back of his head and pulled his face toward her, "I love you, I don't want this to be like this."</p> <p>"Oh, Lizzy, I won't hurt you," James said with a warm smile, as he kissed her soft lips. "What's wrong?" he asked.</p> <p>"Oh, no!" she cried, "No, stop, stop!"</p> <p>"Mm, let me kiss you..." James said back.</p> <p>Lizzy tried to push him away, but his strength was wearing down. He pulled back and pulled a pillow over her head, covering her head with it. He was trying to kiss her tenderly on the mouth.</p> <p>"No," she said, "please stop, you're hurting me. Do you really like making me feel ashamed?"</p> <p>James was taken aback, and he couldn't say that. Lizzy was a sexy bitch, and that was not something he had ever known, and what he was trying to say was, well, wrong.</p> <p>The pillow was soon to be replaced by his face, and the gentle kissing resumed. James continued to kiss Lizzy. Her skin tasted lovely, and it felt wonderful to have him in her arms. Lizzy opened her eyes and looked straight in his face. She was a vision of loveliness, her mouth tasted of sugar and something else, but that's another story. She put her hands on his face, trying to pull him into her. His cock was at rigid hardness, and he didn't know where to begin. After a minute, she put her hands on his cheek, which was wet with blood, and she leaned forward, kissing him again.</p> <p>James put one hand on her shoulder near the back and pulled her towards him, so that she was straddling him without moving. Lizzy didn't mind doing this to him, so she kissed him again. He kissed her back, and he pulled her down slightly so that he could get his lips on her nipples. She was moaning, and she couldn't stop herself. At first, Lizzy just tried to kiss him on the lips, but he pulled her back, making her feel even more naked beneath his fingers.</p> <p>After a minute, Lizzy said, "What the fuck, James?"</p> <p>"Don't stop now," he said, and kissed her nipples again. He moved one hand around her body and slipped it under her skirt to touch her pussy. Lizzy jerked in shock and pain, when she felt his rough hand on her pussy. He didn't say anything about it, but he knew she was getting wet when he was rubbing her clit.</p> <p>She was embarrassed. She was furious that it was this way for her. James was her best friend. She was a whore for him, not to touch her...to kiss him in return.</p> <p>"Don't...don't..." she whispered, but she didn't have to get into it. "Oh, god, no...oh, fuck yes...oh, you bastard...oh my god..."</p> <p>She knew that she must have had a couple of orgasms, but she kept stopping herself. Lizzy looked down and saw that he had not stopped.</p> <p>"Please...please," she pleaded.</p> <p>"Oh, Lizzy, stop...stop...I'm sorry, I..."</p> <p>Still holding onto her mouth, he put his thumb in her mouth. She made a tiny sound, and then her mouth was locked on it, sucking it like a baby. Lizzy knew what was coming, but she couldn't stop. She couldn't help herself.</p> <p>She felt so hot, like a sexual firecracker was going off inside of her. She started to cry then, and she knew it was too late. She cried for herself, and told her she was sorry! This was what she had wanted; nothing could be worse than this, this feeling, the pleasure she got from this. She started to cry harder.</p> <p>James was so surprised by her body language, it didn't bother him. With a look of total relief, Lizzy finally got control of herself. He pulled her head back to his and kissed her again. This was so humiliating; how could Lizzy be letting him kiss her like this? He had to stop this...they were supposed to be friends and lovers.</p> <p>He said nothing about that, but Lizzy just kept crying, begging him, pleading him. She thought it would feel really goodâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
