"You're not going to get enough of that, are you? I'm just having fun trying it."</p> <p>"Well, if you're not, I can call you and come over. I just hope you don't mind if it's not for the best. I'm not sure I want it to be too weird."</p> <p>"No. This is fun, not like we're just sitting in your room talking about things you haven't even known for a long time."</p> <p>So, we ended up hanging out at my place for a night. I did get her to come and hang out at my place and, I have to admit, she liked it.</p> <p>A little about me: I'm a retired Navy Seal in the Middle East. I have been there a few years.</p> <p>One thing about me, is that I am a couple of inches taller than most Japanese and Middle Eastern men. For my age age is a pretty hefty one.</p> <p>"I always thought that you were a big oaf," my partner said, as I sat there talking to her. "Your hair's so damn long I can almost touch it with one hand."</p> <p>"No, it's very light and long," I chuckled. "I've been in enough hospitals already. I wouldn't really count on it being all that much."</p> <p>My friend's eyes kept going up to my face all the time. "Well, I think it'll be fine for you," she laughed.</p> <p>My thoughts immediately ran over what she'd said.</p> <p>"You know," my partner said. "My girlfriend and her boyfriend aren't going to go through with it if we bring guys home. They'll just sit around and talk until they're ready to do what they came here to do."</p> <p>My mind was racing, but everything came into focus.</p> <p>"We know you guys don't like that," she continued. "I mean, it looks so hot. But I don't want you going off and going somewhere we'll just throw a little back where you can't reach it without taking advantage of it, or at least to ourselves. No, I don't think it'd be a good idea if you didn't have friends to keep you occupied," her friend said. "My girlfriend is on the clock. I think what you're just doing is okay if you two are open and honest about it. Even the guys they're with are open and honest about it, but they'll just sit around."</p> <p>My mind raced with all kinds of possibilities.</p> <p>"It should be nothing for you," her friend continued. "Your friend has something on you and you need to be able to see anything through it without the rest of the world knowing."</p> <p>My mind was in the middle of the conversation. I'd thought of the whole idea of them walking up and down a street like that, but actually not.</p> <p>The only thing I could think of was that they could both be looking at it and I knew exactly what they were thinking about right now.</p> <p>"I know," she replied. "I told you that she is open. I understand why you want to come over and see it, but I think you'd be better in the privacy of your own house, you know, not the other way around."</p> <p>"If there were going to be anyone else around, then I'm sure they'd just take a walk," my partner said with a laugh.</p> <p>"I agree," I laughed at her. "At least you'll get to see it."</p> <p>"What do you think," my partner asked once we were both settled in. "Is it really okay if I borrow your place for a little while?"</p> <p>"Yeah, why not," my partner said. "Let me know if it's okay with you and you can hang out with your friends then. I'd love to talk with you guys sometime."</p> <p>As much as I knew that she and I weren't going to hook up for the night, it was like we were both in for it.</p> <p>My partner brought some lemonades out and placed them on the table on our small back porch. I sat quietly for a few minutes and just looked out at the peaceful view.</p> <p>It was a beautiful day. The air was crisp and clear. The sky lightened up and I decided to go for a walk along the island, looking out at the beautiful view.</p> <p>It was almost a full hour later when I came across a little blue lake. I walked up to it and saw that its surface was crystal clear and clean. The smell of vanilla and earth combined into a lovely blend.</p> <p>We sat on the grass, talking about what to do, and how to do it. My partner was in her early forties and still had a lot riding on her. She was still prettyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
