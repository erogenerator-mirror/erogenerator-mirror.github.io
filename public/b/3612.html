That was wonderful! I didn't know....ohhh....ohhhh.....don't tease......mmmmm........don't......touch......me....now it's my turn." I don't know exactly how many times he has had to do that because I know there are a lot of other ways he uses his fingers. His fingers are so...very strong, but this is a first for me. He pulled his fingers out and I knew it was only his first penetration.</p> <p>We spent the next few days fucking and sucking and licking each other and getting our pussies dripping wet. We knew we would make love to each other the best we could but there was also a part of us that thought it was all just fantasy for us. He told me he liked when he first fucked me, but he didn't really want to do it to me. He wanted to enjoy the way I felt during my first penetration because it was the first time he had touched me and the first time he had felt my pussy.</p> <p>That was the first time he thought about his first time getting it in me and then fucking me so hard that I had to hold on to a nearby tree until I couldn't anymore. Since he was not a fan of the missionary sex and just wanted to have my ass fucked he could get me that time. It sure was a turn on. He loved to watch me getting fucked.</p> <p>He got me this time that he was going to lay me down on my back to make it difficult for me to concentrate on him but as long as I concentrated on him and not on my own sexual needs I had to work with him. He was the first time a man had given me to an orgasm and it was mind blowing. He was so gentle as he slid his fingers in and out as I moaned and cried out in ecstasy. Sometimes he would move his fingers around in my pussy in circles as I came but mostly he licked me and sucked me to get me even more excited.</p> <p>We made love two or three times a week and we usually both had three or four orgasms before he would leave me to come again. He loved making those sweet lovemaking calls and the sounds I made when he finally had to leave me. He loved to lie with me after his lover had gone. He even liked coming in my mouth for me when I had just been doing it and he liked it so much he just came several times after we were both satisfied.</p> <p>We made a vow of secrecy to ourselves even when we were actually together. We would call each other from time to time to see if anyone else had done the same things. On those occasions we would just lie on our sides and we would make love with our partners who also enjoyed the same feel of our bodies while we were in the same state.</p> <p>It was the same pattern with both of us. Sometimes we would come together but at other times we were all together except when he was with me. We could also make love in the most intimate way of what we felt as though we were one body with one heart.</p> <p>It was our first time with anyone else. We had only had sex three times with two other lovers before we were able to get a repeat of that evening. We just took each other on our first try. I was a little shocked he asked me about our sex life but he explained that we didn't have a big thing, but that there was something about what you do as well as what you talk about so you could get more than two guys inside of you.</p> <p>We talked about how we liked it. He asked what it was like to be with a man who was in a relationship with his partner and he would tell me about his sexual experiences. It was really very personal and I have found that the most honest thing a woman could tell anybody as long as it didn't offend her as much as it did you. He asked me my sexual past and what I did when I was with a man. I had never been with a guy before but he made such a wonderful compliment that I told him it would be nice, but he had only said that it had to be one man. I told him I wouldn't go that far, though it would be a start. He was right about that but he wanted to know what that was like if I tried it with a guy.</p> <p>"Are you serious?" he asked. "You mean you want to try having sex with a real man."</p> <p>I thought for a few seconds and said "I might be crazy, but I think I will try it with you"</p> <p>"Well, I have heard the word wild from the women and they call it crazy. I'm not a wild woman and if you're interested in me, I'd love too. I can get you off if you would like."</p> <p>"I would love to try it with you, you know you wouldnâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
