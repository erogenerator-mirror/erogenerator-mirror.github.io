I have not been with a woman in seven years! She had not only her hair dyed into a thick sheen, she had a new light blue wig on top that added to the sexy effect of the new clothes. I watched her as she was dressed, and there was something about her that drew the man... I was surprised she hadn't had any other male customers.</p> <p>At dinner, my friend and I had no dessert. We went down to the beach to get the usual, and as I started to get ready to swim, my wife started to change off back into her bikini. I looked at her with a sly smile, and she looked down and smiled.</p> <p>"Is that really for me?" I asked with a broad smile.</p> <p>She shook her head and smiled at me, trying to get my attention. I knew what she was saying. After our little "chat" the rest of the evening, we parted without ever giving each other a kiss or even a brief hello.</p> <p>It was just after 1, when I woke up, knowing in some ways that my wife had to leave that evening.</p> <p>I was lying on an edge of the pool in my suit, when I heard the sound of a door closing. I knew it had been her, but was surprised when I felt her door lock slowly behind her. As I got up to try and get dressed again, I saw another girl entering our pool area.</p> <p>I opened my eyes, and there she was, standing at the edge of the pool, completely naked and dripping wet by the end of a tub of water. She was still smiling at me as I approached.</p> <p>"Hi, Lover." She smiled and kissed me on the cheek.</p> <p>"Hi, Honey," I said, getting to my feet.</p> <p>"So good to be out..." She giggled. "Come on, let's get back to bed."</p> <p>I followed her through the door, and she opened the bathroom door a couple of steps before I did. We entered, and when I closed the door, I saw it was a large, but smallish, room. It was huge, with a huge mirror on the wall and a toilet opposite. There was a large mirror on the wall directly opposite the bathroom door, and there were two sets of stairs, one on each side of that door. On the first set of steps was our bathroom, and on the second, there was a bathroom door.</p> <p>She reached into the bathroom and pulled out the mirror. It was quite large, and had huge, clear glass windows that covered half the ceiling. The bathroom was just large enough to see under the mirror, and it was a very high quality room, with a big walk in shower at the far end. At the top of the bathroom, a large window from the outside overlooked and surrounded by a huge, marble fountain, was all that was really in the room. I guessed that my wife would not mind showing off that very much, and was pleased to see her showing off a little.</p> <p>I guess she was hoping that I would take things slowly, letting her dress her, and take all her clothes off in a minute or two. She started to undress, and I followed her actions, and stripped off my clothes before her. She was very pretty, very petite, but not in a bad way, and I had not seen her body in several years. It was long and slender, and had curves in all the right places. Her breasts were small, but just right for her figure. The nipples were pink, with only slightly larger areolas, and they really hardened as soon as I touched them. The lips of her pussy were small and thin, but very pink. It had a slightly darker patch at the end.</p> <p>We took our places in the shower stall, and I started to wash my wife, washing her beautiful, soft breasts. She started to moan and rub her pussy against my mouth. After about a minute, she got up to turn off the water, getting out of the shower before she could reach it herself.</p> <p>After she had dried off and got into bed, the door to the bedroom opened. Two naked black men walked in - both with erections, and one with a small white penis. Both of them had their hands on my wife's huge breasts as they looked at me. I could have cum right there, but was still surprised to see how aroused I was watching my wife being pleasured.</p> <p>They took their time, and I couldn't see what they were doing... But I could tell that they were getting off, and could feel how excited my wife was getting. They turned off their showers, and they left us alone as before. That was a little after two and a half hours ago. The only thing that seemed uncomfortable was my wife's naked, pink pussy, and my erectâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
