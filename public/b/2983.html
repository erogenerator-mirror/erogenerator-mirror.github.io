He was lying on his back. She loved it. He's always been the best lover in the world. She loved it too. She'd told him that she was a virgin. She didn't even realize how much she adored him. He's only 18.</p> <p>She leaned over his shoulder and kissed him softly. He tasted his own juice with her, it turned them both on. She could feel the rise of her juices on his leg. He looked down at her, his expression was loving. She loved hearing it. She felt the soft skin of his cheek on hers. She couldn't see a thing. He didn't need to see anything for that. They could talk as if it was normal.</p> <p>At that moment, she was surprised when she felt a hand between her legs and heard it. Not the brother's hand she had been fantasizing about. It felt different. It was smooth. The finger went inside of her and she could feel that feeling of a little girl. She liked being touched but it was different. It wasn't the one that he was fingering just then but it was different. The finger went in all the way. She felt nothing.</p> <p>He knew. She knew! She knew he was doing this. The finger went in and out of her now. She was in his hands now and she had never been this excited. He kissed her neck and his finger found her clit. She couldn't help but respond to that. She had been worried that he would notice. They weren't going to stop. All she had to do was keep going with it.</p> <p>Now they were doing it for real. It was hot. She felt her pussy squeezing his finger as he was fucking her with it. It was the most physical he'd ever made love to her. The feelings were so intimate she didn't even care that she'd cum. He'd given her what she had been searching for. She felt the first wave of it break and she didn't want it to last. He sensed that, too and he kissed his way across her cheek to her lips. The kiss was strong but gentle. He felt her kiss back.</p> <p>He pulled her in for one last kiss and then got up. He lifted her arms and held her close as he got into his truck. He turned the keys and the engine lights on as he pulled away. She looked up at him with big smile and told her to stay there. He pulled into a rest stop and the door opened. His brother's car got out as he pulled away. He opened the back door. They got out of the truck and Sophie followed as best she could. They went back inside. He got two more beers and said that if the rest was good, they should come back again. They got back in his truck and he set the cruise control to the correct speed and they moved to the next light.</p> <p>They were heading towards the back of the parking lot when Sophie stopped him. She started to say it was too late but he held his hand up. "Listen honey. It's really not that late. I'm taking you up to my room. We'll go to my room and spend the night."</p> <p>It was true. She was tired and he felt that too at the same time. He kissed her and got out of the truck. As soon as he closed the door, Sophie threw the beer cans on the ground and started stripping off her clothes. When she put some stockings on he got another big grin. She was still in that sexy little summer dress. He took her in his arms and kissed her again, much more passionately than she could remember. This time she could feel his stiff cock as they embraced. She was so horny at that point, too. Her mouth went to his ear. He stopped her. She stopped again.</p> <p>He led her to the bed and they lay on top of each other on the bed. When they weren't kissing, he was making his way down her neck and the valley between her breasts. He sucked each one in turn before moving to her nipples. Both his mouth and his fingers were teasing and tormenting them.</p> <p>They had no time to lie there much longer. One of them rolled into his lap and she moved him to a sitting position and straddled him. She positioned herself over his cock as she slid up and down on it. His penis filled her as he felt it go deeper. Suddenly, it didn't feel as much like a pussy that he'd been fucking her and he was having troubles getting the entire length into her. Her pussy seemed to be stretching to accommodate him. They both were breathing hard. This time when she started riding him it was an explosion. Her orgasm triggered. They both came together and when they had collapsed onto the sheets, they didn't even know that a couple more years apart hadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
