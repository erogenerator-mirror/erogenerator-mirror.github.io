No way, it has to be your own daughter!" she snorted.</p> <p>"I didn't bring you up. Dad said you had to be my older sister."</p> <p>I shrugged.</p> <p>"Nope. You just have to be the right age." she said, looking at my shoulder.</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess so. And he'll like it." I said, my mind a whirl of thoughts.</p> <p>"Is that good on our family? He never liked you much!" she laughed.</p> <p>"That's too bad, but since you put it like that, I guess it works."</p> <p>"So?" she shrugged, still looking at my shoulder.</p> <p>"So if you really are my sister, how'd you feel about being your younger?" I asked, hoping I'd said that wrong.</p> <p>Rachel laughed again, but a little softer this time. She got a mischievous look on her face.</p> <p>"You sure you want to go to see him?" she giggled.</p> <p>"We're going to have a reunion. I'm not that old." I said, looking at her.</p> <p>"It's not your reunion. We're going to hang out and talk. I'd really like you to be my sister."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I asked, concerned.</p> <p>"I've seen how he's always been looking at me. I've always been attracted to you."</p> <p>"Then you must be a little surprised. What happened to you looking at me before I knew?" I asked. Rachel looked at me, and said;</p> <p>"Oh, you mean, look at me while he and mom were... together?"</p> <p>I laughed and said;</p> <p>"Yeah, I kinda do. But still, it was really a little embarrassing."</p> <p>"Me too. I think he's a little worried about me. If he thinks it's ok, I've got it bad myself!" she said matter of factly. She laughed lightly.</p> <p>"Yeah, well, he's already worried that if he and your mom were together..."</p> <p>"Well, I know what you mean. If you're that interested, I'm game. Besides, he's always looking. I think he's really turned on. Like he's never been before, though." Rachel shrugged.</p> <p>"No, and to be honest, I've never really felt that way about anything." I shrugged and said softly,</p> <p>"So, if you're ok with it, how do you know you're going to be my younger sister?"</p> <p>Rachel smiled and said;</p> <p>"I guess it's just that he never really got around to asking me. I've always been afraid that he'd think I was some kind of creep."</p> <p>"Well, I think it's fun having a new friend, and it's always fun to have a new boyfriend." I said, putting my arm around her shoulders.</p> <p>"Haha! I can't get that!" Rachel laughed.</p> <p>"So, you don't have to worry about how I feel if I'm your sister." I joked. Rachel laughed,</p> <p>"Hey, you're not the only one that thinks like that. It does make me wonder what it would be like to watch his eyes roam all over your perfect body." Rachel said, laughing. I felt really stupid. We kept talking and joking around. Finally we made another beer and headed to the door. I was so nervous that I couldn't even walk with Rachel in my arms. We got inside and I kissed her on the lips. She did the same to me. I knew that it was going to be awkward and maybe I'd chicken out.</p> <p>"I was really nervous. I wanted so bad to, but I didn't know how to, even though you were saying how much you liked me." I whispered, looking into her face.</p> <p>Rachel smiled and said;</p> <p>"Why are you nervous, when you can tell someone else's body to feel nice?"</p> <p>"Because we're in a public place. It's very intimate." I said, looking up, and I noticed that she was staring right at the TV.</p> <p>"Are you really kidding me?" she laughed, "I'm not going to move, if that's what you're worried about."</p> <p>"Oh, no. I don't think I'd ever move very much with any one of your friends." I replied.</p> <p>"I think I'm getting into the relationship style. It's kinda fun." Rachel said with a mischievous smile on her face. I had some idea that we would try it out. Maybe we wouldn't be too comfortable with someone else watching us.</p> <p>"It's great that we have so much in common like that." I said, takingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
