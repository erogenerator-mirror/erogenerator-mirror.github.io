"But I'm married to her - I can't be responsible for her!" He blurted, "I can't let her do those things - with you - to her!"</p> <p>The boy sat down, "No... she shouldn't be doing that - she can't go to bed with her husband and a stranger!" He put his face back in his hands. "She shouldn't be doing it in our bed with you - because... that's not it!" He paused for a moment and then continued. "We don't even have a bed! And she'll - if you don't stop her then I'll break her - then we can do it!"</p> <p>It was the first time that the boy had ever said anything like that to a married man. However, he was very, very upset - he felt sick and he started to cry. "She just said that she loves me! That..." The boy sniffed and wiped his nose. "I don't know what it is - it's just... so... so..." The sobbing began to subside, but the boy continued. "But she's gone to bed with you - I can't do it with her! I'll - I'll go back to her. But I won't! Not with her!" He sobbed again and then looked at the ground. "And no more!" He said and began to put his robe on and leave.</p> <p>Before leaving the house, the boy held my hand tightly. The tears hadn't really begun to subside and he sobbed softly. "I'm sorry..." The tears continued. "...Forgive me - I've - I've betrayed you - I've been such a good girl." I shook my head and turned away. He stood there, eyes downcast, feeling like a child about to turn into a teenager. He looked back at me. "I'll be back." He walked towards me. "You can tell her." I turned to leave. When I was in the house, he stopped in his tracks. "You can have her. She'll understand if you can't!" He turned and looked at me again. "She loves me."</p> <p>"I've loved you for... for the longest time, I never wanted you to be alone. I've never felt that I was a real person." My breath left as I spoke and I felt my face redden; I took a deep breath. "I'm sorry... I'm still married." My voice was calm and matter-of-fact. "But this isn't some romp in the flesh - you can't make me..." His eyes opened wide looking at me. I blushed and looked away as he started walking away. "You can make her happy and you'll like her no matter who you're fucking. She loves you, she loves you, you'll be happy. And we love each other. I want to give you happiness, all of you have the right to love each others' bodies and breasts. We have all the time in the world!</p> <p>"And I want you!" He said, "And I want you to be happy!"</p> <p>I walked to him again. He was staring at my face intently. "I want..."</p> <p>"I want you."</p> <p>He stopped walking. I reached up to his neck and kissed him softly on the lips. "But I will be happy with her." I whispered. He nodded, then looked back at me. "All the time?" He asked. "No - at any time?" I nodded eagerly and kissed him again. "Well?" he asked. "Then I'll take her." I hesitated. "All the time." I repeated again and he broke my kiss, turned his head and looked deep into my eyes. "All the time." He repeated and then stared deep into my eyes. I couldn't believe I was actually going to let him do it! "All the time." I said again and put my hands on either side of his face. I looked him in the eye and began again. "All the time." I repeated. "All the time." He kissed me on the lips gently, so that if he pressed it too hard I might hurt the poor soul. I placed my hands in his hair and pulled his head to my lips. I moaned as our lips met and then began to kiss again softly.</p> <p>His lips grazed my lips and he stopped as we stopped. He looked down at me with his large, dark eyes and then looked into my eyes a moment longer. "You want me to tell her the truth, do you?"</p> <p>I looked at him, my heart beating so hard that it could have been cut diamonds in a fire. "But..."</p> <p>"But what?" He asked me.</p> <p>I wanted to go over to the couch and kneel.
