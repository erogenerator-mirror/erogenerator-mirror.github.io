We had made love many times with him in and out of that bedroom and in the shower. I wondered about how long we might last before we had to stop or get married. Now that I had the choice, and he knew what I would do, I knew we had nothing to worry about. I just knew he wanted me as badly as I wanted him. I knew that the mere thought of us fucking while our parents were out of the house would be enough to give us a sense of security. We always had the right idea and what we wanted from the time we thought of leaving that bed. But, we all knew we wanted it from the moment we found our way back home, from the moment we knew we could never have another home and what our future held.</p> <p>"What do you think? Is that the best course of action? Will you be my willing and faithful wife? What do you think?" he said over and over again as he pressed himself against me. His lips brushed my hair as we kissed hungrily, feeling the silky warmth of our mouths in sync as we kissed. "You know you are very good at seducing me. Am I right? Am I always a good sport about it? Maybe, yes, I will be, but no, wait until I get home."</p> <p>A deep sigh was all that escaped my lips as he pulled me closer to him. I wrapped my arms around his neck and he kissed me deeply as he ran his fingers lightly down my neck and over my shoulder, all the way to my breasts as he cupped them gently. He teased my nipples with his thumbs ever so gently, and then he pinched them and rolled them gently between his fingers, tugging on them as we kissed. My cock slowly but surely rose. I felt it pressing up against the thin line of fabric that his boxers left exposed. The sight of his body, pressed against mine, as he rubbed his own cock through the fabric, making me want to do it more. He pressed me closer to him as he slowly, sensually worked on me, pulling the hem of my dress out of the way and raising the hem higher and higher. He pushed my body closer to him, as I felt him touch the bare skin above his boxers.</p> <p>"You feel so nice," he breathy said as he kissed me again... "it feels good all the way up to here. You want me again?" he said in between his kisses.</p> <p>I nodded as tears of frustration ran down my cheeks before I spoke. He chuckled. "Yes... I do want you. I want to fuck you."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I said as he kissed me on the cheek. "It's just..." I paused as my eyes trailed off to the night table drawer... "well, I think we are really going to have to finish this."</p> <p>"I don't know if it's a good idea, or not," he said as his hands slowly began to unfasten the buttons on my dress... "but, you know you want it."</p> <p>"Yes," I said softly... "I do."</p> <p>He grinned... and slowly, with the slightest of strokes that would drive the point home, his fingers worked my dress from the bottom up until my bra and panties were exposed. I smiled wickedly as I felt his fingertips caress the tender skin of my tummy, and then he slowly worked his way to my hips and started to pull a bit of my underwear away from me. My mouth was agape and I couldn't stop the moan that would go out of my mouth.</p> <p>"You want me again?" he said as his eyes burned into my eyes... "I just want to tease you a little more."</p> <p>"You've got no idea. You always make me so hot knowing you are here, wanting me again. Your lips and tongue are always bringing me so much pleasure."</p> <p>My body tightened a bit more as he continued to pull and kiss my body. I was aware of my hard cock bulging against my pant leg, but I quickly looked away... for I couldn't help but imagine how he would feel in his boxers, running his hands over my body... caressing me... as he pushed me back against the headboard to tease me. As he pulled away to continue kissing my stomach, I suddenly felt his hands reach up and cup my breasts. His fingers found my now-hard nipples and started to run lightly over them.</p> <p>"I'm getting hard all over again," I hissed as I tried to press myself up against his body. "Ohhh..."</p> <p>He took both of my hands and pinched my nipples tightly as he held them up, giving little squeezes so that they were very, very sensitive. I loved the way thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
