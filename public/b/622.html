I asked, as he stood up.</p> <p>"I got her number," he replied, handing me my drink, "and then she told me what a great guy and a great lover she is."</p> <p>Before I could reply, he turned and walked away from her. She turned and stared at me for minute with her mouth agape.</p> <p>"What the hell did she do? How does she get her number from? Is she a prostitute?" She asked as she turned to face me.</p> <p>"Not for a long time." I replied, not being able to contain myself.</p> <p>"Well, I am looking forward to meeting you. I am not, however," she said looking me in the eyes.</p> <p>"So, you are meeting me? I can't wait to hear the story. I can't wait to hear what you did to that guy." I said, feeling my erection getting a little uncomfortable in my pants.</p> <p>"Well, there is no need to rush, but if you need to go, I will be back."</p> <p>With that, she walked over to the wall to turn the water off.</p> <p>"I have one more thing I need to do first. Do you need anything? I will keep the bar on ice until your back, then I am going to get my own!" She said with that sexy smile she had added.</p> <p>As I got up to leave, she handed me her phone.</p> <p>"Let me know if you need anything!" She said smiling.</p> <p>"Oh, I have to go. I will see you later. I am really looking forward to hear everything about you. See you soon!"</p> <p>With that she closed the door and locked it.</p> <p>I was trying to think of her name after the bathroom call, all the way to the door, but I could not think of anything. I could only hope that I didn't end up with a broken nose or a broken heart. I was determined that I would never tell the truth about my ex, because knowing her again, I would never let anyone know about my cheating. I would never tell anyone about the two of them, including the bastard that used her for his own sexual gratification.</p> <p>I couldn't believe what I had just heard. I don't even think she even knew that she had told him, or even that he had cheated on her. I had been faithful for 10 years now, and I still loved her. I could never admit it, but I didn't regret it at all. I was determined that, if she would never know about my feelings for her, I would destroy her with them. And I didn't know for sure if she would still like to try it. I loved her and I would never betray it. I am sure it was the truth.</p> <p>As I got out of the shower, I got the feeling it was going to be a long day. I grabbed my boxers and went into my room to get dressed and take a few minutes to sort my emotions out. I was determined to not let anything hurt either of us. Then, the doorbell rang. I opened the door and it was her. I was surprised. It wasn't me. I am sure, she realized it me when she came in. Her smile never wavered as she walked in the door.</p> <p>"I hope you don't stay for dinner," she said as she hugged me.</p> <p>"Not if it's just the two of us," I replied as my hands came to rest on her butt.</p> <p>"I will think about it," was her response, but she left me standing there for a minute or two.</p> <p>I started to get dressed and was trying to figure out what to do. She turned to leave, but she stopped short.</p> <p>"Do I really have to?" she said with a puzzled look.</p> <p>"Yes, of course you have to," I replied.</p> <p>I don't think she even thought about what I had said, because she reached up around my neck and gently started to pull me back. It wasn't a gentle peck. I leaned down and met her lips with mine. I had no intention of leaving this relationship for now.</p> <p>We kissed for 3 seconds or so, and I could feel her fingers starting to rub my cock through my pants.</p> <p>"I am so excited to know you still want me," she said coyly.</p> <p>"I'm excited to have you and I want you," I replied in a low, lust filled voice.</p> <p>"I have wanted this for a long time now," she said staring me in the eye.</p> <p>We kissed again and then she slowlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
