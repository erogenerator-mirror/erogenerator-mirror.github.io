She wanted him, but that seemed like far too far.</p> <p>"It'll be fun. After the game, I'm sure you have your camera handy, and then you can photograph me, but only if I'm in a state of undress."</p> <p>The last part was just so fucked up: what was there to say? Jillian just agreed and went back to work. Even with the camera out, she could see what was going on now. It had been all too close: she could picture how the other woman had felt and where she was standing and he did as well. Of course it was all right. Now if they were going to do it, she had nothing to worry about. Besides, it'd make it that easy. They'd had sex in the car on the way home and if they were going in the hotel she didn't need to wear something too, and nobody would drive too far.</p> <p>The camera came back again, showing her from the side again: he was taking a close-up of her tits as she leaned back on her hands. She smiled to herself. She wasn't sure what was going to happen next, and she was still a bit out of it.</p> <p>"Don't be afraid," he grinned. "Come and sit down." Jillian couldn't really see it but she could tell what was happening.</p> <p>His hands came up from her shoulders and she watched as they started to play with each other's nipples and play with the other. He was very close to her now - her own tits on the right and his touch on the left; both nipples were getting much firmer, with larger, darker areas of sensitivity. His fingers squeezed her breasts together as they were squeezed together by her chest: it was almost like he was kissing the flesh. It became her tits much more than she could see, except his hand was getting closer, closer.</p> <p>"I'm so horny," he said.</p> <p>"You are," she said.</p> <p>She couldn't see his fingers again, but he was going to be moving towards her now, her hand reaching out to get his, so she reached under him and grabbed his prick, not sure where she wanted it. He started pushing it towards her, so her hand held onto it, and it went between her legs and started rubbing her cunt.</p> <p>"Fuck me now," she heard herself say, but didn't really think it; it didn't really matter. He was pulling her dress off, but she held onto his prick as he pulled her onto it - and so they both sank down on it, kissing and playing with each other's breasts, then he pulled her to her knees and got back down on the sofa. She could feel himself getting really close now as he slid his shaft inside her cunt - which didn't feel completely ready, but would at least give her enough stimulation to get her over the edge. He bent down and took a nipple into his mouth and sucked on it, then held it by the base in his teeth and rolled it around with his tongue. He bit it a little harder now and then - she wanted him to suck on it, but he just kept going. When he was sure she was wet enough he started pumping his hard cock inside her. It wouldn't last as long as she liked, but it would finish off very nicely. He pushed his tongue inside, and she let his prick down a bit, letting it slide in and out of her mouth. It was so exciting, so warm and good.</p> <p>"Fuck me," she said. "Fuck me."</p> <p>He didn't think that was really a good start too, but it was close. He pushed his cock all the way in, then held it there as she squeezed her cunt tightly around him, then started moving his hand quickly on his prick.</p> <p>"Don't stop," she said, and she used her other hand to rub his face. "Now, fuck me. Fuck me."</p> <p>It was more of a challenge - her eyes telling him she really wanted it, not just the feel of her cunt, but her cunt in general, and what it would feel like after a real hard fucking. She started moving her hips again, getting the effect from when she was on the verge, not the way they had been before so many times before! That was good, she thought; it made it go faster.</p> <p>She felt like she was ready to take his cum. She was just getting started, but he was right on the edge. He was going for her clit now, and she felt him get more and more close to her. There were no more pretenses for him: he was about to fuck her. His prick was deep inside her cunt now, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
