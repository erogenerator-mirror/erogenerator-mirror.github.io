Why don't you give yourself to them? Your mother and grandmother said they just want money."</p> <p>"It won't do any real harm and it doesn't involve their money."</p> <p>"What's to stop it," I said, "I'll just run, I can't help you. And in case you're wondering my mother was going to be the one to kill them anyway. What they call her. The Widow."</p> <p>"But mom just killed someone. Why would she kill them now?"</p> <p>"To spite you."</p> <p>The woman didn't seem to notice that I was beginning to grow uncomfortable. But the Widow stood there looking straight at me. She spoke calmly with her hands on her hips, "Honey, we know you weren't being nice to them. Don't worry about it. All they did to me is tell us you gave them to someone else."</p> <p>"How could I be nice," I said, "I don't understand why they would do that to you?"</p> <p>"Honey, we're not that close. I only did it once. It was in Europe and that was so painful. I was very young, so it was hard. I was not the best in bed. I only did it once and it hurt. So I didn't know what to say to them, but to keep quiet and it didn't really hurt them."</p> <p>"So if they killed your mother and it didn't affect that then you don't want them to kill yourself?"</p> <p>The Widow looked confused, "My father didn't want that. He took out his wife, they didn't have sex, and he's not so far gone. We came down here to have a good life together and you know that is true, right?"</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"In any case, you're going to have to do something about the kids and their mother."</p> <p>She was silent. It was apparent that she was trying to decide what to do. Then she looked up and said; "But they won't even know."</p> <p>"That's the problem," I said, "they don't know the first thing about what we are. We just do what we're told and get away with it."</p> <p>"I know what you mean. Like, they're on the side against me, so it isn't like I had any choice in the matter. And now I need a lot of it from them now. And I really don't want to be the one with the money. But this way they got a chance to kill each other and no one else would think twice. They could do it and they would kill. They must've done it anyway and they would've known what we were going to do. We'd have a problem not being able to think straight."</p> <p>She just sat there staring at me. "You're right. I don't understand. I'm so grateful for everything they've done to me. But I don't know if we can even survive without them. I'm the only person in this world with people who were very nice."</p> <p>"Honey, I can't imagine being that nice to you," I added, "I just don't want a heart attack and I'm willing to do anything for you to keep our family safe."</p> <p>"Honey, if you think what they did was as much about me as it was about you, you should have some idea how you feel. Just like they want to kill each other without bothering with money."</p> <p>I went on to tell her how much I was grateful for the help they gave to me and how they didn't care what other people thought. I told her how much it would mean to them if they didn't have to live with us and that she was right. But it sounded as though we should have just said things that we were going to do anyway. I also told her how much I appreciated the things she had done. She was right to worry about the kids. And she was right when she said she just hoped I wouldn't think things differently. And that was exactly how it was going to be. We could end up doing it with them right now; I could be in total control. That didn't make us any less guilty about killing them than it did before.</p> <p>As I spoke her eyes grew misty looking at me. She reached out a hand to me, "Come with me," she said and put a soft kiss on my cheek and said, "and have breakfast."</p> <p>I got up too and followed her and the kids. They were already scrambling eggs, bacon, scrambled eggs, scrambled cheese stuffs and they had a bunch of fresh vegetables and several containers of fruit from a store. We didn't go far at all in keeping them occupied with food butâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
