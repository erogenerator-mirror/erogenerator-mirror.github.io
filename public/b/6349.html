I started to run my fingers through my hair as I looked at the scene in front of me. A number of times I heard the faint sound of a key in the lock as I opened the door. I heard my key enter the foyer as I looked at the image in the mirror. The image was my fantasy. There was no doubt that the vision in the mirror was a real woman with her hand caressing her breasts. The image stood out clearly in front of me. Her face was gorgeous. Her features were a little shorter than the picture. She was the picture of a beautiful young woman. I could see the curve of her breast as if the outline of her nipple pointed to the ceiling.</p> <p>Her hair was loose and her hair style was perfect. Her lips were soft and inviting. As I looked at her eyes I could see the sparkle in the light reflected in her eyes. Her eyes made me think of the first times we'd had sex while we were still together.</p> <p>My hand trembled as I reached for the remote that was attached to the belt on my robe. If I had been holding the remote to my pussy I'd have been masturbating furiously. I dropped to my knees and quickly pulled my robe up. When I reached for the remote to turn the television on the robe fell open. If it had been a screen it would have flashed on just before I dropped to my knees and leaned forward to pull her robe closed. When I heard the screen change I saw that the image from the picture was not only in the room; it was being recorded by several cameras within one of the hotel's offices. The camera focused on my eyes as I focused on her face. There was just enough light and for me to see right through her robe. I glanced in her eyes to see the look of lust and hunger in her eyes. I slowly turned the vibrator on and looked through my fingers at the image before my. There is a soft moaning emanating from that spot which seemed to tell me all about her. I heard her gasp and the sound of the bedside lamp turned on.</p> <p>My fingers slid between my thigh as the image in the mirror was becoming more and more graphic. I could just barely make out the sound of my robe and panties being slowly pulled apart. I started to move toward her as the image of my tongue moved from licking pussy to tasting her pussy. The image in the mirror was coming from the back as if by its own accord. As I got closer I could see the faint outline of my hand under her robe. I could actually see where my fingers were just resting on the flesh of my breast. In time with the images on the television it wasn't long enough to feel the flesh of breast itself that was being caressed and squeezed by my fingers.</p> <p>The words "Take the robe off" flashed through my mind even as the image in the mirror was now just a blur that I couldn't focus on. "Take it off" flashed through my mind even as those words made it seem unreal. The image in the mirror flashed back to my mind as if in a dream. I could sense just a tingle as I imagined pulling my robe off of her face. I reached for the remote control and turned the television off. I closed my eyes and focused on the image of her in the mirror. I closed my eyes again as I relived the image of my hand as I squeezed my hard nipple between my fingers. I could feel the heat of my pussy and as I stroked my nipple I felt the familiar tremors that always start between my legs as my mind raced ahead to another vision of the image.</p> <p>Her voice was just as sexy as the image she was sharing with me. I felt as if I was in one of those stories where her words said the truth.</p> <p>I could hear the sounds in the room now that the image in the mirror was in full definition as her voice. I heard her voice again... "That's it. That's it... Take your robe off."</p> <p>I felt a familiar tingling of excitement as I reached for the remote control. I was about to turn it off and look at her as I tried to see through her robe. I saw the shape of her tits through the robe as I felt my nipples swell and harden as pleasure flashed across my mind through my body. I saw it in her eyes as her hand gripped the elastic of her terry-cloth robe. I saw it as she lifted the robe over her face... "Take off your robe." her voice now spoke into my mind as she spoke.</p> <p>What would happen now? Would she just walk away again... Would she slap me? Would she just say "Get the fuck out" or something else. I closed my eyes and envisioned the image taking shape behind the picture in the mirror.
