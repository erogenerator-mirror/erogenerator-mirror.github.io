However after what she had done, well the next thing you know, we went to dinner and afterwards we watched a game. That was not anything you'd expect from a couple who are "just friends". She seemed to be having some fun. I could tell by the look on her face as she talked, and the way she acted and talked with him that the way things were going between them would just have to change.</p> <p>It was the morning of their next date, a little before seven. I awoke before she did and thought I would get something to eat before going to bed. The next thing I knew I was lying on my bed in bed wearing some of her clothes. I looked to the side of the bed but could see them still. They were together again. Now.</p> <p>Now I lay there and thought about what had just happened and to what just happened. I was torn and I started to get all excited thinking about it but then I felt another stirring, it was her. She had changed. No longer was she shy. She began to flirt with him.</p> <p>I don't know what has gotten into me but this had to be something more. The combination of my thoughts coupled with her flirting had already caused what had seemed to me to be a major event. I had seen her at the office in various outfits. All I could think about was what she had been wearing that day. What she had done that day. They had spent the entire day fucking. It was all so surreal with one way or another but it all turned me on.</p> <p>She had come across him when they were out dancing. The song she had chosen was "Sleeping." It was a beautiful song. So different then the other songs I had been with. It was more like "Baby." She got out some very colorful perfume. It smelled like roses. It was intoxicating. She started to take his arm, she put it on her breast. He pulled it back in a hug and they began to dance. I was sure they had been playing some more. I think they probably did that. It had been a few years since they had done that.</p> <p>I was feeling very guilty by that point and I was just watching them dance. I tried to get myself under control but something was tugging at me. I wanted to help them with it but I knew it would be more than that. I tried to just let things play themselves out, but I did not know that it could be that easy of an event. I figured if it was just a one-time thing they might go for it, that it would just never happen again.</p> <p>I tried to stop what I was thinking. I tried to stop myself from becoming aroused. But to no avail as it was just too much. I think I had already decided for this situation that I was willing to take this trip again. And if this happened again, then I would definitely need to come up with some sort of a plan. I could almost think about what we could do from there. "Would she be interested?" Well, I didn't know. What would she think if I asked? "What kind of chances do the two of us have?" she had said in a little joke. I just looked at her a little nervously and was wondering if I was that way too.</p> <p>She seemed to smile at me and said, "You are just a little excited, aren't you? Go on" and then she placed his hand around her waist. I stood there and watched. They stood there for a while. Then he moved his hand around to her breast. I can't explain the feeling that I had as he began to caress her nipple with his thumb and first finger. "It is that good to have you in my arms again?" she asked me as she looked at me with that sexy smile on her face.</p> <p>"Well......" she began to say but I cut her off and took her in my arms. She wrapped her arms around my neck and kissed me on the lips and kissed me back and then she looked me in the eyes and asked me what I thought of what she had done. I couldn't say anything. The other thing that hit me, she had actually said "fuck" and it was to ask if I wanted to have sex with her again. I felt like I had betrayed my wife once again.</p> <p>She smiled at me and just stared at me. "It didn't even start you know," she said as she put a finger to my lips. "You are not a man but you feel the same way. You are just a man. Don't worry your head. I promise it will be good for both of us in the long run!" I almost laughed but that would have to wait a little while.</p> <p>She kissed me again and then they walked out the door together.
