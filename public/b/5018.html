He took her in his arms, kissed the side of her neck, pulled her close, and whispered words to her as if she wasn't there. His mouth was hot on the side of her neck and his tongue moved down to stroke her earlobe, and a shudder of sensation ran though his body, a strong desire to fuck the woman he was about to marry.</p> <p>When they returned to the house, they spent most of the afternoon playing with each other. They finished a glass of wine while they went to take another shower. He sat on her sofa, leaned back and enjoyed the softness of her skin on his, while she snuggled against him, her hair spilling over his arm, and his lips pressed against the side of her neck.</p> <p>"Now." She whispered and put a finger to the tiny button that just held the panties on.</p> <p>A thrill hit his body. She leaned back against the sofa, her body completely exposed to his eyes, and he slid his hand further down between their bodies. She moved it slowly against his hardness and closed her eyes.</p> <p>His fingers wrapped around hers and he rubbed her clit. It didn't take long for her to begin to push herself against him, and when he slid one finger inside her. It was a gasp in his throat and he let his lips move slowly over hers. She pulled him tighter against her.</p> <p>He put more pressure on the pressure in her hip and slowly began to work a second finger inside her. One hand kneading her ass while the other found its way around in her hair. Their movements moved with each other: sliding around, teasing the sensitive flesh, then coming back to the same rhythm.</p> <p>He could feel her growing harder against his hand and began to move his hand in circles just inside her. She leaned closer and took his head in her hands, and her soft cries could be heard over the rumbling house. She broke the kiss again and pulled his hand away.</p> <p>She stood up and took a step towards him, pulling him down the hallway. He stood as she wrapped herself around him, pulling them up the stairs, the coolness of the wood under them, and kissing him.</p> <p>"Thank you so much for the wonderful evening. I couldn't have done it without you." He smiled as she bent down to kiss him one more time, but this time she had a firm grip with her hands that kept him against her.</p> <p>She didn't want to give him a chance to think about the evening any longer, though. When he felt her fingers slide down between his legs and touch his hardness, he pushed her away.</p> <p>"Are you sure you're okay with this?"</p> <p>"I'm fine with it. I know we're in a really good spot and..."</p> <p>He slid an arm around her waist and pulled her back against him once again, this time with the head of his cock pushing inside her, "I'm not ready to have sex without doing this. It was wonderful, and so much more than just having sex with you."</p> <p>For a moment, his mind wandered. She was still wrapped around him, clinging to him, as if they were forever. He could see the passion and desire and the love inside her body and knew that this would be the best night of their lives. As he felt her relax against him and she began to gently rock her back against him, he reached down between their bodies to find her clit.</p> <p>"What are you doing?"</p> <p>"I'm making love to you."</p> <p>He didn't press his body against hers, but pulled her against his body. Her body fit so snug and perfect against him, he knew it wouldn't take much to make them both cum. He pulled her body against his and felt her muscles tighten around his hardness.</p> <p>He slid his fingers slowly inside her, and then moved them again as if he were giving one of her a ride. Her head fell back against him as he began to thrust against her again with his fingers, knowing that it would feel different on his own. She reached down to grip his hair and pulled his face to hers.</p> <p>"Oh baby, my husband loves my pussy, doesn't he?"</p> <p>His hips started to move as he moved his body slowly against hers, and suddenly he heard her scream, which sent him in that familiar place of pure pleasure that only came out of lovemaking. The way her hips began to move against his thrusting cock brought out another moan into his mouth. As he felt her tighten under him before he heard her scream again, he knew that he had to have her. He pulled her hips hard against himself, grinding his cock harder against her clit.</p> <p>There was something that reminded him of what they had seen that first time they made loveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
