I think I said a long, long yes. I got in the car, took a few deep breaths and started driving.</p> <p>When I pulled into the parking garage, I had no idea how to go about it. The first thing out of my mouth was: "Do girls have the car?" I asked. They looked at each other and back to me, in disbelief.</p> <p>"Yes, it's a new model," one of them said. A third one went with a raised eyebrow; it didn't take long at all to agree, and get the word out.</p> <p>"That's a pretty good start, huh?" I asked.</p> <p>"It looks great," Karen said. She and the other girl exchanged a knowing glance.</p> <p>"Where'd you get it?" I asked.</p> <p>"I found it the night that I found you," she said.</p> <p>"We really needed girls to know how to drive on a schoolgirl's drive," I joked.</p> <p>"Honey, you're a grown woman now. I'm 18," she said, taking a step closer to me.</p> <p>"You're in love, too," she said with a smile.</p> <p>"You're crazy," I retorted.</p> <p>"You know I am, don't you?" she said, leaning in to kiss me. Her lips were soft and moist. I could smell her body. She had on a pink summer dress that had her in a halter. It was sleeveless, and fell mid-thigh. It had high cut legs, almost to her pussy. It hugged her curves. You could see her nipples poking through the thin top. The front had ridden up a few inches, and her chest was pushed up in a teasing manner by the thin material.</p> <p>When she put her arms around me, she said, "Oh, you are so handsome looking," and planted a sweet, warm kiss.</p> <p>All I could say was, "You've got to be kidding!"</p> <p>"No, it's real," she said. "It's very sexy."</p> <p>She backed me up against the wall, then put her lips on my ear, whispering, "It's true," right before kissing my neck and nibbling on my earlobe. As she did so, her right hand slowly moved down my chest until it rested on my belt. She was squeezing my cock through my jeans, and it wasn't long at all before I could feel it straining against the fabric.</p> <p>"You have a nice cock," she said into my ear. I could feel her tongue swirling around in my ear until it turned into a little suck. She slid her hand up to the zipper button and undid it. I took a deep breath and leaned back into her. She slid the zipper down, then undid the top three and put her hands into the front pockets of my jeans to pull them down. The skirt fell to the floor, revealing her panties. That's when she put her hands on the tops of my thighs and lifted me. I leaned back and said, "Not yet," in a soft voice and slid my hands up over her thighs until I found her panties. Her hands were now under mine, her back arched as she leaned forward and pushed my cock into the middle of my waistband.</p> <p>"I love your cock," she said with a soft, sexy smile.</p> <p>She let go of my cock and lifted my hips until she had to hold onto my legs. When I moved my hips forward, she turned me around and sat me on the counter. She slipped her panties off and threw them over her shoulder as I spread my legs and moved forward. Her panties were white, barely covered her pussy, and I was able to see the little strip of pink hair that ran into the base of her mound. I moved slightly closer to her, and she reached towards my face. I reached out, taking her hands in mine.</p> <p>She put her fingers on my lips, pressing them against mine, and said, "Do you want to taste me right now?"</p> <p>"Yes," I managed, trying to sound as sexy as I dared.</p> <p>"That's what I like with girls at all," Karen said. She put her hands on my thighs again, and guided me to where she wanted me. She took hold of my cock in her hand, and moved her other hand to the inside of my left thigh. She got to my balls and began to stroke them slowly, causing my cock to get a little harder. One of her hands then began to play with the hair around my cock, while her other hand ran up and down the shaft up and downâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
