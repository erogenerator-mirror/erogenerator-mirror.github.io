"I am sure there is someone for you, but don't worry, I won't be the only one."</p> <p>She could feel her pussy getting wetter, and her breathing deeper now as she felt her own lust rising along with it. She closed her eyes and sighed as the thought of his cock pressing against her, filling her, stretching her and sliding in to her. She felt an almost burning sensation, like the heat and wetness of a woman's flesh. He was larger than she had ever thought possible. This was the sort of thing that she wanted to do, and she knew that she would enjoy it, too.</p> <p>"Yes baby, please," she breathed in his ear. "Just for you."</p> <p>"Oh God, yes, sweetie," she replied, and kissed his cheek lightly. "I'll be right there with you. Now take your cock out for me."</p> <p>Slowly and carefully, he pulled back his shaft from her. The cool liquid feeling made her body flinch, but she didn't move away as she watched, fascinated. He was a lot bigger than most guys she'd been with before, and his body, so smooth and strong, yet firm and powerful, made her shiver with want. And there was something so sexy and thrilling about watching his face as he pushed himself fully up inside her. Slowly he stopped, and she felt his cock pressing into her, his balls pressing against her. She squeezed her thighs against her own groin, pushing harder against the soft satin sheets and satin sheets.</p> <p>"Yes baby, don't rush, I love it," he said, reaching up to caress her face.</p> <p>"I love it too, honey," she said, pushing her body back against him, her clit rubbing against his balls. "God your cock feels so good."</p> <p>He pulled himself out of her and then slowly pushed himself back in. She clenched her muscles, trying to contain the desire building inside her, and couldn't believe how amazing it was feeling. She could feel her pussy lips stretching and rubbing against every ridge of his shaft. She bit her lip as she held herself open, feeling him so deep inside her. She could feel her orgasm rising to new heights as he took it deeper, and she felt him pressing against her cervix, his cock bumping her clit, making her cunt burn and tingle. She didn't know quite how much more she could take, but her body couldn't stop wanting more. Her head was still on the pillow but she was moaning almost constantly now, and she looked as though she could hear the sound of his balls swinging in midair, slapping against her clit, making wet slapping noises and making her body shudder. And it felt so good. God he was so thick too, and his cock was so warm in her. She pressed up hard on her nipples and felt that delicious tingly pleasure coursing through her body. She was on fire, and needed that release.</p> <p>"Oh God," she said, suddenly feeling a hand on her shoulder, turning her toward her. He was still fucking her, but his thrusting was no match against her inner pussy muscles, so tight she could never be satisfied. "Please, fuck me again, honey," she whimpered, looking up to him through a cloud of lust. "Please, fuck me. Harder."</p> <p>A smile crept across his face and she felt his hands caressing her face, stroking her cheeks, her forehead. She could see the pleasure on his face and knew he had a beautiful lustful look in his eyes, and she wanted to see it. She wanted him to be fucking her so hard it hurt. She didn't care about it at all. She needed to feel him inside her again and again, so bad.</p> <p>He pulled himself back out and then pushed himself back in, holding himself still in her wet sheath. He could feel her cunt juices running down her thighs, dripping into her ass hole, coating his shaft of his cock.</p> <p>"Oh yes baby, yes," she said, opening herself fully towards him. "Take it, take it all in."</p> <p>He grabbed his cock and pressed it straight up against her, causing her to gasp. He was thick and very long, she remembered that she had been told, and it felt so good. Like an out of body experience. She felt totally used up, but she didn't care, the feelings were so good.</p> <p>"Do you want me to do that to you?" he asked.</p> <p>"Oh yes please," she repliedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
