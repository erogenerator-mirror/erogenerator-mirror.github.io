But we were alone. I was about to move her towards me, my cock twitching and twitching as each thrust of her body took an inch closer. My mouth watered at the thought of being buried between those big brown hills.</p> <p>I was on a very emotional roller coaster as I watched my girlfriend fuck another girl for the first time. She had taken a bit of pride in herself too. She had fucked at least 5 girls with her big dick. And then came one of the hottest girls when I was home for Christmas.</p> <p>"Oh God, that feels so fucking good!" She moaned, her hand guiding her hips as I slid my dick into her pussy from behind.</p> <p>I looked at where she was and felt my balls tighten as if a rope was ready to blow my load off. She looked back at me and smiled, her tits jiggling with each slow thrust of my dick.</p> <p>There was so much going on in that trailer with me watching. I felt the heat and the wetness as her body took a huge thrust and she screamed something I couldn't understand.</p> <p>She threw her head back and grabbed her tits with both hands and rode the dick that had just been fucking her pussy senseless. I could feel her hot body as it slammed her. I heard her voice as she screamed, "Oh GOD!"</p> <p>Her hips jerked and thrust as her legs wrapped around me and she drove her pussy down to the root. I felt the warmth on my shaft as her body shook under me.</p> <p>"Oh fuck! Oh fuck! Oh God!" She screamed as she held me close, never allowing my dick to leave her hot wet cunt.</p> <p>After she came, she turned and leaned against my chest and kissed me on the neck as the orgasm wracked her body. Her head lay on my shoulder, her breath hot against me.</p> <p>"Was that hot?" She said, turning her head to kiss me, holding my head against her breast.</p> <p>I thought I would like her to give me a massage but she kissed me instead.</p> <p>"I would like you to do that thing with your finger again but we'll make it really memorable for you."</p> <p>Her hand touched mine as she held me.</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>I nodded. "Yes."</p> <p>She smiled. "We'll just have to see."</p> <p>She lifted herself off my cock and smiled back at me.</p> <p>"That thing got you started this way," She winked at me and we kissed.</p> <p>I smiled back at her. 'I think we're ready to take the next big step.'</p> <p>After we parted, I looked down at the scene between my girlfriend's thighs. Her thighs were spread wide and I could see her drenched pussy with my cockhead hovering just below her slit. Her pussy lips were pulled open with her fingers. The swollen lips looked so tight I could see the moisture coating them.</p> <p>"You said you'd get me started." She said.</p> <p>"You're already fucking me, aren't you?" I teased.</p> <p>I nodded. It didn't take much more to get her off but I had a plan.</p> <p>"I want to feel it too." I confessed.</p> <p>She hesitated for a few seconds before lifting herself again.</p> <p>"I feel like I'm ready to fuck again..." Her voice was tinged with a little apprehension. I knew then it would be nice if I tried to bring my finger into play too.</p> <p>"You know I would like to." I said and nodded.</p> <p>"But there are some things you have to be nice about." She smiled. "I think it would help if you were nice about it. Okay?"</p> <p>I nodded my head.</p> <p>"No, no." She said. "I'd rather feel like I'm comfortable around you. That's what I mean by it, right?"</p> <p>"You could be anything you want. I mean, I can't tell you how you could feel like this in front of me."</p> <p>"No silly. I like to be good and I like to fuck." She smiled. "Besides, you know I'm okay with it." She added.</p> <p>I laughed.</p> <p>"No, seriously I can't tell you how long this makes me. Maybe 5 seconds, maybe 10 minutes maybe five seconds."</p> <p>"Ok." She smiled. "Now I'll do my best to please you."</p> <p>I leaned forward, taking her nipple in my mouth.</p> <p>"Mmmm," She cooed. "You like that? You like that?"</p> <p>"Ugghhh." I moaned. "It's great." I moaned again.</p> <p>"I'm going to really enjoyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
