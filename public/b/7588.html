It looks like I'm a bit on the ragged edge."</p> <p>"Why don't you go get on with getting a drink?"</p> <p>"What? I've already had this?"</p> <p>"Yes, you really have. I've never had it before, so I'm going to sit here and relax. You go into the other room and have a drink and have a good time."</p> <p>"Yes Ma'am."</p> <p>He stood up and stretched. "I think I need to stretch more."</p> <p>"There you go." She said, then reached out with her foot and picked up a few cans of lager. Picking one up, she handed one to Kyle.</p> <p>"Here. The same for me. I think I could use this. And you'd like some more."</p> <p>"OK. That would be nice."</p> <p>Kyle sat down and leaned over the back of sofa in front of her. She took a sip of the liquid then sat back.</p> <p>"That's the drink you're going to use, but I don't need it, I've had this before."</p> <p>He poured three glasses and handed one to her. "To the rest of the week." He said.</p> <p>"Thank you," and he kissed her.</p> <p>He started taking his glasses off and she began to feel the alcohol making her legs wobbly.</p> <p>"I can't take it much more."</p> <p>She sat up, then took a drink.</p> <p>"Don't go. I'm tired. I can't do anything else."</p> <p>"Sure. Go make yourself comfortable."</p> <p>"Okay. I can't go, I need to at least take a shower."</p> <p>"The shower's nice. Take a nice long hot shower and do your thing. I'll see you back on the sofa."</p> <p>Kyle got up and left while she took a quick shower. She didn't look back when she was done.</p> <p>After an hour, she felt it was nearing midnight. She took a drink of the coffee and walked to her bedroom. She was just getting out of the bath and she noticed a note on the table, "Carry on." It read. Then she walked up behind the man who was sitting on the sofa and reached around him.</p> <p>"Hello again, handsome."</p> <p>"Hi beautiful. How are you and you're husband doing?"</p> <p>"Oh, he's in Japan."</p> <p>"Yes ... I have other obligations there. I think we need some time alone."</p> <p>"That's lovely."</p> <p>She reached out and grabbed his waistband and pulled him towards her. He gave her a kiss, then helped her up. They sat around the table and talked. She asked him about work. He was on a tour of Japan and she wanted him to tell her a bit about his work there. It was nice to take his time.</p> <p>"We are having a party there on Saturday. We have some friends that want to come to see our house."</p> <p>"Sounds interesting. Are they coming?"</p> <p>"I think so."</p> <p>"I'm surprised they aren't coming. I hope I won't be disappointed."</p> <p>"The party is fun."</p> <p>"Thank you. It was wonderful talking to you this weekend. I can't thank you enough."</p> <p>"You're welcome, I'm having a great time too."</p> <p>They finished their coffee and went back into the room. Kyle went to the bathroom again. She sat on the sofa and he joined her there. They began to talk, he found out lots about her.</p> <p>"So ... I'm going to ask you some questions if I don't have your answers."</p> <p>"Sure." She replied. "I'm not exactly sure what to do right now, besides that."</p> <p>"That's okay."</p> <p>"I've had this thought a couple of times ... a few months back. It's going to be nice if I'm not too anxious to do it."</p> <p>She was starting to feel a little overwhelmed. Maybe he was right. Maybe she should not be in such a mess, but she didn't need to feel guilty.</p> <p>"So what are you thinking right now?"</p> <p>"A lot. When you're doing something, sometimes you don't have to think about it or else ... well ... maybe it's okay. It's fun. I can't explain it. What was the answer?"</p> <p>"My question ... when it comes to our relationship ... yes ... it's definitely a lot to take in. Just a few questions."</p> <p>"Go ahead."</p> <p>She sat there takingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
