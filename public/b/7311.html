I saw my husband look up in amazement at me standing there with the most mischievous grin on his face.</p> <p>"Is this the end of the day?" he said.</p> <p>"I was thinking more like the start of the next day, I guess." I replied, stepping back slightly. "My turn next then."</p> <p>The other man in the room watched me very closely as I turned my back around, and leaned over against the counter. I felt his eyes on my shapely cheeks, and it was all too easy to see the shape of my small breasts.</p> <p>"Here, she's ready, I got me some breakfast for two," the first man said grinning.</p> <p>"That's better, thanks," I said to my husband and then walked over to him. He looked up and smiled at me and then turned to go to the breakfast cart where I had arranged a cart so he could pick up the eggs and grits. I didn't want to let him out of my sight but I hoped my husband didn't see me walk back to him. What a sight, I thought. My husband was a handsome young man and he looked a good ten years younger than the fifty-three years that my husband had left him eight years before on the business.</p> <p>"I think I'm going to get breakfast then?" I said to him happily.</p> <p>"Yeah, this way we can meet at the station for breakfast and then we can go shopping," he said. He grabbed a napkin from the side table so I could wipe them off and he walked towards the line of cars where the first car to pick picked up eggs and grits. While waiting they drove through the line of cars leaving the empty chairs. The cart to our left was a little lower than our house level so I had my husband's attention; I took a couple of steps to stand before them and leaned over the counter to pick up half a dozen eggs and a couple that I'd picked up from the line. The first guy in line asked for bread so I took and he said, "That's very good."</p> <p>It was strange, feeling a little weird and a little excited, being the girl of the couple who was not only going shopping but a little strange watching my husband while he was looking. His eyes were on me almost every time I passed up that line and he got into a conversation about who it might be that he wanted and what I might want, when he saw a couple of more chairs that there were empty. One chair had a young male in it. I saw him eyeing me up a little then looking up at me as I walked towards him. He noticed that I was walking back slightly and he was looking up at me when I leaned in to make sure I was really close to him. I knew he could see my breasts and it made me feel a little naughty as it was obvious I was deliberately giving my blouse open and exposing my hard nipples. He just stared at me a little longer then I could hide myself behind the counter until another car was waiting to pick up that was about forty feet away. I knew that my skirt was not going to hide the fact I was bent over, and that my bare feet were on the other car. When the next car pulled up I smiled and he grinned back. I heard a couple of guys start the car and look a little embarrassed at seeing him looking, a moment later, up at me I saw the man with a shocked look on his face and he said, "Oh my god, I just caught him looking."</p> <p>"Sorry I couldn't help myself from taking a look," I said, "He looks a little like he is about my size next to you. Are you sure there's no one in the line?"</p> <p>"No, there's a ways to the right that were a bit higher," he replied. He knew the guy in the line was going to be a bit surprised, but he was also pretty sure that his face was in sight of me when he started back out of the line. The next car pulled up a little after me. I said to him, "Well we should wait a little while before picking up breakfast, I guess."</p> <p>The third car pulled to a stop in front of us. Another one pulled up. I turned and looked at him and said, "What?" He was looking down at my skirt and then looked at me again. I felt a little embarrassed looking at him, and didn't want this moment to be the end of the day at all. He turned and started walking towards us. "Thanks," I said happily. "Let's not let anyone else take a chance that they might say that it was you I picked up."</p> <p>We wentâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
