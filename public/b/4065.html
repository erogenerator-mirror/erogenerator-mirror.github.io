I asked. "She's still in the office. She should be in there on Tuesday. This is about keeping the baby."</p> <p>"Yes but you're probably right on."</p> <p>"I just... I guess she's not going to be the one calling us from the office," I mused out loud. I couldn't believe that a girl, who was my daughter, had somehow told someone to have sex.</p> <p>"You're sure going to ask her?"</p> <p>"Yeah. I hope it's her. I don't want her to get upset."</p> <p>"Don't worry about it at all," he said. "You can tell her anytime."</p> <p>"It's not that, Daddy." I was worried. I had never gone as far as calling him daddy, especially in our private conversation. I hoped he wouldn't think I was nuts.</p> <p>"It's not that." He had stopped moving, but remained motionless as he looked at me again. I looked at him, not quite believing what I was seeing. "I have to go but I'll call you tomorrow," he said, standing up and walking away.</p> <p>I couldn't go home without seeing this man again and I didn't know why I was so worried. I had made quite a mess on my bed that morning and it had been filled with sexual fluids. I had made love to my son's daughter. It had been wonderful.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Chapter Three: The Night Before.</p> <p>I had no idea what time it would be. I was still too groggy from all that wine to make any plans. I called my doctor after school on Monday. He called right down the phone and told me he would be late leaving in a few hours. He told me he was coming over early so he could get me some answers. I told him I would probably be asleep when he got here but that I would be awake by the time he got home.</p> <p>I showered that night with some of his favorite bath gel, shaved, styled my hair, and put on a short dress that fell about mid-thigh. I applied some baby oil to my hair and went to bed wearing his favorite blue teddy over my panties. I lay in bed for a few hours, enjoying the feeling of soft, warm wetness between my legs. I closed my eyes and imagined his mouth on my naked body. I would love it to be there.</p> <p>I was very surprised when I heard his vehicle pull up in the driveway. He came in and I smiled and waved at him as I came. He came into the living room and sat down in a large arm chair next to me. I could see his eyes following the curves of my body as they entered the room. They lingered for a minute on my breasts as I walked by him. "Where's mom?" I said in a slightly nervous voice.</p> <p>"Going to sit down," he said, standing and dropping his robe. His erection was long and hard pointing straight up towards my stomach. It looked as big as my son's before he went in the house. I tried to imagine how it would feel to have his cock inside me while he sat in his chair and I closed my eyes picturing myself as I had imagined him.</p> <p>He sat beside me on the couch, his leg against the back. His cock was pressed against the outside of the fabric and I could see it starting to rise. I wanted him so bad right in front of my face. "It's time you fucked me," I told him.</p> <p>I knew he was shocked but his expression didn't change. He leaned across me and started kissing me softly at first, then more deeply. Then he broke away and got up. He pulled me up, turned me around, and lifted my dress over my shoulders. I felt him get up and his weight on me as he sat on the couch. I felt his erection press against my ass and his hands slide over my body. I squirmed when his hand cupped my breast and he gently squeezed. I opened my eyes to watch him as he pulled at my stiff nipple with his thumb and forefinger.</p> <p>He turned his head to look down at me as he leaned over and kissed my neck and collar just below my collarbone. I felt his tongue lick over my skin and he made his way to my breast. He took a nipple between his lips, gently rolled it before giving it a lick, and he was rewarded with a gasp as it hardened. He continued his downward trek over my belly until he had reached my thong. He pulled it down and off me as I lifted my hips. He continued lower and I felt his wet tongue on the underside of my pubic hair.</p> <p>Then his tongue started lower again and his lips brushed my skinâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
