One of the couches was occupied by a naked, naked woman, a gorgeous, very pretty blonde. I was still not sure what I would do with her. I could just stand there and ask her to leave. But if it was the wife, I wanted to just turn her head and kiss her. And I wanted to kiss her again.</p> <p>I pulled her to me, pulled off my shirt, and slid my shorts off. I ran my hands down her back and over her ass, grabbed a handful of her hair and pulled her closer to the edge of the couch. I began to kiss her neck, moving slowly down on her skin, moving towards her breasts, making those nipples tighten with every second. I took them in my palm and began to squeeze them, and she gasped and closed her eyes, as if she was in ecstasy, which she was.</p> <p>I slipped my hand down her pants and panties, and began to run my fingers over the outside, while kissing her neck. She was already wet, just from that quick, sweet exchange of skin-to-skin contact. But I rubbed her clit and she moaned, and I moved on top of her to find her wet. I rubbed myself against her while we kissed, feeling her body and scent, my arms wrapped around her, my hair between us.</p> <p>She started to moan, still not breaking our kiss, and I looked up at her, and she was looking right back at me, not blinking an eye. I slid my tongue between her lips, and kissed her with everything I had, while I felt her legs wrap around my hips and her hands pull me closer as we ground against each other. Our bodies were slick with a combination of sweat we both needed. She moaned and kissed me harder, harder still, my mouth open and her tongue sliding and teasing between my teeth.</p> <p>I knew what she wanted, but I wanted to tease her first. I had been on my toes with the wife for a bit, but I knew she wouldn't be ready for that and I wondered how I could take those thoughts from her head. She must have been in her own hell as I continued my slow grind. I could see the excitement in her eyes as she stared my eyes at mine.</p> <p>With her eyes closed, she moaned, as I started to rub myself against her pussy. She was obviously enjoying this. Our passion built as we ground against each other. She had to be. I kept rubbing myself against her while continuing to kiss her. Every time I did it, she gasped a little from the intense pleasure running through her body. I could tell by the look in her eyes that she was ready to come.</p> <p>"I want this."</p> <p>I nodded. "What?"</p> <p>She looked at me questioningly. "Want this?"</p> <p>I nodded again. "What?"</p> <p>"Tell Me."</p> <p>"Say it."</p> <p>She smiled at me. "You want this?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>She smiled at me a little louder. "Then say it, baby. Say it."</p> <p>I nodded again, still in the same position.</p> <p>"Say it, baby. That's it."</p> <p>She closed her eyes and smiled. "Say it, honey. Take my hand, say it."</p> <p>"Take my hand."</p> <p>She didn't hesitate. "Take my hand."</p> <p>"Say it again."</p> <p>"Take my hand."</p> <p>She didn't wait for my answer. She looked at me like she might die. I think she thought I wanted this. I think I could tell by her look that she did.</p> <p>With a bit of a shrug, she let go of mine and reached for my hand. "Say it."</p> <p>"Take my hand."</p> <p>"Say it back!"</p> <p>"Take my hand."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>I didn't know what to do.</p> <p>"Take my hand."</p> <p>I was lost. It was so simple. But now, this wasn't going to be a fun weekend. I was afraid someone might hear us, that I might lose her, and that this might ruin everything. She didn't need to know that I wanted it, that I wanted to be inside her, just so she could feel this with me, just so she could feel me as I touched her.</p> <p>"Say it."</p> <p>She looked at me, as though waiting for an answer. I looked at her, feeling an inner surge of power, an undeniable urge of lust, a desire that I didn't think existed anywhere in the world. I nodded once, as though waiting for acknowledgement of that.</p> <p>"Take my hand."</p> <p>"Yesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
