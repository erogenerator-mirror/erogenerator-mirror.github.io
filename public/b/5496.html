She pulled me to her lips and kissed me. We remained still for a while, me with her breasts pressing against my chest and me, my hands on her breasts, feeling, squeezing, gently kneading, kneading, squeezing again, squeezing and pulling her boobs.</p> <p>"Yes, dear, just like that," I heard her whisper.</p> <p>I moved my hands downward. I was careful to avoid touching her pussy. I didn't want to give her any ideas about what sort of things to do to her pussy. She pulled me back to her mouth, our kiss more urgent, more demanding as our kisses became more passionate. She ran her fingers through my hair.</p> <p>When she broke her kiss I asked, "Do you want the other one? You know, so you can be sure you don't get a hard-on? You should feel a big one and you should take care of it when you play with yourself. It isn't as comfortable as it once was."</p> <p>"Nonsense, dear," she said, "you don't need to worry about that. Besides, you're going to feel it very soon if you play with yourself too!"</p> <p>It was true. I had, a couple of times, and actually got a hard-on. She was right. I hadn't realized it at first, but I probably would have done it, if I didn't have such a strong urge to get an erection myself. But she seemed so concerned about it, so concerned that she didn't even realize it. She seemed so happy about how I felt about the other women in our life, not about me.</p> <p>"You know," she said, "when I was young, I didn't need to wear clothes when I was with my parents. You know," she continued, "my parents did the same thing with my clothes. I have to be careful if anything goes between us."</p> <p>I said, "I know." Then I said, "I have to tell you something," and I quickly reached up toward her, put my hand on her left breast and squeezed it gently.</p> <p>"You can say anything to me, right," she said, as if she intended to make my job easier.</p> <p>"I can't tell you anything," I said. "I have to, anyway."</p> <p>I squeezed her nipple again.</p> <p>"There is something else I want you to do," she continued with a sad smile on her face. "You can tell me anything."</p> <p>"I love you," I said, as if it was my own answer.</p> <p>"And I love you," she replied. And now her smile got even more sad.</p> <p>"And I love you," she added, her smile still more sad.</p> <p>"We can play with each other some more, you know," I continued.</p> <p>Her smile widened. "I'd like that, dear," she said, "but I don't know why I should. I've never been with a man before. There's someone else I'd like to be with tonight. Besides, I don't want either of us to get an erection."</p> <p>"Why, dear, I know what you mean, but I don't want either of you to get an erection. I can assure you that there's nothing wrong if we just sit around all night, just doing what we always do, and trying to get each other off."</p> <p>"I don't want to!" she said, "I don't want to give you an erection,"</p> <p>"I'm sorry, dear," she said, putting her arms around me. "This is my first time for real sex. I've never done it before. I don't have anyone to do it with."</p> <p>Then she looked down and said, "Please don't be mad, dear. I haven't really done much, but I've heard that some women like it when a man takes charge, and I've been on the receiving end of more than the usual men who come from other couples. That should be expected."</p> <p>I was surprised at the suggestion of our own husband. And how a simple question like "Why would you want to fuck someone?" would endear her with the notion of doing a man, but not us, but him himself, too.</p> <p>"I think you'll want that a lot more than a man."</p> <p>"I know," she said. "Well, I'm not sure about that yet, but I'm sure you'll enjoy what we can do."</p> <p>She had a point of fact. I got her bra off and put one arm round her while we resumed kissing. It gave me a sort of opportunity to have a look at her tits.
