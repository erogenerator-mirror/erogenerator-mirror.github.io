I'm good with that. I think I have a good looking bush and I can't take my eyes off." said Jason. "So what do we call this, the 'whiskey in the ass'?"</p> <p>They had talked about these as they had talked about the threesome on a few occasions. Now that Jason was paying attention to her body she couldn't stop thinking that it was his pussy in her ass and Jason had to be in her pussy again, that his cock was in her ass as he had made her cum over and over again in the bar. She looked at him and gave him a little smile, then moved off the couch and straddled the cock she held in front of her. She had no intentions of letting the cock slide in the tight hole of her ass. But as soon as it was in she had a mind numbing orgasm and let the cock slid easily in and out of her ass. She let the hard, throbbing cock go from in front of her face until she could just see Jason.</p> <p>"I do like your cock. It's so hot. I've done it a few times." She said. She took Jason's cock in her hand and started to stroke it. He began to pump his body up and down as she went up and down over his cock. She moved her hands from his balls down to her pussy where she began to finger her clit which made another series of orgasms start to build until she could take no more. She got up with her arms outstretched over Jason's stomach and slowly slid the cock between her luscious, round ass cheeks then down onto Jason's cock. She continued to slowly stroke Jason's cock with her ass while it disappeared completely into her asshole. She had just begun to feel Jason's cock going in and out into her ass when she felt her orgasm rip through her body. It seemed to go on and on and on and when it finally ended she rolled to the side as Jason was quickly pulled from her and onto his back. She rolled over in the same position as Jason, then rolled back over against him.</p> <p>"That was hot," she said. "Now I just had to make you cum. We can just do it like we did with my body. You can fuck me. That's right." She said.</p> <p>"That's just fine with me." Jason said.</p> <p>"I thought you wanted me to say what you wanted to hear," she said.</p> <p>"I did," said Jason. "But I still have a hard time thinking about other things. You said you had a hard time thinking about what Jason did. I should have said something or made that other thing more important." He said. He began to kiss her and she didn't seem to mind at all. He began to work his way down her throat and into her chest.</p> <p>"Oh Jason," she said when she felt him at her nipple. "I can feel your tongue circling my nipple. I wish you could move all over me. But since I want you to, I'm going to ride you for as long as I want to, then I'm going to make you cum again with my body."</p> <p>"I do have to think about this. I need to keep working the bar. If you know about the bar, maybe I'd like to go there and get some lunch if you have some lunch there also." said Jason, grinning.</p> <p>"I think you can handle the bar." said Jennifer. "By the way, how do you know where we're going? It's not that long or difficult."</p> <p>"I just know." Jason said with a smile. "We should try to find a spot where we know of a good place where we can start at. There is one in the back if you want."</p> <p>"You're right. The guys we had at the bar know where it is. I think I'd like to go there in one of the spots where there are empty and we're surrounded by tables." she said, sounding genuinely happy with the idea that Jason had a plan with which to help her.</p> <p>She laid a piece of paper across the back of the bar and asked Jason to pull up a stool and get a towel. The bar itself was in back as they took their drinks to the other side. Jason opened a couple of beers and began to open the beer. In the back was a row of small tables. There was one table at the end of the room that was covered with a green fabric cloth. The row behind the row of table was directly facing Jason and Jennifer. She told Jason to sit down at that table and she would lead the way down the hallway to the restrooms.
