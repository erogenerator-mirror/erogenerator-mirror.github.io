For the last six days I have been in agony. I'm so happy. Please don't go too far with this."</p> <p>I paused for a moment. I could see that she wasn't sure why I stopped talking about it but if she wasn't sure why I went on about it I couldn't tell her my intentions by now. I decided to put an end to the conversation by talking to her. "Look, I know you're just trying to get to understand that and I don't want to lead you on, but, I really don't want to have to tell you that you have to live with the fact that you and I have been together for a little longer than you expected to have. I'll just have to go on with my life, as you will. But, for now, if you just want to wait a little bit I'm all for it and I will understand.</p> <p>"Thank you for not having to do this, for making my life better."</p> <p>"You're quite welcome." She said as she reached out and took my hand. Then she pulled me toward her as we started walking toward her apartment complex. Once inside she looked at me and I looked at her questioningly.</p> <p>"Yes, your friends are going to be home on Sunday and that won't happen anytime soon, Will." She kissed me on the cheek and we quickly began moving toward her door.</p> <p>"Thank you. I should probably thank you for letting me stay with you while you were gone."</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I'm sure Will could tell you that."</p> <p>"Will, are you ever sorry?" She asked me as she took my hand. We had just turned the corner off her walk and she was once again smiling as the words left her mouth.</p> <p>"No. I'm just a bit surprised that you did, and thank you for it."</p> <p></p> <p>My neighbor was in a hurry to get back to her apartment and when she walked back to her home on Sunday I said, "Well?"</p> <p>"Will." She looked at me expectantly and I shook my head. I smiled at her and she gave me a big smile and a hug.</p> <p>I thought to myself, "What am I doing here?"</p> <p>Monday, May 14</p> <p>All through work my mind was racing as I tried to figure out what was really happening. I also thought about how I thought of my daughter and me and my feelings about him. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that I was becoming quite turned on and, more than it already was, and that I wanted to do that thing with my daughter.</p> <p>I didn't know how I was going to take this and I certainly didn't plan to. It seemed like the very first step, but my mind wasn't doing me a favor.</p> <p>I had been feeling guilty about not giving my daughter his baby right there and then, and I wasn't sure about not letting him have it when we had first started talking about it. I never told Will that he had to give her the gift she deserved and I never told him that anything as trivial as making love to my daughter came up. I never said she had to get pregnant or anything. I did have the best feelings for her, and I didn't want to change my life for her, but the fact that he could be my first and only lover didn't seem a good idea.</p> <p>I was in a deep funk. I didn't find it at all reassuring that my daughter, my lover, the love of my life, was happy with me. I didn't talk back to her. I didn't even think about it. I just stared at the screen and tried to get myself together.</p> <p>Monday, May 14</p> <p>All day I was thinking about how badly I wanted to make love to my daughter, and how badly I had to do it. The whole time I was going over everything in my head I was thinking, "What if I didn't want to? What if I could be there to help?" I was going crazy and what the hell is there to do? What if I couldn't be there?</p> <p>When I got home on Monday I stopped in at the bank and then got home to see how things were. That's when I saw my daughter sitting there, looking in the mirror and smiling as she was talking to another woman at the same time.</p> <p>"What's so funny sweetie?" I asked.</p> <p>"I don't know." She said in a much quieter voice. "I can't get over the feeling that Will is being with her. I know he is going to have to give her up or he will have to leave."</p> <p>I was stunned but the feelings in my heart were so incredible and I was so relieved. "What the hell is going on and what the fuck are you doingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
