He looked as if he could make any statement at all in his current situation. And how had he met her in the first place? I was sure something like the night he'd come to take me home made that even better. We'd been together for seven weeks, and I hadn't even seen her for several days. But then I thought about it...and my cock began to stiffen.</p> <p>"You mean, you...just kissed her?" I managed to say. He turned slightly to look at me, his face serious as he stared. "I mean...it wasn't just a quick kiss was it."</p> <p>"Not just a quick kiss." I laughed. "But more and more often. I mean it was a nice peck, and a nice little peck, and her tongue didn't even flinch." I laughed, "And...I think you have an idea what we've been up to!"</p> <p>He stood up, taking me in his arms and kissing me harder than ever before.</p> <p>I let him. I had no intention of backing down. I wanted him again. As he held me close, I pushed away from the door to get my things together and open the door to the bar, leaving him standing at the door. He took me by the hand, helping me back to my seat.</p> <p>"I don't know what got into me!" I said, pulling him into my arms and kissing him again. My lips had a taste of cum on them, it was a pleasant taste, and the heady smell of sex that was in the air added to the atmosphere of the club.</p> <p>And then I suddenly realized, she wouldn't be back there until ten, ten-minutes after I had left. I looked at him, and realized if he didn't kiss me right then, what he did would be done, and I couldn't resist it.</p> <p>"And you kissed everyone else, didn't you?" I laughed as though I had done that a thousand times. He nodded, and said, "Yeah, you kissed other men and you even ate them." I knew he was lying.</p> <p>"And I told you, it was like I had a choice in the selection." I smiled and kissed him. "But I'm not lying." I leaned in and kissed his chin. "You kissed another woman last night."</p> <p>His hand was on my thigh, slowly sliding up and over my dress. He was already moving to my lips, and I responded, pushing my tongue between his lips and into him as he did it. My hands moved to his shoulders as he leaned over and kissed me again, slowly pressing his hard cock against my thigh.</p> <p>I slid my hands under his t-shirt, feeling his well-defined chest, and felt his heart pounding as well. He was so soft, and it was hard to resist him. We kissed some more, and I felt his hand slide down my shirt and stroke me through the lace of my bra, and then lower. I pushed my hip towards him, pushing myself up against it and sliding my tongue deeper into his mouth as he did it.</p> <p>His arms encircled my neck and pulled me into him as he began to kiss me with a fury that could only be called lust, and I could feel my own passion rising inside. My body was on fire, and I was afraid he might break the kiss, and I wanted that to be the moment he would lose himself in passion with me.</p> <p>As he kissed and sucked my tongue and lips, I pressed myself onto him, my legs parting for him. My hands fumbled into his pants, feeling the smooth hard cock growing in his pants as he helped me get them off. I unbuttoned his shirt slowly.</p> <p>I wanted him all day. I wanted sex with him again. I wanted to feel him inside me. It was the first time I had seen his erect cock before. He looked at me like I was a new girl just looking at him, and I wanted him to make love to me again.</p> <p>I ran my hands all over his chest and chest, my fingertips gliding over his soft, muscular chest as he stood there. I felt his hardness press against my thigh, and as I bent down to kiss his nipples, he slid his hand into my bra strap and slowly pulled it down, freeing one breast.</p> <p>"You're a great kisser, you know?" I said, kissing and licking that nipple I'd kissed and licked. "But just for a kiss, I'd love to do it again."</p> <p>He smiled, and leaned over to take my nipple into his mouth. I leaned back against the door, my arms wrapped around his neck as he sucked and licked on my breast.
