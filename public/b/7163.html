It's nothing more than a sincere statement," she said.</p> <p>I looked down and saw a large wet spot on my pants. "I don't know where this might be. Can I take this for what it is?"</p> <p>"I don't think so. I don't think that's what's going on with you and Tim, is it? I think if I was married to someone that he'd just take anything that I said if I were married to a guy, wouldn't a man be that way?"</p> <p>"No, I wouldn't."</p> <p>It took a little time before her tone got back to my usual self for me to realize that she was right. "Oh, yes, it is exactly what I would, baby. Now go and tell Tim to have a cuddle."</p> <p>"Sure, honey," I replied to her.</p> <p>I knew my parents would never understand, but I was sure her words were true regardless. Once I got there, our eyes locked. "Honey, are you sure you're okay with this?"</p> <p>She didn't answer. She just put her hand to her mouth and looked down.</p> <p>I was shocked, but a smile crept onto my face and I put my arm around her waist. "What's wrong, baby?" I asked.</p> <p>"This is so stupid," she said.</p> <p>"Me too. Here with you and not Tim," I added.</p> <p>When I went outside she grabbed my hand and looked down into my palm. "Baby, I'm so sorry."</p> <p>"I know, baby, but I love you."</p> <p>The moment her eyes left mine she gave me a big smile. "Okay, baby," she said. "I'm still not totally comfortable with this. I still want us to have a long relationship. I don't want to have to do this."</p> <p>"I know, and neither are you. I love you, and you have nothing at the moment to lose or to gain. Just go with whatever it is, if it comes to that."</p> <p>She looked up into my eyes and for the first time I saw hope and happiness in her eyes. It made me feel like a king.</p> <p>"I feel the same, sweetheart. I love being with you. I love doing this... and all the things that I've thought about... but I...,"</p> <p>Again, her lips touched mine. It was just like her first time; a soft gentle kiss. I could feel her tongue probing at my lips. It's strange, but it felt so strange at the same time. The whole process had seemed so natural, but I'm sure we couldn't be apart. I really did feel like a king that night.</p> <p>I felt her hand slowly creeping downward my chest, but she never touched my nipple. I felt incredibly horny. It felt so wrong that she could do this but she knew that I couldn't tell anyone. She kissed my neck gently and I couldn't tell if she was teasing me or if she was really making love to me.</p> <p>"I want to feel you. Please do this. I need to feel you."</p> <p>She looked up at me, her eyes pleading, and again, I felt the same way. "I'll do anything. Anything you want. Anything you want," she added.</p> <p>She kissed my lips and the sensation was absolutely electric. This is so wrong, but I couldn't think of another way to break the ice that I needed to get through. It just felt right. "I want you to make love to me, honey. I still can't believe how lucky I am. Your father is such a good lover. What more do you want than to make love to me."</p> <p>"I'm not sure I can do that, baby," I replied.</p> <p>"Don't worry," she soothed. "Just give it your best, sweetie. Please make love to me." She reached her hand up and stroked my chest. I felt the soft texture of her finger tips rubbing over my nipples. I was getting worked up again. I kissed her lips, slowly and sweetly. Our lips met gently, but we both knew that we had to wait to see if it would be as much of a shock to us as it was to us the first time. We knew we needed to make it special.</p> <p>Our kiss was soft and loving. It was as if a new friendship had been formed. She reached for the button on my jeans. "I can't wait any longer," she whispered while rubbing more, "Please."</p> <p>I felt a surge of pride in how I acted that first time. I felt that she was sincere in her desire for me to tell her how I felt. I was just going to have to wait until laterâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
