I was busy with my lunch, and I wasn't paying much attention, trying to ignore how the day was going. I thought about the way it had gone from just a little over a week ago, to being a week ago every week, when we had been fucking like rabbits. It reminded me of our first time together, the way her body responded to every thrust into her and every thrust out. The way those breasts, their fullness and plumpness, bounced under mine every time I slammed into her. I could never remember having anything better.</p> <p>As it played out in my mind, my arousal grew. My breath came in ragged gasps. I started to imagine how good it would feel, and I knew I wouldn't last long. I was going to cum soon, if I stayed still long enough. I bit my cheek and fought to keep from cumming too soon. I was desperate to do as I was told, but it seemed like a good thing to go on. I guess for some reason I just thought of that as a chance to get me past.</p> <p>"You can't finish. Not your job," I managed to say. Her hand tightened around the base of my cock.</p> <p>"What? I think he likes it rough." I heard her laugh quietly.</p> <p>"I think you like it rough."</p> <p>"Uh-uh. No. I don't like it rough ... rough."</p> <p>"I know you don't," Katie cooed, tightening her hand around my cock even more with mine there. I felt the weight of our bodies move forward and back, and I could feel her body tremble and tremble as she moved her hands up and down my shaft. I could feel the heat of her breath on my cheek, but my mind was clouded by lust and desire.</p> <p>She kept the hand running up and down my cock, rubbing its head against the underside of my shaft as I moved my hips back and forth. A bead of precum had formed on a tiny drop. She squeezed the head of my cock slowly, but still with enough force that it made a small squelching noise. "Mmm, I could try," she murmured, smiling broadly. "Can I have a little taste of that tongue?" She looked down at me, eyes locked with mine, before moving once again up to my face. "Maybe you're ready to cum now," she purred.</p> <p>I nodded slowly. "All day."</p> <p>"It would make me happy. It would make it harder to do," she teased, her voice almost inaudible.</p> <p>"I don't care. Make me cum, Katie," I said, unable to deny an erection. "I like your tongue."</p> <p>"And your lips," Katie said, her hips moving against mine. "Your fingers . . . there's something I'd like us to do." She let go of my cock, freeing it, her body now shaking slightly at how wet she was. It took all the control I had not to just shove my tongue into her, but I'd stopped trying to keep to myself.</p> <p>We were all caught up in the moment. I was on my knees on the floor by this point. I had the strength to support my upper body, yet I was in danger of falling down again. I looked over as Katie started to turn over on all fours. I couldn't bear to watch her naked ass wiggle around beneath a layer of material she had just put on.</p> <p>I couldn't keep my hands off my cock. But what could I do? I should just move on to what's mine. I knew Katie was probably watching us anyway. If she found out, she might stop us. Even if she did it would be worth it, I thought, looking back at her, holding the tip of my cock in one hand, stroking softly now that both hands would be free to move the rest of the way around. Even if she wanted me, she couldn't let me make her cum. I couldn't do that. A smile formed on my lips. "Can I lick you," I asked, my mind focused on the taste of her pussy lips.</p> <p>"All of it, I promise," she said, as if she had said that only a hundred times in her life. Then she leaned over and opened the button on her shorts, easing her shorts and panties down to her ankles. "You can kiss now if you want," she said, pulling them off, the wetness visible between her legs.</p> <p>I was stunned. This was it. I got to watch her, lick her, feel her skin on my lips. I knew this was it. I couldn't do the things I thought I had done to her, but I didn't care anymore. I just wanted to watch her whileâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
