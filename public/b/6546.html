"The water will be cold."</p> <p>"Then can I use your shower or do you have any clothes on?"</p> <p>"Do you have anything?" asked Tom.</p> <p>"No," replied Sarah in a very serious tone, "But I thought I had some water. It might help keep out the cold down there."</p> <p>"I think we'll have enough for the hot tub, thanks," Tom said as he got up to go on his way.</p> <p>"If you can get some towels in the bedroom, I'm all yours," Sarah said. "It'll be easier if you are there next time."</p> <p>"What are you talking about?" he demanded.</p> <p>"Just a moment, Tom, let me change right here in the bathroom. I don't have any more clothes!" Sarah quickly said.</p> <p>Tom quickly pulled on his shorts and buttoned them up just as Sarah stepped out into the room.</p> <p>"Come on, you," she said as she bent to put her sandals on. "Let's go."</p> <p>Tom had just moved out of the shower in the hot tub with a large towel around his waist as Sarah turned off the water, climbed into the tub with him and began to slowly undress.</p> <p>Sarah and Tom stared at each other for a few seconds before Sarah got up out of the tub and stood over and put the towel and soap on his towel and began to wash it off. He looked down at her with a question on his face like where she could get his eyes while he still had an erection.</p> <p>Sarah got down to her knees and began to get dressed.</p> <p>"Is it too late for me?" Tom asked.</p> <p>"No, that's cool. Besides, with you in here, it might do you some good." Sarah said as she picked her clothes up off the bed. "You just wear those shorts, I'll keep you warm."</p> <p>After she took off her top, Tom said, "This is the first time I have seen you without anything on."</p> <p>"Don't you want to see more of me?" she responded.</p> <p>"Are you sure you can cope with me?" Tom responded as he shook his head.</p> <p>"Of course I don't. That's part of the fun." She answered as she climbed out of the hot tub. "I'm on my way back to the room now. Try and not spill a drop, alright? Just don't think you get to see a lot of me in person."</p> <p>Tom's eyes lit up that Sarah was going to come into the living room and that he didn't have much money to be able to keep what Sarah was offering him. He was going to give her a good night's sleep with a nice nice fuck.</p> <p>Sarah got up out of the water on her wobbly legs and stepped on her sandals and made for the living room. She looked up as Tom entered the room.</p> <p>"Well, are you coming or not?" she asked.</p> <p>"Of course I am. Are we going too?</p> <p>No! Of course not!" Sarah replied. "But remember, I'm on my way to the kitchen."</p> <p>"You going to stay and watch TV?"</p> <p>"No. I'm getting something out of the fridge. Something from my day's supply of beer."</p> <p>Tom watched over Sarah as she walked out. He liked how she looked in her tight shorts. Her bare midriff was taut and very firm. He could see her erect nipples pointing from beneath her thin tank top.</p> <p>"OK," Sarah said as she bent over to kiss Tom on the cheek, "Just let me get some stuff out of the fridge and I'll get another beer. There'll never be anyone coming down that way tonight."</p> <p>With that, Sarah dropped the shorts from her waist and dropped her bikini bottoms in the front garden out of sight. Tom was almost tempted to go and watch as Sarah walked back into the living room and she quickly bent over the armchair and quickly took a couple glasses of wine out of the refrigerator.</p> <p>"Now," she said as she sat down on Tom's lap to take the bottles, "let's put our feet in a pool."</p> <p>"There's nothing in my fridge," Tom said with a laugh.</p> <p>As soon as they were in the pool, Sarah went straight to Tom's cock in his bathing suit before sliding on his legs under the water. She began to kiss Tom's neck as she moved to a reclining position and leaned back on his chest. Tom knew he wouldn't be much of a swimmer when Sarah started slowly bobbing her head up and down to take more of his large cock into her mouth.</p> <p>"Damn!" Tom said with a laugh.
