I laughed. "The only thing better at this point is when you give a blow job."</p> <p>"Silly," she joked, moving to the top of his desk. "I don't have the energy anymore."</p> <p>"Good for you," I said, taking a bit more room. He wasn't looking like he'd be able to take his entire body without cumming. "What are you getting to work with, anyway?" I asked, pulling to a stop at the end of his desk.</p> <p>"How about the usual?" he replied. "This guy?"</p> <p>"Yeah," I answered with a wink. I then proceeded to start my usual work. I made sure to make sure he finished before anyone else did. Then I told him to take the blindfold off. He did just that, and after placing the small square device between his eyes for him, I moved to the table top.</p> <p>"There," I said, taking my position between my best friends. "Okay, let's see what you've missed."</p> <p>I looked up and saw that there were quite a lot of couples already in the room. One guy came in the next and left with a couple of other guys who seemed to be in a rush to take him up on his offer. I was in the final row of guys who'd completed their tasks and the girl was waiting for them by the time they'd finished their lunch. I looked the closest and thought that he was an eye opener and the girl could do with a bit of eye candy with her quick wit and smile. The girl was holding the blindfold in place by the corner of her full-coverage eyes.</p> <p>"Is the guy up?" I asked her. "He's the one who's on the edge, but you've got to give him a moment to get off. Can the girl do with him the rest of the time?" she whispered.</p> <p>I was about to say something else when the girl whispered back with a sly smile as if she was having trouble with the blindfold. I saw her eyes flash in the reflection of the other guys as they'd already passed in their work. "I think I can make that happen," I said. She gave a half smile that could have melted a glacier. She was probably waiting for someone she might have had a fight with before with a couple of the rest of them. She was the only person left in the room who had the upper hand, and if that was what it took to make her give in. Maybe if I gave her an hour of entertainment, I could beat the guy or the girl. Just as the last guy was walking out of the next building, the girl was on her knees giving him a very wet blow job from behind.</p> <p>I made a brief mental note of what she was doing while I did my job. I had no idea whether she could possibly put the blindfold on herself, but there were some good ideas. I did my best to distract her from the work that she needed to do to complete her job. A half dozen guys had finished and the girl had started her back stroke. I knew it wouldn't take long to bring him off, and I just hoped he would finish in a good way.</p> <p>I heard her moaning and I felt my cock begin to harden as I wondered which of my friends this woman in front of me was. I didn't care either. I heard her moans start a bit louder, and she started to move from her back to her front, almost whispering to my face the first time. I felt the urge to follow suit with her and let her have her own fun.</p> <p>I wanted to know what her husband was thinking about that, so I looked over to him and looked him straight in the eye. "He hasn't finished yet, and no one's really gonna be able to do it," I told him to bring himself back for me. He did, and after giving me my turn at the same time, I watched as he stood up and moved towards her chest. She grabbed his ass with both hands to pull him in as he came up to her chin.</p> <p>"What do you want?" I asked.</p> <p>"Come here," she said to him. He came closer, and I waited for her to give him what he'd been looking for. I saw her look at the crowd of young men who were now standing around her. They stared at me with expectant eyes as she looked back into his face. If he wanted her to suck his cock and cum on his face, then she was going to have to do a damned good job.</p> <p>I saw the girl grab the base of his cock and begin to lower herself to just the tip before she started lowering. As she went down, she held the head on her tongue and I saw him smile for her. I saw her smile back and a look ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
