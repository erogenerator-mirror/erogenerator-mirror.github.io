The first thing that made any sense was the doorbell. The second was the shock of the bell, which made me smile. I opened the door, not sure if it was a friend or a business associate who was calling.</p> <p>I found her sitting on the couch, with a large glass of water. There was an air of familiarity about the house and a deep sense of confidence as she sat as though she was part of something special. She held her glass close to her mouth to quell the buzz she was feeling. The smell of the glass overwhelmed my senses. I was still feeling somewhat overwhelmed from the experience of coming in, but not much by accident.</p> <p>"So, did I pass the test I was hoping to do in college?" I asked.</p> <p>She laughed, "You passed. You know I have no idea which one we are going to see. I am still not sure on how to tell you. Now I have a question on how I should feel. I am not sure on how best to tell you," she said.</p> <p>"I could ask you the same. But please tell me this," I said. I moved closer to her. I tried to look at her face so only she could see me in the darkness, but felt the warmth of her in the room.</p> <p>I began, "I really liked what happened back there with Steve." She looked over at me and then down at her glass. She tilted her head to the side, staring the glass out the window at the distant traffic, which was slowing far enough away from the house.</p> <p>She nodded, "Yes, it was something I enjoyed every second of," we continued to talk. "And I did not regret it, not at all. Steve and I have been on our own for the last three years. It has been wonderful.</p> <p>Just after graduation we moved to the city. But it is our first time here, as much as it is for Steve."</p> <p>She smiled back and we continued to talk. Suddenly she said, "So this is how you are planning to spend your first night here? Going to a hotel?" She smiled.</p> <p>"Let's say with one evening," I said.</p> <p>"Oh," she said, "What brings you here on the whole week? I am so glad,"</p> <p>"I just came from college a long time ago. If I did not know it better I would have known that you had been in contact with the other people that are in the building. I have never seen you this happy."</p> <p>"I am so sorry. I hope it doesn't happen again," she said,</p> <p>"It does not, at least not for long," I said.</p> <p>She smiled. "Why are you here?" she asked.</p> <p>"Because I had a little time to myself and decided it had to end. It was important to get to know you and Steve. But as I said, I have not seen you in a long time. But the last time I saw you I had a chance to say hello very carefully. Just like that I knew exactly who your wife was. I think I was not the only one that saw her on the second floor. You made an impression. You were a very pretty little man. And if I were not with you I am sure that the two of you would be kissing."</p> <p>I could not believe I had a chance that I was holding the conversation where the person that I was with in the room with me did not have to hear what I was saying. I could not believe that I had the nerve and honesty to tell her about my past relationships, even knowing it at the time. I could not believe I would have had a chance to do the same.</p> <p>And if I had thought back to that night I would have understood and even encouraged her to go through with our plans to make our first night at her house special. But even though I had gotten used to the idea of not having an actual date for our first night there, in the darkness of my home, no matter how romantic the night would be, I still was not prepared for this next part. Now that I had mentioned it to my wife it seemed as though I had made the best choice of her life.</p> <p>"So I guess you knew who I would be spending the first night with?" I asked.</p> <p>She smiled. "Steve was not a good choice."</p> <p>I smiled back. "I didn't know that at the time," I said. "But I still don't want to get into a rut, so after dinner we can just do what is needed here. For all we know we might be on a date."</p> <p>"I guess you're right," she said. She looked over at my head at the ceiling.
