OH GOD NO!" I moan almost in agony as I feel him pulling out and leaving it's warmth all inside of me. He leans down closer to me. I bite his lips. He grabs my hair and drags my head over his cock. I feel my face and neck flush but soon I feel something else and want it so bad. I'm being driven like a wild animal, like a fucking animal all around me. I'm being driven crazy by it.</p> <p>"Ohhhhh God!!!" I yell out as his cock hits my g-spot. I'm having my cunt fucked by my boyfriend.</p> <p>I feel all of me being drawn in to him. His body over mine. I think I will go crazy, I mean, I can't cum. I'll be dead. I will pass out or die. I scream in agony through clinched teeth. I want it. I know it as long as I give in. But I know it isn't over yet. I just need more. I beg him to cum inside of me.</p> <p>My orgasm never starts. Oh, how does he have to tease me like that? Or maybe he gets to see all of me. Oh God, I'll never feel any of that again, if he just makes me cum again with him. I think he's about to pass out in me now but he knows how. He starts fucking me again.</p> <p>"Honey...wait a sec..." he moans softly. "You know how to eat a girl if you know what I mean." he says as he moves his lips down to my neck. I feel one of his teeth bite into my flesh.</p> <p>"OHHH HUHHHHH!!!" I scream out.</p> <p>He stops suddenly and just pulls out. I turn to see what he has been up to. He must have just cum, with the lights out. I must have been really out of it. I feel his cum dribble out of me and down my legs. I wonder how wet and messy it would be. I'm too excited to feel any of it.</p> <p>I move over his body so I can lean over him like a cat. I start rubbing his chest and nipples.</p> <p>He leans up to look at my face. I look down at his throbbing cock. It's almost purple and red. He has one hand at my ass. I moan loudly as I feel something.</p> <p>"Ohhhh!!!" I cry out feeling him inside of me. It's so wet. I feel his warm juices running down the crack to my ass. He leans down and kisses my lips. I'm completely open to him.</p> <p>He's fucking me into oblivion; inside and out. I feel his hands going to my body. They come to my breasts. He starts pinching and pulling my nipples. He moves down kissing and sucking my neck on my left while his right hand rubs and squeezes my ass. My body reacts and jolts with each little touch. I moan and writhe beneath him. I feel my cunt being stroked and then the coolness of his hand.</p> <p>"OOHHHHH!!" "OHHHH!!!" I cry out as he starts rubbing.</p> <p>"Yes...right down there!" He slaps my ass hard. This has really hurt me. I try to sit up a little so it goes easier.</p> <p>"OOOOHHHH GODDDDDDDDDDD!!!" I scream out again.</p> <p>He moves to my face again. He kisses my lips deeply and then moves down to my neck. He whispers in my ear. I hear him taking long deep breaths. He continues massaging my pussy. I know what's coming. I feel it.</p> <p>"OHHH...YEEESSSSS!!!" I shout as I start cumming. I feel him start to throb and start to pump his cream into me. He doesn't pull out. In fact, he takes it all inside. It fills me up. I hear his heavy breathing; my own. Then I feel his hard cock deep inside of me again. It's throbbing deep inside of me with the rhythm I feel. This time I'm not so tense and still ready.</p> <p>"Oh God, my man," I say in a whisper.</p> <p>He starts to push all of it in. I try to move but he doesn't move. I start to cum just a little bit harder now. We move all around, our bodies moving in harmony under his. He looks down and watches as I move under him.</p> <p>I see his balls start contracting and his cock pumping into my cervix. He pulls out and pushes into me. With each stroke all that's left inside me are his cum. There are no other movements other than our individual bodies. He fucks me with quick steady strokes. My pussy is being rocked by him.</p> <p>"OOâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
