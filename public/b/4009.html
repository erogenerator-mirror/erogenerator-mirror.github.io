And I love it when you call me that. Will you fuck me now, James? Make me beg for it."</p> <p>He smiled and held her tight as they finished up.</p> <p>“That was so good. Did you have anything planned, sweetie?"</p> <p>"No. Just me having some fun with you. I want more of my things with you," She laughed. "How does that sound?"</p> <p>They kissed and laughed and kissed and kissed again, their bodies becoming more active. She was on top of him and she rode him in a steady rhythm as he kissed her hair. She reached into the night stand drawer and withdrew a condom. With a mischievous look in her eye she opened the container and gently poured it onto his cock. She then leaned forward and pushed her breasts firmly against his back and moved her lips to his ear.</p> <p>”I love you.”</p> <p>”I Love you too.” He kissed her ear and she moved her mouth down to gently lick the tip before pushing her tongue out to taste him. She repeated the kiss and again leaned forward to tease his cock as she slowly moved back to kiss his mouth. She moved her lips slowly down his neck and down, sucking gently, until she got to his nipples. The first time he touched himself, she knew he was getting close, so she took his nipple into her mouth and sucked on the hardened nub. She let the nipple go and moved her mouth over to suck on the other one. He was close, so she moved down his body to his cock and took the head into her mouth. She moved it up and down in a circular motion while licking his shaft from the tip to the head and back again. Her tongue flicked the tip of his cock as she let it out of her mouth slightly before she took his head into her mouth. She ran her tongue up and down the sides and on the slit. When he felt her tongue slide back down his pole, he leaned into her mouth more but not too much, as he liked to move in and out of her mouth. She took more of his cock into her mouth and he felt it hit the back of her throat and then slide down his shaft to the very tip. She stroked his entire length with her mouth as he held it in place, holding it there and feeling it press against her tonsils. He didn't need any encouragement this time as he gently pulled her face down onto his cock. He felt her tongue move around his cock as she moved her head up and down along the sides and under his head. She held his cock deep as she bobbed up and down. She began to increase the pace and was surprised at how fast she was going. Her tongue was moving quicker, as was the saliva wetting his cock. Her mouth was hot as it slid over his length, the heat of the moment bringing more and more blood into it. He pushed his dick all the way down her throat. She moved her hand back to his butt and played with his balls as she moved her hand in the opposite direction. She felt his cock slip back and forth in her throat as his hand moved to her shoulder to hold her there while she pushed herself up and down his cock faster and faster. It didn't take long before his hand was on the back of her head and she had to pull him out from her mouth and back out again to maintain the movement he was creating.</p> <p>”Oh God, that's so good.”</p> <p>He started to move his cock from her mouth and then slid it down to her pussy.</p> <p>”James, that feels fantastic. You know how I love it when you fuck me doggy style.” She looked over her shoulder to him and whispered.</p> <p>“Oh God, are you sure?”</p> <p>“It feels absolutely fabulous. I love you so much.” He kissed her cheek and she reached behind him to her drawer for more of his cock. ”Here, hold it for me.”</p> <p>She took his cock in both hands and guided it slowly down into her pussy before pulling it out to replace her hand. She pushed back against him and looked up at him.</p> <p>“Put it in real slow."</p> <p>He slid it in easily, as he continued to watch her, she moved her hips up and down. With the first stroke, she started rubbing her clit, as he continued to fuck her pussy in rhythm. She was so wet that he slid in again and he slid right in. They both could feel the heat of their bodies and the wetness between her thighs. He took his time at first, slowly and carefully. He saw her begin to breath faster and—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
