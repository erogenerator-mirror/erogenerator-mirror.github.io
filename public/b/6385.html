I wanted to feel that. I wanted to feel that all the time. She was too beautiful and I just liked what she was feeling. We made love for hours, like that. I don't know when we finished but she had cum again. And again. I never left for days like that, as I made her so happy each time. But, eventually, she fell asleep and I knew I could take it any day I wanted to. We still were together for all my days. And I would never leave her.</p> <p>* * * * * * * *</p> <p></p> <p>It was almost three months after my honeymoon and my wife had been away on a business trip, leaving that month for Europe. I was just waiting for the last plane to stop. I was about to take off when this strange figure came up to me. I froze, and looked up. It was my old friend, my late husband. He was looking at me, as if he could read my mind. The last thing I wanted to do was to be upset, even though that was exactly what happened. I felt like such a silly and dumb man, and I was going to leave this place without saying a word about what had happened in our marriage.</p> <p>"Hello." I said.</p> <p>"Hello," he returned, smiling, knowing I wanted to talk with him.</p> <p>"I need to leave." I said firmly.</p> <p>"Sure," he replied.</p> <p>"Don't." I said.</p> <p>He smiled. "You're leaving, aren't you?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"But the last few days have gone by, haven't they? I don't want your life to get ruined and that's not my business." He said. He smiled again.</p> <p>"Yes, it has." I said. "I told you before that. I won't be leaving. Not again. I love you," I said. He looked at me with a puzzled expression on his face. I guess he wasn't happy in his job that I was leaving there without him. Or to be honest, I had only been a few days away from it. I was so happy. And suddenly I felt a tangle of emotions starting in my guts and I wasn't sure that I wanted it to stop.</p> <p>We stood up and the two of us walked to where our rooms were. I locked my door and he went back to his hotel. I was a married woman with two children, a husband and a wife. I was his first lover and I wanted it to be a good first impression, just once. We took off our clothes and lay naked in each other's arms. Neither of us spoke.</p> <p>He rolled over and kissed me. I felt his cock against my stomach through our clothes and I put my hands around his back and pulled him toward me, feeling his cock pressing up against me. I felt his hands on my breasts, as he explored their fullness, kneading them roughly. I could feel his cock getting harder and harder and as he fondled me I was beginning to feel the pleasure of another orgasm coming. I had to get out of here immediately! I started taking off my clothes. I stopped to remove my panties. I took them off and tossed them to the floor.</p> <p>"Are you ready for me?" he whispered.</p> <p>"Yes." I gasped as I was getting turned on again. "Fuck me!" I said.</p> <p>"What?" he asked.</p> <p>"Give me that cock of yours!" I answered.</p> <p>He walked over to me, put one knee on the bed then turned me to the side as I lay down. I was in his hands and I could feel his cock pressing into me. I wrapped my arms around him, pulling him onto me as he started pushing into me. My body was getting tired by now, as his cock was pounding away at me and I wrapped my legs around him, pulling him in harder.</p> <p>"That's it! Do it!" I said as he started really fucking me as if he was fucking me forever. I was so turned on and I started moaning "Oh God, do it!".</p> <p>"You're going to come, don't stop!" he said as he drove into me. He was hitting every part of me just right and I started to come again as he kept thrusting until we both finished. We lay in each other's arms feeling spent once more as the two came apart.</p> <p>We had gotten into each other's arms when suddenly I felt someone coming into my room. A female, or female, was standing at the edge of the bed. It was my new husband. He had a sheet tied off, but my underwear was still covering him. I turned to check if it was my lover from upstairs. He was naked.
