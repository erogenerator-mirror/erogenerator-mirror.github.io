She immediately started sucking and licked it the best she could, all the while, stroking the shaft with her hand. I leaned forward and wrapped my hands around her head and started playing with her long hair a little. My wife’s soft tongue wrapped around my cock like a silk glove.</p> <p>Her eyes closed as her body relaxed on top of me. As I moved my hands into her hair I pushed her face back toward me wanting her to take me all in. I wanted her face on my cock forever and I wanted to feel it fill her throat. I wanted to savor every second possible.</p> <p>My hands moved to her shoulders holding her as she started pushing and pushing her face back again to take me deep. Her mouth moved easily over me but I could feel her throat opening up to allow me in. She pushed it back until she hit the back of her throat and almost choked on the head of my dick. She kept pushing her face back to me wanting to taste more of me.</p> <p>She moved her hand up from her hair to rub her tits over my cock and then pulled it away quickly to push it back into her mouth. She kept my hips held to my face as she took me deep one more time.</p> <p>I let her suck me back in to her mouth, holding her mouth on my cock with one hand she moaned softly, "Oh my fucking god!"</p> <p>Her body slid back the rest of the way on top of me. Her legs were now over my shoulders just like she had held me up her ass. Her hips rocked against my crotch and she kissed me deeply. Her hand found her clit and my fingers came up to rub her as she fucked me back for more. She pushed her head back onto my chest and kissed me again harder. My body started to shake under her.</p> <p>I held her and played with her tits and nipples. The room was starting to spin now as her body was moving faster into me. Sweat was running down her face, body and legs as her orgasm rocked her body. I held her tighter, pinning her to me. Her hand was against my head, moving back and forth, back and forth against the tip of my cock as she squeezed me tightly.</p> <p>She screamed again just as it washed over her. I felt the tension in her body build and her body was moving all over my body. I felt her hands pulling at the hair under her, trying to push me back. I was the one trying to fuck her face and that is exactly what happened.</p> <p>Her hips jerked against me as my cock entered. She looked back at me, her eyes wide in surprise, her body convulsing as her orgasm hit her like a storm. She pulled my hips to her and I felt her juices running into me, wetting my thighs as well.</p> <p>I let her catch a breather while I rolled her onto her side. My hands gently caressed her shoulders as her breathing returned to normal. She looked at me and smiled, "I am glad that you were thinking of me."</p> <p>My mind was racing. "What?"</p> <p>"I need your cock inside me again—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
