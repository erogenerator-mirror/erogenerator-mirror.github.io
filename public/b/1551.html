I wanted a whole picture of myself that I thought about and took to be as real as I could. The idea that we were sharing a moment of real tenderness made me blush. I just shook my head and stood as he walked along the corridor away from me. I didn't care. I wanted to get away from this and just have what I had been missing this entire time.</p> <p>I went to shower and I knew I looked beautiful in a little white lace teddy. It was so little around the edges of the lace that if you were standing very close it looked as if it was coming off. I stepped into the water to see myself in all of it. I stood in front of the mirror in the dressing room mirror and looked at myself. I could feel myself turning to look at me.</p> <p>I pulled the teddy up and ran my hands over my body. It was like a slow sensuous massage where my hands and my fingers were in constant contact with my skin. I rubbed myself hard with my fingertips. The teddy had a split up one side that went to my hip, it barely covered my crotch and back to my thigh. The split at the side would stay on my thigh for a bit. I knew I'd have to go up the length of my thigh to my hip and over to the other side to where my fingers stopped. That's when I started to feel very sexy. I ran my fingers over my mound and I could feel I was wet. I knew that would be me when I came to him in the next few minutes. I'd look in the mirror and then run my fingers over my mound as I thought to myself, "I can show you it in the next few minutes. That's all you'll have, tonight." I rubbed my pussy hard as I walked to the dressing room. I wanted to look great tonight. I wanted to be dressed in a sexy way that wouldn't be obvious to those looking at me while I walked to him. For awhile I just looked at myself in the mirror and my whole body got so hot.</p> <p>After my shower I put on some new lingerie. It was the first one on the rack and I knew that if he went home he'd just take it off. My nipples were so hard, so tight, so pointy. It gave me so much feeling to play with them like that. I made myself a cup of tea and set the tray on the bench next to me. It was on the other side of the wall and I went behind the curtain at least twice a week to get my own tea. It was pretty common for me to go there, but I'd always wear my outfit and I hadn't had to do so much with any of them yet tonight, but I did my duty.</p> <p>I grabbed the tea tray and walked over to where the door was, I opened the door a crack. It was dimly lit but I could make out a shadow of the person inside, watching over the counter. "Did you enjoy yourself in front of that delivery guy today?" I asked him in a low voice. I knew that look well when I had it, he was enjoying himself more than I was.</p> <p>"I sure did, mom. I didn't know that it was coming to me. It was fun."</p> <p>"I know it, it was fun. There's no other man in my life who is as much fun in my life as you are. I hope we never get there in the middle of night or it will be over. Just remember that no men ever touch me."</p> <p>"Ok, I understand. I hope to hear you out later."</p> <p>"Yes, I promise to tell me what that means. I need someone inside me and I can't ask you to do anything you don't want it."</p> <p>I knew what I wanted. After watching him get my panties off, I wanted very much to see that huge dick in his pants. The thought of having a real dick up inside me filled me with a lusty thrill. I wanted him to see me like that.</p> <p>"Ok, I want to see what's in your shopping bag, and I want to know what it is."</p> <p>"Do you mean that?" I teased at him</p> <p>"Yes mom," he said.</p> <p>"Okay, if that would be ok."</p> <p>"Yes, I will do as you ask." He said to me.</p> <p>"Good, I'll go get you my purse." He turned and left leaving me alone in the mirror. I went inside and got my purse and looked it over. I picked up my purse and turned for him. I smiled as he smiled back while we had a short little kiss in the back. I could feel how wet I was as I looked at him in the mirror. I smiledâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
