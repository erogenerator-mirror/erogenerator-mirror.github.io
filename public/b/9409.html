"He loves to eat pussy, doesn't he, Brad?" she continued, turning to face him to rub her nipple back and forth across his face. "It's the taste and smell of fresh pussy juice that drives him wild!"</p> <p>Brad was now standing and turning towards her kneeling him. He held her head between his knees and brought his mouth directly on her mouth. Her response was to grab the back of his head and push his lips onto hers. His arms shot around her, holding her hips as he slid into her in one smooth motion. She was still facing away from him, but with her eyes still closed, it was hard to tell who she was with her mouth full of Brad's cock. She was still moaning slightly as she ground herself against the base, taking his cock as deep in her mouth as she could.</p> <p>"Yes baby, yes! That's it!" She was no longer holding on to his head, although she was holding on tightly and her breathing was becoming faster.</p> <p>He was now fucking her with the deepest first strokes, pulling almost all of his cock out and starting all over again. Each stroke pushing her body forward to meet him just the wrong way. Every thrust pushing her breasts further into her chest, the lips of her sex sliding together to make a slippery trail across his skin.</p> <p>She started to pant and he pushed harder at first, grinding his pubic mound into her, feeling his balls draw up as she rose toward her final release. "Oh baby. Your cock is so big" she grunted. Brad's face turned red as he held her head still as he released his release into her waiting mouth.</p> <p>She let him breathe, holding his head with her hands and pulling his lips down on hers. She broke off the kiss and looked up at him smiling. "You liked that did you?" she asked.</p> <p>"You won't have a problem getting back to work again."</p> <p>"I did, Brad," she assured his cheek with the tip of her tongue. "I wanted you to fuck me the way you wanted to when you were fucking me at the store."</p> <p>He laughed and got a quick kiss. "I love knowing you like it when I put you on the edge."</p> <p>"It seems the same way when you are working for me again," she continued in that sexy voice. "You will give me what I want and give me what I want with the same vigor,"</p> <p>This time their kiss was long and passionate, tongues moving between mouths to dance on each other's lips. When Brad broke the kiss, he looked down, looking almost shy, and she kissed his cheek and neck with a mischievous smile.</p> <p>"I'll never get tired of the way you play in my mind," she said with a wink. She leaned back into her chair, resting her hands on her knees, as she looked him in the eyes. "How many times will we have to tell you this?" she asked with a look of passion and determination.</p> <p>"No more than you give me," he replied in a way that made her even more excited. "Every time I want you."</p> <p>She moved forward, standing in front of him just a mere feet away, leaning in towards him, still holding his head between her hands. This time when she kissed him, she did the slow, sensual kiss that they had done so much in the storeroom last week. She pressed her lips into his, the kiss deepening so as to make it as sensual as it was. Their lips never parted.</p> <p>"You are so beautiful!" he exclaimed. "You had better go and get yourself ready!"</p> <p>They stood, taking a moment just to look each other in the eye. "There's plenty of time for that," she smiled. "You can get dressed in the meantime," she smiled.</p> <p>Brad put on his clothes and stood next to her while they looked each other in the eyes. "I can't believe we're meeting in the middle of the day," she joked. "Let's just say, even if I had my choice of guys I wouldn't have taken the time to meet you!"</p> <p>She smiled at him. "I guess I could count on that," he said, with a smile. "I'll see you later, babe."</p> <p></p> <p>Brad drove home that next morning, excitedly and without remorse. He had come to the conclusion that there was nothing wrong with a little girl, even if he had fucked her and he had enjoyed it as much as she had enjoyed it. He also knew that a girl as sexually experienced as she was didn't have the same thing in the real world. He hadn't thought of it as a girl's thing at all, but just something that would give her a little bit ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
