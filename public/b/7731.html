"I've been married, two guys and a girl for seventeen years to no other than you?"</p> <p>"God no," I muttered, then remembered something.</p> <p>"You have a beautiful wife, isn't that nice?"</p> <p>"Yes," I said, realizing a part of me wanted to cry. "I loved her so much. What more can a man ask for? Her sexiness, her beauty. She is the most sexually perfect of women and she is everything and more. She has so much about her, so much about her."</p> <p>"I'm sorry to hear that, honey," she said, "but I love you as much now as I was when I was in the army. It's always hard to tell when your heart beats so fast and when your mind takes control."</p> <p>"That's very true," I said, "but I also love the fact that she is a hot woman, that she has the sexiest, most desirable body in the world. I don't understand her cheating on me with him. She probably does it with more than him."</p> <p>"I do not cheat on you either, honey," she said, a little too happily. "I loved everything about you that I had. I never cheated on you and I never cheated on either of you in the past. The love you have for me is in your heart now, and I would hate to lose it, but if you love me and if there's a chance that I'll marry the prettiest girl around this weekend...</p> <p>"I can't live like that," I said, starting to cry.</p> <p>"No honey, you don't have to stop loving me just yet. You can do whatever you want to keep me."</p> <p>"But I love... I miss you sometimes."</p> <p>"I know. I love you too and my heart wants something to keep you, too, and you'll have more than a thousand women and men in the next several years. If you want to keep me, you can keep me."</p> <p>"Well, I can't just keep you forever, honey," I said, then suddenly realized how much I couldn't keep her if I tried. "I can't. But I can't break up with you. I just can't take the chance anymore. I'm sorry I can't do this."</p> <p>"It's alright, honey," she said, "and you and I will always be able to be together."</p> <p>I was getting frantic by now, and couldn't take the chance of saying anything that might hurt or offend her.</p> <p>"Tell me where we live, honey," she said, trying to calm me.</p> <p>"I don't think that I know of any other place that I have of course. I have no one, except you, in my love."</p> <p>"I know you did, I really do."</p> <p>"I'm not your wife," I said quickly, "you're my wife and I'll always be with you, you can't break this up between us."</p> <p>"Yes you can and should and shouldn't because you love me and we have everything in common and I'm sure you have everything in common with her. I'll always be with you honey," she said, then added quickly, "but you have nothing to worry about."</p> <p>I looked at her uncertainly, then we kissed.</p> <p>"Maybe I'll just get a motel room with someone I know. How about that?"</p> <p>"No..."</p> <p>*********</p> <p>We didn't break up on the first night, though we did break in a noisy confrontation with the football team. During the game, I got a lot of attention as well as her, and when I saw her for the first time in the football stadium I knew she was a lucky girl. I still had feelings about her but at the same time I knew it was something I could never do.</p> <p>I thought I recognized her from pictures, but to be honest when I first saw her I just couldn't find the right way to describe her face. She was beautiful, but she had a serious face that was so severe and demanding that she had to be put in the closet behind her beauty. She had long blonde hair that fell to her shoulders and had a soft and gentle quality about her.</p> <p>She had a very nice figure, she had just a little bit of padding where the lines were that would leave one's imagination open to the wonders hidden in a layer of cloth. She had full breasts that were just a little more than medium in size, but that was mostly because she didn't have the body of a woman that could wear the same cloth all the time.
