I wonder what it would be like to have that feeling.</p> <p>I look down and watch my panties get tugged down my thighs. I know it is turning me on. My fingers are sliding across them, caressing myself. My fingers dance over that wet slit and to the clit. I am going to put my fingers in me soon. I can feel the heat building within me from my own finger. My wetness is seeping from me. I spread my legs wider and move my fingers higher. The finger is now probing my hole. I am wet and tight. It is my own juices soaking my fingers and hand.</p> <p>The fingers are moving in and out of my now swollen and swollen lips. Each time it is almost out to rub against my clit but then it is back in to rub in time to the finger fucking I'm getting now.</p> <p>I'm gasping now. My eyes are closed now, my head rolling all around. My fingers are pulling, sliding, twisting, rubbing. My eyes are closed now. My hips are rocking, my mouth is wide open, and I am squealing and moaning. My knees are getting weak. My legs are trembling.</p> <p>I begin to move my hips up and down. My hand is now pushing in and out of me and up into my clit. My hips are pumping slowly. I am on the edge. Suddenly, I am moaning louder, and I scream in joy.</p> <p>My orgasm slams into me hard and deep, as a second wave rolls through me. It seems to last for hours. Time seems suspended as the intensity of my orgasm is gradually slowing. I feel my body limp, as it fades. I lie there for a minute.</p> <p>I roll onto my side and put my head on my hand and my legs over my head. I lie there. I feel the cum of the last time as it slides down my leg. I close my eyes and pretend that it is me again.</p> <p>As soon as I open them, there is the sound of the shower startling me. The water started running. I jump up and get my shorts then pull them on.</p> <p>The water feels good. It feels good to be able to be free with the water running down my bare flesh. I have to get out of here, just as quickly. I put the towel around my waist and hurry out into it again.</p> <p>I am walking down the sidewalk, my bare ass swaying a little. I stop and turn to take a big breath. I look down at my breasts and I see I have not turned them any further than I could have. I look up and see the light from the house go on again. But now it's gone. What's left and what's right. I look into my eyes and there is something in them. Something erotic.</p> <p>I hear a noise, a rustle of the sheets as they're folded and thrown back on the mattress. I look down.</p> <p>I start my car. I am in a hurry. The time is coming which is a miracle. I feel alive again. My legs spread and I slip back in and start the car.</p> <p>At the end of the block, I see a light come on at the end of the street. I lean farther down. My legs open and I hear a faint noise. It is coming from the front door of the house.</p> <p>I look at the door. It is closed. The light is on. I look out the window and there's nothing. I pull my knees up to my chest and sit there for a minute. Then it comes. I turn my head and look.</p> <p>I see the front door open. My legs open and I walk slowly down the hallway. I hear voices. I hear someone say something. I can hear them say, "Hi, sweetie," and I hear the front door being opened. I lean out of the doorway and peek into the bedroom. I see the bedroom door is closed. It is daylight. I see there's nothing in the bedroom and I look around.</p> <p>I see the bed is set. It is the middle one. I see a woman lie on the side with her legs up, and she has her head is over the end of the bed. I look at her. She is a beautiful blonde woman with her hair in a ponytail and her eyes closed. Her arms are up over her head, she's holding the end of the bed with her hands and she's leaning her back to the end, pulling the left side of her body up.</p> <p>I move forward toward the end of the bed. I can see the end of it. Its dark with only the light of the bedside lamp. I can see that the woman is on her knees and she is on her hands and knees and then she is looking back at me.
