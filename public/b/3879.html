He chuckled before continuing.</p> <p>"Mmmmm! Oh yes honey! Fuck me....harder! Fuck my ass with your huge cock..ooooooooh!" she wailed as she lifted her head so he could sink his dick into her tiny ass hole.</p> <p>He couldn't believe his luck, and his little princess seemed to enjoy it. His thoughts were now that she had never let another man fuck her ass in their entire marriage. He had only put a finger into her tight hole on special occasion just to feel that tight orifice loosen and squeeze his cock.</p> <p>He could imagine himself cumming in there. He would shoot his thick, salty load deep into her sweet ass, and then lick her clean before he slid out and let her sit down on the foot of the bed.</p> <p>"You are so naughty..." he grinned as he slowly pulled his cock out and quickly grabbed the lubricant and squirted it on his long, stiff cock. He pushed the finger all the way up inside her ass and then slid it out until he was coated with the finger's juices and then slammed it back into her with one hard shove.</p> <p>"OH FUCK!" he groaned as he pulled out and shoved his thick cock back into her tight brown hole. "Oh baby....oh...oh...oh...oh...OHHHHH! Oh!" he groaned as his body tensed in anticipation of the release that was about to occur.</p> <p>His cock erupted, and shot another load all over his stomach. He didn't know if it was a woman or a man that started it, it didn't matter since it seemed to last much longer, or was it the one in his ass, or the one in the woman's ass, or the one in the woman's ass, or the one in the woman's ass...or the one in the woman's ass, or the one in the woman's ass, or in the woman's or the one in the woman's asshole, or the one in the woman's or the one in the woman's or the one in the woman's ass, or the one in the woman's or the one in the woman's asshole. There couldn't be any way out. He finished himself off as he looked at her sitting on the edge of the bed.</p> <p>"Oh God!" he groaned again as he collapsed onto the bed.</p> <p>"I got you a present," she whispered, as she licked her lips as his cum oozed down her chin.</p> <p>"Thank you honey....!"</p> <p>"Oh please...don't go. It's only a little something this time. I'll buy some of the things I bought last night that you can't stay away from. We can make you feel more comfortable and feel more alive. And don't worry, I'll make you feel so much better."</p> <p>"That isn't any kind of promise," he warned her.</p> <p>"Of course it is. Oh, and by the way, you might want to put on some of the other clothes we bought."</p> <p>"What! Oh my god...." he started but he quickly silenced herself with the palm of his free hand. She didn't say another word, and neither did he.</p> <p>They held each other, and lay there for several minutes until he decided he didn't want to take them back to the hotel. He reluctantly did so and pulled himself up, and sat up on the edge of the bed. He then turned and pulled up the blanket, and then pulled them both into the bedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
