Her cunt-muffled whimpers were very loud, and his own whimpers added to her excitement.</p> <p>They ended up in bed, both of them naked, and spooning. He was hard again despite having just ejaculated. It was late now, she noticed, and then turned so that he could enter her.</p> <p>She gasped, and he was inside her pretty easily. It didn't feel awkward, at least for him, and he made short thrusts into her. She had an orgasm, too, with more urgency and some sounds.</p> <p>He too took charge, and he started pounding, hard at first. But their coupling was shorter and more intimate. Afterward, he was lying next to her, so that she could see her in all my body and see him in all of her as well. They slept, but not quite as fast as they had in the morning.</p> <p>It only took a brief respite for them to discover that the next day was the same as the day before, the sun was still down, but the weather was still beautiful.</p> <p>The two of them slept over late, and when she awoke in the morning, she didn't recognize the bed as her own, but the boy was still inside her. She did not get to feel more turned on than she had felt the night before, and her pussy tingled.</p> <p>She was still wearing her skirt and shirt, so when she sat down and put her hand into his lap, he started to feel her.</p> <p>She said nothing; she just did a little dance for him, putting her skirt round and round and slowly opening her legs to show him she liked what he was feeling.</p> <p>She came again, though slowly, and he came also, again in her hands. Afterwards, he just said "Morning," and got dressed and left her room.</p> <p>When she awoke with him still inside her, it dawned on her what that meant.</p> <p>She kissed him, and lay his head on her hand. His dick was still inside her, even if not as hard as before.</p> <p>"It's all right, lover," she said.</p> <p>"We'll see about fucking," he said.</p> <p>"You're still hard, and you still inside me. You got your cock inside me. I like that." She kissed him. "I'll need to feel you again a lot."</p> <p>"We'll try," he answered.</p> <p>She gave him a hug, and he did the same. He felt a bit awkward about it, but it was too late to hide from her. She turned out the lights, and then she lay still while he got up.</p> <p>"See you later," she whispered, but then gave him an almost imperceptible wink, before they went to sleep.</p> <p>The next day, her hair was still in braids. She'd worn the skirt again, the night before. She saw the boy come out of his room in his underwear and get a hard-on, with a wet feeling on her butt. She didn't even bother to pretend she didn't do it!</p> <p>He smiled at her, and left the room, but she saw the boy coming back with a towel. He didn't undress quickly, but kept smiling as if he had been there before.</p> <p>As she looked at him, he seemed like a man who was at least 18. He stood right in front of her, and she could see that his dick hadn't lost its hardness yet.</p> <p>She put her feet on the edge of the bed, and pulled him to her. Her lips made contact with his, and he started slowly to kiss her back, his lips feeling soft and soft.</p> <p>When they stopped, she put her arms down on the bed, and he took the position on the other side of her. She reached behind him and grabbed his dick. She started pulling on it.</p> <p>It felt like it was springing. He put his hand on her butt, and then he pressed it just a little harder, making her sigh.</p> <p>He continued to kiss her, which was making her feel a little more relaxed, and more aroused. She was still looking at his bulging groin and erect dick, making it hard as well.</p> <p>And when they stopped, he took the place on the other side of her, not too close. She reached underneath him, and rubbed his naked balls.</p> <p>He sighedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
