As his fingers twitched, one of his hands began to slide up and down her arm. In fact, he was lightly stroking her and she responded accordingly, sliding further down. Soon she had reached his elbow so that her hand was lying on his and it began to stroke it back. His hand was moving more firmly and she loved hearing it. He was a very attentive lover and it was nice that he was going after her hard. She knew she wanted more and she knew she wouldn't be disappointed.</p> <p>After about five minutes she slid back but kept one hand on his cock, keeping it hard as she leaned across him. He was lying there, with his cock still in her hand and she looked up into his eyes. Her hand came up to her mouth and she licked her lip and smiled. Then she lowered her face toward it. As she kissed it, he moved his hands to hold her ass and she lifted herself a little so he was between her legs. She knew she wanted to feel him fill her but that wouldn't be easy since he was still hard. She opened her legs wider and lifted her body some more. She wanted him there, inside her. He obliged.</p> <p>He had been waiting for this, but now it was getting to him. He wanted it. As he pushed in she was sure he was going to rip her apart and she didn't want it and wasn't ready to stop him. But she had to have him and she didn't want the pain. He was in her and he was fucking her. He was loving it. She raised her hips up and he pushed in once more.</p> <p>She loved him, but she wanted to feel his cock inside her. She looked at the time and saw that it was 9:30. She wanted his cock, not his hands. She lowered her body again so he could push in and when she raised her hips a little he was inside her. She could feel her own orgasm building so she thrust her hips up and began to meet his cock at the bottom.</p> <p>He held his body still for a few seconds making sure his cock was still inside her. Slowly his hands moved down her body and she wrapped her legs around his waist. When they were done, he was still hard and his hands moved between them. He put his fingers on either side of her clit and rubbed, and stroked it as he continued to push into her. He was almost there so he began to pick up the pace. She loved it and pushed her hips up toward him. It was no longer about her pleasure. His fingers were rubbing it vigorously and she loved the feeling. It was time, too, for her body.</p> <p>He leaned over her once again and kissed her mouth as his hands roamed over her body. "You're mine."</p> <p>He lifted first one thigh and then the other and rubbed the outside as his hands lifted one leg and his body settled on hers. She smiled as he lifted her. He was on his hands and knees now and her legs wrapped around him once more. His cock pressed into her pussy and she pulled her knees back trying to impale herself to his cock but he held back. She was his.</p> <p>"Fuck me, please, Steve."</p> <p>Steve raised his head and looked at her. "You are mine, Mom."</p> <p>"And I'm yours, honey."</p> <p>She looked at him and smiled. "Are you sure it's ok with me?"</p> <p>"God yes. I am your man, Mom. Can we be lovers forever?" He kissed his mother's lips and her arms went around his neck.</p> <p>"We'll see, sweetheart."</p> <p>"Yes," he said with a smileâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
