The black leather couch had long since been removed but there was not so much as room to spare the small kitchen.</p> <p>"Oh. Oh. You look...I've never noticed."</p> <p>"Not so much, come on in please."</p> <p>Getting up, she walked down the hallway and peeked into the bathroom. The tub was filled with water that dripped from the showerhead. Sitting in the tub, Rachel turned on the hot water and began the warm bath.</p> <p>"Oh, uh, oh."</p> <p>Walking behind her, her hand brushed through the damp curls and her eyes met Rachel's. He was beautiful, even more so if it was the right night. Her gaze moved from his eyes to his face and back up again. "Rachel..."</p> <p>Rachel smiled at him but continued on with her bath.</p> <p>"Rachel," he whispered.</p> <p>Rachel turned and saw him with his back to her and his head propped against the wall. They both stood there. Her gaze shifted to his face. As she stood beside him, she could feel the heat of his body on top of hers. His arms slid around her waist as he pulled her against his body.</p> <p>Rachel gasped as his fingers lightly grazed her breast. "Oh." He cupped her ass with his large hands and squeezed.</p> <p>He could feel her heart beating against his skin. Rachel bit her lip and leaned her head back. The water was cooling her neck and she felt herself getting incredibly moist.</p> <p>"Now," he whispered, "let's see how this bath can get better."</p> <p>"Oh. Oh," she said again in response.</p> <p>He ran his hands up her back and under her hair. As he massaged her hair, his eyes were on her face again.</p> <p>"Is the tub warmer?" Rachel asked softly.</p> <p>"Uh-huh," he whispered back.</p> <p>His hands began to pull her head back and forth against his chest. His hands moved down from her hair to the small of her back. His fingers brushed her sides and then moved over her hips and down to her ass. His fingers slid between her and the water. He cupped his hands around her ass as she leaned her head back.</p> <p>"Hmmm..."</p> <p>His fingers were on her thighs again. He held her firmly against his body. Rachel had to lean up against his chest to sit down. Both of their bare chests were brushing against each other. His hands moved around her waist and then back up her sides. His fingertips gently caressed her breasts under the water.</p> <p>"Rachel..." he murmured into her ear.</p> <p>"Hm?" Rachel said with a frown.</p> <p>"Hm."</p> <p>Her eyes widened in shock.</p> <p>"What?" she asked, sounding a little confused.</p> <p>"Hmmm..."</p> <p>"Oh," she said as she lifted her eyes once more and looked into his eyes. "No?"</p> <p>"Uh-huh..." he repeated her question.</p> <p>"But?"</p> <p>"Well," he began. "Hm, a...well, I don't really remember the last time I was this...haha. You know me."</p> <p>"Yes," she said, "I remember."</p> <p>"Oh," he said, again in a slightly more seductive tone. This time he pulled his hands back and stood up and walked toward the bathroom.</p> <p>Sitting on the toilet, Rachel watched as he reached for the loo. It was a beautiful golden brown and it made her mouth water. Rachel had never thought of herself as bisexual. She just liked men but she had never considered herself bisexual.</p> <p>"I'll take this," she said as she got to her feet. She turned and walked back to her bath.</p> <p>Rachel turned on her side with her side to her and reached back and lifted her hair. With the water running over her body, she could not help but think of what it would feel like to have the warmth of his body pressed against her. She turned back to her bath. "Wow. That was...that was..." Her voice trailed off as she took in her surroundings. There was a small pile of folded clothes on the floor. The room looked like a kitchen. There were pots and pans, dishes, chairs and even a door.</p> <p>"Yeah," he said.</p> <p>"Hmm." She took off the bath towel and walked back to her shower. Taking the glass, she climbed in. "Wow...this feels a little strange without the shower."</p> <p>"So, no more surprises," he said with a smile as he turned on the water.</p> <p>Rachel took inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
