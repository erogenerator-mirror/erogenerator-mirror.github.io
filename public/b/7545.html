I saw another hand on her thigh as another tongue ran over her lips, it seemed that she licked and sucked on it, as her hand worked up and down my cock. My hand slowly stroked her hair as she moved, her head was moving up and down, up and down faster and faster. Soon, I heard the wet sounds of a wet mouth wrapped around my cock as she sucked. The wet sounds in the background of the music was like a sound of pleasure, like my own cum was being sucked away, I felt my balls tightening, they were pulling at me with each stroke of the hand in her hair.</p> <p>"Mmmmmm, this is a nice one there, I wonder...."</p> <p>"It's a nice one isn't it?" I heard a giggle.</p> <p>"Y-Yes...M-My..."</p> <p>"Good enough for you?" She sucked harder, moving her head up and down much faster now, almost faster than before.</p> <p>"A-All my friends..."</p> <p>"That what your problem, little slave?" She looked up; the face was now an impassive.</p> <p>"No, you're no better. I-I-uh"</p> <p>"And you don't care yet, what's the matter?" Her voice was a sweet mixture, sex and the light from the lightening flashes of the candles.</p> <p>"A-A-I-N-I-A-I-NO, I don't"</p> <p>"Well...maybe I won't give you a choice, you'd like that, wouldn't you?"</p> <p>"I don't know," she said, looking up. "I'm just not sure what to think, why doesn't anyone else say anything?"</p> <p>"Well...I've never had anyone touch me," I said, wondering what else had changed my mind. I mean, it's not like I haven't had sex, I've thought about being touched, but not really with anyone before. But there was something else.</p> <p>"How does that make you feel?"</p> <p>"I-It seems pretty strange...I think..maybe it's because of what I'm feeling right now-I never thought..."</p> <p>"That's a relief isn't it? I can tell!" She looked up, and I realized she was blushing now. "I'm glad it's you, I like your touch."</p> <p>"Oh I like it too," I replied in a voice that was somewhere between a whine and a moan, and was half heartedly pleading for her to take it another level.</p> <p>I felt like all the pain that I felt in my life had been replaced with an intense, exciting feeling of pleasure.</p> <p>"How does it make you feel?" I felt as though I was about to fall to my ass.</p> <p>"It's really hard, it's different," she paused. "It feels so different."</p> <p>"Would it be fun if I wanted to touch you all over?"</p> <p>"Why should I care? I mean-I'll never make you cum, I just do like having you touch me. Are you sure you know what you're doing?"</p> <p>"I do...I've always thought it would be something a little k-kinky, it's hard to imagine doing it if you're not with someone who...I don't know."</p> <p>"Well, maybe when I get home you'll have something planned or something on your mind that will help put things in perspective and let you remember what it felt like to have your body stimulated while others watched. After all, I think it doesn't have anything to do with that, but...and how's that sound to you?"</p> <p>"Well, not just the idea, I think that..." She took a breath. "That's kind of what I mean to say...but..." she smiled</p> <p>"So you want to feel all this pleasure and just let it happen all over again, when will you be home alone?"</p> <p>"I'll call you tomorrow...and tell you what I have to say!" she pulled herself off my now pulsating rod, and with a smile, and a wink. "And then, I'll call you and decide if I'll see you tomorrow."</p> <p>And that was the night that I met the other womanâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
