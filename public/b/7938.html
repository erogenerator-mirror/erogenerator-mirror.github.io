And I felt a shiver, one that I never knew could take away a woman's touch. My own nipples hardened in the cool room, a sensation of both pleasure and consternation. She ran her hands down my neck and behind, and started to caress my breasts with her thumbs, gently massaging them, then sliding them back behind my neck, so that I could do nothing to stop her. They were sensitive by nature, but they also gave me goose-bumps as she caressed them.</p> <p>I felt as she continued, then her kisses became more aggressive, and I felt the first of her kisses on my left nipple, then my right. "Oh my God... " I said, as she sucked it into her mouth. I thought, to this day, that I had the nub of my nipple in her mouth with one hand, while the other hand was playing with the right one.</p> <p>"So beautiful," she said, running her fingernail lightly through my pubic hair as she did it. I moaned softly in reply. I felt warmth spread throughout my loins, and I felt the warmth growing slowly from between my legs. "Oh my God, this feels so good," I said.</p> <p>"Do you like it?" she whispered, licking her lips.</p> <p>"Oh my God, it's so good..." I said, continuing to run my fingers through her hair. "My God, this feels so good."</p> <p>"So do you, too," I whispered, feeling as she ran her lips down my belly. She stopped her kissing for a moment, leaving my nipples fully exposed, then she slowly trailed her kisses down my belly, and further down. I didn't care how sensitive my nipples were, I just wanted more. "Oh, God, I can't wait any longer. I can feel the excitement in my loins even though I have my eyes closed."</p> <p>"That's because you're lying there, waiting for me," she said. "You're ready for me now, baby," she said, licking the outline of my lower lips with the tip of her tongue. I felt myself go weak in the knees, and almost fell in love at this exquisite torture, but at the same time I didn't care. Her tongue found the opening of my womanhood, and then it entered me with her tongue. Her hands gripped my bottom, and she began to tongue-fuck me, using a circular motion that caused my hips to thrust upward.</p> <p>But she went right back to my nipples, again, causing me to moan, then she kissed her way down to the place where my panties met my butt, where her lips kissed the fabric covering my anus. And she slid her tongue, one, then two fingers along the crack of this ass, causing me to let out an almost-chirp of delight when he first touched me there, and then she slid her middle finger into my slick pussy. It didn't take very long to get wet enough to coat her finger with my juices, and as she slid it in and out of my vagina, she inserted a second finger, and a third.</p> <p>She kissed my abdomen, moving toward my clit, and then ran a finger all around my pussy, sliding inside it. I had been so focused on her finger in my pussy, that nothing of this had occurred until she touched me, so I let my breath out in gasps of ecstasy. I could have cried, or run, I don't know. And yet, I don't care, as long as I had her. Her mouth never left my nipple, and as my entire torso heaved upward, it seemed like I was going to have an orgasm.</p> <p>Then her tongue hit my clitoris at the same time her fingers stroked into my pussy, and a shudder ran through me, my entire body went rigid, and my knees weakened, but I managed to stand back again. I was shaking so badly, shaking against the floor with an uncontrolled, involuntary tremor that made my muscles tremble. "Oh, my God, that felt incredible!" I gasped, looking down at her as she crawled between my legs. She stopped for a second, then plunged her tongue into my mouth, as she pressed her lips against mine.</p> <p>"My God," I said, in a whisper. "You taste like sweet wine."</p> <p>"Do you think so?" she asked, and with that she leaned forward and kissed me again, then moved away, leaving me hanging there for what felt like days for several moments. "What about your pussy?" she whispered again, sliding a finger inside my vagina.</p> <p>"Oh, God," I replied. "It feels so very good.
