I turned and looked right at her. “Are you sure, or would you rather I stopped being able to think?”</p> <p>She looked deep into my eyes, and finally gave up on asking. “Oh, no,” she said. “Now we’re going to go home. I want to make it up to you.”</p> <p>I took her hand, pulled us toward the house, and pulled her into the house.</p> <p></p> <p>*****</p> <p></p> <p>We went up the stairs to my room and I pushed her back against the door. “I never thought I could be that way, but here we are.” She kissed me and grabbed the bottom of my shirt while I opened her pants and pulled her pants off.</p> <p>She was wearing black lace thong panties. “Oh my,” she exclaimed. “You don’t have to stop there, but I want you to.”</p> <p>I grabbed her and pushed her back against the wall. I could smell her sex. The smell was intoxicating. My dick was hard as a steel rod and had throbbed when I looked at her. “I can’t wait,” I whispered. She leaned me back against the wall again. She pulled my shirt over my head and threw it aside. Our naked bodies were touching as if they were magnets. “You can undress me if you want to,” I whispered. She slowly removed my clothes.</p> <p>My dick was almost to her feet. She was looking at my dick and licking her lips. It was the first time I had seen her with it out and now she was looking up at it hungrily. She leaned down and took my cock into her mouth. It was like my body was on fire. Without giving me much time to react I grabbed her head and pulled her away.</p> <p>“Not here,” I said. “I want you to be with me right here at this house. We need to be alone and get to know each other. I’m going to teach that sweet young thing a lesson she hasn’t even thought about yet.”</p> <p>She nodded her head up and down. “Please don’t take this the wrong way,” she said. She stood up again and I got another grip on her hair. “Don’t be so impatient.”</p> <p>“Do me,” I said. I pulled her on her hands and knees. Her ass was already up and up in the air. I grabbed the string on her bra as I yanked it off. The top was so thin that it almost covered her nipples. I pulled it down to the waistband of her thong. The tiny strip of cloth that covered her pussy, had almost disappeared and the sight of her ass framed by her thong was too much for me to take. “Do yourself,” I whispered. She was moaning as I got on the bed and crawled between her legs. I was so hot and so horny that it took less than two seconds for me to shoot my load into her.</p> <p>“Don’t move,” was all I could say. I pulled out my softening dick and watched as her cheeks had turned red.” You were right,” she said. She was sitting on the edge of my bed and we had just sat there staring at each other. I got off the bed, pulled my shirt off, tossed it aside, and lay next to her on the bed. We didn’t say much for the first hour or so but just stared out of the window and stared at the stars.</p> <p>About five minutes into our conversation, she turned over and lay on her back. “Can’t we just kiss,” she said. I knew right away that she meant it. It was like we were on a mission, and she wanted to show me her skills. I kissed my way down her neck, and onto her breasts. I could feel them, as if they were attached to something on an electrical wire. I sucked her nipples and began to alternate gently. She was moaning in response. I kissed my way further down, licking the sides of her tits. She was sooo good. I found her pussy and began to eat her pussy. I loved doing that. She tasted good. “Eat me,” she said. I had a tongue in my wife’s pussy! I licked her harder. She was starting to go wild. We switched over but she wasn’t getting away. She spread her legs as far as she could and I continued to lick and taste her pussy. I was about to go crazy when she said, “Stop.�—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
