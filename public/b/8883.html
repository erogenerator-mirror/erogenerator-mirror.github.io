It had seemed so true at the time.</p> <p>"Don't even think of it that way."</p> <p>"Is this some sort of sexual thing?"</p> <p>I laughed, and said, "I guess not, but if you can't stand to meet your friends tonight, you can have me."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" she demanded. I paused. "Okay, I agree but maybe you're not ready for that," I said. I was not joking.</p> <p>"No, no!" she snapped and slapped my cheek. "I'm here for you. Come on. Just give me a chance."</p> <p>I said, "I told you you weren't my type."</p> <p>"Don't call me that. My type is all right."</p> <p>"What kind of a girl do you think I am?" I said. I was still surprised, because I didn't think the girl he was dating would be anything like she was.</p> <p>"A hot one," she whispered, as she pulled off her blouse, and unhooked her bra while I stood back waiting helplessly. "I know how much you would love to feel that," she said, as she began to play with herself.</p> <p>"No, I won't do that." I couldn't make eye contact with her, so she grabbed my chin and lowered her head. She kissed me deeply, and pressed her body closely to mine. The heat I had always felt when I came made my heart race. We both seemed excited, and we knew it wouldn't be long before we would both be nude, and we would soon be in each others arms.</p> <p>By my third kiss, I felt myself melting under the pressure. I wanted that. I wanted her. I wanted my first time to be about her, when we actually felt the passion that we were in our hearts for each other. She must understand. She knew what she was doing.</p> <p>As we stood next to each other, she began to remove her skirt. When she let it fall away from her, I took her in my arms and kissed her. She had a beautiful tan, smooth with just a touch of wisp of hair covering the lower edges of her breast. She smelled clean. I could smell her excitement, a subtle musky scent and, as it got stronger, a very sweet and erotic fragrance. I knew that she liked what I smelled.</p> <p>The touch of her hands on mine aroused me even further. I could feel her arousal as her excitement grew. She felt her excitement in my arousal. I was fully erect. I had to know I could be able to make love to her. But I couldn't think of anyone else; even one. I also didn't know if I could make love to her.</p> <p>As she reached down and found my hardness, I whispered to her, "You're pretty hot, you know."</p> <p>She smiled as she lifted her hand to me then turned to pick her skirt off the floor. I pulled our kiss and her body off mine before she could do anything else with her hair. I quickly went back to kissing her, feeling for her pussy, and found it and my mouth. When I found it, she spread herself, and I began to lap, and suck, and finger her. I moved my hand under her to feel for her clit, which she was so wet that I was sure it'd lubricate for me with her.</p> <p>I started to rub her clit in slow circles. I rubbed my fingers over her pussy lips. I moved first one finger, and then two fingers into her and slowly began to slowly fuck her as she lay back and took my fingers in her pussy, while my thumb rubbed her clit back and forth.</p> <p>"Ohhhh, fuck me, make me cum," She cried into my mouth.</p> <p>And she did. Her body shook and her hips lifted up, as if she was going to let me go on top of her. At her signal, I pulled my fingers out, and moved them to her pussy. I used the fingers on my mouth to wet them myself. I licked her, and then slid my face back between her legs to lick her there. She squealed and moaned, moving her legs to open herself. I moved myself under her, where my lips on her exposed skin parted a little more, exposing my erect cock.</p> <p>I began to lick her again. I could sense how much her excitement and moisture were as I used my mouth to pleasure her. I could also smell her excitement. I moved my lips from her pussy to her anus. I pushed a finger up her ass until it was inside. I knew that she was ready for me. I pushed my tongue deeper in herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
