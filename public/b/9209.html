We fucked in the shower. Please stop it! We're in the middle of something!" The water turned icy. She grabbed her towel off the counter, threw it on and then wiped off the glass of water before throwing it into the pool. I followed behind, a little concerned at the sound of her towel falling away in the water. "We were really good on that one, were we?"</p> <p>"You're telling me." She turned and wrapped her arms around my chest kissing my neck as I wrapped mine around her waist. It took most of us to move. The cold water on our skin turned out to be very refreshing. It warmed us up nicely and I didn't think anything I said made sense. Then the door to the bathroom opened and in stepped my wife. It looked like she was about 5'4" or 5'5" and I could only take about 100 yards, but we got used to the sight quickly anyway so my mind was elsewhere. It took her a few minutes to answer our call to the bathroom, and I saw her looking right at me across the bathroom. "Are you OK in there?"</p> <p>"Yes, we were just looking at the pool and getting a little hot." The view of her breasts through her towel gave me an instant hard-on and the sound of the water as it puddled around us gave me the strength to pull her close to me and kiss her again. She ran to the shower and I followed her in moments later; I was in a daze as her naked body was pressed up against mine and her hands caressing the front of my swim trunks. With one hand still clinging to the front of my hard-on, she lifted it slowly out of its confinement and it sprang back to attention.</p> <p>"I'm sorry about earlier. I thought you guys would take care of it so it would just be a natural thing. I know you guys never liked that and I guess we didn't either, but it felt nice enough. Please don't worry." She was smiling now and it looked as though she was just as excited as I was.</p> <p>"I didn't even know my wife could do that."</p> <p>"It's cool. I'm not doing much. I can do this for you too." She was still smiling but her eyes still looked a little apprehensive. I wanted to kiss her before I took things any further but just held off and watched her as she stood under the shower running the hot water over herself. "God you are beautiful. I love the way you turn the water on. I think your husband, or better yet your boyfriend, would agree with you anytime you want."</p> <p>"You're not my husband."</p> <p>"I like to think you're my husband, and the most important person in the world."</p> <p>She was looking between my legs when she said it. She lifted up each side of her skirt and showed just a hint of her skin below her navel where a tiny bikini bottom held the water in the air in the middle as her fingers found her very aroused lips. The sight of that sent me over the first hurdle I had set for myself. I had never seen my wife's nipples before, and this was only the second I thought I could see the outline of her areola through her top. I thought it was strange that I had never even considered what it must be to look so sexually, but to my great surprise and arousal she said, "My friends are going to like the view. Now go ahead and get out of the shower. I promise you'll have a good time with a sexy stud like yourself."</p> <p>She did have a sexy stud. My thoughts began to run rampant again as she reached inside her wet suit and cupped my balls as a hand covered mine. "Your balls are big. Can I do that?" Her voice was deep and soft, almost seductive. I looked into her large green eyes and could not believe how turned on I felt at the mere touch of the girl I had known as a baby. My cock was rock hard as she leaned in to kiss me and as our lips met, my hands slipped beneath her top and were soon fondled and stroked as she had been doing for me. I kissed her neck and the nape of her throat and could taste the saltiness of her skin as my fingers found her nipples and lightly flicked them. As she felt my erection against her thigh she moaned in my face.</p> <p>"Just enjoy it, honey. I'm going to get even with you for this." She didn't need any more encouragement. I moved my hands to her breasts; she grabbed her shirt and pulled it all the way up over her head while her nipples hardened more in my hands. In one hard motion she dropped her top to the floor of the shower and threw her bra onto the floor and then she was pushing her sandals off herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
