He looked at her with a smile, not just for being a lover that could be considered a husband, but because she had become so much more. He kissed her, the kiss that started with him touching her in such an intimate place. Her face flushed. He kissed her neck, and up around her ear, and whispered, "I'm just here with you to fuck me, sweetheart, and I want you so much that I'm going to fuck you all night long."</p> <p>She had the urge to run away right then, knowing that her husband was her husband, and they could be together forever, if the desire came. She looked him straight in the eye, "Yes, John, I will. But please, don't make me wait. I can't live without you." It felt so wonderful. He kissed the corner of her mouth, "Baby, you are so lovely. You make me very happy. Please do that for me?"</p> <p>She kissed him and smiled, "I just want you. It's been so long, hasn't it?"</p> <p>"Oh, it's been a long, long time too, hasn't it!"</p> <p>With their legs intertwined, his soft cock gently slipped along the line of her body as he laid his head on her soft breast, holding her tightly to him. Their kissing grew more passionate, their tongues entwined.</p> <p>At some point, it was apparent that he was in the mood for this, because he gently slid his cock back and forth between her thighs until the wet tip was rubbing up and down her moist lips. He slid the tip up and down the length of her slit, just touching her opening with the tip of his cock. He could feel her trembling as he slid the tip into her opening. As I looked at the sight in front of me, I could see it. She gasped and tried to sit up. He continued the motion, while she moved around on the bed, trying to escape and run with the excitement of the moment.</p> <p>"Baby?"</p> <p>"John? It's me. I love you. Do it. I want the world to know that I love you."</p> <p>He started, "I don't know what I want to do, sweetheart. I haven't had the chance to show you anything that you don't already know. Can you at least tell me where in the world you go from there? Can you see that this all goes far enough to say that the world exists in space, where we live and live together?"</p> <p>He moved the head of his cock up and down the line of hair in her pussy, feeling it stretch out and move in a slow, circular motion.</p> <p>With each movement, she moaned and tried to move her hips around. He had a way of making her move and move and move in slow, circular motions.</p> <p>"Please," she said, "give it to me. I'm wet. Can we..."</p> <p>To my surprise and delight, he thrust three inches of his tool into her wet pussy, all the way to the top. And just when I thought she was going to stop it, she took me back. The sight of her looking at me, seeing me looking at her, and me giving her this gift turned her on so much. I don't even want to know how it felt to give myself to her this way. She took my cock all the way in the end and held it as it was about to come out of her, so that we could both watch it coming out. I wanted to see her watching herself. She took my cock inside of her and I felt the walls of her pussy contract around me, as I had never felt anything so fantastic.</p> <p>She said, "This is so wonderful, John. It's been so long for me. Thank you."</p> <p>She looked down and smiled at him, "Thank you. You make love to me. Thank you for letting me be free in my time with you. I want to do this for us both, like no one before," and she took him in her hand and moved so that I could see her move my cock again in her pussy, taking it slowly in and out, so that we could both take in this view of her being so open.</p> <p>She kissed him again and said, "It's ok; it's just the first step. It's all just part of what we have." She smiled at him again, kissed him as if for peace. "I want to love you. I want this to be perfect. Let's go to bed and rest a while and enjoy this."</p> <p>He felt his face red. "What is it, love? I'm not sure that a man like you could give up sex like that. You've made me more of a womanâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
