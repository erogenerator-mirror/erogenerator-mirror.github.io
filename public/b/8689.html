Then I opened the back door and walked out into my car and started it up. I knew her from somewhere but I had no idea where I would be going. I drove into my new home city. I had rented it from a college girl and bought a new car a month before.</p> <p>I drove down the street to her new BMW. I got out and went around to open the garage and got a couple of bags. While I did this I saw some things move and then there was a black BMW that looked like it didn't belong. The door opened and I looked in the rear view mirror and saw what I wanted to see. There were a pair of dark blue silk panties and a white bra that showed through the material but left some visible. On this BMW there looked like a girl in her underwear except the underwear was white. I thought I was going to walk by this all day.</p> <p>I went around to the front and got out a pair of dark blue panties. Again there were a couple of matching bras that looked like a girl in my underwear underwear and a pink bra that looked like a girl with a bra on. Then there was a pair of panties that were a couple of panties. I also thought I was getting carried away but could never find out the reasons why they were used for underwear.</p> <p>I went to her door and opened it and waited a minute then went inside and went down the hallway and knocked on her door.</p> <p>"Come in," she said.</p> <p>"Ok," I said.</p> <p>"Come in," she said.</p> <p>I walked into her room and she closed the door and then sat down on the bed. I went into the kitchen, bent down and poured myself a glass of water then put the glass down. I looked in the closet. There was a small table in there like a dresser and had a pair of dark blue silk underwear in there also. Just like her bra I could only see where they ended. Next drawer I got some silk panties which I would have to find. I looked out the hallways and noticed the bed was still up so I bent down and picked them up. I was still looking through all of the clothes so picked them up and went around back.</p> <p>I returned in the hall and saw that she had a drawer open.</p> <p>"Put these on," she said.</p> <p>I went back inside and put them on. Next drawer had a set of pantyhose and a pair of underwear covered panties. Then my dresser drawer was full of clothes. I found some shoes and went back into the main room and went out to the garage and got some clothes and went back in to work.</p> <p>After cleaning up the garage I thought it was time to do some shopping. I had decided to go all out and get some really nice clothes and even some cheap ones. I went out to one of the local stores and took several bags that I carried around. I also got some clothes and some shoes. I decided to take everything and carry it as far back as I wanted and return the purchases to my new apartment.</p> <p>On my way back to my new apartment I drove through the neighborhood until it was one-lane paved road. The neighborhood was empty and the houses were large. I stopped at one and decided I could use the bathroom right there but this was not how I wanted to do my shopping. I pulled up in front of a large old Victorian style building. All the floors had been boarded up but one area of the structure was open to the air. I checked the number and I took a deep breath then the door of the bathroom opened on it's own. I was not sure what to expect at this place because there was a small butler on it's side waiting for me.</p> <p>The man I was looking at looked at me and said "I am the guest. You'll be needing a bathroom."</p> <p>"A bath?" I said while looking at him.</p> <p>"In the spare bedroom" the man said motioning toward the spare bedroom that led to the main bedroom.</p> <p>I looked down the hallway and sure enough there was a bathroom with a large window and two small walk-in closets.</p> <p>There was a small butler sitting on a couch in the spare bedroom.</p> <p>"What are you doing there?" I said with shock and a lump in my throat.</p> <p>He looked at me again and said "There is only a couple of bedrooms and I am sure you would like use of the bathroom."</p> <p>"Nope" I said, "I can use the master bathroom and I would like to use it while you are in the bathroom."</p> <p>"What are you doing here?" I said.</p> <p>"I was looking for a woman to make me a guest." He said.</p> <p>"You want to make me aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
