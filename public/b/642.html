He began fucking her. "My son."</p> <p>"I will not." She said, his words echoing in her head. "I will not get pregnant."</p> <p>"Yes," He said "You will." She turned back to the man, "and I will not either. This will be your first time and you will need to show your self." He said it so casually and gently. He reached up and tweaked her nipple. His voice was so commanding and commanding. His words were so sexy, they were so gentle, it was so sexy. He continued fucking her. She felt herself going over the edge and she lost all control of her body. She wanted to scream out. She wanted him to stop but he would not. He kept fucking her. She found that one sound that made her body go into orgasm after orgasm. And when she finally got control of herself she would have fallen over if he hadn't grabbed her by the hips and lifted her off the chair. The woman sat down on her thighs, holding her down with her powerful legs. She couldn't feel his thrusts but it was enough to make her eyes roll in head. She looked in his eyes but he was gone. It was over. It was done.</p> <p>And with that, he pushed her off the chair. But she didn't fall down. She was so wet that it went everywhere but she could feel herself getting wetter. He was going to go further than before. He wanted to push himself in. She wouldn't stop him. She would give herself to him as he wanted. And she would enjoy it. She would enjoy sex as often as he liked it. With him she was just plain a sex toy. A tool to satisfy him. That was all he would get. Her desire was his to show. "You will," she heard herself say again. "That's no way to treat a woman." "I love to please you," she heard herself say. "Make love to me," He said, as the man continued fucking her.</p> <p>Lara felt another surge of desire. The man had wanted her in a way beyond just to fuck again and she would get to do it again. She wanted him to touch her more. The moment he did so, she lost control and her body shook with it. The woman moaned and he stopped. Her body continued to tremble as she felt him begin to soften his grip from its death grip. His body pulled from her. The woman looked at him as if he meant nothing at all. "Take me...take me now, give me the love of your life," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. She could feel his cum oozing out of her body, down her thighs, in a puddle along with her juices. "My child," she said.</p> <p>He pushed himself from her body. He leaned against her, kissing her, licking her breasts. He continued kissing her, her neck, lips tasting her sweet skin. "Baby," he said again. "Take me. Please, make love to me. I want to enjoy a woman." Her own words brought him back to reality. "Your son will give me a baby."</p> <p>"Yes," Lara said, "we will make love again." He put his arms around her and pulled her tight against him. His penis was back up inside her body. The sensations had not subsided but they were still there. Lara didn't care. He had found such a treasure, such a man. She wanted him again. She wanted him inside her, with her. "Take him again," she said "Put your hands under him again."</p> <p>The woman held his face between her hands, looking into his eyes. He looked at her face. Her eyes were a soft brown. But there was something else in them. She was a woman he would never want. He couldn't take that away though. "I will. You have nothing to fear." He said. She opened her eyes and smiled. She knew.</p> <p>He kissed her gently. She felt his lips on hers, tasting his saliva. The kiss was as much about him as it was about her. It was soft, a little uncomfortable. But it wasn't just about him. It was about her. She wanted him again, not just as her lover, but as a man. Now it was back to her. He lay next to her, their bodies pressing against each other while his lips kissed her. She felt his hand move up to her chest. She felt the other hand slide down her skin just above her knee. As it traveled up her inner thigh, she could feel herself opening to him. He was touching her again. The desire was still there.
