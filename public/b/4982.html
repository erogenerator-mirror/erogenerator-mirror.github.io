"It's my treat for being so good to you."</p> <p>"That is nice."</p> <p>She took one wine out of the cabinet and had me follow her up stairs, where we had the king-size bed set up for us. She got comfy on the bed, and I laid on my back. She got comfortable, and began her oral service. First, she licked, sucked, and kissed the tip and then took the whole of the head, flogged her hand with it, got it wet and sucked the last few drops.</p> <p>After a short while of pleasuring me orally, she got between my legs, and was about to pull my cock up and begin sucking it. "What about you?"</p> <p>"I'm going to be a good boy for a bit, and then let you get me ready for you," I said.</p> <p>"That's ok, Jack."</p> <p>She licked her hand, then used her mouth, and I was loving every second. "You haven't cum yet," I said.</p> <p>She paused, "Yes, I've been working on that for a while."</p> <p>"I have one more for you, and it's going to be as good as the first. But remember, when you cum, you cum from me with my mouth on your cock."</p> <p>She looked up at one of the clock on the wall, and added, "It's your time, Jack. And you're the boss." She looked back up at her husband. It's been a long time, and I had to admit he was a lucky man.</p> <p>"I'll let you get one of us something to drink, and maybe have another one, and call you to have me do this more often," she said, and took a sip of wine, "and a toast."</p> <p>"Thank you, darling."</p> <p>"Well, maybe I should go get some breakfast, and put it back together. The guys have been calling me up, and I'm going to be gone two weeks, and they're coming and going, and I'm going to be home. I guess we're going to have to stop calling you."</p> <p>"You could call me, honey," I said.</p> <p>"Don't you love it when I call you, to you? That's not fair, is it? I call you baby, I call you sweetheart, I call you what you are, and what will make you great. Oh! I have a little one I've been wanting to borrow this morning. And you can fuck it."</p> <p>"Ok, honey, I got this in time, thank you."</p> <p>We chatted for awhile, and then she leaned over the head of the chair and asked if we'd come down to dinner after we had dinner, and maybe have another glass of wine. We went downstairs as a couple, and we had a good time in the sitting room. I noticed as I had her in my arms earlier that she had put on two glasses of wine. When we talked about them, we were not drinking, and I think she did not realize. We had one glass of wine each in the dinette. But I do not think she realized we were both trying not to look at the TV that she had already put in front of us.</p> <p>When we finished eating, she told me that she and her husband were going to go get ready to go to bed early, and then she could come back later to say goodnight and call me.</p> <p>"Would you like to have a glass of wine with me for an early night? I have a gift for you."</p> <p>In front of me, we had two wine glasses, and she brought out a large white bowl of mixed eggs, and we had a toast. We looked at each other for a minute, and then she went to her cabinet and got two glass of wine. "I don't know how I'm going to take this", she said, as she removed the sheet and brought it out to bed.</p> <p>"Why don't you try them, Jack?"</p> <p>Once again, I was looking at her beautiful legs, and thinking to myself, "I could never go one more night without getting them completely naked for you." But once again, I was not looking at anything she had brought out. Instead, I studied her body - long legs, and her perfect little boobs... all nice looking to me.</p> <p>"Well," she said, "If you're all wet, you can put some of this on in a minute, before you change your mind."</p> <p>With that, she put the egg on top of the other things in the top drawer. "Come here, and help me," she said, pointing to the side of the bed. I came to her, and she opened up aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
