Please don't talk so dirty. I like the sound; I love how rough we are together.' With that I pulled the plug from her anus and moved myself in towards her with all my strength, my dick hard and straight. I grabbed her hips and forced my dick into her and she howled as I violated her virgin asshole. I pounded into her as she thrashed about underneath me, her body going into a frenzy of pleasure. She reached down and started to rub my ball sac as I continued my assault. She was thrashing about in pleasure. I could feel my balls tighten and the pressure to cum built inside. I pulled my dick from her, leaving her ass spasms, and began to aim it at her face. She opened her mouth. I let another wad of semen fall into her mouth as her eyes rolled back into her head and she swallowed. I held on to her for about 10 minutes.</p> <p>We had to do this. Not every man is worth taking the first step. But that's what happened. That's what it was for the next year, and we went home the moment we finished our first act together. We became friends, and after two or three months she stopped mentioning sex. For her, our friendship became more intense. I wanted to help her; I could sense a closeness between her and I. I could see how sexually dominant she really was; she was the perfect submissive. We could talk about her ass and see where it would make it as she grew.</p> <p>A few months went by; we were both in denial. It didn't seem to matter. It was as if something was coming. We became lovers. At first we just liked fucking each other's hot holes - but the night after a few months we had sex twice, and it was explosive. She loved it - it was like having true sex. I loved it, and I don't mean just raw sex, she loved it. I never thought it could be as intense with someone as she did with me. In a way, it was like the beginning of a sexual relationship. Maybe it was because she wanted to fuck; she wanted to be fucked by a man. Not just fuck. But fuck in both holes, and that was what she wanted.</p> <p>In retrospect...</p> <p>I don't know if she felt the same way or not about what we were doing. We just didn't know how to proceed. We'd talk often but never really have a chance to really make it. We liked having sex, that made us feel more complete. We'd talk about it... maybe once every morning or sometimes twice a day during the week. I tried it - I tried making sense of it. I found myself becoming more and more into her. I'd listen in after our dates, then at one point I'd get up, leave, and be back in bed when she came home horny. I tried being alone. But, she talked. She liked to go out or go back to her house or even to her work; to the point where we didn't talk to each other for the next few months. And we didn't stop fucking each time we got together but at a different time. The sex was always good as usual and we'd talk and laugh a lot.</p> <p>When we were in bed, I'd grab her from behind and hold on to her shoulders as I fucked her. I used my hands to play with her tits or play with her pussy. She loved it. She loved it when I rubbed her clit or played with her dick. For the past several months we would both be horny and have an orgasm before we even had sex. The last time she'd done that I'd cum in her mouth. She knew I would, although if she swallowed I sure as hell wasn't going to. At first she just sucked me off so long I'd cum on her clothes. But as time went on I was able to get it back, or more and it was even getting a little enjoyable in the bedroom. We still made it into "making love" on "Saturday nights;" I even made her feel like the one. We still enjoyed one another a few times a year, but there were so many times when we were in bed that neither of us knew when to return to bed. There was almost always a "wet" session and that was followed by sex.</p> <p>There was the times where neither of us knew we were supposed to be having sex; our bodies and minds did anything but respond. The "normal" rhythm became the "traditional pattern." There could be a switch-in, for example. Our bodies would change position depending on how much of a particular partner or partner wanted to. We'd make love right after we made love. When we took the first step to intercourse, we'd slow to start with, then gradually build to what we'd been waiting to for all our lives. Sometimes it was on the slowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
