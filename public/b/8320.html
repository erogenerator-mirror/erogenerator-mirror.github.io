He didn't hesitate as he took her hand and placed it on the lump in his pants. The movement brought a gasp from her mouth as her fingers found the ridges of his cock. She was surprised when he didn't back away, letting him lead her, his hand guiding as her head tilted toward it. "I'm your wild man," she told him, her voice husky, throaty, her eyes begging him. He nodded, his hand still on her breast. She squeezed it, pressing it toward his erection as he leaned toward her, lifting her up off the bench as he went. She held his cock with her other hand, feeling it's heat, feeling that it was growing even larger now, pulsing within the confines of her hand.</p> <p>"I have a feeling what this means in two ways," she told them. "The first is I want it in my mouth. I'm going to like it," she told them both. She looked at them as she continued to stroke their stiffened cocks.</p> <p>Suckling their cocks, she stood, reaching to take hold of them with both hands. "I wish there was a way to make that happen," She said. She guided them to the end of the bench, the two men leaning forward while she turned the bench over and over. She moved them down so that the men knelt up on either side while she kneeled down behind them. "My cunt's going to be waiting for it," she said over her shoulder. "It feels so good," she said to them as she parted her legs. "I'm going to make them so happy tonight," she told them as she reached between her legs, grasping both cocks.</p> <p>They were already hard as she guided them, their cocks sliding between her hands. She guided them from the right, slowly, deliberately, letting them go in a trail back and forth along the wet, waiting lips of her cunt before she put them in. "Oh, Jesus!" She said to them as she pushed them back, feeling them both penetrate her wet, tight cunt. "That's it, fuck both," she told them while reaching back to spread a small opening with one hand.</p> <p>"I can't stop it," she told them. She took both cocks into hand and started stroking them both, feeling them slide back and forth in the slick, tight walls of her cunt. "Oh, do it," she told them. She pressed her palms into the bench, bracing herself for the sudden plunge of penetration as the men thrust into her. Feeling the first two cocks push against her cunt, she bent over and took one in her mouth.</p> <p>"That feels so good! Fuck me! Fuck me," she said to them while she pushed her hips back into their dicks, feeling their heat pulse against her. She felt them throbbing inside her, their cocks throbbing, filling her with pleasure as they continued to push into her. She pulled her hands back from the bench and pressed them against her breasts, holding the motion as she fucked them, feeling them pump her, pumping her pussy again and again. The men were not just fucking her, they were fucking her; they were fucking hard, fast, and deep, each one making her feel incredible, as if she were in a kind of endless cycle of sexual ecstasy.</p> <p>"I'm going to come!" she panted, feeling it approaching. The first blast of cum shot out of the heads of the men, landing on her chest and stomach, her hair, dripping. The second blast fell into her open mouth, filling it with his warm, salty man sauce, his own excitement rising.</p> <p>She turned slightly to look at them, their cocks still inside her. "My turn," she told them. She smiled at them as she got on her knees and pushed the bench up, then knelt down as the men thrust their cocks once again into her willing mouth. Her legs spread, feeling the cock sliding in and out of her body, feeling their hardness, and feeling them slide in and out as if they were fucking. She slid her tongue out as she took both cocks in her mouth. They went on, not really stopping, going on forever in their pleasure, until the last spasms of their hard cocks pushed through her lips and coated them with the last drops of cum, then pulled out.</p> <p>"I'll call the guys, I swear!" she said, pulling back. "They just came home," she told them, smiling at them. The men nodded, leaving her on the bench while they took up positions on the bench beside her. She knelt there, the cocks still wet with her mouth, watching the men take their positions on the bench. She turned her full body, so that she was looking over her shoulderâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
