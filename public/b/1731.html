He knew it was not right of him to lie to you. He couldn't lie to you, no matter how hard you tried. She was not a lying woman, but she was a liar. He stood up, turning her around so she was facing away, and his eyes never left her ass. He lifted her up, his hand landing on her butt, her body jerking against his touch. She reached her hands down to his pants, pushing them down.</p> <p>"I know it's unfair of me to try and explain how...how you..." She lowered her head and he smiled. "But, that's just it, I always knew. I never even thought to ask, but then..." He laughed quietly, brushing her hair. "I'm an honest man, so don't try to explain." He shook his head. "I...I just...oh..." Mack sat back, her head still up. "This isn't going to work. This isn't what I meant."</p> <p>"This isn't what I need, man..." she muttered against his shoulder before turning around again in his arms.</p> <p>"This isn't what you need to work for."</p> <p>"I don't want to work for shit..." she said as she grabbed the top of his shirt, pulling it up. She stood him up, letting his shirt fall on the chair. "I need you to work for something, and I need you to take care of yourself." She tugged her shirt into submission and sat back in his lap, pulling him closer. "I really do need a man...and I have a man..."</p> <p>"A good man in bed?" he asked.</p> <p>"Well, of course." Her face fell. "I always thought that you were a good guy, but it always seemed like you were just some big dicked kid."</p> <p>"Is that true?" he asked softly.</p> <p>Her face brightened and her lips parted. "Of course it is." She whispered before pushing him into the chair. "Take care of yourself, Mack."</p> <p>"No more of this nonsense, woman. I only want what you think."</p> <p>"It's not like this is the first time I've seen you take a guy, and I understand." She looked at him over her shoulder. "If I told you tonight that you're not into women, then I'm out of here. No, I don't think we're going with that," she explained as her hand closed over his again. "I don't want to have to explain to your mom that she's always telling you to take care of yourself."</p> <p>Mack smiled as he slid his hand over her hip, pulling her back. "This is all my fault, so don't blame me. You're in love with one of the most beautiful women...you know she's not a good looking woman." He kissed her lips gently. "You don't need to feel bad about getting what you want, as long as you just let it happen."</p> <p>She smiled. "I didn't think I was so easy." She rolled her eyes. "I mean, I had the same problem about your father that I did the first time I had sex with him. That was two years ago." Her face reddened slightly before she looked up at him. "That's exactly what I wanted right then and it worked. Just give me a chance."</p> <p>Mack chuckled. "You know, when I was a teen, I used to think it was just my natural sexual instincts...that this was some kind of an adventure. Just make the time."</p> <p>"What about you?"</p> <p>"Well, we started out just as roommates, and I didn't think there would be any more of the other relationships...you would see."</p> <p>"Well, maybe not more, but I certainly wouldn't want you to have all the details for me."</p> <p>"You're right, Mack," she said with a smile. "I'm just not sure why I still see you as a good guy. You're a nice guy and you let me see a part of you...just not the other part."</p> <p>"Well, then...what the hell are we supposed to say to that?"</p> <p>"Just do what you're told."</p> <p>They sat in front of one another for several minutes. Mack had a strange feeling at her words. "I've kind of felt like this before...sometimes." She pulled away and looked up at him. "I'm a young man of thirty, and I'm kind of in my prime. I'm not in the mood for this..." She pushed her chest forward. "I'm not sure what I'm doing, and it's not right, but it's not cheating."</p> <p>"Just remember, young lovers don't always want their partners to fall inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
