She let go of the mirror and wrapped her hands around his neck.</p> <p>"Let me make that last as long as we can."</p> <p>Denny said as he stood up and started kissing her again.</p> <p>"Let me do the work."</p> <p>Denny worked his way down her neck until he could flick kisses over her collarbone, and she shuddered. As his kisses became more urgent, he reached up and slowly and gently tugged on her hair. With a flick of his fingers, Denny pushed her head towards the mirror, and she leaned up onto her hands as he kissed her full on her mouth again, and again. By this time her breathing had picked up, and his touch had her completely in tune. He finally pulled off the shirt he had been wearing and undid the clasp on her bra and helped the lace off her shoulders. He leaned down, gently kissing her bare shoulder as his hands slid up over her breasts and found the tip of one nipple. He felt her push her pelvis up to him and he started to suck it gently.</p> <p>She responded to the pressure and started moaning his name. The feel of his tongue on her nipple drew her closer to the brink.</p> <p>"Denny, I'm gonna cum, I can't hold back any longer."</p> <p>"Cum with me baby."</p> <p>He could feel her body shuddering. He pulled back and kissed her deeply, teasing her with his stubble of hair. She was almost delirious with pleasure. When he kissed her one more time and she got her hands back over his shirt, he backed away and slid her panties down so that they were halfway to her ankles and tossed them aside.</p> <p>He took Denny by the hand and they staggered to the bed. She had never been fucked without her pants on, let alone without their shoes on while she was fucking him. He got on the bed as she got on her knees and leaned down to kiss him.</p> <p>"Please make love to me. I want to taste you."</p> <p>She straddled his legs, and he reached up to pull her down to him. She got to the tip of his penis and licked up and down along its length. It felt velvety on her tongue. She felt it swell and she knew he was ready. She sat up and kissed right above the tip. It was glistening with her saliva; it looked delicious. She lowered herself again, and started to lightly stroke his shaft while keeping an eye on his face.</p> <p>"I don't want to hurt your feelings."</p> <p>She looked his deep blue eyes, and kissed him full on the mouth. She moved so that her tongue could caress the tip, and then took it under his lips. She pulled it out of his mouth with a 'pop'.</p> <p>"That isn't what I meant when I made love to you, Denny."</p> <p>He didn't know what to say, and then he noticed her breasts rising and falling. She hadn't let it show, but he could see from her face that she was aroused and ready. Her nipples were fully erect, like a couple of little strawberries. She raised her hips, and Denny was treated to another view of her shaved pussy. As he pushed his head under her, she lifted herself in order to take his cock into her. Once she was positioned above him, he looked up at the mirror. She was watching him in the mirror as he was in her. Her breath was ragged, but there was a smile on her lips. She reached out to tug and guide his cock into her. With a slow motion, he entered her until his thighs met hers.</p> <p>"Oh god!"</p> <p>They both gasped. With one last pump, his pubic hair brushed her clit, and then he was in her. They settled into a rhythm. "Are you sure you want to do this Denny?" Denny had just come, but that was it for the moment.</p> <p>"Do you want to feel me inside you Denny?"</p> <p>"Fuck me Denny."</p> <p>He moved his hips forward until his pubic bone rested against hers, and then started to slide in and out of her slowly.</p> <p>"I love your cock."</p> <p>"I love your body."</p> <p>She lifted his head for a kiss and he did too. They lay that way until they both came; and when her orgasm had reached its peak, Denny leaned back and they kissed for a moment. It was beautiful.</p> <p>They cleaned up, and got dressed as her husband drove her home.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I haven't had time to make you a gift this evening."</p> <p>"I understand."</p> <p>"Don't be. You're a big, beautiful, sexy woman."</p> <p>"Thankâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
