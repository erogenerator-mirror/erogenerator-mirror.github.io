My feet were still warm and my hair smelled of flowers and I felt safe. As I said, it was hard to take this new adventure without some kind of protection. We talked more and danced more; it was pretty good for both of us.</p> <p>Then I looked and saw something behind the waterfall. It was a little old, with some sort of glass, but it must have been there before. It was like some sort of stone wall; it must have been about 14 or 15 feet high; some sort of wall? It was about eight feet wide, with a high ledge and some sort of other small trees. I don't know; I just think that whoever was behind it was standing above us for a second as I watched.</p> <p>Then it all came in to life again: a naked man, a man with a big cock, kneeling in front of me, looking down at me, his head bobbing the way it always does when he's horny but he never quite does that. As his hands slipped up my legs, I saw that I wasn't in the water. He was kneeling down in front of my face, leaning back, and I felt some sort of something, like, touching me. I couldn't tell whether it was an ice cube; or maybe even what it resembled or how it started to melt.</p> <p>Then he was doing it more, but it was kind of making me feel a lot different than before. It certainly wasn't the feeling of being touched by a girl or a woman; maybe more of a warm, erotic feeling, like an electric sensation. And it actually felt good. It felt real good.</p> <p>His hands were all over my legs. They didn't touch me all the way up. Then he was rubbing my ass hole. It felt good, but really a little different than the other day when he'd fucked me in the shower. Again he stopped for a second, a little shocked that I was letting him do that and then with a grin, leaned back, putting his cock back between my legs. This time, he began to rub it back and forth. When I stopped him, he got his cock out, turned back around and pressed the head against my lips. One of my legs came up, resting on his shoulder and he rubbed it back and forth. Then his cock just slid in, almost all of it, almost all the way down into me.</p> <p>He stopped again, looking into my eyes, his hands all over me. As he moved, his cock became more and more engorged and I knew he was going to fuck me hard or put his hand in my panties (like he does on most of the girls at the party, anyway) and put his fingers up my pussy. I didn't care. I liked it. I was glad; he just seemed to like doing it and I liked it too. So I had to have him in me, and I didn't care at that point. And as he began to lift his hips into the air, I felt him put his hand in the middle of my back and then felt this pressure at the top of my ass hole. This meant that while he was slowly rubbing my asshole, I was pushing my hips up into him; trying to make his finger go into me. But instead, the more he rotated his hips, the more it came out to slip back between my legs. I didn't care if he came first; I just wanted his cock inside me. And he did. At last.</p> <p>We were lying up on the grass and he rolled a condom on his cock. I didn't know what he was doing, just the feeling of being naked in front of a naked man. He lifted up my legs and pushed them back over and positioned himself. My arms hung over my face and he was holding my knees to pull them back, spreading them, making me feel as if I was a bit of a woman, not a girl, and it was going to be pretty good. Oh, but it was going to be great. And oh, it felt good. He was looking into my eyes with a smile and I felt sure that I had just gotten my first look at sex. That was something else that came to my mind the first time I got fucked. It was the sex talk at school about having sex with a woman, but it wasn't the kind of sex that I had had on some girls' first day at college. And there was a lot to it, wasn't it. It was just like a big black guy's cock; that just fucking went way up inside me and filled my vagina. I felt something.</p> <p>It was his fingers there on my lips, and suddenly I felt myself open up a bit for him. And then he was spreading my pussy lips and pushing a finger right in. I was surprised at how full it felt. I was so slick and wet and turnedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
