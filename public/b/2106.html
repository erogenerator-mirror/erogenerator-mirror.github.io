She lay down in the center of the bed, and I laid down beside her. I pulled back the covers over us, and we snuggled together under them, snuggled in for comfort. Her hand sought out my dick, and it immediately became stiff again, but I didn't feel like I had come yet.</p> <p>"I need one or two," she announced.</p> <p>"Sure, I'm good for one or two," I replied, not wanting to risk missing a bit of fun with the girls tonight, even if it was a little too late.</p> <p>As I rolled away from her, I could hear rustling noises behind me, and, once I was sure she was out, we lay there in bed, just enjoying each others warmth, the sound of it making us both feel better. Then we both fell asleep, both exhausted, but very happy, both knowing there would likely be more fun and games, one with one party.</p> <p>I woke up the next morning. It was around 10:00 with the sun having its way with breakfast, and we were just watching the news.</p> <p>"Last night was great," she said. "I've never been to a party like that before. I hope we can do something. After last night, I don't think I'd be able to."</p> <p>My mind wandered back to earlier when I could tell she was still horny, and her hand between her legs was rubbing a little nub as she slept. She turned over toward me, her arm over me and her other hand rubbing her pussy, then looked up at me. I kissed her cheek.</p> <p>"Do you still have plans for today?" I asked.</p> <p>She turned over and gave me a big kiss. She pushed my hand under her pillow, then grabbed her bra. I reached under her pillow and took her panties, and rolled them up before she had to move to the other side of the bed. We were both naked and covered in our own juices. She rolled on her side so I could see her pussy, and her mouth was still open and she was fingering her clit. With her eyes closed, she gave me a slow lick up and down the middle of my cock. The effect of my own wetness on her face was almost too much. She stopped when the tip touched her mouth.</p> <p>"I want to try something first," she said, with a giggle. "Do you want to watch?"</p> <p>I was not sure how to answer, so I simply nodded. She climbed under the covers with me, with her head propped up by my arm, and I watched as she slowly pulled on one nipple as her tongue flicked over the tip of my cock.</p> <p>She continued to look over at me, her face wet with her own juices. She looked a little embarrassed, but quickly looked away, making eye contact with me, though I think it was a bit of self control.</p> <p>"Well," she announced. "I was just kidding. It's time to do something. What do you think?"</p> <p>"I'd love to," I replied with a smile. "But maybe we should finish our breakfast first."</p> <p>"Yes!" she exclaimed. "We need to take a shower, and you have to wait until you've been completely satisfied before he goes back to bed."</p> <p>"You're probably right," I said. "I don't think your nipples will be the only thing hard this morning."</p> <p>We heard the shower start up upstairs and then the door to the bathroom was closed.</p> <p>I had to go first, or it wouldn't be fun to get it again. Even though I had already had one of my own fantasies, or just two, I wondered if it would be a good idea.</p> <p>So I sat down at the kitchen table and started up a plate of bacon with a side salad. As I served it to her, she sat down between me and my fork. She was still half naked, with one of my shirts on, so her body felt incredibly sexy. She took off the rest of her clothes, and I took off my shirt and shorts, dropping them on the floor.</p> <p>We sat there and finished our meal, talking about nothing important, then I looked at her. My eyes had been on her since the bathroom door opened, but now I didn't want to see them.</p> <p>"Are you going to do anything else this morning?" she finally asked.</p> <p>"I don't know about anything else," I said. "I just like to be on my stomach before I go to the bathroom."</p> <p>"Okay," I added. "It's your turn now."</p> <p>She was naked now, and she lay down beside me, taking myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
