No. Not the door. The door. The door that had just just given me a massive explosion of joy! But the only part of me I had taken from it had been for just a brief moment when I was alone. With no one else in sight. The idea that he was home made me want him so much. And I'd just made a man of him! The idea that he could be my future husband, my father-in-law and my mother-in-law in law.</p> <p>The elevator reached our floor and as soon as the doors opened you were out of the elevator and down a side corridor to the master bedroom. As soon as the door was closed he was behind me, kissing me again. My eyes snapped open as soon as I tasted his lips.</p> <p>This time I just took his hand and placed it on my breast. My lips trembled against his when I felt his fingers slide up to the strap on my negligee. My lips parted instantly.</p> <p>"I think that that night was the most memorable of our lives." He whispered in my ear. I sighed and turned in his arms and kissed him again. "I'm glad that you came back so soon."</p> <p>This time there was no question as to what we were going to do. When I felt his lips on my ear I felt him unzip my negligee and start to stroke my breasts in rhythm with our kisses. As we kissed I felt his hand slide over my stomach and I felt his fingers caress the lips that had once only been mine until now, so very long ago.</p> <p>Our arms stayed wrapped around one another as I gently pushed my breasts against his chest. As I continued kissing him I felt the tip of his erection brushing against my thigh before it slid further between my leg. I was not wearing any panties. I was soaked when he kissed me again. God! I was so excited and wanton!</p> <p>After just a short time, he pulled away and looked me in the eye. "Well? Did you miss me? No, I mean, did you find me appealing?"</p> <p>I was a little startled by this question, but I quickly realized that he must have had to have heard. "I'm sorry, James, I thought that you heard me. You know how I feel when I am with you... I mean with you. That is very rare. But I am not sure that I am going to be able to say yes to you."</p> <p>"Yes, I know what I mean. It was a wonderful experience as it is, and I'm not even sure that I'm ready for anything else." His eyes searched mine, asking me what I had to say, but not sure if I wanted to hear it or not.</p> <p>"Oh, I see." And the look on his face told me that something was wrong. He saw it too and I quickly got an idea that was beginning to show on his face. "You are the most beautiful woman I've ever encountered."</p> <p>I grinned. That really wasn't a lie. He'd had such a special way of making my body respond when a man looked at me. This time was no exception. And I was more than happy to accept it. Even though my mouth had been dry, I felt that I needed to say hello to his beautiful face. "I was just being kind, but I'm not sure how to respond to you."</p> <p>"It didn't seem to bother you then?" He grinned a little wider. "I can understand that. Of course it had been the most sensual experience of my life, but I am willing to put everything else into our future together."</p> <p>I smiled back. "Thank you, that's what I like to hear."</p> <p>By the time we had sat down to dinner we were both tired and we were looking forward to the next two days off. Our meetings were usually scheduled for Friday. But then we'd both get to the house in time for our honeymoon. That was not to say that we didn't have a fun time in our honeymoon plans, but we had to work and our schedule was pretty clear. So we got to the hotel that Saturday afternoon.</p> <p>On that day, we decided to do the honeymoon thing. James drove my car up to the house, while I helped him get the keys for it while we both stood on the front stoop and looked out the small entryway. The view was stunning, even in the low light. I was pleased that we had been able to find a spot in the back garden in a way that not-the-less was close to the house.</p> <p>We had the front door opened and there was nothing that needed to be done. The bedroom had a king-sized four way king sized bed and I had to tell James to sit down to rest for a bit before we startedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
