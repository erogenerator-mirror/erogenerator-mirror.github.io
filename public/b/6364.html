I am going to have someone to play with. I don't want to lose my job or anything!" Her face flushed as she said this.</p> <p>There was no reaction, only silence. I had no idea what to do so I just smiled at her, reached down to cup her left tit, held it away from her body and rolled her nipple between my fingers, gently pulled.</p> <p>She started to say something, but as she did, I lowered my head and kissed her neck. This brought another moan from her lips. Her body started to quiver a little as I kept on stroking her. Finally I whispered into her ear, "I'm not sure what you think I have done wrong, but it's time I made an effort!" With that, I started to remove my clothes as she just lay back against the wall, breathing lightly.</p> <p>I pulled her legs apart, and knelt on the rug between them. I could tell she was more excited than she thought, and before long, I knew she had both hands under her ass, trying to guide me closer to her. I could also tell her pussy juices were running out by now. "Are you ready for me? Do you want me to fill you?" I had never told her this. She didn't look surprised at all.</p> <p>Now I started to tease her. I lowered her legs further apart and held them there. I started to lick from her pussy to her anus, all the way to her clitoris, licking slowly around it. Now her hips were jerking up in the air with each lick. I just kept on licking and licking, getting faster and faster. She was moaning, almost screaming.</p> <p>After a while, I stopped for a minute, pulled up my briefs and knelt on the floor beside her. "Have you ever been with a man before?" I started at this. "Have you ever been with someone like me?" Her face grew redder. I was right! "I haven't, until now. Are you sure you wouldn't like it if I tried to make love to you?" She didn't hesitate. "I just want a chance at a woman, for a start. I think it's safe in that way." And with that, I knelt next to her head. "Is this okay with you, my love?"</p> <p>"Oh, David, yes!" This time she actually started to smile.</p> <p>"Good. Now tell me if it is the 'No Bra' that makes you think I'm serious. It's all okay with me!" I kissed her neck. There was a long pause, as she looked at me. I kissed her lips again, and pushed her up to an upper lip. "I'm just worried that I don't know how much you want me." she said, her lips meeting mine.</p> <p>The kiss was hot, passionate, and a lot of tongue. I pulled away a bit and whispered in her ear, "I thought you wanted me to go slow, but I can be patient."</p> <p>She nodded, then looked at me. "That wasn't so bad!" and she said, "I could feel myself start to get excited! I'm getting so wet that little movement of my hips could give me a crick!" I laughed and said, "You're sure your getting excited?" as I pulled her back for another kiss. She was smiling too.</p> <p>"You're sure? You're going to go for it, now?" I asked, trying to be all reassuring, not at all anxious. She raised her head and looked at me. I kissed her again, then moved to her neck again. She had stopped breathing, only lightly squeezing her arms around my neck, pulling me closer for my kiss. We continued to kiss deeply for a while, holding each other closer to each other. Before long, she grabbed my cock and started stroking it as she spoke to me. "David, are you sure you're not serious about this? This is new to me. I'm not sure if I can do this."</p> <p>"Well, just go with it. I'll watch, I promise!" I could not stop myself as I said this. "No rush." I said. "I am not putting anything on you that you'll feel uncomfortable with, and I will not take anything that you aren't comfortable with. Just go enjoy it, and see what happensâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
