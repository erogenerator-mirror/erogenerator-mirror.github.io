If I come back, I'll catch you, Jim, so you can keep calling me."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, honey. This whole thing was going in one piece. I can't just drop you back at your hotel. Now you have to come to my front door, Jim. We can talk again after we get this shit set-up."</p> <p>"I think I can handle that." My heart sunk, and I took a deep breath. He's such a good man. I'm glad you feel as strongly as I do, too.</p> <p>I made one final check to be sure everything was clean, and hurried home to meet with my husband. As I rang the bell, I couldn't help but to look at the pictures he had sent me. They were very nice and pictures of his nude female body. He kept them in his room, and I had to make sure there were no one else around that I might catch them when I was there. But as I rang his doorbell and saw him sitting on the edge of the bed, I took off my clothes for a second time. That was the first time we had ever made love. I liked it. He really liked it. He said he loved to kiss and touch. I don't know how he was able to have so many fantasies this way. He could tell. It only took me a minute to get ready.</p> <p>His smile lit up his face. "You're not the only one who's never slept with a man," he said with a smile.</p> <p>"No it's not that, it's just not you. I have had too much to drink in the last 12 hours. And, it's probably because we haven't seen each other in a while anyway. This is a wake-up call for me. Maybe now I'll need to think things over when it's nice. Now get dressed and lets have good old hot and heavy sex before we both die of exhaustion."</p> <p>He laughed again. "Yes."</p> <p>He took my right hand in his before he laid me on his bed. I felt his lips on my hand, kissing it, tasting me. Then another kiss on my fingers. A long and slow kiss. As he put his left hand to my shoulder, he began caressing my left cheek. His eyes closed and his lips moved to my neck, where his mouth and tongue had left off earlier that night. He slowly caressed my neck with his mouth to make me feel good. First slowly, then more firmly. I loved the feeling. My body twitched and relaxed as he slowly moved his kisses from my throat, over my collarbone, and to my breasts, caressing and sucking each nipple in turn. He made me feel so good I could barely stand.</p> <p>He took my left breast in his hand and began moving his mouth back from my left nipple. He flicked the bud with his tongue and then took it lightly between his teeth. I could hardly hold back a groan of pleasure. His hand moved to my other breast and he began licking and sucking again. This time he bit me very gently. I was so wet that I could feel the soft skin of my pussy on his fingers. It was very sensitive.</p> <p>"You want it in the ass, don't you baby?" he said, almost in a whisper, a smile on his face.</p> <p>I'd never been fucked in the ass. I'd never tried it and never did. But at that very moment, my body was quivering, tingling, waiting for him. He moved his hands to rest on each side of my waist and looked into my eyes.</p> <p>"You want to try it, baby?" he asked.</p> <p>"Oh yeah," I answered.</p> <p>He moved from my stomach to my legs, placing light kisses on each thigh as he moved his hands up my body. I spread my legs just a little, just enough to rub my pussy a teasing little bit. He made his way to my breasts, which he began to suck and lick. I could feel the wetness in my pussy and it was delicious. He took each nipple between his thumbs and forefingers and began to roll them. As he kept up the sucking, I could feel my pussy pulsing and tingling. When he moved to my pussy, my legs were weak and I knew I was close. He licked across my clit one more time, then began to push two fingers into my pussy, one into my pussy, one into my ass. It felt so good, so damn good. He slowly pumped his fingers in and out of me while he licked and kissed my breasts and stomach.</p> <p>I could feel the building in my body. He had made me cum, twice now, without even touching me.
