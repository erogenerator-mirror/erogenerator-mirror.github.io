He'd gone too far, and with another guy, and a lot of cocksucking. That meant he'd screwed the girls at the gym, but not the cheerleaders or even cheerleaders, as I suspected. It meant he'd fucked someone else, but with an audience, not just me...he'd screwed her too, and then when she'd left. There was just too much at stake by that point.</p> <p>Aroused, I felt a surge of confidence in myself, and I'd been so horny from masturbating, I'd done the deed. But I could still feel that tingling in my hand. As if I'd turned on something to him. Maybe the guilt was all over my mind, too.</p> <p>When he'd gone on to her, she'd said, "No, no, it's all right...don't do that, please, we did it on the bus."</p> <p>The look of horror in her eyes, and when I'd caught her staring at me, with her hands still clamped to her thighs, as if she'd regretted it, had left an indescribably poignant image in my mind. I'd thought he'd been very, very gentle with her, and had kissed her gently, but with such force and fury that I'd never suspected his intent, and yet...his face had gone from a scowl to a look of sheer, rapturous rapture, and I'd felt utterly, utterly aroused. That was the image I'd always cherished.</p> <p>Did his face, when she'd seen me like that...even before that evening? Was that his reaction to her? If only...if only she'd been the one to come back, he'd have been embarrassed and guilty, and he'd had to look away and let her go.</p> <p>He'd looked at her, at me, then, like he was trying to look into my eyes. He'd wanted to say something, something to her, but he didn't, and it surprised me to know he'd thought it would bother her, but he didn't.</p> <p>Hadn't she heard...or at least just assumed that I'd been going out with him, with him? Hadn't she been there, with me...?</p> <p>It couldn't be! He'd been watching me, watching her, as she had seen me...taken pictures, watching me looking at her, with him. How was he going to figure out? How were we going to explain? And I'd have to go to a shrink, and figure out what to do. He could have talked to her, had he not been looking her. My heart would have skipped a beat, he would have known, but my brain hadn't stopped racing, and I was determined to see this through. But couldn't he let her go?</p> <p>I couldn't imagine him being that close. Or that he could ever have. I felt weak and pathetic, but my hands were still locked behind me, on my legs. I'd always believed I was "pretty," but had thought women were much more beautiful, and I was feeling pretty good about myself too, so why should he feel so uncomfortable?</p> <p>"Just take your eyes off me," had said him, suddenly a little louder than I'd intended. He didn't sound like a man of real concern.</p> <p>And he smiled again, and it was as if...as if he felt comfortable with me.</p> <p>He looked like an angel, a God, and his eyes were as bright as the sun.</p> <p>Then I noticed that his gaze was a little wilder, and he seemed a little unsteady. Then I remembered that his hand was still clamped on the button in front, and I realized that he was looking at me, but not at me...at the buttons of my blouse.</p> <p>I knew that I'd given in, and if he thought he'd tricked me, he thought he saw a way out.</p> <p>I put my hands to my face. "Don't touch me, okay? That was a big mistake," I said. "I don't think I'll ever be able to forgive you."</p> <p>I felt his eyes, on me, so close.</p> <p>"You did what you had to. It's going to take him a little help getting over what happened to us," I told him, remembering the guilt that had built up for so long. "You don't have to. But I'll be okay, I know. He's still too young."</p> <p>"No, me either," he said, in a low voice, almost like he didn't want me to hear. "Not like you did, just like you said you would."</p> <p>"I said I didn't think I was good enough," I'd said, in my best little girl voice too, because I could tell that the little girlâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
