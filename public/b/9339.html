"Would you like to stop to get a cup of coffee before you leave?" She turned her head, eyes half-closed, looking back at him through her lashes. "Or could we just take it from there?"</p> <p>"I...I don't know," he said, "I can't really..." He let his words trail off as she looked over at him. Her hair was still damp and her eyes bright and beautiful, her lashes curled and her mouth parted, her body still twitching as she tried to hold back from touching herself. He was about to say something when she spoke again.</p> <p>"Oh, I could do that," she answered, her mouth suddenly still moving.</p> <p>"I don't think I can." She didn't look at him as she took another sip of her coffee and smiled at him. "I think I've been going all day with what I'd just done to you."</p> <p>"How long?" He didn't reply. She looked at his face, the flush burning in her cheeks and the rise in her breasts to the skin on her neck that he had just exposed.</p> <p>"I don't know," she answered weakly.

"I love coffee," she said, trying to think of something to say.</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Yes." She sighed again and leaned further back again, hands reaching up to stroke her skin on her skin. Her nipples hardened and begged to be touched, her hips flexing to push against his, and he didn't respond.</p> <p>"Good," he said softly, his hand now sliding over her back, his fingers sinking deep into her skin. "You're not going to do anything for the coffee."</p> <p>She couldn't help smiling at his comment. "Just some coffee. I have a feeling that I could use one." She let her lower lip tremble from the tension of his callused fingers, his eyes on hers. "I'm going to finish up a few things before we leave." She paused and looked up again, a thin line between them. "Okay.
