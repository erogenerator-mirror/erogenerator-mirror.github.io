But, he was already leaning forward, his face a perfect helmet. He looked down at her ass and began kissing the cheek of her ass.</p> <p>"I like it too and it's better, now you're getting to be more attentive, don't you think?" she said, smiling. And, she got a better response. She turned and presented her ass to him, spreading the cheeks with one hand, and rubbing his face with the other, smearing her ass oil on him. As he stood up, he grabbed her ass with both hands and slid his hard prick to the crack, rubbing the head. With the head of his cock barely inside, she pushed her ass back. His body shuddered and tightened as his body betrayed his arousal. Slowly, he pushed in, making sure not to make too much of a mess. She felt his cock slide along, over her crack, and press deep into her, as she pushed back.</p> <p>"Oh my God," he said as he felt his cock slip deep inside her.</p> <p>"No, wait," she said, holding one foot in a futile attempt to stop him. But, she wanted him right now. She pulled him out of her body, and he stood up, kissing her as he went, leaving her with nothing but empty air. But, she had nothing to give. She turned over, spreading her legs and pressing her dripping pussy to his cock, as she put her arms around his neck to kiss him more. She had never felt this hot before, this intense desire, and she never wanted him to stop. He kissed her neck, and his arms around her waist to hold her. She held onto him tightly and reached down for his cock, squeezing it as it went inside her slick pussy and began to slide in and out.</p> <p>"Oh God," he breathed as he felt her wet pussy wrapped tightly around him. He held himself still inside her, waiting for her to tell him to pull out. She held herself tight against him, holding his weight with her arms around his head. Her legs were pressed against his thighs and her nipples dragged across his chest hairs.</p> <p>His cock, already rock hard and dripping with her wet, throbbing pussy, slid between her legs as she lowered her hands to his ass. He was surprised she didn't try to push him or make him enter. He was surprised when she said, "Oh my God," she said again and again with each word. She was wetter than he had anticipated. He felt as if his body was still being bathed by the warm oil. She wrapped her legs around him, and pulled him toward her as she began fucking herself. He felt her wetness encircle and wrap around him, and she wrapped her legs around his body tightly as she lifted herself so his cock could push slowly inside. She started to slide against him, and she said, "Oh my God," as he continued to pound and stroke into her. His cock was buried in her. She was completely wrapped around him, and only he had left any part of her that wasn't tightly wrapped around him. She continued to moan each time his cock plunged into her. With each thrust, she squeezed him with her wetness, causing him to move in rhythm with her. He was surprised at how quickly she reached orgasm. Finally, she couldn't go on any longer. Her legs gripped him tighter, and she let go a long wail. His hands held onto her ass cheeks to keep his body grounded.</p> <p>"Ohhh," he sighed as she collapsed onto him.</p> <p>"Yes," she said, and they both smiled. They both smiled.</p> <p>"You'll be back," she said.</p> <p>"Yes," he said. "I'll be back."</p> <p>She kissed him again, but this time her tongue was much better. It felt like her tongue was exploring his mouth in it's new place. He didn't remember her tongue in his mouth at the beginning. She broke the kiss with him, then looked him over with a smirk. Her finger moved to her lips. "Just remember," she said, "that this next time, you owe me one." His cock was still at the ready. She could not reach and push him into her. She could only feel like he wanted to go for it.</p> <p>When he returned from the bathroom, she was still on the bed, still naked. As he approached her, she told him to sit down, which he complied. She had one knee bent and the other bent over the opposite foot. She had the pillow to one side of her head as she leaned back. Her tits were in full view, swaying with each breath. She smiled at him, and his cock was starting to get hard. He had been pretty excited watching the movie and could not believe her.
