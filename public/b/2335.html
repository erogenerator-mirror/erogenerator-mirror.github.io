The sight of you in your bathing suit only served to increase my arousal. I had always liked watching someone getting it in the ass, but now it was so much more erotic. The water on the deck, the hot tub filling the entire floor, the look of lust and desire in your eyes and your hands in each other's pussies, the sight of a pussy being stretched by that cock was driving me to the point I could barely sit.</p> <p>You were right, I just hadn't had a good fucking in a while and it seemed to me you could tell. As I got closer to coming I had to stop myself, there was just too much heat for that. I told you I would be back and headed off to the pool with you. We climbed out of the tub and just took turns toweling each other off as I walked you to your car. You started the truck and drove back down.</p> <p>When I got home you were still naked and waiting for me. I told you to wait and take off your bathing suit. When you were gone, I got right to it and you saw that it was soaked through in fact when you got out. I saw your cock and you could tell you were excited. You told me to get in the tub with you, you had a hot tub seat built into an out of the way chair and your feet were on the edge. I climbed in a little bit opposite and you slid into the hot tub as well. Then I lay down on top of you and we kissed as our breathing became heavier. You pulled me back and then you guided my cock into your pussy. It filled your pussy perfectly and I slowly fucked you. We were both ready for each other as I slid out of your pussy, you were so tight and just the warmth of your pussy against my cock and your cock was just as good as I remembered. You pushed your body into mine and we just laid there, enjoying those feelings. I wanted to come again because I wanted it to last as long as it took it to finish this time. After a couple minutes you lifted yourself up on your arms and rested your head on your hand. I had to do something really special while I was deep inside you. You wrapped your arms around my neck and I rolled you over onto your back, my cock sliding out of you as I did so.</p> <p>I started to move up and down in that sweet pussy, pushing into you as I came back down. I didn't want to be gentle because it would hurt a little. But I did get a chance to slide it into your ass while I lay down onto you. It didn't hurt at all, I could feel your pussy clamping down on me as you came back down onto me. Your tits felt so good to hang in the hot tub with only your face on the bench. Your hair was just as wild and wet as it was before. It was all over your body as you came and came until finally you got out onto the deck. You were breathing hard but not as hard as you had earlier.</p> <p>We got out of the tub and dried each other off with towels. I walked you to the door and as I opened it you slipped out. I was in shock as I saw you heading towards the door, your face red with embarrassment and I almost laughed. You were standing in the doorway, your clothes and hair still tousled. I could see you were holding a hand towel in one arm, the other arm folded up against your breast.</p> <p>As you came back in your towel, I just stared. I don't think I've ever seen so beautiful a face. You looked like you were in a daze. I just stood there for a second or two and stared at you as you took the towel and dried yourself. You seemed so shy.</p> <p>We walked back to the living room where I opened up and you sat back into the chair, my cock still in your pussy. You looked up at the clock and saw it was after six. We sat back for five minutes to think about what happened the other night. I could see you were getting a little shy again and decided we might as well go to your room and just sit together, no promises. You seemed to be feeling as shy as I was.</p> <p>I decided that I knew one of us had no right just coming over and having sex as we would never be free again.</p> <p>You were still a little nervous but all I had to do was ask and you were ready for it again. We got up and went into the bedroom. We lay on the bed and you told me to hold you and hold you as you felt the warmth of my body against yours.</p> <p>We lay there together and we took some time to think about how we would get out of this.</p> <p>I took a deep breath and said, "I know this must have been very awkward forâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
