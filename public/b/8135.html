I had gone off to work straight after dinner with a guilty smile on my face. As I entered the room it still had been packed with my work. I looked around as if I didn't care, but when the door to our bedroom opened I froze dead in my tracks.</p> <p>There in front of my eyes, dressed in the same business suit it had been when I had arrived earlier that day, had once a woman. She stood there with a bemused expression on her face. I swallowed and took a step back, but the woman stopped me just out the door.</p> <p>"No, wait," she whispered and quickly turned to leave. "No, wait," she continued, "Please, you're here..."</p> <p>I almost stopped and closed the door. The sight of her standing there with her dress up to her waist and that dress bouncing, barely covering her body, made my heart stop for a moment. But I knew that this was not right and I knew that I had to move.</p> <p>I took a step forward and she looked me over.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I couldn't stand by for a while," I said as I dropped my gaze to the floor and looked up at the sky.</p> <p>"I know, but we need to talk," she continued. "We're done."</p> <p>"I... I guess we have a lot to worry about," I said, and we both broke up laughing.</p> <p>We walked out together back onto the patio and sat drinking our wine. I had no illusions about what we were going to talk about, but it didn't seem to be going to take much effort, if anything. She said that she never had a boyfriend before and never cheated as far as she could tell. Although she admitted that she had fucked a few in the last year and one-half, some how it hadn't affected her relationships, she felt that I was her only love and she loved me too.</p> <p>"So, how do you feel about that?" she asked and reached out with her hand to caress my cheek.</p> <p>"I'm... I'm really sorry," I said and she reached out toward me and pulled me toward her.</p> <p>I was shocked and didn't even manage to get my fingers around to her face.</p> <p>"Sorry for what?" I asked and she drew her thumb across my eyes and down my cheek.</p> <p>"For letting you know that we're not going to be happy," she whispered back. "And even if we do, there's no way any of us will agree if we don't. Now let's move into the bedroom. I'll be your friend and we'll be friends."</p> <p>I let her lead me to the bedroom and told me to strip down to nothing and sit on our bed. She sat on the bed looking at me and I noticed her glance at my bare breasts. I knew that my breasts were really perky and always seemed to get all swollen.</p> <p>I got undressed very fast and took off my bra slowly at first as if nothing had happened. I had already told her of my decision yesterday to wear a bra and now it was a little easier, especially for me. My breasts were not like I remembered them. My areolas were really very pronounced and I looked down and saw that a lot of the flesh had come out of the bra and now the skin was reddened.</p> <p>I quickly pulled the dress off of myself, pulled it on and sat next to her, letting her take hold of my hands. I looked down at her and then looked at her and I saw how much bigger her boobs were and how much fleshier. I loved how much flesh she had and was not disappointed when she started to caress my legs gently.</p> <p>"You're still so beautiful, Kate."</p> <p>I felt her hands slide smoothly up my thighs and felt my arousal and knew that I wasn't going to last long. She took her time touching me and looking at me intently every so often. I felt her tongue lick down into my belly and around the waistline of my panties. When her tongue finally touched my pussy lips I shuddered and tried to pull away.</p> <p>"Let me," she breathed as she took my hands and pulled them behind my back, pulling my hands down and letting me slip them underneath mine and she guided mine to her breasts.</p> <p>I felt my nipples growing hard and I lifted my hips up a bit and she lowered them, feeling my whole body shaking as she touched her nipples and rubbed her breasts along them.</p> <p>"Oh, Kate, I love you," she murmured as I felt her hands slide down my side and start caressing my ass cheeks. I was surprised that a woman, a woman as good looking as she was, could really so much as just touchâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
