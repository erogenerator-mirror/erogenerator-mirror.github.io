She sighed gently and arched her back at his treatment. She spread her knees slightly so that her sex was slightly apart. He looked up at her as he continued lower and smiled, letting his hand slide her underwear down as he got to her ankles.</p> <p>Her eyes widened as she watched him slowly reveal the most beautiful thing she had ever seen. It took both her hands, but she managed to push the material down over the tops of her legs, exposing her body completely. He let it drop to the floor as he lifted her legs up and pulled them apart. He had to pull her legs wide apart to get to it and could barely make them drop as a result. He stared at her body. From his vantage point, she was looking so vulnerable, so exposed that he never wanted to break the spell that was forming between them. He looked back up at the ceiling.</p> <p>"Wow," she whispered.</p> <p>"I can show you a lot about my lovemaking," he said.</p> <p>His head dove under the bedding to meet her and he began kissing the insides of her thighs. He reached one hand up to her sex, but she pushed his hand away.</p> <p>"Why are you doing this?" she asked sternly.</p> <p>His expression was priceless, because she took a moment to look at him with such surprise that he nearly burst out laughing. He leaned back, grinning and continued his treatment.</p> <p>"Well, I'm not sure I can do that. I'm not very experienced, "she smiled. "But, why don't we try it out?"</p> <p>"What do you think I should try?" he asked, his grin returning to his face once again.</p> <p>"Just try, okay?" she said, with a small shiver.</p> <p>Her hands began to slide up her body as he moved slowly down her legs again. She was still trembling slightly, but she took a deep breath and relaxed as his lips and tongue began to roam over her sex. They teased the folds of her delicate flesh, the taste of it lingering on his mouth. He kissed her right knee, then slid them up to her thigh, then he pulled them up to her torso, making her groan beneath him. When his lips brushed against her lips for the first time, and his tongue gently entered her mouth, she was ready. She moaned quietly at his taste and pulled his head to hers. Their mouths pressed into each other, and he felt her tongue slide around inside his mouth before she tasted herself once again. His hands were running over her hips in an effort to make up for his lack of experience kissing a woman like this, but he did not have an answer. He was determined to make this one last. He would make her come, if he knew.</p> <p>His hands pulled up her top to expose her breasts to him as he started to kiss her neck. She moaned softly as he took each nipple into his mouth then, slowly, gently massaging them. She could feel herself getting wet as he took pleasure in the feel of her breasts in his hands and lips. He worked for several minutes trying to bring her to an orgasm, but eventually gave up trying to do that, but he didn't want her to cum this way. He knew she would probably never cum from foreplay, but he wouldn't want to do it. Her hands went to his face, then her fingers entwined into his dark hair, pulling him tighter against her. He could feel her chest move as she pushed against his head, trying to get him to give her release. She held his head, not wanting him to go away. That's when he felt the familiar heat in her hands as she moved her hand down his chest, stroking under his shirt. Once he stopped moving his head back and forth a bit, she continued stroking, tracing the shape on his chest, then moving her hands under his shirt, feeling for the first time that he was hard and throbbing. She slowly pulled her hands away to look at them. She was looking him over, but she still didn't have the courage to say anything. Finally, she nodded her head, giving him permission to speak.</p> <p>"I know," she said softly, "and I know you love me."</p> <p>"I love you too," he replied, his voice slightly husky as he said it. She had the same sentiment. "That makes two of us."</p> <p>"I'm not going to lie, I am scared for you," she said.</p> <p>"We can talk about that when you come back up here," he said, "but I do really loveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
