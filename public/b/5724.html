I was the most dangerous of all to find him when he was alive.</p> <p>I moved toward the bed.</p> <p>"Wait. What am I supposed to do? It's not like...you're still dead...you're..."</p> <p>He was about to say something and I heard the man's voice when his phone rang. He sounded alarmed and I looked up to see him looking back at me and then at the phone. It was not one of our other calls. He said it was for his wife. It was after he hung up. This man was not the first of his people had been dead while he was alive and he had not told me where he was.</p> <p>"Oh," he said as he hung up. "Who was...</p> <p>"I don't know who it was, I just thought it was for my husband. I would say he was supposed to be there with someone, but it is not true...no, he was his own fault. I can understand all this now. Thank you."</p> <p>I looked around again. I was a prisoner at this point, locked away in a strange land I had never even planned to venture beyond as a child. As I stood up I thought of what had happened to our son. As my eyes wandered I saw that we would no longer be here, but would be in different cities for the same days. I took a deep breath.</p> <p>"Will...I...I...I'm sorry, what did you say...what are you doing, why do you do this?"</p> <p>There was a strange tone to his voice which I found strange because in some weird way I now had a suspicion he had been crying a lot. That made me wonder if he had gone to the bar with the man who was at the bar the first time we met.</p> <p>"No, not really. That's for sure, we are not in a public place. I did not want to do what you did, but I'm afraid I'm no longer welcome to hang out here if you're not even aware of me."</p> <p>"But...but we...I loved your father...I really loved his wife...but..."</p> <p>He was silent a while. I was about to ask him more questions when something happened.</p> <p>"Look...let you go...you won't stay here for long. Just leave us. I know you will find somewhere to stay now if you stay; I know that you still find it hard to stay here. You see, when...when I took care of myself in this place I really loved my family and their people and I have to tell you I am sorry. Please leave me."</p> <p>It was clear that this man was feeling something as well. My hope was that this man was sincere, and not just trying to have me leave. I looked through the window at the man's face. I was not blind to the expression he wore, but there was something in his eyes.</p> <p>"So I have to leave," I said. "I am no longer your mother!"</p> <p>"That's right," the man answered, "and if I'm so glad your husband is gone then it isn't the end of the world that matters. You are not some man that you can fall in love with, but you are my son; and I will never forget him. Please say you'll stay with us, and if you come back he'll treat you right...no, we don't have to be here for long..."</p> <p>"But...I could just die right here...</p> <p>"So do. You can do whatever you want to do to make it right. Now go out and see if you can find a job. Or maybe you can come back the next day and start from somewhere else, like my place. What will you find in town when you come back?"</p> <p>I looked at him, at the man who had made me sick before he could speak another word.</p> <p>"There are some jobs in the city," he said. "And the ones where they are better to be hired, are not much worse, but there are some things I don't really like in town. I was really hoping someplace that is not such a dump."</p> <p>"Is that so? Where do you work you little piece of shit?" I yelled at him. "I'll stay with you whatever it takes to make you feel any sort of good. All you need to do is do whatever you want to do. If you want to stay with me then just don't come by the motel again.
