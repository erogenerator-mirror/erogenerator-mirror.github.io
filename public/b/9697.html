"I heard you were upset with us the night before."</p> <p>"I'm fine," she said with a sheepish smile. "I was just a little stressed."</p> <p>Mark turned up the radio until there was just some classical music playing. There was some kind of slow song, he thought to make things awkward, but decided to just turn on the radio and pretend that he was listening to a song from his mom's collection of pop songs. He found the second pop on one of those and turned it on. The first pop played a new record. He turned it on and began tuning for his mother.</p> <p>"Dani is in the office," Kait said after a moment. "She's going to be at a work function soon. Why don't you go get cleaned up and take a nap."</p> <p>He nodded and then headed upstairs.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Kaitlin was on her back in the bath. She had her legs wrapped tight around an outstretched hand as her body relaxed in the comforting warmth. She had her arms over her head to hide her breasts and so far, they were the only thing she could think about. It was getting dark and the soothing sound of jets was soothing against her bare skin had her thinking of those past times with the company of the women at her office. She wasn't the only one who enjoyed that feeling, as it felt like that is what her body was craving and craving her as well. Kaitlin had no intention of doing anything about it, even if she would have the excuse of trying it out.</p> <p>She started to drift off and was startled when her head popped up out of the water, and she looked up just in time to see Kaitling's face. She felt her body flush and her heart stop as all the color drained out of her face. Kaitlin didn't want to come at the sight right away.</p> <p>"Oh," she said after a moment that turned into a moment. "I'm sorry, are you okay?"</p> <p>Kaitlin just shook her head.</p> <p>"Sorry, I'm going to bed now."</p> <p>Kait's smile turned into a frown and then faded. She pulled herself up and went to the bathroom. The water soothed the water out of her and she closed her eyes. She shook her head slowly as her head fell and the feeling started to dissipate. When she opened her eyes, Kait had pulled her in to a hug and a kiss. It wasn't passionate at first but soon after the kiss, Kait's lips parted and she planted a wet warm kiss on her lips.</p> <p>"I'm sorry for what I did," Kait said her lips moving to one of her nipples, which was still erect and rock-hard as her hand came up under her body to rub against the sensitive skin. Her hand went up and down her body as her lips went down to her other breast as an almost electric feeling went through her. It was almost too much for her since she was not expecting to be kissed there. Her fingers were rubbing against her pussy as an idea popped into her head and she took her hands out from under her and grabbed her breasts and squeezed them gently. She was now in the midst of a warm tingling pleasure that had her in a quiver as her eyes closed and her head fell back to let the heat envelop her. She didn't give her body enough time to calm down either then with one last hard squeeze of her breasts, Kait dropped her hand back down onto her pussy and squeezed her hand harder. The feeling was too much for her to bear. Her whole body was shaking as the last of the waves of pleasure rushed through her and she felt like she could throw her head back and cry out if she held it in one hand. Then finally the world came back back to her and she sat there for a moment, taking in what had just happened.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Kait finally lifted her head up from the bed to see Mark lying face up with his eyes closed. She felt a moment of panic at what she had just done but couldn't hold it any longer and leaned over closer to him. She let out a long sigh as she was now on her hands and knees in the middle of the bed with the covers pulled down so that her shoulders were on top of her head.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she said.</p> <p>"Oh, okay." He smiled at her and sat up. He looked down at her as she was lying on her back covered with the covers. "Ready to get some sleep?"</p> <p>"That was amazing."</p> <p>"Yeahâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
