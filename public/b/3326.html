Her breasts didn't need much attention, there were very little to do with the bra but she didn't need to feel ashamed of herself. They were not large but perky and firm, with little sag. They were small - not too small, but not small nor sag at all. Her nipples were the largest that I had ever seen, standing out about an inch from her chest, and as hard as rocks. When she reached back and finished her lotion strip, she turned to the side and rested her hands on the counter, giving him a show of bare skin from behind in her hands. A perfect, firm, tight ass, and her pussy was smooth and hairless. The lips were large and protruded from her lips - even if they didn't stick out at all, they were smooth and very prominent.</p> <p>"You like what you see?" She asked, and when his eyes traveled up her body to her face, he grinned again and nodded. "Well, I think that's enough, and the rest is up to you." She slipped into the front seat of the convertible, and as his cock sprang to attention as he got comfortable, she let it spring out. The first time she had seen him naked, she had been stunned, and now it was apparent that she liked this and so did he.</p> <p>For the next few seconds, she watched as he began to massage the sunscreen into her back up to her shoulders, then down to her breasts. He paused at her breasts, his fingers running over her nipples but not touching them. Then he moved down and massaged the same oil into her lower back, and as his hand rubbed down her lower back, she let him take his time, rubbing his hands over her ass, sliding across her cheeks and around until his fingers touched her asshole.</p> <p>He took off her shorts, and moved his hands back up to her hips as she turned back toward him, then, as he massaged the lotion into her thighs and calves, she spread her legs and pulled him back to her, and he knelt in front of her. One hand stroked the front of her pussy while the other dipped inside. He pulled her hips onto his face, then her legs to his shoulders once she felt his fingers find the little nub at her bottom. He began to rub it between his finger and his thumb, just a little, then harder. His tongue darted out to probe her asshole, lashing it, tasting. When he pushed his tongue inside, she arched her back, and he knew she was ready. He licked a little at the sphincter, and while his thumb stroked her clit, he slipped a couple of his fingers inside. Her ass clenched and his thumb rubbed.</p> <p>Finally, his tongue was moving down her crack, his fingers working in and out and then up the other side. His tongue lapped at her hole as his hands worked her hips and her legs. He teased her ass with one finger as his tongue circled her clit and flicked it.</p> <p>"Oh yes." She was breathing hard now. His mouth and his finger worked at her ass, his thumb working in and out on her clit.</p> <p>Finally, he moved from the backs of her thighs and knelt in front of her face and lifted her leg back so he could work her clit into his mouth, flicking his tongue and nibbling on her clit with his tongue as she came. He held her leg in his hands as she shook and shuddered, shaking and moaning, until she relaxed, her legs coming back to rest on his shoulders, her pussy pressing on his mouth.</p> <p>"That was wonderful," she whispered. "Thank you. You're very kind."</p> <p>"I don't know what your husband has to do with that," he said. "I'm a novice and all that."</p> <p>Her words, and his tongue and hand, were like a jolt of electrical current through her body. She knew he would never leave the inside of her pussy, just one finger would have done. She pulled his hand from her, reached down to stroke his cock, and then she took him back into her mouth, moving up and down on him as his tongue circled her clit. His fingers worked her pussy like he was playing the piano, pulling her lips back and forth with his fingers as she sucked. She could feel him getting harder and harder in her mouth, throbbing against her tongue, his balls rolling.</p> <p>Finally, he pulled out of her mouth. "I'm ready to really fuck you. You're the most perfect thing I ever imagined. I want you on your back now. Let me fuck you - please" and he moved between her legs.</p> <p>She could barely feel him behind her.
