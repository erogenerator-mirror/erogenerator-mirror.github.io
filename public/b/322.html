And I'm guessing you still have a fair amount of your own, I hope."</p> <p>"Oh, and what about you, did you and that cute little sister of yours meet?"</p> <p>"Oh, we went out, you know. She got a ride from one of us down the road," she reminded me. "At the time she had her own car, but we drove the Jeep home, and she was getting her own directions from the driver. Turns out she'd driven a Jeep this way before. That was when we had this really weird moment, we really weren't sure how to approach what we were doing, but we were just out doing it, it happened so fast, like nothing was wrong with that."</p> <p>"I'm not sure," I told her. "We talked some. We still do. That wasn't a good sign. You did, remember? You really did, huh?"</p> <p>"Yeah. It had a really good and amazing time. I can honestly say I've never felt more comfortable here than now. How can I say the same for myself?"</p> <p>"No, you can't. I mean really," she frowned. "I like being here for you, it's great. But the whole time I'm here I've been trying to take your mind off of me."</p> <p>"Well, it's a good job I can't see the other people doing the same thing."</p> <p>"I guess you don't want to just say it." Her voice sounded disappointed.</p> <p>"Yeah. I'm not that much of a judge," I told her. "It doesn't make any difference. They're pretty damn well done there."</p> <p>"I guess that makes sense," she said. "But you're just too good off to give it all up."</p> <p>"Yeah, well, I'm not trying to push your luck."</p> <p>"No, you're more of a man than that."</p> <p>"No," I said firmly. "I'm still trying to let go of everything I'm sure that's in the past."</p> <p>"Yeah." Her voice was tired and tired. "I'm not so sure about that. But I'm happy to have you here. I just don't want to see you get all hurt," she told me with a sad expression, almost pleading.</p> <p>"I'd take that as a compliment," "Is there anything I can do to help?"</p> <p>"I'm not sure really, but just give me a call, okay? I'll call you in a minute."</p> <p>And with that she got up, walked over to her clothes, and left them on a bench, went over to the desk, and leaned over, reached down and picked them up.</p> <p>"I was a bit worried about what she was going to do, but it was fun. I did sort of break the mold. But if you want to hear the rest of the story, hear that our relationship has changed just a little over the last couple of months. It really does, pretty drastically. She actually asked if she could take some time off. She's really, really excited to be doing what she is doing. For some reason she's actually willing to do more if that's what's comfortable for her. She really, really needs to get out of things again."</p> <p>"And you want to go along with that?"</p> <p>"Yeah. I don't want her to be feeling like it's a big deal, like we're married."</p> <p>"You could always stop by the office," she offered. "Then you could get to know her."</p> <p>"It wouldn't really do anything, wouldn't it?"</p> <p>"Don't you think it's better that you know us before she decides whether or not she'll be ready to take a few days off,"</p> <p>"What makes you think we're doing that?" I asked, my mind flashing into that line of thought.</p> <p>"I'm not saying that's a bad thing. It's more than that. And I really don't think you're done. You see we don't talk like that, but as long as she doesn't feel like that you can stop by any time. I think you're doing great. You're just really nice about it. I guess we'll just have to move on."</p> <p>"You think you're good enough though?" I asked.</p> <p>"Definitely."</p> <p>"I can tell."</p> <p>And with that she got up, walked over to the bench, and picked up the pants she'd been wearing, and put them on.</p> <p>"See, I told you she was good," she said and smiled. "See? It's okay. You just have a nice place."</p> <p>She turned around, took my hand and pulled me away from the doorâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
