We both had the same problem: I don't know how I can fix what has happened to me," she responded with an innocent shrug. "I'm not blaming you. I'm just saying that since I've lost that sense of who I am, maybe you could try and find a way to find yourself."</p> <p>She looked down to his face. The look on his face was enough for her to know he was trying to tell her something. "What would..." she said, realizing what she just said.</p> <p>"Letting me help you get through this is something I'll never regret," he said.</p> <p>The look on his face was enough to convince her. It wasn't easy, however. She wanted to stay in control. He was right. He would do anything for her.</p> <p>"No, you can't make me do this. I can't let you do this to me anymore," she said trying to get her voice up so he could listen.</p> <p>"I've spent enough time on my computer talking to different people over the years. I'm not about to be stuck here, especially if they won't believe the things I say in my head." He thought for a second. "Don't I owe you a favor."</p> <p>He gave her a half smile as he walked to her and sat across from her on the bed. She couldn't believe the kindness and kindness he showed her. She hadn't had that much compassion in her life. He told her he had been working so hard and had gotten it right with his wife.</p> <p>"I do know that, because of that, you wouldn't understand the lengths I go to get that done," he told her with a smile that was as sincere as it would be.</p> <p>A look of confusion crossed her face. "What?"</p> <p>"I want you to go through with this. I've wanted you to for some time, ever since we first met. And I want you to help me. You've been so busy that you were so willing to listen to me that I thought I might have a chance. I promise that I'll never look back and I'll never leave you for him, for anything that's yours. I won't let you be afraid of him. I'll be everything to you."</p> <p>She looked at him for a second and then back at him. "Okay," she told him. She knew he meant it and meant it too. She could only hope he had given her his complete backing.</p> <p>She got up from the bed and got her bag off the floor. It didn't seem like she could have made it any faster, however. He followed her up the stairs to the bedroom. Everything she saw he did. He looked at her and told her that nothing was going to change, that he'd done everything he could to make it happen for them. Her heart started to pound as she listened to his words. It wasn't easy, either. He would never leave her.</p> <p>He gently set her down on the edge of the bed. "I want you to go do this for me. I don't have long. I want you to know that. Let me know if anything happens from here. I can do this for you."</p> <p>She stared down at him as he talked. She loved hearing his words. It reminded her of her husband, the wonderful, loving husband who still loved her. She stared back down into his eyes. He was so strong, she thought. That is the only reason she trusted him. She knew that, because he talked about that.</p> <p>"I'll be gone by the time I get back, but we're both going to have to talk about this. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."</p> <p>"I told you we should take it slow. Trust me, it'll be ok."</p> <p>She nodded her head with a smile as she left the bedroom. She didn't know what she was feeling, but wasn't looking forward to seeing her husband again. She didn't know how to deal with this. She couldn't allow him to leave her, for even if he wanted to, she was married. What do you do?</p> <p>"It's just going to take more time. I promise," she said, trying to keep her voice from wavering.</p> <p>He just nodded again, still smiling. She wanted him to leave. What had she done? Would she ever see him again? It couldn't be right. She had to break things off with him before he left. She wanted him to leave so they could live together.</p> <p>She felt anger build inside of her as she walked into the bedroom and sat down next to him. She wasn't sure how to do this. But all of her doubts gave way to a new determination, one that she hadn'tâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
