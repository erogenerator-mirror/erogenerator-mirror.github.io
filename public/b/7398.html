Their eyes were so alike that he couldn't have been more surprised. He had never known it to be possible to look at her in the same way. He had no idea this was her and he was not going to let this opportunity pass by. He leaned down and took her lips in his. He let his tongue snake into her mouth and it played across her teeth and lips. Her whole body was tingling but she didn't care.</p> <p>Their bodies were so close, no matter where they were. Now, they were alone in her apartment which was across the street. Her heart was pounding and it felt like it might burst as they kissed. This was beyond what she had ever imagined. In all her dreams, it never had been this good. She held back from wrapping her legs around him and her hands went all over. Her hands had always been too small, even for him. Now, he held her in front of him.</p> <p>He was so nervous that he would break the kiss to find how deep their chests were touching. She didn't let him break the kiss. He reached up and held her face with the back of his hand, letting their tongues play against each other. He moved closer to her because he wanted her to know that he was hers. Her lips parted and his tongue explored her mouth, gently probing with her tongue.</p> <p>He broke the kiss when his hands wandered over her shoulders and onto her firm breasts. He could feel her nipples tightening beneath his palms. He squeezed and rolled them between his fingers, watching her reaction with a wide smile on his face. She seemed to like it though. She smiled and leaned back against the couch. Her breasts bounced in time to his ministrations. He gently pushed her bra straps and it slid off of her shoulders. Her arms fell to her sides and he slid her white shirt underneath her blouse. It dropped to the carpet and he ran his hands over her breasts, making them bounce and jiggle. She leaned against the couch back as he dropped his head to engulf one of her nipples. She gasped and moaned as his lips moved from one breast to the other, sucking and nibbling her sweet flesh.</p> <p>She leaned back against the couch again and he reached to undo her skirt. When it dropped to her feet, still clad in only her black satin panties and lacy bra, they were just above her feet. They fell to the floor, leaving her naked except for her shoes. She stepped out of them and he looked up at her, kneeling in front of her. He watched her as she unbuckled his belt and slipped his pants and boxers down to his knees. He was as erect as she was. Her hands caressed his shaft, stroking and rubbing its head. He reached out to feel her breasts, running his fingertips over her nipples and making them stand out. He had always fantasized of making love to another girl but it felt too weird doing this to her. He couldn't believe this was his first time either but, he knew it couldn't be anything to be thinking about. It would be too hard going through all that embarrassment and too soon.</p> <p>Her mouth felt fantastic on him. He leaned into her, letting his weight rest on her shoulder.</p> <p>"Kiss me, please?" he whispered to her.</p> <p>She obliged and kissed him tenderly on the lips and then on the jawline as his hands gently played with her breasts. Her back against the couch, he had never felt that kind of sensation so good. His hand slid down to her mound, dipping into the moist center of her to tease her clit. She moaned against his mouth as she felt his fingers working their magic. "Oh god," she gasped as his fingers slipped inside of her. He found the hood they were seeking and his thumb grazed over it. Oh, yes! he whispered. She tasted good. That sexy cherry cherry. His hand moved from her breast upward, cupping her cheek with his other hand. She kissed his chin and her jaw, his neck and down to his chest. His heart was beating faster now. His hips were thrusting into her thigh where they could be met with more of the silky fabric of her panties as they rubbed against his erection. Her hands were moving up and down over his hips. He could feel her knuckles against his thighs as they slid over his skin and he knew she could feel his hardness and it was pressed into her.</p> <p>"I want you on your back, on your back," she said softly.</p> <p>He obliged. Her legs moved across his own on her knees and she sat up on top of him. They kissed again, their mouths opening and closing as their passionsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
