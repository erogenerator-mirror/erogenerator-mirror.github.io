And they could feel the heat of his heart on her skin, his breath on her neck, whispering into her hair as he strode towards them.</p> <p>"Take off your clothes then."</p> <p>She didn't hesitate or object. It was her idea. She was so used to obeying him. And he looked so fucking gorgeous that even in the heat of the moment she still wanted to take the lead. Her eyes flicked to his dick as she moved. It looked so big again, too large to hang on too much, but she wanted to feel it inside her.</p> <p>She did. And it was long and thick. And still she stroked. He stood, still looking over her as she stroked him. He was still hard and throbbing, and she knew she couldn't even get more excited if she didn't touch herself.</p> <p>He stepped forwards. She looked around at the large open space and, before she could register what was happening, she felt the cool air on her face. He turned her around so she was facing him again. The feeling of arousal, of desire, it was like a million feelings, a thousand different sensations that rushed through her as he reached towards her, and touched her.</p> <p>He was hot and heavy, and everything was slick and wet and he pushed into her quickly. He pushed himself inside, deeper than she had anticipated, feeling the softness of her body, the warmth and wetness. He gripped her hips tightly. She didn't have much in the frame. She was a little taller. And he didn't just fit into her. He moved his hands down to her waist, grabbed her ass cheeks and gripped her in his hands, spreading them and pressing her pussy around him. His hard dick was so hard and warm, she thought she might get sick of not even feeling it at all. It felt so good inside her.</p> <p>She felt something warm and soft on her ass hole. It felt like his finger, and she could feel his weight. His dick pressing against her other hole, then up towards her lips, all at the same time. She couldn't move. Not just yet, not for as long as they'd have to wait. She felt a hand move from her hip and grip her nipple. Then move up between her legs and start to rub against her pussy lips and her ass hole. His dick was inside her so very hard, and she couldn't even feel him against her.</p> <p>His hips continued to piston up into her as his finger rubbed against her ass hole, and then he slid both fingers up to her pussy lips, rubbing the wetness against them, pressing against them with his fingers. She moaned.</p> <p>"Take off your jeans."</p> <p>She wasn't about to. He took the lead, and she took him. She pulled down her jeans, her bare ass exposed. The skirt rode down over one of her cheeks and up her body, revealing she wore no panties. Her body felt so good. And then he reached up, cupped her ass cheek and lifted her up again. She felt so wet she was almost sure his fingers were sliding between her lips. The hand he had on her ass had made a slippery wet mess of her and she wanted to feel it. She wanted to feel his fingers inside her, spreading her, filling her, but he wasn't letting her.</p> <p>And he held her. And his dick was still inside her. His hands slid down her body, to her tits, circling her nipples with his fingers, rubbing her. His dick was still inside her, but she heard him moan.</p> <p>"Take off your shirt," he whispered in her ear, and she complied. She felt something warm and wet touch her other nipple, the fingers that now rubbed her pussy lips. She felt his hand on her tits, sliding back and forth. She thought she could feel that warm and hard thing against her ass and up against her mouth. He had positioned himself so far up her body that she could feel the heat there, though the skin was so tight and sensitive, and that pressure felt like nothing she'd ever felt before. She felt that wetness against her lips again. She let it slide into her mouth and sucked.</p> <p>The fingers he'd had in her mouth rubbed and pressed down onto her tongue on every stroke, and inside of her mouth and her nose that he took to his fingers when he would slide out, and she could smell her own scent on his fingers and his hand. She knew they were coming in her mouth. She was glad he didn't have a condom. He moved his dick out of her and then put his weight on one arm under hers, gripping her ass cheeks with his fingers. She felt his cock touch against her, the head just inside her lips, then push back into her. She felt the pressure of it. He was still holding her tits and sliding his fingers up onto her assâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
