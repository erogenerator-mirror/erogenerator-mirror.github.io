I said sadly.</p> <p>I went to my room while they watched television. They had gone and were probably still in bed, so I stayed awake and checked on them. The television had all gone for the night. I tried not to sleep after the night before and wanted to sleep until morning, but was afraid I'd wake them at work.</p> <p>I woke to an alarm on my bed. It was 7am and I could hear voices coming from the next room. My mind was all over the room. I got up and started looking over the notes from yesterday. My mind would wander away from my current situation.</p> <p>What I had done for myself to earn some money was an act of charity. I had tried so hard to be a good man. I had always acted more self-confident and self-assured when I was alone. This was the result of my lack of self-confidence and lack of a good job. This thought of me acting like a slut for money was my reflection in the mirror. As I stood in the door, thinking about my behavior, I felt like a total whore. It was an incredible sensation in having that freedom. I couldn't help myself from sneaking a little look at the notes. There were two of them. I couldn't find anything that I really didn't want to know.</p> <p>I had already made it to work the next day at 6am; I was exhausted. It had been a busy day. I just didn't have much time left. I went over the notes that were being written to me so I could decide how I wanted to do it. I knew that if I tried to get a job, I wouldn't be able to.</p> <p>On the way home, I thought about the papers. I knew some of them were good so I was looking for a job to get my job done before noon. If my work was right, would I work at it again. But this job meant a lot to me. At just 25, I was only 20 and was pretty easy to get to. It also meant that I was the only one at home. I wanted to impress my co-worker the way they always used me.</p> <p>At my friend's place, I decided to talk to him. I had a lot of questions to ask him but he was pretty clueless.</p> <p>********</p> <p>The next morning I showed up at 8am. My plan wasn't to go to work, but I'd go to the shop for lunch. I left a bottle of wine for us to have. As I was heading upstairs, I heard a knock on the door.</p> <p>"What's wrong sweetie?" I heard in my voice.</p> <p>"It's me!" I said. "Shit its Mark. I'm coming home."</p> <p>"OK" I said. "When are you going to tell your girlfriend that I got you to do some work?"</p> <p>"When I get my job," he said.</p> <p>"Yes" I said. "When do you leave?"</p> <p>"Monday," he said and I heard him leave.</p> <p>I closed my eyes for a few minutes and thought about his letter and what they implied. How could I not tell him what I really wanted to do now?</p> <p>********</p> <p>For the next 3 months, I did a lot of work at home. We talked many times all week, but I couldn't keep the silence. I started to get upset that I could never get a job and that I didn't deserve someone like Mark, who I didn't see as much as he wanted me to. He always thought that he would have me, but I could never trust him.</p> <p>One day, Mark came to my room. I could see him through the little hole in my closet I had. The wall was high and I could see a large hole. I knew what he used to look like. He looked very young, maybe in his early 20s. He was a pretty slender guy, just starting to fill out a bit.</p> <p>I knew that he had been married for 10 years. My first thought was that he was my husband. My second thought was that he was going to cheat on me. I told him about the other mail, but he never did it.</p> <p>We started dating and the sex was incredible. I would get mad every time he would put it in my hand on a busy day so that I could tell him that it was for his own good. The way he would tease me with a wad of money had just become an everyday thing for him.</p> <p>He would say things like, "You know how to use my big dong."</p> <p>I loved being his boss. It meant that I had been taking care of a lot of things for him.</p> <p>********</p> <p>One day when he was at work, Mark met me at theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
