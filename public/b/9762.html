I'm trying to help," I said. She smiled and pulled me to my feet by my cock.</p> <p>"We will get back to that later. But right now, what I want to do before I let you cum is the three of us, me in front . . ." she said, grinning as I slid my middle finger into her slit.</p> <p>"I can see that," I said, as I pulled the head of my erection between her outer lips and nudged it up into the opening to her pussy.</p> <p>"Ooooooooohhh God, yes." She moaned as I slowly pushed my cock into her, pulling the foreskin back on me as I did. She sighed happily then pushed her hips back at me, trying to get more orifice of herself on me.</p> <p>I kept pumping her pussy, feeling her body as I reached up and felt her breast, as she rubbed the nipple on her other hand, pinching it. I felt my cock surge from her, as my hand shot up to squeeze it. "Oooooooohhhhhh" she moaned, her hand on top of mine holding it up and down, as I released it onto her other breast.</p> <p>She was panting, "Mr. Reed!" as she continued to ride me. I was just about ready to shoot as the pressure in my balls grew. She was really pushing herself back at me, trying to get more of me into her. I started stroking into her, slowly, but the feeling was incredible.</p> <p>She kept humping and humping me, as my cock was sliding in and out of her. She started kissing me passionately, her eyes were closed. I could feel her hand working on my cock, as she squeezed and rubbed me, driving me wild. My penis was being pumped in and out of her as she humped herself back against me and kissed me deeply. It felt so fucking good – our bodies sliding together and kissing deeply. She kept moving her hips again and again, almost taking me to the brink, but not quite.</p> <p>"Aaahhhhhhhhh!" she gasped, "This is amazing! You feel incredible!" I grabbed her hips in my right hand as I pumped myself into her. I could feel myself pumping my semen into her, with her humping against me faster, harder. "I'm cumming!" I called out as I pumped myself into her. The feeling of it was unbelievable as I felt the hot liquid shoot between us through our bodies, filling up her with it. I pulled back, as it shot out of her, leaving only her inner thighs to wrap themselves around me, as our juices mingled. After we relaxed a bit, both of us leaned back against the desk.</p> <p>We sat there for a while after we had all the juice off of us and I was still breathing hard and gasping. I was still trying to catch my breath. She finally said, "Mr. Reed, I think that was fantastic. . . and I am so lucky to have you back." She leaned forward and kissed me. I could taste my own semen on her tongue. She kissed me again and kissed me again, "I have loved you for so long. Thank you for all your kindness and kindness." She looked at me and said, "Don't let him know it was all his fault. He knows that. . . I would never do anything to hurt you." She smiled, turned and kissed me again before she left to do the final things of the interview - get into a hotel room and make up for the past few months—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
