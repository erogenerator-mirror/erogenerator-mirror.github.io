A little bit of an adjustment."</p> <p>"O.K. If it's what you think, how about you have an old friend who was a real sweetheart for me, not a little old fangirl, in her late sixties, who is so well built like I am, like I am."</p> <p>"O.K. I just assumed they were both still having hot, erotic sessions, not with each other. Anyway, the problem is not so far gone that you and I don't have time for that."</p> <p>"You want me to find a real friend?"</p> <p>"No, it's only temporary, but that wouldn't be right, wouldn't it, anyway. I'm not getting married. I want you both to stay friends, no matter what."</p> <p>"Oh! Okay, I'll let you go. I don't want our sex life back to all that I did with my husband. We can still do what we do because you're still in good physical shape at the rate you two are developing."</p> <p>"That's the thought. He'd say we didn't do enough."</p> <p>"Oh, are you saying we should stay friends?"</p> <p>"Well, I am."</p> <p>I grinned knowingly. "And what would we have if I made the decision I have? If I gave a real friend a chance, you'd have another.</p> <p>He just smiled.</p> <p>We didn't have an immediate answer and decided to stay in bed, and that's all that the conversation we had before that day had left.</p> <p>He was asleep when I woke him up. I was on my side and he was on my stomach. I'm not sure how I got into it but I was in bed with him. His hand gently held my face and we kissed, softly, and then we kissed some more until we were both hot again, then I had to tell him I was a little sore from the two nights I had spent with him.</p> <p>He held me and said, "I thought it might turn us both on if I told you that I am a good lover."</p> <p>I couldn't believe it. Yes, he was. "Oh, no, that wouldn't be right. I think you need to tell me everything."</p> <p>He smiled and he knew that I'd be able to hear everything. "When a woman starts to tell me everything, she wants it all."</p> <p>I kissed him so softly that my lips were just coming off my face. He laughed. "Tell me everything, and I'll tell you."</p> <p>He put a finger to my lips to stop me.</p> <p>"Please. I want to talk to you and say it, like I am a true man. I want to tell you everything. No secrets, no promises."</p> <p>A week after my return, I received the first of the cards from my son. I asked him, "What did you say?'</p> <p>"The card said, 'Tell me everything'. "</p> <p>My heart sank. "What are you talking about? What if my son doesn't come home early enough to tell me all?"</p> <p>"He won't."</p> <p>I was shaking, I couldn't bear it.</p> <p>He said, "We can't go home with him. We still have plenty of time. So we'll just have to be careful."</p> <p>"He is our son."</p> <p>"He's your son."</p> <p>"It's just that I don't like what I see when I look at him."</p> <p>"He sees me as pretty but not in a bad way; and he doesn't see that I'm ugly. We all still need to keep it nice and just between us."</p> <p>"I don't know about that either. But it's nice to know that he has other things he wants to do with me than he does. And that we can do what we do, because there's nothing else we do that is wrong. Why don't you tell me what it is that you want in a lover?"</p> <p>My son was so sweet and gentle that he couldn't possibly hate or despise me, as he did mine. What I wanted was to be friends and just keep it all up as long as we were in the right place and time. I was afraid he'd just hate me, but I didn't think that would be a bad thing.</p> <p>That night, after my son had gone to bed, I thought about him. Could I really love him? Wasn't he supposed to be my son? He wasn't just some kid that I was having sex with, even though I knew he was, on the whole, a decent kid. He didn't look like that kid. That I'm sure he was.</p> <p>I found a wayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
