I asked myself. "The hell with that and fuck it!" I went down on my knees and put the condom in and put her back in position and started to pump it in and out of her pussy.</p> <p>That brought another groan, "Faster! faster!" from her.</p> <p>As I pumped my cock in and out she started to come and just like that, my hands were all over her breasts and pussy too.</p> <p>"Oh shit, I'm cumming!" she screamed "A lot!"</p> <p>We lay there for a minute or two and then she rolled up on her side. She gave me a kiss and said, "Thanks for a long hard day, I needed that."</p> <p>"I'm glad I could help with that!" I said</p> <p>"You have a fantastic cock," She said "It was better than all the porn I have been watching on the internet."</p> <p>We laid there and talked for a while longer about the day, about my week, if we had time. I asked her what her day was like and she said she had no sex for the past three weeks.</p> <p>"Do you have to go back to work tomorrow?" I asked.</p> <p>"No, I've taken all of Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, not to mention the rest of the weekend. My boyfriend and we want to watch some movies on his computer so we should be able to get started early by dinner."</p> <p>"Okay, I can't argue with that." I said.</p> <p>"Do go, it's really great to have some time with you."</p> <p>After a few more minutes, she said, "I'm pretty exhausted anyway we haven't got all night. I better go get cleaned up and get dressed. Can I get on with my day so we can have some company while we have a few days together?"</p> <p>"It's fine with me. I'll call you tomorrow and we can set up a date then."</p> <p>"Tomorrow then, bye." She said with a wink and then she got up off the bed.</p> <p>When I was on my feet, she told me to get undressed and get to bed. "Your first lesson? Take all your clothes off and lie on the bed."</p> <p>"Okay." I said.</p> <p>She told me to get on the bed on my back. I was surprised. I was naked lying on my back and my cock started to rise again.</p> <p>"You can do whatever you'd like to me this time." She whispered in my ear.</p> <p>'Just make me as comfortable as possible." I responded with a bit of a grin.</p> <p>"I really like that," she said with a giggle while she was opening my legs and moving her hands over my body.</p> <p>"You have a beautiful body," She said with a wink and went over and got in front of me and started to rub my shoulders.</p> <p>"If I can't have a massage, I can at least have a good fucking!" She said while lightly running her hands over my chest again. She kissed me on the mouth before telling me to move my arms up the bed and lay down.</p> <p>I slid to the middle of the bed, facing the head. She kissed my back while she massaged my shoulders and arms.</p> <p>She turned around and lay down on my left side facing me.</p> <p>"Please move your body down a bit." She said while I kept moving to the right sides of my body.</p> <p>She looked over her shoulder at me and said, "Do some other relaxing exercises."</p> <p>"Oh okay." I replied.</p> <p>She turned around again facing me face to face and moved herself down to my legs.</p> <p>"Move your legs up and down." She said. "Just hold your legs in the air so we can get to it okay."</p> <p>She got up into a kneeling position between my legs and started to rub her hands up and down my legs. My balls were hanging below the head of my cock and it was moving back and forth while my face was getting turned on by the feelings she was giving me.</p> <p>"Keep getting on and on about that." She said rubbing each leg all over.</p> <p>It was becoming hard not to moan while she was pleasuring me. She rubbed up and down a couple of times before she leaned forward and kissed my left ear lobe.</p> <p>"You're a natural." She said with a wink.</p> <p>She rubbed my right leg up and down again before she started to kiss my left ear lobe. It really turned me on. She was really getting intoâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
