I said as he quickly reached between my legs. His fingers touched my pussy and I tensed and let out a slight gasp. "It's my fault you're a virgin!" I snapped. To my relief it was not an accusation.</p> <p>He laughed and looked at me. "Of course you are," he said. His hand moved away from me to brush my cheek.</p> <p>"Now if I'm that bad, who am I to let you get away with fucking the living shit out of me?" I said, my own face still turning reddening from my anger. His hand dropped to my thigh and slid under my dress. He lifted me up in his arms and carried my still cold body down the hall to my bedroom.</p> <p>"Let's go make up that bed!" I said, dragging as he stood me in the middle of our room. A few minutes later he was holding the small vanity table and a small tub was the only thing I made in the house. "Get undressed and get in the tub," I said in a harsh tone as he was standing above me.</p> <p>"I want you to make it!" he pleaded, looking down at his hand covering his cock as he stood. I lifted my hands to his shirt and pulled both buttons open. Reaching around his waist I held his shirt up and ran my fingers over his pecs, feeling the ridges of his pecs on my fingertips. He looked me up and down, and I noticed his dick was stiff in his pants and straining against the zipper.</p> <p>"Not the tub yet." I said, dragging the shirt from his torso. I ran my hands over his chest, sliding my fingers beneath the band of his shorts and pulling them down. I pulled his shorts off with the rest of his clothes, kicking them off the pile. His erection sprang out, bobbing in the tub.</p> <p>I wrapped my hand around the shaft and began to massage its length with one hand, rubbing the head in small circles. I moved the head in circles with my thumb and fingers, and I heard his breath quicken as I did so. "Stroke it," I said. His cock was slick with droplets of pre-cum as his hand stroked it.</p> <p>"Your mother and I make this pretty hard, and I didn't want you to miss out on a thing you missed so much," I said, standing above him as he stroked his cock. I bent over him, my arms folded across his chest as he kneaded my breasts with his hands. I moved the head of his cock between my lips and brought it back, letting the wet tip rub against my aching clit. I could feel his body begin to tense, anticipating the explosion of his come into me. Suddenly I felt it, and just before I would have plunged his cock deep into my pussy and sent him into orbit, I pulled up and stood on my toes. His dick jerked in his hand as he continued to rub the swollen head against my clit, rubbing it with light strokes.</p> <p>"Fuck me," I said, and he rose to his feet. His cock was throbbing, and I reached out and wrapped my hand around it, but I didn't jerk it, just held it to my pussy. "Do it," I said, pulling on his balls and stroking it lightly as my second orgasm came. He leaned down to kiss me, and his cock throbbed in my hand, almost as deep as a soda can. He pulled me against him and ran his hand up and down my thighs and over my ass cheeks before leaning back on the tub's surface. "Ohh fuck, I want it all!" he gasped.</p> <p>"Good boy," I said. "You're going to make the queen of sex very happy." I stepped forward to press my body against his, and I pulled my top up in one slow movement, letting him see the fullness of my breasts as my nipple puckered. With both hands I pulled his shorts and underwear off in one slow motion. There was still cum on them, but that was not a problem. I dropped to my knees and pulled his cock toward my lips. The head looked angry in front of me, and my eyes grew even bigger as it brushed against the soft tissue of my lips. I lowered my mouth and tasted the saltiness of his pre-come. I was surprised. I loved the flavor; it was like no sweet taste I had ever been aware of before.</p> <p>"Oh damn, you taste good, girl," he said. He pushed one hand between us, gripping my neck to tilt my head forward while he thrust his hips up. He entered my mouth in a way I've only dreamed about and I felt my body respond with the same urgency as it had earlier.
