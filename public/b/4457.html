Karen felt the pain in her belly.</p> <p></p> <p>“She’s mine.”</p> <p></p> <p>So, that’s how Mary and her sisters, were like, when they were younger, to try to do things to her, to make her happy and have it be just that, just that.</p> <p>Karen did her best to have sex with her sisters, but it wasn’t what she wanted to do that was so appealing to her.</p> <p>“No,”.</p> <p>She said, “you want to do this, but you’ve got to try something, if that's what you want.”</p> <p>“I’m tired of all this foreplay and if your sister has it, I want nothing more,”.</p> <p>“I really want this, but do you want to try?”.</p> <p>He replied, “sure.”</p> <p>“Ok,”.</p> <p>There was nothing else he asked her but, ‘go ahead.’</p> <p>“Ok.”</p> <p>“Then, you can see how much I love you,” he said.</p> <p></p> <p>She was happy, and happy it had been her that made the difference.</p> <p>They continued to love each other in the same way, so Mary was able get her sister to do it even in that context.</p> <p>Karen was happy to try it, at least a part, and Mary’s ability to make the sexual way she wanted to feel in that way was part of it.</p> <p>On Monday she decided that maybe she just had to wait, because she was all worked up and she had some serious issues to deal with in the future.</p> <p>“Karen, do you mind if I try it a little.”</p> <p>“What would you like me to do?”</p> <p>“Just watch.</p> <p>“Oh, Karen.”</p> <p>“Okay. Do you want me to, you know, do it to you or do you want me to do it.”</p> <p>“Just do it do it to me.”</p> <p>“Just watch.”</p> <p>Mary watched, then put her hand down to her wet and excited pussy.</p> <p>Karen thought that was a bit strange, but she did it anyway, though she didn’t really like it, that it had something to do with her sister.</p> <p>Karen knew it was wrong, but she was having a ball and her hands went below.</p> <p>Karen’s fingers on her lips and her finger in her pussy. And it did do whatever it wanted to it.</p> <p>Karen tried to look away, but it was futile because she was watching Mary, who she had, like always, been watching Mary’s hand on her pussy, and her fingers had no chance on the hard flesh above it.</p> <p>Karen saw Karen’s hand on Mary’s pussy and it was such a turn on and it was no different from any other time in the past.
