I said.</p> <p>"You see, I'm the one making it." As if in answer her hand started to rub her clit in slow circles. "Yes, yes, yes, baby."</p> <p>I had to force a smile as her hand started to move up and down her clit and her breathing picked up. I heard her moan very softly. I reached between her legs and touched my finger to a puckered spot.</p> <p>"God, I think I'm going to cum." She said. I pulled my middle fingers away from her entrance. I looked at her and she looked at me curiously. I continued to caress her clit.</p> <p>"Would you like to cum first?" I asked. "I'd love it." She nodded.</p> <p>I turned her to face me again and kissed her on the cheek and then her lips. My finger kept rubbing her clit but I couldn't quite bring myself to touch her nipples.</p> <p>"Oh, my." she was out of breath and panting. She turned and looked at me.</p> <p>"It's yours. I promise." I said. I turned her a little more and placed a third finger into her sex and she quickly started moving. But I stopped her. "I need to go do something for you."</p> <p>"I'm ok. Take your time."</p> <p>I turned her back around and she held me as if we were lovers. I felt her hands slide down from my shoulders, to my arms and back up to my shoulders as we embraced. I knew what was coming and I felt her wetness on my thigh and she wrapped her arms around me.</p> <p>"Oh, Chris. Yes." she whispered as I kissed her neck.</p> <p>"I love you too." I whispered to her. She smiled. "I love you too."</p> <p>We lay kissing on the bed for what seemed like a long time. I ran my hands through her hair feeling her wetness on my thigh; I reached in between her legs feeling her sex and she opened to meet my fingers as soon as she felt the lips of her pussy. I took them out slowly as she continued to moan with my hand touching her; she was so wet. She pulled her hands off my shoulders so I caressed her breasts feeling her nipples.</p> <p>"Oh, Chris." she said. I felt her fingers caressing my chest as her hips moved in time to my fingers as she rubbed herself.</p> <p>I pushed her onto her back.</p> <p>"You have beautiful breasts." I told her. I kissed down her chest, her stomach, and then stopped at her pussy. My fingers played in her dampness feeling the lips of her sex. She moaned and her body moved underneath me. Her hands touched my face as she leaned on the pillow.</p> <p>"You're so wet." I said. "I can't believe how hot you feel."</p> <p>I reached up and kissed the area between her breast where her nipples were visible. I leaned and licked her nipple. She moaned and then pressed herself against my mouth. I started licking and sucking her nipple between my lips, as I cupped her other breast and ran my thumb over her hard nipple. I gently sucked until she was ready to cum.</p> <p>"I need to cum now." she said.</p> <p>She lay down in the bed and I kissed her lips with one hand. I slipped the fingers of my right hand into her sex hole and finger fucked her to orgasm; it was as intense as it had been before. "I want to feel you cum with me" I said.</p> <p>She pulled my hand away from her pussy and said, "Come back to me now."</p> <p>I kissed her neck but I didn't let up. I wanted her to know she could call me all the names she wanted. She started to lay back so I laid beside her and I told her to roll over. I slid under her and she began to kiss and lick my breasts as she did the same to my nipples. I moved my hips so her sex was above mine so she could rub my slit with her clit. As I started to cum I felt her hands on my abdomen working their way up to my navel.</p> <p>"Can I lick you while you cum?" She asked. I was ready to let her take charge and have me as she wanted.</p> <p>"Oh, God. Yes." I moaned as her body rubbed against mine; our moans echoed in the quiet room. "Yes, Chris, yes, give me a big orgasm." I moaned.</p> <p>As I started to cum I felt her body start to quiver and my own body shaking. She felt me shoot off in herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
