Yeah, I think I'm going to have to take a bus to town."</p> <p>"Oh, and what if they don't answer? Tell them you're coming for a walk."</p> <p>"No, I don't know."</p> <p>"You don't have to, you know. I don't think you'd want them to."</p> <p>"You want to have sex with me. Just like I do when you fuck them in the butt. And then, with my permission."</p> <p>"I don't know..."</p> <p>"Okay, but you'll have to say yes, and we'll take the rest of your clothes and the tube back."</p> <p>"You're crazy, you know that."</p> <p>"Come on, let's get going, okay? You can tell me how a woman treats this woman when you're her boyfriend... but that'll do nicely. We'll be in plenty of time to give you another fuck, you know. Now, where were we?"</p> <p>"I was just thinking that I'd better wash all my clothes. Then we can go."</p> <p>"We can talk later. Right now, I need you inside me. Oh, let's go, baby." After we walked into the motel's lobby, I gave her my cell phone number, and told her I'd be at her place in a few hours. She kissed me deeply and then she stepped on wobbly legs. I took my shoes off and then I walked over to the other side of the car and stood in a dazed, lustful posture. She looked so stunning, kneeling there in my parking spot, and I was sure I would be a while.</p> <p>When I'd finished getting my clothes back and getting into my car, I got my head in the steering wheel, and sat there with her just a foot away. She said,</p> <p>"That was terrific, baby, I love that." "I'd like to do that with you again, and again and again."</p> <p>"And the rest of the week."</p> <p>"The rest of the week? How did you feel about it?"</p> <p>"It was the right thing to do. I mean, I still need to be with you for a month."</p> <p>"You will make a fine girlfriend."</p> <p>I just stared at her, and then said, "I've never been with a woman. Never, and I'll never get another chance with yours."</p> <p>"Well, baby. You're the only one in the whole world who's ever had sex with me, okay? And for you... that's pretty sweet of you, too."</p> <p>I started walking back towards the motel. I just got there and then she turned to walk towards me. I stopped a couple aches over about five feet away. I grabbed her left arm and lifted her into my arms, and she wrapped her legs around my waist. She was trembling and her naked body was warm. She leaned her face up to mine and started kissing me.</p> <p>When our lips parted, she smiled and said, "There you go, that was great." She took one of my hands, and placed it between her legs. I started to finger-bang her as we kissed. When her breathing got quicker and faster, she said, "Oh, I'm really close, baby." I leaned over and slipped two fingers into her wet pussy to check for her G-spot. She had another orgasm right there, and her entire body started shaking.</p> <p>I pushed her back, and she leaned her head onto the cold metal seat. Her legs were still wrapped around me, and she started moaning. I started the car up and then I turned the radio to a soft little hum and I said, "Come on, let me kiss you again."</p> <p>"Oh, really? Please?" she said playfully. She bent down to give me her mouth while she slid her tongue between my lips, and my erection was throbbing. Then she leaned back, looked me in the eyes, asked,</p> <p>"You'll love it, will you?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes. I'll love it."</p> <p>"Well, you haven't gotten an opportunity yet!"</p> <p>"I wasn't thinking... I just wanted to get into your pants, but... they're right out on the street."</p> <p>"It's your choice, my love," I said.</p> <p>We walked back towards her apartment, both hands full of clothes.
