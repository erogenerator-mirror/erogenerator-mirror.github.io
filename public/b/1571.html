You look pretty hot, I could do with catching a couple of you up." He said quietly. She had on a short, tight black skirt with spaghetti straps. White, with red polka dots. She wore a very soft white tank top over a very sheer, low cut bra. It held her breasts firmly in place.</p> <p>"Yeah. And it looks like you are going to catch up," she said with a grin.</p> <p>"What? Why would I want to catch? I had nothing." She giggled.</p> <p>"It's not like that. We were just talking and having a few drinks. You know, I wanted to hit the slopes. You know, get my skis ready. Maybe we could do that again? Let me help you finish your dinner and then you can go on back to your room."</p> <p>"Yeah. Yeah I'm sure. Where is the car?"</p> <p>"At the bar?"</p> <p>He laughed. "I'm going to do that too. Here, here" he said pointing to the door, "I think I will go get my car."</p> <p>When he came back, she was standing up, pulling on her purse and making her way to the bar. When she got there, he handed her a napkin, which she put on the table just inside the bar.</p> <p>"We're out" he said handing her a wok, which she accepted. "How about we start out together, then, I think he can just start with a drink. Okay?"</p> <p>"Sure. Okay let's go."</p> <p>That was the end of his evening. It was the end of the evening when she would make his life. It was the end of everything except being himself.</p> <p>As the night wore on, they talked more. He told her how he wanted a house of his own. He was looking for a one month lease. It wasn't really a lot, but it was a couple of years. He was looking for a job in management with a marketing firm, which he had been told was a dream come true for him.</p> <p>She couldn't wait to work for him. She had been with his company so many times, when his company was up in the corporate world, and his company was up the middle of the map in some ways, that she would be able to pull it off. She was excited. There were other things she was excited about. More than anything she was excited about her own life.</p> <p>It wasn't exactly a whirlwind when they got to know each other. But for awhile, it was just the two of them. When he got to know her, he had her completely enthralled. She felt so close to him that it was almost like he was floating in the air, and now she could feel him around her. Even her thoughts could be a bit of a turn on for her now.</p> <p>He had been the one who had suggested that they get together. He had been the one who had brought in the money for the rent. He knew she had to have a good living for a while, because he had been so sweet to her that she had been looking forward to the evening.</p> <p>When he had said his name that evening, and told her that he liked it, the fact that she had asked for it was enough to make him want her even more. He saw her reaction. She saw the look in his eyes, as if he knew exactly what she thought of him, and wanted him all that much more. For a moment, a moment, she had regretted not spending her whole life with him. And here she was sitting across the table from him, a woman that he thought had been special to him for a long time, standing there as if asking him to marry her, but now she was all that and it was all that. She was like a small puppy. And he liked it.</p> <p>He held his hand out to her and she took it in hers. He wanted to hug her. He wanted to hold her, and hold her to him. And he wanted that to be his.</p> <p>"I'd like that a lot, Lisa, much more," he said, laughing. "Maybe we could even find a table for lunch before the snow starts to fall."</p> <p>Without thinking, she squeezed his hand, and gave him a smile of satisfaction.</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess I'd like that. The table would be lovely. I am so glad you like it."</p> <p>It was almost time. The meal was almost finished. And when they had sat down for lunch, one of the things that he had found and talked about over the years had been a few things. She had been a great hostess. The way they had eaten, the way they had laughed, the way they had talked.
