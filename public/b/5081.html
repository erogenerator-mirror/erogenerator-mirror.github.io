Not that she had never taken medicine like that, but after a few more minutes she had to admit that it sort of kind of hurt to take it. She didn't feel like she could move at all, but she thought she could feel something else in her bones. She didn't expect it at all, but the throbbing persisted and now the pain was more like a slight headache. She wondered how long it would be before she could take any more.</p> <p>She looked around as she lay back down again, but she felt no need to look up anymore, it was too heavy. It must be the lack of energy she had after the fight and the alcohol she had consumed, she thought, thinking she knew when he would come again...</p> <p>She felt a light touch on her leg, it was his hand and it was his hand, and it was actually his hand, but it was the feeling of it rather than some sort of foreign object. Slowly, as she laid back down this time, she could feel nothing but darkness, but it seemed he was looking straight into her eyes. "I'm sorry if I scared you there," he said, "That was very brave of you."</p> <p>She didn't say anything, but her body language spoke volumes as she heard him call her by the name he knew she loved. "Now that we are both in the darkness, we will become one when we wake. When you awaken and feel safe, we will become one... even if you don't think you feel safe until you know all of the places in your body that can hurt a woman for an extended period of time, or even until they reach their zenith. You have no say in the matter as long as your body can handle any pain, even if it are in pain." He gave her a gentle caress, and then another caress as he laid next to her again and laid his hand next to hers, holding it as he looked at the little silver coin with the three tiny stars she had caught in the bowl of gold in the corner of the table. "I am so glad you are feeling better. That was a good start," he said, "and now I want to feel how strong you will be under our love making."</p> <p>He gently lifted her head with a finger, and looked directly into her eyes. "I want you to feel good when your body is free to think... and do all of the things you need to feel good..." he said as his hands caressed her cheeks and then her neck and shoulders. "I love it when you feel good when your own body is free to think about its own good... like you were... when it came to feeling good."</p> <p>He kissed her lightly on the lips, and then began to kiss her breasts and stomach, going so slowly, like he might lick and suck on a nipple while caressing her stomach and breasts, then she thought, what a beautiful feeling how his lips felt on her skin. "Let me feel your body against mine," he said softly and leaned over to kiss her.</p> <p>He began by gently touching her lips with his tongue, then kissed her lips again, feeling her soft, warm tongue, and feeling her soft lips open for him. He ran his tongue along her bottom lip before dipping it into her mouth, and she sucked gently on it, feeling a little tongue in-between them that he loved to feel on her tongue, and then he drew his tongue back to lick her bottom lip again.</p> <p>When he ran his tongue around her bottom lip, and then began to flick it, she could feel her body moving towards something. It began to feel warmer, and she felt herself starting to wet her pussy. He stopped and began to kiss her neck and her shoulder, and then her chin, working slowly down, touching her neck gently with his lips. She was getting closer to a powerful orgasm right now....</p> <p>"Let me feel the warmth of your body in my body," he said as he got up and got into his own bed. He took a condom off the nightstand, and rolled it on. "I've already cum three times today," he said, "and I want you to know I can't wait anymore for you to be my bitch."</p> <p>He put his clothes back on and she had to get up and get dressed herself as he laid on his side in the darkness. "Are you going to wear those panties with me, or are you going to wear them with me?" he asked.</p> <p>She thought to herself, "What ever the matter? If I really am going to wear these panties with you, I might as well make them feel good too.... " She replied, "I think I might like that idea a lot..." She felt her heart pounding in her chest, something she had never felt beforeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
