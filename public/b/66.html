"What a surprise."</p> <p>Todd seemed a little taken back, and I noticed his eyes were bulging.</p> <p>"Are you ok? I didn't see you come in like that."</p> <p>Toni replied, "Yes I am, but I need to go and look out my window, that one's right on the opposite side of the road."</p> <p>I had to say something. I looked over at Todd and he just sat there.</p> <p>"Todd, that was unbelievable."</p> <p>I knew what part I had to play. I decided to play.</p> <p>"So, you didn't come in to talk again?"</p> <p>He just smiled and looked at the floor.</p> <p>"It was nice for me to see you again, but it looks like we're on the wrong side of town. I'll call later."</p> <p>I had just stepped outside out the window onto the street, looking for the phone, but to my dismay it turned out to be lost in the rain. I went inside to check what was going on, but nothing seemed to be working. I was in disbelief that the entire thing had gone wrong from just a moment ago. I felt like I was about to throw up and had no idea what to do next...</p> <p>"Todd? Wait here!"</p> <p>Todd followed me out the next door down the street, towards the next intersection.</p> <p>"Where's the phone this time. I'll be back real soon."</p> <p>"Be careful. You're gonna want to call me."</p> <p>Todd just smiled.</p> <p>"What happened, anyway?"</p> <p>"I don't want to talk about that."</p> <p>"You should know. It's just that I just can't get in touch with you, or even if your folks are home right now, or even if they went to visit us for months now. My sisters are doing some shopping in town and they're planning on seeing me by next weekend. That's only two weeks. I have to give that a bit of a rest if I'm going to be able to get all this back straight."</p> <p>"That's not a good thing. This seems like the last one time." He had a strange expression on his face.</p> <p>"We'll make it right Todd." I grabbed my phone and headed down towards the street.</p> <p>"No, wait! What's all that? I left my home phone in here." I turned around, picked it up and looked for a phone, but couldn't find it.</p> <p>"No, that's just it," I said as I put that phone in my phone book. "There's nothing wrong with my family phone. So, I was just going to use it so I can talk to them over the phone for a while. It'll give me some time between calls so I can let my mind go a little."</p> <p>We went back down the street that night, and when we got to our door it was the first thing we heard. There was noise coming off the phone, and as we got closer to the front door we got a better look at the house. We could have easily just gone inside the door of our house and left the noise, but there was a storm already here.</p> <p>One by one, we came upon the door to the house and it was opened by Mr. and Mrs. Sanders. They were both in their early fifties and they were dressed in tight business suits, their hair in very large curls. Todd's face was a mix of anger and fear, I had never heard anything like it happen.</p> <p>"What happened to you?"</p> <p>Toni looked at him and then down at the floor, as though I might have done something wrong. Todd's eyes opened wide, and he looked at her and shook his head.</p> <p>"What happened?" They both asked it at the same time. Suddenly, I felt like a pervert and walked over to Todd.</p> <p>"Toni," I said in a small voice. "This is Todd. He heard something that he's heard before, but doesn't know what's happening here."</p> <p>He looked at me like I had a bug in my face.</p> <p>"What did you hear at my house? I thought you were in trouble with your mother," I said while trying to sound nonchalant.</p> <p>Todd's face softened.
