You might've been born to take pleasure, but with the help of that drug it could actually do a lot of things to a guy. It's not just about sex, it's about pleasure. This isn't just about cunnilingus, it's about sucking a penis, fingering a pussy or ass, it's about sex and love. Just enjoy it and I'll have you in my bed later.</p> <p>By the end of our talk I noticed this subtle change.</p> <p>- I guess we'd better get back to the sex.</p> <p>By the time we got back to our room my penis was once more a stone cold solid steel rod. I pulled up my pants and checked that the condom had gone down pretty well, the little piece of cloth had been pretty dry, too. As I bent to unzip the boots I felt his hand slide into the back of my jeans and pull my cock a little. There was no point putting that cock in my pants any further.</p> <p>- Do you want to see what he's been feeling for all night?</p> <p>- Fuck, no.</p> <p>He was kneeling in front of me, his right hand sliding along my shaft, while his left hand cupped my balls. The fact that I was half turned away made it impossible to look at him. He had to have taken my dick out, it's swollen head bobbing up and down.</p> <p>- I want to be with you when we get the fuck out of here.</p> <p>I wanted that right then. There was also a little part of me that wanted to stay, but it would be like waiting for someone I loved to take over the world from me. He was just a hand, hand; he was always there by my side. As his lips touched mine I knew there was no turning back, that I could ever give him anything that happened, that there would always be a future where he'd stay in bed with me.</p> <p>- I'm really not sure how to make you feel like this again, so I guess I'd just have to let you out of my body too.</p> <p>His fingers, which had been rubbing along my shaft, slid off and rested on the other leg as I unzipped his pants. When the shorts came into view his penis looked so beautiful and swollen it was almost painful. There was a little bit of precum leaking out, I think that's why we came back here. He lifted his body from mine and stood up.</p> <p>- I'm so ready to be fucked, I've never been so ready.</p> <p>I pulled him a little on the end of my stiff cock and he leaned towards me. I could feel my balls hanging close to his face and his tongue licked over them, sending shivers all through me. I just took as much of it into my mouth as I could, pushing his mouth against me as I did so. My tongue explored every part of his mouth; it just kept going. He was kissing me with every thing I had, my lips and tongue, all of the way to his face and neck. He was moaning in my mouth as I sucked him. He was kissing his way down to my nipples, gently and lapped with his tongue, then pulled away.</p> <p>- I think I can't wait any longer, I want to fuck you again.</p> <p>- Come and see me tomorrow night.</p> <p>- It's been a long drive.</p> <p>- I'm still afraid that I don't have a condom, I'm sure we can have something bigger in the day, or somewhere else.</p> <p>I wasn't sure this was true, I had been trying to find a guy to do that for as long as I could remember. Now that it just seemed ridiculous I was going to have to wait another day, until I heard from Mike the next day. It was time I went ahead and did some workâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
