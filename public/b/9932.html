He put his hands around her back and pushed her into him. She felt him grow hard in her hand. His hand moved to cup her breast through the t-shirt and she felt it swell and harden. He continued pushing her, pushing into her hand. She began to feel how his dick was becoming hard, pushing against her fingers. She moved a little and pushed the hand away, holding it in one hand as she felt it growing thicker, harder, harder until she could feel its heat. The heat, the heat making her body shake with excitement. She could feel his hand moving in small circles, pressing into her.</p> <p>"You're beautiful" Her lips kissed hers and she began to move her hand back and forth, feeling the head of his hard cock as it poked against her hand. "I've missed you," she said, turning around to face him again. "I love you, you know."</p> <p>"And I love you," he said. "Let's go to bed, then." He turned her toward the bed and pulled her shirt off her shoulders and down her body. His hands, not caring about all that was going on as long as there was room in the bed, dropped the loose fabric to the floor and kneaded her supple breasts. He moved her to the edge and dropped to sit back down again, his hand stroking her inner thigh making her hips move. She felt her own panties getting wetter and wetter until she felt herself slide down the length of her body and into his lap.</p> <p>He felt her heat and leaned forward. "I love you," he whispered, sliding his fingers along her hair. "The way you look in a skirt, at the diner, at those meetings, what you put on at the coffee shop, all those things." He stroked his hand up and down her back and up and down in her hair. "So beautiful." Her head was back on his lap, her eyes closed. "So soft under my fingers." Her lips kissed his shoulder and down to his chest, her tongue lathering him with light touches. Her hand wrapped tightly around his erection, as she pushed him onto his back again, spreading her feet. His hand came around to touch her thigh as her eyes opened and she looked up toward him, her voice barely above a whisper.</p> <p>"You said so much, so many things..." she said as she opened her legs, her hand stroking his length, watching it grow in her hand.</p> <p>"Yes," he said as he ran a hand over her pussy. She moved over him, spreading her knees wider, opening her thighs. "I mean it." The hand came up to stroke her pussy, her hips pumping up toward it. His fingers teased her opening as his fingers slid along her lips, circling and pushing toward her g-spot, as her finger pushed and stroked her clit, as she felt his dick grow in her hand. When she felt herself go over the edge, as she felt them reach the peak, and the rush of warmth as she came, she heard herself make a low moan and heard him gasp, his hand squeezing her breast as he felt her orgasm. He felt her pussy convulsing around his finger, felt her hips move and spasm again, and again.</p> <p>"I knew you were a good one..." He thought to himself, as one of his hands came up, to stroke her pussy and play with her clit. As she came again, she opened her legs more and felt herself move once more, the waves of her orgasm washing over her body. "I love you." He whispered as his fingers moved down her body, stroking her pussy, feeling her juices still flowing. "I love you." He said as he laid her on her back and came into her, feeling himself move in her, inside of her.</p> <p>After a moment, she felt him pull away, her hands rising to her breasts, and when she saw the tears in his eyes, feeling them there. "I'm sorry," she said. "I can't find the strength to tell you this, but I love you." She leaned in, kissing him softly on the lips.
