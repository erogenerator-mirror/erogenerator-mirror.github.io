Now, she wanted to see his reaction as she laid there, to see what it felt like to have to take him in her mouth. When she saw him, she didn't know what to do.</p> <p>"What is it?"</p> <p>"How many of these days you can wait to see my lips on your cock?"</p> <p>"I ... I don't know," he said, looking over and smiling, "But I want to see it ... to taste you."</p> <p>She smiled back at him, "Well, then..." she said, getting up, "I think I've got a little something for you now," and she handed him the little bottle from her purse on the bureau.</p> <p>He turned on the lamp and turned it on full, and then sat on the bed and stared at her as she took off her bra and tossed it aside. He lifted his head to kiss her breasts, sucking her nipples as he looked at them, and then looked up at her and said, "You are beautiful," and he kissed her again.</p> <p>He pulled her back down into the bed and knelt next to her, kissing her once on the breast again, and then moved down to kiss her stomach, kissing up to her navel, and then down to her pubic hair. They kissed for a bit, then moved closer to the end of the bed and kissed each other, each of them wanting this more than the other.</p> <p>She started again and they kissed, more passionately this time, their mouths moving on each other as they kissed, both eager to please each other. They moved closer still to the end of the bed and kissed the tip of either his cock or her pussy. It was slick with saliva from their kissing and her juices. She held him with one hand and his with the fingers of the other.</p> <p>"I hope," she said, "that you can do me good."</p> <p>Then she slowly lowered her mouth to his cock, taking it into her mouth with a feeling of bliss. Both of them moaned as she enveloped him in her hot mouth, taking in more and more of him with each bob of her head. His eyes were closed and he didn't know how long he was holding himself out of the world, his legs aching so badly that he had to raise his arms to try to steady himself while she worked on him. Finally, he let go of his hands and just held her head tight against him, moving his hips so as to meet her mouth. They kissed and kissed some more, and then she moved her hands between them to feel him moving as she sucked him.</p> <p>Then she broke the kiss and moved down, moving her tongue to his balls and running it up his shaft, sucking one into her mouth and then the other as one of her hands started stroking him while the other continued squeezing and squeezing his balls. Then she let his balls drop as one her fingers worked at the bottom part of his cock, stroking gently as well. Then to his surprise, she took him back into her mouth and sucked him, moving her tongue as it went into out of her mouth and sucking him hard until her mouth was filled with him.</p> <p>He was feeling almost as good as the way she was using him as she moved her other hand to feel him move in her mouth, even harder and faster now as her mouth moved down to her pussy, finding her clit and flicking it with her finger as one of her lips pulled him into her mouth. He pulled his head back as he started moaning louder and louder and harder as she sucked more and more forcefully.</p> <p>He tried to look down to see if she was doing it right, but all he could see in the reflection of the lamp on the bed was her head bobbing faster and faster, each time she took him all the way back into her mouth. He knew he was going to come - not yet - and he wanted her to feel too good, too good for him to last much longer. He pushed his hips upward and he was sure even without taking his cock out of her mouth that he could feel her swallowing as he shot his load down her throat. She kept sucking him as his cum continued spurt out of him, her hands still pumping him as his come started to drain from him.</p> <p>When he let his head fall back on the bed, it was as though she'd forgotten a thing he'd done to her as he kept pumping his cock into her mouth.</p> <p>"Hmmm," she said as she finally withdrew her mouth from him, "I thought you were going to shoot this last thing," with a gleam in her eye as another part of her had started to get off in a fit of eagerâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
