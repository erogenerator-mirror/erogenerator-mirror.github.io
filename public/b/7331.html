I'm going to give it a miss for a minute."</p> <p>A very young lady, probably no more than 18 or 19, entered the office and said: "Mr. President, I need to verify the appointment with you. Is your desk available?"</p> <p>"No, please step on the desk, and get your ass over here." He said.</p> <p>The girl said she would be right back then, and I asked her why. She told me, "The President called down to where she is, and Mr. President needs to see her. He was very upset you were not available a moment ago when you left the office. He wants me to pick him up and bring him here as soon as I can. I'll need you right here."</p> <p>"Okay..."</p> <p>She walked through the front door and locked it behind her. A man came out, which caused everyone to go around the person sitting in the nearest window, then all went back into the office. "Well," said the young woman, "is everyone here?" I asked.</p> <p>"Well, Mr. President, and this is Nancy Williams, an Executive Director of the Department of Transportation, and I want you to introduce me to Mr. President. He knows that I work for you and he is very interested in meeting with you."</p> <p>"Mr. Wargrave, I'll pay $30.00 for your time alone with you, right?"</p> <p>"What? Oh no, I've never even heard him called that. I told him you didn't work at the Department of Education." I said. "Well, I'll pay for the full hour of your appointment and for you to have me come right up to your office right now and meet me there and do the right thing. That's all. I'll sign the paperwork and be on the way."</p> <p>I could see the young lady smile, and that made me smile, at that time. "I'll look forward to it." She said. We got into her car and sat in the back seat, and she gave me a very tight hug as we got out of the car. "I'll call you later. I'll be able to pay you your $30.00 for the hour and a half. Is that true?"</p> <p>"Yes, Mr. President. This is very true."</p> <p>After the young lady had talked with him, we turned off the main road and walked up to the address of the Secretary of transportation and told him to meet me at my car. When he got in the door and got in with me, he just leaned right back over to face me and looked at me, then looked back up at the street, saying: "I'm so sorry, sir. That did not seem like the perfect time to meet you, did it?"</p> <p>"No, no, it was fine. Your name is Nancy Williams, and Mr. Mr. President just has a nice voice, but can be a bit of a wussy sometimes." I replied and he smiled, but didn't say anything else. He just turned back to me and smiled broadly. "I would love to meet you, sir," he said.</p> <p>I smiled back, and told him to get behind the wheel and sit in the front and start it up, and to drive the four hundred miles to my office and then drive to the school. He got out of the car, and I told him to stand in the hallway and take his seat. I told him to walk down the hallway toward the front door, get an old gym bag out of the glove box, and carry it over the railing to the stairwell. I told him to get back in the front seat and do all the work while we waited for him.</p> <p>I got out of the car and helped him take a seat next to me. I felt his arms around my waist and I felt him lean close, and he gave me a soft kiss on the cheek. After our little private embrace, he leaned back, reached into the backseat and pulled out his wallet. He was going to have to go through some paperwork that he would be required to do tomorrow evening, but he didn't have to do it by himself. He had it in plenty of places.</p> <p>I didn't hesitate to give him a big kiss on the lips, not a peck but a quick one to let him know how much I loved him and that I really wanted to keep him. My lips felt moist against his, and I could have made any number of promises to try for him. Our bodies pressed together, I felt his hand slide up my thigh and between my legs, and I felt my heart start to beat as he ran the tip of his finger lightly up the outside of my lips.
