"You have the right to. I didn't want to wait." With that she pulled off the thong, revealing a beautifully trimmed mons.</p> <p>The soft touch was a new touch for us, and I gasped as I looked back at her. Her gaze seemed to be focused on every bit.</p> <p>"We need to get out of our bathing suits," she said, her voice husky and urgent. "It's so warm out here."</p> <p>Sasha laughed again, then went to stand up. I noticed that Sasha had already pulled off her own clothing. I heard what sounded like music and it sounded like that same beat. She climbed back into the tub, then moved to slide back beneath the water.</p> <p>"We need to lie here for a few minutes," she said, then sat down and looked back over at me.</p> <p>"We won't get far."</p> <p>I had no intention of lying anywhere else, as they were. I reached out for the jets, and Sasha's body moved down toward them. Her pussy glistened in the light as she looked at me and smiled. She reached out, placing her hand on my thigh, then leaned over and pressed her lips against my crotch. I put a hand on each of her shoulders, and pressed them into the tub.</p> <p>They had always felt so soft and warm around me as we lay together, so I wasn't sure how they were supposed to move or react. It didn't really bother me though. Sasha would do that for a while, and I'd just hold onto the water with one arm, letting it float up beside us.</p> <p>But soon the water got too hot and too cold and the bubbles started to run out of the tub.</p> <p>"We're about to have to put an end to this," she said softly, pressing her hands further up.</p> <p>"Well...maybe just a bit..." I said, trying to sound casual.</p> <p>"Just a few minutes?" Sasha asked, raising her head and turning back.</p> <p>"Well... I... I mean, I'm not ready either..."</p> <p>"Hm hm," she chuckled, raising herself up into the water.</p> <p>Sasha's hand rested on the side of my hip, then turned her back toward me. "And you wouldn't like it if I got naked down there." Then she moved her body toward me, and I felt her hands slide up my chest and her thumbs slide behind my nipples. Her tongue pushed open my lips just a bit, then circled the tip of my tongue, before retreating. Then she took my hand and dragged it down her back.</p> <p>"So let's get it over with," she said, as her hands slowly slid over my ass and up toward my shoulders. "You need to do what I say, right?"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," I agreed, pressing my fingers against her skin, then running them up and down her sides to the front of her chest.</p> <p>I slipped my hands away from her body, sliding them under her arms as I drew back until our bodies were just inches apart.</p> <p>"Hmmm," she commented as her fingers slid across my skin, then drew me slowly up toward her. She wrapped her arms around me, and I could feel those slender soft legs come up beside me. Our breasts came together, pressing together with our arms as my lips sought hers.</p> <p>"Hmmm," she whispered softly. "It feels good, doesn't it?"</p> <p>"Mm hm," I affirmed, sucking gently on Sasha's tongue. "I just can't believe that I'm actually going to do this."</p> <p>"Well," she sighed, letting her hands come up to my head. "You can be honest with me, if you want to. Let me keep you fully exposed to me."</p> <p>I felt her skin start to come down in a slow, gentle descent. When she reached my breasts she slid her hands down and gripped my shoulders and pushed my body against hers.</p> <p>"You're just about the right height for this to work, isn't it?" she asked. Her lips parted against mine, and her tongue slid out and swirled between mine. She held my head as it slid along her mouth, and her tongue was a mass of heat and moisture. I began to melt against her, feeling the warmth and passion of her body and her lips around mine.</p> <p>One of Sasha's hands slid down my side, slipping over my hip and down to my bottom. Her fingertips pressed against me as they slid the bottom of my ass, then rose back up, up toward the top of my mound where it sought to claim me. I felt that firm touch, followed with the soft pressure of her fingertips, before her skin was pressed into the small of my back. Our chests touched, and she sighedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
