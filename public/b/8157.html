It was time to get dressed! Jen jumped on her bed and pulled her covers up over her. She took the towel and dried herself off, but kept her head and hands on her bed. Jen didn't bother turning on any lights. She did however, open the window a little and slid the blinds up, but she didn't see anyone.</p> <p>She reached into the robe and wrapped it around herself. Then pulled her legs up to her chest. She had never done this before, but thought the idea would be quite interesting. She pulled her nightie out of the robe and put it on. She slid on her socks, her panties and pulled them on. Again she did not look around.</p> <p>She went to her overnight bag and put on her nightie. She reached over it and took the nightie off. It felt smooth and her nipples stood at attention. As she slipped it on she realized she had not put on panties, which didn't seem fair. It felt better on her smooth mound.</p> <p>The nightie barely covered her ass. It did hide her breasts, but only for a few thin inches. Jen could not see if her ass was nice or not. She pulled the dress over her head and put on her panties. It didn't make it any easier when she pulled the robe back over her naked body. She took of the robe and slipped her hand into her panties. She slid them down and her right hand slipped down inside her panties. She felt her hand slowly slide over her mound. She moaned involuntarily when she touched her very wet pussy.</p> <p>She opened her eyes to look out of the window, but noticed that it was dark outside. She slipped a finger into her pussy and began to finger herself. She moved her finger in and out faster. she squeezed her finger around with the other one. She began to breathe quickly as her excitement built. She rubbed her finger all around her clit while still rubbing it between her legs. She could feel the wetness on her finger and slide the other around the same time. Her moans intensified and her breathing became even heavier. She pulled her finger from her throbbing pussy and pushed it into her mouth. It was coated in her pussy cream.</p> <p>Without saying anything Jen slid the nightie over her head, threw the robe on the chair to put on and picked up her panties. She put them in her hand and grabbed her nightie as well. She pulled her robe back up and fastened it quickly, covering the nightie. Jen finished getting dressed, slipped her robe on and slipped the nightie onto her shoulders, along with her panties.</p> <p>Jen quickly slid her dress out of the closet and made it another one, this one hung to mid section. It would keep anything from getting on her body that was too hot to wear. She looked at herself in the mirror for a second. She found herself enjoying the look even though she did not have much. She pulled on her nightie and tucked it in, grabbed her nightie, then slipped on her nightie. There was a note next to her.</p> <p>Jen -</p> <p>I am ready now to meet up with you this Thursday. You are going to look so good! If you are interested in getting undressed and giving head to that boy, I would love to be able to help you out. Have fun. -</p> <p>Jenny</p> <p>Jen was pleased they met. It was fun trying out new things to make her even more excited. She quickly made her way to the shower to get cleaned up and ready for dinner. She was surprised that it was just a shower. It really felt like a massage. It would be nice just to get to know someone.</p> <p>Jen pulled the shower curtain and climbed in. She had just finished washing herself when she felt someone else's hands rub her legs. Jen didn't care. She felt so alive and so turned on. She reached up with both hands and started rubbing her own breast and pussy again. She loved the feeling.</p> <p>This was the first time Jen had ever felt a hands on her body. It felt so good. Her own hand on her breasts felt so right. The feeling of being played with like this, especially through a thin nightie, was really making her horny. As she pinched her nipples a little harder, the feeling was almost too good to be true. She turned around and sat her ass down onto the shower's foot. She began to rub her pussy again, but she was not really interested in her own feeling anymore.</p> <p>She started to move her hips in small circles.</p> <p>"Oh! Oh! Oh God... Ohhh! Oh! OH! Oh! OOHHH!"</p> <p>"Oh you are so dirty! Yes! That feels so... sooooooo."</p> <p>Jen slid 2 fingers into her pussy asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
