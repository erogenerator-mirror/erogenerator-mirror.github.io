On either side of him stood a woman with a large, dark-red face. She was naked too. I found her naked body to be exquisite. I could see her soft and perfect breasts. The curve of her hips was accentuated by her thick meaty thighs and a patch of curly dark hair above her pussy. Her legs were open to make an inviting view.</p> <p>She was dressed the way a doctor would wear to get prescriptions for some sort of birth control device. All black and red ribbons held her in place. She had the most beautiful face I'd ever seen. I wanted to suck on it. Her eyes were the most brilliant green I'd ever seen. Her mouth was full and her lips curved out. Her tits thrust out over her ribcage. It had to be her age. And there were dark circles around the nipples that I recognized from a porn movie.</p> <p>I walked over to her and touched her cheek lovingly. Then I put my hands down and traced her soft black hair away from her neck. Her eyes were wide. She had no idea what kind of a monster my hands would play at and she was a real screamer. I put out my tongue and felt the softness of her cheek and trailed her hair from the roots up to her ear.</p> <p>I traced little circles around and under her earlobe with my tongue. Then I put more pressure on the side of her face and ran my tongue over her. Her soft black hair tickled mine and I knew what I wanted. She tasted like heaven. The smell of lilacs and mint hit my nostril and was intoxicating. I licked her ear then up to her neck again and let my tongue gently caress her. When I moved my tongue to that sensitive spot on the outside of her neck she grabbed the back of my head and pulled me down to her. Her hands were tight on my head.</p> <p>"My husband was just such a slob," she whispered in my ear as her tongue snaked into my ear. "He kept coming into my room. You're my stud!" She said, laughing. "And that pretty little wife of yours, don't you worry."</p> <p>She put her hands in my hair and held me against her. The feel of her soft, warm skin on my fingers, neck and face was too much. I began to lose myself. I began to think that if she knew that I was a man, then she'd probably never get the idea, I reasoned. But somehow, the woman in my arms didn't seem to care about the fact that this stranger was a woman. All of a sudden her hands were covering mine and I was lost in her embrace, kissing her deeply.</p> <p>I was on fire.</p> <p>We had our drinks, which neither of us had had in a while. She was in no hurry and I was enjoying the softness of her mouth on mine. We finished our drinks and took a drink from one of our little bottles. She was so beautiful. I felt dizzy the instant we walked in.</p> <p>We moved towards a couch and when we sat down, the lady behind my daughter pulled her legs up, spreading them wide. I sat down and took a sip from the wine bottle. Then I moved my seat back. When my son lay on the carpet, I could see that his eyes were closed and when he raised his head, he saw me naked. He grinned and opened his eyes to see me holding the water bottle in my hand.</p> <p>"Oh my, you're so beautiful," he said. Then he sat a bit more upright. My daughter turned towards me. She put her hand over her mouth and grinned at me.</p> <p>"Daddy, are you sure that's me?" She asked.</p> <p>"Y-y-you're..." And, that was all that I was going to get.</p> <p>She leaned forward and kissed my cheek.</p> <p>"Oh sweetie, don't think I've ever kissed a man. I'm your daughter and it's okay for me to kiss another man. But if you want to, you better do it in your room."</p> <p>"But mom, I'm your dad. Your sister is your ..." She said.</p> <p>"Yes." She said. Then she kissed me again. A soft, seductive and hungry kiss that made me feel like I could stay in bed forever. Our tongues met and I tasted her. The warm contact of her soft lips on mine was so inviting. Soon our hands explored each others bodies. And it was when she undid my jeans and slid them down that I realized that we were just in time for another kiss to start. When I slid my foot out of the pants and off my foot, she slipped it under her knee, then the other. I rolled over onto my back and myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
