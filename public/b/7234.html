This has the effect of making my nipples stiffen under her touch, and I can feel my cock hardening against my shirt. She continues her conversation.</p> <p>“Did you like it, Jim?” she says it with real venom as if she meant it.</p> <p>“Yes, I did,” I answer honestly.</p> <p>“I liked it a lot, Jim,” she whispers in my ear. “You know you do”.</p> <p>My hand drops down to the waist of my boxer shorts, and I rub myself in excitement. She is hot, and I am glad that she is there for the meeting. I wonder how my dick will fit in her. Her wet hands rub me, and my dick responds by becoming rock hard. I close my eyes and moan in pleasure.</p> <p>“Does your girlfriend know you liked it?” she whispers breathlessly.</p> <p>“Yes, she told me that I was hot.”</p> <p>“I don’t understand, Jim, I haven’t…I just thought you were very nice.”</p> <p>“You’re very pretty”</p> <p>She continues, “Is your girlfriend a slut?” I stammer in shame.</p> <p>“No way, Jim. I’m your girlfriend. Now go to your room and get comfortable.”</p> <p>I get up from the toilet and don’t bother looking to see where my clothes were. I go to my bedroom, and wait for her. I’m about to take off my shirt when she sits on my bed.</p> <p>“What’s going on, Jim?” her voice is almost a whisper as she sits on the bed. My heart drops in fear as she sits on top of me.</p> <p>“I’m scared,” I say in confusion.</p> <p>“Don’t be scared, Jim,” she answers, “I’m not one who is afraid of having sex. You really like your girl, don’t you, Jim, I know you do.”</p> <p>It takes everything in me not to touch her and tell her how much I liked her. I just do.</p> <p>“Yes, I like my girl. I can't help it. It’s just something that we do,” I reply.</p> <p>“I like girls too, Jim, you seem to like girls. You like girls that way, don’t you, Jim?”</p> <p>“Yes, I do,” I stammer out slowly.</p> <p>“Well, I’m going to talk to you about some things, Jim. I’ve found out that you like girls. Is that right?”</p> <p>Now I have a new understanding.</p> <p>“Yes,” I try to explain, “We do have something in common. I mean, we both like girls when we are attracted to each other. Is that right?”</p> <p>“I have no problem with you,” she says, “I can’t think of anyone better.” She leans in a little closer to me, and I can feel the heat of her breasts in my shirt. As she leans in toward me, all I can think of is her warm breath on my face. Her breath is light as always. I could fall in love with her.</p> <p>I am not sure what the best course of action is, but I feel she is more than my girlfriend to me. I could easily fall in love with this girl. Then again, this whole situation has thrown me into a new frame of mind, and I am beginning to wonder if she even knows about it.</p> <p>“Well, do you like girls? Do you like girls now?” she said as if it was her first question. It was and still is.</p> <p>“I…I…I love girls,” I admit that I do.</p> <p>“Yes. You do, Jim,” she replies. Now, it seems her whole personality is changing.</p> <p>“What do you want to do now?” she asks, and her tone turns serious.</p> <p>“I think…I’m not sure”</p> <p>“I do too,” she says as—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
