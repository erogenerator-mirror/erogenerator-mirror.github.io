It was as much physical as sexual as a moment like that. A little of our bodies touched and it was electric.</p> <p>I kissed him back and kissed him more passionately. Soon it became clear she had stopped kissing us. It was just lust. A kind of love. I couldn't tell what we were about: just us. We were just two people enjoying our time together by being together.</p> <p>I broke the kiss with a light playful smirk. "Good show," I said with conviction. I leaned down and kissed him again. She did the same and I felt a pang of remorse for what we had done but she kissed me right back. I felt something stronger, lust, lust. I had to have it with her. And she wanted it too. And I wanted to take everything she had to give me with her.</p> <p>We continued to kiss as she stripped off her pajamas and I watched her. I loved her body. Her firm, perky 34C breasts and her sexy, full hips. Her pubic hair was soft and downy. And soft. It was sexy.</p> <p>"So sexy. I have wanted you from the first day of last month."</p> <p>She smiled.</p> <p>"Thank you. For that and for kissing you."</p> <p>"Are you sure? I was just kidding."</p> <p>She giggled. She had to know I had found out she was pregnant. She giggled again, then looked me in the eye. "Okay. I don't want you to get jealous."</p> <p>"I don't think you should be jealous."</p> <p>She leaned forward and kissed me. It was a nice kiss. She didn't just kiss me but kissed me a little hard and deep. She had me where she wanted me. We kissed again and I didn't stop her. This time, I felt her hands on my bare bottom. I felt her nails tracing against the silk. They did the job. I relaxed and let it happen. I was going to have some trouble finding a place to take it with us.</p> <p>We continued out embrace kissing when she began to pull down her shorts. Now she was naked except for the panties. Not a word was spoken. I saw her standing up. She put her hands on my shoulders and gently pushed me away.</p> <p>"Come with me." She pushed me to the bed. I didn't hesitate and followed her. I lay on my back looking up at her while she spread my legs. She was beautiful. Her hair was blonde and almost a light brown color. Her body was still athletic and tanned. She had the body I had been dreaming about. I watched her as she climbed on and took my legs in her hands. I felt the head of her dick as it grazed against my wet opening. I closed my eyes while she lowered herself onto me.</p> <p>I groaned as I felt her dick enter me. She took my legs and held them up, opening her legs wider and pulling them. I felt the tip of her dick against my asshole and moaned again while she lowered herself onto me.</p> <p>"You like my dick in you?" She kissed my shoulder. "You liked having sex with me. You liked getting fucked in the ass. You liked feeling my dick in you. Tell me."</p> <p>I nodded.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Yes what?"</p> <p>"Yes fuck me."</p> <p>"Yeah, fuck me. Take me. Take all that cock from my ass."</p> <p>"But you don't want me to?"</p> <p>"I never want to lose you."</p> <p>I laughed.</p> <p>"Come with me. We'll get on the bed and enjoy all your sweet things in one night."</p> <p>As she climbed off me, she turned on some music and lay down on her back. She beckoned me to come and join her. I climbed between her legs and she pulled me down to her. I could smell the aroma of her body. I felt the wetness of her on me as I felt her tongue press against me. She gently took my nipple in her mouth as she rolled it between her teeth. The feeling was electric. She let my nipple pop from her mouth. "I'm not done with you yet," she said as she turned to me on her back. She lifted me to my feet and kissed me. My pussy was aching with lust. I wanted our lovemaking so bad I couldn't handle it. She licked me then, taking away my juices. She kissed me again and I groaned. "Please love me."</p> <p>She pulled me close until I wrapped my arms around her neck. I fell on my back with her on top of me.</p> <p>"I love the way you feel on me."</p> <p>"I never wanted everything to be perfect."</p> <p>"I knowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
