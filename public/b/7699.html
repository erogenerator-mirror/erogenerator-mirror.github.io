I loved having her around all the time, and she seemed to enjoy it. There was a certain peace in her voice.</p> <p>"And, you too, Mistress, are I to say?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes, you are indeed," she simply answered and lifted her breasts up into a position where she could sit on me in position, and she straddled me, her cunt resting directly on the tip of my hard cock. She looked over into her pussy as if to ask, "Do you like it?"</p> <p>Without hesitation, I nodded my head as I thrust my hips upwards, pushing my cock through her cunt to meet her warm, wet labia. "Good," she purred, "God...you're making me feel so good."</p> <p>I wanted her too. I loved her and she loved me. Her body was so soft and so beautiful. I reached around her body and felt her breasts, as my cock swelled and lengthened even more.</p> <p>"And you, too, are beautiful," I said, reaching up for her breasts again.</p> <p>Her body, as all woman in the world, responded to those words and her cunt clenched against my hard cock. It was hard to explain. "I'm only human, I'm beautiful." It was true, but it was true to who I was and how I felt. It never failed to turn on the man in me.</p> <p>She sat on me, just like we had been before, and I felt her breasts on my chest. It was just as I had imagined. But... I really didn't think it would be. I knew that I'd never feel the same when we made love. My cock stiffened as though it was being squeezed and pulled hard.</p> <p>"You'll love it," she said. And, just like that, she dropped to her knees beside me and leaned forward. I could feel her hot breath on my neck and ear.</p> <p>"I... I didn't realize... I mean, I'm... I'm so... so sorry, Mistress," I began to say, and then realized. "I loved it..." She paused and kissed me softly, which I still couldn't believe.</p> <p>It was as if she could see that I was remembering, and it was as though I'd just finished telling the story and had finished the story. She kissed it again. "I loved your words, baby," she said. "I love your cock." We both giggled.</p> <p>She leaned back and stood, taking my hard cock in her hand. "It's okay." She put one hand onto my cock and stroked it. "It's not, like, all right, it's not real hard. It's just, like, so very hard." She bent, taking me in her mouth and licking it. "It's nice and smooth, and it's hard, too. Does it make you feel any different?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes," I said.</p> <p>She began to take me as gently as she could, and when I was good and rigid, she let my cock slide out of her mouth and she licked up the remaining pre-cum, which quickly became opaque. "I think you love sucking cock," she said. "I know you need to feel the cock in your mouth, but..." She ran her tongue along the head of my cock, licking it up and down. "Don't you love it when your pretty little cock does you?"</p> <p>"Yes," I croaked, "It loves to belong, Mistress."</p> <p>"Tell me," she said as she slowly, tantalizingly, took me back into her mouth. Just like now, her tongue was fluttering across the head of my cock, and as her mouth moved up and down, her head began to move side to side as she sucked me in and out. "Tell me, you little cocked bastard," she groaned as I felt her tongue sliding against my shaft and fluttering across my balls, while her hands gripped my shaft firmly. "Tell me what you want."</p> <p>I began to pant, as my cock, while throbbing against her face, was trapped in a prison of her lips and tongue. I looked down at her and watched as my cock slid in and out of her mouth. It was lovely to watch it slide in and out of her mouth. How it seemed to fit in her little pussy was beyond me.
