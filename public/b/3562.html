It was a short walk; I could feel the butterflies in my stomach as the crowd thinned and less than five minutes later we were sitting at a table in the back of the bar. We hadn't even made it to the back before he ordered us two beers, I guess I'd only drank three or four beers. I was on the verge of passing out when Bill and Sandy took our jackets, he didn't need the sleeves.</p> <p>Sandy was a little shorter than Bill and a lot paler, although they had a certain similarity. They hadn't had much to do with it, though. They had a very similar build. Sandy had blonde hair, while Bill was moustachey. I'm sure that we hit it off right away; we both looked like kids. Bill and Sandy were both about the same height and both had a bit better chest. Bill was a little thinner, but not terribly so.</p> <p>We didn't take any notice of the other patrons as Bill put up his arms and then put his hands on my shoulders. I was nervous as he slid his hands up the sleeves of my jacket. Bill felt my tense up and said, "You look great. This is my friend, Sandy." I had the feeling that Bill had said someone's name and when Bill said it, I felt I could be heard in the room.</p> <p>I felt Bill's hands relax and then he stood up. He pulled me to him and, to my complete surprise, I felt his hand sliding down my arm. As Bill held me I was shocked by how warmly and lovingly and with a smile that actually brought a blush to my cheeks.</p> <p>"Wow. I'm not sure what to do," I whispered in his ear.</p> <p>"You don't really have to do anything at all," he replied, kissing my top lip as he slipped his own around mine. "You'll learn to love it, if you learn to love it."</p> <p>We sat in a somewhat awkward silence as Bill slid his hand up behind my neck. He slipped his hand under the waistband of my camisole and as he cupped my breast I felt his hand cup both of my breasts and I almost gasped as his fingers found my nipple. I had never gone without my own clothes in public. Even my underwear had been around for ages.</p> <p>Bill pulled his hand out of the camisole and placed it on my shoulder. "Sandy you look gorgeous. I wanted to go back to our office and get you a little something for the next time that we are in town," Bill said as he brushed his lips against my ear.</p> <p>"Do you think our other friend is coming?" I nodded and then turned to him. Bill looked me in the eye and said, "Come with me. I'll be back in a minute." He turned and with my arm, carried me off to what I now realized was my office.</p> <p>Bill was a tall athletic guy, standing at five and a half feet tall with broad shoulders and long blond hair the same color as my friend's had been. As soon as we were inside, Bill pulled me in front of him and kissed me, his arms around my neck as his fingers began to explore my body.</p> <p>"This has never happened in all my young life until this is what happened. I can't tell you how much I have enjoyed myself," Bill said.</p> <p>"It was great," I replied.</p> <p>Bill smiled and turned me loose.</p> <p>"What do you want to do now?" I asked.</p> <p>"I have something I want to do," he said. "Come with me." He led me through a back door into what was once a storage room. It was a storage room with a large sliding doors, a sliding glass door with a screen dividing the floor through a large window on one wall; a very small walkway leading down to a large wooden bench that had a window that I recognized for what it was. Bill had his pants around his ankles as he sat on a bench as I undressed and then, almost on cue, I sat on the bench in front of him as he removed his shirt and shorts, revealing a thick hard cock that stood out at least a foot.</p> <p>"I want you to stand," he instructed with a smile.</p> <p>"I know but I need to have a drink first," I said quickly, "I need to get this off of me."</p> <p>Bill nodded and sat down, his thick penis standing straight up. "Take off your clothes," he said as he gestured toward my naked body.</p> <p>"I've never done this before," I explained.</p> <p>"It's a little more daring than you believe, isn't it?
