"My name is Martin," he said, extending it.</p> <p>"I'm Rebecca," said Rebecca with mock surprise. "And your name is Elizabeth?"</p> <p>"You know I do," replied the doctor.</p> <p>"Perhaps in future we shall discuss a number of common questions. First, why did you come up with that idea?" asked the doctor.</p> <p>"I found that there was something very appealing about our research," said Rebecca. "I decided to do the same research, but had to put it off until we could get to more exciting things."</p> <p>"That sounds very promising," said the doctor. His face was still an expression of surprise, and although he probably hadn't expected Rebecca to be so willing, he was not disappointed either. Rebecca was not a very bright woman and her brain seemed to have switched off at some point, probably for good. She also wasn't as enthusiastic about sex, but was still looking the part. In fact, if Rebecca were to have a lot of sexual experience and desire, it was because she wanted to improve her education. The thought of having sex with her husband was a turn on as well. It wasn't just her body, but the fact that she actually wanted to do those acts that she'd said her body didn't like.</p> <p>It was time to go and meet my family. Rebecca left before the evening was over, though she had intended to stay a little longer. I decided to meet and talk with the doctor that evening.</p> <p>I drove up to my house with a bag. I couldn't help being impressed by the place. It was quiet; the lights were off. I went inside, set my bag down and turned the lights off. I decided not to lock the front door so there would be no interruptions. I put on a white bra and panties set that I had kept since being able to walk straight. I wore my normal white shirt and a black button up. My skirt was black, but the material was more sheer than my panties. My white blouse was unbuttoned and the buttons were undone, but the open buttons had caused a gap in my breasts. I wore a simple white long-sleeved blouse tied at the collar. The skirt was also unbuttoned, but no more than the one I wore that day and the bra was off.</p> <p>When I turned around the house I saw a light on, and guessed that Rebecca was still upstairs. It took me several seconds to realize that the light came from the kitchen, not the light on the bedroom side door. After several seconds trying not to panic I decided it was safe. The bedroom door was ajar, but didn't appear to be closed. I pulled back the shade and walked into the hallway to meet Rebecca.</p> <p>Rebecca was in the kitchen, but she had her back to me, facing me. She was wearing her blouse and skirt, unbuttoned in the front and partially unbuttoned, but I could see her pale white flesh. She had her eyes closed and I could tell that she was breathing shallowly. I turned around for a minute, trying to look as straight as I could. I was about to open the door when a light come on on the hallway outside the kitchen door, but I could barely make out the shape of her naked body that I was certain I would soon be seeing.</p> <p>"Hey sweetie," I heard Rebecca say. "We're about to get naked."</p> <p>"I guess that means we're about to have sex," I replied, half joking. I was glad the lights were off and that I wasn't in a hurry.</p> <p>"I'm just going to change. Let me know if you get nervous."</p> <p>"Rebecca," I said. I was getting nervous.</p> <p>She didn't look over at me. Instead, she lifted up her top and dropped a small amount of it to the floor. She then stood back up to let me see her beautiful breasts hanging before me.</p> <p>"Do you like," she asked, lifting up her top again. She was holding it up with one hand with the other one resting upon her right hip, while she started to undo her top. Her right hand came into view as she lifted it up over her breasts and dropped the one to the floor and dropped the other to her right hip, followed by the other.</p> <p>Rebecca then unhooked her bra, exposing her small, but beautiful breasts and her small, hard pink nipples.</p> <p>She reached out and ran a finger up and down the center line of each one. I saw her nipples get slightly harder while she did the same to her left teat. Suddenly, Rebecca pulled down the skirt of the skirt, stood straight, picked up the skirt at the waist and started to put the bra on insteadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
