I know how you feel and I just..." Jenny trailed off and just looked up at her with tears in her eyes.</p> <p>After taking a deep breath Jenny smiled at her and said, "I'll come to your room so we can talk about this before we leave."</p> <p>"Oh, no you don't," Jenny said with a laugh. "I was so worried about you tonight. I really like that about you."</p> <p>It has been a while, Jenny thought to herself, since they talked and it really made her feel good to hear someone talk about it so openly. "I really liked hearing you talk and it made my life easier for me too," Jenny said in a way which made her feel good to hear from a real man and not just a stranger.</p> <p>Jenny put her arm around her and with her fingers she pulled her close and as soon as they kissed she felt how real she felt. She was going to say that she had a wonderful time but it was too soon.</p> <p>Jenny pulled herself up and into her room and pulled on a pair of shorts and a halter top. It was a warm winter evening, and she was trying to decide what to wear tonight. She didn't want to get naked, but if it brought on a bad mood it should at least be done before it happened.</p> <p>She went into the living room and then into her closet to pick out something to wear to bed tonight. She grabbed a dark blue cotton short skirt and white t-shirt with black trim.</p> <p>She slipped on her favorite bra and then picked out a pair of dark fishnets and pulled them on. She picked out a pair of sheer black stockings with a pink bow on each leg, then a sheer black garter belt and matching pair of black high heel shoes.</p> <p>Jen decided she didn't care which clothes would be worn tonight and she wouldn't be able to wear a bra so she had to leave them on.</p> <p>After she changed she took a glass of orange juice and picked it up after she had finished fixing her eyes. She opened the bathroom door and peeked her head inside. She had to get out of this house right now, but she just had to put the lid down and take something from the kitchen to eat.</p> <p>She went back into the living room where she could find a light on and turned on the lamp and left it on. Once it was on she set the light around to its highest setting and just stood there. She leaned it over and looked out to see if it made anything that she thought that she would look at better. She wondered for a moment how she would face her brother the next day.</p> <p>Jenny had just finished fixing her eyes and hair, and as she did so her mind went wild between them. While she had watched all her school stuff go bad and it was all at her brother's house and while it had turned into a nightmare she knew she still had to put those things to her mind.</p> <p>She remembered everything, from the wildest thoughts of going out with her brother at that point, to how she had been sitting in the bathtub with her eyes closed trying to keep the tears from falling when he got mad. She just loved it when she finally had to fight against his will.</p> <p>In Jenny's mind she had gotten up when she heard the light on in the bathroom so she went out to the kitchen and took out a bowl of food and put it into the fridge to warm. She turned on the microwave and then walked over to the table that was in front of the mirror, and placed the bowl carefully in the middle. She sat it down, then took it from her and placed it in one of the long dish chairs.</p> <p>Jenny got to her feet and picked up the bowl and headed over to her brother's room. She knocked on the bathroom door and it slowly opened. She heard a soft gasp from inside the bathroom and then she heard Jenny's voice saying, "I thought you were going to throw this in here," Jenny said out of the blue. She just smiled at her and then said, "I had too much on my mind for that."</p> <p>"What are you smiling about," Jenny asked as she took another sip of juice and took it off the bottle. She then poured a small cup into the glass and set it to the side.</p> <p>"Just being you." Jenny said as she took a sip of the juice, "I just need some of that hot tea you're holding in the corner."</p> <p>She reached over and put the cup on the night table and then she took aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
