I climbed gingerly off her and we both lay on the bed naked and I was still on my back. She lay down beside me and we continued to smile and talk, holding each other, talking about the whole business of sex. After a while I kissed her and asked about the next road that would take us to the cabin.</p> <p>"Did you know that Jim is going to take you to bed?" she asked, suddenly making the turn, her face looking directly at mine. My arm went around her, as she leaned in, her naked body pressed up against me, her hand resting on my stomach.</p> <p>"What about Jim," I said, "and how are you going to do it with him?"</p> <p>Lisa grinned at me and said, "He'll be here any minute."</p> <p>She kissed me, lightly at first but then harder. She pressed her tongue into my mouth and my cock stirred and I raised my hips. Then her hand found my cock, grasped it, brought it to attention. Lisa brought her lips to my face and kissed me.</p> <p>"What are we going to do," she asked, smiling at me as she kissed me.</p> <p>"Just the two of us here. I'm going to get undressed and have my way with you."</p> <p>She grinned then kissed me again and slid her shorts off and her knickers. She lay there in just her panties and bra.</p> <p>"Come and take your panties off," I said and she turned on her back.</p> <p>"No, my darling," she said as she rolled out of the way and lay back with her legs parted. I kissed my way up her leg, her ankle, kissed her inner thigh and came to rest on her. I started to caress her, my tongue licking her lips then parting them with the tip, lapping at her, tasting her, drawing out the anticipation. I moved further until I could lick and suck her labia, then pulled her up to my mouth so that I could suck her clit. She was moaning and she lifted my head by my chin and pushed her crotch into my mouth.</p> <p>She was holding the back of my head encouraging me, urging me on, and her breathing was coming faster; she was getting closer to orgasm. I sucked her clit and she was pushing my face into her. I felt her hand on my cock. She had got a hold of the shaft and was wanking me gently, making me stiffen. She put one of my hands back on her breast, the other on her pussy. She started to wail and move her pelvis rhythmically. She was getting there. I moved my mouth away from her clit and went back to her labia. She was soaking wet and I put my mouth to her opening and I plunged all my tongue between them, making her whole body go white; she was moaning and pushing herself against my face. As my tongue probed deeper and deeper into her, she grabbed hold of my head and pushed my face harder against her. She was pulling my face hard against her and she was coming.</p> <p>I pulled my face away, trying to get air into my lungs, but I couldn't, I didn't want to breath. She was on her back, panting and gasping. Her chest was heaving and I could see that she was flushed. She looked over at me.</p> <p>"You bastard," she said, "are you sure you aren't dreaming."</p> <p>I laughed and kissed her gently and rolled her on her side and spooned her, my cock nestled into the crack of her ass.</p> <p>"I still think that I've been dreaming of this for ages," she said, "but now it's not any of my business what I'm doing for you."</p> <p>"You're doing it quite well," I said. "I told you that I had to have you. I'm going to use you and see where you go from here."</p> <p>I was very happy after the way she had put me, and very pleased at how I had been making love to her. I moved slightly, trying to get between her thighs and my cock went back inside her. I started moving in and out, up and down, up and down. It felt absolutely heavenly. I didn't fuck her for long, just to add a little pleasure to the pleasure of being buried deep inside her. That I could do with lots of lubrication. I started to move faster but kept on moving until we were both grunting and moaning with effort. She pulled her legs towards her chest to better support herself and I kept moving deep inside her.
