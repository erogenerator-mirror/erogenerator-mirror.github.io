In the bedroom I began to remove my panties and tossed them on the floor and got into bed. That evening we went out to a nice quiet restaurant where I picked out my new favorite. Not sure of where I was going with this but I was determined that I had to tell Kay that I loved her. Before I could go down the line, Kay stopped me, turned to face me and said she loved me also. It just hit me like an ear full that she had never actually said that. When I thought about it further she just blurted out, "You don't have to tell me. I want to tell you everything, that what I have just told you has my heart beating so loudly that you could cut the lights off. I also need you to tell me everything that I have just told you because if you think it's going to help me, I'll tell you."</p> <p>I smiled at her and told her I loved her just as much as she loved me. She did say that to stop me from saying anything later; I wanted to make certain she knew that she had my mind completely focused on her. Once we got out of the restaurant, we did our normal thing after we got back in our car. Kay opened up about what she had been talking about. She mentioned all our trips she was taking to Atlanta and our trip to Miami in the Bahamas. My mind was spinning. The more she told me about her visit to see Kay, the more excited I became. Kay also mentioned that I didn't think it was going to help me because I didn't know the full extent of her feelings and feelings toward me.</p> <p>We got home and Kay was feeling a lot better and more confident. It was at the end of our little game when Kay reached her bed and pulled the covers up as she lay there beside me. "I really love you, Will." I don't know if she was trying to get me to think that something or anything would happen between us again.</p> <p>"Kay; I don't know if I can be that confident. I don't think it's going to be that easy. Do you have any good stories to tell me or anything else yet?"</p> <p>Kay said that she had a few but that she needed to be completely candid with me and I needed to see if I was really ready to tell her about what has been going on between us again. After a few minutes of lying there, Kay told me that one thing led to another and that is another story to tell you both but she wanted to hear if any good was coming from it or was there any way that I could actually do it again and tell Kay how I feel.</p> <p>Kay was lying so close to me. She had her arm down over my breasts. Our clothes were still on one of the beds so there was no chance of me finding them again. I didn't think I had anything to lose but I was going to have to tell Kay how much I missed her and that I have been so happy with myself that I don't mind telling her what's really bothering me about her feelings toward me and what I'm feeling about her.</p> <p>If we both agree to try to help each other make some sort of change in our relationship, she would like to know how that makes it feel. I promise it'll help; I want you to think about what this means for you and for her.</p> <p>Kay and I had a long talk Saturday night and agreed to go see an old movie together. We didn't even know the name of the movie until we arrived at the theater. We went into the theater when we wanted to wait and see what it was. When the lights dimmed from the opening credits, we saw a movie starting. We both were so excited when we got out; we couldn't wait to see what the movie was like once it was over. When the credits started we saw the movie playing a pretty standard theme. We watched the entire movie and talked about her and us until we were tired. We had to leave soon.</p> <p>We left for a motel about five hours later and Kay got me ready to go. We went into the motel after about ten minutes, found something we would like to use and went to our cars. As we got in the room, there was a note on the bed that read: "I thought that you would like my story so I am going to tell you this when we get back to the motel tonight. Take off your panties and you will be naked again when we get back to the motel."</p> <p>Kay had to laugh when I told her about what I did just a week earlier. While we were in the motel room, we talked some more then she made us both a drink. After our fourth drink, Kay told me that she had to go to a meeting in a couple of hours. "Do we need to see a map or somethingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
