I felt her body twitching as I came in her.</p> <p>I collapsed on top of her.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck," Sarah cried as she came, too.</p> <p>I felt the sticky liquid oozing between us.</p> <p>"Oh, shit," we said in unison, and fell asleep on her bed.</p> <p>We didn't wake up till our heads hit the pillow. I'm sorry!" Sarah cried.</p> <p>It was a beautiful fall day, but it was raining. I don't know about her. I'd gone two hours without cumming. And my body felt so exhausted, from lack of activity, and I wanted sleep with her.</p> <p>I rolled closer to her, and reached over her. Our thighs bumped together, and touched.</p> <p>I ran my hand down her face.</p> <p>Sarah sighed.</p> <p>"It's okay. You can go to sleep without having to wake up. It's all over now."</p> <p>As promised, she fell asleep within moments, with me spooning her.</p> <p>"I'll wake you up later," I said, as I was leaving with the door unlocked.</p> <p>Later Sarah looked at me in surprise.</p> <p>"What you're doing is totally inappropriate," she said. "Don't do that with any of your students. If you did you would have had to pay. That goes both ways."</p> <p>"I promise. I don't even know what it is you're after, but it will be fun. It's just like being with a man. How much more fun does it feel? You'll have to come back whenever you want, or get dressed again," I said.</p> <p>Sarah looked at me with surprise and surprise. "We can't stop. I don't want you to find out about this," she said.</p> <p>"How would you feel if I told you? You know I wouldn't want to lose my cherry to this hot, horny student of yours," I joked. "But I would certainly go after her if she told you that."</p> <p>"That's not true. I've always known." But the thought of it still excited her. I've loved it since, since she could talk to me. And I could tell that even after the day spent together, she still thought I was really cute.</p> <p>"But I'll come back just to see her," she insisted.</p> <p>"Come on then. What would you tell her? What are you hoping to show her," I offered</p> <p>"I'll give it up," Sarah said. "It'll be a lot of fun for both of us."</p> <p>"But Sarah," I said. "How would you feel?"</p> <p>She looked at me, confused. "You're right. She can't possibly know, but I don't know. I have to get back home to my parents or something."</p> <p>"I won't do that. I still haven't fucked her," I said, with a smile.</p> <p>"Oh, no. That's my fault. She's not really ready for some serious incest."</p> <p>"If you had a cock, she would be ready. That's all," I said, and left her room to go to hers.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>"So do you think you can teach me sex?" I asked Sarah the following Monday morning.</p> <p>"No. I didn't think I had a chance," she said. "I'm sorry, but I'm really not into girls."</p> <p>"Let's discuss this further. Do you remember the first time we had sex?" I said.</p> <p>"Let's not do this any more. It's just sex, right?"</p> <p>"Yeah, right. And you've been a very good teacher. Now just make sure you do things the right way, before you tell her."</p> <p>"OK,' she said, still a bit dubious. "But do me a favor."</p> <p>"Sure thing," I said, and got her naked again.</p> <p>"Do you want to suck me off?" she asked. I just grinned.</p> <p>"Um, no. I was just kidding."</p> <p>"Ok. I'm sorry," she said. "There's something else."</p> <p>"You're kidding?"</p> <p>She nodded. "If I suck your cock, will you suck mine? I really think you do want to," she said.</p> <p>"Sarah, I'll think if you're serious. It's just something else."</p> <p>I got up, undressed, and sat to masturbate. She joined soon after, but before anything else happened, she took off the rest of the clothes I wore the previous week. I was surprised she'd even take off everything.</p> <p>For the next few weeksâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
