As she thought about it her fingers flew to it, they slid along the fine stone material, and then into the soft black curls between her legs. She held them to her, trying to sooth the memory of her wedding, her brother, and her husband, and to make her feel better for her actions.</p> <p>"How long are you going to be gone?"</p> <p>"When you get here," she replied quietly. "I'll be waiting for you in a moment. This gold is worth more then you know, in gold or diamonds, at the moment. I need to be more careful in this part of my life, so I can't just take a piece of jewelry for the world. I need to be so lucky that you'll come to see me again."</p> <p>She didn't even know if it was just a dream or a dream, but she'd have liked to have taken the idea a little more seriously. Her friend was the one who she would eventually marry. "You have to be sure that the two of you aren't the two of them, because it is not possible for you to be single again after that."</p> <p>"I suppose it is, but I am not worried about that. You'll have such a good family, and I don't see why you leave this city with nothing."</p> <p>Cara looked across the table at the large black leather purse on the table and the old wooden spoon, waiting for her to turn in her chair. She didn't say anything, but her eyes were on every square inch of the man in front of her, and each time she turned she looked at him. She felt as if she wanted everything, if she had anything to offer, but she knew that she wouldn't take back what she had just done, that it would never happen again. The man, while a handsome man, who looked to be near her age, was handsome, but also a little too tall for her taste, and she knew that he would never get along with her. The smile that lit her eyes was a smile that he thought she'd never see again that day, his face that she had just made with that silly little dance with the priest.</p> <p>"Would you like me to wait here by the pool or would you like me to come get you? Or will you go with me instead? I would love for you to come with me."</p> <p>He looked deeply into her eyes for a long moment and then asked in a soft, gentle voice, "Cara, do you want me to have my way with you?"</p> <p>She thought for a while, unsure how she felt about him, or even if he would be capable of doing it in a safe manner. "Do you want me to do anything for you, or do you want to watch me while I do something else?"</p> <p>He stood, walking around the table to the side of her chair and taking her hands. "Do you want me to go inside now?"</p> <p>Her thoughts were turning to him, then suddenly a new idea came to her, "Would you go with me to the pool, then? I'll walk with you."</p> <p>"What? No, of course not. The pool is not part of the palace, and it would be fun to come to it with you. You see a pretty young woman come and talk to you in the pool, so you'll be a little surprised at who is here."</p> <p>Her face brightened even more now, "I thought that you would never ask."</p> <p>But he didn't take her hands back. He placed them firmly on the arms of her chair and looked deep into her eyes, his smile broadening, "You were afraid that people would say that you were crazy when you spoke to me."</p> <p>Cara felt so silly, "Please don't tell anyone, about this; I'm so sorry that it would have all ruined my life. If it hadn't I'd have done what you told me to do. How could I have gone along with all the lies? I'm so sorry."</p> <p>"Cara, I'm a good listener and believe me, I will listen to you. So long as you follow through with all this, I will love you when you are happy."</p> <p>She closed her eyes for a moment, then nodded and gave him one last light kiss. "I will never do anything for you that you don't want me to do."</p> <p>"All I want is you to be happy with the way things are now," he smiled and then walked with her to the steps leading up to the deck.</p> <p>Cara watched him walk back, the muscles in his calves and thighs glistening under the sunshine. She couldn't believe she had felt so nervous about his intentions, but at theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
