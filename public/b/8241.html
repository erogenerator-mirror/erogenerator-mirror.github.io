There is nothing under here," she pointed down the hall.</p> <p>I did it as quietly as I could. The room was the first time I had ever occupied it, and there were a couple of sinks. I turned on the water and started working the steam up the small toilet. When the water ran out, it rained down on the mirror. The stream slowly subsided until it stopped.</p> <p>There was a small window opening on the small bathroom and I looked out. It was a little more than an hour since my wife left.</p> <p>Wanda was standing behind me. "I've got something for you," she offered.</p> <p>"What?" I asked, confused.</p> <p>"We talked. You know. About you and Dan."</p> <p>I stared. "I remember. He asked me to meet the man in my office the week before."</p> <p>"Oh, I see. Well, that doesn't change anything," she said and gave me a warm kiss on the lips.</p> <p>"You really should have talked to me sooner on that topic," I responded.</p> <p>"I wanted you and Dan to know. You know I love you. Dan knows."</p> <p>"Wanda, really, I didn't mean it that way. It's not like that at all. It just happened. When you got off work, Dan got here to talk to your folks."</p> <p>She didn't even smile, but I saw it. "Wanda, thank God. I just don't know if I could have made it last."</p> <p>"Don't worry, I was there. That's what happens in relationships. You just have to see how much of a deal breaker it is."</p> <p>"If I can see him, what are we going to do about him?" I asked and she was nodding. "I'll talk to him about it. He needs to know. I don't expect him to understand or trust himself."</p> <p>Wanda reached into a drawer and pulled out the white box marked 'T' and held it before me. Her eyes seemed to read my mind. "You can talk now. It won't be long. They won't hurt you, even if they are not a match. Dan really likes us as friends and we feel it is important."</p> <p>"I don't want you to be hurt because you don't know me."</p> <p>"What is it? You haven't told me."</p> <p>"Wanda, remember, he is the man of my dreams. He loves everything about me and will make me feel as much as he will make me feel."</p> <p>"You're right," Wanda continued. "He is the man I thought was going to take Dan to bed in our marriage, but I am getting better. He has accepted his new position at the company and I have him trained. I was afraid of that. He never took off for school. He works. I am sure he will be successful."</p> <p>"He's still a virgin."</p> <p>"I know but I have heard. That is part of the reason I decided to do something about this situation."</p> <p>"I can't believe you said that."</p> <p>I turned off the water and stepped out of the shower. I wrapped a towel around myself and returned to the bathroom. Wanda was standing in front of my bathroom mirror, holding an item that did not show up for my inspection.</p> <p>"I have one of those," Wanda said as I approached her. I watched as she turned and took the item from her hand but stopped me. She continued to examine the item with an amused expression. "It is very expensive; you will need it in the future."</p> <p>"Now what? I don't think so. I know I should just..."</p> <p>I cut her off. "No! I want to. Dan needs to know and I think it would be best if we just talked before anything else happened."</p> <p>"Of course he's going to hear. It's not likely that he would accept any sort of commitment from you when it comes to this matter. It is just something I have to figure out."</p> <p>"You're right. This has nothing to do with Dan. I know he wants me, but Dan wants you. That doesn't mean I can't love him. It is a matter of finding a way to let him know I love you. He may want me too, but not me. He does love you, but he will still want you. Don't worry; I think he will understand, but won't see you and think it is his place to treat you in any way."</p> <p>With a pang of anger I knew she would be able to see that. "I don't know. I just know the answer to that.
