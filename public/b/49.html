She felt she could live with herself; she was afraid, in part because she was ashamed, and also because her guilt from what she'd done to herself had brought her back to herself. And she had felt much better about herself as she realized she too was a woman of the belt.</p> <p>The first time she had been with another man was her eighteenth birthday. She was the fourth and a virgin; she thought it might be awkward for her until she came along. She had just had a minor orgasm, but it had left her feeling good. She wanted more and she knew that by her own standards the feeling would have been better.</p> <p>She had found that on her own, women were much better, though it was easy to see it in their attitudes, if not their appearance. One such person as a girl, who had been in her teen years, had once been a little hesitant about going out after she had had a few drinks. And now after two weeks of her junior year, when the thought of going home with her had suddenly crossed her mind, she had taken that decision out of her hand.</p> <p>She had gone home with that man, and she didn't even have to think about it, as her inhibitions were gone and she wanted to go with him. It had seemed so strange, to be alone with him at home, knowing that you could have a real relationship. But she had to admit there were advantages to spending time with a man like Jack. So there were advantages, and she was glad that her parents still had the nice old house she had lived in when she first arrived. He was a nice guy, and she liked the idea of spending more time with him.</p> <p>Their first date at the end of her junior year had been pleasant and very innocent. They had talked some, and he seemed to understand most of what it meant to be with a woman. Then the next date happened very unexpectedly, and he had put his arms around her as she was leaving, and they had gone through the door and down the stairs for some brief seconds of passion. She had been so shocked that he had taken off his jacket. It wasn't a long relationship, and they both went straight to bed.</p> <p>During their relationship from that point on, it was easy to put it down to the wine and affection that his physical relationship with her came with. It was easy to fall in love and she felt it with that man.</p> <p>A couple of times after that, they were in a restaurant, and he had the sense to stop her with a light-hearted remark, and even a brief kiss. Of course she had to admit that to herself a woman had to make that kind of effort to attract a guy to her for the right reason. Most women went that way, if they had the desire, and if they wanted to make the commitment. She felt that she had no inhibitions in her own body and that she could be bold enough to ask Jack to kiss her and touch her.</p> <p>The date with Jack had, however, ended by time she had been going home and back alone. He had suggested going out, and she had agreed readily. They had left her car at the curb and he suggested she went down to the front door and ring the bell. She had hesitated, then went to the door and rang the bell. He opened the door, and as always, there was a man there, an older man, who looked her up and down, and she was struck with the combination of his age and how very sexy he looked.</p> <p>"Hello, are you Jack?" She had answered when she rang the doorbell.</p> <p>"That's me," he said. "You are Elizabeth," he said, extending his hand, "and this is Jack."</p> <p>She stood there and shook his hand, "and this is Elizabeth."</p> <p>"Please come inside," he said, leading her into the kitchen.</p> <p>"Thank you for inviting me in," she said. "That's quite a dinner you have set in motion. If there is anything you want to know about our relationship, just let me know."</p> <p>"Jack wants to date a woman. He does not know any better," he said very matter-of-factly. He took her in his arms and she felt his strong arms around her. "Elizabeth, I will tell you all about this at dinner, as we'll both know the answer when you're ready."</p> <p>"There's an end to all that," she said, "or should I say all of our future dates."</p> <p>"In other words," he said, "I can get away with telling you all about how and what I enjoy most with women, and how I feel about them, and how many different, good looking, and sexy ones I should beâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
