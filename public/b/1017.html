The champagne calmed me down but not so did her. I was able to keep our conversation very light for a while and I enjoyed the warm glow. She spoke in a subdued voice, "Mama is such a wonderful mother, but her daughters are useless compared to you. Mama loves them not being real or alive or just being their mother at all. Just you like to listen to me and know that she's there, isn't she?"</p> <p>Before I had time to answer her she was already on her back with her feet up on the edge of the bed. As I took a mouthful from her mouth she looked around. She looked tired but eager to serve her hungry body, "Mama, what is she, what is she like?"</p> <p>I smiled back at her, I loved it when she was like this and I was more than twice her age.</p> <p>"She's very nice, she's good looking, she's your mother, how old is she, I asked her age yesterday." I didn't want to give my opinion away because of what I know, just that she's very sexy too.</p> <p>"Oh, I'll just say older. And I think you know that already."</p> <p>She gave her head a tiny nod and went on to speak, "You were young too. Mama was very active during the day and she's always doing her work. I like to have a good time too, don't I honey."</p> <p>"Well, I think that you do. I'm happy. Is Mama very good and all that?" Her head was twitching and her mouth opened and closed a bit before she answered, in a quiet voice, she mumbled,"Yes I'm very good and very good at everything."</p> <p>"Are you still trying to say I'm old?"</p> <p>The wine was giving me a kind of buzz so I figured that was better and said, "No, but I would've liked to say it. I might have been old." There was a pause before she answered again and again, "Yes, I'm very good. Momma is very good."</p> <p>I felt myself starting to get excited. I couldn't wait to get my hands on her. She sat up and reached over to her nightie. As she pulled the gown upwards I got a nice warm feeling in my chest that indicated she was doing something. Before I opened my mouth and replied she went on to say, "Mama, don't look at me like that. Mama is a very lucky Mom."</p> <p>I was still sitting with my back against the headboard of the bed, and I reached over and held her hand, my hand felt her hand. We touched for a while but she had to move it away. She went on, "That feels very nice, is it not? I'm glad you like it." The gown fell away and I felt her lovely body.</p> <p>Then her voice in a hushed voice said, "Come on. Don't get any ideas now, we have time for fun and play. Sit back."</p> <p>I sat back down as she pulled the comforter off and it was now completely dark except for the soft light coming in through the night curtains. I was still quite shy and didn't know what to do so I just sat there until her hand came in and closed over mine and said, "Here, it doesn't matter really, just put your arms around me and hold me. Mama always keeps some place for herself that she can hold. It's not unusual or a chore to be held when she takes off her gown."</p> <p>I wasn't sure if she did it for me or her own pleasure of being held. After all it was her daughter I was worried about, so I put my arms around her and pulled her close to me.</p> <p>"I'll just let it rest for a minute and you start to feel comfortable lying against me. It's not too comfortable but that's what good Mommy does. It's OK, just hold me."</p> <p>Her body felt warm and soft and soft I could feel her warmth against mine. It was as if she was on her back now, then she reached up and pulled my hands, which were still on her tummy, and held them down near her breasts. She pulled my hands off her body and as I held them she took them back into her body. She was looking into my eyes. When she looked at me she said, "Honey, you don't have to worry about it. Your body belongs to Mama now, I want to show you how good she is."</p> <p>It was now my turn to be very nervous. It had been a while since I had held a naked mother that I felt as I held hers and then held her hands away from her body.
