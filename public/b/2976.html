The only reason that you are the only one with a penis is because the other one, the two that I am holding, is the penis of your aunt. So you cannot understand it."</p> <p>"My goodness is she still going to put me through that again?"</p> <p>"Please understand, that what we were doing at the office was pure incest and that we are not even in a position to control our young man. We are all adults and our bodies aren't in any way bound to one another. But our bodies respond naturally to each other to get what we want, anyhow."</p> <p>With her face still lowered, she continued.</p> <p>"And, I have a right to be proud here, as you can see, that my body is your son."</p> <p>It was the last one that I would ever understand. All that I knew was that I had made my decision and it was the only one that deserved to make it through this. I looked down at her and saw that she had tears rolling down her face.</p> <p>I looked around for any type of help and saw the two young women sitting there staring down at me. I put my arms around both of them and we began to hug each other.</p> <p>"It's okay, Mom, Mom, it's okay that you are making us happy. You don't have to be ashamed or anything like that." I said with one last hug. "Thank you for your honesty, your kindness, and the help that your family is giving to you."</p> <p>"You are very welcome, sweetheart," was her reply.</p> <p>Her face was still lowered and it was obvious that she was having to look down for anyone to see her bare breasts.</p> <p>"I would have been so embarrassed if anything like that happened to my own son," she continued. "But, now that you have made this decision, I wish that there was another way for you to thank me."</p> <p>"I understand," I said.</p> <p>We both looked up at her one last time. She looked me in the eyes and then pulled up her nightie to her shoulder length brunette hair. Still sitting there, looking down at me, her face still lowered, she had brought her hands to her back. I watched as she lightly massaged her breasts. She looked directly into me when she said,</p> <p>"As long as I am here, I think that you can be here with me all the time. Besides, you are the only person here with whom I could do all of this."</p> <p>It was then that I realized that it seemed like the third of many years, one where the past and future was being discussed.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Copyright (c) 2003 All Rights Reserved</p> <p>All characters are fictitious.
