I was in a strange place, and I could have come any second.</p> <p>“Good morning,” she said, kissing me on the lips, “I can’t get enough of you today,” she said, kissing me right on the lips, “I feel so much better” she said, kissing me again.</p> <p>"Well, I think I may be up for some shopping tomorrow," she said with a giggle, "I really hope you didn’t fall asleep in the bar."</p> <p>"Oh, I don’t think that’s a problem,” I replied, smiling, "we can’t tell anyone here, I’m not even sure we'd go for that." .I knew I didn’t want to have some kind of group sex on the side.</p> <p>"Not at all,” she said, "I like shopping with you, and I’ll even help you with something else, that’s why I’m here.” I could feel my cock hardening as she spoke, and she noticed.</p> <p>"Is this what you want, my boyfriend?" she asked, as she pulled the sheet off of me. "Maybe we should go get some lunch to celebrate,” she said with a laugh as she pulled my arms behind my back, turning me onto my back.</p> <p>"Sure,” I replied, "I could eat anything you like.” .I felt she slid herself up me until she was straddling me, her naked breasts pressing against my chest. She kissed me passionately, and ran her hand down over my chest, over my stomach, across my erection, and finally down to my testicles.</p> <p>She took it into her mouth and sucked it, flicking her tongue around it for a minute. She released her mouth long enough as it hardened, and pressed her finger against my slit. “Mmmh," she moaned at first, “I don’t want any soap inside me, but I’ll take care of that later,” she answered, smiling devilishly.</p> <p>She slid down my body, kissing my cock and balls, as she kissed her way down to my anus. She licked my anus for a while, and then kissed her way back up behind my back, licking at my anus once again.</p> <p>Suddenly I felt her tongue licking my anus. She gently tongued me, causing me to tense up. She continued licking my anus for a while, and then finally got her tongue to my anus. She worked back and forth, up and down, up and down, licking me all around the area. My anus opened up for her tongue to enter me, and I felt it in my anus, probing my hole, pushing my anus toward my stomach.</p> <p>She kept licking my anus, and then moved up into my anus, and began to press her tongue against my anus.</p> <p>"Ohhhh," I moaned, “That’s incredible,” I replied. “I was hoping for that.”</p> <p>She began to tongue and probe me, gradually pushing her tongue deeper into my anus.</p> <p>"Unnnnnnghhhhhhhh!" I moaned, “that feels soooo good!" I said.</p> <p>"I’m glad you like it,” she replied, “but I think it’s about time for me to put a stop to my dirty talk."</p> <p>Slowly she moved down the bed to where my penis was. She gently pulled my penis into her mouth, as she used her hand on my penis to move my penis in and out of her mouth. She sucked me as she moved her head up and down.</p> <p>"Mmmhh, that feels sooooo fucking good," I said, “I could come from just this!" Her eyes never left mine as she fucked me with her mouth. “Ohhhh, you feel so good!" I said, feeling that wonderful pressure building up inside of me.</p> <p>"I’m gonna come, if you keep doing that," I said, "Please stop!"</p> <p>She stopped sucking me, and stood up off of me on her hands and knees. She turned around and leaned her body over my face. I could look at her wet and dripping pussy as she sucked my cock, tasting her.</p> <p>"Yes!" I moaned, “lick my pussy,” as I felt my orgasm building.</p> <p>She—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
