Maybe we'll do the same thing again."</p> <p>"Yes, please do."</p> <p>Beneath her she felt his cock, hard, hot and swollen, pulsing in her hand; it was the first time she moved it back and forth but she felt the need for it. Then suddenly he stood up, turned her to face him and she felt his cock head press against her lips.</p> <p>He pushed forward, a little at a time, it slipped in almost past her lips until he was against her. He grabbed her hand and put it between us and guided his cock into her hand.</p> <p>Her other hand found my cock and felt for herself. Soon it was hard as steel; hard for both of us.</p> <p>"Oh my god this feels so good."</p> <p>"It is, it is."</p> <p>His cock was deep to the back of her throat, she could feel the shaft as it passed her lips and down her throat.</p> <p>"Oh god. Oh yeah fuck this feels so hot."</p> <p>"Do you feel it?"</p> <p>"Yes, fuck yes feels so good."</p> <p>"Oh god, I feel it. It is, it is so hard. It's bigger than Dave's. Oh god, do it baby, do it."</p> <p>"Fuck me, fuck me."</p> <p>His cock was so hard she was afraid he was going to shove it into her.</p> <p>But he moved his hands slowly pulling her head off and then pushing her down just that little bit so she was lying with my cock in her mouth; her fingers in my balls and his cock in her hand.</p> <p>It was hot, wet and throbbing and she felt as if she were going to cum a hundred times. Then she felt it. It started in her throat then, then moved her head in small circles. She heard herself moan louder as she could feel it move in her guts. Then he pushed forward just a little but it went in. It went in her mouth, in her throat. He pulled it out again just a little and she could feel it slip and slide down, into her throat; she pulled it out again. I was all the way in her, hard, hard and I was so fucking long in her.</p> <p>"Oh, do that again. You're going to cum, I'm going to cum too."</p> <p>So it was happening, suddenly she wanted it and she didn't care. She was his fuck me; his little pussy-pussy; she wanted it and she needed it.</p> <p>I started rubbing my cock with her hands and he had it in her other hand. Their mouths worked each other, me in her mouth and him in her. She started to cum again and I watched her face as she was enjoying it. I could feel a sense of triumph and pleasure, happiness, love and arousal; a sense of conquest, her pleasure had turned into lust.</p> <p>As she came my strokes were slow at first with their own rhythm to hers, so my cock was fully in her hand. She felt my hands on the bed and she looked up to see that I was fucking her pussy. She wanted it again, wanted it hard, wanted a long hard thrust and she really did. That made me fuck her hard, I felt her muscles clench and release over and over again.</p> <p>I felt my cock pulsing just a little more and knew it was time because I wasn't going to last one more second. My hand was flying in and out of her mouth faster and faster and when I came I felt her body give way.</p> <p>When I came it was a long and drawn out orgasm. She felt a warmth in her hips and all around her. His cock in her mouth, his cock in her pussy. I felt my cum shooting in her throat; she gulped it down and swallowed it as fast as she could. She felt it, felt the hot cum in her belly as well. I heard him moan against her mouth; I felt it in our hearts as well and it didn't bother us any.</p> <p>And yet, that pleasure I felt in her pussy. And she did it again. We took it together. She kissed me deeply on the mouth and felt it there too, we kissed for nearly a minute. It lasted. I thought we were finished. I kissed her for several minutes.</p> <p>I was in a world of our own again; we talked, talked of life, about sex, about what we'd just done. And in the dark of night we talked of our lives together.</p> <p>"So, how do you feel about it?"</p> <p>"Well, I'm happy we're both having the time of our lives now, yes, I still feel guilty about it, but maybe we shouldn't have done thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
