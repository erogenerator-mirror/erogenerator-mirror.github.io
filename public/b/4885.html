I said. "I want it to last." I finished. "But then you have to tell me what you want me to do next."</p> <p>She smiled.</p> <p>"It is going to be fun." She said simply. I think she said if we did it, I would do it. If we did it, I would be on my back between your legs fucking you, sucking and licking your pussy until you screamed your orgasm... But there were no more words. I had to finish. I had to make sure you were satisfied when it was over. Or perhaps afterwards. Maybe even before. I got up.</p> <p>"That was wonderful." I smiled. "If you want to do something else, say so. But we know now we mustn't do it again."</p> <p>"But I want to. And I want you to be satisfied. So please, let's do it again. It will be worth waiting for."</p> <p>I felt a little better then. I wasn't a virgin and still no one had ever taken it so quickly. So, why wasn't I now? And what about me. I've always been pretty open about my sexual experience, so did this girl. She said I had made my own mind up. That this was where I wanted to be. And I wouldn't mind waiting one more time. And, for that matter, I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted to do. If I did it, it would be fun, because I was happy and wanted to do it. But it would be the same for her too!</p> <p>"Thank you. It was wonderful!" I said, then got out a few moments later. "You can bring your friend over now. There are towels right here in the door to the bathroom."</p> <p>I took it and was able to use the shower for a while first, washing my body under the water. I think I might have been feeling the excitement of the moment. When the warm water was gone, I stood up. Tugging, I quickly wrapped the towel around my waist, so I was completely naked and covered only by the towel.</p> <p>"Come and join me in the shower." I said over the sound of the shower. I turned and stepped into the hot stream. "I want to feel your skin next to mine again." I said as I looked her deeply. "I want to make sure I was never more ready for you." With that, I began kissing her lips, gently at first, then with more passion. I opened her lips and started to suck her tongue as it grew in my mouth. Slowly, I slid it's way inside and started to suck it's length too. She let out a small sigh of pleasure.</p> <p>As I slid my hand down her thigh, over the towel's edge, till it settled over her pussy, I heard her moans of excitement. I lifted her ass, and began to slide the towel out from under her, so it covered her pussy completely. I stopped on her thighs and lifted them over, so my fingers could slip under the towel. Her hands were on my head, pulling me closer to her pussy. She began to groan softly.</p> <p>I took my time about sliding the towel up around her thighs, but just stopped to lick and kiss and suck that beautiful pussy. I could feel both my excitement and that feeling of the towel's softness against my sensitive skin. I knew that I would enjoy this.</p> <p>As I sucked her lips and clit, I pressed my hands down on her thighs, which spread far apart more. My nose was against her clit, and I moved and pressed her legs even further apart. She moaned and groaned louder. "Oh! Don't stop!" she begged.</p> <p>"Oh, no," I said, "that feels so good!" As I kissed her clit a bit, I moved my fingers faster, and started to rub her g-spot even more, with more force. "Fuuucckk!" she said. "God! I'm almost there," she said.</p> <p>"I want to feel your muscles contract on my fingers," I said. I knew from her moans that she really was close.</p> <p>"Oh, God!" she said. "Do it, baby!" I continued rubbing her and her muscles, then pressed on it, then pushed a little, then a little more, and pressed it hard with my finger on her g-spot. "Now... Oh! Now!" she said.</p> <p>"Oh!" she said again. As the waves of orgasm began to rock, she pulled the towel higher on her body. It held me in place and kept her close. Her breathing was getting more rapid, though at first I thought she was still going to come, but I knew it was only a few seconds!
