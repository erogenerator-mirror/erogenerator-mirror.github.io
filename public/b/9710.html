She replies in an almost mocking tone. "I just thought," she pauses, then continues, "if someone like you would ever get tired of being so horny to do all this, I'm sure that you would be hard. But, we're good at keeping our standards up high."</p> <p>"Oh I am," I reply.</p> <p>"If we were going to be bad, and if your penis wouldn't be hard enough, we'd better give you a break." And with that, she picks up my hand again, and walks me back to the bar. This time, my dick is again rock hard. And this time, no matter how we approach the table, she won't let go of my hand.</p> <p>"I like it," she whispers in my ear, "we should do it again."</p> <p>I respond by kissing her neck, and begin fondling her breasts through her blouse. I can feel the nipples already growing erect under my fingers.</p> <p>After a couple of minutes on the floor, we get up and head up to our seats. Before I sit, she grabs my hand and pulls me out into the back. The lights are dimming with the music and people are starting to wander our way. After a few minutes of standing back to back, in only her thong, all eyes are on me. I look into her eyes.</p> <p>She gives me a quick look, and then looks down to where her blouse is showing the softest cleavage. After a couple of moments, her gaze lifts up so that she makes eye contact with me and then we begin to sway to the music. Our tits press close to each other and our nipples are now rubbing together.</p> <p>The movement of her body also makes us both lose our balance. And my hands are now at her crotch. She wraps her fingers around my cock, and begins to stroke the shaft, the skin is smooth and silky.</p> <p>"You're not the only one who's turned on. Let me get a feel this." She pulls my thong down and slides to the floor. Her hand is now in the opening between my legs to massage my testicles, and it quickly finds my own erection. She presses my thong to my crotch and rubs her finger over my swollen head. Her finger curls around my cock like a cat's tail. Our eyes lock as she begins sucking my dick, slowly down to the base of it, before pulling back up. The sensation of feeling my dick head against this tight wet slit sends a jolt through my entire body.</p> <p>Her hand continues to slowly stroke it up and down. She has now started sliding it up and down, and it is becoming more and more difficult for both of us to hold our position.</p> <p>"Do you want me?" she whispers.</p> <p>"Yes." I reply with enthusiasm.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me." She says.</p> <p>We both stare into each others eyes as she continues sucking me, which is about the same as I was sucking her nipple.</p> <p>"Do you want to fuck me, too?" she asks.</p> <p>I have already pushed my chair to the back seat of the car, so I can lean over to her. One of my knees is on the seat, leaning over to her to kiss her. We kiss passionately.</p> <p>"Make love to me," she whispers.</p> <p>I can't believe this is happening. I've been dreaming about it forever. I'm so turned on. My cock has gone soft. Even in my slacks, it's a different cock to my own.</p> <p>I can't believe what is happening. I can't believe that she has my dick in her hands. She's sucking it, stroking it, kissing it. Her mouth feels so good. Her fingernails are digging into my cheeks.</p> <p>Our mouths are locked in a kiss. Her lips are pressing against mine as her tongue moves closer to my own. I pull forward, so her lips meet mine. I push my tongue hard into her mouth. It's like being with a snake. It's a snake that knows how it will soon have its prey. We're both breathing hard.</p> <p>As our mouths open, I break away and pull her to her feet. My hands travel up her thighs and grab her breast. I knead and fondle them as she takes control. We each pull the other close to get closer to each other. Our legs are now pressed together, and my dick is now hard again, pushing between her thighs.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me, too," she whispers in my ear. She starts rubbing the outside of her wet, bare pussy lips.
