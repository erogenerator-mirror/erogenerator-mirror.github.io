He asked curiously. He was so close to him she could have kissed him right here and right now. Just then she remembered why she was here.</p> <p>"It was the thought of the boys and I..." She tried to explain her thoughts. He simply took her in his arms and held her tight.</p> <p>"It's alright," he said with a smile. Just another time when he didn't want to share her with his brothers. It's ok, she thought. "It was the thought of not having any secrets from mommy. We're not going to do it again until you're old enough. We didn't make you do it, though we love the fact you have to." He assured her with a deep voice. He held her as tight as he knew how to make her feel.</p> <p>"I want to please you no matter what we do. I love you. I want to please you, too. When have you ever thought this much about yourself?" He asked touching her shoulder.</p> <p>"Mmm...I don't know, maybe we've...?" She trailed off unsure if that what she wanted to say.</p> <p>"Just tell me and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Just don't push the issue now." He said leaning down and kissing her forehead. She felt as though she couldn't say another word right now. She felt his mouth press against her lips as he brought his hands up and ran them up her arms and over her head. She could feel his hands pulling her head into his body as he began to run his tongue along her lips.</p> <p>"Mmm...I just know one thing though. I want to take you on a date tomorrow night, and let you feel the rest of the world." He smiled at her as he leaned in to kiss her again. "I know you'd like to have the chance to feel like a real man again. No one will ever know it, right?" He teased playfully.</p> <p>"Of course not." She said laughing as she hugged him tightly. She could feel her heart beating as she did so.</p> <p>"Just promise you'll do that again the next time we get the chance. I can't wait." He assured her with a smile as he kissed her forehead once more.</p> <p>************</p> <p>A couple of days later...</p> <p>************</p> <p>I can't believe how much I am turning in on this. I can't get the picture out of my head and start getting ready. It's been like this since then. The only thing is I still don't want this. Mom and dad must be trying to protect each other. This is so damn wrong. I can't believe this is happening to me. I can't believe it's happening to myself. I'm going out in a week, I could stay in bed all day. I can't even think straight. Why is all this happening? I shouldn't be turning this around at all. I'll lose everything if I go insane.</p> <p>I can't believe we are even having this conversation. What is wrong with me? I can't be this close to someone so I can't really love them for me. I don't even know why I am feeling this way. I am not sure what to do about it at all. I don't know what to expect from today, but I'm excited. I've decided not to change my job so I could go shopping tomorrow. I'm going to just go home to mom's and go to bed. I can't have sex with her without thinking about dad. I've just figured it out.</p> <p>He knows I'm leaving tomorrow. I'm just going to watch my parents while they're having sex together and let that play out. I know what she's doing right now. I can tell she loves it. I can also sense how she is enjoying it, too. It's obvious they are having a good time at the bachelor party.</p> <p>After I'm gone, I want to tell mom and dad this morning. I can't hold back and tell them about it, but I might do that later. I hope she still feels as comfortable with me as I am now. I'm hoping she will also tell them as well. As I sit at my desk I can't really describe how I feel, but I have to tell it. I don't want them to keep seeing what happened here. I think mom loves them the same way I do. That night she went to get her keys for the wedding. She didn't look up as she drove home. She didn't look at me when she answered the door, but she didn't say anything when she opened it. She didn't look out the window again. Mom's a good girl. Mom loves sex. If she just showed it off more, maybe we could manage to have full sex with herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
