"No, I can't!" I exclaimed.</p> <p>He laughed and reached down to pull off his shorts. This elicited a laugh from the others.</p> <p>"He is wearing a condom," Kate said.</p> <p>"Yes! I just did," Rachel interjected. "I know." She continued to laugh.</p> <p>I had to fight hard to refrain from laughing. I was suddenly aware of being so excited about the situation. I was very aroused. What my body was feeling was beyond what I knew was normal.</p> <p>I suddenly realized that everyone had been watching us.</p> <p>"Wow!" I exclaimed.</p> <p>"He's naked, do you all mean?" Kate asked Rachel.</p> <p>"We're naked!" Rachel laughed again.</p> <p>"Yes, all of you," I responded.</p> <p>Kate pulled down her panties and her panties did too.</p> <p>The other four girls had also removed their panties now too?</p> <p>I wanted to say something to them or just hold up to Kate.</p> <p>But I refrained.</p> <p>"Sorry." I stammered. "That was so sexy."</p> <p>I looked over at Rachel.</p> <p>"I am sure!"</p> <p>"I hope we can all have a turn," Kate stated.</p> <p>They were all wearing panties and bras!</p> <p>"I hope so too" I said.</p> <p>Kate walked ahead of me towards the edge of the pool.</p> <p>I was so aroused I had no intention to go swimming. I just looked at her legs. I could see the outline of her panties. Her calves were slender and well formed. Her thighs were slender all the way to her knees.</p> <p>I wanted her so badly.</p> <p>"Come stand next to me," I told her.</p> <p>She turned toward me and I placed my hands on her waist.</p> <p>I was so sexually energized by this time that I was able to move my hands downward.</p> <p>She moved her arms from my shoulders.</p> <p>I placed my hands in her stomach.</p> <p>The bra straps were still on her shoulders.</p> <p>I pulled the straps off.</p> <p>She smiled at me.</p> <p>Slowly I removed her panties from her body.</p> <p>I was so aroused that I did a little jumping dance on her. She smiled back at me as we stood in front of each other, in the shallow end of the pool.</p> <p>"I guess you two are having fun."</p> <p>Kate turned to the other side.</p> <p>"I guess so," she said as she bent over to untie the bow on her bra.</p> <p>"Oh, God!" she said. "I'm really looking forward to this."</p> <p>They were both naked now. We all had our tops on.</p> <p>I could see the outline of the others panties on Rachel's legs.</p> <p>I turned to look at her.</p> <p>"I really like your panties," I told her.</p> <p>"They're new too!" I added before lowering my face.</p> <p>She smiled at me and leaned in as our lips met.</p> <p>I felt her tongue slip out of my mouth.</p> <p>I turned her around to face me. Our lips touched.</p> <p>Our lips touched.</p> <p>I felt myself responding. I felt myself getting aroused again.</p> <p>We pressed our lips together. Our kiss moved our tongues.</p> <p>We kissed and we kissed.</p> <p>For an instant, there was only one sensation of us. Our lips pressed together. Our kiss moved to the other.</p> <p>One hand was behind each of their heads.</p> <p>The other was on the small of their backs, pushing them closer together.</p> <p>Our kiss continued. Our tongues pressed against each other.</p> <p>We were becoming closer.</p> <p>We moved our hands from the small of their backs to each others feet.</p> <p>We walked with each other a few steps.</p> <p>We walked around one another. We were almost face to face.</p> <p>Once we got to the end of the pool, we walked over to the other house.</p> <p>There was an electric fireplace in the far corner of the pool.</p> <p>"This is your hot tub?" Rachel exclaimed.</p> <p>"Yes!" Rachel agreed.</p> <p>We walked down the pool side of the large hot tub. The door to this house was open and two people could open the door without a problem.</p> <p>We walked to the steps on each side of the hot tub.</p> <p>Rachel and Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
