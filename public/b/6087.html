Yes," I purred, swallowing his cum. "You taste so good."</p> <p>"You're the best, baby. Thank you."</p> <p>"Ohhhhhhh," he groaned as I slipped his deflating penis out of my mouth. I was still holding onto him, licking all the come from his face, watching his body stiffen in my hand.</p> <p>I lay down next to him. Our chests pressed to each other, the sweat of excitement glistening on us.</p> <p>I kissed him, tasting the last of the salty-clear liquid from his mouth.</p> <p>"You're delicious."</p> <p>"Thank you."</p> <p>"So is that what you do, after school," he laughed, pushing the t-shirt over my body. "You have to go and help work some customers in the store," he laughed again. "Then you can go topless, you little minx."</p> <p>"Oh, no...don't get the wrong idea....but thank you," I said, laying back and relaxing, enjoying the gentle strokes of his soft, warm hands.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm so sorry, I really didn't mean to. It's just that," he said. "It's so easy to have sex in all your classes, but for some reason I just couldn't go through with it."</p> <p>"Oh, we'll just have to do it some other time," I replied, reaching down to my skirt and pulling it up.</p> <p>"Oh...uh, okay," he replied, pulling me up.</p> <p>"Don't you dare get dressed, you little slut," I admonished as he pushed my skirt up and up.</p> <p>We kissed again and I felt him run his hand through my hair.</p> <p>"You're a beautiful girl," he said, taking me home.</p> <p>I loved the way his words touched and tingled and he made me feel so feminine.</p> <p>I felt the sting of the slap that the first slap brought and I cried out, laughing softly against his lips. God, he made me so happy.</p> <p>"You have so much fun."</p> <p>I smiled up at him. "I am your sweet girl."</p> <p>We walked home, feeling each other's muscles as we walked.</p> <p>"So where'll we start," I said. "What were the last few minutes like," she asked.</p> <p>"We'll have to get home to our boring, boring lives, just to have some fun."</p> <p>"Oh yes, you'll have to join in," I teased.</p> <p>"I'll bet you'd like to join in too."</p> <p>"I'd like to join in," I purred, rolling my eyes in his direction.</p> <p>We walked on, each with our free hand, admiring the scenery as we did so.</p> <p>We walked a while longer without saying anything.</p> <p>"Maybe we should get some fresh air," I suggested.</p> <p>"I think we'll need to head back home," he replied.</p> <p>"I do not want to get cold feet again. It's been a long few nights. And, I'm sure some of your clients wouldn't approve," I advised.</p> <p>"They don't really, they just want to see what happens and see if they can't do something about it."</p> <p>We walked on, admiring the scenery when we noticed a couple walking by that we knew.</p> <p>"It turns out they have some really hot guys in there. Maybe we should get ourselves cleaned up and get out of here," I suggested.</p> <p>"But, we can't, oh, I'll come," he whimpered back.</p> <p>"Maybe we canâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
