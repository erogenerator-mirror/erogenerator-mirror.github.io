Her skin was creamy white and flawless, especially her nipples were small and pink. Her stomach was flat, but I've always been a breast man, I love a nice round ass. However, it was her face that really grabbed my attention. That beauty that I've never seen before.</p> <p>Her eyes were always focused with my eyes, and she could light up by smiling all day. I've always loved the smooth silky red hair, and her lips that had just been kissed. Her smile was always sensual, and in no time, I'd love to taste my dear sister.</p> <p>"Can I just hold your hand so I can kiss it, Sam?" That simple request made me feel all of a sudden nervous. I was always apprehensive about what would happen if this happened.</p> <p>"Please, Sam, its alright." She replied, her eyes opening and letting me see that she was holding this beautiful face with all innocence and vulnerability.</p> <p>I loved it when I held her hand. She was a doll, but even though she was still in my family, I could still see the joy and happiness that she had when she brought me happiness. It made me smile and I thought of those times when I felt the same way and just wanted to hold her as she was holding me.</p> <p>Slowly, we sat next to each other next to each other. Her arm went to my body below my lap and she held there, smiling at me, and looking up at me. Then, she was quiet a moment, but she didn't let go of my hand. I let my hand reach out for her and she took it right there. She let my hand slowly fall on the warm smooth skin of her thigh.</p> <p>"I've thought about this many nights," she said, her voice just a bit breathless, "I had to do something. I couldn't think what would happen if someone else had seen how the night was coming."</p> <p>I could feel myself becoming aroused, and I knew that she felt it too, but we didn't say anything.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" she asked.</p> <p>"Its just that..." I asked.</p> <p>"Oh, I've thought of it before," she said looking at me earnestly, "It had to do with our lives. There were many times in my life I would just stay alone and wonder. When I felt the need in a certain someone I'd just give up. I never would have gone for someone else, but I loved you."</p> <p>"Oh, sis, that was lovely." I said and looked down at her, and when my fingers crossed her thigh, I realized that I was holding something else besides her body.</p> <p>"I've had the need for you often," I said, "I love all men like you that I've got and love looking at the beauty of your body that I see. When were you a virgin Sam?"</p> <p>There was a moment of quiet, and then she gave a smile, "You know, I was not a virgin, you know?"</p> <p>"I know your age," I said.</p> <p>"Oh yes, I know that," she said, "I was just like you are not. When I saw you lying naked in bed in the dorm, I had to stop myself. I couldn't sleep that way... I just couldn't sleep... I never thought about it that way," she said, "that I had the urge to have sex..."</p> <p>"I understand," I said. So much for taking a deep breath, "it just never occurred to me that you would have an urge to have sex."</p> <p>"My body was the same way and I liked the same body parts, you know?" she said and held my hand again.</p> <p>"It's been years since I have felt anything so good," I said and looked up at her. She smiled again and held my hand to her face.</p> <p>"Maybe it's true, but, I think we're all different," she said.</p> <p>"Me? In what way?" I asked, getting all flushed and nervous now.</p> <p>"Well, I'll just have to tell you the whole story, but if you'd like to, I can give you the story by hand. What I'm going to say is that I didn't know it would turn into such a great experience. Now, let's get you in the showers and then you'll be ready to go."</p> <p>I hesitated, not sure exactly what to say. She smiled again, and in a moment she had me in her arms again, and she had dried me off by pulling me onto the couch. There was little I could do but just lay there and let her do her thing. I could feel her tongue between my legs as she worked on me. This was her timeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
