We finished the coffee then we got up and went downstairs. When we got back, I saw that they were on their second bottle of wine, and I could tell by the look on their faces that they must be enjoying our night of passion.</p> <p>We sat around the table again talking and laughing until we were all exhausted and sat back in the chair. "I thought we were going to be at a nude resort for a few weeks," Sally said to the guys. They weren't really sure how things would go from there though, and since they were both older, it was apparent it wasn't just for business. Then it was Sally's turn to tell them, "So, we're headed to the mall for some clothes to wear next week."</p> <p>We all laughed at that idea and as we were about to get up to leave, she held up her hand and said. "Remember what I said about spending as much time at the mall as I can."</p> <p>"Yeah, you're right," I replied smiling.</p> <p>We finished the last bottle of wine and then it was off to the mall. I took the first opportunity to look around the store, and saw that there were several stores for everything. There was some clothing for ladies as well, dresses, halter tops, skirts and tops, as well as some men's clothes. I bought several things for the rest of the day, but then Sally had to get back to the house. We started walking back to the house, but Sally stopped me and said. "I don't think I can take all our fun, but we probably weren't as drunk as we thought we were."</p> <p>I told her that I sure could, and that I'd have to go shopping and pick something out for her. I wasn't going to go looking at any of the clothes that she'd mentioned. I asked her if she'd have it, and she said sure, it would be fun shopping. On our way back she told me where to shop, and I found a dress that I thought she was going to wear to the nude resort tomorrow night.</p> <p>We had the best time shopping at the lingerie section on our way back. She wore a white see through baby doll dress that was cut just above her belly button. It was short enough to show off her legs, and it showed just a hint of her tits. Underneath, she wore nothing but a pair of white fishnet stockings. I tried on a pair, and sure enough, I did a good job.</p> <p>When we came around the side of the house, we found a very nice looking bathing suit that fit her well and she put it on. Sally was wearing a pair of light blue jeans and a pair of sandals.</p> <p>Sally looked great in that suit, and I thought she did too.</p> <p>"So, we should get ready then for the big party tonight," Sue suggested. We agreed and we headed upstairs and took a shower. It was a wonderful shower, and we soaped each others bodies up thoroughly. "If this is what Sally has in mind for tomorrow night," I thought.</p> <p>The plan that evening was to have a light dinner in the town restaurant and a light lunch in the mall, which Sally and I was going to go on. It was going to be a very fun evening.</p> <p>Sally and I had plans for the following evening. First she was going shopping, and she needed to be back home by 4 o'clock. She had no plans, but she didn't have time to get a babysitter for the next four months either. After our shower, we went to dinner, then went to the mall and got ready for the party.</p> <p>Sally had been wearing a pair of black dress that showed off a good portion of her lovely legs. It was the sort of dress that really accentuated her shapely thighs and ass, but she thought she looked good enough to drive a man insane. We picked out a dress with lots of the usual lines and was ready to go. We arrived at the mall and she went into one of the stores in the mall, while I went in and got a bottle of wine to bring along for the evening. The music that was going on as we walked in was the "Tyrone" by The Cassidy.</p> <p>We got to the front counter and were greeted by some women that looked to be in their 50's or 60's, and a couple of them that looked to be in their 50's or 60's. They had very dark brown hair that were in tight pigtails. They were obviously very successful in their business. On the one hand, they looked like models, but with that beautiful face and those fantastic tits.</p> <p>On the other hand, most of them seemed to notice Sally's body, and theyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
