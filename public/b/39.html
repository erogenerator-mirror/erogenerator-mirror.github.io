I guess.</p> <p>I don't remember it being that late or anything, and it's probably what it's like to get to that first class. You don't think that the girl you were with before was now that pretty.</p> <p>But who cares. I didn't mean to pry, and I certainly didn't mean to hurt your feelings. But I guess I was still thinking about the day.</p> <p>I'd only been with a few guys, I wasn't sure of the relationship. It felt really weird that I'd brought it up. But after a couple weeks I think I kind of got over the initial shock, that I'm finally feeling free, with you. And you don't seem to mind.</p> <p>I kind of liked the change. I like thinking that, if you wanted to feel free to go back and do anything you want.</p> <p>Except for those times, when we were in the office, but we were still alone. It's not like you have to do anything, I'm a busy girl I don't have the energy to do that. And now, when I come back to the office, all the work is done. That's my life. I don't have a lot of free time though.</p> <p>You can make the most of whatever time you have.</p> <p>When was the last time I had a chance to go to the bathroom? You never say.</p> <p>When I got to your classroom after class, I didn't say any words.</p> <p>I really wasn't expecting some weird shit to happen between you, but if it did, it worked out.</p> <p>A couple weeks later, we were in the backseat of your car.</p> <p>"Hey, I'm just going to get some ice," I said.</p> <p>"Oh, ok, just a sec," you replied and got out of the car. You weren't even wearing a skirt, that was for sure.</p> <p>While you were driving, I thought about what you said a couple weeks ago.</p> <p>"I want to ask a favor, I think."</p> <p>"What might that be?" you asked.</p> <p>I was already thinking about what you'd been doing the morning, and was suddenly concerned.</p> <p>"Are you going to be nice to me, to call me a bitch and shit, or what, are you going to keep us friends?" I asked.</p> <p>"Honey, I'm really not trying to do something stupid, I just want to know what's going on, and see what's going on with you. I think you're going to be very happy."</p> <p>"We don't want to make you feel like a bitch at work. We just want you to be happy. I'm not the bitch, you know."</p> <p>"Yeah, you're being awful, sweetie, but what good is seeing you happy without thinking about your past? Are you going to be happy with me? Yeah, I think so."</p> <p>"Yeah, yeah, I think so. Yeah. It's probably just about time."</p> <p>"I'm not happy with you. You're probably not even the boyfriend."</p> <p>"So what, all you think I'm the boyfriend. You're just going to tell me I'm a bitch right now or you're going to be a bitch again later. So that's not a boyfriend. If you aren't the boyfriend, then who do you think I am after my last class today? I'm not the boyfriend" I said.</p> <p>"I'll give you another chance, honey. Please, you're worth waiting for. Please?"</p> <p>"Okay, I am worth waiting for. Maybe I can find another guy. I don't get it, but I am willing to wait. But you're not going to be too happy with me."</p> <p>"I don't want to keep you. I'm not that good of a boyfriend. You're not the boy anymore. You're just a friend or something. It's like you just left me."</p> <p>"Oh, really?"</p> <p>"Yeah really. I just meant. You don't have a girl all to yourself either."</p> <p>"Whatever, let me up to change."</p> <p>"Oh, I understand. I can't promise anything, honey. I'll just go take a shower, and when I get out, I might be too tired to do anything else. I just might not be able to tell you the real story when I get out of my car."</p> <p>"Yeah, I understand. I'll just come back and see you on Friday. Are you coming back here this weekend?"</p> <p>"I don't usually come over on Saturdays, but maybe tomorrow night? I'm trying to help out a friend with his book."</p> <p>"You know, one ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
