That's what we usually do. I guess you could go for a walk."</p> <p>I smiled back at her and was surprised to find that I did respond as I usually did. It was all part of the game of teasing. I wasn't sure what to say, what to say, which would set her off, but she certainly began to respond before any of that happened. I let it go to my heart and I wanted to be the one to ask for the answers in the heat of the moment. I had asked, and had heard, many times since our previous evening. She seemed to be getting the message, so I said yes.</p> <p>We sat on the front deck and she was on my right. As we walked, she let her legs open, allowing her left foot to fall toward my lap. I let her leg drop, but not to stop herself, letting it fall back to the deck. After a few steps, she put one arm across my shoulders, and looked deep into my eyes. "You know it's been a good summer."</p> <p>I did not want to ruin the moment by thinking too much about it, so I let my head turn slightly as I offered one last, lingering, eye contact. "Sure, we are, aren't we, Jack?" Her eyes held me in a way that told me she truly meant it. I felt like a boy being reprimanded on the front porch for being late to school for the week. No, it wasn't that – it was something else. The girl in front of me was still holding onto my shoulders, and I did not want to go any farther.</p> <p>"Come on. There is not much in school now anyway." She seemed to understand my situation.</p> <p>"I guess there isn't much in my classes now." We looked at each other again and it seemed as if the moment would never end. She got that look again, and it was not just a glance, but also a look as if she wanted something and wanted it right off her tongue.</p> <p>We went back across the property and started our stroll again, this time through some of the back yards of the property. There were several trees along the edges of the property that allowed us privacy. As we got closer to the house, I let my arm go around her shoulder and lightly stroked her cheek. She responded to my actions immediately, and leaned toward me. I kissed her on the lips, and she responded in kind. When we came up for air, a sly grin crept into my eyes.</p> <p>My brain was aching for a few moments in an effort to focus and then I realized what we had done. Even after her kiss had ended, there seemed to be an impasse. Then I felt a nervous tingle in my chest, and suddenly she grabbed my hand and said, "I have been really hoping you might be there." It was the first of many smiles of the night.</p> <p>"Me too. The way I feel in your arms. It just feels good. And, I hope we get to do this sometime in the future."</p> <p>"I'll see what I can do and be sure it will be good for you." I said, and she laughed.</p> <p>"You are so sweet!"</p> <p>"You don't have too bad a taste, do you?" We laughed as I let my hand drift downward to her knee. After a moment, our hands met – the very first time ever I touched another girl. Her body felt soft as I began to lift her foot up onto my lap, letting my fingers slide along her silk-covered knee. I was nervous, but it felt so good to be touched again, and to have her touch me so intimately. She smiled and cooed, and I knew she felt the same way. So the next morning, we sat on the deck together after breakfast.</p> <p>"I want to go inside and enjoy some alone time with my friends. Is that okay?"</p> <p>"Sure. I feel a bit uncomfortable being alone with you alone all the time." She was very open about her thoughts.</p> <p>"I'm going for a walk. Would you like to go down and have a coffee?"</p> <p>"Are you sure?" She asked. "You are not a girl, are you?" She smiled at the thought.</p> <p>"Not at all. Are you?"</p> <p>"Very. Do you work out?" She was right where I found her. Not only did she look fantastic in her little black dress, but her legs were also quite toned, and her bare feet were smooth, as if they had been polished. I would go to work on any foot day day of the week, and when I put my feet on them, I could hardly notice the small bulge in her pants.</p> <p>"I try to do some, and if a woman can do them, you can—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
