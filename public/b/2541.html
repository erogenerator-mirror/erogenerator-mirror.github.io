But just wait, you know what to do."</p> <p>Gina felt she was about to argue. But she was frozen. She couldn't believe this. In less than two hours she'd been through with some very bad things and now she was going to make love to the man who'd made it worse by fucking her mother, best friend, and one of her own. The decision had come slowly, but she knew by this point it was not going to be any other way, at least not by her standards.</p> <p>Gina was surprised when the woman sat up and got back into the car.</p> <p>"Well," she said, "I guess I've done enough." She looked at Gina, with a kind of helplessness. "We'll make love, tonight."</p> <p>"So this is where the party is? We're gonna make love?" Gina asked.</p> <p>"I'll be right there waiting." Gloria smiled. She reached over and turned off the car. She went to Gloria's side with a big hug and a quick kiss on the cheek. "I got you. Now if you don't mind, I need to go help with some of my questions."</p> <p>Gloria was glad to have some things put into perspective instead of pushing the boundaries. She looked at Gina and smiled. If they weren't already part of a friendship, then they sure were a nice couple.</p> <p>Gloria had the same thoughts as everyone else. But this was different. She didn't say much, just looked at Gina with an apprehensive expression on her face. There was one small question though.</p> <p>She was curious about how much her mother might like it.</p> <p>Gina thought for a while, looking into Gloria's eyes. "I think I liked it a lot," she said.</p> <p>"Don't we all," she answered. "I think you're very beautiful," she added as she pulled Gina down so they could kiss. "Especially my mother."</p> <p>Gloria let her tongue slip from Gina's mouth, past her teeth and up along her neck to her ear. She heard Gina's breathing quicken. "You'll enjoy your next story. But I'll say this: I love you too," she said tenderly.</p> <p>Gina smiled back. "I do too."</p> <p>After an hour, the three of them were sitting in their car. Each of them were feeling frisky and ready to go. They didn't want to wait a few more minutes and so Gloria reached in the back seat and pulled out Gina's small bag.</p> <p>"Do you want to try the next question?" she asked as she held up the bag. Gina was surprised as Gloria opened it completely and flipped through several dresses. "Can we look at these," she said, pointing toward themselves.</p> <p>"Yes," Gina said, "you can try them on. There are dresses that could suit us. But just in case, what do you think?"</p> <p>"The next question is, what do I think of these?"</p> <p>"Do you think I could wear?"</p> <p>Gina looked at the dress, realizing then that her mother liked this.</p> <p>"That was for you," she said, "but I still have to think on the next question. I'm glad you asked. Let me know, I'll even try this one on."</p> <p>Gina went up the stairs in the back seat. She opened the third dress, which was already hanging on the back of the door, and tossed it on the floor. She went back and looked at herself in the mirror. "Wow," she said, "that looks nice."</p> <p>Gloria couldn't help but think of her mother. Her mother had always been a very attractive woman, with her tall curves and a killer figure. But right now, her mother was wearing the revealing dress. Gina knew that if she took her eyes off hers, she wouldn't see Gloria looking at her. She leaned back and relaxed into the seat.</p> <p>Gloria had to admit Gloria looked good. Not skinny or curvy like she usually would. She had a lovely figure with a full set of breasts that were perky, yet with the same amount of jiggling that she would in a bikini. Her legs were long and shapely, which were well proportioned. She'd just gone one day shopping and was ready for the day to come when she'd make a decision about whether or not she'd sleep with a client. Gina didn't know this, but she thought that they were both pretty hot, and she wondered whether she'd liked being seduced by this woman. Gina looked at her reflection for a minute. She was beginning to get turned on.</p> <p>"Are you sure of this?" she heard Gloria ask.</p> <p>Gâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
