Well sure it was for a while but that's all good and well. I think I'm just having some fun, but it's not all that fun." I just told her.</p> <p>"Oh it's not all that fun but fun doesn't mean I'm not enjoying it. I mean, you can tell. I mean I know, we're just having a little fun. And, don't try or you will never get laid again." Katie told me.</p> <p>"No, not even once. In fact, that's why I asked you to come." I said.</p> <p>Katie had a look of total confusion. But, she had an almost smirk on her face. I took her hand and pulled her to her feet. I then turned to the guy on the other side of me.</p> <p>"I know that was mean of you to ask me that if I didn't give you a handjob." I said.</p> <p>Katie looked at the guy nervously. I could tell she'd said the wrong thing. Then she got serious.</p> <p>"Come on, lets go back to my office." She said. We headed back to her office. As we walked in I felt her hand rest lightly on my arm. I turned to her and pulled her body to mine. I could feel her soft body pressed tightly to mine. I could feel her tits against my chest and her nipples pressing into my skin. Katie pressed herself fully against me as I held her hand against my chest. Our faces were only inches apart. Our tongues started to flicker in our mouths. I lifted Katie's jacket off in one motion, exposing her stomach. She slid it back her and sat it on the back of her desk. We quickly got her jacket undone and then dropped the jacket on the ground, followed quickly by her blouse. I could not believe how firm, smooth, and flawless her naked flesh was. As I kissed and nibbled on her neck I could feel our bodies grinding together. She felt so soft and smooth, as I felt the wetness between her legs. I looked down her body to see her bare tits pointing skyward. I dropped to my knees and put her blouse on the floor. We stood there for a moment until I lifted Katie into my arms and carried her to my office.</p> <p>"This is the last time you can do this here, OK?" I said. Katie looked at me, her eyes pleading with me. I nodded and she walked with me to my office. Once we got our things and put them away I locked our doors and led Katie into the office. I had only put her things away in my pocket. The more I looked at the clothes inside the bag I had made for them, the more I knew that there was nothing left of what they had looked like when they went to school. I took Katie's hand and led her to my office to look over her notes while we waited.</p> <p>I left her in my office door so that she could finish what she had started. As I pulled on my shirt I watched her as she bent over to pick up the materials. She was so perfect on her long legs. The way her ass moved, from bottom toward top was sexy as hell. I quickly pulled on my jeans and button it up. Katie was on her computer workstation looking over her notes again and reading back them. I turned on one of my little speakers and listened to the computer speakers. I just lay back and relaxed in my chair. When Katie got to the last pages she looked back at me. The way her eyes looked at me I wished I could be the one doing this. As I saw that sparkle in her eyes that told me what I wanted to happen.</p> <p>Katie had just finished what she thought was her final chapter. I reached up and wiped a drop of cum from her upper lip and kissed her. It was just a light brush but it seemed to me that she liked kissing. I took her hand and put on me a warm towel. I sat her on my desk and pulled her top down. I could feel how warm the towel was. I then used my hand to rub her entire pubic area which was hairless from the summer. She was still completely clothed and had a look that I knew well. I moved down and lightly kissed her vagina. Then I kissed it all the way down to that little hole between her legs. When my mouth touched it it almost hurt. It did hurt as I got close to her sex. It was like she wasn't there. I just kissed the top of it again. As I did so I felt her relax against me. Before I reached her entrance, I put my left hand on her shoulder and gently pulled her up into my mouth. I felt the wetness of it and knew that she was a natural. I just had to taste herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
