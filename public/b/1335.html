"Why don't you put on that nice sexy little robe?"</p> <p>"But you look so beautiful!" He said, admiring her beauty in her soft white robe.</p> <p>"Your so handsome!" she responded. "And so sexy!"</p> <p>"Mmm... You make me horny..." he said.</p> <p>"And you made me horny?" she asked him.</p> <p>"Hmm... maybe we shouldn't..." he said. "But what would you like?" he asked.</p> <p>"I don't know." She told him. "I really do want you."</p> <p>"No," he told her. "It won't happen!" he told her.</p> <p>"But what?" she asked him.</p> <p>"We can't!" he protested.</p> <p>"Please," she begged him.</p> <p>"You're afraid?" he asked her.</p> <p>"Yeah... Maybe we shouldn't... we better stop." she thought.</p> <p>"But I have to... I have to see you again..."</p> <p>"It's too late now!" he said angrily.</p> <p>"I know," she said.</p> <p>As the hour approached, the pair of them left the living room while walking back to the elevator.</p> <p>She put on the sexy robe, and they began to make their way back down stairs.</p> <p>She held the door in the middle of her chest, and opened it.</p> <p>"Wow!" she said, staring deep into the eyes of her friend who had just met her.</p> <p>"Yes," she responded, smiling. "You're a sweetie."</p> <p>She hugged and kissed him when they arrived at the stairway.</p> <p>At the top, she pushed him towards the stairs and they were soon at the apartment door.</p> <p>"What happened...?" she asked him.</p> <p>"It couldn't have happened... We kissed each other!" he said. "Now I had to make the second one."</p> <p>"Wow..." she said, again smiling. "How did you? I didn't know what kind of kiss you were going for!"</p> <p>"I was just kidding," he said. "It was only a French kiss!"</p> <p>"You kissed me... now I have to have a French kiss!"</p> <p>"Why wouldn't I?" he asked. "I had no idea you would really kiss me!"</p> <p>"It was so easy to see why it had to happen..." she explained. "It's just for you!"</p> <p>He gave her a smile, and then they both walked into the living room where they quickly sat down on the couch.</p> <p>"Oh my!" she said, surprised. He had a nice view over her shoulder, and then she felt his robe slip off of her, and she looked up into his eyes. A mischievous smile formed on her face.</p> <p>"Wow..." she murmured softly.</p> <p>"So what happened after that...?" he asked.</p> <p>"I don't know," she said. "He had to come back and pick me up today."</p> <p>"I'm so sorry..." he said.</p> <p>"Hey," she said, kissing him again. "That was lovely... I'm so happy you're returning!"</p> <p>She looked at him deeply, and then lifted her eyes to his face, and smiled again.</p> <p>"I see you're glad to be back to me?" she asked him.</p> <p>"You know it!" he said, smiling back. "I know that I'm sorry..."</p> <p>"No, it's okay," she said. "It's just the way you looked at me that made me feel..."</p> <p>That smile was suddenly gone.</p> <p>"You said your parents had sex all the time, right? Right?" he asked.</p> <p>"I did..." she said at last. "And that's all I had to do..."</p> <p>"Okay..." he said. "But it doesn't mean I don't love you anymore!"</p> <p>"I was not thinking like that..." she said, shaking her head. "But I can't say no."</p> <p>"But you can still," he insisted, sitting back down. "You'll always love me!"</p> <p>"I can still!" she told him. "I love you!"</p> <p>When he realized she actually meant it, he smiled.</p> <p>"We'll just have to tell our parents that I was just trying to pick you up from school, and then come back here!" he said.</p> <p>"No...," she protested. "I don't want to let you leave yet!"</p> <p>"You sure that won't happen?" he asked. "What if one of them sees you... that he sees you as he always has before?"</p> <p>"We can't..." she said. "I'm not going to say anythingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
