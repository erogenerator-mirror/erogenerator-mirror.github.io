She said.</p> <p>'I'm Anna.' I said and reached out my hand to her.</p> <p>I was about to give her a friendly hug but then she turned and faced me. She was a vision of beauty: a big smile, full black hair, full lips, and a body that was all mine.</p> <p>I held onto her hand and moved towards her: she followed and we kissed gently.</p> <p>She took my face in her hands and my mouth came to meet hers and our tongues touched in a gentle dance.</p> <p>It was the moment of love we both knew and as we explored each other's sensual mouths with our mouths and our tongues she pushed me onto the lounge with her, I knew I wouldn't last long.</p> <p>Anna stood up and held on to me, both of us could feel the lust that seemed in our loins. As she was holding me, my own need was rising to a peak, I knew there was little I could do about it, I didn't care when she started to undress: all I wanted was to get her naked and take her in my arms and feel her body as I wanted her body.</p> <p>Once she was removed she began slowly to undress me, each move I made brought her closer. I didn't take my eyes off her as I watched her body move as she undid my shirt. The buttons slipped from my shoulders and I could see the lace of her bra. I watched her eyes as she slid it off her shoulders and then tossed it carelessly to the side of the lounge.</p> <p>I stood up, she took me in her arms and we kissed again slowly kissing each other. Her breasts, my chest, all the while she had one of the largest nipples that I had ever felt.</p> <p>My hands were moving all over her back, and as I moved my head from side to side her skin moved as mine moved across hers, I was lost in the heat and the softness of her. I could feel her arousal as she stood on tiptoes, I knew if I ran my fingers over her spine I caused her to have a very erotic orgasm.</p> <p>She broke the kiss, she pulled me up to her and we kissed again in a way that was so soft and slow that it brought me to tears. It seemed like an eternity, but I knew she didn't want me to go, she took her hand away and told me to lie back down.</p> <p>She kissed me lightly on my lips and then on down my neck and chest, she did not seem to want to go any further. She lay herself over me, kissing my throat then slowly moving down over my stomach and across the top of my penis. Her hand moved to my groin and began to massage me, I could feel the warmth of her hand across my skin.</p> <p>With a final kiss I felt the cool air from her breath moving down over me, when she was close to my cock head. She used her free hand to massage my balls and slowly lowered herself so that her mouth was above me. I could feel the heat of her and could smell her as her body moved against me. I could feel her breasts touching me as she lowered herself to the top of her head and I could feel her breasts against mine, her nipples becoming hard as she slid down.</p> <p>Her legs parted as I felt her warmth spread across my cock, and all I could see were the beautiful folds of her pussy. I could feel her lips open as she lowered herself, her breath now hitting me directly, I could feel the heat of her passion as she brought herself closer, I could feel the urgency in her as she slid down to the base of my cock. Each inch she took I was amazed that she could take me that far.</p> <p>Slowly she took me into her mouth, she slowly worked me in, taking me in as if she were taking a horse into a field. Her body moved with hers as she raised herself and she came off me.</p> <p>Still holding it, she moved her body so that it was between me and her mouth. Her lips touched mine, I could feel her breath as she pressed me closer. She kissed her way down my body, licking the lines where her pussy met my skin, my testicles, my thighs and my shaft as her mouth moved to my balls. Her mouth surrounded my penis as she slowly slid down me, she would take the head of me inside her mouth, suck it, and rub it back and forth with her tongue or her hand.</p> <p>She brought her head back up again taking her hands off my thighs and her body came up to mine, she moved her hips into me.</p> <p>With my hands she pulled me to her and kissed me all over my face, my lips her mouth, her tongue and my neckâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
