She moaned softly, looking at him, wondering if he saw. His fingers pulled one side of her panties free and he started to flick over her hardening clit. She was moaning softly now, but he knew exactly how to do it. He slipped two fingers into her sex, feeling a little resistance. He knew it was not right, but still. He wanted to touch just how he wanted. He had to know where she had gotten the courage, and would he be able to do this? No matter how hard he tried.</p> <p>But she didn't stop him, so he kept feeling her softness and she closed her eyes and moaned. That felt nice, he thought to himself. But then he realized that they wanted to be together, so he pulled her down on top of him and laid her down. While laying down, he pulled all his clothing off, and she lifted her legs and wrapped them around his waist. He wanted to slide in, but he really didn't want to hurt her. So he lay on top of her, his cock between her legs.</p> <p>He felt her wetness and began rocking against him, not wanting to hurt her. This was the closest he had ever been to cheating. But he never knew. His cock was sliding easily into her and he was so close to cumming. He felt that moment, her wet hot heat around his cock. It was so good, he thought. He rolled to the side and pulled her to him. He kissed her, the feel of her mouth, her lips, her tongue. Then, he reached down and began playing with what he could of her taut nipples. But he had no condom since he had no idea that was what they had been getting. He wanted to let her know when he had gotten it, but didn't have the chance to. He was breathing hard, watching her.</p> <p>She lifted her head and looked at him.</p> <p>"I'm not ready to be with you yet." She began smiling, which he never could.</p> <p>"What am I getting ready to get ready to do?" He was not even thinking or trying to do, but he had to figure out what it meant. She reached up and pulled her skirt down slowly to reveal her pussy, which was swollen and wet, glistening.</p> <p>"Oh this is what I've been looking for." She said slowly, "it isn't here. It is somewhere else."</p> <p>He could see her, see the pinkness of her glistening sex. He felt like a kid. He was in shock, wanting to do something. He wanted to take her, he had wanted to do this so many times. And yet, this was just like this. He had no choice. But he knew this was wrong, so he held it. So he pulled her to him. He kissed her, "It's not here."</p> <p>So they lay there, not talking. He was unsure of what to say or do. Everything had already been going so well. He knew that they had not been fooling around, but that had been years ago. All they did was make love, and have some fun. He pulled back and looked down at her, and saw the look of pleasure on her face. He put his hand over her. She opened her eyes. He had stopped kissing, but was still gently pressing her leg apart. "Don't you want to do this?" She reached up with her other hand and stroked his cheek.</p> <p>He didn't answer. He felt his cock harden slightly even though she had just touched him. It wouldn't happen, he thought. So he was just going to tease and make her cum. She seemed to like his teasing.</p> <p>"Let's put this on, please." She held his hands up.
