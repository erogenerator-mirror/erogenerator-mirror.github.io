Let's get dressed and go."</p> <p>"We need to get going, I can't wait to see your house," I said, thinking to myself. I knew that it wouldn't be too long before they would be arriving.</p> <p>After we dressed and took our car in and the door closed, we went into her house and put our things away.</p> <p>We went upstairs and I grabbed my bag and then she asked me to stay with her for a while. I went into the bathroom and took off my clothes and looked at my body admiringly. I was a very thin 6'2" but my body was muscular, shapely, my hair was a light golden blonde and my skin was the color of chocolate.</p> <p>I put on a tight fitting shirt and then a pair of jeans, I was not wearing a bra and I slid a thick black sweater over my head. I was just starting to get into them when a door opened, we both spun around to see three people in a large manor, two women wearing the same uniform, the younger woman, was a black woman and the older woman was a white man who looked to be the manager.</p> <p>"Ah," one of the men said, "I am Jack."</p> <p>"Jack," the woman said, "we are from the city of Atlanta, we love our job and we don't want to leave without one.</p> <p>"It is hard going," the man, who seemed to want to be more distinguished, said, "but we do need help with your groceries and that is what we'll get you for Christmas."</p> <p>"I have been shopping there now, my family are good too."</p> <p>"I saw you at the mall today.</p> <p>"Yes, but I was with the customer and he's all right," the girl laughed, "we just can't have you staying out late," she replied with a smile,</p> <p>"Thank you. This is my first time and you're a little strange," the other woman said and I guess it was her first time too as it was her husband that greeted her from the other side of the door.</p> <p>"I thought we might go for dinner," said the man with a smile and then a very serious look, "My name is Jack," I said indicating me as a prospective customer.</p> <p>"The lady is Eve," said Jack, "the lady will be with you in a moment." He pulled a chair down beside me and I sat down on the bench just as Eve came walking towards me.</p> <p>"It's lovely seeing you," she said. I had to laugh when I first looked at her. I saw that she was wearing a pale blue sweater and brown slacks.</p> <p>"I am so happy to meet you," said Eve while looking into my eyes.</p> <p>"I am the luckiest man in the world to meet you," I said.</p> <p>"You have a good mind, we like to eat and drink with you here."</p> <p>"Please tell me that if we would like to stay in and continue our conversation," I started, "I'm kind of broke now, but I can try again."</p> <p>"You have to agree with me," she said, "I'm not a complete idiot."</p> <p>"I'm not sure I agree with you," I said.</p> <p>"Don't tell me," she said, "I'm very interested in looking at you."</p> <p>"What would you be looking at?" I asked.</p> <p>"Your body," she giggled. "Why don't you sit down on the stool beside me," she said and then leaned forward and asked, "Do you come from the city?"</p> <p>"Actually from the city," I answered.</p> <p>"Where do you live?" she asked.</p> <p>"New York City."</p> <p>"You are a new man," she said, "How long are you taking?"</p> <p>"We have had some trouble starting our relationship," I said.</p> <p>"You can stay here though," she smiled, "I'm a good cook too."</p> <p>"You can cook too, Eve," I said.</p> <p>She kissed me on the cheek.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I said as we left the men's room.</p> <p>"It's okay," she said, "and I thought it might be fun to share my home with you."</p> <p>"It is a nice home," I answered and then turned to my man.</p> <p>"I will be back in a moment," I said.
