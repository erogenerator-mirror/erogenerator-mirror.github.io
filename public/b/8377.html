She looked up at him now, her eyes meeting his, and smiled at him as her right hand drifted down to his crotch, and started stroking him through his pants. He grinned and leaned back, letting his body slide over hers. “Mmmm, this is nice.”</p> <p>"Might as well join the party.” He leaned down to kiss her again while his right hand reached across and undid the straps of her bra. They separated a little as her breasts spilled out from her bra and he reached down to gently cup her mounds. She raised her arms as he did, and pulled his shirt off, and reached for the button of her pants, undoing it and slipping it off next. He reached around and slid his hands up her legs, reaching her hips and pulling her pants off as she lifted her hips. He pulled her back to his chest and kissed her belly, then her thighs, while his hands slid up her thighs to the waist of her panties. He could feel her heat beneath his fingers as the silky material slid off and he slid his hands under them, lifting them off as she kicked them away. He slid his hands up her thighs, and slid them to her warm, wet crotch.</p> <p>They smiled at each other for very long moments. Neither of them had anything to talk about, so they just gave each other little kisses. When he was almost down to the waist line of her panties, he ran his hands back up her thighs now, brushing her bare belly. When he reached up to gently roll her right nipple between his fingertips, she leaned forward, arching her back and taking his hand with her, letting him lower the panties, revealing a triangle of fine fuzz. He raised himself and slid his fingers up and down between her lips, feeling her heat as he brushed over her clit.</p> <p>She leaned back, and he leaned against her, letting his fingers roam to her pussy, and lower to her ass. He slid a finger inside her, and she pushed back against him. She moaned into his mouth, and he lifted his head slowly so he could watch her, and realized at once she was really wet. She pushed down harder, and moaned into his mouth, eyes now wide, watching his fingers slide in and out of her as she tried to keep both of her hands on the back of his head. She lifted them gently off his shoulders. He sat back and smiled. “Did you have fun tonight?"</p> <p>Giggles and kisses. "I didn't get to finish my dessert just yet.”</p> <p>“I enjoyed it.”</p> <p>“You made me feel special.”</p> <p>"And you made me feel sexy too.”</p> <p>They both chuckled. "It’s just that it’s been such a long time since I’ve had a dessert that tastes good.”</p> <p>She grinned again. “I can’t tell, though. Not to anyone. You just have to pick something up every day.”</p> <p>She laughed. “I can always tell. I like to pick something up every day.”</p> <p>"I think we’ll like to pick something up for breakfast.”</p> <p>She leaned forward and kissed him deeply, letting her tongue slide and press up against his mouth, and began pushing herself back against him again. She slid her hands over his shoulders and back, and kissed him again as she sat on the edge of the bed with her legs splayed wide and pulled his cock slowly into her. He groaned under her kiss, and started moving over her. She reached up, and took his right hand, lifting her chin up as he leaned back so he could watch his dick slide back and forth over her. “This is for you.” She kissed him again, letting him feel her warmth and wetness, running her hands up and down the inside of his arms and chest, and let them drop a third time before pulling them to her face and kissing him, sucking on his tongue hungrily as he moved his hands back to her breasts.</p> <p>He reached behind her, feeling her skin, and grabbed both breasts, enjoying how heavy they were, and then rolled her nipples between his thumbs and index fingers. She let out a small moan and a shudder and leaned back to give him better access. With one hand he started kneading her breast in his fingers, letting the other hand slip down a little, and slide over her leg to his balls. She let her legs drop apart, and gave him room to slide his hand lower once again. She was very wet, and her thighs had parted slightly, so he slid his middle finger inside her as far as—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
