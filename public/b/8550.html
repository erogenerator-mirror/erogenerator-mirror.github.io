"Oh, my. My. God! Are you kidding me? That's not what I meant!" I looked at her eyes as she stood there stunned. As soon as I saw her, I leaned in against her and kissed her. Her arms were around my neck as she hung on to me tightly. I opened my mouth to taste her lips, but stopped as I felt my lip being bitten by the point of my teeth.</p> <p>As our kiss broke, I looked into her eyes and said, "I'm sorry," as we looked into each other's eyes and giggled like we had been dozing together all day. "Do you want to get together tomorrow?"</p> <p>She didn't answer, only smiled and leaned over her pillow. "I'll get there as soon as I get back from work," she replied. "Do you really, really, really want to come back?"</p> <p>The words "if you really, really really want to" just popped into my head with every phrase I'd ever heard, but it never felt that sexy. I felt like if I didn't stop right now, it would never go away. I didn't. It was just too good to be over quickly. If she saw me with her arms around me every time we kissed, she would probably move around in there to find us together.</p> <p>I was so happy all day that I couldn't wait to see her. Then, when she finally came out of her shower and found me standing there just as she had when I came in the room, I felt my heart going faster.</p> <p>I couldn't wait either. I couldn't wait for her to say yes to coming out. I couldn't wait for her to come home.</p> <p>As I watched her climb from the shower, that image I had when she was my first lover, filled my mind. She just came out of that shower all wrapped up, soaking wet and smiling as she came over to me.</p> <p>Her body shook all over as she bent over with her arms against the frame of the door. It was as if she had just found a new lover. She smiled to me and started rubbing her body all over mine as she grabbed the edge of the towel and said, "Let's go! Maybe after I shower, I'll tell you all about it!"</p> <p>We dressed as quickly as she slipped the robe on. Then, we quickly moved into my room and took the first shower together. The water felt great on both our bodies as we rubbed soap over one another. It felt good to be clean as well. As we were drying each other, we were very casual about being naked. We hadn't even got the bedroom door closed before we were all on the bed, and we were kissing and moaning all over each others pussies.</p> <p>I think part of the thought going through my head was "where to take this with" when she finally got to my pussy. "Get over here and give me that sweet mouth of yours," she said as she pushed me down onto the bed and started licking and sucking my clit while she fingered me, "I think you missed out on something great this time."</p> <p>I don't really remember, but I remember everything that happened from the moment our shower began. But, that's all it took. Within minutes, I was cumming and moaning and begging for more. My orgasm started deep in my stomach, and it lasted for about 10 seconds before she pulled away and I just laid there.</p> <p>As we both lay there soaking and giggling, we looked at one another and we came up with a plan on how we might fulfill one of our fantasy to come true. That plan, if we could be completely compatible, would make our sex even better.</p> <p>Chapter 5- "Ride Me."</p> <p>Ride Me</p> <p>"God, I'm gonna cum just thinking about it," I thought to myself, "and maybe even better than last night.</p> <p>"I'll bet, if that's what it feels like to you," she said, moving my hand from my pussy and giving it to me. "That's the way I want this to feel."</p> <p>I pulled up my knees, and spread my thighs wide. "That's okay," she said, "if I'm right, then you'll love every second of this, right?"</p> <p>"Yes," I said, a little too quickly, "I'd love it."</p> <p>She smiled, looked up at me, raised her eyebrows, and took her hand off my pussy, bringing it to my lips. I was a little afraid that I might start leaking, but it was better that way. She smiled at me and said, "Don't worry. You'll love it!"</p> <p>I just smiled back at her and pulled her closer.
