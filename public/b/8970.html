They were already done. I turned and walked to the living room and sat on the couch.</p> <p>Mitch had taken his clothes off and sat on the edge of the couch and reached out with his hands and touched my bare thighs. "Hmmm, you're so smooth." He said. I nodded. I looked over and he was still rubbing my soft legs.</p> <p>"You really look really sexy in this summer dress." My husband noticed me looking.</p> <p>"I am more than ready for bed tonight. This summer isn't over," I said and he moved his hand to my shoulder and turned me around and kissed me again. Our tongues danced inside one another's mouths.</p> <p>"Let's keep those clothes that you've made me wear off." He said. He slid his hands along my sides to my hips, and he pulled me towards him and his hands cupped my breasts through the top of the tight dress.</p> <p>"If you want me to wait you're going to wear this dress and it's only for me." He said as he slid his hands over the top. I felt one hand caress my breast through the thin fabric. "And let's go to our bedroom. I want to make love to you so hard."</p> <p>He stepped towards me as I stood. He pulled me closer to the door, which made me feel very vulnerable in his arms. I walked towards the stairs, which led to my husband's bedroom, the one that I made passionate love to the first time he'd taken me.</p> <p>"Let's take things to bed." He growled between his teeth. "You and I both know that we can't go out without each another naked." I nodded and I took his hand and we got into his bedroom. The only sounds in the silence were the thumping heartbeat of his heart and the squeaking of my bedside table.</p> <p>He pulled me back against him, our bodies crushing together as he lowered us on the bed. Our mouths came forward almost touching, as the passion in our kisses grew intense. His hand took one of my feet and began massaging them. "I want you." "Me too." I said as he wrapped his fingers around my ankle, pulled me closer and as our lips met and our tongues danced we were lost in ecstasy. As our mouths moved closer his arms wrapped their selves around me and my arms wrapped around his neck. It was the first time we'd been completely free, naked without a stitch on. I didn't feel at all ashamed of what we were doing.</p> <p>"You're beautiful, you know that?" I said as his hands ran up my legs and stroked my bare legs. His hands slid to my cheeks and he kissed me again as he started rubbing my pussy through my night dress. "I want you so badly." "I want you too." I said as I pulled his mouth from mine and kissed him and I ran my tongue deep into his mouth at the same time my hand was in his pants. I felt the warmth of his body on mine, his hardness throbbing against my belly from excitement.</p> <p>We broke our kiss, breathing heavily. "Let's take a shower together," I said, pulling back with a smirk. We stripped the nightdress off without a sound, and as I did, he stood behind me. I loved seeing him naked for the first time and I felt my skin on fire. His body felt so smooth and wonderful as he slid his hands up to cup my breasts and to feel the hardness beneath my body. I felt it against his thigh and against my stomach as he held me against his body.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I said as we both looked down at his cock. I loved the size of it, the hardness in my palm on his thigh and at my skin on mine.</p> <p>"Yes." He said confidently. "I want to feel all of you, all of you." I reached and started to unfasten his belt. "Come on, I want everything."</p> <p>I was half way down his body now, stroking his throbbing hardness as it stood proudly at 6" when I stopped and got down on my knees. I leaned forward towards him and slowly kissed his erection from tip to base, my tongue licking slowly at his head as my hand started to make long strokes along its full length with each stroke going toward the base. Soon, the whole length of his shaft was covered with my saliva as my mouth slipped down the side to take in his length completely. He was so hard that his shaft was dripping with my spit and it hit the end of his shaft with a soft plopping sound as I slowly slid it forward. I kept my tongue out of my mouth just long enough to say and do.</p> <p>"Fuck me."
