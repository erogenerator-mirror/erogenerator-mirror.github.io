Just as was my habit, I had been going to her classes in the library all the time. It was hard to just stand there and study for an hour, while doing a few things in the library, and still not get myself off.</p> <p>The professor came along. He was a handsome man in his forties and a little older, but who you'd give your eye out for. When he sat across the desk from me, I thought I found him attractive. He was very tall for his age and well-muscled. His hair was brown and he had a very nice mustache and mustache and beard for a man. He had gray on his face and on his clothes.</p> <p>"Mr. Brown," I spoke as I sat.</p> <p>I looked up at my favorite professor. He nodded at me. The chair his desk sat right in front of him. He crossed his legs at the knee and I noticed his hand absentmindedly moving his legs to and fro. He was looking at me with lust-filled eyes as he did my books for the next few minutes. I was beginning to get a hard-on at the thought of him in the library. A couple of times during the day he looked at me like that and then returned his eyes back to their study of the text I was studying. I looked down at books and started to feel self-conscious.</p> <p>"Mr. Brown," he said as he stood again and walked around the desk to where I was sitting and sat back down at his desk.</p> <p>"I'm glad it's finally over, Michael," he said as he turned his head towards me. "That's probably what I need right about now," he told me.</p> <p>"That's good. That's not why I came here," I said.</p> <p>"Well, we'll just let it slide and say you just finished your last class."</p> <p>He turned his chair towards me and I saw that one of his hands was up and he was slowly pulling himself out of his pants. His pants were tight on him and his cock was hard from the blood pumping it through. He was really turning me on and I felt all the blood pulsing in my ears as much as my head. He slowly raised his head up and I was staring at another beautiful man, looking at me while fully dressed. He was very sexy and I wanted him so badly.</p> <p>"Um, sure, do you mind if I take off my pants, Michael?" he asked me.</p> <p>"Of course not," I answered.</p> <p>As soon as he stood I got up and quickly undid my pants. He helped me as I moved. I took my pants off and sat back down facing him. As I did so, my back stood up and I could feel my cock hardening in the chair. He sat across the desk and I placed my pants at my ankles and started to move them up.</p> <p>"Mr. Brown, I can't take any more," I said to him quickly as I sat and sat and sat. "I really need a break."</p> <p>"Why don't you come with me, Michael," he said politely.</p> <p>I sat and sat and watched him as he walked toward the door and then toward me. I had never seen a man leave his clothes off in the open room before. He stood before me in his grey pants and blue shirt as he led me out of the room. In spite of the fact that I had just been doing my homework, I had gotten hard just watching them. His body was hard and muscular and his cock was hard and rigid, hanging half way down to his leg and bouncing. I could smell the alcohol on him and it was a heady headiness.</p> <p>"Do you like it?" he asked in the same easy manner as before.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," I answered.</p> <p>I heard him walk toward me and he stood in front of me again.</p> <p>"Do you remember the first time we met?" he asked.</p> <p>I nodded my head up and down slowly.</p> <p>"Remember this," he said and leaned over and kissed me.</p> <p>I felt his hand cup the back of my neck firmly. I felt his lips touching my cheek as our tongues flicked and dueled with each other. His hands roamed my body all over and in no time at all I was getting turned on and very excited. I started to unbutton his shirt and it came off quickly as his hands quickly went between my legs again. They were rubbing my balls and my cock was stiffening fast. When he slipped his hands under my shorts and pulled them off my legs, they were too far along and I felt my cock rising toward the air.</p> <p>His mouth replaced his hands andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
