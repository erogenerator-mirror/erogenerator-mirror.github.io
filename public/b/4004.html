She thought maybe she had been a good person and that they would have a long and mutually successful marriage if it hadn't been for her inability to understand how they had come to be here and what had happened. She didn't know. It was a strange sort of freedom and her mind was running like a mile a minute, trying to come to grips with the reality of where she was and what she was doing in this unfamiliar country.</p> <p>The woman's long finger stroked the woman's face, her pale skin flushed with pleasure, her eyes opening as if in amazement, and she felt a wave of emotion rush through her as she gazed into the girl's hazel eyes. There was no need for further conversation. Her lips formed an O-shaped "O". Her eyes were still closed as she concentrated on her finger tips, slowly moving round and round her face, exploring the softness of her mouth and her lips, before she lowered her head and kissed the woman fully on the lips briefly, her tongue pushing into the woman's mouth searching. Their mouths were wet as they came to a kiss, and the woman moaned against the kiss, the woman's hand still gripping the girl's shoulder and the girl's tongue thrusting into her mouth again and again.</p> <p>Slowly the woman moved her hand from the girl's shoulder, to her neck, the girl's body tensing with excitement as her heart beat faster as she took in the scent of the woman's arousal. The woman's breasts were soft and firm, with dark pink nipples aching to be kissed, and although the woman was a beautiful woman, she was still a strange looking creature to the girl, and she wondered if this woman, while not perfect for life as she had had been, had any idea that she would want this woman more physically then a stranger. Maybe she should ask the girl.</p> <p>The girl slid her hand between the woman's thighs, the flesh on her fingers warm and smooth and it was difficult to take her hand away as she touched the woman's vulva, her fingers gently running down the folds of her labia, her finger sliding along the softness between the puffy labia, feeling her own moistness. The woman sighed as she felt her finger pressing into the moist flesh of the woman's pussy again and again, it was clear that this woman wanted her to explore the woman more, although this was just a game.</p> <p>The girl's finger tip slid past the outer lips of the woman's pussy, pushing slightly and opening her flesh more, and then it slipped deeper, its tip pushing against her, pushing against her inner lips and sliding into her wetness. She slid her hand back up the girl's smooth legs to cup her breast and squeeze it hard, feeling her nipple push into the palm of her hand and she knew that she was wet enough to penetrate the woman, so she did just that. She felt the woman's hand press harder against her breast, and she slid her finger deeper into the girl's pussy, her palm feeling up her clit, and it felt so good, not just exciting, it was a whole new kind of excitement and she was wetter than she had ever known her body to be. The girl felt the woman's finger thrust into her, pressing the swollen bud, the fingers of the woman's other hand pressing against the lips, and she started to move them in and out, gently at first, then with more aggression, sliding them deeper into the wetness that enveloped them in a wet velvet glove. This woman was in her own world of lust, and in her own body and she felt something inside her body start to move as she slipped her hand further into the woman's body, deeper into the moist flesh. She moved a second finger into the woman's pussy, stroking it around the lips and then slipping it into the depths of the woman's body, feeling the girl's body respond in the heat of her hands as she explored her own body in total surrender of the surrender that she felt as her finger slid inside her.</p> <p>The woman slid her fingers out of the girl's pussy, feeling how the woman's fingers were still pressing against her inner lips, their wetness slick against her hand and sliding towards her own pussy. The hands slid further from the woman, and her fingers slid further into the wet flesh of the girl's pussy, feeling her softness, and exploring into her most private crease, the centre of her sexuality, the centre where the woman's fingers would probe inside her body. Her fingers touched the flesh of the girl's inner lips and slid their way up, pressing against her clitoris. She could feel how her pubic hair would be slightly matted and sticky with the girl's juices, and the girl's cunt lips would give way to her fingersâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
