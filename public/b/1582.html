"I might get a ride home when it's time to put on the suit," Mary said in a husky voice.</p> <p>"I guess we could try and put out," I said.</p> <p>"I'm sure that would be quite easy," She said and gave me a naughty grin.</p> <p>She came back with a couple of bags and asked if she could use the ladies room while I was there. I smiled as I followed her.</p> <p>"This way..." She said and pulled the door shut as we neared the restroom.</p> <p>We were both laughing as we walked by the sinks. She turned the sink and handed me a handful of paper towels.</p> <p>"Sorry about that earlier. You just seemed distracted." We were both laughing, and she made that sexy little giggle again.</p> <p>We hurried to the linen closet where we washed ourselves and put away the things we might use later.</p> <p>"Do you think you could do a little more make-up before you leave?" I asked her after we'd taken a short break.</p> <p>"Sure, that would be great. I think we could do some of what we're doing right here."</p> <p>"No, Mary, this is about what we're going to do." I held her hand and we walked to the mirror, she'd already applied a thick coat with blush on the sides and I loved how it looked. Just the touch of her soft fingers made me forget about everything else in the world at that moment.</p> <p>"I think I'm ready. I'll go and get changed, and we'll meet back here."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I took her hand. I didn't want to let them go at that moment, even if the idea of doing anything with them for real seemed crazy. For me, a few minutes alone with Mary was all I needed to put things off my mind. I couldn't wait.</p> <p>"Are you okay with this?" I asked and she nodded.</p> <p>"Yes, I think it'll be fine. We know how we are now, and we're all here together. It's perfect."</p> <p>"I'll never forget it." I smiled and she hugged me.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, honey, I can't take our relationship for too long."</p> <p>"Of course not. I just don't want to ruin it for you. I just love you."</p> <p>"It won't ruin the relationship, but I wish that my boyfriend would feel that way about me in a real way. I miss you so much."</p> <p>"You know you love me too."</p> <p>We kissed and walked out. As we walked to her car, I held her tight and told her how much I loved her. I kissed her lightly on the forehead.</p> <p>"We might never get to see how you see it, but I love spending the night together with you, I will always love you."</p> <p>"Can I ask you something?" I asked.</p> <p>"Anything."</p> <p>"Is there something you would like to do tonight?"</p> <p>"Yes. Do you just want to do anything right now?"</p> <p>"We've been together as long as we can remember. I promise."</p> <p>"Okay. Anything we want."</p> <p>It was time to find out a little more about Mary, and things changed right there. When we arrived back at the house, we quickly changed out of our cloths and put on clean clothes. I still had my boxers on, so the only piece I had on was a pair of sandals that still had some of the same color as my skin.</p> <p>"I'm so nervous," Mary said.</p> <p>"Me too. I'm worried we may lose all of this together."</p> <p>"I'm not giving anything away tonight. I don't want us to loose everything."</p> <p>"Okay," I said and took her hand again.</p> <p>"Is there anything you'd like me to get us in trouble with in future?"</p> <p>"You know about something?"</p> <p>"Sure. Some things we've already talked about. I just wanted to know if you liked it before we went to that party in the parking garage."</p> <p>"I think that would be fine. It's okay to get a little scared at a first meeting."</p> <p>"Is that all?"</p> <p>"I might wantâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
