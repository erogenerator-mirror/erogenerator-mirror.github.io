His hand was moving wildly against his crotch. He began to speed up. She could feel herself responding to the stimulus as her sex continued to lubricate itself inside the fabric of his pants. She wanted more and more to feel him inside her. She was sure he was going to lose control when suddenly she felt him release himself. He groaned in pleasure when he saw her in the moonlight and felt his own climax coming with a heavy groan as he watched her.</p> <p>They both were looking in to each other's eyes as a powerful wave of pleasure passed through them. They lay there, breathing heavily, listening quietly to each other's gentle gasps.</p> <p>"I'm going to go to the bathroom," she told herself.</p> <p>******</p> <p>When she awoke at noon the next morning she found herself in the living room still naked. She had been standing at the window looking out to the harbor when the sounds of distant engines coming upstairs startled her. She quickly turned and walked back down the stairs as she started searching for her clothes she had left on her bed.</p> <p>In the restroom she removed the remaining buttons and found the same thing she had worn that morning and she found herself in her panties again. She felt the dampness as she reached between her legs and rubbed her sex gently. After brushing her hair she stood and quickly put on the panties, and tried to get the rest to her. The thought of walking back home naked still stuck in her brain and she quickly finished brushing her hair and makeup. She then picked up her clothes and headed downstairs.</p> <p>"I hope I didn't sleep okay," she lamented to herself.</p> <p>She found her friend on the couch watching a movie when a few minutes after they finished and she had set the movie in the DVD player.</p> <p>"You going to watch?" she quizzed before she could answer and realized the reason she was there.</p> <p>"Yeah, maybe a little later anyway," she said as she quickly changed the channel.</p> <p>"Okay, I'll join you later," he said as he walked by her.</p> <p>She heard him going back upstairs and turned back toward him as he disappeared before she could get up. She sat back down and saw that she still had the top two buttons of her tank top undone. She had already thrown on a pair of shorts.</p> <p>"Here, help yourself to your drink and it will take a lot of getting through," he said after handing her one.</p> <p>She had made a few trips to the liquor store yesterday to get herself a drink when she left with a couple of beers. When she had finished those, he handed the same one to her and went upstairs.</p> <p>She noticed two men outside the building, she followed and saw that they were walking toward her. In their heels, they were about six feet tall and were wearing a light colored suit.</p> <p>She was glad he couldn't see her because he was in plain sight.</p> <p>"Hello there," she greeted them with a smile.</p> <p>They both turned toward her and looked her closely up and down. He was in his dark blue suit with a gold belt, he had a red tie with his shirt rolled up. His hair was straight and his eyes were hard as he looked at her.</p> <p>He stood between her and the door and turned to look at her once again.</p> <p>"What was your name again?" he asked curiously.</p> <p>"Amy," she replied as she stepped closer to him and extended her hand once again.</p> <p>He looked up briefly and a smile came to his face before he looked back down, "What can I do for you?" he asked.</p> <p>"I came back for my book, I guess it's my turn to buy it," she said as she handed him the remote control.</p> <p>"Yeah, I know I'm not the type of guy to buy books but I am curious of you," he replied.</p> <p>He leaned next to her and pressed the button to turn the volume down on the movie they were watching. He watched as the movie played.</p> <p>"I'm glad this movie turns me on as well," he said as he leaned against the wall.</p> <p>"I know."</p> <p>He leaned closer and pressed the button again and this time the volume went to a level where he could tell she was aroused. He felt her shudder as he pressed the button once more. She sat back down again as he pressed the button one more time and she felt him lean in to kiss the back of her right shoulder and his fingers begin to massage her bottom.</p> <p>He kept his head pressed against her shoulder as she leaned to kiss him. She felt his left hand begin to slide up her bare back as he placed his lips around her neck. His tongue pushed forward and lightly caressed the skin which made her entire body tingle. His touch sent jolts of electricity throughout herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
