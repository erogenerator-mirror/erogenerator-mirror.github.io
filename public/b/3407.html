It was definitely the most passionate time we'd ever had. I don't ever think we broke a sweat. Every orgasm had taken our breath away. We had never been happier.</p> <p>He said, "We still have time tomorrow; I want to get back to what we've been doing."</p> <p>I gave him another long kiss before finally saying, "I love you Rob. Tomorrow is going to be awesome."</p> <p>After he kissed me for a couple minutes he slowly got up. "I gotta go, we're finished. I'm gonna need breakfast."</p> <p>"Come have breakfast with me."</p> <p>"Can I use your shower."</p> <p>"It's going to take a few minutes."</p> <p>I helped him get his robe completely off. I wrapped his robe around his waist and held it up. It was hard to believe I could still feel the excitement between us. Rob was going to take what he'd told me to give me. It was all I could do not to rip his pants off and fuck him right then and there. It didn't matter at all how slow he was, I would get him back there and I'd take him back.</p> <p>As soon as he turned to leave I grabbed his arm and pulled his body close to mine. He looked at me briefly before he turned around. There was something in his eyes that told me I need a lot more then just his arms around me. When he gave me that deep love look I knew he couldn't wait until then. He wanted a chance to hold my body against his every now and then. I looked at the clock on the wall and asked, "Want to stop?"</p> <p>"I've got time."</p> <p>"OK, I'll see you tomorrow then."</p> <p>"I can't let you stop me."</p> <p>"No, I'll take a little extra time. If we're not back any later then that's fine as long as we aren't caught in bed." I wrapped my arms around his body and kissed him before I walked out of his room.</p> <p>When I got to my car I decided I didn't want to leave. It wasn't that it wasn't going to happen but I wasn't sure if there were things that wanted to happen while I went there. There were others that would have been happy to go too. There was that girl that I fell in love with that had a wild side, something that I had never even thought about yet. Maybe this could be one of those times. The more I think about it the more I want to find out. I parked my car and walked up to my front door. I rang the bell to see who was at the door.</p> <p>"Go make your brother's room a little nicer."</p> <p>He smiled and kissed me. "I'm ready when you are. He'll be ready about an hour later."</p> <p>"That's great." I kissed him again as we walked to the door. I put my keys back in my pocket and looked the door key. It had been a long time since I left the building in the same clothes my brother always got as he went. Even though he had left it in the living room with the door open to the hallway.</p> <p>Sitting on his sofa he said, "I've missed this place."</p> <p>"You know, it's only fair that you should be able to spend the rest of your life here."</p> <p>"Yeah. I think we make the best house on the block; it's been there ever since the other day."</p> <p>"I hope we can talk about this later tonight. If you want to bring it up again, I'm available." He stood up and pulled me into his arms. I looked out the window; it had almost been two long years since we had spent any real time together.</p> <p>As he picked me up and carried me to his room he said, "I'm all set. I want to take you out to dinner tomorrow night and then back to the hotel room and make love."</p> <p>"That sounds like a plan to me."</p> <p>We walked to his truck so I could get in first. When I got in he shut the door and locked. The lights in our car came on and we were gone in a second. I felt excited and nervous but I didn't want to get in the same car with him so soon. We got the car started without a word. I watched the windows as he drove until he turned his headlights on full force. Once in a while he would put his arm around me and kiss me. He would have given me a hand up until he got behind the wheel. When the door began to open he drove back to the freeway and the parking garage.</p> <p>When he entered the garage he had a garage door going and he pulled it all the way open. I couldn't believe I wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
