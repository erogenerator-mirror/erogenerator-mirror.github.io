It took a minute before he was completely inside. He stopped, then, and I said, "Hold still for a moment, baby."</p> <p>"What is there, darling?"</p> <p>I took his cock in hand, held it there, and looked up at him.</p> <p>"Oh, I love it. That's so nice. I love you so much!"</p> <p>I could feel his cock twitch, hear his sighing, and he began stroking. His grip firm on her ass, he began to push, pressing himself further and further inward, feeling the muscles inside moving against him while there were no words. The head of his cock was nudging the entrance to her womb, and I heard her gasp, and his cock began to push inward. As it slid into her, her legs moved against his sides so that her ass was pressed in even harder against his pelvis.</p> <p>He continued holding her cheeks, and the angle made it hard to thrust inside her. I watched her legs move as he moved, and, knowing Dani had no choice but to yield, I could feel the movement of his pelvis each movement to hers. I looked up, into his eyes, and saw pure love.</p> <p>"Dani, I love you."</p> <p>"Hush, my love. Hold still."</p> <p>He slid slowly all the way in.</p> <p>"Oh God," she gasped.</p> <p>Dani's legs went around his waist, and I watched her pussy lips part and pull outward as his cock sank ever deeper, its whole column inside her. I felt Dani's body tense as she felt his pubic bone touch hers, his arms going around her as he pulled her back down, as his cock began to grow harder inside her. I had a vision of his cock, rising before her, then retreating slightly as she felt it slip, then coming back to rest inside her, and his balls were slapping against her ass with each stroke, as his cock, inch by inch, slid in and out. He moaned and grunted with his own movements, in spite of her protestations about being too tight, and she began pulling herself back against him with each stroke.</p> <p>Their bodies began to move faster and faster as they both approached orgasm. When I told her to hold still, Dani was nearly there, and my hand, as we watched her pussy get wetter and hotter, started to move with him. Her feet pulled down, and she began to move her legs so that they matched his movements, and her hands held him in place.</p> <p>"Oh, love, I'm so close! I'm going to cum!" she gasped between gasps for breath.</p> <p>"I'm ready to cum."</p> <p>She gasped in between breaths of breath and gasped out a long "yes, lover."</p> <p>Dani was quivering, trembling, trembling as my hand continued to work her pussy. I moved back away from him, and lifted her onto her feet. He had her spread eagle, legs spread wide, ass up in the air. His rigid cock was pointed at the entrance of her pussy, and she was trembling with desire from the effort of being held so tightly pressed against his shaft. His cock was throbbing, his breath coming in short gasps as his cock jerked and throbbed inside her, and he held himself still there for a long time as he watched as her eyes opened, watching, feeling herself on it as she cried out for more.</p> <p>"Love, I love you."</p> <p>His hand moved up to squeeze her breast and her ass lifted in the air. My palm reached up, found her clit, and began to massage it. Her body was rigid as her head fell back, and I felt the wave of her orgasm build.</p> <p>"Oh yes, my darling, I never knew I could be this beautiful and you're so beautiful!" She cried out as she felt her climax build, moving against him as his hands stroked her thighs as his cock continued to thrust upward in and out inside her pussy.</p> <p>"I love you so much," he whispered as her body suddenly shook under him as she came.</p> <p>His body jerked as he started to cum, his voice a strangled whisper as he released his seed within her. He slid half of her body with his, and held himself over her as she opened her eyes.</p> <p>We had both been crying, and she had pulled away from me. It had seemed like forever, she thought finally, as the tension left her. But he hadn't moved, and she turned toward him, and they kissedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
