I needed to get to know you, and I know you would hate me for it. For tonight, I'd like you to try for my friend."</p> <p>"Well it seems to work out for me."</p> <p>"I wish I could tell you what was going on with Sam as well."</p> <p>I said, "Well, he was having an affair. He's really a nice guy, but... I'm not sure if he's telling my wife, and I'm just not sure about... you know?"</p> <p>"I've known Sam for years and he's good to me."</p> <p>"Yeah, well I know what I'd better do. I've got your phone number."</p> <p>While I was searching out Sam's address, I was getting excited, but this was too exciting to stop. I called her on the phone and told her to go ahead. There was a pause on the other end, and she said, "Is this it?" then she laughed and said she needed to go. I took my phone and hit the record button and said, "I'm sorry, but she's a friend now. It won't change anything, so you should call her. I have to call you back."</p> <p>After a pause while I waited, I said, "Okay, I'm at her house. Call her."</p> <p>"Okay, bye."</p> <p>I waited with a strange look on my face for a couple of minutes. Then I said, "That's a lot better." I told Sam, who was sitting on the other end. She said, "I'd be glad to. I have just the right clothes in my closet. Can I please call you?"</p> <p>"If you could. Here's my cell number."</p> <p>Sam left her phone with me for a few minutes. I was getting frustrated, but I put my cellphone away and left the place. I knew I would be seeing Sam for a little while, but I was worried about how my wife would react, and I was beginning to get anxious.</p> <p>When I came of a house I had gotten lost in, I turned around to look for Sam. The street was dark, so if I looked at her I could see her. I had to hope she was enjoying the evening and I was very excited too. I knew I could be dangerous, but I couldn't help myself.</p> <p>A couple of minutes later I heard the phone ring in my ear followed by the sound of the doorbell. I walked to the front door and saw it was Sam. I said hello to her and walked through the house. I could see she was wearing a loose fitting blouse and it fit well over her breasts.</p> <p>We got close enough to talk for a while, but I could feel that her conversation with Sam was on a different level. We talked about the house we lived in and when I said Sam was a friend, I told her I had made a mistake.</p> <p>Sam said that she would really like to talk with me. As I talked to Sam I realized she had done it almost five years ago. She was like a younger version of my wife in her own way. I liked her just as much as I like Sam, and it was hard to think of her as my wife anymore. I guess I really liked Sam. I decided to tell her to go ahead and just go. I didn't feel obligated, but I did still feel the need to tell her and Sam might like it.</p> <p>After we broke the first of several attempts at getting friendly, we agreed we both needed to do it sooner rather than later. I told Sam if she didn't want this to be our little 'talk', to go on home right away. I then looked at all her papers and told her I needed them because I needed to leave for a little while.</p> <p>I was nervous. I knew that before I left, I would have to tell her to go over the plans of our relationship. I didn't want to leave Sam, and I wanted to feel safe with her. After I left I waited around the house for just a minute. When I walked by Sam's office I heard her saying, "This could be trouble, Jack. Would you be so kind as to take these papers? We can talk on the phone tomorrow if that would make you feel better?"</p> <p>She said, "That's fine, Jack. Maybe we can just go over them the next time I see you."</p> <p>I just said, "No. Please come with me. Take your time."</p> <p>I walked over to her and she took my hand and led me inside her house. We kissed goodbye and she walked me to my car to go home. Once I was in my car I told her if she wanted to take the next time, she really did.</p> <p>When my car pulled up into mine I said, "We needâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
