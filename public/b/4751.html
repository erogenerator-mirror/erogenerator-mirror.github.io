No one else is awake."</p> <p>In a daze I followed her to the elevators, the three of us stood behind her as the doors closed. We were alone. We felt so close to each other and I found I could not wait to be here with her. The feeling of her skin and hair between my hands just made me want to get between her legs and I had to have her right there.</p> <p>I was in heaven. I had never felt as excited as I did with her on the phone. The elevator made it's way up and we reached our floor. Her card was in the door catch as we walked into the room. We took off our clothes and she stood before me as I moved in front of her as we undressed. I dropped my boxers and I stepped out of them and lay on my back, pulling her with me. I was on my back as she moved over me, her wet vagina hovering above me. I felt her hands on my breasts, circling my nipples, then moving between. I pushed her breasts together, sucking on each one as she took them both at once, moaning softly.</p> <p>I reached up to touch my own, letting go of the breast it was holding, allowing it to slide over my palm as I caressed myself. I took a second to feel and see her, as I had done with her when we were on the phone.</p> <p>She was almost as long as my cock and almost two inches, even flaccid. I felt I had never felt this before. I could almost see my fingers on her as she lay back next to me. I lifted her legs until they came up over my shoulders and gently moved between her thighs, feeling the heat and moisture that now leaked from her.</p> <p>In a flash I was on my knees between her legs, looking at the perfection of the beauty she had brought to my life. The contrast between the heat of her pussy and my erection, which now pulsed in response and as it did I looked up right into her eyes as she smiled down at me. I lowered her legs again, taking her right arm and spreading her fingers wide. I lowered my mouth to her, kissing as I could between kisses, just lightly brushing her as I teased the tip of her finger with my tongue. She moved her hand between our two bodies to help guide me. I was completely rigid, as I was when I saw her. I was in heaven. I wanted to be at that perfect peak, so close to it. I could do this forever, but I had to be able to wait for her to come down, so I would be patient.</p> <p>I felt her hands on my head as she guided me until I could kiss her breast where the nipple had just pulled away from her body, before lowering my mouth again, teasing herself at every turn. I was on my back as her mouth moved to the other nipple and I felt her moving and moaning her pleasure into me. God it felt heavenly. I did not know what to do - I just held her while I gave myself up to the pleasure her body was giving me. I was on my side, side-to-side. My fingers moved over my skin, finding her and she was now moving with me, just like I was. Together we were joined in delight and it made me crazy to be with her.</p> <p>We both felt it, the tension of it, not just the feeling of it itself. We both felt it, but we knew to kiss. She held me as I kissed her, guiding my mouth over her breast, down her stomach to that waiting spot just below the waist, where she had waited, then she let go and I moved my hand lower until I could touch the top of her love box as it opened so slowly to me. I began to kiss and lick her there, feeling the wetness and the smell of her. She was so soft and the touch of my tongue and lips added to the sensation. It felt wonderful and wonderful and I was kissing her everywhere I could, everywhere I could.</p> <p>Then I felt her pushing herself down on me so that my head was not in the way as she rode me. I could feel her lips on my head as she slowly moved down over my face until I could feel the warmth of her on my skin. She sat still as I reached up and pressed against her gently, moving my hands around to hold her close, holding her so she seemed to have no space to move. I could feel her pussy as I pressed against her, I could feel her soft curls as she moved against my face and I could feel her breasts as she held on, the movement of our bodies synchronized with each downward movement of her body and I felt her begin to shudder and the tension of her body began to build over meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
