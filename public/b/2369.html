I was looking straight at the door and when I looked back into the room, there she was! It was my old college age teacher. He looked me up and down and then smiled, looking straight at me.</p> <p>I turned around to say something and he reached out and took my hand, shaking and saying "Come with me!"</p> <p>I was confused for a while. Where was he going with me here? He took me to a side room of a house where there was only one bed, a queen size one.</p> <p>"You've never lived in that house, have you?" He asked me.</p> <p>"N- no, I've been with several girls in the past." I answered as he laid me on the bed and then went back down to my bag.</p> <p>He took my things and took them into the bathroom and then came back out with the hot water. He had me get into the shower and then started to shampoo my hair. I thought he was going to kiss me but instead got me to soap myself and rub soap and shampoo around my body. When I was done, I was shocked when I realized he was massaging my breasts, running his fingers up and down my sides and finally down to my ass. I felt so good!</p> <p>He washed me off, washed my hair and then turned off the water and said "Here you are. Let's go back downstairs." He came out a minute later with the same box that had been on my bed.</p> <p>I opened it and found a couple of pairs of pants and my old ones. One of them was my robe and I quickly slipped it on.</p> <p>"You should change into my pants, they're too tight," I said as I pulled them on and looked at him. "What if I want your name?" There was no one I knew about in town so I was definitely more than familiar with his name.</p> <p>"No," he smiled at me. "My name is Frank and I was named after your grandma."</p> <p>It was an honor to him. "Okay, so you know the story, what else?"</p> <p>"Not the whole story," he said as he pulled me to him again. "The other story is about what happened to you at the pool," he said while kissing my cheek.</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"This is how you ended up working as a whore," he said as he led me to the sofa where he laid down with me on my back facing him. He moved down to my arms and kissed me on either side my head before sliding down a hand to my mound and rubbing his fingers through the pubic hair.</p> <p>I was shocked at what his magic fingers were doing. He had been working up and down my slit with one finger and then up and down as he was working my nipples with his other hand. He pulled his finger out of my slit and began to rub the head of his erection onto my opening. I thought I was going to burst and started to tell him, but his fingers just pushed hard into me and all I could do was gasp as he pushed my opening apart.</p> <p>He slid in just a bit and then pulled out almost all the way and then pushed back in very slowly. I had never felt anything like it before. The feeling of his hardness as he worked himself into me, pushed all my muscles up and I couldn't believe how good it felt. I had never felt anything like it in my life. I was almost disappointed when he pulled out all the way, but then I felt his fingers as he rubbed them over and around my clit and then I felt the most magnificent and wonderful sensation of an orgasm as the first wave of it went through me.</p> <p>"Let me in now," he said as he moved up between my legs. He pulled his cock out of my pussy and rubbed it over my lips a couple of times, making me want to touch it to make it go back in. It didn't stop there.</p> <p>"Wait," he said as he climbed over the top of me and lowered himself onto my face. He was going to suck me. It had been quite a while since I had been pleasured and he was doing everything he knew to take me over the edge again.</p> <p>I opened my lips and began to lick his hardness with my tongue. We were both coming down from our mutual explosions the longer I was licking him the harder it was. His hands holding my shoulders and his eyes looking down at me as he leaned down and then up to kiss me while he fucked me with his cock.
