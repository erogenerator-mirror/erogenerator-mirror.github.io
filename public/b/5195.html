She had been surprised but delighted when he called her "Bitch" at the end of the session. But she had found him to be charming. She had felt that all day that night and it had made her heart beat faster. She had actually liked it. It felt good to feel that much lustrous power. She loved hearing that voice, that rich rich accent and her heart went wild with desire. And then she went into the shower and felt his hard cock press against her. It had sent waves of pleasure through her. She had just stood there for a second, holding it and relishing it as it rubbed against her. God. He was bigger than her ex, the man that she was married to for all these years. And he had been right in her pants too. She could feel herself getting wet as he rubbed up against her.</p> <p>He let go of her hair. He didn't say a word. He just looked over his shoulder at her. She smiled at him and went to kiss him. She kissed him back, the passion between them unmistakable. He turned toward her and kissed him again long and deep, forcing himself on her. He didn't hold back in the way that she had. There was no stopping the pleasure that flowed through her. The feeling of his tongue exploring her mouth, dancing over her teeth and her tongue. A moment later the kiss had turned wild in intensity, the heat between them consuming her. She was still gripping the hard cock on her thigh. It had become a hard muscle that she could hold. She kissed him again and held his tongue with her own as he held her. Her mind was alive with passion. Her breath was coming in ragged gasps and she wanted something she never knew she wanted. It was all consuming. She felt it in the way he moved against her so suddenly, so deep, so suddenly. He pulled her against him, pushing her hands up to cradle her breasts. She wanted to feel it in her fingers. It was as though she didn't want to touch it but as if she had to feel it again. The fire that had been inside her for so long now began to run from her fingertips and her hands down her body to her crotch. She hadn't realized how wet she had become. She almost fainted with desire. She felt so alive that she could do anything. She broke the kiss with him and looked at him. She felt like she was in his body. He had been here too long. It was as though they existed. She took in what she saw in his eyes. It was as if something in her own mind knew what it wanted from her.</p> <p>She got on her knees and slid to the floor. He knelt behind her. She didn't move. She looked at him. His face looked as it had that morning she was so scared. She was scared out of her mind. She thought she was just being crazy. She turned her head.</p> <p>"Get on with it," she said.</p> <p>"You can't possibly be serious."</p> <p>"I just can be."</p> <p>"You're serious and you're hot."</p> <p>She could imagine. She just couldn't. "Now."</p> <p>"You don't have to. You know the rules."</p> <p>"Rules."</p> <p>"They're rules."</p> <p>He moved in behind her and put his hands to her shoulders.</p> <p>"They're rules. I'm your husband."</p> <p>His hands moved down over her hips. He felt her back, his hands on her cheeks. He pulled her into him so she wouldn't feel. His cock pressed against the crack of her ass. His cock felt different than she had remembered. He was harder, it felt different. He moved in behind her again, his dick in line with her. She felt how close she was to him. She moved. "Get me into you? You want me inside you?" he whispered in her ear.</p> <p>He had put his arms through hers and her. She just didn't move. She didn't think she had the legs to move anyway. When he came back up with his cock at the entrance to her pussy she was so wet she slid across it. It opened her and she was so ready. Not that she really had much choice because his cock was so thick. He pushed it inside her.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," he whispered. "I love you, you little whore."</p> <p>"Oh, fuck."</p> <p>His cock felt as if it were being torn apart inside herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
