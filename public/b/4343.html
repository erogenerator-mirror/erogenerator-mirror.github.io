This is all part of the game, isn't it?</p> <p>"Yes, indeed, it is." She leaned forward and took her free hand and placed it right on his right thigh which made her lean forward again so that her nose almost had the whole of his prick inside it which made her gasp ever so a little.</p> <p>"You look so good like that, Mistress," he said. She turned her head ever so slightly to see his reaction, which was a lot, since she was kneeling on the floor, and pulled his right leg so she could reach the top. She took full advantage of the opportunity, because she did not want to get the panties off, which had come on only moments ago.</p> <p>"Let's go to your dressing room for a bit, Mistress." He didn't say a word, he just nodded his head, like he did to her when she had her clothes off a long time ago and then she followed him, now completely naked, all but for his shoes and socks, as well as her shoes, which she lifted so her shoes were on.</p> <p>She helped him with the shoes and he took the socks off and laid them on the floor. She took her first step on the carpeted floor, and had reached him on her knees when she had reached him. Her mouth was level with his right eye and she saw it peeking out at which point she felt her panties being pulled down. She pulled the gusset into her mouth so that it wouldn't be obvious as they were pulled off and then she looked around again and noticed that the curtain was still open and was swinging on and off, but there was no one out there at this time of the day.</p> <p>"Come with me, dear." She turned around and followed him up a large wooden stairway, where there was a bathroom of sorts and she took his hand to lead him to one side. "Do you have anything in mind?" she asked at last.</p> <p>"Not much, I told you, dear." He nodded, now looking around again.</p> <p>"Let us go into the bathroom there." She gestured for him to follow her and he followed her along the short hallway that led up to a bathroom on the third floor. At the very bottom, they looked a bit like an indoor pool area, which had a little bit of a pool too. He went towards the door and opened it for her, followed by her. She walked into the bath, turning around just in time to see him bend his naked body, with his back towards her, toward her. And then he stepped behind her as she knelt where He was.</p> <p>She looked around again and noticed that there were no people in the hallway. But, she realized, everyone was busy with other things and it was only now that she realized that her panties were hanging around her ankles. She tried to cover her crotch with her right hand. Her left hand seemed to have more clothes on it at this point, so she just stood and watched him as he bent to kiss her on the behind, which made him bend even further. His mouth and nose were pressed against her panties, which he pulled down with all of his strength and then he kissed her on the back from the crack of her butt to the crack itself. She felt his breath on her right cheek when he kissed there, which almost made her melt. He moved his mouth down over the edge where he kissed up the bottom of her other cheek to the top. One kiss, up and over, was all he had to do to find and suck on a nice nipple, which was quite large, actually. He then kissed over the curve of her hips to the top of her hips and slowly moved down, over to her lower belly, down to her slit and then back up. And then back up again, a little lower this time. She knew she could wait no longer.</p> <p>"Oh, you little man." She felt his hands on her ass, pulling it slightly away from his face asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
