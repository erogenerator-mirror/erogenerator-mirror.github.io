I was so upset but couldn't say anything. She said just go for it. I think she will like that. Please don't say anything to Mom."</p> <p>I was just about to try to get up and leave when she said, "I need a break." She put her hand on my shoulder and led me to the bathroom. She turned on the shower and I got in right away. She turned it on and said, "I'm sorry but I can't get much water on you so I need to help you in." She started the water and then told me to get in. I did so and felt how nice it was to be able to wash the chlorine out of the water.</p> <p>She was looking at me sitting back against the side. She had her shirt off and her nipple was looking up at me. I grabbed it and gently rubbed it. Then I pulled the shirt down and looked down at it. It was as perky as she remembered, almost like a cone. I started rubbing my hand over my dick.</p> <p>She pulled her shirt up and started rubbing her stomach. "What else do you do?" She said.</p> <p>"Just look at my dick, she says. I'm getting hard."</p> <p>She was stroking her leg and her chest, and I was rubbing myself.</p> <p>"It seems nice."</p> <p>I started sliding my finger across her nipple as she continued talking, "Does it get hard?"</p> <p>"Yes, hard. It feels funny," and then said: "Go ahead and get ahold of it."</p> <p>So I did. She looked at me and I slid my finger across her nipple and gently held it. Her skin was soft and I could feel it. We stood there for a few seconds, just holding on to each others breast, enjoying the feeling I had been feeling all this time. I felt her hand slide down and pull mine away to my knee. She pulled my leg so that I was up on it. She grabbed my dick and started stroking it. It was hard, but not as hard as she could make it. This girl was different. She made the big mistake of telling me that it was not as big as average guys were.</p> <p>I took her left breast in my hand and I slowly slid my hand round her stomach. Then I slipped my finger under the waistband of her shorts. Her skin was still warm and I liked the feeling. I slid my hand further down her body till it reached her lower belly. I started to slide my finger around, going round but up. I was still holding her breast and she held on to my leg. We were in the tub, me laying back, her on her back. As she started to raise her legs up and down to pull my hand, I slid my hand over her bush and started to slide mine around.</p> <p>She raised her legs up a little and I stopped and started to slide my fingers all the way up to the top. They were very wet now and I felt some moisture. I started to slide my finger down. She grabbed my hand and asked me to stop. I looked in her eyes and she said, "No, this is fine. I want to." Then she lay back down, grabbed my hand and pulled it down to her pussy. "Just play with my lips a little. You know better than to make me put it inside you."</p> <p>I sat there for a second and just looked out of the window and wondered what to do next.</p> <p>Then she said, "I don't think it's as big as John's. It still feels good." I was going to say something but she said, "It's hard to say, but it is pretty good too. You know I like to be on top."</p> <p>I was a little confused. This is an open and closed relationship but we had just met today. I couldn't say anything. She seemed to want to tell me more. That seemed awkward. Then I said, "I'm sorry."</p> <p>She looked thoughtful for a moment and said, "I wanted to tell you but I couldn't, not with you here." She was looking right at my hard dick. It was standing up in the water which was making me feel embarrassed.</p> <p>"No, it's okay, I think John is enjoying you," I said, "He did look pretty good when I was doing that when I came in the front door."</p> <p>I took a sip of water then said, "It's not that bad."</p> <p>"Don't try to tell me, he wouldn't."</p> <p>"I don't think you need to know. It's easy to forget that he is older than I am."</p> <p>"I'm not sure, just try.
