Right?"</p> <p>"Yes, I really do."</p> <p>"Well, I can keep them."</p> <p>"Right."</p> <p>I looked down at my little finger then back up at Kelly. "Okay, if you're sure, but I'm not going anywhere tonight."</p> <p>Kelly nodded and said, "I think everything is okay. If he'll let me make love to you any time, no matter how long you stay, I want to try."</p> <p>I smiled at her and said, "Go on and get ready to leave. I'll be by to pick you up. In the morning, that is."</p> <p>I didn't say a word to Kelly before I left my room. As I left my room, Kelly asked where I was going and said there was going to be a special surprise for her. I walked into the master bathroom and said, "Go sit on my bed. I'll be right there. Go on and get ready. I'll be right there waiting."</p> <p>Kelly walked into my room and stood looking at me; I looked down at her and pulled down my swimsuit, "Do you want me to take them off, or should I put them back on?"</p> <p>Kelly nodded and got up to walk around the room, removing the last two pieces of her bikini. "I told you that. Come on. Let that bikini cover you up." I looked down at the front of my suit and saw that everything had come a bit too loosely. "It looks fine. The top looks great too."</p> <p>Kelly held her arms out and gave a little wiggle. "Come on. We'll leave the bottoms on your body."</p> <p>"You're so mean."</p> <p>Kelly turned and smiled at my response. "We can change that." She put the suit down on the bed and then lay down on it. She spread her legs and I kneeled in front of her and placed the swimsuit over her breasts. I couldn't believe how smooth her skin was, it was so soft. I leaned down and kissed her lips as I began to kiss my way up her body to the front of her body. She was lying on the bed, her legs lying on top of each side of me.</p> <p>I kissed my way up that incredible body of hers, slowly getting to her neck. As I got to her lips, I kissed and licked down her throat to the top of her breasts. "You smell lovely."</p> <p>"Thank you, Master. Very."</p> <p>Then it was my turn to be surprised and I began to lightly suck those wonderful tits with those gorgeous nipples in my mouth. It was the best sensation on earth. I kissed down her stomach and kissed down closer to her lips. I began to kiss down her legs and kissed between her legs. She spread them for me. My legs opened so that her pussy was almost on top.</p> <p>We watched each other, kissing, as she started to take her swimsuit off. "No, don't. I want you naked."</p> <p>I took off my swimsuit and laid down next to her, just as she had done. She took a step forward and spread her legs with mine. She looked at me and said, "You can move, but if you do, there'll be pain."</p> <p>She reached between us and put her hand between her legs, making a wet wet spot on the covers.</p> <p>I took my hand out from between us and said, "Can anyone come in?"</p> <p>"No, not until morning," she said.</p> <p>We got up and went out our back door. I had the bed under control by then. It felt so good, having her lying there naked. We went back to her room, my eyes looking at her body as she lay there. The light was getting brighter so that I could see her more easily.</p> <p>I undressed and moved to the bed next to her. I took my arms and reached for her. Her hand moved to my cock and took it in her hand and rubbed it up and down. We kissed again, more passionate than before. After a little more kissing, I began to stroke her. I felt her hand move down to my balls and massage them as I had been stroking hers before. We began to kiss again.</p> <p>She put her lips to mine and our tongues began to dance. We kissed for several more minutes, taking in the taste of her lips. Kelly was feeling pretty good as well. She broke our kiss, "Can I have your cum, to makeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
