I loved her with every fiber of my being and I wanted her even more when the night was over.</p> <p>"I've got a date tonight," I said. I never called her 'dates' in my life although I've heard those words for years. It was always 'just friends,' just friends.</p> <p>As the evening wore on, and I got more and more attracted to her, I also got a little bit scared. There was something about her that made me think that her and I should start dating. But then something else made me remember we would be best friends if we were even half as good as we were in the world of dating.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I whispered. It was so hard to breathe the last few moments of these feelings of desire I experienced. I took a hold of myself and looked at her. "I'd really like to be the one to ask you up to my room."</p> <p>"Oh!" She giggled as she got up, turned around and got out her phone. Her cheeks lit up when she saw that I was not the only one that had changed my mind. "You haven't changed your mind yet have you?" She walked back to me and sat on the couch. As she looked at me, my eyes moved to her chest. I couldn't help but stare at her cleavage that looked so amazing that it looked like it would stop at her bellybutton.</p> <p>I was surprised that she had no problem seeing me admiring her tits so much that night. However, she didn't have any problems taking my breath away by my lustrous appearance. In some ways, if she did, she looked even more appealing that you would expect.</p> <p>"I have to go," she said. I moved to walk away and she hugged me again for a moment. I had almost forgotten how hot her body had really been, that she still wanted me.</p> <p>"Wait, wait!" She said. Then a little smile crept onto her face. "Oh, don't be upset. I know you like me a lot and you do like me. But I know you like me and I'll make it up to you." She reached up and pulled my face down to hers and we were soon locked in a deep, soul searching kiss.</p> <p>It was very soft and felt so good. It was like we both knew it all, except there was more to it than just that. After it happened, I felt her tongue go into my mouth, I responded by sucking it a little harder and feeling it come out. It was so soft and tasted so nice. It was like we were lovers as we kissed in a way that could be said only by the best. But I could never know what that feeling would be like to find me as much as it was me. So my first time with anyone seemed more of a challenge right now.</p> <p>She broke the kiss and got up. She walked over to the dresser and started looking through her drawers. I followed her gaze toward a shelf that she bent over, I felt her firm backside move slightly. She bent forward until the back of her head was on the bed and she looked over at me. She smiled and put herself back to normal and I knew she wasn't just showing off what was inside the clothing she always wore to bed. It seemed like I was the only one who could see it all.</p> <p>As she was bent over, I felt my erection getting harder again. I didn't know when my erection had gotten hard, but I could feel it throbbing with it, if my imagination was accurate. I just prayed that there were no lights on in her room. I wanted to look at everything. I wanted to relive this experience every time I saw her. It would never be the same for me again, but it would be the memory when I do remember it.</p> <p>She was back at the top of the pile of clothes lying around. She turned around on the bed and sat down on the edge of it. In the dim light of the room, she looked like a goddess. She lifted her arms to her neck, then slowly and seductively pulled her shirt up until her large breasts were free of any support they might have been if they had remained confined to the confines of these clothes. Then she pushed her bra up, exposing her breasts to my desire. She ran her hands up over her breasts, rubbing and caressing herself.</p> <p>I saw her hard nipples, they were clearly visible in the light of her bedroom. Then I stopped myself from taking my eyes off her and looking in her eyes. I wanted to look into those beautiful eyes of hers and to see exactly what they looked like.</p> <p>Suddenly, she leaned forward again and I found that she was now looking into my eyes.
