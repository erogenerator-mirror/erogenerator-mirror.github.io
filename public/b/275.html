Feel, feel." I felt one of those things, this strange feeling that is like warm velvet against my fingertips, and it made me weak in the knees. Just feeling, holding her, looking at her, felt like a thousand thoughts racing through my mind.</p> <p>One of my hands felt up her thigh, and I could feel the heat, the dampness. Her hand was now in a different position, one that was no longer so far away. This was a real physical thing.</p> <p>'Mmm, I like this.' She leaned over me so that she was almost lying on me, and her thigh was now touching my erection. She was rubbing me with her hand and I knew her breasts were now in my hands.</p> <p>My other hand moved to the center of her body, and I was massaging my aunt's right breast as we watched the TV in our minds' eye. I felt the nipple that was now harden in my palm, and my aunt's breath caught. It was like a small jolt of electricity, and it made it hard to keep my eyes open. I was staring at her. I knew my nipples were in the way of my cock, and the way her breast felt.</p> <p>Momma was now standing up, and she was looking down towards my face. As Mom started to unbutton her blouse, and as I watched, she brought one of her breasts to my lips, and I did, for a minute.</p> <p>I was so overwhelmed by this feeling that I was completely uncoordinated. I tried to think of a plan or a plan that was appropriate to give her a proper show. But I could think of something else. I was so lost in it, that I didn't even notice the two of them standing up to me.</p> <p>Mom put her arms around my head and pulled me down on the bed with her.</p> <p>"Oh, Auntie! I can't believe how much you've grown!" She kissed me again on the mouth, and she pulled my night shirt over my head. The feel of her hands on my skin, and of her soft hair against mine, was a whole new experience.</p> <p>Mom had stripped naked in all her nakedness. From her hips to her thighs, I saw the curve of her buttock and the tiny swell of her vagina. Like the rest of her body. I wanted to touch her, to be caressed, to lick her, to make love to her. But I couldn't get a grip on my sanity. She had her head back on my shoulder, and her lips were pressed to my ear. "It'll be okay, you just remember how you're going to be. I won't be able to walk again... I promise."</p> <p>I had no idea what she was talking about, but I did believe her when she said I was going to be okay. "If we'll keep you, and I'll keep you too, you'll get used to it."</p> <p>"It'll be okay," I said. "Just go to sleep... I'll go back to sleep." I started to get very tired, as she took my cock in her hand and began to stroke me again.</p> <p>While I lay staring at the television, my mind was in a spin, and I couldn't keep my eyes open. I couldn't think straight. I wanted, so badly, but I also knew I couldn't let it happen. I must have passed out from the exertion.</p> <p>I awoke suddenly. It was dark. I could tell that Mom was still lying with me on the bed. I could smell her and the smell of her and her hair... it was all right. I turned to look at her. She had her arm wrapped around my waist and was looking at me. "You're too tired."</p> <p>She sat up and asked, "Where're Dad?"</p> <p>I reached out and touched her cheek. "Where do you think?"</p> <p>She turned and said, "Do you like it now?"</p> <p>"Yes," I managed to say. "It's... wonderful..."</p> <p>"It can't be," she said. "I'm not sure what I feel. It's wrong, but I'm trying. I need it. I do like being in your arms. Don't you feel the same way?"</p> <p>I took a little time to think about it, and she made me feel better, and I told her the feeling I felt, that I didn't know how good it felt, and she said, "Are you sure I should feel that way?"</p> <p>"Do you like it?"</p> <p>"Mmmm, it feels very good," she said, "I've never felt anything like it before. I couldn't believe it happened, but it felt right.
