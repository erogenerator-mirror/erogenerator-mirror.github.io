First of all, of course, was the fact that I was now 18 -- I would be a year older, and to my surprise, just about all female teachers were my age.</p> <p>Then there was the fact that I'd recently had a minor in art and asked about the classes I was taking. It was always kind of strange for me to be required to take art courses in a school when I already knew an awful lot about it and was really doing a lot more than a few short-sighted math assignments I'd had at college. Now that was different, it was more personal.</p> <p>We'd talked about this a time or two and each of us had brought up the subject of sex. Of course, it wasn't until we had been chatting in the dorm and both had been really turned-on by a girl who, like me, wasn't the sexiest of girls. That she was only a few years older, and that I was, perhaps to my amazement, more than a teenager and that in the past couple of times we'd had sex, I'd been thinking that it was only natural that I should be fantasizing about sex.</p> <p>But in the past we'd talked so much, that we had come to an accord in discussing the subject.</p> <p>The way we were behaving now really surprised me, and as always, I was worried: "Maybe she did want it!"</p> <p>One of us in particular, though, had come to a definite end at the present, and was concerned how she'd react to this news. She usually gave us lots of time to think about our plans after we came back from our day-dreams, but it seemed like there was something coming from the dark side of her she'd not even mentioned to me about. There was a lot of that coming in this conversation now, and she didn't seem upset at all, though, it seemed, when we sat holding each other's hands and talking about the topic of sex.</p> <p>The reason for this, though, was that I knew that she had been thinking about me for a while, and had a few ideas about the way I might make love with her. She knew how much I was interested in her, and I wanted to help her get a better picture of what a man could be like.</p> <p>So when she'd said that she didn't want to go back to the sex life she'd been leading all this time, we talked about it again, and this time I was more than a little concerned. I even began to wonder why she still thought she'd want to have sex with me.</p> <p>Well, I was sure it could work and she was as good to me as I was, but maybe it didn't bother her to be a little "vixen" for me. Maybe it wasn't a problem.</p> <p>And, maybe it wasn't that. Maybe I did like her. Maybe it was something that she shared with me, but maybe it wasn't. Well, maybe I did like her ... maybe it was the way that she came to terms with her sexuality and how strong it was for her to be a teenager. Some people may not want to know what it is for a woman, to feel that a young girl feels as good as I do when I say how lucky I am to be the right man for her ... maybe that's what her story was. Maybe we did know each other better than anyone else and wanted to know each other without saying, "Hey, do you think your girlfriend will like older guys?"</p> <p>But, hey, it was different to me, and it seemed the same to her. I was almost certain, as we talked and got to know each other, that the woman really felt as if her sexual experience should be as important as hers, and that she would be as satisfied as I was in bed with her.</p> <p>And that I'd never felt that much like her before, since I'd never really given my virginity.</p> <p>But then she said the word that we had been talking about, and we could live with that. She said it again and again and yet again and again and again, and I couldn't help but be happy that I was doing something like this, and I could relate to her that she might not ever truly be satisfied with me, that she might even want something that I could never give to her in any way.</p> <p>Well, I suppose what I mean to say that was, I don't have a lot of experience with being a virgin. It's probably a small part of it, but it's still a big part and you can see into the future.</p> <p>One thing my teacher who I had sex with was a woman of many years my senior. There it was: she was a friend of the teacher who had taught me about sex.
