"I hope you're not just taking me for granted because I'm a lesbian or something."</p> <p>"Nah, I'm sorry. I just figured it would be easier if I said it was a relationship, that was it."</p> <p>"Uh-huh," I said, with a small smile of satisfaction.</p> <p>"Oh and don't you dare call me another dyke or a lesbo either," she said playfully as though it was already a valid statement, making me laugh, her eyes sparkling.</p> <p>"Oh, I won't," I said sarcastically. "Actually, it's okay because it turns me on too."</p> <p>"Well then maybe I'll give a thought then," she said with a grin.</p> <p>With a sexy grin I said, "Well it definitely turns me on."</p> <p>"I mean, that would seem weird," she said, looking at me a little closer as she sat down next to me, her arm moving through mine again, her arm touching mine, her hair falling softly over my shirt.</p> <p>"No, it just makes me so hot that I'm sure you don't want to take my word for it," I teased her, laughing at my own predicament.</p> <p>"Well then it'll be okay. It could work at least once anyway," she replied as she moved her hand up over my cheek and looked at me, smiling at me.</p> <p>"Well, here goes," I said as I leaned over and kissed her cheek, moving my hand down from her cheek to her waist, caressing her leg a little and moving up to her inner thigh, making her groan and squirm on the couch.</p> <p>"Nope, I'm definitely not going any where," she moaned loudly, trying to get up off the couch with her thigh.</p> <p>I smiled at her and let her slide off, turning her onto her side and pulling her hair out of its soft wet curl that fell over her shoulder. I smiled at her sexy body as I moved off of the couch and got up behind her, her legs parting.</p> <p>"Oh, you really do know how to tease," she said seductively as she placed her arms around me. "I think I'm going to start feeling so sexy." I placed my arms over hers to hold her and we kissed, slowly working our way up and down. We did it for a bit but it felt way too short to really enjoy any more after so much of the excitement of the evening.</p> <p>Finally I broke the kiss, my hand still over her breast, feeling as sexy as I had in the past, and said, "I have to go," as I stood up and turned facing her.</p> <p>I was already out of my panties and I walked right past her, going down stairs, leaving her in the hallway after dropping my panties on the floor. I opened the door to her room and as I walked in I saw that she didn't see my door open, she was leaning on the door. She was completely naked with her legs spread widely, her fingers pulling her clit hood out, one hand pulling it aside, the other buried in her pussy as she furiously fucked herself with two fingers. I walked in as well, finding her on her back, her eyes were closed and she was moaning very loudly.</p> <p>I closed the door and we stood there for a second. She was panting and I knew I was breathing hard as I stared at her. She opened her eyes and said, "I hope we're in there somewhere," as she lifted her arm up.</p> <p>I had seen her masturbate several times in the past so it wasn't a shock, as she was very sexy as well, and she would do anything I wanted to do in addition to being a good wife. She had her eyes closed and was moaning loud and hard as she fingered herself, one finger moving in and out of her pussy, her other hand grabbing her breast, rubbing her clit.</p> <p>I moved her hand off her breast and she stopped moving and looked at me with a little smile all over her face. She ran her fingers over her mouth and I just shook my head and then said, "I think I'm about to come." She lifted her hips and her eyes opened to look at me.</p> <p>Without thinking she got on her knees and pulled off of my panties with one hand, tossing them onto the bed without breaking her gaze. She looked up at me and then said, "Go ahead and join me so we can really give each other a show." She quickly got down off the floor in front of me, her face just inches from my dripping wet vaginaâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
