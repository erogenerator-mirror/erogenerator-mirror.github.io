I figured I'd let her try to have an honest conversation but instead I just stood there and watched her thinking.</p> <p>'OK. So.. well, would you just stand there and just take your panties off, I mean right in front of him'</p> <p>She sat there with her eyes closed and I could see her breathing was getting very very hard. I wasn't sure I could go through with it but it wasn't hard to make the situation better so I sat down so she was sitting right next to me. She looked at me with questioning eyes but didn't say anything just just let her eyes just roam over me. She didn't say anything about looking a bit at the bulge in my panties. She just sat there.</p> <p>I didn't know what to do. It was obvious that the only thing she was seeing was the bulge and the fact that she was looking at me. Just then I felt bad about being so direct. I sat there trying to keep me eyes on her and tried to think of a way to ask her more of the question, "How do you do it? You're not going to tell anyone?"</p> <p>'Well, I guess I could try, if you want'</p> <p>She jumped up and got back on her knees so she could look closer at me. I knew she wanted to ask more of the answers but didn't know what to say. I just stared at her staring at me with a very worried expression on my face.</p> <p>'What? Why are you staring at me so much?'</p> <p>It occurred to me that maybe this was the right thing to do. We'd never acted that way towards each other before. Maybe this is the first time we've talked about sex like that. Maybe I'm getting too much information from her. Maybe this was not the time or the place for us to be together like this.</p> <p>I just sat there staring at her.</p> <p>'Are you staring at me all the time?'</p> <p>'I guess I am. I mean, every other guy here is the same looking as you are'</p> <p>'Did the guys in here do this to you too?'</p> <p>'A little bit actually, actually we did. We liked what we saw, the way you looked at me in that bathroom'</p> <p>'So is that why you're showing off your tits?'</p> <p>'Well, I thought you were too shy to come back there, I mean we've got this place so it wouldn't look weird'</p> <p>'I'm just doing what's right. No one's going to know I'm showing off my tits. Are you shy now?'</p> <p>I was sitting there with a big smile on my face as she looked me over. "Well, you do look hot too, it's just hard not to stare at you all the time'. She smiled back and reached down to me to take my panties off and put them in her pocket.</p> <p>"Do you want to take your shirt off too?"</p> <p>'I guess not, what if I do something? I mean, if I'm getting it bad I could get you in trouble later'</p> <p>'I guess that's for sure'</p> <p>She was a little hesitant and sort of nervous about it. I had to tell her, "Look, don't be nervous about getting naked in front of a total stranger. You can't be too shy when you're dressed like that"</p> <p>She quickly did as requested. She took off her shirt and she was standing just there naked.</p> <p>'I'm sorry, I didn't mean to stare. I just thought it was more comfortable here, no one will be staring at your body'</p> <p>I gave her the best smile I could muster and said, "Well, do you want to take your pants off?"</p> <p>She looked over with a little grin, "Sure hun, and how do you want me to start getting naked?"</p> <p>'I think we might be able to figure this out. This is what we do here at the restaurant, the men are looking at you in ways I've never seen. You must be embarrassed by your body and people are staring at you'</p> <p>'So it's OK, you can get naked"</p> <p>'Nope, it's OK'</p> <p>'OK, you don't have to, it only is if you want to'</p> <p>I just stared at her as she started to take her pants off. After what must have been 5 or 6 seconds of having to look up and to me, I realized what she was talking about. It made me feel a bit guilty for getting caught looking.</p> <p>She walked over to her bag and got out her vibrator. She didn't look at me all that long. Maybe she just doesn't want attentionâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
