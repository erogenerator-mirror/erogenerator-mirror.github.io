I'm really looking forward to my first time as well."</p> <p>When we arrived, he paid me, took my hand and led me to a small changing room.</p> <p>"Go get undressed"</p> <p>I took off my jacket and slipped the blouse off.</p> <p>"You need to get undressed too"</p> <p>I was totally naked when he started undressing, "Do I want to see how big you are?"</p> <p>"No, just get undressed me."</p> <p>With that he helped me back on to the mat lying on the bed.</p> <p>"Now get on all four"</p> <p>"No, you'll fuck me in return."</p> <p>I was confused. He didn't want sex, but he wanted to, and I wasn't sure where that meant going forward, if I really wanted it.</p> <p>"Come over here and put your arms around my neck, we'll go slow and enjoy the sex after this."</p> <p>I was totally confused and it seemed like his reasoning for why he wanted me to leave was for sex. I was so conflicted about going back with him I could barely think straight. My eyes just bugged out and I just kept staring at him.</p> <p>"That's because I'm not sure I want to be with you." I said, still trying to focus and not look at anything.</p> <p>"That's because I want you" he said, kissing me gently.</p> <p>We both started to get hard when I stopped him on his way out.</p> <p>"What are you so sure of I'm not going to get over this?"</p> <p>"Trust me, just trust me, because I want to. If you didn't then you wouldn't be here now"</p> <p>So that was why me, but not him, was feeling so excited about sex.</p> <p>After I undressed we started a hot bath and I was so glad to be clean that I wasn't going to lose a stitch.</p> <p>"This is where I have come to tell you that if I let you in, I won't take no for an answerâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
