I am kind of tired. It feels like we lost our lives in this heat," Jack said as he wiped an area on his face just to the left of his mouth with the back of his hand. "Let's go, before someone walks the two of us home. I need one beer," he stated.</p> <p>"Okay, thanks. I'll have the two of us some cold one. Have a seat at the table and tell me about what happened."</p> <p>"You're right. I guess I was too busy feeling like a little kid," I told him. "You know, I was so hot, I never noticed this day turning out like this," I replied.</p> <p>"It looked like you were really feeling it as we talked," he stated.</p> <p>"I guess we did," I assured him. "At one point I was staring at his eyes a lot. I guess the heat got stronger and I think I might have gone a little crazy, but I had no idea I could feel that way about another guy," I stated.</p> <p>"I don't think that is the case; it will probably be more of a sexual thing for you than it is for me, just to help you feel a little frisky at this point. You really don't need a lot of help right now either," he said with a wink and a smile. "I might even be able to help you lose weight. Would that be OK with you?"</p> <p>"Sure, that'd be great!" I replied. "I really have no problem with that at all," I said. "As long as I'm happy that you like me a little, I'm happy with you. In the meantime, I'm going to go and get dressed and relax for my long vacation day. What do you say?"</p> <p>"Sounds like a plan to me," Jack stated as he walked out of the kitchen with a huge smile.</p> <p>"See you tonight," he whispered as he returned to the table with his head bowed down a bit.</p> <p>"See you later sweetie," I replied as he set down his beer on the table. "I'll have the same," I continued. "I would love to get back in the hot tub when they are done," I continued.</p> <p>"Yes, I will be ready to play," he stated. "It feels great to have a relaxing time."</p> <p>I had to know one thing. Jack and I had talked about that day more than I had been talking about it with one of my own kids. I think that was partially the reason why he wasn't interested in anything sexual with me anymore and that was just the hot sex session we had shared. He had also known I would be into a little bondage so that is what he was going to ask me to do with my new friend as he got off. My husband was going to get off too, but I told him I was only going to be with him the whole night so that would work out for itself, too. I knew this was probably going to be a very memorable weekend as a result of all the sex he had experienced that day. I decided to see if I could find some way to encourage him in a way just the way he was feeling. Jack was still so horny, he would probably have fucked me in the middle of the next two days if I really wanted to be able to get him off. So I decided to see what it was that I had in mind for him.</p> <p>As I walked back up to our room, I decided the next step was to shower before he got home, so I could put out the day away before we got out of the hot tub, so I removed my panties. I was still naked under my robe when Jack entered the door. He had shed his robe while he was out earlier so he was naked. He looked so masculine like that he looked like the epitome of masculinity, I thought.</p> <p>He looked at me with a smile and told me that he had to leave, because he really enjoyed what had just happened so much. "I would love to, but I'm really too tired. I'm going off in a little while, so maybe we should finish what we started," I stated. "Do you want me to stay a little while?" I asked.</p> <p>"Actually, that is not on your agenda yet," he stated. "I just thought maybe you could stay a little while just to make sure I still feel like I need some help. I know what you like to do and will be willing to try," he told me.</p> <p>"That would be great, I'm sorry I missed the show with you," I said as I handed him my handkerchief.</p> <p>"It's fine," he assured me as he handed me my handkerchief and told me to leave the room and be prepared to get out when we got home. He then leftâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
