I can live with it for a bit, we still have time.'</p> <p>'Is it the other way?'</p> <p>'Why not?' she asked.</p> <p>'Well, don't you agree with what I'm saying?'</p> <p>'Well, I don't know. You have no idea. So what happened?'</p> <p>'Well, I... I went over and kissed her. Well, I... I guess I did. It wasn't the sort of thing she goes for, or anyone she knows really, but... well, I was being a bit too... well, you know what I mean?'</p> <p>Natalie was clearly having an effect on me. I really didn't care what she went off to do. I could just enjoy the night for myself, I knew that I would be able to talk my way out of that. I was determined to make the most of this moment if necessary, and I wanted her to feel that I was there for her and not just a little kid.</p> <p>'I guess I did, and if you want me to leave you to it, go for it and try it. Just give some thought and then tell me a story and I'll listen.'</p> <p>I could tell she was worried, but at the same time she was clearly not complaining that I had kissed her. I felt a bit proud of myself for thinking what I had felt, and she seemed less bothered by it.</p> <p>'Okay, I will," she said.</p> <p>She looked over at the bedside clock, "I'm going to be late for class. What time is it?" she asked.</p> <p>'I'll pick you up at seven. Don't be late.' I said. After a quick kiss, I had my own thoughts about who it might possibly be. As she had said, maybe this wasn't such a bad idea after all.</p> <p>'And...?'</p> <p>'What do you think?' I asked.</p> <p>'I guess...'</p> <p>'I'll be late,' I said, 'maybe early, but it's possible.'</p> <p>'Really? Okay,' she said sounding relieved.</p> <p>Natalie and I went to her room to lock up and get ready for class. A short time later, I knocked on her door, "Is that you?" she yelled.</p> <p>"Sorry," I replied, "you can come in now, Natalie."</p> <p>Natalie opened the door a split second before I knocked again "Nope," she said.</p> <p>"Come in," I said, "can I have something to drink?"</p> <p>My eyes went wide as I saw my mother in law in her birthday suit sitting on her bed.</p> <p>"No, I'll come into your room too, you can get yourself cleaned up first."</p> <p>"I didn't mean to startle you," she said. "I don't feel like going in. I just don't think... well... I'm all sticky right now."</p> <p>"It's okay," I said, "you know that's okay. I'll be okay."</p> <p>I went into the bathroom and got myself ready. As I turned the water on, I decided not to say goodbye to her. Instead I went over to the bed and sat down on it. A few seconds later, I heard her get out of her suit and come to the bathroom. When she came in the door, her eyes lit up like a Christmas tree, and she gave me a big hug hugging.</p> <p>'Thank you,' she beamed at me. "For everything."</p> <p>'I know,' I smiled. It was a good thing that she felt good about herself too. 'You are my best friend ever.'</p> <p>"I'm glad," she replied. She was still a little breathless, as she'd been a few minutes ago when we got in to the tub. "I think I'm getting a little ticklish," she said.</p> <p>"Okay," I agreed as I watched her go into the bathroom. I could feel my heart beginning to beat a little faster right as she left my room. For a while, I just sat in bed and watched her walk from the bathroom to the bedroom, and she looked so happy that I felt like I had grown old. After about five minute, she came back to find me in the bathroom. I couldn't help but look at her.</p> <p>"Hey there, I need to go see if my makeup is okay," she said.</p> <p>"Sure," I said.
