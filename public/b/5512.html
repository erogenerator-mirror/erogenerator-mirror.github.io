I asked, taking another step across the floor toward her.</p> <p>Still in a daze from her earlier conversation, she nodded to me and I took a step back a step, and when I came in contact with her, she turned her face to mine. She took a large hand full of my hair as we gazed into the other's eyes, our lips touching for an instant. My hands wrapped around her waist to stop her from pulling me toward the bed, her other hand went back to my hair. We kissed deeply for a bit but it didn't stop there. It slid down my neck to my chest, and I felt the back of her fingers against my nipple through the thin silk of my shirt and belt as we continued to kiss, and both of our bodies began to tingle. Soon, my shirt fell away to expose my shoulders and her hands worked their way under my t-shirt, up my stomach and over my head. She was feeling every centimeter of skin on the way, and when she reached around and unhooked my bra, her hands slipped the straps off my shoulders and her lips kissed their way down my neck as she did so, kissing along my collar, then working to my cleavage.</p> <p>It felt wonderful, and it was only getting better, as her kisses got lower, past my nipples, across my belly, and down to the top of her panties. My hands were on her back, lightly stroking her, and when she moved her hand from under my shirt, I slid my fingers under her bra to find her nipples, then back up through the soft fabric. She moaned into my mouth when I found a way to slide her panties off and then onto the floor near her shoes. Then, while I slid my hands around her waist to unclasp her bra, her hand was between her legs, rubbing the front of my pants and teasing my erection. When she released my mouth from hers, she lifted my shirt over my head, revealing my breasts to the cool night air, and her hand moved to my bra, undoing it. I felt her breasts on my chest as she helped me lower the straps off her arms, and when she slid her hands below mine to release them, I looked down to see a small triangle of hair just above her belly button. She was so beautiful.</p> <p>"Do you think we should go further?" I whispered as I sat on the floor, my shirt falling to the floor and laying there on the floor.</p> <p></p> <p>"Oh yes," she responded as her panties got pushed down her legs and off, and her hands immediately pulled my top off me.</p> <p>I lay with my back against an empty bed. I had only taken the shirt off when I felt the bed beside me, and I could feel her hands touching me everywhere as she slowly lowered myself onto the bed. I could feel her weight on top of me, and felt her kiss my face.</p> <p>"How do you like it here?" she said, just before she lowered herself onto me.</p> <p>"It's nice, the bed is so soft."</p> <p>"You like that? Your shirt is soaked. I like that. It's soft against your tits."</p> <p>"My bra's soaked too," she answered. "But you know we're not together, right?" I nodded as her hips rode me up and down, and when she lifted herself from her knees to straddle me, I found her panties to be soaking wet. I could feel her pubic hair against my balls as she slid herself up and down, my erection sliding inside her.</p> <p>"I want to try it. On your back for now as you feel my body on yours a little better. You'll feel the wetness from my vagina, after we finish." My hands came up to her waist to pull her down to me, and she quickly did the same and began rocking faster, kissing me back. Her mouth was on the back of my neck from behind as her pelvis pounded me faster, and I felt her hand on my erection all the way to my belly, and I felt it, as it shot stream after stream of my seed into her pussy. She gasped through the kiss as she came, collapsing down on me as our chests pressed together, our legs wrapped around each other. I could feel the cum running down the crack down my legs, soaking into me, running down into her and our arms and bodies.</p> <p>We laid like that for a while after we got ourselves together, and I felt a little of my tension leave me, so I kissed her back. "Are you still worried about tomorrow?" she asked. I shook my head.</p> <p>She pulled herself up off me. "Not with the world, I will, but I want to go tonight anyway, if youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
