I heard a male voice say something in a language I didn't understand. "Don't worry, it will be fine."</p> <p>"My car is out front." And with that, I felt the warmth of my husband's body wash my body from inside and slowly washed every last part of me. And finally he was gone.</p> <p>Once outside, and the shower door closed, I realized my mind had gone a different direction as well. But no, instead I wondered where he had taken me.</p> <p>As I stepped into the shower, and began washing myself, I couldn't see anything outside the wall for hours. The water was cold and I needed to get rid of it. I wondered if I would come across a strange man again. I hoped I would. At the very least I would have the chance to spend a quiet day, watching some movies with an Indian movie, and maybe do some shopping and relax. But I have a job interview coming up. And I am going to miss this. There is nothing for today. And I can't do anything about this without his help again.</p> <p>The water stopped as I stepped back out and saw only the reflection of the mirror. As I exited the stall, I couldn't shake the feeling in my stomach that I had come to this realization about myself. A part of me was disgusted at losing this thing, but a bigger part of me was enjoying the idea that he left a woman unsatisfied for another man. And maybe for me?</p> <p>I reached for the soap and began to lather myself up. But when I realized I was doing it for him, I knew that I had to do that for him. I was so glad he hadn't seen me like this. I took a shower, turned off the water, and walked back into the bedroom. I could feel my mind beginning to shake. And the more I thought about how things had changed, the harder it became. And the more I thought about being rejected by this man. So different in every aspect.</p> <p>I picked my bra off the floor and walked barefoot to my dresser, and put it on. Then I headed to my closet to check my underwear and dresser. I found a white flannel robe on the door handle and went back to the living room. My heart was pounding in my chest. So much had happened today. What if I ended up seeing this man again? What if a little romance was the ticket into my life?</p> <p>As I was looking at my bra, I noticed the same thing my husband had done earlier. But it seemed different now. And so much more comfortable. And so...more erotic? And more...sexy than the cold water I washed earlier. That's not what I had for him.</p> <p>I turned around and saw that as I was turning my back towards him, the robe's top had slipped open. The white flannel was now down over my back, and my breasts were exposed. I turned towards him again. He stood there in the bathroom doorway, like he was expecting me to come up there to be in my bra. But instead, he looked directly up at my breasts and smiled. He seemed shocked at the thought that maybe he would touch my skin, kiss, suck, and even bite my breasts. After the shower, and a very quiet drive home, I was wondering if he would take me upstairs, to continue our fun. But it seemed the opposite would have been the case.</p> <p>I turned to face him, as I felt him slide slowly down the wall. I turned back and looked up again. I could see that the bottom half of his upper body hair was gone. But my eyes immediately dropped to the outline of his body. I almost wanted to say something, but I couldn't. So I just kept looking at the wall.</p> <p>I felt him pull something from his jeans pocket. It seemed to have been an item I had never heard of. And it was a small device. Maybe six and a half inch or so. With the end of it, it wrapped around another item, and then around my back. It was long, and curved up. It looked like something big as a broom handle.</p> <p>I felt myself getting aroused. It turned out that this thing was something I had probably never seen, as I looked down in disappointment at the black leather cuffs. They were long and strong, but were so thin I saw my reflection in the mirror. I couldn't even get my mouth to even consider giving him a hard-on. I must have looked ridiculous, but at least now I would feel more like myself. I looked back down at the thing and saw that it was a pair of leather sandals with long leather straps attached. I suddenly felt embarrassed, and ashamed that I had looked so submissive to aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
