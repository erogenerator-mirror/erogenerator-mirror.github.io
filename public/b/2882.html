You did great, and I'll certainly miss your company."</p> <p>"Of course not."</p> <p>We talked a little more, and I showed her the rest of our weekend, including my plan to drive her to Dallas, and her parents coming in to collect her. I had rented a movie, and I was excited as well as a little nervous. When we finally left that evening, it was a miracle we got home. I was going to try to see some more of my work, but I decided to go home to spend it with my girlfriend. I had found out she was going to be in high school in Ohio State, and she was transferring to Ohio State from her first week in September. That meant I wouldn't be in any real good hands with her now. She seemed pretty happy that I was going there too. I'd been feeling a little guilty about it in the past, but now I didn't. I could live with that, at least for as long as she wanted to stay.</p> <p>"Well, if you're free, I'm sure I can call you." I told her at the door, hoping she would think it wasn't a joke.</p> <p>"Oh, you know I probably will, too, but I'm good, what do you say?" She had already turned the car around to where her friend was standing, staring me with her big brown eyes as I drove away on a Sunday afternoon. We never spoke again after that, and she wouldn't have been nice. She was more the same way, but we hadn't spoken in years.</p> <p>I tried calling her twice more, and she was out of her house the following night to go to school, but she was out by herself. I called her at home, and asked where the time was, and she was there when I picked her up at 9:00 a.m.</p> <p>"I'm glad you called, I wanted to talk with you about you and me." I told her before I drove awayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
