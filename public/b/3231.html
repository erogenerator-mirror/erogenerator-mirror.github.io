I like what I like...I mean, you know I don't know if I want to."</p> <p>"No, I didn't mean by that...and I don't care," she said, with a mischievous grin.</p> <p>She reached up and held the back of his head. He shivered again as her fingertips brushed just under his ear. "I'm not going to make you..." she asked, while she stroked his cheek, but he did it.</p> <p>He was a bit nervous about being with a woman who wanted to be controlled. His heart pounded in his chest and he felt a tinge of anxiety, but knew there weren't any lines. If he could stop being nervous about being around her, he might just be able to.</p> <p>"No," was his only reply, and he took her hand. They walked up the sidewalk toward the theater door. He walked up and pulled the door open slowly. The lights were dim but he could plainly see that the theater was dark, and a man and woman sat in chairs in front of the window. This probably wasn't the first theater that had theater lights on the floor, but neither of those places had lights on.</p> <p>"Hello, ma'am," her name, as a man spoke to the woman. They each wore a business shirt and tie, and seemed to be working up a mood. "Nice setting," she said in a voice that sounded like a whisper.</p> <p>"Thank you," she said to him. He didn't pay it much mind to address her, he just walked up to be with her. "Well," he said when she made eye contact, "if you're looking for any movies or shows, let me know and we can pick something. We can even go on a trip."</p> <p>His voice took on a mocking tone as he continued to walk up behind her. "No, I'm looking for more movies..."</p> <p>She reached up with one hand, and pulled him into a passionate kiss.</p> <p>When she had finished, they both stood in the doorway of the theater, and leaned against the doorframe. "Let's find something else," she said with a grin, "we'll see about that."</p> <p>At that moment, there were two people walking down a hallway that had no lights on. They were both in their late thirties, but definitely in their sixties. Each guy was the sort of guy who could only be described as "nice." They both had wavy brown hair, which was often cut in two. While their shirts were the same color as theirs, each wore a button down button down shirt with a couple buttons undone, and had an open necked shirt with a couple different buttons undone.</p> <p>The guy on the left had a short white and red and blue work shirt and a casual white shirt. The guy on the right had a black shirt and dark blue work pants. Both had open collars under their shirts and tight shirts and jeans. Their shirts were tied behind them and they all sported the same buckle and button fly button down shirt. Their pants and pants appeared to be the same color, with the same style.</p> <p>The two men on the right were the kind of men that seemed to work out a lot in the gym. Both wore baggy work clothes. Their jeans were short and the fit the same and went on with an open neck. From their pants and pants, they obviously had an athletic build, and if I wasn't walking down the street, I would have known they were both muscular men with a powerful chest.</p> <p>They were both holding a couple of magazines. He had read several of the papers and was writing in them. I tried to read one, but they said that it was for entertainment only. I found that hard to believe, considering that I had just kissed my woman. The two men sat on the coust of two couches, and were just looking at each other. He leaned toward her and spoke. "I thought we were going to see something else...", he said rather than said anything. He leaned away and nodded toward the door ahead. I could see that they both had an erection. I wondered what the guy behind the desk looked like to me.</p> <p>He went over to the door, leaned back against the door frame and looked at her. "You like my office, don't you, ma'am?" He gestured to a large desk in the middle, and a large, leather chair in the other one. She looked at him with wide eyes while nodding her head in his direction.</p> <p>He reached up his hand and touched her chin and then brought her face down to kiss her. She leaned into me and I could tell she could feel that his hand was all over her. She let his kiss trail down over her cheek and chin to a small button on the shirt that heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
