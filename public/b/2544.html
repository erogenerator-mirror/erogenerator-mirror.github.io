We found the one.' He looked up from his notes and paused, and she sighed in relief.</p> <p>'I'm sorry it happened like that. I tried to warn you as I saw your injuries before, I could tell you, but it was too late for that now.' He stared at his notes, then looked up again. 'Would it be too much to ask me to come back and see you?'</p> <p>'If I'm all right, I won't. It was really nice to have both of you, it felt weird, but it was...you're beautiful too, and we've fallen in love and you two are the best thing that's happened to my life since we got here.'</p> <p>'It's nice to be home again.'</p> <p>'I know, so what do you want to do, go home? Get back to yours? Or you want to go somewhere else?' She looked down into her hands for a minute and decided, 'I can make it, I don't need the house, but I don't see why not?' She looked back at him, 'You've been the best husband I could ask for, and now you think it's right? There's nothing to be concerned about now, but it won't be enough if I stay here and wait.'</p> <p>'That's ok.'</p> <p>He grinned, 'I'd say yes, we'll have to talk about it at supper in the evening, and again after that, but for now I think it's best not talk about it now.' He stood and took a last look at her, then grinned and left the room.</p> <p>A few hours later they were in her bedroom on the second bed, and he was kissing her, their mouths locked in a passionate kiss, their hands exploring each others naked body. She moaned, as he touched her, and soon had her naked body covered with his as she lay beneath him, one of her legs either side of his, his face buried in her neck and shoulder, kissing him wherever she could reach.</p> <p>He began to move slowly inside her, and in spite of herself it felt amazing, just a little. 'Is this what you want, don't you want it all the time?' she asked as the slow rhythm built inside her, he kissed the top of her head.</p> <p>'Only if you can make it last long, I'm not that far off yet.' She looked at the ceiling, 'I love that, it's lovely,' she sighed as his cock filled her once again. And it was glorious. It had been the most powerful time she had had in a long time, and it had lasted a long time too.</p> <p>He lifted her as his body thrust up into hers with each deep thrust, his hands kneading her butt as they kissed, and when he could not hold back anymore he plunged into her as he could, they rocked together until he came and they both came again. And this time, he could not stop moving until the tension of their union passedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
