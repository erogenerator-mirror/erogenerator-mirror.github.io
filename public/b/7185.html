The woman that she didn't recognize sat in a chair, one that had an antique looking cushion over it. She had short brown hair, a bit of a moustache, no makeup, and her body had the same type of hourglass shape that had attracted the guys to her all through high school.</p> <p>A guy, who she guessed must be in his late 20s walked up to her, "Hi, I'm Bill," and the young man who had introduced himself, he shook her hand, while she shook his. "I'm Jack, and this is my wife Julie, our new friend." Then Bill went on to say something else, and the two continued to talk.</p> <p>By the time Bill came back with another man, Julie was almost finished, and the next thing was another introduction, this time by her sister Julie. The woman who had joined them was in her late 40s, also wearing a robe and looked like a school girl, but a real teacher.</p> <p>As they walked together around the room, both men tried to maintain eye contact. "So, is this your wife's husband?" one of them asked.</p> <p>"Yes" Julie responded. "What do you think?"</p> <p>"She might want to take a step and see you for herself."</p> <p>And Julie smiled. "My pleasure" she said as she turned to walk off towards them.</p> <p>Bill, in his own defense, had a way of looking at her as they approached, although he did not say a thing in their conversations.</p> <p>As they got to her, she put her hands on his shoulders and bent down to kiss him on the cheek. Bill smiled and then grabbed her ass and pulled her in close.</p> <p>He put his arms around her and pulled her against him. She liked that. And then Julie leaned back and said, "Jack, you might be my husband, but I love my man."</p> <p>"That's nice."</p> <p>"So, is our wife your woman?"</p> <p>Jack looked around the room, and then said to Julie, "If it's not, I've got my friend John, who's also my girlfriend in the Army, by the way."</p> <p>"Oh my!" replied Julie. "I'm the same way, dear."</p> <p>"Oh." Bill looked quizzically at her. "Well Julie," he continued, "in about 5 years. We were having sex regularly for a whole year, and you didn't mind?"</p> <p>"Why, of course I did. What do you think?"</p> <p>"Well, you've got it. But I wonder where you got it from."</p> <p>"I don't, and I don't either!" she answered.</p> <p>"You don't have to if you don't want to, it's okay if you don't like it." And so saying another big hug, and they walked off to Bill's room.</p> <p>As Julie and Bill walked over to their room, Julie leaned right into him and said, "Bill, I'm glad you came." and kissed him on the lips. Then walked off to her room.</p> <p>Jack and Bill stayed the night at the hotel. Julie was still on the phone, when she went to answer the phone. She was happy when she discovered that she hadn't gotten the message that her call had been answered. She also enjoyed her first man since high school.</p> <p>"Hi Julie" said Jack, "I heard you're having a good time."</p> <p>"Oh yes," answered Julie. "And you didn't see any cock, did you?"</p> <p>"No, but we did it with the guys." And then she went to answer the phone. "But, is it a good time? Bill, you're coming to my suite tonight to play with me." And then she hung the phone up.</p> <p>"Hey Jack, you're coming to my room, aren't you?" asked Bill.</p> <p>"Well, yes."</p> <p>"Are you coming to my suite?"</p> <p>"Well yes, I'm coming to your room after dinner."</p> <p>And so he walked up the stairs to his room and stood there for a few seconds, letting the feelings of excitement and anticipation course through his body. Then he grabbed the soap and the razor he'd bought for his trip and slowly started to wash himself with it. He didn't want to feel like wearing a robe, but he didn't care, all he wanted was to feel his hands on his body.</p> <p>He finished his wash, got out of the shower and grabbed the razor, then started to shave his legs. The water running over his thighs was a nice little erotic feeling.
