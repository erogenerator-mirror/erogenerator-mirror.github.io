She's lovely, and I want to make love to her forever. As I stand, I feel the wet patch on my cock with my hand. As I step out, I look in the back, and see her ass pointing directly at me. I grab my dick, and stroke myself as I watch her as she works two fingers inside her cunt to finger herself. As she starts to cum, I tell her to stand up. "Stand over there on the other side of the mirror, facing me."</p> <p>She complies.</p> <p>I reach over, and begin to rub her wet pussy with one finger. In the mirror, I watch her as she begins to rub her clit faster and harder. She gets a little crazy just a minute later, as she cums, and she puts all her clothes back on. She's such a tease. I look at her face, as we walk down the aisle together. I'm a bit more turned on myself than she is, because it's very different from what I did the first time I fucked her, although she didn't have a cock either. After my first blowjob, I still had a fantasy about some guy I know, who is fucking me with a strap-on dildo. But this was her first experience with another dick in her pussy. I felt like I was taking her on another level than it would appear.</p> <p>On the way out she leans into me, to kiss me and kiss me again.</p> <p>"So, what would the boys say if they knew I let you suck my ass hole when I'd just been on the floor?" I say, with a knowing smile.</p> <p>"My cock's throbbing," she replies.</p> <p>"Well, let's hope you didn't leave a drop of precum on your shirt," I say with a wink.</p> <p>"Are you sure you really want me to suck your cock again?" She asks.</p> <p>"I'm sure," I say with a smile.</p> <p>"No, now let's go back into the bedroom. The guys can come out any minute. I still want to give him a blow job."</p> <p>*****</p> <p>It's a long and tiring day for meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
