"You were all like - you know, in my school. I don't know who you are but I would have let you fuck my friends if you had asked," she giggled as she recalled her earlier experiences with her friend Kate.</p> <p>"And I bet a few of them had fun with you, too," he grinned back at her.</p> <p>"Well, I have one little surprise for you, too," she said sweetly. He kissed her long and deep.</p> <p>"Oh, right, well, you have to give me my present," she said wickedly as she squeezed his dick hard. In her drunken state, she felt the wetness on her fingers and in her hand.</p> <p>"You don't have to," he said. "You can just stay here and give me a little present," he continued. "A very nice present."</p> <p>"You mean, like a present for me?" she asked, not at all sure of her own surprise and his request.</p> <p>"I mean...I guess so," he lied.</p> <p>"I don't do presents for people like that," she giggled and turned her back to him. "Well, I do. A present," she said, reaching across to her bag for something in her lap. She looked at him, looked at the way he was smiling at her from his seat. He seemed to enjoy the idea as he saw her wiggling her way out of the limo and down it to her seat.</p> <p>"Here, let me put these on, now. They're not so bad."</p> <p>She reached up, cupped her hands under his large hands and pulled them out to where she had them in her lap. She slid them under her skirt and into his lap in one motion. She rubbed his hands against her bare pussy, and even though the dress she was wearing was so tight, he felt the wetness between her legs.</p> <p>"I need to do something," she said with a mischievous grin as she sat down on her seat and turned to face him. "I guess I should go back inside," she giggled as she slid her hand out of his lap. "Maybe you can give me a ride home," she said in her drunken voice. He grinned. He got a feeling that he would enjoy her, because he had been thinking of her as a little slut in the past while.</p> <p>"You get a chance to see the rest of the sights?" he laughed.</p> <p>"Oh yeah," she replied, giggling again as the limo pulled into another parking lot. "I don't know where I could even go," she laughed as she made her way back inside, into the house.</p> <p>"But...do you have a lot of money?"</p> <p>"I don't get paid just anywhere."</p> <p>"Can...me...get you to a...party?" he smiled.</p> <p>"You bet," she giggled as she started to climb the stairs to his floor. "I'll let you decide that," she laughed as she walked up the stairs to hers, her heart pounding from excitement and the lusting desire from the night of debauchery she found herself immersed in.</p> <p>It was nearly 7.30p.m. when Katie finally got up to go inside. She looked around her house, her eyes finding Kate's and thinking of her being there instead of her husband. She couldn't believe how wet she was, from excitement. She stood at the mirror just as she heard the doorbell ring.</p> <p>As she turned around, she gasped at her reflection. The young, good-looking black girl stood at her doorway, looking at her with a puzzled expression.</p> <p>"Oh, hi, Katie," Katie said, taking in her friend from her short stature and the small, curvy form, the one she had been admiring the night of debauchery she found herself entranced by in her mind.</p> <p>"Do you have a present for me?" she asked as she stood in front of Katie, who was now standing with her hand on her hip.</p> <p>"Sure, sure," the girl responded. "What do you say? Do you have a present for Katie?" she asked.</p> <p>Katie walked over the girl's shoulders and leaned her head back.</p> <p>"Yeah, come over and sit on my lap," she said with a smile as she gave her a playful smack on the knee.</p> <p>"Hey, you guys should come inside," the brunette said in a small voice. She grabbed the young girl's hand and led her away to the living room, leaving her to get out of the way. "Here, you," Katie said, giving the girl's soft, young ass one last swat on the wayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
