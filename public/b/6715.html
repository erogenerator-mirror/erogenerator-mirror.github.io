I'm hungry."</p> <p>She led the way on the elevator, and he followed her to her condo sitting on the couch.</p> <p>"Is it okay if I order room service?"</p> <p>"Sure. Let's make the most of this. I'm still hungry."</p> <p>"I'm glad."</p> <p>They ate their meals together, and talked a little.</p> <p>"I never get tired of seeing you here."</p> <p>"Well, I didn't mean to."</p> <p>"I'm glad."</p> <p>"This is nice."</p> <p>She smiled at him warmly. "It is."</p> <p>"I'm not sure what you're talking about."</p> <p>"I'm serious. I'm more used to being around people."</p> <p>"You're sure you can handle me?"</p> <p>He laughed. "Of course. I just hope that I don't get you in trouble."</p> <p>"You're such an ass."</p> <p>He laughed, as he reached out for her hand. "I'm an ass in my heart, and yours, too."</p> <p>"I'll stop by you later. And thanks for dinner."</p> <p>As the waiter wheeled out the dessert, he looked up at the ceiling and thought about his friends and the fun they'd had. He thought about all their fantasies about him. It was nice to think that he might be thinking one of them. Then he thought about where they'd been the night before. He wondered how he was going to get them out of the house this time.</p> <p>"Where'd we left off that last time?"</p> <p>"Uh, you were in the pool, weren't you?"</p> <p>He turned sideways to her and took her chin in his hand. "That's right. I was." He pulled her face up to him. "And I don't think you're going to like it either."</p> <p>"No," she replied. "I want to play with yours."</p> <p>"Oh. Okay. I can feel that. I don't think I can."</p> <p>"Can I?"</p> <p>He nodded and leaned forward. His lips parted. His heartbeats increased, but he thought that perhaps she wouldn't want to make any overt moves. "I want to see you naked."</p> <p>She grinned. "You were already naked."</p> <p>"I am that."</p> <p>"Well, then, you can't keep your hands off me."</p> <p>"No . . ."</p> <p>"Oh god!"</p> <p>A flush of embarrassment bloomed across their faces. "I'm just trying to help," she said.</p> <p>"That's all I'm asking. Are you willing to touch me?"</p> <p>Biting his lip and biting her lip, she nodded. "I'm serious, Michael," she said. "Can I touch you?"</p> <p>"Let's put it this way."</p> <p>Bending forward, she hooked her thumbs in the waistband of his trunks and pulled them down. His cock popped out and she stared at it, amazed at its size. She couldn't help herself, and she reached out and took it in her hands. The skin was velvety smooth. She leaned back and wrapped her lips around the head of his cock. He could feel the wetness of her mouth sliding on him and he moaned. His hands wandered over her body, and the feel of her soft skin was better than any pussy he'd ever felt. He wondered what they could do, but he'd have to keep his hands off her, just in case. He wanted to suck on or taste her tits first, but it would only be natural for him to suck on hers if she'd let him do that once instead of the last time.</p> <p>"You're so good at sucking cock," he murmured.</p> <p>"Your cock is so soft," she said. "I love the feel of it in my mouth . . . especially since I suck on a cock."</p> <p>Her fingers tightened around him and he groaned.</p> <p>"Can I taste you?" she smiled, just to tease, "or can I suck it?"</p> <p>That seemed like a good suggestion. "Let's take a shower . . . and then I'll take you in my mouth."</p> <p>"If I can go down on you, I can do that," she said.</p> <p>"We'll take no chances."</p> <p>"I'm sure we'll take our time," she said.</p> <p>"Me too," he replied.</p> <p>Their eyes locked. There wasn't any doubt that he wanted her to suck on him. He was so horny that he wanted anything other than to be in her mouth right away. Her hand was sliding up and down his shaft, and he shivered as her warm hand cupped him and squeezed his balls. It wasn't like it was any more arousing toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
