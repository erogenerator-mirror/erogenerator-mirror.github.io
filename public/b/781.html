"No really, I mean... I never ever..."</p> <p>"I know," I answered honestly. "And I thought about doing the same, and just having another girl take my virginity. But I never thought you'd really do it."</p> <p>"Really?" He said. "You're not that big?"</p> <p>"Well, not really... but I didn't think you would. I only went on the pill a little while before we got married. I figured there was no one you could be trusted with taking it."</p> <p>I just smiled at him.</p> <p>"Then I'm sure you couldn't," he said as he looked back down at his hands, the two fingers that had been on the table still slightly touching me. He squeezed my hand again, just as gently as I had been squeezing him and it only took a few more thrusts for me to realize just how good he felt against me.</p> <p>The hand in mine moved it down to my left breast, and I felt him brush his fingers across my nipple. "You are so fucking beautiful" he whispered. "That's nothing I can't have if I ever want it to be the right woman."</p> <p>He kept his hand on my breast, not actually stroking it, just running his fingers across the entire circle of it. I didn't mind at all, in fact it actually felt really good, my nipple becoming rock hard despite all of the stimulation it was receiving.</p> <p>His right hand began stroking my leg as his left slid up it, coming up from around my hip and under my skirt to finally touch the sensitive spot between my thigh and pelvis.</p> <p>"Oh god," I moaned, my entire body tensing with every little jump, not that my hips had gone completely rigid on the floor before, but the first few seconds of this encounter seemed to come naturally to me. His hand felt good across it, and I could feel myself starting to get more and more turned on as he slowly rubbed each of my thighs, his left hand occasionally sliding up to lightly play with my clit.</p> <p>As the first few seconds passed, he slowly increased the pace of everything that he was doing, and soon with the help of my own desire and the feeling of pleasure I was experiencing, I was on the brink of cumming with his touch.</p> <p>"Oh," I moaned into his mouth as my hips began to rise in unison with the wave of pleasure that was starting to overtake me. "That's sooo good." He took his hand off my breast and slowly moved it between us, moving himself down the inside of my thigh and rubbing the same spot that had been stroking me up until now. A few long strokes later he slid his hand under my skirt, moving it up my inner thigh, over the smooth skin of my thigh from my knee to the top of my leg.</p> <p>I moaned into his mouth as his fingertips brushed my clit and my whole body tensed once more.</p> <p>"Oh god, please," I whispered into his mouth, trying to calm myself as his entire hand moved up and down my wet pussy.</p> <p>"Please what?" he asked me between shallow breaths.</p> <p>"Please," I answered between little whimpers. "I haven't cum like that in a week and I haven't made you cum like that. Please let me finish, PLEASE PLEASE!"</p> <p>I was breathing hard enough now that I actually was trying to speak before he began moving his fingers in a circular motion over my clit but it came out garbled so I couldn't even think straight.</p> <p>"Cum for me," he said softly. "Cum for your man".</p> <p>I nodded, my entire body tensing up as the first wave of pleasure hit me, and for a second we both froze. Then I was in his arms, my legs wrapped around his waist, my entire body tingling with pleasure as he continued stroking my clit. Again he pulled his fingers away, only to kiss me hard, and my legs began to tremble with afterburner intensity.</p> <p>"That was amazing," I said softly, my eyes still closed as I savored the afterglow of it.</p> <p>"It was," he said, his voice getting tired. "But I'm not done with you."</p> <p>"Don't tease me," I whispered. I reached down and pulled his shirt off before slipping my skirt down to the ground.</p> <p>His shirt caught on my dress, and for a moment I thought he was going to push it off of me, but he didn't. Instead his hands moved once again to my exposed breasts, touching them gently, and pulling on myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
