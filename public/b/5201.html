You had made me cum and now I had to ask you again.</p> <p>"No, just do not stop until I cum." You smiled and nodded. You began to slowly stroke my balls. The movement moved them around as you did so. I began my second orgasm of the evening. I could feel your fingers deep inside my cock. It was getting harder and harder to control my groans of pleasure. You stroked faster and harder. I could feel that the cum was growing. You kept your eyes locked on mine and did not turn my head away from my cock.</p> <p>After a little more than two minutes of ecstasy I grabbed my cock. It jumped in your hand. I felt the cum shoot out into your hand. The first stream hit your face and cheek, the next I aimed right at you. The rest of my load fell into the palm of your hand. I leaned forward and kissed you softly on the lips. Our tongues explored some of my jellied sperm and then we broke off. You turned your head away and swallowed the last remains of your meal. The taste was erotic as it filled your mouth. We kissed long and passionately, licking our tongues and swapping my cum in your mouth.</p> <p>My fingers had been massaging my cock. I brought the head to your wet lips. You opened your mouth and took it in, sucking and licking the sensitive head. Your hand began to stroke it gently. I leaned forward taking as much of your upper body into my arms as I could. Our love making was now more of an art form. My hands went to your breasts and I squeezed and fondled them, pinching and twisting each nipple. You began to suck my cock harder. I put my hands on your head rubbing your hair and pulling your mouth up and down my shaft. "I want you now!" I urged you on. You smiled and moved back onto the bed. I dropped off to the side and lay beside you. Our kissing had turned into full blown lust. My cock was still hard as a rock as I moved to you and began to caress both your breasts with one hand. The other hand was between your thighs and in between your legs. I pushed two fingers inside you, spreading your lips as much as possible. You parted your legs ever so slightly and I slipped two fingers inside you. You moaned into my mouth as I slipped two fingers in my mouth and began to lick your clit. "Do you want to eat me now?" you asked. "Oh yes! Please do do." I pulled my fingers from your pussy and gently pressed them inside you even more. Your hands gripped my hips and drove me to your mouth. Our tongues fought for supremacy. It turned me on to think I was eating my wife's pussy. I felt your tongue probing in and out of my pussy. You used your hand to part my lips with your finger and slid it inside me as deep as possible. Each time I would take a deep breath I would moan into your mouth. You continued to tongue my pussy as your fingers fucked me. Your hands, while still inside my mouth, found their way to the headboard. You began to use them to drive yourself even deeper into my mouth. Your hips rolled like a piston on the bed and your ass humped the air as you finger fucked me.</p> <p>"Oh God! OH YES!" you moaned over and over again. "God that feels good baby." I smiled and kissed you again. "Lay down on the bed baby." I turned over on my back and you sat next to me. You moved close to me and kissed my neck as your hands went to my cock. "It's my turn now!" I smiled and placed the head of my cock at the opening of your pussy. You moaned as my cock found the right spot. Your pussy muscles tightened a little more and the pressure on my cock heightened my pleasure. I had to stop my passion for as long as we could.</p> <p>Your pussy was still very tight and it took some doing to get my cockhead in but it worked. Your breathing was still ragged. You wrapped your arms around my neck and kissed me just as passionately. "Do you love fucking me now?" you asked. "Oh yes baby, I love fucking you, and I do love fucking you!" "Yes! I do!" Your whole body shook as you came. "I can't believe how good your cock felt inside me." I laughed and kissed your lips. "We have got to get back, I have a headache" and I jumped to my feet. We lay there for a while until we both realized that the time had come to return the favor. "No!" you said with a smile. "I need to get to the bathroom". Before I could say a word, you got up to the bathroom and began to relieve yourself. My cock continued to throb as the image of your beautiful bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
