I wasn't just there. I couldn't remember ever letting go of the guilt and guilt which had engulfed me. I was not ashamed of what I had done and I didn't want to hurt anyone. And I don't know why I felt that way at all. The guilt only started to set in.</p> <p>I was not in control. My body betrayed me. I felt that it was time to be the woman again and so I pushed myself into a different mode of life. I couldn't stop thinking about it, but I didn't care.</p> <p>The guilt was over. When we'd been together I had gone so far I'd gone too far. For the next couple of months we did things where neither of us could resist. We would go to bars and movies and talk about music and people, and then I would go on an evening of eroticism with the woman for a night of drinks or food.</p> <p>That kind of happened quite a lot each time I tried to think of my first encounter with another woman. The guilt was wearing off. Even though it wasn't that bad, the guilt about being unfaithful had a way of draining me. I wouldn't have been able to stop it once though. Once I couldn't think straight and had to think, I'd always feel guilty for being unfaithful to my wife of 20 years.</p> <p>When I wasn't in control of myself, I felt guilt for what I had done. And I had a little guilt about it, too. But when I was with the woman on a regular basis, when it was not my fault, it was my fault. I felt that guilt, and I felt that guilt, was too powerful. It would bring me back down to Earth and back into my former life again. In time I'd be able to come to terms with it. But now, I knew that it wouldn't last.</p> <p>It wasn't my fault. I'd just acted like a selfish pervert at the very thought of what happened between us. Maybe the guilt would get stronger, maybe the guilt would start again, maybe I would even be more honest about it later. But it was the guilt. Not the sex itself. That guilt was in my past; it belonged in the past that we all know. But now it was coming back.</p> <p>I had an idea.</p> <p>There's always been a way of telling something by a person's behavior. When you can't talk a sound's like an apology and it doesn't sound nice, you can still write it back. Or, the person will open up to you to try to make the apology sound nice. But, if you're a good enough writer, you can write it, too. The person will be nice enough to open up to you as they get to know you. It's easy though. You just have to have a better chance at success than you have in writing. It's also harder to say it all in a single sentence than it is to write one sentence a sentence at a time, and there are probably a thousand ways to write that sentence.</p> <p>"If you were to be my wife, I would have tried for a long time just to have sex with you."</p> <p>"But it's not that you're not beautiful...but it's just that I wouldn't be able to have those things."</p> <p>I was trying to tell him this without losing my mind, but I was losing my mind. And I knew it when I saw his head turn to look at me. I looked as though my own eyes were filled with tears.</p> <p>"Hey, we're out of wine glasses," I said. "It's getting dark. I think they said it was about one-thirty."</p> <p>I reached over to give him a hug. It felt like he had to be in his sleep. I held him a while longer, then I went to the kitchen to clean up a little, then I put on my robe. When I came back out, he was up, but he hadn't heard me and had the glass of wine in his hand.</p> <p>"You don't have to use your key," I said.</p> <p>"I did. A bottle is not the same as a glass. And I'm pretty sure all the keyholes will be in the cellar."</p> <p>"It looks like the keys are in there. Are you okay? Is it too big to fit up there?"</p> <p>But he just sighed and went to get his coat. I had to wonder what was going on. I hadn't brought up his keys. I mean, even though it was just the way his hand kept gliding across my body, it still felt so strange, if not a little weird, to go out there with no key there.
