A small gasp of delight escaped her as she ran her fingers through the length. His fingers were already slick and dripping from her juices, she brought her hand to wrap a fist around the firm cock and brought it to its full stiffness as much as to stroke him to the same degree. The head of his member was hot and hard as she stroked it, the wetness of her hand exciting him to the point of aching. She brought her hand to join his, her fingers to encircle his prick, her other hand running up and down his shaft.</p> <p>"Let's finish off this party, I need some cock in me," she told him, her fingers stroking faster as she pressed further into his body.</p> <p>He rose up on his feet and took her in his arms, leaning forward he kissed her for all his worth. Her long kiss sent chills through his body, all thoughts of foreplay gone as his throbbing organ met her lips. Kissing her he moved forward until he could feel the softness of her mouth. Her fingers were still wrapped round his cock, her fingers now stroking him faster. Suddenly she pulled away, her look full of hunger as she pulled back and opened the door.</p> <p>"I don't remember giving you permission to enter my house, don't make a big deal over it," she told him, grinning at him her hand still stroking his erection. "It's time to get back to the kitchen."</p> <p>He kissed her quickly, her lips wet and warm with desire. Then turning on the coffee he went to the open kitchen door and looked into the kitchen. Looking up at her it took him a moment to register what his vision was. He felt excited and ashamed as he watched her slowly and sensually undressing in front of him with nothing on but her blouse. She was in the process of removing her trousers, making the material fall between her legs and expose her black cotton panties. The sight of her naked body thrilled him, arousing him further, as it had aroused him earlier that night. Her legs were parted, displaying her shaven cunt, the lips glistening wet with passion, her arousal clearly visible. His mouth dropped open as he watched, he felt his cock twitch and jerked at the very air, his heart pounded and his blood raced. He couldn't believe it, he knew it, and he wanted to do it with her so badly. "I'm sorry," he started to say.</p> <p>She held his face in her hands and kissed him deeply. "Don't be. It didn't happen. Let's get this over with. Come back soon." She stood watching as he walked back to the couch.</p> <p>"You've been so lovely tonight. I couldn't resist," he said. A small smile crossed her lips at his compliments, making her feel even bolder.</p> <p>He handed her a glass of iced tea and she gratefully drank from the bottle. "I need to get out of these clothes and look at you. I can't stop touching you."</p> <p>"Would you like me to help you, make love to you?" she asked softly, her hand stroking his cock at her mouth and at the sight and feel of it.</p> <p>"That's the idea. Go have a look at yourself. I need something else for my bed." He took her hand and they walked silently to his bedroom and watched the last minute changes as she stripped out of her clothes. He looked at her body; her large breasts, her dark nipples hard as they strained against the thin cotton. Leaning forward he kissed her on her lips, his tongue flicking back and forth between them. Her hands slipped up and caressed his chest, feeling the muscles there. As they kissed she slid her right hand down his abdomen, past his belt. His heart raced as she stroked his cock through his boxer shorts. They kissed harder now, more passionately, his hands exploring her body, exploring her.</p> <p>Suddenly he pulled her down on his bed, pulling her gently to him. She lay flat on her back, his body hovering over hers, his face still locked in hers. His tongue darted out, dancing along her lips, probing inside her mouth. Her hands found the zipper of his boxers and with a few deft strokes they were out of their confines. Her fingers wrapped around his rigid penis, stroking him from base to tip on the upstroke. Their kiss never broke as he ran his hands up and down herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
