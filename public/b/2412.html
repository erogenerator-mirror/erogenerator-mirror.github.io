He smiled as I watched his hands move up and down on my body.</p> <p>"Yes, please." I moaned.</p> <p>He pulled his shirt off and he looked me over from head to foot. I had a small mole on my left thigh, it pointed towards a large pink nipple. He moved forward a little and undid my shorts, they were already off and he gently pushed me down onto the bed. I looked down at him and I'm almost ashamed by the size of his cock that looked almost as big as it did a few weeks ago. It looked bigger than before, it grew even bigger as he moved over me towards me.</p> <p>"Come and lick it." He whispered as he lay back.</p> <p>When his cock touched my lips, it touched me, I parted my lips and he slowly slid it in. I could barely open enough for him to enter me but he seemed to take his time as he moved up and down. He moved me gently but firmly, rubbing my clit as he did so. I moaned as he continued to fuck me. It lasted long enough to last for a short time, then he slid it out, I was so horny I needed it again right then. I reached for his cock and moved it towards my opening, I rubbed it along my lips as it got closer. I could barely wait for him and I slid myself onto my hands and knees, my pussy opening as my body opened. I got it and moved myself over its length and I felt it hit the end of my channel. He moved me over onto my back and got himself into position so he could move himself quickly to my mouth. I sucked in and out as he moved himself. He pushed himself into me, it was not enough, I was going to get used to it. I could feel the tip of his cock at the entrance to my pussy, he slowly pushed himself inside me and stopped. It hurt at first and I could feel him stretching me, but he continued, it was getting easier. He pulled me back towards him so he couldn't really go any further, it hurt but in a good way and he was loving it.</p> <p>"Do you like it." He said softly in my ear, then he pushed himself inside me as far as the bed would allow. The pain was still something I still longed for but I could tell. I felt him thrusting into me and I could feel his head touch something, then it happened again. I screamed as he pushed himself deeper into me than he had before. This time I wasn't sure if it was because it hurt or because I had missed the feeling inside me. I heard him groaning out each time he pressed himself into my body. He fucked me as he moved himself in and out, it was all I could do not to scream as the pain in my pussy overtook my body. I could feel him pressing himself onto my clit as he fucked me. The pressure on my clit was amazing and I screamed into the bed. I could feel both myself and the guy. We both felt, if I was correct, the other. I could feel the pressure of their bodies as they came together on the bed, they could come together and cum together. It was beautiful to think.</p> <p>The orgasms were strong. It lasted forever. The feelings were incredible. We were both breathing hard and sweating a little. I could feel myself getting tired, he held me as close as he possibly could, and he just lay there, both of them spent, me lying there as he kissed me and we fell asleep. When he awoke I was still there and we fell back to sleep both totally confused and unable to move. When he touched me, there was enough of the pain but also enough as wellâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
