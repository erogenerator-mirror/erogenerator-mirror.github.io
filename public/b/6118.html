I told her to stop if she wanted to. Slowly she backed the way back into the car, then put her arm around my waist.</p> <p>"Now what?" she asked.</p> <p>"You'll have to ask your husband." I told her.</p> <p>She pulled into the parking lot and parked. We said good night in some whispers, then she got out and we walked together to the house. I went into the back of the house and she turned down the hall. After our bedroom door was closed, she pushed me back against the wall and kissed me. My lips opened to hers, and my tongue found its way into her mouth. Our embrace was wild and passionate. She broke the kiss and we walked hand in hand to the bedroom. She threw herself on the bed as I shed my clothes. I was going to say something but she stopped me. Her breasts were heaving and she was breathing heavy. Her nipples were erect and I rubbed them lightly.</p> <p>I kissed those nipples before sucking one then the other. I went back to kissing her deeply, and gently stroking her breasts again. I sucked and licked each nipple, and she moaned. The heat from her vagina made me hard. She opened her legs and I pulled her to the edge of the bed. I climbed up and lay down between her legs. I pressed my rigid pole through the fly of my jeans. She reached down to feel it. I rubbed myself as she pushed herself down on me. She squeezed her breasts with her hands and rubbed my pole back and forth between her soft wet pussy lips. I pushed inside her slowly, but very carefully.</p> <p>"Oh God" she sighed. "You feel so good" she managed to say. "Fuck me!"</p> <p>I fucked her hard, my hands on her breasts. She pulled her hand away and slapped me. I moved off her and said, "Now it's my turn." She smiled, lay on her back then spread her legs wide. I moved back behind her and rubbed her breasts. As I touched them, she said, "Make me cum!"</p> <p>She didn't need much encouragement. I knelt between her legs and pushed inside. Her legs spread as my cock started to move inside her. I moved my cock in and out and she sighed at each insertion. Now I could feel my knob touch different parts of her body. It only took a few strokes before she started to buck. Her legs opened wider, and she started to moan as we fucked. Her moans turned into cries of passion as she climaxed as she orgasmed.</p> <p>She pushed my cock hard into her as her orgasm came, and pushed my cock into her as far as it would reach. I held it deep inside her and held her hands above her head as I came in orgasm. We rested for a moment after our orgasms and then she lay there, her legs open, her arms above her head with my cock still buried inside her. I lay there for a while as we talked about our lives, how we felt before, and how we were together. She didn't seem to mind. We were both lost in a world of passion. She moved and talked with me as we kissed, and our fingers explored and touched the others. We finished the evening at the dinner at a very intimate restaurant and afterwards came up to my hotel room, dressed for the occasion and went to bed.</p> <p>We fucked for the first week of summer, and then fell asleep together on Sunday evening. We kissed and I stroked her body as one then we fucked again that next night. We slept in the bed that night and went to sleep again in the darkness. The next morning we woke up in a different position and fucked in the kitchen as we finished breakfast.</p> <p>The next day we didn't see each other until breakfast, at the end of a week long hike we came back on the flat grass in front of the old building. There were piles of dirt and debris all around, but there was nobody to see us. I think that we both knew as we walked back to the car that we would not be seen again.</p> <p>After the week was over the two of us went home, and our son was in his room studying as he went to college. I kissed Karen at the door and walked back to my room to finish what I had started.</p> <p>Later on in the evening I watched my daughter's new boyfriends soccer team on TV but that ended with me in the kitchen again. Karen came over to me in her swimsuit. She gave me hugs and kisses and my face blushed.</p> <p>Karen then said, "I'm sorry for teasing you that morning but I would rather you didn't tease me."</p> <p>"Well, in that case I'm sure you won't tell anyone." I teasedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
