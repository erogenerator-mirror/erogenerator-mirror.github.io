I hesitated.</p> <p>"Honey," she began very cautiously, "it's still hard to find a single man in this town that hasn't... got a girlfriend."</p> <p>A tear rolled down my face as I remembered my sweet, innocent, daughter saying, "Oh, yeah, that's right. I'll never find one in this state," in a sort of sarcastic, "little-boy-goddamn-it" kind of voice. Then I was laughing it up.</p> <p>We finished up in the bedroom before getting out of bed for the first time. She gave me her sweetest face and a peck on the cheek and turned to go into the restroom. I saw that that she had pulled her panties on, but didn't put it on again...</p> <p>"Oh, I was right again," she said quietly.</p> <p>She left for the bathroom while I got the bed sheets in place.</p> <p>When I walked into the living room, she was laying on the bed, but she was staring at the window. I took her hand and held it, gently caressing the back of her head, then down onto her shoulder. She looked at me, smiled, and then kissed me. It felt so natural, and for just a moment, the guilt we'd shared with the old man, just before this time, flashed in my mind.</p> <p>She broke the kiss and looked at me. "Do you ever think about... uh... sex?"</p> <p>I smiled. "Of course."</p> <p>"No, no," she said, looking like she'd just had dessert. "No man or woman has ever... done... me so much... in my whole life," she said slowly.</p> <p>"It's true you're pretty and... and you have a beautiful face," I said softly.</p> <p>"Thank you, Daddy," she responded. She then kissed me gently again. I was very surprised that she would do that, since she had been so sweet the rest of those years I had been gone from her.</p> <p>"You do seem very young," she said. "When I saw you in this room, I got the idea that you were the young thing that I wanted to introduce you to... so I just..."</p> <p>"Yeah, you did," I replied.</p> <p>"And I didn't make a lot of money," she said, looking a little flustered. She was actually blushing, but she smiled brightly at me and put her hand back on the bed, this time holding it out to me. "I wanted to try it on you," she said, then blushed again, and went back to kissing me.</p> <p>I put my arm around her, pulled her on top of me, lifted my chin, and kissed her. My hands were on her back, pulling her down for me, all the while, stroking her back with a warm hand. Our love making lasted a long time, and I think we both just lost track of time until it was too late. I was coming, but she kept kissing me, pulling me up to her. "Mom, I'm sorry... I'm... I'm sorry," we both said at once.</p> <p>She kept kissing me, her warm hands running up and down my arms, then back to my arms, her breasts rubbing up against my chest as she did.</p> <p>After I had gotten the water going, I turned the shower on and put on a nice nightgown, putting on some sandals. We toweled off and then sat in the living room, me in my robe, and she sat in a t-shirt and a pair of panties. She took my hand and we held hands for a long time, talking quietly as we soaked the bathroom in the early morning light. When we finished, we got out the shower and washed each other off. It was very erotic to have the shower with the fresh, clean water filling the small room. Once she was cleaned, we took some toilet paper and wiped off the remains of our love making, then got dressed. We dried ourselves carefully, then we went back to the kitchen area of the home again.</p> <p>We had a bottle of wine in the refrigerator, and we had two glasses. I had one open while she turned on the lights in the den. After some more light, and more wine and more conversation, she handed me the glass and motioned me to sit in front of her, so she could watch and she could smell the cologne that we both liked. I did as she asked, and enjoyed the music that we had been listening for the past hour or so. We sipped our wine in the dark and relaxed each other.</p> <p>We kissed eachâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
