I felt like I had just been caught in the same act.</p> <p>When he relaxed, his penis slipped out from my body. He took it in his hand to clean it off. He smiled and said, "You're so beautiful," and turned off the table.</p> <p>We all sat down to dinner in the living room. I sat in the chair, but he sat on the floor in front of me. I smiled and looked to the other side of him. He was still naked. He looked over at me, smiled and said, "Now, what do you want to do next?" I looked up at him and nodded. He leaned to me, kissed me, grabbed my nipples between his teeth and pushed his tongue into my mouth. I sucked it back in. He moved a knee up on the couch. He pushed his knee between my legs, between my pussy. I was now ready for his cock. He slowly rubbed it up and down my slit and then pushed back inside of me. He held on to the back of my thigh as he rode me, holding each time he went in me.</p> <p>I moved my hand to his crotch. It was hard again, so I used it. My fingers began to slide up and down his shaft. I looked up at him. His eyes were closed as he held on to the back of my hand.</p> <p>I looked at my hand, now slick and wet with pre-cum, and began to stroke faster. I put my lips on the finger then and began to lick it.</p> <p>He looked up at me then and said, "That's good, you can have me. Your husband doesn't mind, does he?" He reached a finger in and scooped up the juice from my lip and put it back in his mouth. I smiled at him and said, "Yesssss."</p> <p>I looked up again and saw his face contort with pleasure. His eyes rolled back and I saw his hands squeeze my thighs hard. I continued holding onto his shoulder.</p> <p>His eyes closed. I could tell it felt good for him.</p> <p>I lifted my head up and looked down. His eyes were closed, but he was rubbing his finger against my clitoris.</p> <p>"Oh yes," I said. "Don't stop." He smiled at me.</p> <p>"How about giving me a little suck and a taste?" He asked.</p> <p>"I'd love that," I said. "Can I?"</p> <p>He looked into my eyes as his finger moved faster against my clitoris. I leaned to kiss him. He pulled away when I did. I looked down and smiled at him, licking my lips, before returning to caressing his cock.</p> <p>"Come on," he said. "Do it." So I moved my mouth lower and he lay back on the couch.</p> <p>I knelt down on the floor between his knees, still on all fours. I looked up at him. He was breathing heavily. My hand began to rub the head of his penis and I bent down to kiss it.</p> <p>His eyes opened and they glazed over so when he saw me, he closed them. He pulled the hair away from my face and looked at me with a smile.</p> <p>"Go on."</p> <p>I leaned back on my hands, and began very long licks at the head. Up and down. Up and down my tongue flicked against it.</p> <p>His groans became louder and longer. His hips were bucking. I took him in in to me, taking him to the back of my throat, my lips around him.</p> <p>"Oh fuck me." He whispered. "You're so good at this."</p> <p>My fingers found his balls and worked them as I sucked him in my mouth and moved my hand up and down his shaft faster.</p> <p>"Cum for me. Oh...oh...oh...OH!" It came. Spurt after spurt came in to my mouth. I sucked for a few moments as I swallowed the sweet spunk off myself. I smiled at him. "You're so good for me baby."</p> <p>Suddenly he lifted his hips. It was too much for me. I sat up on my knees and grabbed his penis. The head looked like the head. I bent my head down and kissed it.</p> <p>"What's wrong, babe?" He asked.</p> <p>I looked at his head. It was wet. I smiled as I placed it on his lips. "You make me so wet."</p> <p>He put his hand on my head and pulled me to him. He kissed me with his tongue, while continuing to pumpâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
