If that was what a man needed, she had to admit that she was interested. She blushed crimson under his gaze, as she always did, before he got up and walked out the door, not just to find his wife in her home but for some mysterious, possibly dangerous, adventure.</p> <p>He had seemed to read her thought, and before she knew it, the door had closed and she was in the kitchen with her back to him, her back against the cabinets as she listened to a song that had been playing the day before. She could feel him looking at her as he ate and she could even feel his arousal, she was not exactly sure if it was her skin against his or his body against hers, she didn't care, but for some reason she felt attracted to him. He had never been the kind of man that would kiss her, much less take her home after they had finished the work. He might have gone home to his wife or mother, but she was the one that would have gotten up the first time he did so.</p> <p>There was her best friend Mary, and if a kiss was enough to get even a woman wet, why the hell would he do it again? For what reason, for her, or her? She should have seen it coming, she didn't have to explain, he had been so rough, so passionate. She wondered if he would ever feel the same way, but of course that would be too late. She needed to figure out if he still thought of her as "his" girl, or just was he being weird by being so...so..."</p> <p>Her body was on fire and he was already doing something he hadn't done in months, and she wasn't sure she could take much more without a fight. She decided she might as well go on the offensive. "Hey, what's wrong, why is your phone off?"</p> <p>His answer was a quick, and then without warning, "Is my wife on the line?" she asked as she got up and walked around the kitchen, taking the phone from him with a quick look. "Is she back at work?"</p> <p>"Nope, Mary just asked me 'where is he', I guess she was out with friends." She took the phone back from him, and put her hands over its ear and hit the button. "Hello?? Mary? I'm sorry for calling, but I'm really fucking horny. I would like for you to join me for dinner tonight, it's really not a big problem, but I'm running late. Where the fuck are you?" she said as she put the phone on the table and walked out, pausing to kiss the one person in the house that could possibly be as excited as she was and still be in it for so long. "Don't worry about it. I can handle it, I'm not that old for your tastes, I'm sure you can handle yourself." she said as he hung up the phone and reached down to grab his pants. "No peeking! Take some time to get yourself off and make up your mind, please? Oh, by the way, you forgot to mention that you had to leave early so you didn't have a good time. I wouldn't want to spoil anything. Don't worry, I have a wonderful time for you, really I do."</p> <p>She picked up the phone and said, "You are very welcome. I don't know if it will bother you to hear about the sex life I've just had, I think Mary already told me that I am in love with you."</p> <p>His answer was, "No, of course not. Not really, in fact you don't know it, she is my best friend. If you want to know, just ask for me, and I'll tell you everything you need to know." He said as he handed her the phone and he sat down as she sat back and pulled him down on the couch. He wrapped his arms around her and held her close so that she wouldn't feel strange.</p> <p>"I've never really kissed a man before," she said as she slowly stroked his chest. "I'm a little shy, but if you want I'll tell you everything," she said as she moved to kiss him. "But I don't think you'll be in the mood to wait and get there, you're not too old are you?" she asked as she felt him move to his side, so she could take his shirt off too.</p> <p>"Oh no, you're not too old. You have a body you will have proud to show off," he said as he pulled her into him, as he felt her breath against his neck and ear. As she rubbed her face against his neck, his hands ran the full length of her back and shoulders as he pulledâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
