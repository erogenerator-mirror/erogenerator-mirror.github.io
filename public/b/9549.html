She lifted her hips when their touch met and he slid one finger into her. She moaned as she felt him. He pushed his fingers in and out of her with a slow steady rhythm. He pulled his wet fingers out and pressed them to his lips so that he could taste her.</p> <p>“Yes,” she whispered. “Please make me come.”</p> <p>He pressed his fingers hard into her making her feel the wetness increase, his mouth open and panting as she held on tighter to his hand. He pressed two fingers into her and he began licking her as they rubbed together in rhythm of their fingers. He sucked her tongue, her jaw, her chin, and finally on her nipple as she came into his mouth with an explosion. He squeezed her nipple, then pulled his hand to her ear, running my fingers through his beard as he sucked her nipple. He moved lower and pressed his chest against her thighs as he entered his fingers again into her. He slid in and out of her as she bucked against his hand and moaned in ecstasy. After she came again, he leaned forward resting his hands against her naked thighs and looking into her eyes with passion and love.</p> <p>“I love you,” he whispered.</p> <p>“I love you too,” was all she could reply.</p> <p>He pulled his fingers out of her. They lay together for a few moments, then he began to stroke her face and lips with both of his hands. The kisses were soft and loving, and their eyes met. His hand moved to her lips feeling their wetness with the tip of his finger. His finger slid into her until he had met no resistance and he slid all the way all the way out until the tip was completely covered. He slid both of his fingers slowly and watched her facial expression as he did this. She was still panting and looking at him through closed eyes with a hunger in the way that he was looking at her that she wanted his body all of it and her. They didn’t speak, they simply touched and caressed as they looked deeply into each other’s eyes. He slid his fingers back into his mouth and sucked on them, tasting her and loving her. He slid them back into her again and he slid them out again.</p> <p>He sat up as his eyes met hers, and he pushed her legs apart with his knee. He bent his knee and slid all the way between her legs and up her body until his fingers rested against her neck. He reached between her legs and ran them up her body, touching her as he did so, and rubbing his fingers between her lips as his lips kissed hers. She ran her hands down his arms to his waist, and back down his body. She wrapped her hands around his body and caressed him and made herself feel as much of his body as she could touch. She looked up into his eyes and he smiled and kissed her.</p> <p>“You are mine,” she whispered as he broke from their kiss. With that comment, he slid his finger up her body and inside her again, while he kissed her and played with her pussy. He slid three fingers into her a little at a time as he kissed her with his hand and played with her with his tongue. She was moaning as she came. Once he was convinced that she had come, he looked up and kissed her once more, his fingers still moving inside her and she kissed him back. He slid his fingers deeper and then pulled them out, and he watched her face as the pleasure spread over, from her neck, down to her breasts, between her legs. She felt her stomach tighten when he kissed her, then her lips.</p> <p>“Lie down on the bed,” he said before lying beside her and kissing her tenderly.</p> <p>“You taste as soft as honey,” he whispered as he caressed her face and shoulders.</p> <p>She looked into his eyes and smiled. Then she saw something on her nightstand, with a bottle of vodka sitting there. She opened it and took her first sip from the bottle.</p> <p>He slid on top of her, pinning her as his lips kissed her neck and ears. Then he kissed her face. His free hand ran up her thigh on the inside as he nibbled and kissed her ear and neck. She leaned her head back into his grasp, and felt so wanted and so vulnerable on her back. She felt so safe, so loved, and so desired lying naked beside him, his arms around her, his hand resting on her breast, his fingers playing with her nipple.</p> <p>“Let’s get comfortable,” he whispered with a grin.</p> <p>“Let’s get over here,” she said breathlessly as she felt the wetness building down there again.
