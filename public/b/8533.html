I got a hold of him to let him know what I would do then gave him a little wink to get him going. I knew what to do and used a little of what little I own to get my hair out."</p> <p>"Who would do that?" I whispered.</p> <p>"Oh, we used to," he said softly. "My Mom started me on the same path. She used to go down and look at my hair when she got me in bed with my father."</p> <p>He put his hand in my hair and pulled my face up to meet his. He was still breathing slow and steady. "How did you feel about your dad? I mean it made me even more excited."</p> <p>"Yeah, I knew. We were on our way to have a couple of beers," he said with a wink. "I really can't do much myself so we went to sleep. The next thing I knew I was back with my dad. He was still asleep on the couch. But this time I got to go with him. He wanted me to dance with him so I took my clothes off and gave him a little dance. His eyes got wide as he sat on the edge of the bed. He went on the dance floor with me but when he saw Mom and I on the dance floor with him he just ran out. It's not unusual to hear them talking. When he found out he would have to leave the club. He was embarrassed at the thought of having a man in a club without a wife at home. But I couldn't wait any longer. So I told him I would dance with him."</p> <p>I watched the look of hurt leave his face as his hand went to the zipper on my skirt. "I asked him what his story was. He told me he never had a chance like Dad did."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," he whispered.</p> <p>"I know," I said. "And he said as fast as he could. Maybe it was just a reflex. I didn't want him to feel like a real man. It didn't seem very good."</p> <p>He looked at me and I saw him starting to tear up. "He did this for you?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>I nodded. "He didn't have a chance. Dad didn't like doing it though."</p> <p>"I know. I was too old. My sister had cancer and didn't want to do it. So he was always the worst. He wanted to do it to me and to someone else, then do it to the other."</p> <p>"Didn't happen. Dad was always at home. Like when you went to the doctor or one of your old high schools. You know what it is like to go there. All the men and women like to go there," I said with a smile. "That's why I came back. I just had to."</p> <p>"I know," he said. "I got a little drunk a time or two too. And then things sort of fell apart. I had to find out about this new kind of man. What we were going to do. It would make it easier to take care of you. I also thought you might want to meet a new man for that."</p> <p>So it was his fantasy. But that's all it was. He didn't do it. That was all it was. And then he took the next step. He took the next step with me.</p> <p>"So does that have anything...um...wrong about it?" I asked.</p> <p>"Well, of course," he said. "What we didn't do. We never got our turn."</p> <p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p> <p>"I mean, I've never had a woman come on to me before," he said. It was almost like he was a virgin again. But he said he didn't regret doing it. "I can't say I loved it as much as I probably should. I was drunk at the time, but after a night like this was like no more than having a nice slow lover."</p> <p>"Does it hurt?" I asked.</p> <p>"I guess you can say there could be some, um, other things we don't know. That kind of thing. But I don't think we could live with ourselves if what we wanted was to be wrong."</p> <p>"Oh. That's sad," I whispered and he smiled and kissed my temple. "What is it he really wants to do?"</p> <p>"I don't know," he said. "It's sort of my dad story. Maybe he wants to turn into a real man."</p> <p>"Yeah.
