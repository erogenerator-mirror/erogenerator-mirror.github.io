She looked over at me.</p> <p>"That was the boss. I have been thinking about it all day, ever since I got here"</p> <p>"Ohhhh! I guess we should get a room." I reached over and put my arm around Mandy. She squeezed me.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Mandy, I have been thinking about it all day and I have been thinking about tonight too." She kissed me.</p> <p>"Mmm, we have a lot of time if we don't get some food in here and we need to get back. I don't want to get any hungry."</p> <p>"Mmm, you should see my stomach. Don't expect nothing tonight."</p> <p>"I know you don't want to eat, but maybe once we get a few things accomplished, we can talk. Maybe we will get some action later on, in the kitchen."</p> <p>"Well, I guess we will have about forty-five minutes before it really starts. Now lets get the food inside." Mandy took my hand and we headed back into the kitchen.</p> <p>The doorbell rang, the lights were flashing and the restaurant were pretty quiet.</p> <p>"Well, do you want some food and food here?" I asked.</p> <p>"Do it, honey." Mandy grabbed my hand and led me into the kitchen. When I entered her kitchen, her back was to me. She turned and I could see a glimpse of her breasts and the cleavage of her ass.</p> <p>"I love it when you stare but it has to be a very special treat for me, honey."</p> <p>"Ok, fine, how about you get a salad, cheese, a couple hamburgers if that is ok?" I followed Mandy back into the kitchen.</p> <p>"Mmm, I'll get us some salad." She put the salad onto the stove, opened up two glasses and poured some water in them. She filled the wine glasses in the cabinet, turned the dial on the stereo, started a fire in the sink and fixed the cheese and salad.</p> <p>"You don't have to get that though. I could just wear the panties and bra though" I said. She giggled.</p> <p>"Come on, you have to get naked for me, honey. I've seen a little."</p> <p>"Ok, I can change." Mandy took a bottle of wine and a large plastic bag. She opened the bag to find one of the sex toys.</p> <p>"Oh my! Are you really serious?"</p> <p>"Yes, you can wear the panties and bra right now" I pulled my shirt off and started undoing my pants. Mandy was in the meantime, unbuttoning her shorts, "Why don't we go over to the table, sit down and I'll finish the salad and put the veggies in the salad."</p> <p>Mandy did as requested and I took several bite after bite of salad and cheese. I had put some salad in the fridge with the water and I poured us two large, smooth, thick, cold sours. I grabbed a large plate and set it on the table.</p> <p>"Come over here with me." Mandy walked with me towards the table. I sat the plate in front of her and told her to move around in front of me. She moved to stand in front of me. For the first time since I came home, I put my hand in front of me. I placed her hand on mine, I pulled the hand and we stood for a few moments together. We smiled at each other.</p> <p>Mandy had a wonderful smile and she turned and looked at me and said, "You look good tonight." She blushed a little and gave a little giggle.</p> <p>"Well, you look good yourself Mandy." I just held her hand a little longer than necessary, she blushed again and looked down and started to stand.</p> <p>"Just give me five or six seconds." I put my hand on her shoulder and she put her hand on mine again.</p> <p>"It was great meeting you, Mandy." Mandy just smiled and leaned over the table at me.</p> <p>There was a long pregnant pause. I got up and said, "Please get back in the chair." Mandy slowly walked back to her chair, then back to me.</p> <p>After a minute I sat back down. "I'm just going to finish up this food" I walked back into the kitchen, brought the salad, cheese and a large bag of chips. "How do you want the sandwiches to be?" I put one in front and the other in back, "Here, put them in the saladbox, we can eat them later."</p> <p>Mandy quickly picked up a sandwich and sat on the table. "Can I get two beers?" I sat and took mine out.
