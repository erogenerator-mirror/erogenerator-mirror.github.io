Nothing about you. I love you, and everything's fine." He couldn't bring himself to mention her name in that way, even if he had known his friend would say that.</p> <p>She took his hand: "It's been just the right thing to say, honey. Thank you for all the compliments, and there was no need; you're a terrific guy." Before either of them moved, he took her back by the hand, and the two of them led the way back to the car.</p> <p>"What about me?" she asked as they got back; he was looking back, not looking at the road, and neither of them seemed to know. "Well? What about me?"</p> <p>"There's no reason we have to have a long discussion."</p> <p>She smiled, and shook her head.</p> <p>"I don't think so."</p> <p>"Well, I'd like you to know," he began, "there was no need to talk about your boyfriend. We could do this again, and I promise to show you how wonderful we are together."</p> <p>"I don't know if we can..." she was about to say something, when she saw the hurt in his eyes. "Oh no," she added hastily, "I'm just...so sorry - but I'm just really horny, and it's been a while."</p> <p>"No, it's not that; I just thought it would be better for both of us if we were alone. I didn't mean to push you, when I was looking for a boyfriend - I can't imagine anyone doing that."</p> <p>"You're right," she said with a smile, and he got so nervous he blushed. "This is a nice place. I just wanted some privacy."</p> <p>"You might want a lot of privacy," he said, and she blushed again. "But if you've got a hard-on, I'm sure the bed will fit you, then."</p> <p>"And just where do you plan to put it?" she whispered, and he smiled.</p> <p>"I'm thinking my hand will probably get cold." He said.</p> <p>She gave him a grin and whispered: "The bed will probably fit you as well. I don't see what I can afford to buy it."</p> <p>"That's very thoughtful." He smiled.</p> <p>"Can I ask permission to kiss it," she said, and he nodded: "Come on."</p> <p>"I'm not sure if I can kiss your hand or your feet," he said. "I can't think of any way."</p> <p>He walked on.</p> <p>"Do you know what you want," she asked, as he kissed her palm.</p> <p>"I don't really," he said, smiling, and she leaned him back.</p> <p>"Come closer," she said, and he got up. He held her hand, as he moved into her arms.</p> <p>"I'll kiss my lips," she whispered. He looked away, and she reached up and put her hand lightly on his cheek - the kind he was so shy, and he looked away without saying anything.</p> <p>"You can kiss me," she said, and he kissed her soft lips, parting them slightly with his tongue. They started kissing again, and she started moving her mouth over his, as he felt his tongue exploring the tip of hers. His hand was holding hers and hers was on his cheek, and both hands were around his face and neck, as if they were holding on to something for him to hold onto.</p> <p>She felt his hand on her bottom, and found herself trying to pull it away... he was pulling it closer to her, and she looked down, to see what he was doing. His hand was inside one of her jeans, slowly rubbing her inner thigh, and she couldn't help but moan as she felt it.</p> <p>"I've been dying to touch you," he whispered, and she thought she heard himself moaning into her mouth. "Please, please touch me," she whispered, and her own hand was running over the top of him.</p> <p>"You can't be wearing any panties," he whispered, and they both blushed. "Or did you?" he asked before she could answer.</p> <p>"It's not the kind of thing I normally wear..." she smiled, and he nodded: "If you don't wear panties, I wouldn't be feeling much."</p> <p>"But we shouldn't be doing this," he said.</p> <p>"Of course we shouldn't, so how can we stop?"</p> <p>"I want this," she reached downâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
