I don't want to get you pregnant. I'm not trying to get you pregnant again," in a softer voice. She held her hands and said, "Just enjoy being with me. I like the same way that I like you. If you want to be a Daddy someday, that's fine with me. I'll call you tomorrow to set up some meetings and talk about it."</p> <p>John thought about what she had just said for a moment until he saw it and said, "Why don't we make breakfast? I'll call my cell phone and see if it works to call the doctor right before breakfast to get me checked for STDs."</p> <p>They ate breakfast silently. The other two girls got up and started gathering their gear and headed toward work.</p> <p>"We've just got to finish up with a couple of my clothes because we need to go see some of the cars," Megan said.</p> <p>"OK, Megan, I'll call my cell to make sure it works. I'll call you later. Bye."</p> <p>Maggie stood there for a couple of moments looking at John. He had his hand on her shoulder and then she said, "Oh, honey. You've really just said your goodbyes. It was nice not to have to drive every weekend. I'm in love with you."</p> <p>He lifted her chin with his hand, and she kissed him gently. He kissed her on the top of her head and said, "I love you too, sweetheart. You know that, right?"</p> <p>He held her face in his hands, and she leaned into him and said, "Oh, yeah, John. I know."</p> <p>That night, John couldn't sleep. As he lay on his side, he saw the alarm clock on his nightstand and saw that it was 3:00 AM. He looked at his cell phone and saw that it had been asleep for 3:10 AM. He got up, got his coffee, and went into the bathroom and started the shower.</p> <p>In a very real moment, John could feel that Maggie's mood was changing. He wasn't sure whether it was just the anger that seemed to emanate from her mood because she was furious and hurt for him or because she was upset with him because he was a daddy.</p> <p>He finished his shower, dried off, and made sure to shave every bit of stubble from his face, his neck and chest. He got in his robe and laid down on his bed to wait for Maggie to wake up.</p> <p>Half an hour later, John's phone rang. He picked it up and saw it was Maggie. "Good morning, sleepy head," she said. "Are you still in bed?"</p> <p>"Yeah," he said. "How was last night?"</p> <p>She said, "Same. I have not slept at all. We have had sex, right?"</p> <p>"Yeah ... yes, we have. We have done more than one." She turned to him and said, "How did it feel, sweetheart. You fucked my daughter and all her friends at the same time, didn't you?"</p> <p>They talked another hour before Maggie started to respond. "No, darling. We are not having sex. The only time we are having sex is when we are in the mood and I really enjoyed it. But just a quick second or two before we start to do what we both love so much, that it is not good to get carried away and do something you think is going to hurt you," she said.</p> <p>John tried to hold her at the same time he took a quick look into her eyes and said, "You are not right!"</p> <p>"Honey. I love everything we have done and have done for each other. It doesn't feel right to hurt you, do you understand?"</p> <p>He was afraid to say it to her, but they knew one thing: whatever hurt her, it hurt her.</p> <p>"I appreciate you showing me just a little more love. You are loving me now. If there is any doubt, just leave it away. We are lovers now. If it ever gets to that stage, you know I won't leave you."</p> <p>John's feelings for the beautiful girl that he had fantasized over all week were growing by the minute. She was the best he had ever been with. Even if Maggie wanted it rough just once, she would not force it. Maggie and John had a solid relationship and really didn't take that any other way.</p> <p>He went to their bedroom and took out some clothes and brought them to their door. He left them on the bed and went to his side of the bed. He noticed that Maggie was still asleep. He went down and picked up her and carried her into the kitchen where they ate breakfast.</p> <p>He helped her with the dishes and he took outâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
