I kept quiet, but I kept rubbing my pussy and my clit while I watched. Then, out of nowhere, I came.</p> <p>The next day, I heard her on the phone. She was calling me again, but this time she did it from her home.</p> <p>I couldn't believe it. She was calling me again, right at my desk. I opened the phone and looked up at her. She was blushing and her cheeks were flushed. I told her what I'd witnessed yesterday, and she said she'd been shocked by it, that it had to be the biggest thing she'd experienced in years. She seemed to have a little laugh and apologized, telling me that the phone calls were mostly out of fear of being caught in a public place without any clothes on. Then she got a smile.</p> <p>"I don't believe it," she said. "I think I'm just gonna go to my room and take a nap. I don't even know who you are right now."</p> <p>I told her who she was seeing. I told her that she must be one of my students, and that I'd be able to stop her if she called me the next day. She replied that she would stop me if I really wanted it, but what would she do if it was in person?</p> <p>As I was getting ready to call her, she walked in front of me. She was naked, and her skin had some marks on it. She grabbed my crotch from behind and squeezed my balls. I could feel that I was about to have sex with her. We broke the phone and left each other's space. We didn't even talk to each other any more. She walked back to her room.</p> <p>I went in her room as soon as I could. I'd already showered and changed into something more decent. My pussy was still dripping. I pulled out my clothes and walked in front of her mirror.</p> <p>She saw me, and she stared at my breasts with a kind of awe. I smiled at her. Then I pulled my shirt off over my head. I walked around to the front so she could see my naked body, and I told her to get down on hands and knees. I told her where she had been and I didn't know who she was. We were now both naked. She was breathing hard as she looked at me. She started to kiss my breasts. I looked down and saw my nipples erect. I reached into her panties and she got the message. She was soaking wet.</p> <p>I guided her onto her back and slid my hard rod into her. I began to move very slowly. We looked at each other, then, into the mirror and I saw her smile. I stopped moving and slowly pulled out, then slid inside again. She closed her eyes. I stopped moving and waited for her to tell me to stop. She opened her eyes and looked into the mirror.</p> <p>"What are you going to do?" I asked. Her face was screwed up.</p> <p>"Wait here," she replied.</p> <p>We waited in the bedroom until my cock was hard, then we got in her bed and we fucked one more time. It was intense. She seemed to be a little pissed because she was the one that had been fucking with the phone. And that was when I saw her face start to go red. She was embarrassed to have me see her like that.</p> <p>We fucked many more times before she stopped feeling angry about anything, and she just got pissed down to her cock.</p> <p>She stopped feeling upset, but I started to worry. She was beginning to panic. She took a shower and I got her to put on a corset so it could be see up. The corset had a very sexy back and was made in the right size. It seemed to me that the bra could just be rolled up.</p> <p>My stomach was beginning to hurt and my nipples were hard as steel. When I had a good amount of cum in me and it was ready to spill out, I went back up to my room and got dressed. I knew I would be fucking with someone else tomorrow. I could tell she was nervous, but I didn't give her that.</p> <p>I went back down to my room and she got her clothes, and took a shower, and I went upstairs to do the same. I just felt I was putting my life on the line, but the fact was that it was me, not her.</p> <p>I had no idea how she was feeling, or what to do.</p> <p>It really wasn't that big of a deal. There was no point in trying to make things work; I just knew I would have to put up with her for a while longer. Even though we were making love, sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
