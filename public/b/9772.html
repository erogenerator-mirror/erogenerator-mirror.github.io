I look around the bar and realize that I haven’t had a drink in over an hour. My mind races to figure out what exactly I’ve got that I haven’t had before. Then I remember all the sex toys and bondage gear I’ve seen online, and get madly aroused. “I’ve got what?” A small part of my brain tells my stomach to move. There’s no one in the room, so maybe the door isn’t even closed. I’m in trouble.</p> <p>“It’s okay…I have the vibrator.” You whisper your hand on my arm again and pull me to a dark corner on the dance floor. Your voice isn’t as smooth as yours, but it isn’t cold either. With a slight smile, I take my glass of bourbon and set it down in front of me.</p> <p>I smile again and lift my glass to kiss you. You press your tongue into my mouth and take a drink of bourbon from your glass. Your hands slide up my thighs and over my stomach, pulling my shirt up slowly. “I like this,” you tell me. “Why don’t you go up to a little room on the top floor, and take off your clothes.” My jaw drops at your suggestion but you keep it in the right position. Your arms are around me again as your mouth presses against my cheek and I can smell your cologne.</p> <p>My hand comes behind my back and unhooks my bra slowly, letting you feel my curves through my shirt. Your lips leave mine and you pull my shirt across my chest. Your mouth descends to my belly-button, teasing it with your tongue. Your hands come up to cup my breasts and I moan softly. Your mouth comes down my stomach to the tops of my thighs. I feel your breath against my thighs and imagine it’s you’re licking the outside of my pussy, which sends shivers of pleasure through me.</p> <p>Your hands run up my thighs and run over my ass, before gently gripping and separating my cheeks. I can feel your hand on my ass as you pull me forward gently. You press my thighs apart and run your hand along my moist pussy. I can feel your breath in against my pussy as you push a finger inside me. I can’t move; I’m tied up.</p> <p>Your hand finds my clit and you gently stroked it before moving away.</p> <p>“Lie down on the bed with your head on the pillow.” your throat is deep and I can’t catch my breath. “Open your mouth and keep it open.” I open my mouth and see you holding a bottle. I lick the top of the bottle, tasting my own juices on your finger.</p> <p>In the middle of the bed you spread my thighs, and a few moments later, I feel your cock push my pussy lips open. I’m surprised by the feel. You push the head of your hard cock into my pussy. I can feel your weight as you push further inside me.</p> <p>“God, yes.” I breathe, as you start to fuck me. I can feel my pussy open and you pull out. Your cock pushes into me again, and I get sooo wet. I wrap my legs around you. My hand finds your balls and I caress them gently. You pull my tits out of the bra and roll each nipple roughly between my forefinger and thumb, as if they would do something else more pleasurable with them. My other hand finds the vibrator and I start to turn it on. Your hands press me against the bed as you fuck me in earnest.</p> <p>I am lost in the sensations that your cock can’t satisfy. The feeling of my pussy being stretched is too intense in this position. Finally I feel your body tense, and my pussy walls contract around you as you thrust deeply inside me, one last hard stroke. “It’s all yours,” you gasp, as your cock explodes inside me. You pull my legs up and away from you completely, your weight holds me against the head of the bed with the intensity of your orgasm. All the air leaves your lungs in your passion. You kiss me again.</p> <p>“I’m sorry,” you say with a smile.</p> <p>“I’m not sorry.” I say, as I turn to kiss you. “This was a first—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
