"And just what are you wearing?"</p> <p>"What?" she asked.</p> <p>"The same thing as yours," I said. "What you look comfortable in," I slid a hand up her thigh and she gasped.</p> <p>"You're wearing the same thing," she said, then realized what I meant when she said 'same thing as you'.</p> <p>"And what have you been wearing under that outfit," I asked.</p> <p>"Nothing," she admitted.</p> <p>"Hmm," I said, thinking she meant nothing. "Now you're wearing my new outfit -- the one with the big 'S' on it that's going all over. Your bra and panties are different -- the way that's been designed by the designers but the way they looked when we first got here. And it looks ... wow."</p> <p>"Well, that's kind of like what you've put on," she said.</p> <p>"Yes," I agreed. "I just love it."</p> <p>We got up, and I pulled the top off her with a wet finger, then peeled the pants down her legs and off her legs.</p> <p>Before I stripped her, she had slid down next to me on the sofa and was watching me while I watched her. We didn't talk, just stared. I slid down and kissed her, and she did the same with me, wrapping her arms and legs around me. I was looking down at her, and when she looked up at me, I had my mouth on hers. I felt her kiss me there, and this time when I opened my mouth I had a very different set of lips on mine.</p> <p>It wasn't about the taste, just how it felt, and the fact that it might not actually get there if I hadn't wanted it.</p> <p>And then our lips just did it.</p> <p>"Oh," was all Janice could say as her mouth opened and my tongue shot in and out of hers, flicking her clit and probing it deeper inside and sliding all around. It was unlike anything I'd ever felt, and despite the fact she was my wife, I felt I was responding to her. Her reaction was like nothing she'd ever experienced.</p> <p>I kissed her all the way through her kisses, and when I stopped and looked at those little breasts that were hanging so pendulously from her chest, I saw that she was looking at me with a bit of a bemused look on her face. And a lot of it was because she was looking at me -- and for the first time in her life, she had the nerve to say "Hi" to me!</p> <p>What had she said to her? "Hi."</p> <p>"Hi," I whispered back at her. "I'm glad I could help."</p> <p>After all that had happened, I can't count that this was the only time I'd come across her like this, and I had no idea how to deal with something like this.</p> <p>"Yeah," I agreed. "That's the way it's supposed to work." I rolled the two of us on top of me and then got my arms around her and pulled her against me.</p> <p>She must have felt the same way, because she melted into me instantly.</p> <p>She was so soft and wonderful in my arms and the same kind of warmth in my chest.</p> <p>We didn't kiss that way for a long time, just enjoyed the feel of each other. It was good to have her at arm's length instead of with her head on my shoulder, facing me instead of between me and the sofa while we were both in a kind of daze.</p> <p>After we caught our breath, we lay on the back of the sofa. It was only our second time that we were like this, and I was so relaxed that I didn't feel right doing anything at all of the time. But neither of us were going to complain. When I started to move, I wasn't sure I wanted to.</p> <p>"C'mon," I said when I felt her move a little. "Let's do again."</p> <p>"Sure," she agreed, and sat up on the sofa as she was getting out of mine. "Come on."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Come on," she said, then looked at me as she slid back against me so that I was on my back.</p> <p>I watched her move over toward the sofa and then feel her body on top of mine.</p> <p>"I'd like to do the same thing," she said. "That's my favorite way on that sofa -- not that I've tried it before."</p> <p>"Well," I answered. "It is."</p> <p>She began to slowly rise and drop herself on me.</p> <p>"You know," I said, taking a sip from my wine glassâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
