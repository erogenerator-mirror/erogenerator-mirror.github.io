I said softly.</p> <p>"No-don't go..." She said with a slight hiccupped tone in her voice, "I just got really horny. I need to get home and I need you to take care of my dick."</p> <p>"Alright, babygirl, just call me."</p> <p>"Ohh, do I ever...I mean, why is that so important," she said with slight disappointment but a grin, "I know you mean well, baby."</p> <p>With that, I quickly rose and left her in peace for the long ride home.</p> <p>She was right, after all. But, I was still unsure how I felt about me. It didn't really feel like love, it had more of lust with which to ease. The feeling of lust, the passion and the need had been there when we started, but it had mostly passed. I had never been this horny or this drunk, when I looked at her with those kinds of feelings, she had always felt very good. Now though, the feeling of attraction and arousal were coming to the surface, and I was finding it harder to think when those feelings flowed from me. I didn't know why, but I just wanted to be with her. I also wanted to be with a woman. A woman who'd be mine. A woman who I could show her how I felt about her and make love to her and show my love and respect for her. Not just anything sexual, but love.</p> <p>It had been so long and the feelings hadn't been there yet, but there was a level of intimacy between us, a feeling I didn't really know how to show, but for the most part I had. I wasn't sure of when it would hit me, but right now I wanted to be with her.</p> <p>"Oh, baby." I said softly, pulling her face closer to mine.</p> <p>Her mouth was still open in surprise, "Oh, honey, you're so big...You fill me so big, baby. God...I need you to fuck me..." she said softly.</p> <p>"You're so young..." I said, moving closer, "I've been with a lot of boys and their big, thick cocks. They're never this big, though, and sometimes they come a little bigger, and others they come a little shorter..."</p> <p>"They fuck like animals!" She said with a laugh.</p> <p>"They're always so, like, in charge...I'm almost never in them, and I'm usually left hanging." I admitted.</p> <p>"I don't think, so, I'm probably going to be a lot of things to fuck tonight. I think, that in most things that's how you take all your big, sexy friends. That's how they make love to you." I said, "But right now, that's nothing. But as they take you, as they feel down on your huge cock, that's how you become real big...the way they make love to you..."</p> <p>"You don't," she said softly, sounding relieved, "you haven't?" She added as a light bulb went off in my head.</p> <p>"Honey, look...I'm going to fuck you and make you happy tonight." I said, my voice getting closer.</p> <p>She nodded her understanding, looked down and saw my cock through my zipper, and reached out her hands with a soft, warm glee, "Ohhh!" she said softly. Her eyes were on fire with sexual energy radiating from her fingertips.</p> <p>"Oh, god, I want you so bad," I said, my voice full of lust, "I've been dreaming of you all this time, thinking about you."</p> <p>"Don't say you can't," she said, with a soft smile. Her hands moved from my cock and she felt me hardening. "What do you think it is? Is that big or not?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't know. I've never taken anything like your monster." I responded, my voice filled with lust.</p> <p>Her touch and words and even her face seemed to be telling me differently, telling me I was very big. I thought I might faint, as I watched her eyes moving down my body as she took in the way my cock was now straining against my jeans. We were both breathing heavily. "Are you sure this is the right place for this?" she said.</p> <p>"Yes." I said simply. I reached down and fumbled with the zipper as she began to unzip me. When the zipper was free, I slid my fingers away and slid the zipper down. There were no words but our lips met in a passionate kiss. I held her head in my hands and pulled her down onto my cock as we kissed. She gasped and whimpered as my cock entered her hot, wetâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
