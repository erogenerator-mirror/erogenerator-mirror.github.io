"Last time I saw you you were just standing in front of me with our coffee making machine on the table. Oh, look at that!"</p> <p>Katie nodded knowingly at the tablecloth and saw the same tablecloth hanging off the handle under the surface. David could feel his cock hardening against his shorts as he watched the beautiful woman look at the tablecloth for a long moment. She finally spoke.</p> <p>"David, you look sooo....gorgeous." Katie said, sounding disappointed.</p> <p>"Katie, I don't have much to say." he said trying to think up something to say to ease the feeling of awkwardness that was building inside him.</p> <p>"I'm sorry to hear about your marriage...David, you're a sweet young girl. Don't you ever wish you could say more about that." she said as she turned her chair away from him and looked up into his face with an apologetic look.</p> <p>"Katie, please." he told her with a smile. "It's none of my business. Please sit down." he said as he rose from his chair and helped her set her coffee cup on the table just as her husband handed over the coffee tray. She glanced back at the table, taking a sip of her coffee, then leaned forward at the edge of the table to pour her coffee. David noticed that her blouse was partially unbuttoned and he could clearly see her bra through her bra. Katie's eyes met his as she adjusted the cup of her cup.</p> <p>"Wow," she said after she finished her coffee. "Thank you."</p> <p>"My pleasure." he said with a smile as he looked down at her blouse with a smile himself.</p> <p>Katie raised her glass of iced tea to her lips just as David turned the corner of the room to head back to his seat. She turned over and looked over at her husband.</p> <p>"I'm sorry about that." she said trying to sound apologetic as she sat down. "I was too young. There was too much of a good time between us."</p> <p>"Don't worry about it." he said with a smile as he pulled into the parking lot of his store.</p> <p>David had been thinking about Katie's request. He had a pretty good idea what a young woman like her was going to be like in bed. He was going to have to give her more than a few of his 'personal' encounters this summer and could only hope that she might be able to give oral sex to him every so often. David felt an urge to take her to bed right now. His cock stiffened at the thought of the incredible opportunity he had just made Katie. David took the elevator to the parking garage to wait his chance for Katie to leave. As he stood in the doorway to his shop, his cock was throbbing with excitement and he could feel his excitement rising as he saw his pretty friend standing outside the shop door.</p> <p>"David!" Katie screeched as she ran into his arms.</p> <p>The two young lovers embraced in the doorway for a long moment. Katie's lips were as soft as ever as they kissed deeply. David took one of Katie's hands in his and led her to the sofa. They reclined on the sofa and kissed each other deeply for many long moments. Katie was overwhelmed by David's strong embrace and kissed him like he was the most beautiful man on earth. She pulled off her blouse and bra without protest. Katie had never been with a man like this before and as she removed her skirt and panties together, and David stood and removed his own t-shirt, Katie pulled off his shorts. She gasped when he pulled her body up against his and her breath escaped in a gasp as David's cock slid into her soaking pussy to the hilt.</p> <p>"Oh god" Katie moaned as David pulled back a bit and began slowly pumping his cock in and out of her. They were locked in a sexy French kiss with their bodies pressing into each other. David was in heaven as he began to lose himself in Katie's exquisite body as he pumped his cock in and out of her.</p> <p>"I'm so glad we finally meet!" Katie groaned after he stopped kissing her neck.</p> <p>"Your welcome." David whispered in an incredibly sultry tone as he continued to slide his cock in and out of her.</p> <p>"I'm glad I can finally get home!" Katie said between gasps of breath before breaking their kiss.</p> <p>Katie's pussy felt so good wrapped around David's long thick cock. She had been so hot before that night, and David's long dick had only made her acheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
