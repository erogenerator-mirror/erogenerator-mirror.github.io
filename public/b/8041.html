I teased as I brought the tip of my tongue up to her clit and flicked across it a couple of times.</p> <p>"I didn't like much of it," she sighed and wriggled around a bit so I'd get my tongue into her pussy, making her go a little higher until I got my tongue and then I'd lower my head so I could get my tongue in her slit and I licked slowly around, making sure she was enjoying herself before bringing my tongue back down to where it'd been.</p> <p>We stayed like that, kissing each other as we came down from our mutual orgasms, neither of us saying anything, just looking at each other, trying to read the other's minds. She got into position so she could look down at me, so her pussy was at me eye level. She looked back up at me and ran her hands up and down her body as if to ask for permission or tell me what she wanted, knowing what "what I wanted..." wasn't going to answer her.</p> <p>Without saying much more, I bent down and took one of her nipples in my mouth, sucked and pulled on it a little while my tongue and my lips played with it between my fingers and my thumbs. "Mmm..." she sighed as she put her hands in my hair and began to gently massage my scalp. I slid a finger into her pussy and was surprised to find she was as wet as I'd been told to be.</p> <p>I lifted my head and smiled at her, then looked down at her, seeing her hand on her clit and I put my finger back into her. She seemed to be doing all the work as I licked, sucked, and tongue fucked her with my finger, letting her know where I was and how I was in her. I used more saliva to lube my index finger up, still working her clit as I slid it back into her vagina, then, with my index fingertip, slid my finger around in her.</p> <p>She took a huge breath, moaning as my finger, still moving around in her, made her wetter. "Yes!" She groaned as I pressed my finger further inside. "That's it! Oh god yes, you're making me cum!" She threw her head back and shuddered as I pressed harder as my finger pumped deeper and, still with my mouth on her clit, my mouth pressed against her, she began to buck back and forth, making me finger fuck her to the point she was whimpering every time I'd go.</p> <p>We kept kissing, but now her hands were going to be holding my head and as she got closer, I pulled back a little. She stopped as she saw I wanted to try something different, wanting her to have something different in her, so we switched positions, kissing as we went.</p> <p>I lifted myself off her for a second to watch as her lips parted to show her beautiful wetness on them and her tongue slipped over them again. She took hold of me and ran her fingers through my hair before pulling again and pressing me onto her clit, which I was about to do to her.</p> <p>"Oh, yes!"</p> <p>A second later her body started to shiver, jerking and shuddering like she was having a seizure right then. I felt her pussy clamp around my finger and it made me feel her orgasm, as she was just shaking and shuddering in her climax. As she came down from it, I had her lie on her back, looking up at me as I slowly raised myself up her body until she was lying along side me.</p> <p>"That was incredible, honey. That was just perfect."</p> <p>She wrapped her arms and legs around me, pulling me close. "Thank you, darling." She hugged my neck and kissed my shoulder, which made her shudder and shudder again as she was just so, so, so close.</p> <p>"Honey," I whispered in her ear as I began to move on her. "You're very wet down here."</p> <p>"Mmm," she replied. "That felt so good."</p> <p>She kissed my cheek as my cock slid into her wet hole. "Mmmm," I said, pulling out until just the head remained inside her pussy and then thrusting back into her slowly. "So," I continued as I began to thrust with longer and harder strokes, feeling her body respond with my as she lifted her pelvis up to meet it.</p> <p>Her mouth pulled onto mine as we fucked to her orgasm. A big smile crossed her face as she looked at meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
