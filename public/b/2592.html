I'm very much aware of who's in control here. But, I never felt like I needed to push things too hard. But, as soon as his girlfriend and I had started going out on the weekends - there was only one night a month I was able to stay away from him, and that's only if I wanted some quality time with him. That night I didn't want to make love, and I still love me a little on the rebound. So I sat there.</p> <p>"Fine. You can put the dishes in the sink and then come and take a shower. We can do it naked together."</p> <p>"No!" He said with a laugh. "I just wanted to have a good time with you."</p> <p>"You're such a nice person you know, but there aren't any orgasms in your life."</p> <p>"What's wrong? You've had sex with lots of women already, and I haven't been with anyone as good in a life. And you didn't feel anything yet, and no one needs to feel anything."</p> <p>"That's not true! You're the hottest woman I've ever known. I'm still getting all excited from the orgasms. They are better than being anywhere else!"</p> <p>"Are you kidding." He said laughing as he turned and left.</p> <p>I got up and left the dishes. I put them in the sink. Then I got out my shaving foam and got into the shower. As the cold water washed over me, I let the thoughts and images of him take over. I decided there was no more reason not to give in. I had a chance. I took my time in getting back, washing my hair. Then I looked up to see the mirror. He was getting into the shower, so I decided to get dressed. I put on a very sexy see-through nighty. I checked myself out in the mirror. I looked hot and sexy.</p> <p>"Do you like what you see?" I asked the reflection in the mirror.</p> <p>"You look good." He said.</p> <p>"Turn around and show me."</p> <p>He turned around slowly as I reached around. He turned his back to me. I let my hands feel the muscles of his back, my hands started down toward his stomach. The back of my hands felt nice and smooth. I leaned in to wash his arms. I could feel their heat, it was exciting. His back was tautening, and I could see the muscles moving under their skin. I pulled my hands back up his body, making the muscles of his back tighten and the muscles of my hands were moving in rhythm with my own. I felt so relaxed and so very aroused from the experience.</p> <p>"You've got a great back." I said and smiled from ear to ear.</p> <p>"Thanks." He replied. "I could really use it now, though."</p> <p>I smiled to myself, he looked over at him, and gave a funny look.</p> <p>"Don't worry, I won't let you down."</p> <p>"Then I'll just lay down on this soft bed and enjoy."</p> <p>"Not unless you tell me to." I replied.
