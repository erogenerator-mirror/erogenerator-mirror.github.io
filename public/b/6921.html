The smell of a young woman, a man, had filled the room.</p> <p>The two couples making their way to the bench seemed to catch on to their conversation as they stood and began to embrace. They talked about how different things were now, how different families would be, but all the time in the park they could talk no more. Their embrace became more passionate, as their hands caressed and cupped each other. They watched as a boy got into the car and drove off.</p> <p>The pair of them could no longer hold back and broke their embrace, they started to kiss again, their bodies still hot and wet with passion as they moved to the car. Their hands roamed freely as they rubbed their bodies against each other's. One set of hands caressed her ass as the other cupped her breasts and squeezed them, gently massaging them and pushing them together. As they neared the parking area they looked into each others'. eyes as they enjoyed and looked into each others' eyes as they kissed and touched each other. As their lips parted, they started to walk to their cars while the couple made their way to the park.</p> <p>As the couple left the park they went inside the main building to await the owner. After they got inside the building several minutes later, they entered a room. The sun had come out and was shining brightly as they looked at the large picture window which overlooked the valley floor. The couple walked across the room toward the window and sat down in the middle of the room.</p> <p>The couple sat their hot bodies down on the sofa and looked out into the valley. He had a glass of wine on the coffee table and his friend was sipping on another glass of wine while reading the local paper. They sat there sipping as they watched the sun set behind the valley. They began to caress each other's thighs as they watched the sun. They could feel their nipples hardening as they slowly moved their touch up and down their bodies, feeling their nipples grow and harden under their fingers. Their breathing was becoming rapid as their fingers and palms made their way slowly up to their breasts. After a few minutes of caressing each other, they both sat up and turned to face each other.</p> <p>Their hands stroking as they held each other's face, kissing longingly.</p> <p>As the kiss ended, they sat back in the chair and continued to caress each other's thighs and breasts. They stood up and walked over to the fireplace in their room, where the fireplace lights their way for a moment. They went to another part of the room, this time with the lights dimmed. Their bodies made their way to the middle of the room. As they walked their hands went up each others legs till they were caressing their inner thighs as they stood there. As they neared each other their hands cupped each others' breasts, as they began to kiss again. They held each other close to each other, as they moved the other's body back and forth.</p> <p>After several minutes their kisses turned to long licking kisses. As they became more heated they let their tongues caress each others lips, as they held each others' arms and their tongues began to explore their mouths. As their tongues reached out for each other, the woman's back began to arch as she was very sexually excited herself. A low growling sound started in her throat as she was becoming very excited by the kiss and the feeling of their hand touching each others breasts again.</p> <p>They broke the kiss and stood holding each other with their eyes. Their hands found each other's faces and caressed their mouths, until they were both gasping for air. As their hands moved from their faces to her breasts, the woman began to caress her hands under her breasts, feeling their nipples hardening under her gentle touch. As she continued to caress her warm fingers across her soft flesh, she felt the woman's body trembling with the excitement she was feeling. As her fingers moved slowly down their bodies, she felt her fingers touching the woman's wet bush. She felt her finger slowly running along the woman's hot slit as her finger slowly moved further down until she could feel the wet and smooth shaved pussy under her finger tips. At the same time, she felt another finger on her clit.</p> <p>Suddenly both men got excited as they saw the woman's finger caressing her lips. As they watched her finger disappear into her cunt, they began to moan and groan with the feeling of their own passion. They both looked toward the window to the valley below them. As the sun began to set the sky darkened slightly, making the sky in the valley more blue.</p> <p>As they stood over the window looking at each other, they looked out to the valley side and noticed a tall stone arch which stood there. Their feet moved up the stone pathâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
