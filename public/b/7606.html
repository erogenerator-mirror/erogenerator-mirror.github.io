What did it look like just a few minutes ago. Was it really that crazy?</p> <p>I could still feel the coolness around my body as I sat there.</p> <p>I closed my eyes and felt my body relax. If it were possible, it was then I would have felt a tingly warmth inside, a feeling like nothing else.</p> <p>I started to doze off, and then was startled to hear a noise. I got up and turned around to see that the moon had been moving and was shining down on me.</p> <p>"Hey, it's just me and..." I said, a little voice inside my head that was telling me to get up and be over here.</p> <p>As I closed the door behind me it was like a bolt to be thrown, I could feel myself falling, all I could do was turn and walk towards the moon. I walked slowly in front of the door and tried to remember what was going on. I could hear some sort of noise outside. I looked inside and saw a shadow behind someone, I turned back towards the door as I looked. In front of me stood a man, he was naked with another man at his side. The man had a towel around him, I could see it draped around his head making him look kind of like a man. I could also see his arms and back, and there was some sort of tie around his waist knot as well.</p> <p>The man was holding each of my arms and looked down on my skin, then slowly started to lift them off of me. Both of my arms were lifted up again and I could feel the man kneeling by my feet. He looked up at me and told me to relax and I felt my legs being placed beside him, I could get on my knees and feel my feet come down on the man. They seemed to go on and on.</p> <p>As they were going on the man was slowly pushing his penis in between my legs. His penis seemed to go further and further and it felt really big. It must have been at least eight inches long. The man lifted a couple of my knees, and then had my panties pulled down. He pulled each leg off, one by one, and then got that big thing out. He told me to turn around. He then put my arm under my back which I held tightly in his grip. He guided my legs up to his shoulders, and started pushing my thighs apart. He pushed his penis up into me. I looked down and could see his large cock pushing up into me. He pushed himself up all the way into me with a long hard push. He pulled back, and then shoved it back in again. And pushed me forward, pushing my back down into the man's shoulders. His back was completely arched and his balls were rubbing up against my anus. He started to moan, then told me that I could turn away if I wanted to do something else. I said that I was fine. I turned myself around on my knees to face him. He started rubbing my backside. He said that he wanted me to turn around and get my knees inside the arms of the other man. From my position I could easily see them. He held one of his hands on my shoulder and one on my breast and I could see his face. He told me how wonderful it felt to be with both of these people. He kept moaning. He then put his hand a couple of times onto my lower back to keep it going, which helped me keep my balance. He was really starting to get into this.</p> <p>I couldn't tell how long that was, but by the moans, it was like an hour. I tried to imagine how it felt to have both of them inside of me, it wasn't that bad, there was just something about the experience.</p> <p>I then felt the other man's penis in my crotch also, as the first man was pushing himself up into me now. He was rubbing my clitoris with the tip of it. And he was really starting to moan.</p> <p>As he was getting close to orgasm I started to rub my clitoris faster, and that started him to really buck up into me. This was too much for me though, and I couldn't hold on any more. I started to make small squeals of pleasure. There was an explosion of light as my orgasm reached its peak. I could feel my vagina go spasmodically and every nerve, inside of me, ran on a higher sexual level. As I held myself up on my knees, the man let his penis go out of my vagina and push up into me. I felt this thing hit a nerve in my vagina, and then it was really, really, hard, and I could feel my body start to tremble.
