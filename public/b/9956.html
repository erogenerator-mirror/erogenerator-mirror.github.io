He kissed his way to my pussy and started licking around both sides with his tongue. He started licking me from below the opening up to the top, and up, all the while his fingers were fucking me into heaven. He got a finger in me, then stuck it in a little further, stretching me and pulling it out again. He took it in and out several time, working his way back and forth, and he pulled it from my pussy and rubbed it over my clit. He then pushed it back in and worked it back and forth a little.</p> <p>He started licking me with his tongue. His tongue felt so warm, and his lips moved over my clit with its touch. His fingers kept working in and out of me, as he licked and fingered my pussy. My legs started to shake and as I had another huge orgasm, I started to thrash around all over. I looked over to Mark's recliner and saw him still holding his cock. I looked again to see that he was going to cum!</p> <p>I felt his body jerk and he shot his cum all over my stomach and thighs. He continued licking, as he finished, I started to get up, but he stopped my hand. He sat back down in his recliner, as far away from me as he could get.</p> <p>After taking a drink of water, he pulled up his pants. He had a shit-eating grin on his face, because he knew exactly what he was going to do to meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
