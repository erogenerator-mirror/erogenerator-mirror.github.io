You do believe me when I tell you the way about how it is that you both go on a first date?"</p> <p>"Of course. This sounds like a good story. It's been a long time since a girlfriend had been able to keep me going and I think that you've seen enough sex to fill your imagination."</p> <p>"So, now that you know what a first date means! We'll talk about it in the evening. I'm still recovering from tonight."</p> <p>"The movie and you have both fucked in a night club! I feel a twinge of jealousy," he said with a laugh.</p> <p>The first thing we did in the movie was take turns sitting on all fours. My first time with someone was so wild that in hindsight it wasn't a big deal until we fell in love. Now that it is more than making love, you've got to take chances. "</p> <p>"So, in our movie the two of you fell asleep. You were going to be up in about an hour?" He leaned forward and kissed me on the forehead. "Don't take this wrong. You're pretty wild for your age. It was kinda a fun movie though. Did you see the way he used to tease you?"</p> <p>"He did too. But it wasn't like that. The three of us could get really into it, you know."</p> <p>"You mean like you did tonight?"</p> <p>"I guess."</p> <p>"So I still have time so we better take things slowly," he said as he rose from the bed and pulled me tightly up against him.</p> <p>"So, what happened? Are you ready for this?"</p> <p>"I don't know for sure," I replied while his palms ran up my sides. "Can you just hold me now?"</p> <p>"Is it going to take me all night?" He asked before giving me a light peck.</p> <p>"It might? Well, not really. But, if you want to, it's ok. You're still a virgin. Not exactly what I want. Let's just keep being gentle tonight."</p> <p>He kissed my neck, cheek, ear, and finally nibbled on my earlobe. Then he slowly pulled my dress up so I was naked underneath.</p> <p>I was still a bit nervous. Here I was a college girl in a strange new relationship, in a very unfamiliar and dangerous land. And, it was all going to be pretty intense and not all the same. But, hey, I was a girl and guys had always respected me.</p> <p>I felt my breath become very short and quick and that made me even more nervous. I was really a virgin and if he took off my bra I was probably going to see stars with my pussy. I was really thinking about it though. I never would.</p> <p>"No," I panted, not meeting any resistance from him.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm a girl, and, even if I are an immature, beautiful virgin, it is definitely not acceptable to let someone like you go to the back of someone so young."</p> <p>I heard the tinge of bitterness in his voice and I was suddenly filled with both compassion and lust. I felt his hand on my butt and I turned so he could kiss my neck and shoulders.</p> <p>I felt so much more confident and confident than I had ever felt about myself before. He continued his seduction of me and I let him do his thing. Even when we were in a crowded crowded restaurant with people in the same room, we had this mutual trust that was as close to a bond as two people could give.</p> <p>As he kissed my ear and my jaw bone, I felt as if my entire world was being changed. I could feel his hand rubbing my pussy lips and I became very, very wet.</p> <p>As he teased me more by nibbling me and rubbing my wetness, he slid his hand lower until I felt his middle finger sliding along my slit.</p> <p>"Ooooh you are really wet. I think you want me to fuck you. Aren't you going to let me?"</p> <p>"Yes," I whispered, unable to believe that I was considering the possibility that my virginity might be taken.</p> <p>As he teased my pussy, I wanted to feel him. Every nerve ending in my cunt was alive on the inside. I needed him to fuck me now.</p> <p>"Go slow," I said as I pushed his finger back in my pussy.</p> <p>"Why?" He asked and my answer was simple. Just as I was about to lose my virginity I felt him slide his finger in my dripping, hot pussy. As he continued his slow finger job, he added another finger and I screamed.</p> <p>"Oh fuckâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
