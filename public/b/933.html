I miss my son." she said out loud to herself as she looked out the window and saw him climbing out of the house to go play soccer in his Jeep.</p> <p>She turned to go and found him leaning against the car, and waved when she saw him looking her up and down. She waved back. "No," she said as she waved back, "not tonight. I thought about having dinner tonight but, well..."</p> <p>"And?" he asked.</p> <p>"I told him I wanted to see him again." She said. "I can't do that." And she paused and looked at the Jeep. "No, you can't do that either."</p> <p>"But, if I did, and we did make love, would it be okay?"</p> <p>"Oh! Oh! No. It'd be okay. It'd be very nice."</p> <p>"Okay." He said as he turned the Jeep off and started to drive back to the house.</p> <p>"Hey, wait." She said as she turned around but saw nothing but he was still on the road.</p> <p>"What is it?"</p> <p>"I didn't tell you that he wanted me." She said. "He said he thought it would be beautiful."</p> <p>"Oh right. I thought you said you wouldn't mind."</p> <p>"No. He said he was very happy about that."</p> <p>"So. You didn't tell me you weren't going to do it?"</p> <p>"I didn't tell you the other night."</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Well, now that we are out of the house, I guess I did. At least I thought so. I was hoping we could do that again."</p> <p>"If you mean what you say you did, what you're thinking, I'm glad."</p> <p>She turned around, not waiting for him to say anything else. She wanted to feel that. He could tell she didn't mean what she said. He just wanted to feel that. "I guess we're done talking now."</p> <p>"Do you still want to see me again?"</p> <p>"Yes, I do."</p> <p>"No, I mean yes. I don't think I want to see you again. I don't think I want to see you right now even if we were together again."</p> <p>"So, if you do like me, you just want to fuck."</p> <p>"There's nothing like that."</p> <p>"Do you want to?"</p> <p>"No. I mean, yes."</p> <p>"Well, I'm not so sure about that."</p> <p>"Let me get you something to drink." She said as she started up the stairs.</p> <p>She put a few things in a bag and headed back up to her room, sitting on her bed before she put on some music and laid down. She laid her head on her pillow and just listened to the radio. She was feeling pretty good. Maybe something else would have been nice about this. She was feeling pretty good at this point. She wasn't feeling so bad really about it yet.</p> <p>There was a knock on her door as she was laying there and she checked the time. She was getting a little chilly. She got up off of the bed, turning to the door.</p> <p>"Hey?" She called out.</p> <p>"Yeah. Did you put this on before you had to get ready for work?" The delivery guy said.</p> <p>"Yeah, but I'm not sure if I want to use it. It's kind of warm."</p> <p>"No, really. It's fine. We'll go get some dinner on the way over."</p> <p>"Good idea. Can we use the food cart?"</p> <p>"Okay, sure. Have a good time. Have a good time. We'll see you when you get back to your room."</p> <p>"Okay. Thanks. I don't normally use the food cart. I don't have enough money to get things fixed up right now anyway. What do you think?"</p> <p>"It's not that big of a deal. Let's just have a good time tonight."</p> <p>"Thanks. I wasn't really looking forward to getting back to my room."</p> <p>"That would be nice." He said as he got out of the door then got up from his place on the bed and headed out the door.</p> <p>He looked back, "Have a good evening."</p> <p>"Thanks." She said, "I was kind of looking forward to getting a chance to see you again."</p> <p>"Sure." He said, "It's actually getting on toward 9/30.
