With my phone alarm clock on and a headache over ready I walked to the bathroom to try one last time. Once I got into the shower, I got to thinking about a few things. How could I explain my last night spent with her husband who had so many questions I was afraid I would be thrown out of the marriage. And the only thing I had that she was willing to give up was the part of me that just wanted to go back to this dream again.</p> <p>As I lathered up my body and got dressed into a clean t-shirt, jeans and socks for the weekend and took off the t-shirt I remembered that I wasn't dressed when I walked into the bathroom that night. It was that same dream again. It was one of her giving me an ultimatum, and my mind went blank as I tried to remember what her words were.</p> <p>"You have to do this now!" she said, with a smile.</p> <p>At last, it took me what was left of my willpower to just follow her command, and let her make her choice. We'd had a hell of a lot of time together and, I wasn't sure, I wanted nothing more than to be with her again.</p> <p>With her decision made, I left my house and headed towards the airport to fly to DC airport. I had to be in Miami within one hour.</p> <p>Now it turned out that I'd been there long enough and my flight wasn't to be delayed one more time at all. The flight was to Miami to begin my vacation, which meant waiting for a flight back home. I would be on holiday for a long time, and I was to be spending my last three months at the Miami airport and spending what I'd learned in one week living with my best friend's wife.</p> <p>For now, I turned out to be a gentleman and kept to myself and made reservations at the airport for the four weeks of my vacation.</p> <p>I'd be home in about another half hour. I'd get into the shower and begin my day with a full glass of vodka.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>"Darling," was all I could stammer out as I made my way into the house.</p> <p>The house was a little smaller than what I remembered, but a lot nicer. I got a glass of wine from the fridge and sat on the sofa. The house had been a bit on the dry end as it is, and I've heard some of my neighbors say it was the "newest house in town." I'm sure they say if a person is in such a good mood it works for them.</p> <p>I watched the clock change from eight to nine. It still wasn't until half past ten and I'd have to be back to reality to let her know I was coming back and she'd be with me.</p> <p>There was one more thing to consider: my marriage and her career. I loved my wife, and I wanted nothing more than to spend the time alone with her, but I also wanted to have all the time in the world to think about her. And not just the business I had with my wife.</p> <p>I put on some white knee-high boots, a short-sleeved, pink-striped, and my best jeans. This should give my wife a bit of a break, because I didn't normally wear jeans. I could go without them since I could afford them. I had one hand folded in my lap, as I stared thoughtfully at my wife, who stared back at me silently for a couple of minutes.</p> <p>The first question was, "What is it you're looking for, hon?"</p> <p>She said, "Baby, I think you know. I mean, I've gotten to know you better over the past couple of months, but there is absolutely nothing like seeing you with my best friend and I can just tell you it's just a one-time thing."</p> <p>I said, "I know it's an item, but you're not in my business. Don't worry, I won't take any crap from you."</p> <p>"I know you won't take any crap from me. Let me ask you, what did you think of my job on Sunday?"</p> <p>"I really did like it," I said, taking a sip of wine, "it seems the best place to be for such an event."</p> <p>"I thought so, baby. I really did like it. I think it's a great opportunity for business."</p> <p>I had a good laugh, but I couldn't be too hard on her right now as she knew what she looked like and what was good for business. I looked at her as she stood up and smiled, and I'm sure she could see the conflict in me.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>I was back at the house some time later andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
