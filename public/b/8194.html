You are a friend of the girl’s in line.”</p> <p>“Oh…” she said nervously.</p> <p>“What did you say about the security checks you’re giving me?” he said, pointing at the one who had been leaning against the wall.</p> <p>She was confused.</p> <p>“What do you mean by that, sir?” he said.</p> <p>“The security checks you’re giving me, it is all for information.”</p> <p>She nodded, wondering what kind of check she would have.</p> <p>“You might as well go, now, since we are here,” he said, indicating the one with the security system. “I’m sure everyone on this staff will want to hear a tale of our little girl being raped.”</p> <p>The other girl’s eyes lit up.</p> <p>“Yes sir.”</p> <p>“Good girl.”</p> <p>The security guy smiled.</p> <p>“I’m sure most of you will be looking forward to hearing our little girl being forcibly raped. But first, we’ll leave you ladies to it.”</p> <p>“No!” she whined. “No more!" she was furious and angry, but the humiliation had passed quickly enough.</p> <p>“Good girl.”</p> <p>As she walked away, she heard him mutter “If I hadn’t found her, I would be fucking her right now”.</p> <p>The other girl stared at him but said nothing.</p> <p>“Just go, little one,” he said as he pointed a finger at her.</p> <p>She hesitated for a second, looking at the door she had just come through. She wanted to go see him then and there, but she was afraid.</p> <p>“Go!” was all he said.</p> <p>She closed her eyes and took a breath, not wanting to see him.</p> <p>Later, she would not know what happened and it all would have happened to someone else. Now she had to face that humiliation and feel good about herself.</p> <p>When she entered the club at eleven-thirty that night she saw that no one was around. She looked around the club, thinking she had seen him. There was only one man sitting in the room, though.</p> <p>She saw him. A big man who had been working with her. And she was sure that when he told her that he wanted her to have sex with him. That she would, like him, have sex with him.</p> <p>She looked around the room for her skirt, but her top was gone.</p> <p>"What have I gotten myself into," she asked herself. "I’m so tired," she called it over to him.</p> <p>She had to find out how she was going to get him to fuck her.</p> <p>“Oh God, what have I gotten myself into?”—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
