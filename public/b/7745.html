She felt his erection against the inside of her leg, the hot hardness throbbing against her. He bent over her to kiss her as his hands moved from one side to the other, cupping her face and her hair. She sighed against his lips, her breath catching in her throat as he took her nipple into his mouth, the tip pressing against his tongue, and her breath caught. A groan rumbled out of his throat as he squeezed her breasts, squeezing the weight of them firmly.</p> <p>When he slid his hands under her, his palms massaged her sides, fingers caressing the sensitive flesh there before sliding up and pressing firmly against the firm swell of her belly. He bent to bite at her nipple, his voice low and low as his hands tightened on her shoulders. "I have wanted to do this for hours," he murmured against her, his hands running over her warm skin. "And it is what I want."</p> <p>Her fingers trembled as he kneaded her breasts in his hands. "Please, Sir..." she whispered, her body arching against his.</p> <p>He smiled against her neck while he pressed her, the tip of his erection brushing against her thigh. "Please what?" he whispered, his voice rough and commanding, but his eyes were on her.</p> <p>"Please, Sir," she breathed, the strain of her desire making her voice hoarse. "It hurts." She moved her hips against his, rubbing herself against the hardness pressing into itself, the roughness of his cock making her hips arch. He took his hands from her breasts, pushing down gently so she could feel the heat of his erection against her stomach. "Yes, please let me be where I need to be," she moaned, her fingers moving through his dark curls to his ear. "Can we wait until you are with me, Sir?" His eyes were on her hips, his hands still pressing against her, pushing up and down, pressing himself against her. "Tell me how much you want me."</p> <p>She moved against him with such eagerness, feeling his hands moving to release her breasts. "Please, Sir, I need you to take me."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yes, Sir, I am so sure."</p> <p>He stepped back from her, and she was disappointed she hadn't gone on her way before him, the way she had feared that he had taken her. She had thought he would take her, make her his, but now he had moved away from her without her permission. He sat down next to the woman she had first known as Mistress. She stood in front of them, her hips thrust forward, her eyes focused on them. She knew they would take her if he made her. Now she wanted to take them. Wasn't that the price she paid to have him?</p> <p>He walked over her and laid his hands on her shoulders, leaning over her to give her lips room to open. She felt his lips press against hers, but she wasn't sure she liked that. It felt strange, touching another man. He made her feel desirable and at the same time, a part of her was aching to be with him, to be taken.</p> <p>"How do you feel?" he whispered, his cock brushing her leg.</p> <p>"I am sore, Sir. Should I be sore?"</p> <p>"Not really. It's nothing. But I like the feel of it." His hands moved to her breast, lifting and squeezing, pinching the hard nipple between his thumb and forefinger.</p> <p>"Let me feel," she whispered, stepping back as if the need to be touched were a greater imperative to this man. He leaned over her to kiss her again. When his lips touched hers, she felt her knees weaken. She wanted that tongue against her own, with his.</p> <p>He lifted her slightly, sliding her down until she lay back, looking up at him, her eyes a pleading shade of grey. His lips pressed to hers, pressing just enough pressure to make her tremble. "Take off your clothes," he whispered, his voice rough against her ear. "Get on the pill."</p> <p>"I can't. I can't, Sir," she begged, biting back a desperation she felt she could not hide. He slid off the bed and stood before her. She watched his arms fall at his sides while he turned to the wall, watching with fascination as he ripped the straps, pulling the skirt down and letting it puddle around her feet. He slid his hands behind him to cup his hands beneath his hips, sliding them down to cup his cheeksâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
