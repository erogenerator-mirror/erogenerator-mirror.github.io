I walked down the stairs to find a towel drying on the hamper. As I went to go inside the laundry room, mom came up behind me. "Hey, Mike!" She greeted me in an angelic voice.</p> <p>"Mom?" I asked with a curious look.</p> <p>"You remember this?" She said, holding a stack of bras out. I sat down on one of the beds, looking at the bras. In the second drawer, I saw two pairs of thongs. I picked mom's up, and saw I didn't notice them being inside of these. It was the red thong I wore that day in class, and I knew it belonged to the cute model in the picture above me.</p> <p>"Oh, Mom. Hi! My goodness. Did you like those?" I asked.</p> <p>"Honey, you look...wow! You always look like you just had..." Her voice trailed off. I could only stare at her.</p> <p>"Mom, you look...wow!" I felt my face flush a little bit. "And you have such amazing legs."</p> <p>"I do, and your legs are..." I could only stare for a few seconds longer before I looked at the pictures. I quickly pulled out the panties. They were beautiful. They were black and shiny in the morning. They had a strap, and it ran high around her hips. Mom's hair fell on the tops of the lace cups.</p> <p>"Oh, wow." She said as she stepped closer. I had heard all of these before, having the time of my life to see if I had them in the drawer. I had heard of a couple times, but hadn't had enough time to pick them out.</p> <p>"Oh, you look so cute. I have to tell you though. You're so beautiful." I told her. "I always wonder why you didn't just tell me. I think I may have found you pretty." I said with a wink.</p> <p>"I guess that it's my turn to tell you something. I'm not sure that I'm ready for that yet. I'm sorry, that was just out of curiosity." She answered, smiling.</p> <p>I put the panties in my pocket, and pulled my pants up. "You're not pregnant!" I joked.</p> <p>"Don't be silly. I'm not...and you've never mentioned it before." Mom said. I was suddenly very nervous, being very drunk. I wanted to tell her it was okay if I had sex with her, but it felt like a lie after drinking the alcohol. When she didn't let up, I knew she was going to tell everything. I felt a little better now.</p> <p>"Okay, but I'm pregnant! It is my choice!" I said.</p> <p>"I know, honey. I feel like being a teacher too. It's just like being a kid. It's hard at first, but you learn to talk." She said.</p> <p>"Thanks mom. It's really nice to hear that." I said, taking my panties and stuffing them into my shirt pocket.</p> <p>"You're welcome, baby. I'm so glad that I'm a good mother." Mom said as she kissed me gently on the cheek. I turned to go into the bedroom to change into my clothes, then looked at myself in the mirror. My dress was cut low across my back, in a sort of "V" type, and I could clearly see my breasts and ass through it. The fabric of the dress was very thin across my thighs, and I could easily feel my pussy pressing against it. "Why don't you go grab a cup of coffee and bring it up to my bedroom." Mom said as she took my hand as I approached my bedroom. I stopped on the way there and looked at my own outfit.</p> <p>"I'm not sure how this work. You're not wearing a bra." I said in a teasing tone. "Are you sure you're ready?"</p> <p>"For what?" I asked, turning around.</p> <p>"For the show." She said, giving me a dirty look. I walked towards the bed. "We'll come with, you'll see." I told her and got the cup of coffee. I sat down next to mom and began sipping my own drink as I waited for her to come out from the bedroom. She didn't come out until the coffee was finished.</p> <p>"Have you had a shower yet? I need to clean up a bit." I asked.</p> <p>"No. It's your Mom's fault." She said. "If you can watch the movie while I get out of these," she added and grabbed the camera.</p> <p>"What!"
