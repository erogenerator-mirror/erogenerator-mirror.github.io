The light behind me disappeared and, through the black fabric made of her hair, she found the source of the black hair that lay in shadow and was not visible in the morning sun.</p> <p>I knew this beach, or at least, my entire body, and my body responded. I felt the water as it trickled over my bare, erect cock, making me groan at its touch. She smiled, "You've got a good one, honey."</p> <p>"Oh, oh, oh, oh…." A moan escaped me as I rubbed my cock against her wet pussy. "Oh God, oh God, you feel so good. I can't believe we've been here the longest time."</p> <p>"You know," she said, "the best of the best. It's a great place when you get there."</p> <p>I took her head in both hands, lifted it up and looked deep into her eyes. "I do… it's so beautiful… so natural. Look at all that green… blue. Oh, honey… I so want to show you how much I love you and how much I admire the beauty of this place."</p> <p>We stood there kissing and rubbing against each other. Our mouths made love to each other with the wetness of the surf. I kissed her and opened my lips wide to take her in with my tongue. She kissed me back, and we explored each other's mouth again with our tongues wrestling in the warmth of the other's mouth. Suddenly, a voice behind me said, "I think these two should go."</p> <p>"Oh yes," I said, looking over my shoulder, "we're going to. But hurry."</p> <p>We quickly ran towards the beach, and as I closed my hand down again the black-haired woman pushed ahead and found a place to sit and watch. There on the beach there was a group of five in swimming costumes with their backs leaning against each other for balance and the others just lying there on their backs, just watching and talking. She stopped a moment to watch for a moment, her bare breasts were on display before she pulled off the tiny top and took a small piece in her fingers and pulled it down and over her head. Then she peeled the bottom off exposing her ass to my gaze.</p> <p>One of the girls stopped by her, picked up one of her panties and tossed it to me, "That's a gift."</p> <p>"You're kidding. Oh, my God," I said as I watched her take the first pair off and throw them to me. She looked surprised, "That's a new one."</p> <p>The girl giggled, "You're beautiful," and then said, "But, what I'd rather do," she said to the girl, "is hold my hand if you must."</p> <p>The girl smiled at the suggestion and stepped over and took the first article of clothing from her. I looked to see how she was doing, and I watched as her eyes ran over and fondled the breasts, nipples, and pussy. In the next second, she looked at me and smiled, "You like?"</p> <p>I had already removed my shorts and was lying on my back in the sand when the girl asked, "May I?"</p> <p>"I think you've got a choice," I said, "But, I don't think this is right."</p> <p>The girl took off her shorts and panties, and she tossed them in the sand also, before standing over me. I could see them in her hands and I could see the brown hair in the middle, below her navel. She took her fingers and lifted the hair to her mouth, and slowly placed her lips on the tip of my cock. Then she quickly took me into her mouth, and after a few strokes of her mouth up and down, she pulled me from her mouth and looked at me, "Is it a good enough answer?"</p> <p>I took hold of her tits and lifted her to sit on my lap. She smiled at me but smiled, "If it is. I guess…" I reached around her and took my hands in mine, pulling her down and we were kissing again. She looked into my face and then said, "And, if you're a better lover…" and then she gave me her full mouth full. She pulled away from me then and asked me, "Are you ready?" I just smiled and said, "I'm sure."</p> <p>The girl moved her pussy over my rock-hard cock and settled down, making her breasts swing to the rhythm of my hands. My hands wandered over her back and up and down her thighs, squeezing and stroking her buttock. Her breasts were swinging in front of me, and then she turned her head and kissed me right above my cock. She moved back and forth, grinding her pussy against my cock and making my cock jump in my hands. I reached down and spread her legs apart—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
