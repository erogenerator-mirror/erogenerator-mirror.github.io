"Why would you want to be with a man twice your physical age?"</p> <p>"Do you think I can handle this?" I asked.</p> <p>"Sure," he replied. "In fact, you could never handle a cock any day of the week."</p> <p>"I see. So now I have to decide about my marriage," I replied.</p> <p>"That does not sound like a good choice," he said as he moved forward.</p> <p>He reached for me, his fingers encircling my neck as his tongue invaded my mouth. His hand moved up to feel my chest, the softness of skin pressing against his palm as we pressed against each other, arms tightly around each other. I could feel the growing warmth of his cock growing and he gently squeezed me, the pressure of his large hands on my tits, even through the layers of cotton, which we both knew we were wearing.</p> <p>"Well, in that case, you'll need something else," he said as he moved around in front of me and took my face in his hands, then leaned down to kiss me on my lips. As his tongue slid inside my mouth, pulling my tongue into his mouth to meet his, I felt his hard cock rubbing against my tummy, which was quickly starting to feel warm. A moan escaped my lips.</p> <p>"I'd love to have you," I whispered to him. "You know, it's kind of exciting to me."</p> <p>He gently pulled me towards him and started kissing my neck, down to my chest, my tits, then back up, pausing at my tits for a second, his tongue circling the nipple, the tip of his finger finding the areola, gently squeezing my tit.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," I sighed. "That feels really good," I encouraged him.</p> <p>"You like that?" a soft voice asked.</p> <p>"I guess that means it doesn't matter anymore if it's true, because I want that cock inside of me, too," I replied with a smile, then closed my eyes and savored the feeling of his cock rubbing against my stomach, my tummy...</p> <p>***</p> <p>As we headed into the living room, the two of them were already in chairs around a large flat-screen television.</p> <p>"I thought that I might stay to watch some TV," Greg said excitedly, as he looked at the screen across from him smiling.</p> <p>"Why not?" I replied. "I want to give you something to keep your senses alert to what's around me."</p> <p>The two of them began to watch some show, then he began to rub my back and then my shoulders, while I turned around to show him my ass. I took hold of his hand and began to rub it, sliding it up and down my back, squeezing my cheeks, pushing them at him. He began to move his hand to the top of my shorts, then began to rub my cock through the fabric and then up again as he bent down to lick my ear. I felt my cock throb at his touch.</p> <p>"God you're sexy," I told him. "What's next on the TV?"</p> <p>"You have to ask me that you want something," he told me, as he looked to the camera over the top of the small TV on the ceiling. "Now go and get dressed. I want to fuck you, while you watch," he added with a smile and a wink to me.</p> <p>Once dressed and left the room, I turned the TV off and headed to the living room, where I had prepared some snacks for us earlier in the day before it went completely dark. I noticed that Greg and his wife were busy with some conversation in the kitchen, and looked back and forth across the room.</p> <p>"So what do you wanna do?" I asked, seeing the couple on the TV.</p> <p>"Let's just go outside and see what I guess you're looking forward to," Greg replied laughing. "Sounds good to me," he replied.</p> <p>"What are you two talking about?" I remarked sarcastically.</p> <p>"I don't wanna leave!" Greg exclaimed. "It's our honeymoon, honey," he chuckled, as I smiled at him.</p> <p>"You do what?" I asked curiously, as I watched the couple from my husband's angle.</p> <p>"We're on our honeymoon," Greg said proudly. "We could go out and show off our new toy and see what develops from here," he added.
