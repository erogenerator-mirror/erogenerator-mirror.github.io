I would love to help you bathe.” Her grin still showing in her bright green eyes. With that she slipped her arm around me from behind, and I felt her other hand snake lower. Her soft little hand caressing and exploring. I wasn’t exactly sure what she had in mind, but when she moved up to stroke my cock it immediately began to thicken and swell. Her big and soft hand stroking it, I was pretty sure she was feeling the pre-cum oozing from my piss slit. I just stood there letting her do as she wanted to her, when she suddenly stopped, pushed me back against a cabinet, turned and said, “Lick.”</p> <p>And with that, she leaned back onto the counter, spread her legs, lifted her skirt and plunged her pussy right over my lips. I reached out and cupped her pussy, then my tongue went into her. I ran my tongue up and down her lips, then up and down again. When she was soaking wet she lifted my head, dropped to the floor, spread her legs, and leaned over the counter. I buried my face in the pussy, my arms around her thighs and my hands on her tits. She leaned into my face, my nose and lips sucking on her.</p> <p>She stopped sucking for a moment, pulled away from my licking, and I took in a breath. She said, “C’mon big boy.” The only thing my name is on a woman’s lips is that they want to be licked again and again. I just sucked in air and said, “I like that.”</p> <p>“That’s nice,” she said.</p> <p>“I just can’t describe it. You have the beautiful taste of pussy juice.”</p> <p>My wife is a very sensitive woman. Just being close to her was enough to send her over the edge. She pushed me back, straddled me and then pressed herself down over my cock. My hands were still on her tits and she used them to guide me up inside her. Once there I didn’t really push her down, I just held my cock in as far as I could, letting her guide me in and out of her wet cunt. I just kept my cock moving it slowly between the lips between their lips. With little movements, I pushed her up until her belly came down on the backs of mine. Then with just one or two pushes I let her move down the length of my shaft, then let her drop herself back onto my cock as I pulled her back.</p> <p>She was still looking down, her face was flushed. Her eyes were closed, but her breathing started to get louder. She was moaning loudly, “Ohhhh” and her voice was getting shorter. I was holding her hips tight against me, and my hand was on her ass, my middle finger rubbing the entrance to her ass hole.</p> <p>I reached between her legs to her pussy and rubbed her clit with just the tip of my middle finger, then I moved it up and down on her clit in small strokes. “Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, OH, OHHHHH, OHHHH, ohhhh, OHHHHHH” she started to moan and shudder, then a big spasm of pleasure hit her. It felt as if she was having a continuous orgasm. My cock was buried deep inside her, I could feel it twitch and jerk as her first orgasm hit her. She fell back, her head on the counter, her hands still holding my cock. Then slowly she lifted her pussy lips off my cock. Then she moved down, her mouth took hold of the head, her lips gently engulfed it. She then started to move her mouth up and down the shaft, her lips and tongue going crazy. I was looking up, at those beautiful lips; there is no doubt that she is sucking me hard. Her hand never left my cock, her mouth never stopped sucking it. Then she began to move her mouth in long, tight movements up and down my cock. I couldn’t see her hand from where our bodies were pressed together, but I knew she had her mouth tight around my shaft. Her hand squeezed each ball in turn. Every little movement brought a new thrill to me. Every little touch brought more pleasure. Then she started to slide her mouth up and down and up and down on my shaft. She had the rhythm set to right. She was going so fast, I started feeling my cock rising to another orgasm, so I started to hold her head and push her down on my cock. I pulled my hand back and told her to look at me. She looked at me, looked a little teary in the eye, then she said, “Marry me.”—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
