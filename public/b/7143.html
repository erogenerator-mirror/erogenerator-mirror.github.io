Her head on my shoulder, her hand on my thigh, fingers lightly stroking my erection. She broke her gaze long enough to pull her blouse back up over her breasts and then we both burst out laughing.</p> <p>I tried to explain to her that it was not appropriate to kiss me as a husband in this condition, my heart pounding at the thought. I am no longer a young man in the world of men and women. I know more about our relationship than she does. I knew that, with time we would begin to enjoy our lovemaking more, and I was glad to see that she was still in her conservative Catholic schoolteasing dress and very conservative.</p> <p>She smiled and leaned up to look into my eyes, her face only inches from my own. She licked her lips with a slight touch of her beautiful red lipstick, and kissed my cheek. She was smiling as we got out of the train. It was a beautiful summer day, so we quickly moved our belongings into her backseat. She giggled when she saw that I had no intention of doing so to her, but gave a little smile of hers nonetheless. Once we were settled in the truck, we kissed again, my hands on her butt cheeks.</p> <p>She giggled as our tongues dueled passionately, first to please her. Then her tongue went into my mouth. She pressed her breast tightly into my hand and I began to caress it. Her pussy was wet and warm, the aroma enticing me to touch it further. But my hands were only partially able to respond due to the train ride.</p> <p>My lips roamed over and under her smooth neck, down to her firm breasts, nipples hard and ripe as pebbles and begging my mouth to cover them. I took one and licked it, feeling the softness of her breast against the flat of my tongue, and began to suck on it softly. She moaned softly as I held the hard tip with my teeth, sucking and teasing her pink nipple with my tongue. I let the nipple slide from my lips, taking it between my fingers and gently rolling it, while my tongue circled the tender pink crown. She moaned as I continued to stroke her breasts. I felt her wetness as I moved my hand to her bare pubic mound, slipping a finger inside her and rubbing her engorged clit. Her breathing became a little more rapid as she felt my finger slide inside her, moving it back and forth as I sucked on her nipple.</p> <p>Now I wanted nothing more than to be inside her, to fuck her, to have her cum in my hand as she came for me. However, her reaction was to take my hand in hers and bring it to her lips so that I could kiss her. I had not even gotten a kiss from each other when she did the unexpected move on her part and kissed me deeply, deeply, as she did on the cheek of my car. I did not stop her, and after a long moment I felt her hand softly caress the side of my neck as we kissed, our tongues meeting again for the briefest of moments. At the bottom of her voice she whispered "I've been waiting since we got back to work for the first time for a couple months." She reached down and gently wrapped her arms around my neck and kissed me harder and deeper.</p> <p>I responded by pulling her back against me so that we had better balance in this hot little cab of a ride, the doors open with no chance of our tongues exploring each other. Her hips ground into mine, and we could not have held back if we had wanted to. I moved from her breast to her navel as she moaned softly, and we both knew what we wanted. I pulled her down onto the seat and lifted her out of the truck, taking her panties with me. She stepped out of the car and bent over to pull a cushion out from under the seat, presenting her perfect, tight ass to me, waiting for my cock. She raised her arms to help me pull them up and over her head, and I pulled hers back down. She held on to me tightly as I moved on the floor to lie beside her.</p> <p>She was waiting for me like this, in the seat, on her back, as we looked into each other's eyes, and we began to slowly move between her legs. I could feel the strength behind each thrust, knowing she was taking it as it was going. Once my cock was firmly inside her, she began to rock back and forth on me, her pussy rubbing my cock back and forth as she rocked. Our eyes were locked with each others, and we held each other close, not wanting time to end. She began to breathe more quickly, and our movements got aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
