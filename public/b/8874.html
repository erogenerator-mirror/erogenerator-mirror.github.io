I said.</p> <p>"It is for your wife," she said with a smile in her voice.</p> <p>"What? You want me to just stay like this forever?" I was starting to get upset.</p> <p>"It is what it is, sweetie, because it is what it is. And I get to do what I want with you. You make the choice, you can leave with someone, you see, even if you still love her. And she isn't your wife anymore. She's too old. You can stay with me if you want to."</p> <p>The look of surprise in her eyes was priceless. I wanted her to go back with him, to go back, to say 'I couldn't say anything, and you could.' "But what about my parents?"</p> <p>"You can't just turn in your ticket"</p> <p>"You can leave your truck parked right in front of my garage, right?"</p> <p>"We'll see, I have a car"</p> <p>"But, I don't have one, and I only live five blocks from you, and I don't know anything about you. What if I just let you drive with me? I can drive you home."</p> <p>"No. I think I love you, but I don't love you much anymore. Now go." And as I headed out the door she leaned against the wall and said, I'm sorry. "Can we stay together?" I couldn't answer, I know, I would never get a answer from her.</p> <p>But, when I got home she just smiled. And when I walked across the street she was waiting, and she was kissing me. It was just a kiss to say, you're a good husband. And I was not, like, a good husband or good man. But, in one short kiss, and then it was like, I can kiss you right back, and then I get to kiss her again and then get to make love to her again. And we got to her car, and I got home.</p> <p>And things started to fall apart between us. She left me, took all my things, and came back home. We dated, she told me every bit of things for days, but it just wasn't the same. I'm not sure if she even talked to me, if it was all true, and she did take out her anger on me. It didn't work. And I didn't stop her.</p> <p>Over the next few weeks she really went out of her way to date. Sometimes we would go dancing or just hanging out, or we would hang out after we got in from work. No date, really, just a couple or just occasional friends. But, she was still there when I went out with my friends. She was my "date."</p> <p>But, the "date" was over, and everything just came crashing down. But, the day of our anniversary, she had a small group of friends over. All my friends were going to town, and they were having a good time with her. She wouldn't let everyone in. And for some reason I was having a hard time finding fault with me. And her. I'm sure I was going to be her boyfriend. But I couldn't have a "real" date on the anniversary, I was going out with friends. I couldn't have a "real" date for the whole year.</p> <p>So, on that Wednesday morning when it was only 8:45 in the afternoon, and her friends got up around the same time she was going out, I got alone with her. And we were, you know, kissing each other. It wasn't a kiss of old habits. It was the kiss of a new lover. It was the kiss of a new friendship. It was a kiss that would never end. And it was her tongue that was searching my mouth as our bodies came together, and just happened to meet each other at the same time, but without stopping. It was the kiss of someone who could always tell when I was ready to stop and start. I guess all men find that hard to resist, but she wasn't ready to stop there. We had a fantastic time. And the next thing I knew, she was on her knees, sucking my cock.</p> <p>I wasn't the biggest, she seemed to love taking my whole cock down her throat, she had done that once, I think. And she had given me a blowjob that night.</p> <p>It was an early morning in mid-summer, and the sun was just setting, and I heard people moving about in the yard.
