I was feeling pretty shitty at the moment."</p> <p>I knew she wasn't. We were on each other's wavelength. If she hadn't been there – if I hadn't really cheated, then we wouldn't have been so fucking pissed at each other. If I hadn't done something like that, she would have just been a stupid slut that deserved to be punished. Yeah, that was it. She just wasn't worth the trouble. I knew better. Besides, I'd just have to get this out of the way.</p> <p>"Okay, Mom. I know I know you're mad at me. But there are a lot of things that happened," I said. "Let's start at the beginning. Last night was the first and all we did was get together. And even though I'm mad at you – you have to see what an asshole I've become - I had no idea that I was a cheating wife, in love with a cheating father, and who has no self-respect and was no better at her job. But I just did it for fun and I'd like to thank you for giving me something to remember, the fact that I did what I did to deserve it." Mom looked at me carefully. After we'd talked for a while I realized that she'd probably been crying when I finished. "Mom," I said, "I love you."</p> <p>"I know," she said, "I know," she said. She turned her face away, and sniffled again. "You did it because you love me, remember?"</p> <p>"I love you, Mom. I always have. And yes, I always will. There will be other times when you'll need to know I'm really good with men so you can come to me."</p> <p>"Oh, honey, you've gotta be kidding," she said.</p> <p>"No, I'm not kidding. And just so you know, I can still be so great with you guys, don't expect me to keep it a secret forever. I'm glad you're all together, even if it starts with me and my father, you guys.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she said as we walked through the house. "I don't mean to be all over you like that."</p> <p>"Don't be," I said. I liked that. But I felt it was best if we avoided doing so, because she made me feel awkward sometimes – as if no one was expecting to forgive me.</p> <p>"No, mom," I said, "I shouldn't be saying this that way. Please don't get angry. Really, I don't know why I'm not mad at you, but I'm not mad at you anymore, at all. I think you're being a great father. And it was a lot of fun, too, even if it took a lot of time to get past the fact that it was a man that I wanted to have a child with. And even if I couldn't tell my father he was really my brother, I'd still love to be your baby. If I didn't think I wanted to be in it, that wasn't my fault. But that's just the way things are. No matter what happens between us, at least for one day, I'll always remember the way you did it."</p> <p>She just looked sad. So I said, "And I still love you," and hugged her back, letting my hands fall away.</p> <p>***********</p> <p>A few days later we were sitting in the kitchen eating our lunch, listening to the music playing when the doorbell rang. I opened the door and smiled when I saw Jack, Jack's friend from last spring. We hadn't seen each other in several months, at least not since Jack moved to California. We had only known each other a short while, since Jack and I had moved away some years ago, but we'd gotten more acquainted over the last few months.</p> <p>"Good morning, Jack!" I said.</p> <p>"Good morning, Honey," he replied. Then he glanced at my daughter and said, "You know, you're prettier than her, maybe even prettier." We exchanged smiles and turned, leaving him standing there stunned.</p> <p>"I heard about your daughter. Oh, did that really happen?" I said.</p> <p>Jack blushed, turned away from me, and whispered, "Yeah, it did, Mom. She was the one that told me I was the only one to pick her up and that I should take her shopping the next afternoon"</p> <p>"Mom, she's not the most beautiful girl in the world," I said. I turned and walked out through the living room, leaving him standing there looking stupid.</p> <p>I returned with a bag of clothes that I'd already put on and walked back into the house. I opened the bag and took out one of the outfits that Mom had bought for—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
