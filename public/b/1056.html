I'll see you both next week."</p> <p>"Bye," said the second girl. As they left I watched as she crossed the patio and headed to the door. She was obviously the reason behind her disappearance. I wasn't certain if she was actually going out on another date.</p> <p>As I passed her, I said, "So... did you have a good time last night?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes, we had a wonderful time. A couple of fun times and I am happy to say I haven't had a single one too many. It's a great change for me."</p> <p>"How was the movie?"</p> <p>"Very enjoyable. You?"</p> <p>"It was very good, but I was a little scared. There wasn't anyone here for an hour or so."</p> <p>"Well go get dressed and I'll see you the next time you're here," I said as I turned and strode into the bedroom area to change.</p> <p>"Wow! That was good! I definitely want to try that again," said the third girl as she entered the house. "Well, that was my last visit. I'll get dressed and be home by Monday but at least we'll be alone. Do you want to just watch? You can put on some music if you like. This will be your last time before the semester ends, right?"</p> <p>"Sure. Maybe I could try out just a few of one of your musicals," I responded. "I think that was just about the best thing I could have done."</p> <p>The three girls left after some discussion and eventually I took a shower to wash the lingering taste off my lips. What now I didn't know was that I was not leaving the next semester. In any event, I got to spend more time with my new friend, and we got together several times over the next few weeks. But it wasn't until the spring break period when I found myself again alone. Of course I was at the university during my freshman year, but it was always the college on that end of my field. It felt like the end of my life. As I told that story, on one of our breaks we all had an awkward moment during the class. The girls all looked like they'd seen a ghost, and as we continued to talk I realized I hadn't. A few seconds later I felt a hand caress my leg and I looked down quickly to see that it was Amanda. She looked over and caught me looking at her. With a mischievous look in her eyes she smiled at me knowingly.</p> <p>"Oh, I've noticed," she said with a giggle. Before I could respond she leaned over and whispered a quick kiss to my nose as she slipped back into her seat. Then she said, "I've noticed that you've never come to the movies with us. I thought it'd be fun if we came to the movies together."</p> <p>"It's okay, we can sit together in the back row," I offered.</p> <p>"No, I think it would be a better way to have a good time in an auditorium than to go in and sit next to your row and watch everyone else take their seats." This time I wasn't really laughing and Amanda just looked nervous. So I decided to try something different. "So," I said, "what are you watching?"</p> <p>She had a look on her face that was pure confusion. "Oh, I...I thought you'd never ask," she answered after a few awkward moments. "I'm really fascinated by this movie."</p> <p>"Why do you think I've never been in it with anybody? It seems like you're the only one who ever gets it."</p> <p>"Well, I think that's an awfully long time ago. But you know, I'm still not sure what to believe."</p> <p>"It's okay, I know, I just wasn't sure what to expect."</p> <p>As I stood and walked around the table, Amanda asked me if I would like to come to a few of her concerts before the semester ended. As she sat with her legs tucked up under us, I took her hand and we began walking out to her car.</p> <p>"It was nice, but I'd really like to stay if we were going to a concert at this school," she said as we were walking down the dirt path.</p> <p>"Me too, I'd really like to go to those. But how about we stop at these," I suggested.</p> <p>"Okay, sounds good. But please bring a change of clothes," she said as she led the way back to the car.</p> <p>Once we got to the car, we got back in with Amanda sitting between my legs almost immediately. Once I was sitting straight up, the two of us got a good look at her. The dark slacks she was wearing were very tight andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
