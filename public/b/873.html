All afternoon he had been talking to friends around the house, but she didn't like it when he was in the presence of her in front of other people. She was always dressed conservatively, but she was a little wild from the club, and she was very different than the guys he had been with before. The men he had been with knew how to treat a woman but he never enjoyed their advances, let alone touching her.</p> <p>He had taken to the game, the "treat the hook from the hook" game he called it, and it had become a favorite, too. She was still an attractive woman, and some might say, a hot one. He was in college and hadn't had the courage to pursue it. His friend Jim was now in his late forties and had finally got his college education and had decided to move back home instead of just staying in with someone close to his age. He had found a great young woman who he didn't want to see leave the city on his friend's kid. She really did remind him of the high life. But he still found her attractive. For some reason she seemed to get into his head as much as he did. Now, if he had been anywhere else, he would have told her to change in the club.</p> <p>It was past five in the evening and the party had concluded. Only a handful of people had left, but it had been a slow and lonely affair. Jim had just sat down on the couch with a drink. While talking to a blonde, the women had come back and was in the process of opening her coat to reveal a set of nice sized boobs, and her skirt was so tight it was almost see-thru. Jim liked being the center of attention but knew that at least another man would notice. The blonde in the coat came around and pulled her coat off. Jim could not say a thing because it was too late. This woman was a knockout! At 5'8", her 38B breasts stood on her chest, the areolas were large and very dark, and were tanned and pink as well as the hair on her mound where it seemed there was a slight damp spot. Jim had his eyes fixed on her boobs, and she seemed to notice it too.</p> <p>"You know I would love to have you all night."</p> <p>Jim thought it was odd. One of the other women in the group had said that she saw the same thing. "Oh! Do you know this is what I have been looking for! I have been looking all over for you all night!"</p> <p>"I think I will join you in a drink."</p> <p>They were both a little tipsy. It really wasn't unusual for him to have an eight to ten shooter, and then spend a bit of time with a couple of very attractive women. When the woman next to Jim arrived, she was dressed in a black cocktail dress. Her legs looked very good on legs, especially with a few inches under the low top she wore. The dress reached her knees and had a scooped neckline that showed some cleavage. This dress was short and showed off her figure very nicely.</p> <p>He watched her walk into the house with a glass of red wine. It was clear she was not an expensive drink. She had obviously been drinking. The man had sat down, too.</p> <p>As the four women moved about the large room Jim had a little time to survey the crowd. As he watched the women came over to him and began to rub his legs. Then they both took a sip from the wine glass that Jim had set on the coffee table. He took the glass as he was walking down the stairs before his eyes went to the window. The woman stopped in front of him and began to sway the hips of her partner, almost as if she was dancing. They were both tall enough to almost reach him with the heel of their shoes, and they were both completely bare. They each had a hand on the man's thigh, and he had one leg up on the bed. Both women were rubbing his leg from their feet up to his crotch, causing the man to moan a little. They continued down to his cock, where they each began to rub it through his pants. Jim had to take a step back and put a couple of fingers up his trouser fly. He began to stroke himself and then began to back away. Jim was sure he saw the panties of the woman next to him under the dress. They continued to rub him together, as if he were on some sort of sexual high. Jim had to stop it right there, but he could tell even if he wanted to stop. He stopped it again as he thought he heard "Oh! I see it! His friends here!"</p> <p>The blonde and the blond came into the room together. The redhead was wearing a see-thruâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
