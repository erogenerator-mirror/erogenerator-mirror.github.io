I could tell that the boys really enjoyed their day by your enthusiastic responses when you were getting the massage." A smile grew on the professor's face.</p> <p>"Thanks I guess. As for me, I'm not that kind of girl."</p> <p>He gave her a long passionate kiss that she returned, then rolled back onto his back. "Well, that was interesting."</p> <p>"Yeah, it was educational. When she said you were really into it, it was more than interesting, it was kind of a turn on." She grinned and patted him again, "Now, you'll be paying for our next lessons."</p> <p>"We have to get back to the office," he said with a wicked lopsided grin.</p> <p>"So, did you and your girlfriend go all the way with it?"</p> <p>"No. We got to the hotel early because her family has a house up the road with a pool. I got to her door first, I was kind of scared and she wasn't home, she couldn't go in."</p> <p>"Oh, that's nice," and a grin took over her face.</p> <p>And that was that. That is all it was. I found out my girlfriend had taken the next steps in an effort to see if I would accept her as I now was. After that she wanted to become a nudist, so in a year or so we both graduated from university and started dating again.</p> <p>She was very active. We had sex several times a week. It was a wonderful time. It was also our little secret. It was also the first time I had had a good look at her ass or breasts and a good feel of her pussy. If she had told anyone that we went to a lot of the same beaches, I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more.</p> <p>It didn't take long for the two of us to get an engagement. It happened on one of our visits to the beach that spring day. There were already people on the beach, a few more than others, but none had been in the bathing area. We were in the midst of doing what everyone had wanted to do, playing in the water. We had gone into a local pub a couple of times, but there were probably only about ten people there.</p> <p>That would have been enough to keep us going until we were about two hundred yards into the water and about six inches deep. The next dive took us straight into the surf to get off.</p> <p>We were all sitting in the water when I looked at her to see what she was thinking. "What are you thinking?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't know, I've never done this before and I always feel embarrassed," I said, "but I don't regret a thing."</p> <p>"Well, you do deserve a try," and she came closer to me, "and how would you feel about me, a girl after my best friend, if you had a boyfriend?"</p> <p>"That is an amazing question," I said, "and maybe even a little hot to ask."</p> <p>"How about if I showed you my hand?" she said, and she reached out and put a second hand one in mine.</p> <p>I was shocked, but her arms around my waist, and my cock started to harden.</p> <p>She pulled on me and we went out of the water and over to the blanket that she had brought, her tits still inside of a swimsuit and her nipples were as erect as before.</p> <p>"Oh, wow," was all I could say, "I had no idea. I couldn't believe it.</p> <p>"Are you okay with it? It just turned me on so much, what it is like to be a girl. You're so sexy." I felt as though my voice was coming out in a throaty sort of way, my hips were moving up, and I had her breasts in my hand.</p> <p>"I guess you like it too" she replied, and she slowly lowered herself onto my fingers, "and besides, we would look much more comfortable in here."</p> <p>The hot water felt wonderful, especially when I felt the soft skin of her breasts pressed against mine, which made the moment almost awkward. We hadn't done anything with others when we had visited the beach, and certainly not a single other in the water.</p> <p>Her arms and legs were wrapped around me, and I could feel her pussy rubbing my fingers. I had felt her pussy on my fingers before, and I could still feel it. I could also feel myself growing hard, and I tried to make as much of myself as I could down there.</p> <p>But when she lifted herself up off me, and said, "I'm not through with you yet, I got one more lesson to make." She lowered herself down again and pressed her lips to mine.
