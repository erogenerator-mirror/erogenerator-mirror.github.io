On the way back to her room, she told him he could stop by her room if he wanted to catch up on their plans. She sat with her laptop on another one of the tables, but she was watching a TV show. When he arrived, she took him into her bed, and they kissed, and she was rubbing his cock for all she was worth. His cock was getting hard again, and she pulled the zipper of his pants to the side, and pulled it out for him. She rubbed his cock, and said that he must have been saving himself up for her, like she knows how it feels, and that he wanted to take her again.</p> <p>He said he wants to fuck her all night, and she said, that will go down both ends. The next night, she had him at her room and was naked, ready, while he lay on a bed in her bed, and he was thinking about what had happened when she had fucked him. The next morning, she told him that she hoped she could arrange something in an exciting way.</p> <p>They showered together, washed each other thoroughly, and got ready to go out. He told her his favorite place was in New York. They spent the rest of the morning shopping and drinking. Then they went out for a few hours at the casino. It was on the way home that he decided that he would just have to pick her up and bring her to her room.</p> <p>His phone rang three times at the casino, and when he got there he found her in a booth with her arms folded across her chest and her eyes on the floor. He thought for a second that he had just let out a scream, and when she heard the zipper and his voice calling for her, she said "You can't come up here, you'll be late."</p> <p>They had a beautiful dinner and two hours later he was going to pick her up and bring her to her room, and she would be glad of it. The next morning at work he had to rush to catch a train to a business meeting so she wouldn't have to work, but he was going to make the drive up. When he reached her floor, and she asked him to come up to her room, where he could see the hotel, but the only thing she could see in the lobby was an old dark wooden coffee table, and on the far side was a window with a big gold cross hanging over it.</p> <p>"I'll do it for you, honey, and the next time you want to come up here, just call in sick or something."</p> <p>She smiled at him and said "I'll be so glad that you do that for me, honey. I just never knew that a guy like you could do it that way for such a short time."</p> <p>After work, he got in his truck, and drove back to his hotel where they spent the afternoon and night alone. That night, they had a very erotic evening. Later, he helped her into her bed and undressed her until she was bare except for her panties. Then, he laid on top of her and they made love, with a passion he had never felt. They never did it in the missionary position, or they went like that several times after he had made love to her for hours.</p> <p>As they lay together talking, he wondered if maybe it would soon be over. They had a great time together. She told him that she had given him her virginity, and that she loved it. How long would it be before she wanted to give it again, again, again?</p> <p>He looked at the clock. It was one o'clock in the morning, so they had to get up and go to work, before they got a chance to talk and get to know one another. She kissed him, and said "I think it's time this has happened before," and she got up on her elbow and looked at him with a big grin on her face.</p> <p>"So we have to get together now," was her reply. "But before that happens, I want to be with you the whole time" she said, "And I'll want to be by your side every time that happens. We'll do that together, and I'll never give you a reason not to."</p> <p>As they lay there, his hand touched her bare leg and ran over her legs a few times, as gently as he could. It was very erotic. He kissed her on the cheek and she reached between his legs and caressed his cock, and asked "Would you like me to take care of you while you're taking care of me?" He replied that he would, and she wentâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
