You can even do any of it you want."</p> <p>"God help me, why would I want to hurt someone so badly?" he asked, the worry clearly overblown.</p> <p>"Just like this," she replied, giving him a wink.</p> <p>He smiled, kissed her forehead, and then pulled away, his cock springing to attention. "How's that, big boy? Are you okay?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm fine. Don't you ever get tired of me when I'm trying to make love to you?"</p> <p>"You can't just put all that love into one word, do you? Okay, how many strokes of that cock will you perform for me?"</p> <p>"All of it?"</p> <p>"Of course, baby."</p> <p>He stood up, pulling her to her feet. "I'll get some lotion."</p> <p>He walked into his bedroom as she stood by the chair. Looking at him, she asked, "Okay, where can I put it? Do you like lotion?" while she was holding him by the hand.</p> <p>"The lotion is great, honey. It's all warm, too," he said, stepping over to the small table and picking up a pair of white gloves.</p> <p>"All right, here it is, let's get some," she said, holding the back of the gloves to his fingers. He held a hand up behind his head as she held the gloves over his hand. "Do my feet, and that's enough." After he finished, there was a big smile on his face. "That's pretty good, too."</p> <p>"Yes, baby, that's about it for me," she said as she began to get out of her chair. "Now, I'm going to put some lotion on your hands and then we're going to do the rest of your body."</p> <p>His palms were as white as she was, and she had to hold two of his fingers before she could slide and smear the liquid over the surface. After she was done, she said, "I want you to take your time with my feet."</p> <p>"Okay," he said, taking his place behind her so that she could have her feet exposed.</p> <p>"Here," he said, handing her a white, cotton, bath robe. "How do I look?"</p> <p>"It's beautiful," she replied. "You're not too old to be beautiful."</p> <p>"My goodness, I don't think so. There's nothing you'd look better than me."</p> <p>He smiled again. "Do you want me to put it on?"</p> <p>"No, I just love your eyes," she replied, wrapping the robe about herself. "I really do. You're a nice person and you don't need to wear any makeup and clothes. You're very pretty and you're so sexy looking." She reached for the robe and opened it quickly, letting the garment fall past her stomach. "My heart is going to beat all that noise the rest of the night."</p> <p>"I'm going to take a shower and get cleaned out. Are you ready?"</p> <p>"That would be delightful."</p> <p>He walked back into her bedroom, a wicked grin on his face as he handed her the robe. "I had a fantasy about you, my princess. I don't think this was intended to be a big one, was it?"</p> <p>"You better believe it, honey. I don't care if I'm old, I don't care if I'm ugly. You look stunning as you are and just as sexy. If you're not too nervous, we'll keep going," she reassured him.</p> <p>"You've got me. That's not a difficult thing to do, is it? I'm going out."</p> <p>"No, silly. I'm not going to be nervous. I'm going to take my shower. Want to join me? I think it might be fun."</p> <p>"That would be fun." He grabbed a towel and walked into the bathroom. She got in the shower as he slipped in behind her. He grabbed his hand as he pressed his body up against hers. She reached out and wrapped her arms around his neck as she felt his breath on her shoulder.</p> <p>"Ohhhhh, this feels so good," she said, rubbing her hands down his chest, then down his arms. He bent his head to kiss her shoulder and neck a little. Her skin felt soft under her hands.</p> <p>"Are you nervous?" he asked, brushing his lips against the top of her shoulder.</p> <p>"Yes, a little," she replied, her voice a little unsureâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
