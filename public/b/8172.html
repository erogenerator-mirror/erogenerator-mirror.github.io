You can have him if you want."</p> <p>"But I haven't got my hands on this. Can I get him for free?"</p> <p>"What's with the money?"</p> <p>"My sister-in-law."</p> <p>"Oh, you're joking aren't you? And he's only 19 so you can't be sure whether he's old enough to do that?"</p> <p>"No, that's a lie. How will you know?"</p> <p>"By looking at my picture now," he said.</p> <p>"It's not my picture," I insisted.</p> <p>"Oh no it isn't!"</p> <p>I stared at him, incredulous.</p> <p>"That's my friend," he said, not taking his eyes off mine. It made me look into his eyes and see that he was looking at me intensely. "Are you sure I'm not trying to fuck you?"</p> <p>"No, but how can I say I'm not trying?"</p> <p>"What's that?"</p> <p>"I think you're looking at me differently, more like trying to say, 'How can I say I'm not trying to have sex with you?' If I were a girl, I'd swear to hell that they'd be kissing."</p> <p>He grinned at me. "How on earth can you think of kissing a woman you don't even know that you're seeing a man?"</p> <p>I laughed. "You got me."</p> <p>"And that is?"</p> <p>"We're just friends?"</p> <p>"Yeah, but I didn't know you were interested."</p> <p>"No, I am not attracted to men," I protested. "I'd rather spend some serious time with you than to be doing anything with you."</p> <p>"No, you wouldn't," he said quickly. "I just meant that I'd like to be able to go out for a meal or dinner with you. And if you decide to go back to your wife by the end of next week, we'll have to go on a date. What do you think?"</p> <p>"Is this making any sense? You're proposing that I spend the night in your bed? But you've never fucked me in this bed before."</p> <p>"What?! No," he said. "How can you think that? A night in bed with a sexy woman like me can be a romantic and romantic relationship, and a woman you're not supposed to be fucking? I'm not suggesting that we go to bed with you for sex, I'm just saying that we should, um, go on a date, if you want."</p> <p>"I don't know what you're—"</p> <p>"Well, yes! If you're not going to say a word—you can just be very quiet." He was staring at me more intently now, and I could see his hands trembling as he tried to gather his courage.</p> <p>"Look, I'm sorry. I don't know what happened last time. This is not a good idea."</p> <p>He looked at me like I was crazy and asked, "What you don't understand is, I want to make this right."</p> <p>"What is it?"</p> <p>"I, uh, I don't want you to just fuck me forever. I want to make love for the rest of my life. We're just friends, right?"</p> <p>He just stared at me for a long moment, then said, "Okay, maybe a date in your bed is a good idea."</p> <p>"You don't understand. What are you suggesting then?"</p> <p>He just grinned, looking at me like I was crazy.</p> <p>After a pause he said, "I just want to make sure that we really are, uh, friends." Then he looked at me and asked, "What are you thinking?"</p> <p>I had no idea how to react to that last one. He was making me do things that I had never dreamed of doing, something I would never have imagined in the past. After he said those words my mind was full of those two words, he looked right into my eyes and said to me, "You have a choice. You'll go out with me, I guarantee it."</p> <p>"What?" I asked, surprised. "I thought we were friends."</p> <p>"No, we're not." He smiled, and then started to say something else, but I was so happy now that I pushed him away.</p> <p>"You're going out with me?"</p> <p>He just winked at me and said, "Yes."</p> <p>"Okay. What are you suggesting?"</p> <p>He looked a little confused, and he said, "I think it would be better if we go on our date somewhere else, than that night we went to your house and—"</p> <p>"No, I insist." After a moment, he added, "You're going out with me—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
