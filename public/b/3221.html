He was a complete mess as he lay under her, trying to get his breaths back. She wrapped her arms around his waist as he held her leg, squeezing it hard as she came down. Lifting his leg, she lifted it to his waist and then sat on him. He felt her juices flow along the length of him as he grabbed a hold of her hips and slowly and steadily worked his stiff cock into her wet pussy. The feeling of tightness was almost overwhelming as he got deeper.</p> <p>She put a finger up to her mouth, tasting herself on it, while she continued to ride his cock. "Mmm," she said with a nod.</p> <p>"You ready?" she questioned.</p> <p>"More than likely." He smiled as he pulled out of her to get another hold. He sat on the edge and placed a hand on each of her hips as he pulled her in, leaning against that side. When he reached around and squeezed her tits, she reached up his chest on the opposite side of the bed. Her fingers dug in as he held her in place. One knee to the ground, he reached up and slid her hair back, the back. His cock throbbed, the head throbbed and the feeling of her tightness filled him up.</p> <p>"Yeah," she moaned as he rubbed along the inside of her leg, slowly pulling the leg up and letting a drop of clear fluid drip down her thigh.</p> <p>She was breathing deep. With eyes closed, she leaned down and began to lick his chest. She began to suck on his chest lightly as his dick moved in her. "Oh wow, that...that..." she said as his hand slipped down to feel his balls, caressing gently.</p> <p>"Mmm," she moaned as he ran his fingers through her hair, massaging her scalp and pulling her hair. She was now leaning into his side, looking up at him, with a lazy look on her face and a smile on her lips.</p> <p>She lifted her face for a moment, looking at him slowly. "You okay?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yeah," he answered, his cock throbbing as she leaned her head down.</p> <p>"I want to do something about that," she said as her hand fell to his balls. "I want to let go."</p> <p>"Sure," he said, moving his hand from her. "How'd you do that?"</p> <p>"I dunno." She leaned in and put her lips on his, pressing her body against him. She felt his hand on the top of her head as he moved her mouth to his and kissed her back.</p> <p>"Oh my," she said after a few breaths. "I can..."</p> <p>She kissed her way down his chest, taking his nipples between her thumb and forefingers slowly and slowly, feeling them stiffen beneath her. She reached and began to pull on them, while her thumb and forefinger tightened around his shaft.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck," he said as she took up one hand, then the other, squeezing his balls.</p> <p>"You ready?" she asked, licking and flicking his nipple in between her teeth.</p> <p>"Yess." Her lips locked around his nipple, her tongue flicked at it as she moved her mouth to take a nipple into her other mouth. Her hips began to buck and her pussy tightened around his dick as he moved his hand down to her pussy. She slid her finger down her slit as he moved both hands to her hips. "Oh! I...I need...I need...do...do a...bump..."</p> <p>"Okay." He pushed her up so she was sitting on his lap. She wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled her hips closer.</p> <p>The feeling of her pussy was more intense in that position as he slipped a finger beneath her. She felt her muscles contract as his hard dick slid in and out of her, while she wrapped her legs around his. She was going wild under his hand as he slowly pushed it upward until finally, a second finger met her opening.</p> <p>They were both panting, their legs shaking as they moved against each other.</p> <p>"Oh," she said again.</p> <p>"Oh?" he asked, grinning as he felt how tight she was around him.</p> <p>"I...do..." she stammered. "I...just need help."</p> <p>"Okay?" he pressed his finger in circles. His finger curled against her, then his thumb found her clit. "Oooooooh. Okay."</p> <p>"But...I...I didn't say anything...I'm not sureâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
