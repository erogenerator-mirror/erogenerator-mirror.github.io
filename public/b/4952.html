I said as I pulled the hairbrush from the end of the tub.</p> <p>"I had a feeling that you had something special for me, too, didn't you," she teased me, her hand creeping higher up my thigh again until it rested on my rock-hard boner.</p> <p>I pulled my hand from our lips. "I've got a surprise for you. I might not tell you everything, but I'm a man of many secrets. It's been two years for you," I said as I leaned down and kissed her.</p> <p>"Just kidding," she said, kissing me gently on the lips again, "I just wanted to wait until this was all over. I'm just so excited!"</p> <p>"I wasn't kidding, honey. I'm really excited about this."</p> <p>"I know you're excited, and I love your cock."</p> <p>"Now you're teasing me," I responded, pulling her around so that we were facing each other. I looked into her eyes. "I really want to play with you, too."</p> <p>"Honey," she playfully punched my shoulder, "what do I do?"</p> <p>"Get out of the tub, and I'll show you," I responded, and then quickly got out of the tub.</p> <p>"Come here," I said, pulling her against me like a bear.</p> <p>She looked at me, and then followed me as we walked to both of the bedroom door. By now our clothes were scattered around the room, and the bed had already been brought in, revealing the bed and the bed cover over it with the exception of the bedspread. The covers had been pulled down, revealing a black velvet robe for me. It was all of the silk I had used at my first date of marriage. I couldn't wait to see the robe on her body.</p> <p>"Take off your robe," I said softly as if I were in a trance. "What? Oh, I just got undressed."</p> <p>"You're so beautiful. It's just a nice surprise."</p> <p>She blushed some as she undid the buttons of her robe, revealing her beautiful body. Her body was taut with small breasts, but the nipples stood erect between her crossed arms. It was a combination of her tanned skin against the pale pink flesh of her breasts that I had just watched her do over and over. Her body was incredible. I wanted to jump her right then and there. I wanted her right then and there.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I said, "I've got a surprise for you!"</p> <p>"Why don't we get you out of that?" she responded, taking it from my hands.</p> <p>"Let me get some oil out of the medicine cabinet," I said, reaching for it.</p> <p>"No, I want the bathtub ready, too," she said, as she handed me the oil bottle.</p> <p>We walked back to the bed, and I sat on it, watching her.</p> <p>"It might be a little warm in there," I said, "you are so beautiful."</p> <p>She reached to her side, and I thought I felt the material of her nightshirt, but I couldn't be certain. I pulled my hands away and went back to touching myself, rubbing my fingers along the outline of my aching cock. I was going to explode any moment. The oil and my thoughts of what was to come were working together. I would use the oil or she could take charge. I couldn't decide.</p> <p>"Why don't we go into the bathroom?" I said, "I'll use the bath."</p> <p>I quickly took my clothes off, and then sat on the edge of the bathtub, my cock still in my hand. I looked her questioningly at my erection.</p> <p>"Go slow, honey," she answered, "I just want to watch."</p> <p>I turned the water on, and then sat down on the toilet seat to enjoy the warm and relaxing sensation once again. I heard the water and saw her standing near the side of the tub, in the half-light of the room.</p> <p>"This is great," I said. "I'll use the shower when it gets warm. You go first, to wash up."</p> <p>She walked into the bedroom and bent over in front of me as I watched. I sat there, my cock still in my hand, letting my legs dangle down, and just sat there, transfixed.</p> <p>"You can sit on the edge of the tub if you want to," I said, indicating the end of the tub. She complied, with her ass wiggling around as she did.</p> <p>"This will do," I said, taking another swig of the beer she had brought with her.
