But right now it's all worth it."</p> <p>"Why do this?"</p> <p>"Because I want to." She leaned back in her chair, letting her robe drop. "Please, come sit on my lap."</p> <p>I looked around nervously.</p> <p>"Please."</p> <p>I sat on her lap with my back to her. I was trembling slightly and looking at the book that she was reading.</p> <p>I was sure she couldn't read it. And I mean that word. The word that she was reading, if she read it, what she's going to experience is something I can't read. So, she was going to take that word right out of her own hand.</p> <p>I knew what she was going to do, so I put my hand on her face. I put it over her lower lip and looked into her eyes.</p> <p>She smiled at me and ran her hand over my head. She ran the tip of her tongue over it and then pressed her finger hard into the base of my cock. She moved my cock up and down, massaging just the head, then pulled it back up with her mouth.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me right here," she said.</p> <p>She put me in her arms. "I haven't done this before. What about you?" she asked me.</p> <p>I held her face with hands up against her cheek and leaned forward to kiss her. Our tongues touched and she squeezed my face just a little and the kiss heated up. When she pulled away to breathe, she looked up at me and kissed me again. A little harder this time, then started slowly stroking. The kiss heated up before she drew away again.</p> <p>This time, a little deeper, I pulled my mouth away from hers, pulled her robe open a little and knelt down. I looked up and down the plane and she was looking me up and down with those beautiful eyes. I stood and leaned down and kissed her lips once again. She pushed herself back again against her chair, my hips pressing closer to her. She brought her hands up and grabbed the hair on the back of my head. I kissed her again, more urgently now, pulling the hair gently. I was so hard it looked like I was going to pop right off the tip of my dick.</p> <p>She pushed back against me, her hands on my hips, and I felt the head of my shaft pressing against her outer lips. She pulled back and I pushed forward. I didn't want to make her uncomfortable. I pulled back from her.</p> <p>"I'm going to fuck you."</p> <p>That statement just made me crazier.</p> <p>"I don't care," she said. "Put it in."</p> <p>All the words came easily to my mind as my head cleared through her pussy lips. I wanted to drive into her and fuck her hard until she screamed. I felt my own cock pressing hard against the fabric of my panties. In my head, I was so caught up in wanting to fuck her, I had forgotten everything except for how good it was to have someone feel my body, how deep I could make her take me.</p> <p>I pushed into her with long, slow penetrations and felt her body tense and let out a little moaned. She reached up with one hand and grabbed my ass. She pulled me into her as hard as she could, trying to keep from tearing my clothes off. She felt how thick, hard, hard as steel and the way it felt deep inside. The way she wanted me. She moved her hips more quickly against me and the feel of my flesh touching hers made her feel the way I felt.</p> <p>I pressed hard into her, pushing hard into the silk of her panties. She moaned into my ear and her hips started pushing again against me. I felt her body tighten against me and felt her legs start to wrap around me, she was getting closer.</p> <p>I pulled back just a little and pushed all the way into her again. I held myself very still, letting her hold my body as she had before, just letting her get used to the feeling of having me inside her. Her arms went around me, pulling me to her, pinning me to her. I felt my nipples rub against her as her pussy slid against me and she let out a gasp. I couldn't hold it anymore.</p> <p>"I can't," I said out loud and leaned down and kissed her. It still felt wonderful, but I was afraid that I was going to make her orgasm and it had gone from something wonderful to something, but it felt right. Her hands went to my face, holding me to her. She kissed me as hard and strong as she had kissed me in her own mind.</p> <p>"Oh, yes ... yes," she said. She started grinding her hips harder against me. I put my hands on her hips to steady myself and slid them inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
