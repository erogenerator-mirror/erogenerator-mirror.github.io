I mused. "I could go all day if one of that big thing's there. Not that I want you to go, but I would like to know your preference.</p> <p>"You know, it would be so easy." She whispered.</p> <p>"What's 'Easy?'" I asked. "The only thing that'll work is if you just use them on me. It's my fantasy."</p> <p>"I think... I think I'll have to change it." She said, taking a bite of her own meal. She licked her lips.</p> <p>"That sounds really good. I was just gonna eat a bit of the omelet, if'n I got a chance." I teased. "There." I picked up the omelet and tossed it on the bed. "Eat up, I'm gonna get this steak for us."</p> <p>"Mmmm, I love you." she said simply and then fell asleep.</p> <p>I was having a fine time.</p> <p>Later on, I slipped on a pair of shorts and a t-shirt with little yellow polka dots on the bottom and wandered the mall for the food on the way.</p> <p>"What did you decide over here this afternoon?" I asked.</p> <p>"I thought you would." she smiled. "It's too bad there isn't one of those big enough places that have a real buffet."</p> <p>"Oh yeah, they have a table there, right by the window." I pointed.</p> <p>"I don't know if I am hungry or not this morning." she said as she sat the plate away from the counter. She turned her back to me to look back at me while chewing on that food. I leaned over to whisper in her ear. "Just take that one and eat it." she whispered back.</p> <p>"The place is all filled out." I said, taking another bite.</p> <p>"You are such a sweetie." Lisa said as she walked out of the doorway.</p> <p>"I think I would be eating a pretty healthy breakfast." she said when I had finished my steak. She turned around to look at me with that serious look.</p> <p>"Hey, you're eating a bit more." she laughed. "You know, you can always come up with a little more!" she continued with a naughty grin. "What do you say we go get some breakfast?"</p> <p>"What's up, Lisa?" I asked.</p> <p>"Just let me get to the bathroom." she said, turning around. She was almost touching me on the neck, but she was too far away. I stood up as she leaned back against the mirror. She didn't want me to fall and get a little tickled.</p> <p>"I don't have to get up for anything." I told her. "It's just nice to be able to sit with someone who enjoys eating."</p> <p>"Thank you for letting me." she replied. "I've never even taken a break from you before. I think the meal and the food were just the thing to get me in the mood."</p> <p>I grabbed her hand and guided her toward the restroom. She pulled back enough to take a step away from me, which opened her legs wide. She leaned back against the counter, her hips lifted and she had a hand on hers. "I could go again if you're nice, then." She said with a smile.</p> <p>"You're all worked up aren't you?" I teased.</p> <p>"Honey, it's been so long." she laughed.</p> <p>"It sure has. Just like when we were in the shower." I laughed.</p> <p>"So, are you going to let me see you again?" she giggled as I looked down at the floor.</p> <p>"Well, I guess I'm not too much of a tease, right?" she asked with a wink. By that time, we were both breathing hard.</p> <p>We started to go into the restroom, but stopped. "It's not as hot as it was before." I said. Lisa pulled her skirt down and looked into my eyes.</p> <p>"I was going to say we stop at the bathroom." she laughed. She started to back up and I stopped her. "Just turn around."</p> <p>"Okay." She said. She turned around and saw me looking. She leaned in, putting her hand on the urinal to stop me.</p> <p>"Well, if you are sure about this." I teased.</p> <p>"What?" she asked.</p> <p>"It's just I have always believed men, especially in men, to be honest." I said.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" Lisa asked.</p> <p>"Just let me tell you what goes on in here. I'm going to give you a little privacy. And I'm going to give you aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
