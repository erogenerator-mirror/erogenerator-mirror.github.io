I think I'm ready to call it off now."</p> <p>Lori looked sad too. "We can't - we could never do that."</p> <p>I hugged her. "I really have no desire for that now. I think that we can get past this with or without a little persuasion."</p> <p>She smiled and kissed me. "I thought you said you were ready to do that? I know you're not. You just don't know."</p> <p>"I do." I said.</p> <p>"I think that's a beautiful thing to say, though." I laughed. "We aren't ready for the whole 'you might not want the whole thing yet, and I might not want to do it so, well, I can guess." She smiled and looked down her nose. "I'm sorry if I've got your hopes up for you, I'm probably too eager about it to be happy about it."</p> <p>I smiled and said, "Just go to bed now. Get up and go to sleep. I'll call when I fall asleep." She just looked at me with her face in her hands, and we hugged again. She was almost shaking when I kissed her gently on the lips. "I think I'll just get into bed."</p> <p>But not before we both heard the clock go off.</p> <p>CHAPTER 3 -- THE TALK</p> <p>"I am glad you came to that conference," I said, and then she nodded. "Now?"</p> <p>"Yes, now. You should take that opportunity to have a good experience. That doesn't mean anything to me, but I need to take it a step further. You should have a little fun in the meantime, like on vacation." Lori nodded and sat up. "I am not that old," she said, looking down at her shoes, "and a lot of fun to be having. I've just always had a thing for you and that made me happy. I also have to admit that you are not as beautiful as you first thought, but it still seems like fun." So I told her how I felt.</p> <p>"And you are always open and honest with me." She smiled.</p> <p>"Thanks," I said. "Sometimes, I wish I could have seen you like that." Then when she said something, I looked up again, and we held each other.</p> <p>"I suppose that means anything," Lori said. "Do you think that you can be honest and open about a lot of things, like having a girl try to make you happy and not just one man trying to make you happy?"</p> <p>"Maybe," I said. "I was not going there at all. It is what it is and what we have been doing, but I'm not sure that it would ever be what you are thinking right now."</p> <p>Lori nodded. "So I can be anything you want me to be. You could be my boyfriend, my best friend, my girlfriend who loves me totally," she told me. "Do a lot of things I would be a little awkward doing, and I could use a guy friend, but it wouldn't be that much different. And, of course, I would be pretty open to it, you know, and it's been great for us." She giggled. "I don't really know what to say."</p> <p>"I told you that we're going to have fun, and I promise you will enjoy it," I said. I smiled, and I knew that there was just a little bit of hope left in her. "Come on," I said again and she stood up and we hugged again, then kissed. Then, to my surprise, she gave me a little peck on the lips, just enough to bring my cock back to life. And then we went to bed. Chapter 4 -- A New Day</p> <p>I'm sure that we both slept well that day. I hadn't slept well the night before, and I could hardly stand it if I could. When I did wake up, Lori was wearing a pretty negligee, and although some of the clothes in my wardrobe would have been very much nicer worn in another room, I really couldn't resist a peek at her. She looked very enticing in that outfit, and I got a very hard erection the very first time she got ready for the party. Lori was wearing thigh-high black stockings which had a red seam running up them, and she had on her sexy pink high heels, and that was just to make certain. She has long, shapely legs that she wears when she's dancing at a very elegant house, and her shapely ass was very clear to eye right up to those stocking encased legs. The top of her negligee clung to those generous breasts, giving me aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
