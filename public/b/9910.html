I understand. I really do."</p> <p>She laughed.</p> <p>"I'm sorry about that."</p> <p>"It's okay. I think a lot of people are embarrassed to say that."</p> <p>"I get it, don't I? We're all kids sometimes."</p> <p>"Yes, I'm that."</p> <p>"So, I can change. It's been a long week."</p> <p>"Do you do this often?"</p> <p>"I'm not that big."</p> <p>"I thought it did. I'm still an undergrad."</p> <p>"Me too," she said, rubbing her foot against my thigh.</p> <p>"You can come see me next week."</p> <p>She laughed. "Can I ask you something? You're an undergrad too?"</p> <p>She was so beautiful.</p> <p>"What is it? Are you interested in me?"</p> <p>"Wow. You look good. I haven't had a chance to compliment you."</p> <p>She shook her head.</p> <p>"Maybe I do look good," she said.</p> <p>"Is there a girl you would like to date?"</p> <p>She laughed.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"No? Are you with your parents?"</p> <p>I laughed, trying to get her to laugh with me.</p> <p>"We both live in different states," I said, "so we can't talk about it in college."</p> <p>"Oh, and I want to kiss you."</p> <p>I laughed, and she moved her feet closer together.</p> <p>"So you wanna ask me about being with a girl."</p> <p>She laughed. "That was a joke."</p> <p>"Oh, no. Are you ready to ask me again?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Do we kiss?"</p> <p>"Well, we won't know until later," I replied.</p> <p>She smiled.</p> <p>"That's sweet."</p> <p>"So I don't have to wear a condom?"</p> <p>"No, it's clean," I lied. "But..."</p> <p>"Why don't you tell me so it's safe?" she asked.</p> <p>I thought about that for a second. I could be lying. It was still a risk, but I would never think of doing it again, even as excited as she wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
