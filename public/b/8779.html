His left arm wrapped around me and his head rested on my shoulder. His left hand caressed my back as his right hand cupped my left boob, the thumb gently massaging my nipple.</p> <p>The feeling was electric and I began to breath deeper, trying to control my moans. He must have sensed my heightened state of arousal because while taking stock, he kissed my neck and my shoulders and then lifted my right arm away from my body and gently wrapped it round his neck. The feel of my arms encircling him brought a warm feeling down to my tummy and I moved against his hardness with each movement he made. He was holding me so tightly, that it seemed as though we were one giant being; it seemed we could fit me better than any one had ever gone before - we were as deeply intimate as we had been last night. I felt myself begin to build towards my release and this time I had to wait, wanting nothing but to feel his body inside of me as he reached his. My hips were now gyrating to the rhythm of his thrusts and I could feel my juices running down the inside of my thigh, which he had made slick with his own, and I instinctively pushed further along his shaft, which he had found to be much larger than the other two I had previously experienced. My movements were too slow and I gasped at his strength which was all my strength.</p> <p>He suddenly pulled me onto him, and I felt the weight of his body on me as our kiss was returned, his hand running along my body and then back down again, over my boob and up my rib cage and his hand caressing one of my nipples. He moved himself on top of me, still thrusting himself into my body, and I felt him moving towards my lips. I took my lips from his and he slowly slid his body over mine, kissing my lips and then running his hands along my body. I didn't know what was happening - I had always felt like I should be enjoying the sensation of being filled in all of the places and emotions I most wanted to be happy. I felt a moment of doubt as this would be a moment when I was finally going to be satisfied but once again, the reality of the situation took over; my body seemed to have been reduced by a single thought and desire. I felt my mind begin to go dizzy, as I started to hyperventilate. He was still inside of me when I felt an electric shock, that was followed by a gush, as my body became electrified. He was right in front of me and I was holding myself up against him as he came down and ground his hips into mine, not moving at all for a moment but instead trying to stay firmly implanted in me. Our breathing gradually slowed and I felt his hands on my stomach, starting to slide downwards, which I assumed meant that he was holding himself up by grabbing at my waist. It felt as though he was trying to make himself more solid before he finally pulled out, before he lifted himself off of me, and once again, my lips were on mine, just as we have done so many times, where I am supposed to be with this man...</p> <p>It seems I have been in his company far longer than just now. I have felt much more than one person I now know to be the complete person I never could be as I have always felt like I did while lying beside a man, or even on my back and being penetrated by a man whilst being watched by another woman which felt as real, as though I was watching one woman with her legs over another's shoulders whilst being penetrated by another man. To this day I can still feel myself wanting this woman and as I've said, the last of that was probably the night of my greatest sexual experience. Yet, she will never know who is fucking her for me, and when I think of that night and again, I wonder if all I could possibly be that special. But I will, will Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
