Then she pushed on each knee that were resting on the arms of the sofa; her legs wide apart in readiness to be used by her Master.</p> <p>As the music stopped, she felt the hand on her left leg move upwards and then slowly slide between the lips of her sex and into her depths. The tempo returned to it's previous level and with it, the hand stroking her body moved towards a climax of a different level. The effect was to move her entire body almost instantly to the beat of the song's chorus and then back towards the edge again.</p> <p>She came and came again more powerfully than before, her juices running down the inside edge of her thighs even with the heel of her foot pressing on it through the stocking.</p> <p>A short while later, she collapsed onto her sofa and looked up at the ceiling. Nothing had happened since she had climaxed the previous night; perhaps, the music had stopped. Or perhaps it was simply that she had stopped wearing the top stocking top, or perhaps she had simply slipped it off. Certainly this could only be the case; her husband may not be a considerate lover and certainly that was not possible, but surely she didn't object. Perhaps it would be all right.</p> <p>Her whole body was in turmoil. She wanted to reach out and touch herself, but there were no men or anything that could take that from her so suddenly. As she stood up she felt the heel and heel of both her hands rubbing against her breasts. Her knees trembled but also, if the music had continued to play, her knees bent.</p> <p>The hand inside her vagina was soon sliding back and forth inside her again as the music continued its hypnotic beat. This time the tempo was at least equal to the one at her front leg. The hand slid inside her sex again, this time only in a way that gave her a brief pause. The hand inside of her left hand found her clitoris and moved it to a different beat. She felt a wave of ecstasy crash through her and she exploded again. The hand inside her vagina was now massaging her clitoris hard enough against her thighs to give her the feeling of it as her orgasm crashed through her.</p> <p>Exhausted, she slumped forward onto the sofa and turned sideways onto her left hand, lying flat. Her right foot sank on top of her, the heel pressed firmly against her clit. Only the second finger inside her vagina was still active inside her, the two curled up inside her again. She lay quietly until she found the words to continue pleasuring herself. "I will need at least another minute or so to come."</p> <p>"As long as it lasts, Master. As a reminder. A reminder to please you."</p> <p>The words just happened to have a profound effect on her. Without stopping, she felt herself moving, rising and lowering her body slowly before settling down on to it once more. It was impossible to be left out and she could not tell if she was floating on a cloud or was in a place.</p> <p>Suddenly, she remembered the first time she had received a massage. The first time she had been with a man, her first time since coming to bed. The first time, for her, it was with a man, a man like her husband, a man like whom she would remember. Her first time and the first time again and she felt the intense joy as her head slipped down between his legs as his hands took her and moved her from front to back. Again, not her first time as the second time only just the moment before in the bed, before moving again to the rear, to her rear, where she had enjoyed her first woman's fingers there more than a few weeks before. She felt her hips lift and then her body lift again as she realised the excitement she enjoyed at this moment.</p> <p>Almost without thinking she looked down between her legs and saw a man there at her rear, lying on his back. His hand was in her sex and she could see the hand between his legs touching on its shaft. Without thinking, she began to masturbate him, but he told her to stop as she began again in a little bit of rhythm. Again he told her to stop as he began to move in a motion similar to what he had done to her at that particular moment before, but this time instead of moving up and down instead, his hand stopped in her sex and continued on that motion. It repeated in his hands several times each time until he took it away.</p> <p>She realised that this had made her so aroused as she had never thought she could become. Perhaps after her climax, when she felt she could go some time perhaps she would go to sleep.
