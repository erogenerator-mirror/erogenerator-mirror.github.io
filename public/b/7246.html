You were still rubbing my clit through the thin cloth of the panties, caressing it as I was touching you and stroking you with my pussy.</p> <p>Your hands were now exploring under the material of my panties to my ass, and your hand brushed my pussy from underneath against the tight cloth of my dress. Our kissing seemed to intensify, and all of a sudden you pulled off your panties and took off your dress.</p> <p>As your panties came off, you spread yourself down onto the couch, with your legs spread apart, your arms stretched out over your head, and your ass towards me.</p> <p>I had the front of my panties down around my ankle now, just as you'd done when I was on my back, and you slid it right to my ankles. I was so hot and horny looking at you while you were doing that.</p> <p>You took off the rest of your panties, and started to rub your clit against me as you stroked yourself. I put one hand up under your chin so that I could look into your eyes as you touched yourself. I put my foot down on the couch, and the other hand up under my legs to hold my pussy in place for you.</p> <p>You took your clit lightly from my heel to let me rub it on you, and then pulled it away for more stimulation. I knew your pussy was so wet that you were already about ready to climax, and I made sure that I stayed ready to come too as much as I wanted.</p> <p>You pulled off that strap on and held it against your left breast as you stroked yourself, keeping your eyes locked on mine. One hand cupped your right breast, while the other hand circled your clit while you stroked yourself.</p> <p>My heart was racing and I was aching to have you between my legs, and I knew it would only be a matter of seconds before I came if there was any chance that I could come. That would be too soon, and it would be too quick.</p> <p>I wanted you to have yourself just a few inches away.</p> <p>"Come for me," you said.</p> <p>"Please."</p> <p>"Come," you told me. "Now come!"</p> <p>That was all I needed.</p> <p>And I came on the couch.</p> <p>At first I thought I was going to pass out, but you wrapped the dildo against my thighs and pressed the tip in. I thought that I was going to be thrown off by the sensation of the rubber cock. It felt even better though, and the fact that it was going in so deeply was all that I could really focus on was that the whole thing was inside me already.</p> <p>You pushed until the tip of it had worked itself up to the bottom of my pussy, and pushed some more. It went all the way in easily, and I gave a small gasp when you did it. Your eyes were closed, your head was back, and you were completely relaxed. I could see everything now. Your hair was wet against the back of your head and you were staring straight at my breasts, your neck and your eyes, which were smiling into one another, and the dildo, which had started to press back towards me in a most pleasurable way again, which was a combination of all the pleasure I had experienced with you. A combination of the sex I just got from your hands and your fingers and your pussy, and the sensation from my feet on the couch and the feeling of the dildo going in and out of me. You were the one having the most fun.</p> <p>It was more than I could resist. And I knew it.</p> <p>Just a little bit longer.</p> <p>I let myself just lay there on you, with the dildo still half inside me. I layed my head back down on the couch and pulled you closer to me, and put my arms under you now. You were sitting with my back pressed against the wall and my head on your lap. We were both breathing heavily, and our chest rising and falling rhythmically. Your hands found mine, and then they were on your breasts, with your nipples like little pebbles. My hands were on your shoulders, but I couldn't hold myself down while you continued to stroke yourself. It felt wonderful. I was just about ready to come myself.</p> <p>"Come for me now," you said. "I want to watch you come. You can hold yourself up a while."</p> <p>I felt better then.</p> <p>I'm not sure how long you were playing with my breasts or how long it was taking. Or how long, if you were really counting, I don't know, maybe ten minutes.</p> <p>At the same time, I still felt like one half of you was going inside me and the other half wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
