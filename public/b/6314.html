"Well, I was born... well, I was born in the time of the human race... I think... not far back... you remember? Yes, I did remember. I remember... from long ago..."</p> <p>"Yes, I remember. You were born about fifteen years ago. I was born about six, a little late... some would say a little too late..."</p> <p>"Please, please call me Mandy. I'm so pleased to hear that you felt comfortable enough to hear it."</p> <p>"It's easy to forget my past... now, how about you? So, what happened to your family to get to you? The same as me I mean!"</p> <p>"It is hard to forget you," I said with a smile. "I was born a little short, and then suddenly my parents were kicked out of home. I've gone where no one has gone. I was born at six weeks, and was taken to the same country where my parents were kicked out of. That's where I met... and where my family comes from... what is this country you're from?"</p> <p>Mandy blushed and asked, "Do you know this country?"</p> <p>I shook my head and shook my head at the same time, "Yes, for a little while now... just you... this country."</p> <p>"I like that place too. It's actually a very private kind of place in winter and... it's quite private here in the winter. In my mother's family it was their little home to me... we lived in it, mostly hidden away but still close enough to the city, very close enough to the other people here that they knew them and no one else would see them... they'd have a hard time keeping them in when... as they got older and got wiser. There are few people of importance on the other side, most of the other kids here look down upon them... even when the children learn who they are... they look at them more as siblings than as people really. But most of them look away at those around them... they have an inferiority complex in comparison to you, at least in relation to everyone else in your social circle. But I guess in this country it's not a disadvantage, it's a natural, natural place to live, for the people in that place are very beautiful, and... I'd almost say most people wouldn't even attempt to look at you... I can get away with that," I said with a laugh, "but I would, if I had the chance."</p> <p>"My father was a bit of a loner back in our day... his name was George... he wanted to be a big name and run the country... but he was the eldest child of the town... and a large, strong one at that. Everyone at the village had a bit of an image of him... my parents thought so too... for it was in their culture of being a small boy... 'Little George', well, what you would call 'little George' is more like 'Little George'..."</p> <p>Mandy smiled and looked at me again, running her fingers through my hair, then kissing again. "I remember how you made me feel when you called..." She looked so happy, at last, and I smiled softly.</p> <p>"You did that for me too?"</p> <p>"Yes, of course," she said in response, "I didn't know what else to do with my mouth."</p> <p>"I'm glad you enjoyed it."</p> <p>"Oh, it was so nice."</p> <p>"Are you ready to go?"</p> <p>"Oh yes, let's go." Mandy and I went downstairs to the truck she owned. When we got there we just parked right in front and hopped out. We got in right there in the drive of the truck, right next to one another; Mandy with her right arm around me and my arms stretched out around her waist.</p> <p>We got to the truck and turned left, and she put her right leg up on my knee and gave me a kiss on the cheek, and the hand under my skirt slipped in my slit, and then into my moist panties, cupping my ass and pulling me towards her. I spread my legs for her and she pushed her fingers into my cunt through the thin nylon and massaged my g-spot. I was gasping softly when Mandy gave my cunt a good tongue lick, and then sucked on my clit, sending vibrations up and down my body, like little electric jolts that made my vagina quiver for a second or two, before I collapsed in laughter and giggled again.</p> <p>We drove for about half an hour around the countryside on the way back to the town. Her hand stroked my cheekâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
