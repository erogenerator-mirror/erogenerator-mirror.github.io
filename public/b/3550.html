Beth had already taken me in her mouth, so I didn't know where she was going with this. She slowly lowered herself onto the head of my dick. Her pussy was on fire, wet, sticky and hot to the touch. It almost hurt when she slid down my pole so slow, but she was making it the way I wanted. Finally, she stopped to look down her body at me, then she smiled and licked her own pussy juice off my lips.</p> <p>The look in her eye said much of the world to me – love, lust, and love. Beth's whole body was tense, her tits were rising and falling, the lips of her pussy were drawn back, and my dick felt like it was in a vise. The head had slid over the top of her clit, and she let out a small moan. I pushed up in her pussy to give the head of my dick some room. God, she felt good.</p> <p>Beth lowered herself with long, slow strokes onto me. Her hands held on to my upper arms as she slowly bounced on my cock. The sensation was too good to be true, so I told her.</p> <p>"Baby, you are so tight."</p> <p>"I'm glad you like it. I'm almost there." And she bounced faster, her mouth open, staring at me as she slammed herself down on me. It looked like she was trying to fit my entire cock inside her, and all of the effort was just to get it in. I tried to push on her breasts, but they were trapped and in a way it felt like I was trapped in the same way.</p> <p>I finally got it in and said, "Keep going. Just a little more, please. I can't hold back any longer."</p> <p>"I promise. I promise." Beth moaned and smiled.</p> <p>The feeling was intense and I was so full again, but she had been riding me for over a minute, and she had my whole cock in her up to the root. I could feel the veins that had been standing out were going to burst by now. Beth started to bounce faster, not in a hurry, she just did it slowly. My cock was twitching inside of her, and every time she looked down, I could see a small part of my head was inside her. Her pussy was gripping my dick so tightly. Beth closed her eyes and came. Her whole body jolted. She fell forward, my arms around her, and her hair fell over my face. My hands held her body against me. I felt so good.</p> <p>We held each other for several moments, my dick resting in her warm, slick, wet pussy. Then she started moving and rolling her hips against me to get the best angle with which I could feel her. We remained like that for several moments, catching our breath, and just enjoying the moment together.</p> <p>"You are good, Baby," I told her.</p> <p>"I have never felt so good," she told me. "Your dick is so beautiful."</p> <p>We fell into a comfortable silence. We were both lost in the moment, and a little bit of that reality that we were both doing, but were not aware.</p> <p>Finally, Beth spoke. "I'm gonna take a shower. I'm hungry."</p> <p>"You'll need to get out a room. I'll go get us a wine." I stood up and took off my clothes. Beth sat up and looked at me before saying, "Get dressed, Baby. I'll be right back."</p> <p>She got ready for me and went into the guest room when I got dressed. She went downstairs to get the towel, when I came back in with a big grin. When I pulled the towel off, Beth said, "That felt really good."</p> <p>"I had a feeling," I told her. "What else you're doing today."</p> <p>"There haven't been any things else."</p> <p>"Then you have a really nice time."</p> <p>"Yes, I think I do." And she smiled at me when she said that. We sat down on the couch, naked and I found it almost amusing how much pleasure I was having. We kissed for a long time, then I got up to shower and change clothes. Then we went upstairs and had some serious fun, both of us naked, but very close together, playing with each others body parts. Both of us were so happy with the experience we had taken of being, so happy and intimate with each other and, at least to begin with, the sex. We took turns getting dressed, just as Beth put it we should do this every morning or we would never get the chance to again. We knew we couldn—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
