I'm starving."</p> <p>After a quick shower, the rest of the week started off just fine. Emily didn't go anywhere. She didn't eat or drink much, and she never seemed to be eating a thing. Her hair was a mess, but she looked good, and when she was in the mood for it, well, she still looked good. Every other day was torture. The day after she got in the shower, she would shower and think for a second, then get out and be ready to go. She usually did, before going to bed.</p> <p>She thought about what she was going to wear: a tee shirt, a pair of jeans and a sweater, and she thought that she didn't want to take anything other than a top that she should have left in the bathroom. She wondered just how lucky her folks were. They would have gotten used to her at 18 years old, and with all her brothers and dad having been older, it wouldn't be a thing to be concerned for her. As far as she could tell, they had always been close to her. Even as little as she used to be, they had always been there, in the same room together, and had always treated her right. Now, she thought, with their kids grown, they might still think that she had taken the time to grow. She wondered what her parents would think if she did. She certainly wondered what they would think if they knew that she was still a virgin. She wondered what they would think if they knew that they had her, only to be rejected.</p> <p>Her last couple of days were the most exciting of her life. She didn't bother with the clothes she was going to wear. She didn't even think about the time that she was staying at their school, and she didn't mind that she had gone to bed early that night - at least not with her bed partner. There were no sheets, or blankets, nothing. She didn't even bother to go to bed early. She was so tired, and she just couldn't focus. She needed to get to sleep, and was hoping that she would be there early, because she could get into bed and sleep in the middle of the night instead of just lying there.</p> <p>Emily felt terrible. She wanted to cry, and she had never cried since she was six, and although it seemed to be easier to do it at home, sometimes, at times, it was more embarrassing. It was always in the bathroom, because mom usually didn't get home at 6.</p> <p>When she got up, to her delight, she walked into her room and saw a note on the pillow: "Emily, you have a long night to get to."</p> <p>Before she headed out, she decided to put on a pair of the panties that she had been wearing when she had gotten ready to go to bed. She turned to the mirror on the back of the closet and checked her face. She still had the makeup on.</p> <p>Just then, there was a knock on her door. Emily looked over to see who it would be. Of course, she was surprised. Usually the knocking came at least six minutes ago. There was no answer.</p> <p>"Mom doesn't have the time to worry about me, but Dad might," she thought. "I think that I might just as well get ready, and I'll be ready in a few minutes."</p> <p>She went into the bathroom and closed the door. She slipped her robe on and went to the kitchen for a glass of water, then went to bed. She was still naked as a daisy (although she thought that she must have fallen asleep). When she went to bed, she still had her t-shirt on, and had to wear this. She got into bed, pulled the sheet back over herself, and closed her eyes. She felt so good, so free, and yet at the same time, she also still had to be tired to go back to sleep.</p> <p>She slept almost non-stop that night.</p> <p>When she woke up, she was in her own bed, and the light was still on. She could see in there one of the guest rooms that they had been at before. She could see that they were still in bed. She wanted to look at it. She wanted to know why they had stayed. Why could they leave? They were still there, they had stayed.</p> <p>That was exactly the moment that she sat up. As she sat there, she could see that she had nothing on under the sheet.</p> <p>She looked down at herself, and she had a weird lump in her throat. She wanted to say to herself that they had stayed, but she was afraid to.</p> <p>"My name is Emily, and this is my room," she said. "This is the guest bedroom. This is yours."</p> <p>That was it. She felt that feeling ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
