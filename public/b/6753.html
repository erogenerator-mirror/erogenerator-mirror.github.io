She answered and then she started to get ready.</p> <p>"So," She called after me.</p> <p>"So?"</p> <p>"What's got into you?"</p> <p>"Can't tell. How about you?"</p> <p>"Oh I just got off."</p> <p>"I can't believe it."</p> <p>Looking up at the bedroom ceiling, she looked over her shoulder and smiled for a bit.</p> <p>"I'll be back." She said and then she was out the door.</p> <p>She came back the next morning at breakfast.</p> <p>"Hi honey," She said, hugging me. "You're home. I'm ready to go."</p> <p>"Yep," she said, still smiling. "Want to come downstairs for a cup of coffee and you can tell me all about it?"</p> <p>I didn't say anything but I agreed. I went down to her room at the end of the hall and we went down to her kitchen. Mom already had a pot boiling in the frig and she was looking through a rack of coffee mugs. I went to help her and she set the cup of coffee on the counter before I sat beside her.</p> <p>"Hi," I said.</p> <p>"Hi," she answered and then she smiled. "I'm not really surprised that you were gone but I just found out that you were the only son of Jenny and I figured you were out looking for someone."</p> <p>"I'm not looking for a new wife," I answered with a smile.</p> <p>"Nonsense!" she responded, "I think I'm just gonna find someone else that would fit your needs. She's going to be the best mother a girl could ever hope for."</p> <p>"What about me?"</p> <p>"Don't you worry about me. Just think of it as your house."</p> <p>She went on, "I'm glad you're home so soon."</p> <p>"I don't think that's a fair point," I said, "I mean your momma is really good with kids so it's a perfect neighborhood. Mom's my wife."</p> <p>"Well I guess you got that right, huh?"</p> <p>"Yes indeed," I agreed.</p> <p>After breakfast I told her of my visit and she gave me a hug and a soft kiss.</p> <p>"Good morning," she said," I'm so glad it's finally over."</p> <p>"Yeah, it's over," I agreed," I know. Now it's just gonna take a while to get through this but it's my hope that you'll be here in the future. I have a feeling that you'll become even more important to me than just the son I had."</p> <p>"Yeah, I know that," she said, smiling, "I have no doubt about that."</p> <p>"Just remember that," I said and she smiled. "Remember our family thing?"</p> <p>"Yeah right!" she said as we sat around the kitchen table sipping coffee.</p> <p>"You know what we haven't done since we got together last fall."</p> <p>"I know," she said, "but it's been too long."</p> <p>"I know," I said with a grin, "maybe it's time for something more."</p> <p>"Yeah," she agreed, "that was my idea too last night."</p> <p>"What was my idea?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh, well," she smiled and said, "I guess that you have to give me a blow job now."</p> <p>I had no problem with her offering to give me a blowjob but I didn't want sex this morning. I told her to take her top off as I wanted her to get undressed in front of me. She was reluctant but she got the message and stood up as she undid her skirt. I looked down at her gorgeous body as I picked up one of the cups of kitchen sink and bent forward to start washing.</p> <p>"Here, give me that," I said as I pulled the cup up and off of the end table.</p> <p>I wrapped my hand around the base of the soft cotton and slowly started to work it down her body. I felt her skin and then ran my hand through her hair as I worked the cup around the base of her head. She smiled as I made her head turn towards me as I lifted the cup to her lips, lowering my head towards her.</p> <p>She reached out her body as she reached out and put her hands in mine to give me access to her pussy. I bent my head down as far as I could as my head made contact with the soft skin of her inner thigh then I reached up and pulled the cup down, dropping the cup to its original position.</p> <p>I looked up at her just as my tongue touched the soft skin of her left outer lip.
