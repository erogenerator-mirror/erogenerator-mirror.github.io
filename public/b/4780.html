Your parents are very nice, and I love them dearly"</p> <p>He said "I've told them about your husband and what a wonderful relationship you've had, and how wonderful your sex life with me has been, and they've agreed to come visit. They know that you are on all four sexed out to get the best. I can't get much better sex from them than yours! Do you have any objections?"</p> <p>"I don't think so! You're right, it sounds fantastic!"</p> <p>When he had settled down for a few moments we went into discussion about things we would like to do. He asked me if I still wanted to go with his family. He made me sign a bunch of stuff. He said, "I'll bring you a couple of things when you come back."</p> <p>I wondered how I could go through it without being embarrassed. My marriage came tumbling down around my ears. I knew better. I didn't want to go through any more humiliation. I decided to be open and clear with him in every single thing.</p> <p>After we had finished the food and were just settling down to watch the weather on the TV, he sat next to me and said "I hope we have a lot of fun with you and I in the future, and that you'll be happy that I've had you as my wife for a long, long time!"</p> <p>I asked "Why?"</p> <p>"I'm happy that you have me in your household. I really get off watching you and I don't expect to ever forget it!"</p> <p>We finished our meal and went back to the living room.</p> <p>He looked at me. "You're not leaving tonight, are you?" he asked.</p> <p>"No, never,"</p> <p>He sat with me and I tried to put my life back together, but he put his arm around me and gently squeezed me.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, honey", he said to me with sincerity, "I don't deserve to have you in my life. You don't deserve anything other than my love for you!"</p> <p>"I'm not so little anymore," I said, "In fact, I thought you could do better than your parents! I have no idea how long since I had my first time, but I know that I can do better!"</p> <p>My answer got him a big grin. He pulled me closer and kissed me. I was surprised at first. I just felt a lot better when I was with him. It was kind of a turn off, I think. I told myself it was better to get what ever he wanted than to do it at a disadvantage. He kept going and kissing me. Finally, we kissed and he put his hand on my thigh, between my legs, and he could feel how wet I was. I thought he was going to stroke me to an orgasm right there on the couch. I stopped him, and he whispered, "No. I want you to touch me."</p> <p>"I'm not going to stop you!" I replied. He squeezed my leg and I shuddered. His hand stopped, and I looked at him.</p> <p>"No. I want you to keep going."</p> <p>"Well, do you want me to play with you?"</p> <p>"Yes!" I exclaimed.</p> <p>He began kissing down my neck while his other hand found my breast and began to cup it.</p> <p>"What you did to your husband," I said quietly, "I can't, you know."</p> <p>"But you let me, and you let me touch you," he murmured. He took me into his arms and we kissed again. I put my arms around his neck and he held me tight. As I felt him starting to get turned on, I could not help but begin to put my leg between his and rub it against his crotch. He rubbed my leg up and down over his cock.</p> <p>"I'm not the only one with a hard cock", I thought, "so lets make him hard for me! We can go to the bathroom afterwards."</p> <p>He began to kiss down my stomach and he was kissing my pubic area again. I was glad it was dark, because his kisses were going straight to my clit and then up towards my bellybutton. It took me a couple of minutes to reach my second orgasm, but it was worth it! I told him about it when we got out of the shower. He was excited as well. It seemed like the first time in a long time for us!</p> <p>My husband's cock was hard and I needed relief.</p> <p>He wanted to fuck me, and he wanted to fuck me as I sucked him. I liked that idea.</p> <p>He pulled off his shorts, and I put down my robe and my body was already wet from the rain in the bathroom.</p> <p>I knelt on the soft terryclothâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
