Listen, if you like what I've seen last night, I'd love to watch you again."</p> <p>"I'm not sure...."</p> <p>"Don't you like it?"</p> <p>"I...don't know."</p> <p>I turned and walked out again and as I passed her mother I waved and said, "I'll be back."</p> <p>"No, don't. We should talk."</p> <p>I turned back and walked into her room, walked over to the window and looked out into the parking lot. She was sitting on a lawn chair, naked, sitting on her own patio...the window was open and all of the lights were on. Her hands were tied under the desk, and she was bent over, knees spread, and her hands, tied together, held in front of her, with her hands under her. Her eyes were closed. She had her pussy lips spread out and up her legs and her dark brown eyes were half-closed. I could see she was enjoying the moment, I could almost feel it. As I looked at her I said quietly, "I love you, Katie. No way I'm turning you down for sex. I'll see you later, right now."</p> <p>"Thank you." She said with one of her soft, satisfied sigh's and pulled the chair back and sat while I stood up and walked to her. I sat down next to her in the armchair, facing her and looked her square in the eye. "Are you ok?"</p> <p>"I'm pretty turned on. I just...have been kind of...ready for a long time now." She said with her face close, touching my face in her fingers.</p> <p>I reached over and touched her arm and slowly pulled her away from the desk and sat down next to her. I asked her how she felt and saw she was still pretty tired.</p> <p>"I guess it's been awhile. Is it ok if I go have a bath?" I wondered what it was that made her feel so tired.</p> <p>"Yes, go ahead. I'm not really in any condition to drive." She said.</p> <p>I pulled her and brought her up into my arms. I hugged her tight and started kissing her neck. She put her arms around my neck as I did this. I kissed her ears, her neck and shoulders. I could feel her pussy starting to get moist. Her head was on my shoulder. I started to get a little aggressive, pushing her back a little as the tip of my tongue moved slowly down her neck until I felt her breath catch. I let her take a breath and continued kissing her neck as her back arched and she pushed back into my arms. She let out soft, quiet, almost breathy moans as she felt my lips and tongue moving gently down her neck again. I could tell her nipples were hard with anticipation of my tongue flicking across them, and I kept the kisses very soft. I could have gone on for an hour...I loved the fact that after such a long time of being at home, here we were sharing the pleasures of passion with each other in front of her. I loved to see she was feeling the same and was enjoying it, feeling the same things that we did in just a short while. I continued to move slowly down her neck to her breasts and started rubbing her nipples.</p> <p>Katie opened her eyes and slowly got her hands out of the loops on her hands to see where I was moving. It wasn't her breasts that I was pleasuring. It was her pussy again, almost the exact same height as when I was eating her after she had climaxed from just one or maybe two strokes on it. "My God. What is happening to me?"</p> <p>"Just being inside your body is enough for me and you have a hot body and great breasts. I like looking at your body. It's such a turn-on."</p> <p>Katie still didn't move. Instead she just watched me rub her breasts a little more. I kept rubbing them, feeling her body up, trying to imagine how good they would feel and I felt my cock get very hard under the fabric of my pants. I moved my face back upward, over her breasts and found her nipples again. I started to play with them and kissed them as I did a little work on hers. I felt her body starting to respond by getting more wet and she grabbed my head, put it between her breasts and grabbed my head again.</p> <p>"I'm getting horny. I should be letting you take care of me." She said as she pushed my head away and stood up still looking down at me and smiling. As she moved I pulled her up and turned her back toward me and started kissing her. Her lips were soft and wet with herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
