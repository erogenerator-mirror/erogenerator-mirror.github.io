I stammered. "It's... well, you know... it's not..." I stammered as her lips pressed against mine and her tongue invaded my mouth. I was speechless. She began to grind her hips into mine again as she leaned back against the wall. I was shocked by the forceless feeling as she ground into my hips. I held on to her neck with one hand and squeezed her tit.</p> <p>"Oh God!" I thought. She began to moan and I felt her hands go to my ass and I felt her fingers slide under my shirt and grasp my ass. Her hips rolled in my hands as she kissed me.</p> <p>"Mmm..." I moaned into her lips as her mouth moved closer to my pussy as her hand rubbed over my clit and my knees buckled for a second as my climax overtook me. Her lips were only an inch from my pussy as her finger rubbed over my flesh and as her thumb flicked over my clit again I came on her hand.</p> <p>"Oh God!" I groaned as I shook and trembled, unable to even moan as she slipped her finger in me. Her breath was warm and sexy as she began to slide it in and out. I watched as her tongue flicked against my clit as her hand moved in and out of her pussy. Her fingers were large and the nails were thin as she pumped them in and out of me. I looked up at her eyes and saw her eyes half shut as she kept on rubbing my clit.</p> <p>"Oh God!" I moaned as I came yet again, shaking and shivering as this moment continued. The door flew open and in she slid out first then leaned back against the counter. I looked up at her and she pulled me in for a hug and kissed me so fiercely I think I almost cried. It only made her want to keep me there, to have me in her forever.</p> <p>"So soon?" She murmured, pressing kisses against my cheek.</p> <p>"Soon... oh, soon, my sweet."</p> <p>I just smiled and held her. We both looked into each other's eyes. She leaned her head on my shoulder and kissed my neck.</p> <p>"I love you..." I whispered as my hand slid down the smooth surface of the counter.</p> <p>"I've loved you since the day we met." Her tone was casual and her voice low and seductive.</p> <p>I smiled and pulled her in for a kiss.</p> <p>"Is that so?" I said, tracing the outline of her mouth with my lips.</p> <p>She nodded her head and I pulled back just slightly, dragging the tip of my tongue across her cheeks, then to her chin where I held her in my hand. I traced a line down her neck with my tongue and down along the line of her nipple. She moaned and began to slide her hands through my hair. There was softness in her skin as we kissed and I slid to her shoulders and began the same path that I had done with my tongue over her nipples. I worked the muscles of her neck and shoulders working on the tender nubs of flesh and she began to writhe beneath me as I nipped and kissed her neck and shoulders.</p> <p>"Ohhh..." she moaned, "That feels so good..." She put her arms around me and we kissed again. Her legs trembled and I could feel her wetness on my legs as we kissed. Her body was soft and delicate and her lips were so soft and her smell drove me wild. She pushed the buttons of my blouse with her teeth as her lips teased my nipples and I squealed as her mouth moved down my body to my stomach to my thighs. I let her kiss up my inner thighs and she pressed her hands against my stomach as if searching for my button. She kissed my wet flesh and her tongue came out and circled my navel. She kissed my stomach over and around to my hips where she slipped her hands into my skirt and pulled my skin to the side so she could run her fingers over and over my inner thighs. Her fingers parted my lips and as she pulled on my hood her tongue was a feather and she gently pressed it against my clit. I moaned and her tongue flicked over my clitoris as I was lost in the sensations. I was so wet that she could slip her finger inside me and she began to slide around my clit as she tongued my labia. I reached down and gripped her hand as she ran it down to my ass where I began to pull her pussy against me. She smiled at me and her tongue flicked across my clit. Her fingers slid down to my hole and she began to tease me lightly as her fingers stroked over my hole. I felt myself building as her mouth left my pussy and her fingers ran over my nipplesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
