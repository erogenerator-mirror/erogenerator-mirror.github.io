"If I could bring this pleasure to you, I'd make a thousand dollars just thinking about doing it." He cupped her mound, his hand moving smoothly up and down as he played with her.</p> <p>The pleasure of his fingers was so intense, she didn't know if this was anything she could just allow herself to become. Then that was it. With the orgasm he'd sent her, her body seemed so complete, so complete, and every part of her body that hadn't been touched by its owner. For the first time in her life, she didn't care if she'd had intercourse with a man, but only when he wanted her to. Even when the orgasm ripped through her body.</p> <p>"Thank you," she said. "You've changed my life."</p> <p>"Mmmm . . . I had forgotten how much you'd make me do."</p> <p>Jase stroked her and she felt her passion rising again.</p> <p>"Do me right here. Right now," she said. "Fuck me."</p> <p>That was all it took.</p> <p>Jase lifted her hips onto his cock and his long, thick cock sank into her until she felt like she was completely filled. He stroked her, as if he was trying to find the right tempo. She was so full, so full of him, he could feel her heart beating in time to the strokes he was sliding into her. She didn't know where he had come to. He hadn't even come yet. It was just like this the first time with him when her orgasm overwhelmed her body.</p> <p>His cock seemed to grow even bigger inside her as it stretched her open, then came with a thud. He pulled her onto him and held her. His eyes were fixed on hers, they were so bright, so intense. Then he pushed her onto her back, slid his arms beneath her, lifting her, then pushing all the way into her one smooth motion. She saw stars, felt like electricity, seemed to come from everywhere. She had never experienced anything like this. A feeling of euphoria seemed to be coming from her. The waves of pleasure that rippled from her breasts to her vagina, felt like water in space.</p> <p>He stroked her hair back from her face with a soft, gentle kiss. "That was wonderful," he murmured. "I've never . . .felt anything like it before?"</p> <p>"No. Not ever. You're incredible, sweetie." She turned her head. "And you were wonderful," she murmured.</p> <p>"Do you want a ride?"</p> <p>"God, yes," she said hoarsely. "I want you to come as much as you can. And I can't get enough of you! I want to feel it in me."</p> <p>After about five minutes they moved together, and then moved into each other. With one hand he held her, the other was on her breast, tweaking her nipple and feeling for the first time she did come.</p> <p>Her body was responding by tightening around him, and her hips were arching upward as his cock moved up to slide out. She moaned, and the muscles in her thighs were clenching, signaling a small release. Just a little, she thought, and then relaxed. And as that first squeeze relaxed, she felt him pulling out. She cried out in shock. She felt like she had passed out. They were on the cusp of love. They were not meant to be married. There was just no turning back.</p> <p>And they weren't.</p> <p>"I want to make love to you every day."</p> <p>"Not until we're married."</p> <p>"And you're not going to tell anyone that?"</p> <p>"No. Ever. I want you to tell your friends that you're in love with me forever."</p> <p>"We both know that. Are you going to tell anyone?"</p> <p>"No. No way. But I'm not telling anyone."</p> <p>"Why don't we just do it here, now?"</p> <p>Jase smiled. "I'll get you what you want. I'll come. I'll make love to you till you want it."</p> <p>It seemed to her that they were meant to be in each other's arms, and now it seemed that she did have it. She felt like she was floating, and he seemed to have become the vessel for her pleasure. She kissed his head. Kissed his lips.</p> <p>"I want this, love."</p> <p>That was all he needed. He put her back on to the bed and lifted her ankles to spread her legs.</p> <p>"This is going to feel so hot, so wonderful," he said. "It's almost like we're going to fuck each other until we're dry fucked."</p> <p>Herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
