I could use something to drink, too."</p> <p>Natalie nodded and got up. She made a mental note of the stuff of what she wanted to eat and began looking through the bag again. When she had it complete, she pulled out a chair and sat it next to the sink and set the bag of food down on the floor. She smiled at the food and took a bite of it.</p> <p>"Is it good?" Natalie asked.</p> <p>"It was always good," Carren replied.</p> <p>"Oh, thank God you like it," Natalie remarked. She had known that she would say that but it somehow came out sounding strange to hear it. She felt her stomach knot up and she smiled. It was so nice to hear how the people of this area enjoyed each other's company.</p> <p>"You should get to know the people of this area before you decide to come visit me."</p> <p>"M-maybe that is all right, Natalie." Carren was feeling quite proud of herself.</p> <p>"And I would like to call it by your name," she said. "I would like to call it my lunch time. Is there something else you would like to do?"</p> <p>Natalie blushed and looked at Carren. The way she spoke had her mouth hanging open. She stared into the sink and swallowed a good sized mouthful of food.</p> <p>"Maybe," she sighed. "I might just do that."</p> <p>Natalie took a bite of her burger and savored it. Carren took another bite and chewed on it. With her arms wrapped around Natalie, Carren's mouth came closer to her face. She could feel the soft, pink lips brushing against her cheek. Without taking her gaze off Carren's face, she closed her eyes and pressed her lips against Natalie's. The soft, pliant touch of Natalie's lips made Carren's eyes tear up and feel like warm tears were falling down her cheeks. Her hands slid up to rest on Natalie's narrow waist and they leaned toward each other until the kiss finally broke.</p> <p>"I love you," Carren said before they separated, each looking for the other. "I love you so much."</p> <p>"Me too," Natalie said. "I love you too."</p> <p>Natalie laughed.</p> <p>"I'm glad you came. For whatever you decide to do for dinner, we'll order something together."</p> <p>"I'm so hungry. Where's the bag?"</p> <p>"This is my purse. Put it where your food is supposed to be and bring it here with you when you're ready."</p> <p>Natalie smiled at her friend and took her hand. She slipped her arm through hers and closed her eyes. Carren turned and walked toward the front window. Natalie had a look in her eyes for several seconds, then looked back over her shoulder.</p> <p>"Can I ask you something?"</p> <p>Natalie blushed and nodded. "Sure."</p> <p>"Do you know what is on my phone?"</p> <p>Natalie's voice dropped to a whisper. "Sure."</p> <p>"I just want you to know that whatever is on your phone probably will have something to do with how the business is going."</p> <p>Natalie stared at the phone and smiled. It was something about a person like Carren. Her lips tightened around them again and she was happy to hear from her friend again. When Natalie had agreed to go out with Carren for dinner, she had asked for someone to go out with her. It had seemed like fun and, as she had already done when she had suggested to Carren it sounded like it should. Natalie had felt a bit embarrassed at having to say that, but somehow she knew that Carren did not want to be alone.</p> <p>"Can I tell you more?"</p> <p>Natalie laughed and her stomach lurched. "Sure. Go ahead."</p> <p>"I told you, I would never let someone do something to me that someone would not approve of," Natalie said.</p> <p>"I think you'll be good at it too," Carren replied. "I always knew it was going to be a great day."</p> <p>After Natalie had finished eating the food and poured it into a water glass, they went into the living room and Natalie placed her bag on a small stand at the end of the sofa. Once they were in the living room, Natalie stood on her toes and kissed Carren once on the lips.</p> <p>"Will you be able to make it through dinner without making something to eat?"</p> <p>"That's not true, Natalie," Carren protested. "I will not cook."</p> <p>"I'll make sure that's right," Natalie said, and she stepped into the room. With the lights off, she reached up and flicked the lights on inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
