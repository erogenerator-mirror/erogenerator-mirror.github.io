What did you...< /></p> <p>Toby: Oh, you know what I mean.</p> <p>Holly: Oh yeah..!</p> <p>Toby: I did what you did, and you did what I wanted.</p> <p>Holly: (trying to shake off the memories) So what, is that what you wanted?</p> <p>Toby: Ofcourse....</p> <p>Holly: Are you sure.</p> <p>Toby: You know I want you to make love to me.</p> <p>Holly: Oh, of course!</p> <p>Toby: I want that too!</p> <p>Holly: What do you mean? What makes you think that.</p> <p>Toby: Well, my dick isn't anywhere near as big as yours... and maybe a little smaller.</p> <p>Holly: I'm not sure that I like the idea of you giving into my wishes.</p> <p>Toby: Just get on with it, I'm enjoying myself.</p> <p>Holly: (suddenly realizing where this conversation is), what?</p> <p>Toby: Don't I get an opportunity to do something that I'd most love?</p> <p>Holly: (sighing) I'm willing to let you."</p> <p>Toby: Is that so?</p> <p>"Holly, would it be very weird somehow if you went home and I did something that I'd longed to do?"</p> <p>Holly: (smiling) "Only if...what did you want my body to be like from what I think?</p> <p>"Holly," said Toby</p> <p>"What, and it wouldn't be something you're not ready to do, as opposed to what you're doing, right?</p> <p>Toby: That would be weird....(whistling)</p> <p>Holly: (chuckling) I'm not sure about that at all....< /></p> <p>Toby: Well, since you want it...what do you need it for?</p> <p>Holly: I'd go along with something that you're not sure about, like you do in these kinds of things?</p> <p>Toby: Of course, there's more, but can it wait?</p> <p>Holly: That's what the first part of it is for me.</p> <p>Toby: And how is that?</p> <p>Holly: (sighing) Well, I'm not sure what to do. (sucking in a deep breath) I never thought that I'd go so far as to suggest it.</p> <p>Toby: Oh?</p> <p>Holly: (sighing) Well, what I really feel is if I can find another girl in the world that would let me give into my desires.</p> <p>Toby: And how exactly would you feel about it?</p> <p>Holly: (sighing) That depends. (sighing again) "On what kind of girl am I? (giggles) I'd like to see one who knows what she wants.</p> <p>Toby: And what makes you think you'd be good for me?</p> <p>Holly: Well, I don't know...I think it would be hot. Like I said already, a little. (Sighing) but it would be a lot more intense.</p> <p>Toby: And if you think you would really go through with it? (sighing) That is?</p> <p>Holly: (slightly giggling) that would be awesome. (racking her body up and down) I wouldn't be able to stop what I'm doing.</p> <p>Toby: Can I ask you something? Do you know about your fantasy?"</p> <p>Holly: "What?"</p> <p>Toby: "Do you think they would want to watch me screw another girl?"</p> <p>Holly: "You don't wanna know about the other girls?"</p> <p>Toby: "Sure."</p> <p>"Are you really serious, Toby?"</p> <p>"Well then you need to ask yourself what you want to do. What are you expecting if I want to be there?"</p> <p>Toby: "Well, if you had the chance, well then, if you think you like you could ask."</p> <p>Holly: "Wow...I...do I really want to. But how far would it really go?</p> <p>Toby: "Well I don't know. What should you ask?"</p> <p>Holly: "How would we do this?</p> <p>Toby: "Well, if you had the chance just ask, right?"</p> <p>Holly: (sighing) It sounds like fun. It will be really fun. I mean, if I get a chance, it can be fun being your girlfriend.</p> <p>Tobyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
