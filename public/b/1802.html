It never occurred to me that you had a brother. Not even close. I guess it must have something to do with the way you look. Does he know?"</p> <p>"He's been telling me for the last couple of months. I have no idea what got to him."</p> <p>"Tell me everything."</p> <p>"I met him at the party. I didn't see his suit but I got to know him pretty good."</p> <p>"You knew, huh? What about the night we met? " He asked with a crooked smile.</p> <p>"That was about eight years ago. I fell in love with you, Eric."</p> <p>"I know. And I got to know you. I'm glad you like me."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"Well, I had to work to find a way to get away from you."</p> <p>"We could still be together."</p> <p>"Of course we can. Why couldn't I be, I guess?" He smiled again and sat up. Before he could remove his jacket I said, "You're going to get in bed with just one person. We'll see how it goes. Don't go getting too excited about tonight."</p> <p>"You better. Not here where you're supposed to be spending the night with this man."</p> <p>"No. But I will if you want me to."</p> <p>"Of course I want you, baby." Now there was a smile in my voice and my hips were pressing against his crotch. He leaned back and said, "So I'll just sleep in your room tonight. It might be awkward for a while."</p> <p>"That'd be great," I cooed. "I'll sleep on the couch and we'll see where it goes."</p> <p>He laughed but quickly said, "I'll be down by the river at six. Don't get too excited, though."</p> <p>"We'll have to get you home before then."</p> <p>"We'll see," he whispered but kissed away my hair.</p> <p>When I came back to the table he was waiting for me to join him. The waiter gave our order and the waiter left to attend to my drink orders. I made sure I got a drink that was half full for myself and then leaned forward so Eric could kiss me. It was awkward at first but, after a few minutes, the alcohol was having it's benefits. We kissed each other's faces and necks for a bit then he asked if the appetizer was ready.</p> <p>We ate our fill and then went upstairs to shower. I got into his bed with him and quickly got in my shower. He was in the bathroom, getting it lit up when I opened the door. I was so turned on by this he started kissing me and playing with my tits as I washed off the wet hair from my head. After a bit he turned me around and had me stand facing the bathroom mirror. He then kissed me and led the way to his bed. We crawled back under the covers. After several minutes we were both naked beneath the covers and he slid in behind me and we were joined by our naked bodies. We kissed softly. I reached between us and slowly caressed his cock until he was fully erect so I could stroke it a little more slowly. Slowly and gently he stroked my nipples.</p> <p>"I like your tits," he said. "They're so taut."</p> <p>"Do my tits also?"</p> <p>"Oh, you already got me excited, I can tell." I leaned down and took his cock in my hand and started to lick him. Up and down. Then back to the head then back over it slowly. Up and down. Then all the way to the base and back again. Then back to the head. Up and down. He started moaning and soon I was sucking the head while he rubbed his fingers in my slick, wet opening. He was close to cumming and began to push his fingers harder inside me and I wanted him to cum in my mouth but he wouldn't. I kept licking, sucking and stroking as he tried to come within my mouth. I was so turned on that his body shuddered and I felt like I might cum right then.</p> <p>"Baby. I'm about to cum. Get ready. Baby. I'm about to cum."</p> <p>"Yes! Yes!"</p> <p>I felt his body shake and the first rope of cum exploded into my mouth and I swallowed it. He pulled his fingers up and began rubbing my clit, causing me to shake and moan. I felt his hips jerk as his cock pulsed his juice over and in my mouth. I sucked until he stopped breathing and then I started sucking hard and fast. He came with such force that I nearly threw off of the bed. By the time I had his cock hard again and was swallowing all of it, I was dripping wetâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
