I have a little something in my bag that you can use just in case."</p> <p>"And I'm certainly interested in something in your bag?"</p> <p>"Nope, only something special that you'll enjoy."</p> <p>She took me to a local gay bar and gave me a quick tour of the establishment. I was looking around, but she was nowhere to be seen. I was in a semi-completed corner of the bar but still couldn't quite make out any of the faces. We walked in and sat down at the bar without much of a conversation. She asked me what I was looking for. "Something sexy, very fem, really something sexy," she said while she poured me a beer. It was a little too hot in there so she ordered vodka martinis and I asked for my coke.</p> <p>"I don't think I would ever get drunk, thank you."</p> <p>"No, no, you have a very sexy body and I want you to wear something sexy that will drive my man wild," she said.</p> <p>"So that's when you're going to introduce me to a new guy?"</p> <p>She grinned, "Of course," "That's it, now I've got to go." As she left her beer and I finished pulling my skirt back on, I thought she would have taken me there too.</p> <p>She returned with my drink and we ordered some drinks, more than I usually liked. The conversation turned to our sex lives and she had confessed to one incident when we were both dating and had tried to get me to try it with him. I had told him that I wanted to lose my virginity to him that day. To this day I don't know why but I did. I was still married, but it was fun in a way and when I was about to get a guy, he was always willing to go along. I was nervous and so was he and the excitement from that day grew stronger. He brought it out in me when he would take off his pants and when we left, he always kept me there to make sure I was ready for him. It made me feel so feminine. That was his reason for inviting me to take a new guy. If you want to know what I think about, I'll tell you." When I looked at her face, she looked relieved enough to look embarrassed.</p> <p>"All thanks," I said smiling at her and taking another sip of my drink, "Now let's talk about something else though, before we go back home..."</p> <p>And it was. I thought her confession to me was going to drive me crazy but it was only to push me further into my past, that I would start to explore my sexuality.</p> <p>+++++++++++++++++</p> <p>The next Monday, I went home again. This time on Saturday, I took my husband a long, hot bath while I got ready. He had taken the day off from work and was sitting next to the tub when I returned. He was leaning back with my glass of water in his hand and smiled at me.</p> <p>"You look amazing. I always was a little worried that you weren't ready to take the next step."</p> <p>"Well, I haven't had any time for myself. Let's just have a nice dinner here tonight and see what happens. That should be enough excitement to make you ready for whatever happens tonight, isn't it?"</p> <p>He grinned and took the glass from my hand. "I'd love to have that, but I haven't been up to the challenge."</p> <p>"No, you're right. I would love to hear all about it," I leaned in and kissed him.</p> <p>"You're such a sweetie, but it looks like you're already looking forward to tonight," as we kissed. I looked down at his cock and wondered what I would be doing tomorrow night and if it would be as good as I was anticipating. I had a hard-on that I didn't want to put it out in the open, as I was very sure I would be able to take him up on all the things I had been planning for the remainder of the evening.</p> <p>"Tell me a little something about your guy?" I kissed him on the cheek.</p> <p>"Oh, he's a sweetie, his name is Jack. We got to know each other a long time ago, but I think he's still a little shy."</p> <p>"That's okay. You'll like him," I winked at him and kissed him again. He laughed, "So what's in the bag with these drinks?"</p> <p>"Oh, nothing really. I have some candles and a video game. I've also changed them into what Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
