And that wasn't enough for you?"</p> <p>"Is it fair you've only known me for a few hours?"</p> <p>I nodded and gave her the smallest of smiles. "I always wanted to be a nurse, and you've just become so beautiful and beautiful. So very lucky indeed." I couldn't help smiling at the sight on her face. She had a good, healthy look, with a soft look of pure beauty I found so sexy. The look in her eyes was alluring. She wanted to kiss me and make love, but I had to let her. "So can I give you an order then?"</p> <p>She gave me another smile and pulled my face up to hers. She kissed me sweetly at first, but then the kiss turned more insistent and we were grinding hard on each other. After a little while, she broke the kiss and slid back down to my neck. "There, do you want me to give you an order and I'll do it?"</p> <p>I nodded and told her that I liked her being a nurse.</p> <p>"Do you like me being a nurse?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes, I'm a nurse. Do you like being a nurse?"</p> <p>"Yes, I love it! It helps my mind relax, I like having a strong nurse."</p> <p>She kissed me again and then started to work her way down. She kissed my neck and upper chest and then to my breasts. She started to work her way down over them. After a few licks along my boobs, she slipped them off and let them play a bit. I wasn't sure what she was doing now, but there's no way they could be doing something just like this, as long as I could just lie back and enjoy it. "You have beautiful breasts," she said, softly, as she kissed my breast, circling it. The way her tongue teased the nipple brought a low moan to my lips and I closed them tightly to avoid any other noise until she got down to my breasts.</p> <p>Now she moved her hands to my waist, and started to undo my jeans. They seemed to fall to the floor. Next she pulled my jeans past my butt and off and kicked them aside. She stood up, stepped behind me and slowly stroked my ass. I felt like I was being licked by an invisible tongue. God! She was driving me crazy with desire.</p> <p>She knelt down and started to rub her hands up and down my butt cheeks. She leaned into me and started to kiss them. She kissed my earlobes then whispered in it. "You are so beautiful. You're so sexy," as she ran her tongue softly down my neck.</p> <p>She kissed my collar bone on the way down, down, down, then she started to kiss the front of my tits. She didn't linger a moment, but I could feel her tongue circling my nipple, while she gently worked it around it. Finally she started to work down my stomach and between my legs. I was on the brink of a second mini orgasm when she stopped and turned me around. "Lay on your back. I'll do your legs first." She went down on her knees.</p> <p>She started to work her way up my legs and then looked up at me with such an innocent smile. "You have gorgeous legs." She kissed my inner thigh. "Such a beautiful girl." She worked her way up to her knees. "You have such a beautiful ass." She licked my inner thigh. Once she reached my pussy, she slid back down to me and continued to work her way around to my other thigh. Her fingernail started at the same place and started tracing along my lips, then she plunged first one and then two of her fingers in and started to finger dance the way I like. "Your pussy is so beautiful."</p> <p>I could feel the head of her finger rubbing my clit as she talked. "You have the perfect body. Are you turned on by having a sexy woman in your care?"</p> <p>"Yes!" I moaned.</p> <p>She smiled. "So are you. But don't you think you should ask your boyfriend if he has a girlfriend?"</p> <p>"Yes!" I gasped.</p> <p>"Do you like having a sexy lady in your arms?"</p> <p>"Yes!" I said. She started to work her fingers in and out, rubbing my juices up and down the length of me.</p> <p>"Are you turned on, honey?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Do you like this?" she asked as she pushed two fingers up in. "Tell me how you like it."</p> <p>"Oh, god..." My knees suddenly began to buckle and I was starting to have trouble keeping my balance. She continued with her magic fingers, and was driving me crazy.
