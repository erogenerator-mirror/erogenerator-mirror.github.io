He had no idea how many girls he had fucked, and in his current state he was wondering how often. He had just fucked several girls at a time, and the more the merrier.</p> <p>"You're doing a great job of keeping your hands down," he said quietly. "In fact, your breasts are so beautiful it makes me hard."</p> <p>He watched her face as she stared into his eyes. "Don't be shy," he assured her, leaning in again and kissing her on the lips. "I've never kissed a girl."</p> <p>"Really? Really, baby?"</p> <p>He looked at her and grinned and she blushed again. "You have no idea."</p> <p>"Can I go next?"</p> <p>"Don't you have a date?" he asked.</p> <p>"I guess I do."</p> <p>"How about I pop over to dinner tonight, and you can pick up your things?"</p> <p>"I don't know, I probably don't have any."</p> <p>"Why don't you pick me up after dinner, and we meet the next time we go to dinner?"</p> <p>"Oh, that might work. I'll see you later."</p> <p>"Alright." He watched her face go from embarrassed to aroused as he walked toward his car. He could swear it was the tiniest bit of light that he could ever remember.</p> <p>"You better go to the grocery store today to try and figure something out," she replied as she walked toward the door. She smiled and started to close the door when she heard the door shut. She turned and looked at the large man in front of her. He had her standing there with her hands on her hips as he sat down in a nearby chair.</p> <p>"Come here," he commanded as he reached out and pulled her down against his body. She fell against him as if struck by a bolt of lightning, and he wrapped his arms around her.</p> <p>"God, do you ever make me feel this safe," she whispered as she pushed back against him. He held her close as his legs opened her body and her fingers found his erection. She slowly undid his shorts, and soon he was fully erect, but they were far enough away that they were only coming up between them.</p> <p>"No," he moaned when she slid the waistband of his briefs down, taking the weight of his cock with them. She looked up into his eyes, and he groaned when she pressed her lips to his as she slid her hand off the floor to reach under her knees. Seconds later he lifted her up and rolled her onto her back on top of him. Her skirt had fallen to the floor, and even covered her legs, and it was completely sheer from the moment she had left the room without putting her underwear on. His cock was now pressing between her legs, and she could feel how aroused he got watching her come. He lowered her slightly so they were both completely hidden from the street, their lips just touching as he leaned back to gaze at her naked body.</p> <p>He reached out with both hands and cupped the full breast that he always appreciated so much in the world of women, and he felt her hard nipple press against his fingers as they closed around it. He pinched it slightly as he leaned back and gently lifted her into his arms. Her legs wrapped around him so tightly that he thought they both were going to fall off the end of the bed where they had collapsed upon it. He lifted his arms and held her against him as her hips raised themselves from the bed, leaving just the top of him, his tip brushing against her clit, making her moan as she moved it back and forth on him. A drop of liquid was now forming on the head of the cock that he slid between her lips. She leaned her forehead against his, kissing him as one of her hands reached down to the shaft of his penis, and she began stroking as her hips rose and fell once more. She came again, and he began thrusting in just as she was.</p> <p>She reached down with one hand and reached beneath him to press herself against her own hand as it began to slide up and down the full length of his shaft in a smooth rhythm. It drove him to the edge with each stroke, and he thrust into her, so that she could feel how swollen his head was as he went. She pulled it back out, then slid it up to the tip and held it in her mouth, making him moan as more of the wetness coated himself and her mouth. He felt the wetness against his shaft again as she began to roll his testicles with her hand, and this did it for him.
