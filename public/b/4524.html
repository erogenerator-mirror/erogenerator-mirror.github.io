My tongue slowly slid into her mouth and she returned the kiss, gently pushing back against me, and for my part I felt an almost indescribable buzz come over me.</p> <p>"Kiss me," she whispered as she looked up at me through half closed eyes.</p> <p>I smiled down at her, and she kissed me harder, pushing herself up against me, her tongue twisting inside my mouth, as I pushed her back down.</p> <p>"I want to see you kiss, girl."</p> <p>Her head lifted but she didn't make any move to leave me. I looked down at our reflections, her face, her body, her breasts, and my cock. They were huge, the nipples pointed upwards, and I felt that she was wearing a sports bra beneath the blouse, making them look even bigger. I felt my heart pound as I fought the urge to touch them, but I had no intention of doing anything wrong.</p> <p>I kissed her again, and she pulled away but again she opened for me, this time sliding her tongue between my lips, her mouth closing around me.</p> <p>She moved in a little, then back, her tongue slipping between my lips, making me open wider, my tongue touching hers like a sword.</p> <p>I felt her hands on my back, her fingers slowly tracing the lines of my skin; I took little glances at the other end of the couch where her boyfriend used it to watch TV, only to find him kneeling on it, drinking from her beer as she watched us make out. I felt myself getting turned on by the sight of her like that, and my cock became even harder.</p> <p>She moved faster under my lips, then suddenly pressed her hips together into my palm, making me groan.</p> <p>"Ohhhh," I murmured, looking up at her again. "I've wanted this for ages."</p> <p>"Me too," she breathed. "Please."</p> <p>I couldn't resist, and my cock sprang to life as I pushed two fingers into her, feeling her body tense again as she let out a little groan.</p> <p>"Oh god, please," she whispered, and I had no more to take.</p> <p>I pulled my fingers out, my tongue dragging along her labia, and she cried out.</p> <p>"Oh, god, please don't stop," she moaned, and pulled her head back, gasping, as I took her again.</p> <p>"Let me see," I said as I pulled her to me again, making her lay down again, so she was at the end of the couch.</p> <p>I stood, watching her as I came back to the chair, my hands on my cock, but then her head, already tipped back, reached for my prick.</p> <p>"Are you going to just take me? I asked, looking up at her.</p> <p>"I'll do it," she said, almost sobbing. "Please, don't tease me."</p> <p>As I moved out in front of her I slid the rest of my clothes off to expose my erect penis, and a slight smile crossed the features of her face as we looked at each other, both of us watching the other.</p> <p>"Oh my," she whispered, "You're good at that."</p> <p>"Good?" I said, licking my lips and looking down at her.</p> <p>"You know you're going to like it."</p> <p>"I've never been with a guy before," I said, making no move to stop her, and she just looked at me, making only a little bit of movement toward me.</p> <p>"It's okay with me if you want to," I said.</p> <p>"You can do anything you want, I'm sure."</p> <p>"That's good."</p> <p>I moved to her, sitting at the end of it again, my knees either side of her body, and I kissed her again, as I had done this all her life. She kissed me back, moving her body with mine, our breasts rubbing against each otherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
