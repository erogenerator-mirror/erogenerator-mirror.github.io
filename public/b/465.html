A very short time would have made you even more desirable to me but that was not how I wanted it or how you wanted it so I kept it to myself. You are my submissive partner. I do not expect you or anyone else to do the same. I can't even think of anyone I'm going to tell you that that is because I just want you to meet your Master. Do I understand that?"</p> <p>I don't know what I expected but I certainly never expected that it would turn me on to think I was making him into my slave. As I mentioned before his dick is big and I have noticed that his tongue seems to be longer when he is licking it. I also noticed that my body was responding to him and my pussy was getting wet and ready to explode. I don't know how long it had been but I wanted him so bad I forgot myself and gave myself to him completely.</p> <p>I asked, "Mistress, why are you asking me that?"</p> <p>"I want to be your obedient submissive slave. I love making you happy and you want to submit to me."</p> <p>"Are your balls tingling at saying those things to me?" I asked him.</p> <p>"Yes, they are tingling and my dick is standing up on it's own in all its glory," he responded.</p> <p>"I love your smell," I whispered.</p> <p>His dick began to throb and throb as my hand moved against his butt. I wanted to go to him and tell him off but I couldn't bring myself to speak. I had to say this. I couldn't. I couldn't look anywhere else. I had to feel it. I had to.</p> <p>"I want to feel it too. That's it. Make me cum, slave." He said.</p> <p>We continued to exchange looks. I wanted to say something so bad but I couldn't muster up what I knew would come. Then to my relief they broke and he turned around in front of me. It was so strange and exciting. I watched as he began to rub his butt with his right hand and began to finger his left, sliding it along his tight, swollen anus. He never looked to me about the matter. I could hardly see anything.</p> <p></p> <p>My pussy was so wet. I could feel it between my legs. I wanted to have my Master's dick in my mouth. But I couldn't.</p> <p>I could feel his finger sliding in, slowly into my asshole. I was so surprised at something. I thought he was going to start out slowly and stop at the entrance to my rectum but then he began moving his finger in and out, in and out. He was pulling all the way out and I felt the hot, slickness of his finger as he slid it in and out of my ass. I couldn't stop moving. I couldn't control my body. My body was moving. I had no idea what I was letting myself in for. My cock was harder than a rock. So soft. I could feel my lips being parted by him and the tip of his tongue licking my lips.</p> <p>“Oh, good, slave. That's it. Make my cock harder.”</p> <p>He laughed and began moving the head of his dick closer, up, to the mouth of my asshole.</p> <p>“You're going to make me cum, slave.” I whispered.</p> <p></p> <p>In spite of my own desire my pussy was still pulsating and I wanted him to continue to finger his ass as he slid in and out of my body. I had no control now at all. He fingered my ass until it began to clench, then began to slowly withdraw his finger. Then he would begin to slip it from my body until it left my skin leaving me feeling empty. Finally, he would begin to fuck my ass.</p> <p>I knew we could still make it but at the same time was excited about the thought of him continuing to finger my ass. I loved that thought. He was still playing with my clit and his dick really was hard now and pulsing. He continued to finger my ass as I lay there and I watched him rub the head of his big dick up and down between both my lips and then back down again—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
