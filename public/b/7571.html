I drove around and made sure we were away from the city, which would be quite a distraction, especially at the club. We arrived back at her car at the garage of our condo. I unlocked our door and ushered her inside, and then turned my attention to hers.</p> <p>My cock was rigid with excitement, and the sight of Jessica's bare ass nearly made me lose control. She pushed me down onto the couch and began to kiss me, one hand on my dick while the other started to caress my balls and I began to feel it rise up, getting harder and higher. Jessica's tongue explored my mouth and slid down towards my throat as her hand worked over my cock through my swimsuit. I closed my eyes, as my orgasm built, and pushed Jessica's hand away for a moment. Her lips remained close to my mouth.</p> <p>We stared intensely into each other's eyes as she licked and kissed me more expertly, her face flushed with pleasure, and her hands caressing my shoulders and back. Her hand slid under my swimsuit bottom and under my balls, caressing the underside of my penis. Her lips parted.</p> <p>She brought my mouth down to her ear and whispered, "Is it alright with you? Isn't this what you wanted?"</p> <p>"Oh, god, yes."</p> <p>"We're going to have so much fun together."</p> <p>Jessica leaned over and kissed me, once more sliding her hand down my body. She slid it under the elastic of my swimsuit and between my legs, her fingers brushing the hot, wet fabric against the head of my cock. The sensation was so erotic, we were kissing for all I was worth, her mouth on my chin, my hands on her firm ass, her lips working hard against mine. I felt her rub my head against the soft fabric, then the coolness of her body pressing against my hard cock as Jessica continued to kiss me.</p> <p>Jessica slid her hand off my cock head and slowly slid her body down mine, her long, long hair tickling my chest at the ends of it. She pressed her breasts firmly against my chest as the head of my cock pressed against her stomach through our swimsuit as well. Her nipples were hard and sensitive under my skin. She took me into one hand and slid it to the small of her back, and up and down, over and over the length of her long, sexy body as we kissed. I was on fire inside, almost coming with the desire I saw in Jessica's eyes and in her breath. Finally, after months of longing, I felt her hand slide off mine and she slid herself down my body, pressing her body to mine, making sure she reached my cock with her hand as she pressed her lips against mine.</p> <p>She sucked at my tongue, kissing me gently. I felt her hand slide down between us and I felt the warmness of her body on mine. My cock was pressing against her stomach as she kissed me. "You like this, don't you? I know you do."</p> <p>I reached up and cupped one of her breasts, rubbing her nipple between my thumb and forefinger. "Oh, yeah." She ground against me like a wild thing.</p> <p>"I've never done this before," I whispered. "I've never done anything like this before, to anything."</p> <p>Jessica paused, staring at me as she slid her legs off the couch and kneeled before me. "Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Go ahead," I answered. She pushed my swimsuit up and off, dropping her wet bikini down to the floor and leaning in to kiss me. We kissed hungrily. I could taste her mouth and feel her tongue exploring mine.</p> <p>Jessica spread her arms, allowing me to lift her, lifting her off of the couch as they continued to kiss. Her legs straddled my waist as I lifted her, my cock fully erect against her stomach as my hands cupped her ass. Our hands moved to each other's bodies and I gently ran my fingers up her inner thighs to grasp her warm, wet center.</p> <p>I continued to kiss her, slowly moving up her neck, chest, until we kissed again, with a growing urgency. Our kiss became more passionate. Our bodies slid against each other as our hands explored. I slid my hands up her back, over her hair and across her shoulders. Jessica's arms fell back, giving herself to me, and I let them drop to her sides. She moved them along her sides then up again. I slid one hand over her stomach to her hip, and up her side until I could cup her bare breast. I squeezed it and felt the weight of it as I continued to kiss the inside of her neck.</p> <p>Suddenly, it was as though all tension was completely gone. The kiss had left me breathless and so aroused I could barely breathe, and she held me, pressing her bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
