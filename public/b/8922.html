He was so beautiful and she always found it hard to imagine her husband's face at work and not see his cock as it throbbed and twitched in her hand. All her doubts were erased as the man took one last hold on her thigh. It was as if he had a vise on it. He tugged at it softly and felt a shudder of arousal pass through her as he did.</p> <p>“It doesn’t have to go any farther than this…” she said in a husky whisper.</p> <p>“It will if you let it. Please,” he said as softly as he was able to, looking back at her through his dark eyes. Her eyes widened and she bit her lip nervously. He pulled back ever so slightly and then pressed both hands against the smooth material at her thigh. She gasped when his hand cupped the hot flesh of her thigh between her legs. She gripped the back of his head and he pulled back. A low groan escaped him and she closed her eyes against the light but could not control the shiver that began to take over her entire body. He slowly slid his fingers up and down her thighs. “Don’t you want to fuck me?” she gasped out, almost overwhelmed by the sensations as his hand began to rub against the soft skin of her inner thigh. He nodded and pulled back and then slid his hand up her belly.</p> <p>A shudder went through her as his fingers brushed against her nipples. Her hands came up to cover his and she clenched them there tightly.</p> <p>“You can’t make me…” she said.</p> <p>He pulled her hands down by her palms until they rested there. She pushed them away slowly and gazed at his face with wide eyes. “Do you think I want you to want me,” she whispered. She stared into his deep brown eyes, her face flushed with excitement. She shivered just a little as he pressed his finger tips along her outer lip. She leaned into him a little as his hands moved up to the nape of her neck, his finger tips lightly brushing against her exposed flesh. Her breath caught her in her throat as she felt something warm and wet against her lips.</p> <p>“You will,” he replied without pulling away from her.</p> <p>“I know… I’m nervous… please don’t make me…” she whispered. Before he could answer, she slid her knees apart and felt him take a second step forward, his hands coming round her body. She looked up at him over her shoulder as he slid them along her hips, up over the curve of her bottom, lifting the tiny skirt to her waist. Her breath caught in her throat and she lifted her hands, resting her hands on his chest. “Oh my god," she whispered breathlessly.</p> <p>Her hands came up to his shoulders and she drew him forward, then as he stepped his hands to her waist, she lowered his hands until he had one hand flat against her breasts, the other one sliding down and gripping her thong from the back. He was pressing up against her, his cock pressing up firmly against her body. She could feel the moist silk of her panties as it rubbed across the hot flesh beneath. She wanted to cry out, but didn’t, her voice was weak, her lips parted as they trembled.</p> <p>His fingers were on her hips, pressing, sliding, pulling the thin fabric away from her. It would have been so easy to take them away, take her panties off. But she didn’t want to make a complete fool of herself. His hands ran along her thighs and then began to press up against the silky fabric, the fabric caressing and caressing her clit. She closed her eyes and leaned forward, forcing her breasts against him as he squeezed her breasts.</p> <p>He had to tilt his head down to kiss her, it was so sexy. Her breasts were pressed up against his lips and the hot kiss and the feel of it was incredible. His lips brushed across hers and then slowly drew back, slowly, as if he couldn’t believe he was doing this. When his lips grazed across her tongue, her heart jumped. He moved his hands to pull her body close to him again, his kiss, his lips on her tongue, his tongue probing, tasting. His lips pressed against her ear, his teeth brushing her lobe. She shuddered, shuddering on his mouth, feeling the wet feeling of her panties against her skin and in his mind.</p> <p>She closed her eyes and opened her mouth to his. He sucked on her tongue, tasting her skin. He could feel the heat of her body against his and heard her whisper his name. She didn’t care about the mess they were making. She was totally lost in his kiss, so—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
