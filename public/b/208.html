"You little slut!” he snapped. “You came here this weekend wearing this little black dress! You came here with that little outfit that showed off everything in the fashion industry; you came on my boat, so what was the red on the back of this short slip on you?”</p> <p>“Your ship?” she said with a little voice.</p> <p>“Of course you were,” he answered. “But you came onto my boat to get out of the heat! Where are all those people and who’s with whom are you?”</p> <p>“Don’t you think I came here to get away?” she shot him an accusatory glance. “Please put down your cup,” she pleaded. She reached behind the table and grabbed John’s hand and pulled him up out of his chair. John struggled but held up his cup. She pulled John to his feet and began taking his shirt off. They stumbled outside to get dressed. The cooler was open, he grabbed it and the cooler. He followed her outside with her. As they both sat in the cooler, she pulled her blouse out of her pants. She removed it and handed it to him. He took it from her and put it on his lap.</p> <p>“Thank you,” she said. John smiled at her as she put her clothes back on. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have done that.”</p> <p>“No, no of course not,” he answered, placing his cup on the table. “There is no need to apologize. I think we got to the reason you came here; now we shall just get it over with. I hope you don’t think you can tell that this is our cruise.”</p> <p>“No, I think you’re right.”</p> <p>“Well, you look even more beautiful than before.” He looked at her and smiled.</p> <p>“What do you mean?” she asked.</p> <p>“I said that you are gorgeous,” he answered.</p> <p>“But what about you?” she asked.</p> <p>“Do you really think I can tell that you are beautiful?”</p> <p>She paused. “No, what do you expect from a man?” she asked. “I’m not sure. I guess I’m just so hot in a sexy business suit wearing this little dress I didn’t realize even my nipples could poke through.”</p> <p>“Oh that’s right,” John replied. “I see. Well, let’s fix that. Let’s see if I don’t know how you feel about me. I’m not sure how much to trust but I know what it is that drives me nuts.” He took the cup away. “You have nothing to fear from me. I’m not going to force myself on you, and you’ll stay on your boat.”</p> <p>“Well…maybe…if we really do get off here and find another place, okay?”</p> <p>“That would be great,” John said. "We’ll catch up. I’m starving. I hope we can find a decent place to eat dinner. Maybe we will.”</p> <p>She hesitated but took the opportunity to reach up and feel his chest. “That’s a wonderful idea, my dear. I hope it’s not too uncomfortable for you. Do you think you can make up your mind?”</p> <p>John looked to the direction of the sun on the beach. His eyes ran over her figure appreciatively. He decided to let her decide. “Come on, we’ll find a place,” he said.</p> <p>In the small cabin, they sat on the sleeping bag, John resting on one elbow. After a long, uncomfortable day at sea, John felt good. They had only gone on the cruise a couple days when he remembered what happened the past couple of years ago.</p> <p>“It’s true the two of you were never close,” John said. “But your relationship changed in more ways than one day you—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
