One of her hands, or two as it was called, pulled her panties to the side and buried a finger up her pussy. He could make out the wet squelching sounds of it as she got more turned on. He could even see her face turning from pleasure to lust for what she was doing to himself. Suddenly she stopped.</p> <p>For a second all he saw was her perfect face, her large black eyes watching him, almost hypnotized by his actions. Then, she looked him in the eyes and smiled a wicked smile.</p> <p>"Well," she said, "I have to get home! I will wait until you get home to have fun!" and she started to move in a frenzied way, pushing out her ass to give him a better view of her wetness.</p> <p>He was in shock. This was the most erotic thing he had ever seen. Then, he saw it for the first time. His breath was taken away in excitement, but he couldn't stop her...could never leave herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
