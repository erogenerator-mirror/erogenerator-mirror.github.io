It gave me good access to his sack, and I had to give him a good time to suck. He then pushed up with his hips, trying to force my head down. I knew that he was close, and I could feel myself about to climax in my throat; I could barely take more than two minutes with him, but I was determined to hold out.</p> <p>I looked at his face. That grin, all his hard work, his eyes, he was almost as good as Dave at sucking cock! I smiled, and continued. I had wanted to see him go down on Dave, not just for myself, but for Dave's experience, not to just the first time, but for me. I liked that idea more than anything I had ever fantasized about.</p> <p>I felt him stiffen when he was close, and knew he was going to come. I looked up at him from his balls to see him sucking in air as I swallowed his delicious cream. It filled my throat, so I had swallowed every drop. He finally looked down at me, and smiled a little as I pulled my face up to meet my eyes. I was smiling and he was grinning, as we kissed. I felt him soften in my mouth, and knew that he would be able to come again. This time, however, he needed to push me down before I lost him.</p> <p>We kissed more passionately, his tongue swirling around my lips. I was surprised to find that although it must have been the first time we had gone down on each other, the thrill of what we had done had added to the experience. I found that I liked being with him, and he enjoyed it. He did have his limits, if not his expectations, but I loved it and was so lucky to have a lover so far from home. I was proud to be with someone whom I could do this for, and it felt good. Even so, I didn't want to lose him yet. "Dave?" I whispered.</p> <p>"Yeah?" he replied from under my arm, and I didn't even see him stop his breathing.</p> <p>"How do you feel?" I asked, feeling his heart beat rapidly. "Am I doing right for you?"</p> <p>Dave looked at me, "You made the right decision, baby!" he said in a happy tone. His heart had been beating fast so he pulled back from me, kissed the tip of my nose, and held me tight, "Your mouth is so beautiful! Your lips are so soft! I'm so glad to be with a woman again!"</p> <p>I laughed, "Yeah? What happened after you sucked off Dave?"</p> <p>"We tried to get together again... to spend more time together," he told me, "that time was great too, you were wonderful! I want you to keep doing that, okay?" I nodded. Dave had come to that conclusion, and I knew that when Dave was feeling good, he was going to do it to his woman. I thought he could understand that. This was our little threesome, with his lover or his wife and I didn't care. We wouldn't go further. I just wanted it to be perfect.</p> <p>I laughed, and whispered to him, "Why don't we see what the rest of the weekend brings, lover? I'll let you know when I have something in mind for you." I kissed his lips as I reached behind my back, and grabbed my t-shirt. "And, don't wear any panties after we fuck!" I grinned as I handed him my shirt. "Here," I added as he pushed my shirt down, "Put this on." I handed him my shirt as I was taking his shirt off, "and your pants! There's no point in losing my shirt."</p> <p>We kissed again as we left the room, and I knew for sure that he would have it off in only a minute. On the way to the bed, I took his hand and kissed him. I liked him a lot, and he felt the same about me. We had never been more in love this way. I kissed him again, as he was about to return my kiss, and we could wait for our lovemaking to start again, but I wanted to make some time for it! We undressed completely and quickly crawled on the bed together, and were both naked within minutes. We fell on our sides, facing each other, and kissed slowly. I was holding his body in mine now, and stroked his hair while our kiss grew in intensity. I was happy that he was ready to make love again... that he already had.</p> <p>We continued toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
