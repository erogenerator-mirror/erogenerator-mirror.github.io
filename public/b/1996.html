"And what you just did for me?" he asked, looking up at her, her eyes almost glowing with color, their depths shifting from her own to her. She grinned with it. "You do believe in what feels good, and it looks so good that it's right now," he said as he brought his hand to her breast.</p> <p>Her body jumped at his touch, a feeling she'd rarely had. It took her breath away momentarily, "Yeah, like you could ever imagine."</p> <p>"I'm not that old, I'm thirty two," he said, and he was more than half in shock. "I think women with as good a body as yours can't wait to feel better. We just need to keep our hormones in check for a few months," he reminded her, bringing his hands to her thighs and cupping her firm ass, still warm and welcoming. "Your body is one of the best in the world."</p> <p>"You're the man who told me I could enjoy every minute of it," she smiled at him. She didn't know how she had managed to convince herself to call herself any woman at all, but she did. She'd given herself over to him, willingly, not just once but every day. In the few months since their wedding, though, she'd never admitted it to anyone else.</p> <p>"I don't think there's anything a man could ever turn down," he said, gently nipping at her neck before running his hand up and down her thigh. "But right now, I want to share everything with you."</p> <p>"Oh, God, you can give me anything you want with just knowing that you wanted it as badly as I did," she said, her eyes rolling in her head as though he wasn't even trying to make sense of her words.</p> <p>It was a little more than her initial admission she didn't know she wanted from the man she'd married so long ago. But her voice didn't change one bit, her lips parting with a tiny bit of softness before she said, "Thank you, you're welcome. It makes me feel so alive when you're thinking about it."</p> <p>"I have my mind set, I can handle it," he assured her, giving her ass a squeeze of course. "When I'm your husband, I always have fun loving you. I do love you, sweetheart and I want you to know that too," he smiled, taking her hand to move her out of his grasp.</p> <p>She couldn't resist a moment of sadness. "I know you do," she said, and in response, he kissed her cheek and looked into her eyes. "Now I can get away with even this once," he announced to her with a smile. "But I need to ask you one last question, what happened to you the other day?"</p> <p>"That was an amazing wedding. You are just one of my best friends in a way I never expect a bride to be," she said, her arms slipping around her husband's neck and pulling him down to her lips for a long kiss. "Are you ready to go?"</p> <p>"I'm just about ready to be," he replied, pulling back from the kiss to admire her once more as she pulled him with her. She was dressed in a strapless, pale blue dress that accentuated the curves of her curves. The soft black cloth clung to her body and left a hint of color, hinting to how her nipples would show in the evening when she was ready. She was wearing a black satin, shoulder length dress with large, dark slits that fell just above her knees that revealed a generous amount of thigh and her dark hair cascaded down in a wild and beautiful cascade.</p> <p>She pulled him into her arms as soon as the door shut behind them, kissing him deeply as soon as he released it.</p> <p>He'd never been in love with a girl before, it was amazing. He'd never even considered himself lucky enough to ever be kissed. Her lips felt so soft and soft and warm against his. He'd never been kissed like that. He wanted to make love to her, but even though she had an air of innocence, he knew she had a heart, the same feeling of self esteem as she had when she was young. He'd spent so much time thinking of her as a young woman who could have been him, not just a young wife, but someone who truly wanted to do the things he loved. And he loved her to death for it.</p> <p>They ended her kiss just as the doorknob turned and the door locked. He felt her soft hand slide aroundâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
