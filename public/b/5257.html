She cried out.</p> <p>"Come to me like a kitten."</p> <p>"Okay, I will be naked."</p> <p>"Get those clothes off."</p> <p>"No! You may only be naked. You cannot strip off my own clothes. I said no!"</p> <p>"You didn't have time to change."</p> <p>"No!"</p> <p>"Yes, but you will. Let me get to that hot pussy."</p> <p>Kylie hesitated for a moment, when she finally realized that what she was doing was wrong. To do what she was doing was to be a whore. A prostitute, yes, but not her actual boyfriend. And no, she did not like stripping. Why would he want her to strip? He could have just gone to hell if he wanted to see her naked. So why would he?</p> <p>She slowly pulled her panties down and stepped out of them, then quickly tossed them into the darkness, before moving back to the bedroom.</p> <p>"Let me do it." She said as she began to unbutton her blouse.</p> <p>"No!"</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Let me do it. I can do it."</p> <p>"No." He said quietly.</p> <p>"Good. Now, we'll see if you're right. Come on."</p> <p>"No!"</p> <p>"No, you can't strip off my clothes, Kylie, just let me take your clothes off."</p> <p>She felt so vulnerable, wearing only her bra and panties, as she slowly removed the rest of her clothes. Her legs were trembling, as she slowly peeled off the last of the remaining clothing. Now, with only her bra and panties in hand, she quickly undid her bra. It fell to her sides as did her blouse.</p> <p>"Kylie, are you sure this is all right?"</p> <p>"Yes, but why?"</p> <p>"It's a secret I have to keep from my parents. They will find out."</p> <p>"It doesn't matter, honey. Just be proud."</p> <p>Kylie thought this to be the very best idea she had ever had. She got on the bed, climbed up on top of him, and positioned herself over his still erect cock. Just as she was about to slide her little wet sex down over his cock, he grabbed her and pulled her to him. Her heart was racing, as he was about to ravage her, and right before he kissed her, she quickly started to kiss him, too.</p> <p>And it was wonderful. Their lips melted as their tongues explored each other, and their lips were like iron hard springs. As they lay there, kissing, kissing, and kissing, neither had realized that neither of them had ever taken her clothes off. They were in their own world, and they were just getting started. After a few, long moments, Kylie finally spoke.</p> <p>"No, we can't do it. There are going to be consequences. Will you forgive me?"</p> <p>"I still have the key for your hand, Kylie. I have to let it go, and get it. Now, get off him."</p> <p>He lay there as she slowly began to unbuckle his belt. She removed his belt as quickly as she could. In the end, she quickly undid the button of his pants and pulled down the zipper. She pulled down his briefs, and then slowly and with a great deal of skill, slid his underwear off.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" he said loudly.</p> <p>"I'm not doing anything!" She replied. She then pulled his pants off, leaving him standing there, naked. He pulled himself out of the bed, and looked down at her.</p> <p>"Get off him, please. I really want you to undress me."</p> <p>She stood up, and moved over to him. He pulled her down in front of him, and she knelt. His legs were a bit shaky, as she worked her way up his legs, finally settling on his stomach. When she got to his waist, she looked up at him.</p> <p>"I just want you so badly!" she said.</p> <p>"Please, I will do whatever you want. Please?"</p> <p>"You can trust me." They lay there for a long time, as he gently stroked her hair. She could still feel the burning sensation down her spine, and she felt dizzy. Finally, he said.</p> <p>"I need to say this. From now on, ever time we make love, you will remain naked. Do you understand?"</p> <p>"Yes, I understand. I'm sorry."</p> <p>"Do itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
