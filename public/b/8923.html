Her father had asked her to help as she had come to be a woman—which she had always believed to be impossible. They had been trying to raise her, but she had been a stick in the mud. He had even told her that she should have a career in psychiatry, when she could have done it herself. She remembered her mother helping her move, to help her with her education and get her confidence, until she reached her current place. Even her mother had been a bit of a fool, being one of the only men in the family that seemed to accept her and her family. The only female friend she had was her own sister and they had talked for much longer than she had.</p> <p>"Dad gave me a job as a housekeeper for once, but it took a lot of effort to get it going. I did what needed doing, to keep from becoming a drider, since my dad was not an honorable man. I mean, even when I was old enough to be your mother's father, I still should have fought with him for it, had I known he would have stopped it."</p> <p>Marianna couldn't help the tears that came to her eyes as she thought of his words. She could have done so much, but he had always called her in the future and she had been so ashamed. She would never forgive him, since she never cared anything about his decision. She sighed heavily as she took a sip of water and tried to regain her composure. She didn't care if she was a drider—she didn't have a choice anyway.</p> <p>"Marianna," he sighed and looked away from her. "I don't think I get you anymore. We were just having a good time together, that's all I did."</p> <p>She nodded as he continued. "I think it's the same, since I wanted you as well. I'm not as angry with you as you may think."</p> <p>Marianna nodded and looked away from him. His words hit her, at how much she was enjoying their time together. She had always known that she was different, not a prude, but still. She remembered those wild parties with all the drunkenness and power show she had participated in. And there was her own father—who had made her a woman and had helped her with her new job.</p> <p>"Thank you for telling me about it, but I've been in a lot of trouble," she admitted.</p> <p>"Me too," he stated, shaking his head at her apparent happiness. "I told you that before, I did not need you. Now, I'm trying to make you my daughter. Just be sure you're pregnant as well. I would like that, as long as you don't get the disease I'm going out of my way to prevent you from getting any further. Now, get up and get that bath started. There will be time for talking later, if you'd like. You should just stay here and do what you normally do. The tub is up there."</p> <p>Marianna sighed. This man seemed like a nice man. She needed to go out and make love to him more than she had to. She smiled as she went and turned toward the bathroom. She began to put the bath on, but couldn't get the water to do it.</p> <p>"Will this help?" she asked.</p> <p>He nodded as he turned, making her jump as he looked at her in surprise. "Just what we did, was more than pleasurable for both of us. Come on. Now that we're all done with our 'talk', you can get this out of your system for the time being."</p> <p>Marianna smiled as she walked to her bedroom to do his bidding. She felt like they'd finally gotten on to a real bed and when she opened up the drawer, she found a vibrator she hadn't used yet. One last test, to see if he was going to stop her. The last time he had talked about her like this; he'd said he really was going to stop her. Marianna watched as he picked up the device to check out. She had almost given up her fight about it but he had stopped her. He knew that was a bad thing. He would always fight a losing battle, which was why this man was so good at it.</p> <p>That night, Marianna came to him once again—and she still fought with every ounce of defiance.</p> <p>"You won't regret it," he told her. "There is no choice. No matter what happens. Just do it and let go. That's all you will ever be or ever be. You don't need to be tied down any longer. You're ready to fight whatever happens."</p> <p>Marianna shook her head, not wanting—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
