I'm a married woman with a young lover and an incredible mind."</p> <p>I smiled at her but tried to look down at the hard dick in front of me. It had to be about nine inches long and thick and rock hard. "Do you want me to fuck you, or would you rather someone else do it?"</p> <p>Looking back at me, she licked her lips and said, "I'll let you decide what you want. What do you want to do, do you want to make love to me?"</p> <p>My heart beat faster just watching her answer. I couldn't help but to think that I could be her second lover since we had met. I could not believe I was actually thinking this dirty as she looked back at me with that sexy face. "I think we better get going, I've got to leave. It's too early to meet up at the club," I replied nervously.</p> <p>"Oh, sorry, I will meet you back in the lobby," Julie answered, "you can take the subway out the way, and I'll meet you back here in the lobby when you're ready."</p> <p>"It's alright," I replied, "thank you so much."</p> <p>I looked back down at my stiff cock as we walked out of the room. It was getting harder by the second. I just knew I would be taking it all off in the next few minutes.</p> <p>Once outside, Julie led me to the subway tunnel that the lobby had and pulled me through. The tunnel felt like it was made just for the two of us. Just as we arrived, a guy on the first aisle stood in the opposite line of people. The couple was both dressed like guys, in black jeans, and a shirt. One looked about thirty, but from the way he watched me he assumed he was probably in his late thirties. I couldn't help but look down at the bulge in his pants. I thought about Julie telling him that her ex boyfriend used to fuck her in the ass. As we walked out of the tunnel, I noticed another guy on the second aisle with his trousers and shirt on. He too looked at me and said "Do you like my dick?"</p> <p>"It's nice and thick for a man," I answered, "but your cock is not."</p> <p>I noticed another guy at the next aisle as I walked up and down the row in front of him. He had dark hair and brown eyes. I could see his skin glistening from the light of the tunnel. I felt my face color up at the thought of being on the subway with him.</p> <p>When we got to the car, Julie grabbed the keys and we were out the door. To her delight, I was actually going for the subway without a bra.</p> <p>Once in the car, as the doors were closed, Julie jumped in the back seat with me, put her feet up on the dash and started kissing my neck. I had to push her away just a bit. I could not get the image of her kissing my neck out of my head! Julie knew how to kiss and I soon lost all thought of our rendezvous.</p> <p>When we got to the restaurant, Julie was sitting between the three men. I felt very out of place as I stood in the car. I watched as they each grabbed one of Julie's tits and squeezed it. She tried to move but was unable to move her arms. Just when she started to move again, they both grabbed her and forcefully shoved her against the back of the seat.</p> <p>"I said NO!" I thought to myself as I looked around trying to see if anyone could see what was going on.</p> <p>"If I give you permission to touch me, and kiss me, you will not get in trouble again from me." I said as I turned away from them.</p> <p>Julie started to get up from the back seat just as we were passing some of the tables out. I kept my head down the rest of the way and went to the back of the row of tables with the four of them.</p> <p>As we passed the one with the guy closest to her, Julie reached over and put her hand on his crotch and started to rub his cock. She had him in her mouth, working her tongue around the head.</p> <p>"You really get me turned on when you do that," I said looking in the back seat.</p> <p>When Julie slid off of the seat and went to kneel down beside the guy on the seat she had been with just then. "So are you ready to see my cock again, or do you want to wait until you meet me back at the hotel?" she asked as she pushed him back on the seat.</p> <p>As Julie stood up over him and started to take off her clothes, one of the guys got a lookâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
