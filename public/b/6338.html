"So hard. So good. I want you. I want to make you feel good. This is just for you."</p> <p>He took my hands and guided them down to the bed then onto the bed, where I felt his hand on my thigh. He rubbed it, his hands moving closer. Then he slid his hand lower, stroking the outside of my wet pussy.</p> <p>"My, you're so wet," he moaned on my cheek, and his fingers slid right inside me.</p> <p>I felt his thumb dip inside me and slowly massage my swollen clit, sending waves of pleasure through me. My hips rocked against his hand as his thumb stroked across my g-spot. I knew I wouldn't last very long, and I knew I wouldn't be able to stop him from making me explode if I weren't so drunk.</p> <p>"I want you."</p> <p>"Oh, yes."</p> <p>He kissed my forehead, and reached down between my legs with his free hand to stroke my now dripping wet clit once again. He could have just pulled his hand away right then and left me like that...</p> <p>But I had a lot to lose. I'd thought the alcohol had loosened me up a little. And this was a new experience for both of us.</p> <p>He took a breath and pushed me back on the bed before positioning himself so I was on my back, and I felt his mouth on me. Just a feather light touch, a feathery touch, and I felt goosebumps spring to my skin. He started with slow kisses all over my breasts and stomach, and I could feel goosebumps all over and even in my sex.</p> <p>Then the tongue traced all the way up to my pussy lips. He made a few light licks before he kissed my clit, and then he wrapped his lips around it, and my body jumped a little. I felt his fingers touch my clit again, then gently but firmly massaged it.</p> <p>"Oh, god, yes," I managed to stutter out as he circled my clit with his tongue, then moved to nibble it lightly. "Oh, yes. Oh god, that feels good."</p> <p>"Do you like that?" he moaned, moving his hands down to my knees.</p> <p>"Oh, god, yes."</p> <p>He spread my thighs and looked at me. I felt him kneel between them and his dick rub against my thigh. It slid into me again. Just a half-inch at first.</p> <p>"Mmm... do you want me to go slow?"</p> <p>"Yes. God, yes."</p> <p>He slowly slid his dick into me and then stopped, just an inch inside me. I had to let out a moan, and as my body adjusted to him, he stopped a little too soon before he entered me fully.</p> <p>"Ohhh, god."</p> <p>"Are you okay?" I groaned.</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"That's not a good sign. That's cheating."</p> <p>He stopped moving slowly within me, and moved his body up, laying on him. He wrapped his arms around me, and I put my arms around him and my legs around his waist. As he continued sliding in and out of me, I felt his hard dick slide down to the bottom of my channel. His pace picked up as we kissed more passionately and passionately. His kisses made my body rock with lust, and I could feel his dick sliding between my legs.</p> <p>I started to get nervous for a second, feeling the pressure that was building inside of me, and then my mind drifted back to his kisses, the feel of his cock moving deep within me. I knew that this was going to be a long night. Our bodies were covered in goosebumps, and my sex felt like it was going to explode.</p> <p>My body began to tense a little, then relax before me. My back began to arch and I let out a moan. My hands found the back of his neck and I began to softly push our bodies together. His tongue was suddenly on my own tongue, which seemed to melt into me.</p> <p>As he began to increase his tempo, I felt my insides start to burn as if he were tearing through me. I knew I was going to cum. I felt my insides start to tighten, and then I felt myself start to cum. I felt my back arch, my body thrust and then convulse with an orgasm of my own.</p> <p>I think both of us were completely drunk by this point, but we were definitely both in a state of intoxication, and it didn't seem to matterâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
