His soft cock was nudging her leg as he stroked and squeezed her asscheek cheeks.</p> <p>She opened her eyes, blinked, then met his.”I… I guess this is a good chance for us to…” she trailed off.</p> <p>“It’s not like I’ve got to be your boy and you can be my man.”</p> <p>“You mean… I don’t know if I feel…like I have to keep being just…”</p> <p>“It is going to be okay,” he assured her. “If we keep this up, our relationship here will be over, and you’ll probably marry and live just as happily as you always used to.”</p> <p>“You better believe it!” she said. “Let’s get back to the bedroom.”</p> <p>They went back to the bedroom and took off their clothes. As soon as she’d shed hers she laid back on the bed as she spread her legs, showing off what a sexy woman she was.</p> <p>“Do you want me?” he asked.</p> <p>“Yeah!”</p> <p>He approached her and ran a finger between her inner labia, dipping it inside.</p> <p>“Ohhhh!” she groaned and lifted her hips. “Yes!”</p> <p>He slid her into the chair and came up behind her.</p> <p>“Don’t go slow.” He pushed down on her waist so that he was pressing between her legs.</p> <p>“Mmmm,” she cooed. “I like that.”</p> <p>He began to kiss and suck her neck, working closer and closer to her mouth with every kiss. She moved her mouth up to his earlobe and whispered,</p> <p>“Let’s do this a little at a time. Slow down, just a little.”</p> <p>Her hot pussy dripped on his thigh as she slowly rotated her hips and tried to move herself back to him.</p> <p>“No.” She breathed as she felt a finger slide along the inside of her thigh. A second finger joined the first inside her.</p> <p>“God,” she whimpered. “Please!” She moved up on the bed. “Please!” she moaned again.</p> <p>“Say it.”</p> <p>“Please, please, please, please, please, please!” she begged.</p> <p>“Please what, love?’.”</p> <p>She cried out again, then moaned incoherently.”My tits, please my tits… oh God, please…”</p> <p>He pulled her body back a little and she began humping back against him, trying to get his cock inside of her. She couldn’t believe she was responding to him and she didn’t care. He was getting to her.</p> <p>He slipped a digit inside her and she pushed back harder against him.</p> <p>“Say my name.”</p> <p>“Yes, lover! Say my name.”</p> <p>He slid the first finger in and then began moving his hand and fingers in unison. He began to finger her again, then brought his hand up to her mouth.</p> <p>“My mouth, please my mouth…” she cried.</p> <p>“No, not until I get to the bottom of the slope. I need your pussy to lick.”</p> <p>“Your mouth?” she cried. She shook again, then cried as he slid two fingers inside her.</p> <p>“What about my mouth, sweetie?”</p> <p>“Please!” she cried as he slid his tongue against the nub of her clit.</p> <p>“Don’t wait,” he whispered. “I want you to go down on me.”</p> <p>She did.</p> <p>“How do I taste?” he asked. “Mmm.”</p> <p>She did. She loved the taste of herself.</p> <p>“Oh, I love your taste.”</p> <p>“Oh—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
