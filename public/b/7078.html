If this turned out right, I was sure that I would never see her again. Not right here, not now. It was an eternity, a few minutes more before I felt my cock begin to stiffen again. I had already cum three times and I was already ready for another.</p> <p>"I need it!" I almost yelled. And I had. I needed it harder.</p> <p>I pushed her off me and laid her back against the blanket, pushing her hips up against her body as she reached out and grabbed my arms. Without waiting, I pulled her panties off and threw them on the same blanket that she had been wearing, and pulled them off, throwing them on the next.</p> <p>We lay there in each others arms in the dark, just taking it all in. I still wanted her but I didn't want to push it. I had gotten enough of that. It was wrong, I knew, but this was good at its end and I couldn't go back.</p> <p>"I need this right now," I said before I began to kiss her.</p> <p>I held a hand down on the bed for balance while she continued to make out with me.</p> <p>Once she put her right leg up over the side of the bed, I slid my left hand down and found it. With my fingers, I began to lightly massage her clit as we continued this little make out session. She didn't stop me; she simply let her legs spread as my fingers began to stroke her pussy even as we continued to make out. She leaned back against my hand and we continued to make out as we continued to slowly, erotically move our fingers against each other. She had stopped making out a little because I was getting desperate, but I couldn't deny it. I wanted her. I had to have her.</p> <p>Finally I broke the kiss and went around to the top of the bed, pulling back the pillow and getting her onto her back. With one hand, I found a position that I could take, and with the other hand, I pulled her legs apart, sliding down between her legs while still teasing her clit. Her hips moved up towards me, giving an inviting invitation. I leaned in and gave her the most sensual kiss I'd ever given in my life.</p> <p>"I've missed this," she said, as her legs grabbed my body again and pulled me toward her.</p> <p>"I've missed you too," I whispered, as she arched herself up toward me.</p> <p>She didn't make contact, but I found myself getting more and more turned on by it. I could smell the clean scent of her wetness as my hand slid along her thigh.</p> <p>"Is this how you have been waiting all day," she said. "For that, I want you."</p> <p>She started to kiss me again, and her hands started to rub my body as well.</p> <p>"When was the last time you made love, and did you cum," she asked, her voice breaking.</p> <p>"A couple of times," I replied, trying to put my arms around her and pulling her close.</p> <p>"Did you make yourself cum?" she asked, as her hands began to rub my chest. "How about me tonight?," she said, as she started to straddle my torso and I could feel her thighs slide down into mine and then up again.</p> <p>"If you want," I answered with a grin.</p> <p>"Good" she laughed, as her pussy pressed against me and let her hips press the length and aching length of my dick.</p> <p>I continued to kiss her as she ground against me, while her hands continued to work on me until I was ready to cum. I was still trying to make sure the condom worked but not wanting to push her over the edge until I had a chance to cum.</p> <p>"You need to turn around," I said.</p> <p>"Is it too late," she asked, her eyes sparkling.</p> <p>"I'm getting there, damn you."</p> <p>"I've been waiting for this, too, aren't I," she said, pushing her body against mine, her hips thrusting upward as she lowered her pussy on to my dick.</p> <p>"Yes, I want the same thing," I whispered against her lips, kissing her as I began to gently stroke her hips.</p> <p>"I am your sex toy, and you are my toy," she whispered back, and her mouth left mine as she lifted her eyes to mine and stared to say something while still grinding her hips.</p> <p>I continued to stroke her hips slowly as she began to grind her pussy harder against me. Her eyes closed and she leaned back against me and kissed me before she moved her mouth to my ear and began to whisper,</p> <p>"Fuck me."</p> <p>"Oh, Godâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
