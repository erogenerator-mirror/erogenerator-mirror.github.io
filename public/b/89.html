You may want to go now, and call back in a few."</p> <p>I walked around the house, noticing it was now a bit chilly, and my skirt had ridden up my legs. I took out my phone and called back. I heard her laughing, my hands were shaking.</p> <p>She said, "Well hello, Jack, I see you finally got the idea, we have a party starting at six."</p> <p>I told her I was on the way and took her hand.</p> <p>I couldn't believe it, but I had done them both!</p> <p>"Well, I'm really glad you finally got it out of your system! We've been trying for awhile to get a way to get you to join in the party. I am so glad you're here for this party. You'll be seeing some of my friends soon, so relax for a while."</p> <p>Her voice was so sweet. I kissed her softly on the cheek and asked, "So, if you're not too busy all I have to do is tell my parents we're going to be friends!"</p> <p>She said yes, she'd always liked talking to me and I liked hearing from her. What a wonderful person.</p> <p>The house was really nice. The house looked to me like my dad and mom's. It fit in perfectly with my life. A really nice house! Everything is great! I was very happy with my new life!</p> <p>"Would you like to help me out with one of my girls?" I asked.</p> <p>"How do I turn you on, Jack?" she asked.</p> <p>"I really don't know, but I guess I could go if you say, and then we'll see."</p> <p>She knew that was fine. I'd just have to find out myself!</p> <p>A few minutes later, a really cool looking black guy entered my house, and introduced himself as Bob.</p> <p>"Hello Jack, this is Bob"</p> <p>"Jack, nice to meet you. What are we doing tonight?" he asked.</p> <p>I asked him, "What are you doing tonight?"</p> <p>"Well, I've always wanted to see a stripper, so I wanted to meet you first."</p> <p>"And I thought you could help me out with a few of the girls? What's your name?"</p> <p>"Jack"</p> <p>"Bob"</p> <p>"Would you please get some beer, and some alcohol for us. I'm sure the girls would love to meet you!"</p> <p>I thought of the offer, but I figured I'd have at least a couple of shots, and maybe a blowjob in the back! What did I have to be afraid of, she was a total ditz!</p> <p>We sat for a short time, talking about the party. A bit of alcohol, and a few new friends, before we started drinking. We all talked about my family, my parents, and the sex I'd gone through with my stepdad.</p> <p>Bob, I think, is really into cock sucking and he would love to show you what a cock sucker a cock sucker is."</p> <p>"Sounds amazing, but Bob said he wanted to show you what a cock sucker is all about!" the little redheaded gal said.</p> <p>"That would be great, but I'm not sure I should be doing this," I said. As they were talking I had to get a grip, I didn't want to lose my chance of getting laid tonight. It was kind of a crazy idea. Maybe it was good for me to have it out with them?</p> <p>"So, why don't you get the beer, and we can talk some more later, later on tonight. We just had a nice bottle of wine, and to get some shots I should probably come with a friend." said Bob.</p> <p>I gave Bob another look, and he gave me his beer. He had a smile on his face, but his eyes were looking down. I could tell he's been with girls before, probably because they were very nice.</p> <p>"Ok, you can't leave now. You need to come with me, so we won't be interrupted."</p> <p>"Thank you! I really enjoyed it this time." He said.</p> <p>We all talked some more, then I invited them to dinner, followed by a few more beers. I could really get into the night, and the alcohol was beginning to kick in. I really needed a break, it was about the only thing I could come up with.</p> <p>My sister Lisa came over and put her arms around me while I held her, she was still very drunk.</p> <p>"Jack, I was really happy to see you, and hoped to come with you tonight!" She said as she ran her hands over my back and neck.</p> <p>"Well, I think we'll really enjoy working out, after all work really hardâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
