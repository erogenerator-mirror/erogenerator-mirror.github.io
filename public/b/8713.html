I can't even imagine what this is going to look like," replied Katie uncertainly.</p> <p>She could feel the light flush of excitement at the thought of being seen out by a bunch of strangers just a few yards away from her. The thought of being seen like this, especially by a woman... it was a huge turn on.</p> <p>"Well I'll have to be a little bit careful," Emily said, her cheeks flushing pink with excitement.</p> <p>"Okay." responded Katie slowly.</p> <p>"Now we're getting somewhere," Katie said with a laugh.</p> <p>"What you're going to do is do a little shopping?" Emily asked with a laugh too.</p> <p>"I don't want to do anything I don't want to do. Just buy a few things together with the car, okay?"</p> <p>"Oh I love shopping," Emily smiled.</p> <p>"Are you buying anything?" Katie said suddenly, looking at her quizzically.</p> <p>"Oh hell no. Why buy? What would I pick for you?"</p> <p>"Well you," answered Katie, grinning. "I want to buy an accessory that I just bought you. Do you know what that is?"</p> <p>"No! I haven't heard any salesmen mention it in a long time," Emily stated.</p> <p>"It's just jewelry," added Katie. "So you buy them for the car to go to the mall? Or do you just buy something from someone I know? I thought we were going to do a little shopping," asked Emily.</p> <p>"I don't know," replied Emily, her eyebrows now raised as Katie looked on.</p> <p>"Well, it's only a small thing," said Katie. "Just something to wear, okay? And what's the occasion?" asked Emily, trying to play off the strange outfit.</p> <p>"We... we got a nice little home," stated Katie in surprise. "But we just bought it, remember? So you can't actually buy things for the car."</p> <p>"Yeah, I should probably just say that we bought you a present, sweetheart, as well," responded Emily, her heart pounding.</p> <p>"I'm not saying we should wait in the car," teased Katie.</p> <p>"Okay... okay. We can look at it. If you wanted to, you'll just have to wait in your car," Emily insisted. "You know, there's only one place we haven't already spent the car's money on. There's an open bar down the street," offered Katie.</p> <p>"Okay," said Emily as the look of nervousness she was feeling intensified.</p> <p>"And you can even have a drink," added Katie with a grin.</p> <p>"What?" asked Emily.</p> <p>"We bought you a drink a while ago, sweetie. This way we'll be able to look at all those things together," responded Katie.</p> <p>"You're a lifesaver, Emily," Emily replied, looking at her friend to understand how they'd end up staying at a public place like a two-dollar bar in a city with no bars or bars.</p> <p>"I guess you're right. I was just making sure we got a good night's sleep when you went to bed," laughed Katie.</p> <p>"It's just that all the time, you know?" stated Emily with a wry face.</p> <p>"Oh come on, there's not time for a drink right now," Katie retorted.</p> <p>"Okay, okay. We'll just talk about it for a while and then you can go home and talk to the kids," replied Emily.</p> <p>"But the first thing I have to do is go out and buy a drink."</p> <p>"That was an unexpected development," protested Katie.</p> <p>"Yeah, and I'm not buying anything. I don't want to buy alcohol when I'm spending money to buy something," said Emily, her hands still nervously shaking. "Do you have any idea what it's like out drinking for a while?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, we really should try and buy something together," replied Katie, her eyes wide with fear.</p> <p>"Can I buy you one?" asked Emily, her tone of voice breaking with fear.</p> <p>"Yes! Oh God no! I can't!" cried Katie.</p> <p>"Don't worry honey. I'll buy her one, and she can get drunk with just one drink first," said Emily.</p> <p>"No, wait," called Katie.</p> <p>Emily held out a small piece of cloth that she had put on over Katie's head.
