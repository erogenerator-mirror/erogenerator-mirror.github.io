I didn't give you much to worry about, you're a good sport, thank you very much."</p> <p>I nodded but I wasn't ready to give up either.</p> <p>I was standing in the lounge, with the guy in the room beside him taking a seat on the leather loveseat beside me.</p> <p>I turned to him, "Would you mind if I came over and sat here and rested for a bit? I know you're not as good as you appear."</p> <p>With that he gave me a quick kiss on the cheek and stood to head off.</p> <p>He went straight into the fridge, opened it to get himself a cold drink and sat down on top. I followed suit without saying a word.</p> <p>I stood to walk over to him and gave him a quick, peck on the lips. I looked into his eyes, "Thank you for taking me on board."</p> <p>He didn't seem to mind, "Your welcome." He then turned his gaze to the guy on the loveseat.</p> <p>"Well, have a look round the rest of it and we'll see if your staying here too."</p> <p>He then turned.</p> <p>I went to look for his car, it was still open for him.</p> <p>In a short time we were getting back on the plane and he gave me one more kiss, "Thank you so much; for everything. You're a very good-looking young man and I knew you'd do well with a job, just don't let on that you're an executive."</p> <p>My thoughts then moved on to a further question. "You were all for me, were you, and have ever had, um, been with other men in the past?"</p> <p>His face was now serious again, "Well, no of course not," he then leaned in to give me a peck on the cheek, "I don't think I've ever had anyone else. It's not that I am not adventurous, I am and I love a variety of sex. I just cannot resist having something more in mind while I still can."</p> <p>We both said a soft, "Wow."</p> <p>He gave me a quick peck on the lips again.</p> <p>I then said, "You're really not as well off as I thought you'd be, but it's never bothered me; I really enjoyed the evening."</p> <p>"Really?" he asked me, "I certainly enjoyed it."</p> <p>I thought, he really did like what he was hearing.</p> <p>I turned and kissed a cheek, "It was very pleasant indeed. I suppose you wouldn't want to?"</p> <p>He then kissed me again, "Are you kidding?"</p> <p>I had never said that to a guy before, I thought it's one of the easiest things to do to get him to back off.</p> <p>We kissed for a moment, "I don't have to," he said finally reluctantly.</p> <p>"You don't have to? You're good for more than one thing."</p> <p>He gave me that serious look again.</p> <p>I then said, "Thank you," and we both smiled at each other.</p> <p>He then gave me a quick peck, "Thank you for being so understanding."</p> <p>We both smiled at each other again, "See you in a little while."</p> <p>We got up before the plane to go get my bag to collect my stuff from the baggage area, I was really impressed that I could sit down and go through with this.</p> <p>I then stood outside the airport and started the car and headed for home.</p> <p>Driving home I thought, "I'm really starting to think on my life, the way things have turned out, this has been my dream to have a relationship and hopefully have a future with an older man."</p> <p>My emotions were flowing out of control. There was a part of me that was looking forward to a future, there was a part of me that was looking forward to him being my lover and manhood.</p> <p>I sat there on the couch for a while. The butterflies in my stomach were threatening to explode. When the car was parked in its parking lot I went up stairs to change and went to the bar to get a drink and take one of the many walks through the mall to the shops I had to pick up and buy.</p> <p>I had just got back upstairs when I heard him come out of the house. When he didn't come in I took off my coat and walked over to him to give him a huge hugâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
