"I promise I'll be very discreet."</p> <p>"Great," he said simply and began walking back to his house in silence.</p> <p>The next day at work I was distracted by my boss at the counter, not noticing that my boss was staring intently at me. I was in a daze from the moment that I had been called in into my work, and was going over a report when it was time to switch to my supervisor's desk. It was when I was getting a report that the shift in my department began.</p> <p>While I was working late that day, my supervisor was out, so I assumed that my work would stop immediately after I was done. I started on my report and had an idea of what to do. As I finished I looked up to see that his eyes weren't as large as they should have been, the first time I noticed them. His gaze rested on me the entire time as he worked. He seemed to be having trouble concentrating on my paper, staring at my exposed thigh.</p> <p>I took a large swallow of my coffee and cleared my throat. I was distracted by how my boss seemed to look at me, but before he could react I looked up at him and smiled. Our smile immediately turned into a full blown laugh.</p> <p>"Are you alright by yourself," I asked as I looked over the work finished article. "Did you get any complaints?"</p> <p>"Nothing," he laughed and looked back at his paper. "What about me?"</p> <p>"Sorry, I'll try to find another job to cover for you."</p> <p>"No, wait, we can't."</p> <p>"You're still so young," he said with a smile.</p> <p>He had a twinkle in his eye.</p> <p>"You are, aren't you?"</p> <p>"No, not really." There was a slight quaver in his voice as he said it.</p> <p>"No, there's nothing that's either, either."</p> <p>"No, I'm quite ok."</p> <p>"But I should tell you," he said, as if just realizing what he had said. "I mean, I know I can't see my face in the papers, but don't worry, you'll see me."</p> <p>"You should," I whispered.</p> <p>He leaned against my desk and leaned forward as he brought his arm around my waist.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful," he whispered as he placed both hands on my shoulder and squeezed gently.</p> <p>I couldn't help myself. I leaned my head to the side, trying to keep his lips from crushing mine. His kiss was too soft and warm to be sweet and it left me feeling weak in the knees.</p> <p>Slowly he pulled his head back and smiled down at me. His eyes were a deep brown, almost black. His lips and cheeks were full and soft to the touch. I leaned back and placed my hand on the counter behind me as my arms went around his neck. His mouth followed mine in a light trail as he took my chin in his hand and brought my lips back down to meet mine. The taste of him was sweet and strong as his lips pressed against mine. Our kisses were slow and sensual, our tongues exploring each other. I could feel his hard cock underneath his jeans and I had to have him inside me right then and there. I wanted more of him.</p> <p>I couldn't believe what I was doing. My whole body felt as if I was on fire - I needed more than coffee right then. I needed to feel his flesh against mine, to wrap my legs around him as he plunged his cock into me with one smooth motion. My fingers tightened as my legs began to shake. He had started to kiss me on the top of my head and I could feel his strength and desire beginning to peak.</p> <p>Slowly at first, his kisses had become more and more sensual as I got more and more aroused. My hips moved to his crotch, trying to find his hardness.</p> <p>"Let go," he said with a husky tone in my ear as our kisses continued. "Let go."</p> <p>My arms slipped around his neck as I moaned into his mouth. My legs began to tremble as his tongue probed my mouth, exploring every crevice and crevice in my mouth.</p> <p>Slowly, his kiss deepened as his hand slipped up my skirt, his fingers teasing at my clit as his tongue moved faster, circling my mouth as it slid from my mouth. I pressed my hand harder against his neck as my body began to arch upwards and my pussy began to leak on his fingers.</p> <p>He broke our kiss and leaned backâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
