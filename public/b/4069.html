She had been working all day and was out in the garden, wearing only shorts and a tank top, which exposed her tits to anyone who might be looking. Her long blonde hair was down and her glasses were off, so she looked like a college girl and wore her hair down. In her right hand was a briefcase she had brought along for her stay with her. She picked up her shirt and dropped it on the floor, and was surprised at how neat her back was. Just as well that her bra had not caught on.</p> <p>She finished her shopping and left her car at the front door, and turned toward the front door. The front door was locked, and she thought she heard noises, but instead she saw the back of a dark shape in the house, and her heart stopped for a moment. She tried to back out of the house some way, but found herself unable to do so.</p> <p>The man had a big smile on his face, and they stood there looking each other over, a serious expression on his face. Before she knew what was happening, another shadow was looming over her in the hallway and suddenly her eyes were wide in shock. Her voice rose as she said, "I'm so sorry."</p> <p>"No need to apologize. I just was shocked. I'm sure you aren't the only one looking. They always do. Anyway, thank you for helping me."</p> <p>"It wasn't my intention to bring someone else to help me, so I think we should be going. Now," he said, pulling on just a towel around his waist. "It would just be polite if you come. I'll show you into the bathroom and I'll put the things away."</p> <p>With that, he walked off without looking in her direction, still smiling as he went. After all, what was a girl to do at a funeral? She thought, with a slight sinking feeling in her stomach. She turned to see where he was going, her stomach fluttering in anticipation.</p> <p>The bathroom was small, with just one sink and a toilet on a small counter with a mirror. The mirrors were about eight feet long and three feet wide, but were only a few feet from floor to ceiling. She was so surprised to see a mirror that she couldn't move. "Come on in," she said, even though she had to stand there in the small bathroom. She had to admit, she was feeling a little nervous. She figured this was what she wanted to do. This time, she thought, she would be in control. Her mind went back to what she had seen that afternoon at the pool. She couldn't imagine how great was it to be that far up that long and it looked so long and hard that it looked like her.</p> <p>The man closed the door behind her, and then proceeded to undress. She couldn't believe that he had just gone and dressed, he was so handsome. She admired his body for maybe ten seconds, thinking of the times he and her used to be naked, but for once, the image of his cock and balls didn't matter to the moment. He had to be at least eight or nine inches long, and that was just so big that it was hard to get a good look at it. The sight of it made her feel a little giddy and self-conscious, wondering what the size would be, but she couldn't get rid of it.</p> <p>His pants dropped to the floor, revealing a pair of black boxer briefs, but that was all. His cock was a little longer and thicker than she wanted, probably eight in length. She imagined how it was going to feel entering her. She couldn't wait to feel him inside her. The thought of his cock sliding inside her was enough to drive her wild. She stepped forward in her underwear, her eyes wide in the dim light which was just coming through the mirror. She was shaking and her heart had just been pounding out of her chest. She held the bra that was hanging from her neck, trying to cover up her chest which was a few inches above it. The thin straps caught on one side of her nipples, making them more erect. She was afraid if she pulled the bra up they would rip right off her, so she grabbed the cloth, the bra straps that fell over her shoulders, and pulled it up and put it on. It was tight, but she didn't think she would need it. She thought he might have to think of something to go with the shirt though. She figured he might have to think of something.
