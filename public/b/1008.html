Then, just at that moment, the sound of the bell and the sound of the bell was all that was left for the day. It would be one of the only three remaining hours of any kind that my poor wife could get to be comfortable.</p> <p>"What the hell?" I asked myself as my mind began to wander.</p> <p>I was on the bed when I heard the bell and felt a little panic rise in my stomach. I was wondering to myself about my wife being alone in the house. Then I became very aware that I felt quite upset...and then I began to feel a little bit of relief about it also.</p> <p>I had no idea of what was about to happen. I felt as though a lot of things were at work in my being and on the other hand, the day began to happen pretty nicely.</p> <p>I awoke with a start. I was just lying there feeling rather guilty and embarrassed about the way my wife and I acted.</p> <p>My wife had walked into the room and sat up on the bed, looking at me.</p> <p>"What did you do?" she asked.</p> <p>"Nothing that I couldn't...at least not with you!" I told her. I was a bit of a rambunctious sort to begin with, and I never really tried to keep anything at an early minimum. I was never especially good at talking, and as it turned out, that was no reason not to get along with me.</p> <p>"It's no big deal!...I mean, I get a lot of the sex I want...but when it comes to it, you're the expert!" I said trying to joke with her.</p> <p>"Okay...and that brings me back..." she replied.</p> <p>I started to get up and go to bed...I really hoped she wouldn't mind.</p> <p>It was around the same time that I got my pants back on and the door to our house opened. I think you know what she'd looked like. She was about 5', maybe a little smaller but very attractive. The hair had come out a bit, but the face was still pretty nice, although not as pretty looking as her lovely tits.</p> <p>We smiled as we went by her room, and it seemed like the next time that we walked past, she would catch me looking. I would blush whenever we passed her room, but I could hardly look her over. It seemed rather silly to do so, after all, I was going to have quite a fun night.</p> <p>I could feel my cock getting erect as I walked.</p> <p>"So, what are you going to do the rest of the night?" I asked her.</p> <p>"I don't know, but I don't think it's a bad idea!" she replied and continued.</p> <p>"And when you get home, when you finally do get to see me, will it give you a lot of courage?" I asked her.</p> <p>She shook her head vigorously, "It's not that I don't want to stay here, in my mind it would give me a lot of comfort. I'm afraid my heart would break."</p> <p>"Do you have some other plans for that evening?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Maybe. I'm afraid I just might get the opportunity to take it to new heights in my life." She said smiling at me.</p> <p>She took both me and my jacket with her and went ahead, and I could not help but notice that she was wearing a pretty lacy bra and panty set. She was obviously excited about something, and I guess that showed.</p> <p>When we returned to the house after breakfast my mind was in over drive, but I was so excited at the prospect of my date with my wife that I couldn't even begin to think about trying to keep my cock from getting any harder.</p> <p>My plan was to spend the rest of the evening at home, and just get to bed when I finally had the courage. Or should I say the opportunity to keep a hard cock from getting any harder? I think that part was down to my excitement...and the way my mind raced on the road I was making.</p> <p>I was having more success than I ever thought possible, and had been getting very turned on thinking about her undressing me and having her pussy exposed for me to do with it...</p> <p>She was just too gorgeous. I found myself just wanting to be with her, and I had been fantasizing about seeing her naked, and seeing my wife naked...well...that's what I was...the voyeur. I had been staring at her, fantasizing about seeing her without clothes and feeling her breasts and feeling her warm, naked body and her wonderful flesh.</p> <p>Her breasts and pussy wereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
