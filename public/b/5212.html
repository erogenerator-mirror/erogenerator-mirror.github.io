I asked as I leaned against her, both of us still completely naked.</p> <p>"I don't know..." she blushed, "I know the time that we met at the club has been...great. You have been pretty good at looking out for each other, but it seemed like you were just taking everything in," she said defensively.</p> <p>"I'm glad you like what you see," I said, "but I was a little surprised too."</p> <p>"Really?" she said, not opening up, "Well, that's my fault," she admitted.</p> <p>"That's okay," I comforted her, "Let me tell you about myself."</p> <p>I opened her notebook.</p> <p>I had a brief encounter with the internet a few years before with many of the people there. It was a few years before my ex and I met when I moved. I was there to help keep things going.</p> <p>"Well...I guess it was kind of a hit then, you know. I mean, I was kind of an outsider who didn't have enough friends or family around here."</p> <p>"It's okay, that's part of your problem, I'm sure," she answered.</p> <p>She had a point so I asked:</p> <p>"How was it that you had found out I liked the site," I asked.</p> <p>"Well, it's kind of like talking about our friendship with our friends. We've had some really nice friends, and it's kind of a turn on to just be able to really talk and really be with each other for just a day or so. It's been such a big turn-on for me."</p> <p>"Do you do it for a living?" she asked.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Well, do it for fun. I mean, don't get me wrong, it does sound great, but I thought you would be a real good, honest man, and you can come up with something real fun for us to do. Maybe we could go shopping together sometime," she offered.</p> <p>"I thought that it was great for me too," I replied, "I have been looking forward to this chance to try a little bondage and domination. Being able to have some fun that I can really enjoy. Maybe not just with a toy, but a woman I can really make into my sub."</p> <p>She thought about that and said:</p> <p>"Hmmm...that's one option," she said, "but there's another."</p> <p>"What's another?" I asked, "The domination and submission to actually having a woman dominate and submit to me?"</p> <p>"Oh yeah. I have been enjoying the idea of you tying me up," she admitted.</p> <p>"A women tied up? What's that?" I asked.</p> <p>"Just a woman tied up in bondage, so helpless as to be powerless to do anything she doesn't want to do."</p> <p>"Wow," I said.</p> <p>"Hmmm," she replied, "we know where this is going."</p> <p>We continued our conversation, both of us telling each other how we felt about the idea of trying a woman dominate a man, or having an experience of being fucked by a man at the mercy of him. It was very erotic.</p> <p>"I'm not sure that I understand how we're so different," Laura said after we finished our coffee, "but I think we both know there's a lot more going on in our lives than just talking."</p> <p>"We could try that too," I said, "and we could talk and learn a lot about ourselves as a couple."</p> <p>"Wow," she answered, "and we could get into a lot more trouble."</p> <p>She looked at me and said, "Do you think that's possible with a woman?"</p> <p>"That's one of the things that we talked about in college. It's almost like it's a phase that we both want to go through."</p> <p>"I'm sure."</p> <p>"Why don't you sit down." I directed her, "I think we can set up some toys so that you will be open to some fun stuff. Let's use this one," I said, and handed her our vibrator. "It'll be pretty good, if that is what you're worried about."</p> <p>She sat and put it in her hand.</p> <p>"This will make it easierâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
