"Now I don't want to taste you." She said with a wink, and then sucked my cock back into her mouth and gave me a quick blowjob. She sucked me fast and deep, taking several long, hard minutes before releasing me, and then rolling her tongue across the head. She was clearly enjoying herself. A little embarrassed, but not as much as before. She started to stroke my shaft a little more vigorously now.</p> <p>"God, you know how to drive a girl crazy," she said. "Do me again, please." My hand went around her head and guided her to my dick again, this time going with a little more rhythm and a lot more attention.</p> <p>"I told you I wasn't going to last long." I was about to argue, but her fingers slipped into her mouth and she whispered in my ear. "That's all you got, isn't it, Baby?" She whispered right in my ear and pulled me by the belt as she pumped me hard and fast. "I want you in all of me. I want to fuck myself with you."</p> <p>I didn't argue that one bit. This was definitely turning me on more than I had gotten from the previous couple of months. I gave my cock a couple strokes and she pulled away as I was ready to blow. "Come on Baby, shoot it in me. Give it to me!" She looked up at me. I thought she might be angry, but she smiled. "You're just as much to blame as me, and now is not the time to be nasty. I can't just let you cum in her mouth and run off on her like that."</p> <p>I shot my load on her cheek, chin, and right breast, and she rubbed the wetness all over it. Finally, spent, it dribbled down her chest slowly and she leaned up, her breasts, stomach and thighs glistening with my cum.</p> <p>It's not even 12:00 in the morning, she looked at me with those baby blues again, and gave my cock one last squeeze with her hands. "It looks like it's getting hot." She wiped her face with her hand and sat up, leaning up against the counter. "I think I can see that you did a good job."</p> <p>There was that phrase again. You can't fuck any longer without giving me that phrase. If I think that's going to be a big turn on for you before, I could do it again. "Well, I couldn't have asked for better timing." I got on my knees and grabbed her shoulders to lift her towards me, and I was almost in her again. We made love like that again and she whispered, "My turn."</p> <p>For that extra bit of power, she flipped over on her back. "I could use a little more power. That was fun. I love a woman who wants to be in charge," I said as I spread her legs and dove right in. I didn't just lick her, I lapped at her pussy. I had her hips turned towards me, and the feeling of her tight pussy lips on my tongue was too much to ignore.</p> <p>And then she started the "fuck, fuck, fuck" pattern again. "That's good Baby, that's good. I want to fuck you. I want to see you come." I was really horny enough now, so I just focused on her clit. After a couple of seconds, she was really going, and it was just the feel of her body rocking against mine that got me going. "Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, that's it Baby, that's it," she was crying. "That's so good Baby. I love you." That encouraged me, and I kept licking her until she collapsed. We lay there for a minute or two, catching our breath, and then she said, "That was wonderful. That was so perfect."</p> <p>I leaned over her and held her close in my arms. We held each other until our bodies were almost chafed, but I couldn't keep my hands off of her. "How long was that," I whispered to her.</p> <p>"Oh, Baby, that wasn't so bad. I was so happy to have a man like you." She laughed. "It was so wild."</p> <p>I couldn't help but smile. "And what were you doing, while I was feeling sorry for you?"</p> <p>"Well, I was making love to you, but it was mostly you." She paused to rub my cheek with her fingers. "You were feeling horny too, weren't you?" She asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, you're a really horny woman. It's been pretty wild, in the past couple of months."</p> <p>"I know, Baby, I'm feeling realâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
