I replied, "Just keep the drinks coming." I took a long swig of my drink, then sat down on the edge of my bed.</p> <p>"That's nice," said Amy. I could see her nipples already pressing against the cotton-front of her negligee, and she was starting to squirm slightly in her reclining position. She slipped her hand down the gown and into the waistband of her panties before sliding a finger to her clit, gently rubbing it as she leaned close and let me sip a little more of my drink. She pulled her fingers away, and took another sip, pushing her finger back into her pussy as she looked up at me. Then she leaned in, pressing her lips to mine as she kissed me, her tongue pushing deep into my mouth as she pressed her tits against my chest. As we kissed, her hand dropped down to my semi-erect cock, pulling out a little of the foreskin, leaving her lips and tongue fully engorged as she stroked the flesh, bringing it to full hardness in seconds.</p> <p>"How does it feel?" she whispered between kissing me.</p> <p>"Mmmm," I answered. "Just feels a little strange."</p> <p>"Don't worry about it," she replied, "I just like doing this to people." I heard her breathing become a little deeper. "Besides, I want you to come for me. I've been planning to come for years."</p> <p>"But I've never been able to..."</p> <p>"Hush. I just want to watch you. I don't mind if you let yourself come." She released her finger from my lips, and pushed a couple of fingers into her pussy as she stroked her clit. Then she pulled it free, rubbing it against her nipple as she reached out and cupped her left tit. It was already erect, firm and heavy, and as she ran her hand over her nipple, I could easily make out the shape of her nipple through the material. "What about you? Does it hurt?" she asked.</p> <p>"No, it's just..." I couldn't believe it and didn't really know what to say. For just a moment, her finger pressed against her clit, causing her to gasp and arch her back. "It's just that..." I couldn't let my cock go if it came out. So I pulled up the covers and climbed under the covers. I lay between her legs and spread the lips of her pussy, running my tongue along the wet and swollen lips. She lifted her knees up high and spread her legs wide. She was as wet as she had ever been, and I could hear a little sound as I pressed my tongue deep inside her cunt, licking off the juices of her orgasm. I could smell her sex from here; so strong and musky, with the slightly musty aroma of raw meat. I licked her there for a long time before she pulled me up.</p> <p>"You have a lovely tongue." She looked into my eyes as she ran a finger across my lips. "I can also taste your cock" she added. I was surprised. I'd heard of people doing that, but I was sure I hadn't enjoyed it very much. "I have tasted it before, and I'm sure you haven't but I'd love to," she said. "Mmm... I'd even like to taste you again."</p> <p>I was only too happy to oblige. This was really the first time I'd ever done something like this with anyone, and I was quite unsure about what to do or not to do, so I was careful to keep it short and teasing as we lay back on the bed, her head on my chest, her left leg over mine as she lay between my legs. I ran my hand across her back, cupping her as I did so, feeling the softness of her skin underneath, moving my hand up and down slightly as I did so. The smell of her pussy was very strong in this room, as was the feel of her nipple in my hand. I couldn't help myself. I was getting so turned on and I felt like I was about to come before my cock would, if it had any more, got any harder at all. Before she'd even got started, I was pushing myself up to her, and she was rolling onto her back as I pressed my stiff member into her in one swift movement, feeling its bulbous head rub across her pussy lips. I felt the wet softness of her pussy walls as I sank myself deep inside her, causing her to gasp and throw her head back, eyes looking at me through heavy eyelids as my cock filled her up, her own head resting on the pillow as she lay panting for a minute or so as the sensations ran through her body.</p> <p>"What was that again?" she asked, pulling her head up slightly and looking into my eyesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
