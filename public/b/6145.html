The old man was standing by the bookcase talking to a woman who seemed to be lost in some trance. The woman was tall and slender and had a lovely deep brown skin with deep brown eyes that shone with a beautiful brightness under her dark brown. She was wearing a black tuxedo shirt that was open to show a generous amount of cleavage, and matching black slacks that hugged her hips to perfection.</p> <p>She seemed to be talking at an unusually high pitch and had her eyes glued to the bookcase's front corner.</p> <p>After a moment the man looked over at her and asked her if she wanted a drink. He was obviously nervous or angry. He was probably in his late-thirties, and probably had to have done drugs to survive. The woman nodded and said, "The bartender will bring the bourbon."</p> <p>He turned and walked off in the direction of the bar. He stopped and turned around to look her again. She looked so beautiful that he really wanted to be her forever now. He couldn't resist a little playful push to her. With a big smile on his face, he said, "You look great, lady. I've heard I am very handsome."</p> <p>She smiled back then gave him a quick kiss on the cheek. "Well thank you, and I don't think you really wanted to come up here."</p> <p>"I was just about to leave. I am just looking for the books."</p> <p>"Why don't you look in the back room? That will give us some privacy."</p> <p>He hesitated for a moment then nodded. The bar door had been opened, and the dim glow of candle light from the entrance lit up the entire room. He was sure that it was a very nice place. The bar was quite dark, and there was a light at one end that gave a beautiful glow to the area. He could hear the sound of music which the walls hummed into place. The music was loud, romantic and seductive with just a touch of harshness of a southern accent. The lights of the room in the bar were bright and lit up the room with a light that illuminated it in such an intense way that he thought he may have been blinded. He glanced around for a moment to make sure there weren't any men.</p> <p>There were two other men in the bar, both of them in high-strung army jackets sitting at small tables. He made out a female woman sitting at a table near the back. Her husband was seated opposite a man sitting across from them. The man behind the waiter had his head back, and the man beside him was staring daggers at the man across the table. Another man behind them was sitting at the bar next to the woman sitting across the aisle. He was leaning back against the bar in his long leather jacket. The woman's eyes were focused on the two men opposite her. As they stared and looked away from her, she began to turn slowly and her breasts began to rise. She reached a hand into the front of her jacket and began caressing her breasts. It wasn't long before her breasts were swaying back and forth as her breasts grew. As her breasts had turned dark red, each breast appeared to be almost purple in color. The black silk blouse she was wearing was stretched tight across her stomach and her large breasts hung from it like mountains of creamy flesh.</p> <p>The man in front of them glanced up, and he too had one arm wrapped around the woman's slender waist. He was smiling down into her eyes with his deep brown eyes, the kind that had once held a faint smile, but would now be replaced by a smile with no sign of recognition. The man sitting opposite the woman on the bar was wearing a loose fitting shirt; he did not seem to be doing very much but staring at her with a mischievous grin on his face. That man in front of him also had on a pair of loose fitting black slacks but it wasn't loose at all; he was wearing a pair of short shorts. He was seated in a booth directly opposite one of the people that sat across from him; his hands were tucked into his lap and his arms folded behind his head as he watched the couple across the table. He appeared to be the epitome of a man that was about six foot seven inches tall, his blond hair was cut almost to his ears like a boy about to pass out, and he was dressed all in black. He was wearing a pair of tight fitting black pants that he did not seem to have a shirt buttoned much above his lap or his pants were cut a lot lower on his hips than his thighs. His shirt was unbuttoned just low enough that it just rested over one of his massive thick masts. He was smiling at the couple on the other side of the table and looked likeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
