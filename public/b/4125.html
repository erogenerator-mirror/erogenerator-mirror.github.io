"You're a mess, aren't you?"</p> <p>"So, you think I can get away with it with you?"</p> <p>"Oh no, I want you. And maybe I'll even let you go to town to take me back there."</p> <p>"How far do you want me to go? I get the car. I'm going back there, like, ten minutes to take a piss. Is that too much to ask for?"</p> <p>"So, it's about time you told me that story. I was beginning to worry about what you do with your time. You have never come back here with us."</p> <p>"I came back to pick up some more condoms. Why did you have to go back? Are you going to change your clothes when you get back here?"</p> <p>"I'm afraid so. You need to give me some time to think about all of that. And I am not telling you any more than I am already telling you."</p> <p>"I won't. I just have to let you off on your own merits to keep you with me."</p> <p>"Well, you can stop your car if you want to and I'll just have a quick word with Dave. Then we're on our way."</p> <p>~~~~~~</p> <p>We drove along the back roads. I talked to Dave for an hour and said little but a couple of my questions. He was still getting excited when I told him about the condom again. I knew if he ever suggested anyone ever again that he would say it again.</p> <p>As we were driving back, Dave said, "That little incident with the car you were telling him about yesterday was one of the worst I've ever had. I thought I would have a heart attack the minute I touched it. But, it seemed to get a whole lot easier because you were in on it, not just just that time."</p> <p>"I can tell you about that and I want to tell you more about it," I said. "The thing is, that little thing you did, you seem to get into the habit of getting condoms, and of me, and not just me."</p> <p>"That's not an uncommon occurrence. Dave, believe me, I was going to tell you about it. But, this is different. I don't want you to think I'm stupid. If I want to, I can just keep going out with you. You just go ahead and have fun. I told you I could get away with it and I will. I have done that, and you see why. Maybe you were curious in asking about the condom? I know I was. Maybe I would have gone in this direction. But, if I didn't have to worry about that sort of thing, I would have gone in the direction I wanted to go anyway."</p> <p>"Well, I was not going to make myself worry about that," he said with a laugh. "Now, I guess you're going to do something about what you don't even like about our arrangement."</p> <p>"Maybe it is best if you just go ahead and have a good time with me. That way you'll think I'm happy for the evening. That way we can always talk about you with no worries."</p> <p>"Yes, I like that. That is, until we get back to the house."</p> <p>"Well, just remember that one thing you've told me and I know it's going to be fun. You might need that wine, but I'm good to go."</p> <p>~~~~~~</p> <p>We got back to the house and I asked him where the bathroom was. He said that he had an old bathroom in there and that was where he wanted me to go. Dave, I can't believe I went there to tell him that. Where would that lead?</p> <p>"I had an idea," I told him. "I saw that little yellow box you brought back with you while I was in the neighborhood the other day. I can't believe if you did this, I'd think you were using that thing. You know, sometimes, just don't you see what's going on in you?"</p> <p>"Yeah," he told me. "That's it. That's how I got it. I've been practicing all over the house. Don't worry."</p> <p>"Okay, that's great! Just be careful there, right?"</p> <p>"I'm just a little nervous about this. I've never done anything like it before. It's a little scary, but, it's going to work out."</p> <p>"So, what'd you mean when you said that you've been practicing all over the house?"</p> <p>"Well, I just have to watch out for your sense of humor."</p> <p>"Well, why don't you find out how to do that too?"</p> <p>"Just go with the flow and teach meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
