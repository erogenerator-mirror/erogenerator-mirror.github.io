"I think we should have a talk."</p> <p>"Oh please, come in and have a seat. It is my pleasure." That is all I need, as I was about to go, the man returned and sat down on the bed beside him. He offered me a drink. I was still on my own.</p> <p>He got me another drink and placed it to my lips and set it down so I was quite capable of speaking. I finished one round as he offered the third and the final round to my lips before returning to the talking.</p> <p>He had not been sitting still as I expected, instead he was making eye contact, his hand had returned to his side, seemingly oblivious to my state of undress.</p> <p>In the next twenty seconds I began to lose the ability to speak. I could feel my inhibitions about evaporating, and the alcohol that was affecting me made me feel light hearted and very sexy.</p> <p>I heard myself saying "I love a good randy girl". I felt the first rush of warmth of desire, and felt the rush of something other than my husband's dick pressing against me. I felt a slight twitch and heard him say "Fuck off"</p> <p>Suddenly I sensed a presence. It was a young woman in her early twenties, about twenty-two with long dark hair. I felt the warm tingling that started to build under my tummy as she looked at me and smiled in appreciation.</p> <p>She had a slim frame, her breasts were large and firm with large nipples pointing a little down towards the ceiling. She was dressed in a thin, almost transparent cotton blouse that stopped just above her knees, which had no buttons on the front.</p> <p>'She is just so beautiful." I thought, and for the first time saw her clearly. "God, she is such a wonderful sight to see."</p> <p>"She certainly is," said the man who had spoken to me.</p> <p>"And her name is Kate." I heard the man's reply. "She is a bit older than you, but she looks younger, and younger that's why we are meeting here." "I'll enjoy your company, I'm Steve. I am married to her for forty-eight hours."</p> <p>I heard this as an invitation to join a few others for dinner.</p> <p>"Hello Steve." I said.</p> <p>"Kate, come up to my room." said Mr. Adams. "It is time for you to get ready for dinner."</p> <p>I had been getting more and more excited by the moment as he looked at me.</p> <p>"How will I do that?" I thought. "What if we make an extra effort? How about we have my undies all red, and your bra and top off for dinner?"</p> <p>And I was going to get them off for me too. But, there was more on my agenda tonight than waiting dinner and a little talk. I was looking forward to the night to come.</p> <p>He got up and left.</p> <p>I waited in the kitchen in my bedroom listening to the sounds of the people who were out there playing in the family room. I was glad that I was going to be alone. I don't know whether that was because I was turned on or whether it was because I wanted this new found freedom inside me.</p> <p>Then I heard the noise of a door being opened and a light, soft light came through. The light turned out to be my husband's bedroom as he came into the room.</p> <p>The man I had met at the market yesterday smiled at me as I approached him. I saw his head and the look of respect in his eyes. He wore a pair of boxers, which was a bit odd.</p> <p>"Hello, I am Steve Adams, Mrs. Maitland's husband, and I believe to be a little on the heavy side. I understand that the woman of your choice has asked for some time of your business here."</p> <p>I smiled at him, trying to be confident and not feel embarrassed about what I was about to do. "Well, come in."</p> <p>He said as he held out his hand to me. I felt he was very nice and courteous as he took his hand and helped me out of my clothes. The feeling of being naked in front of him was so erotic that I couldn't help but give in to it.</p> <p>He stood back and I felt his hands on either side of my shoulders forcing my body to stand in the air. He looked down at my body as he held me and then said, "Your husband is very impressive."</p> <p>He looked down at me as he reached up and put hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
