I replied, "This is great!"</p> <p>So I packed and went home. I spent nearly all of the evening watching television and masturbating. Not even thinking about doing it. The whole experience reminded me that this was a girl not my girlfriend, maybe we could go to another night when I had the chance.</p> <p>As I made my way to bed I started thinking about it. Had I ever been with anyone, or even in a relationship ever? The thoughts rushed over and over in my head, as I tried not to cum and get off. I thought I should have felt a little guilty for what I was doing when I had sex with my girlfriends, but if I did this, I could never have a man without feeling guilty, feeling like I had somehow betrayed them completely.</p> <p>I had just gotten home and started getting undressed. I put the clothes on the bed and lay down looking at myself in the mirror with my back to the bed. I decided to go to the bed with a pair of black underwear, no one could know, but I certainly hoped. Then I climbed into bed and put on the underwear; I then put on my white satin panties, with a matching bra. I put on the bra and slipped it on, then looked at myself and smiled.</p> <p>"This is nice!" I said, with a big smile.</p> <p>I got naked and went to the bathroom, then got into the shower. After getting in the shower, I stepped out of the bathroom drying myself, then grabbed my vibrator and started putting it and my pussy juices in my pussy, I looked at myself in the mirror. I felt so sexy, and it felt good to just do what I wanted to with myself. I pulled the covers off the bed, then reached into the night table and opened up my nightstand, then grabbed something.</p> <p>I went back into the bathroom and picked up the first vibrator I had ever seen, then got out of the shower and walked back into the bathroom. I picked up the first vibrator, it felt amazing to be in the room with the hot water, and I felt so sexy. I turned it on and let it run over and over my pussy. I started rubbing it on her clit and started to slide the buzzing vibrator into her pussy, watching the water run down and over her body making her wet. After a few moments, I pulled it out, then turned the vibrator over and slipped it inside her pussy, it slid in and out very slow, and she started pushing it in and out. I started feeling my clit and slid my vibrator all over it, I let out a moan as I felt myself getting close.</p> <p>I took the water from the shower, then stepped into the shower and grabbed a towel and put it on my body, then took the vibrator and started to run it over my nipples. With the hot water running over my tits, I turned the vibrator off so as to not go too fast, then I took it and put it between my soapy tits and started to rub it over, then down to my stomach and around my pussy. I stopped and grabbed the vibrator and put it directly on my clit. I began to go mad, going from one orgasm to another, feeling it and seeing it in my hand. After a few moments I could feel myself getting close as I started to get close too. I stopped myself as I looked in the mirror of the shower just to watch myself masturbate right there in front of the mirror.</p> <p>With the water flowing over my body it started to get a little bit more intense. I started to move it faster and faster, my tits were flying around wildly with each pulse, I was just about to cum and I turned it down on that high. Suddenly I felt the warmth in my pussy as I pushed the vibrator deep into me, and another loud moan escaped my lips as I had orgasm, the feelings had been just as intense and intense as the first time as I was in a bathroom full of people and couldn't believe it, my hand flew over my mouth and screamed a loud scream from ecstasy as the feelings hit me and I felt my whole body tensing up, almost having a seizure.</p> <p>As I came down from my orgasm, I continued to rub my breasts and pussy against the vibrator still inside me, as I leaned against the wall of the shower. It was getting hard not to cum as I had the vibrator still in that high position. I sat there for a moment just to catch my breath as I enjoyed just the sensations from it. Finally I opened my eyes to see that we had finally gotten to where we both wanted to go, she had gotten out and gone into the bathroom and I had gotten into another shower and on my hands and knees withâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
