John says a little sarcastically while looking at the calendar I showed him.</p> <p>"A really long one with the school board, and a lot of interesting people." I replied to John before getting a little smile. "But really, this is where I'm going." I said to John who looks almost as surprised as I do. I got up and grabbed the door to the reception where the board is and followed the board to a large table. As I sat down to get out of my uniform, I thought about what was happening with the school board and if I would get the girls to let me enter. I got a little smile as I looked at the board's name and realized that it was "Betsy."</p> <p>I look at the board looking back at me and see that it was in fact Betsy. I looked around.</p> <p>Betsy had arrived on Friday afternoon at my work and was now here with her husband and their kids. John had come from work on Friday as well and so were we all waiting for her to get out of town, so John and I could start on our projects.</p> <p>"Betsy, I am not sure if this is proper or proper," I said to John, "You do realize, if you go in there with her I will have to get myself caught looking at these." I said to John before grabbing him by the arm and walking him to a door at right angles from the office. After I got John out of his and the door, I grabbed a piece of paper and wrote on it, "Just call me anytime, okay?" Then I got up and walked back towards the door where my cell phone is.</p> <p>Betsy followed a moment after I got up and took her seat at the table. She looked at the paper I had written. My name is Betsy, this is Betsy! You're on!" she said to me as she looks up at me.</p> <p>The day is going to be great for me as it has to be just as I tell you. The girls are going to really like having sex with youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
