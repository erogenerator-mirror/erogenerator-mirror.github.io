She was naked except for her shoes.</p> <p>"So..." she said with a smile, "I see you like what you see: are you ready or not?"</p> <p>I tried to answer my mother, but I couldn't speak, and I was suddenly afraid that I would cry if I didn't. I desperately felt my cock jerking up in sympathy from my humiliation, and I could feel my balls tightening up for release.</p> <p>She put the toilet seat down and looked at me. "Just in time: I need to wash my hands. I just want to have a drink. I think I need to wipe the soap off of my hands." With that she put a huge mug of cold milk in front of me and then sat down onto the toilet in front of me.</p> <p>She smiled broadly and raised her eyebrows. "Good. I had better see if you are up to it..." With that she gave her hand signal and I saw my mother put the cold water mug down on the toilet seat behind me and then I felt the coldness of the piss in the piss-hole. She looked at me, and then let the water fill the cup in front of me.</p> <p>"What do you want?" she asked. I saw my mother reach for something in the toilet bowl and a sudden burst of bubbles shot up in the bowl. It was warm and the warm water felt good against my body.</p> <p>"It's... It's so hot in there..." I mused.</p> <p>"No you idiot. Let's take a sip of this." She turned the water into a frothy foam and said, "Just sip it in a cup."</p> <p>I wanted to cry again but I couldn't say anything. I reached out to her but she pulled her robe tightly closed and gave me another shove so I sank my hand into the cup and drank the cold water.</p> <p>"Do not touch it! You are filthy! You used to love it!"</p> <p>After the water had been emptied, I handed my mother the empty cup and she sat back on the toilet with a smile and sat her cup down.</p> <p>"You have to do a lot more than this: take the piss. Drink it."</p> <p>She had the grace to say: "I will if you will."</p> <p>I saw my mom raise her voice and say "No! You will not! I can't go like this... please, come on!"</p> <p>I was dumbstruck. "But... I don't know how!" I said and then went back to my knees.</p> <p>"Come on!" she said.</p> <p>"But I don't know what." I pleaded as her robe flapped open. "What do I have to do?"</p> <p>"There is your solution. You tell me that you don't have anyone to share the tub."</p> <p>There was a silence but then she said, "Your father is out this week with his work. I won't stay till Saturday tomorrow, you know. Don't go up with your friends, please."</p> <p>"But my parents, I don't have anyone... "</p> <p>"Don't worry. You'll find the bathtub a little cleaner after they sleep through the evening. Take your bath with me: we won't take our food. We will share... you'll feel... happy... I mean the warm water. It's nice and cold in there."</p> <p>She laughed. "We'll be right back then," she said. Then she stood up, turned the bath water off and let me lean over the toilet seat. I felt the toilet seat and the cold water, and I could see my mother's tits and her belly.</p> <p>"You know how you look..." she started to say, but ended up saying: "I can take this..." Then she got a pillow and put it on the seat of the toilet. I was surprised, she was really taking it.</p> <p>"I don't care if you feel embarrassed," she continued. "Just do it. "</p> <p>"But... I don't know...."</p> <p>"Just put your head on it!" she said.</p> <p>I did what she asked. The feeling of warm water caressing my back and I was feeling something else. Then I lifted my head and let her pour the water down my back and into the toilet. Her fingers felt good and I felt better too. She did it with soap and that made me feel a lot more of a woman.</p> <p>"You will feel much better now," she said, smiling widely. "You should wash your hair."</p> <p>"No..." I said and began to rub the soap on my back, "I can't... I can'tâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
