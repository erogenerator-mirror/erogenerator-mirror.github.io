He said, his heart beating against his chest. He took the glass from her hand and looked down on her beautiful face, her sparkling green eyes looking up into his. He loved her, but that wasn't true.</p> <p>"Thanks," he said softly, "I don't know what I'm going to say though" "It's ok" she smiled, "I really enjoyed having you here and all". He smiled back and took a sip of wine. He watched as she took a sip, just like he had done for her. She looked back up. The smile he had on his face told her he was enjoying the view as well. She leaned forward and grabbed the back of his neck, planting a hot kiss on his lips. He kissed back and his hands slid up her back to her perfect B cup breasts. He squeezed them through their fabric tight bodysuit. He leaned forward against her and began to kiss her neck. She leaned back into him; her arms slipped around him and her breasts spilled into his. He began to kiss her neck again and she pulled her head away from his and looked down at him with those amazing blue irises.</p> <p>"I'm glad you enjoyed my trip, now let's do something else".</p> <p>He smiled and smiled back at her and he leaned in, kissing her again, she responded by opening her mouth to him. He pulled her into him tightly, his arms wrapped around her, and ran his fingers across her body. He had a perfect view of her body, he could see the curve of her back through her dress. He kissed her stomach as he reached into her neck and tugged at the top button of her top. She pulled her top off her shoulders but continued to hold him and continued to kiss him. He pulled the collar from her neck, letting her have a chance to put it back on her. The neck of her top fell open and he saw every square inch of her heaving breasts. She reached behind her back and undid her blouse buttons one by one sending them to the floor. She leaned back against the bed her breasts thrust out, his eyes never leaving them. Her breasts swayed when she moved. He leaned down to kiss them again, taking each nipple into his mouth with his tongue. He pulled back, looking down at her, her eyes locked onto his. He took the top of her bra and slowly slipped it from her. She took it from him and tossed it aside. "Wow" he said staring, "I can honestly say this top fits you perfectly." He smiled at her chest and let his hands brush lightly over her hard nipples. He kissed her again, slowly. He took his thumb and forefinger and rolled them around the center of her breasts, watching as they filled his hands. He moved his mouth away and looked deeply into her eyes with a lust filled look. He leaned down and took first one nipple, then the other into his mouth. Her moans of pleasure were loud in the room. He kissed her neck again while still holding her breast in his hand. He pulled her towards him to him. He began to kiss her neck again. He pushed her shirt up and bit her neck. He began kissing her neck and he bit her collar bone. She moaned loudly against his mouth and slid her hand down to his shorts. He didn't even hesitate, pulling them down to expose his penis. He took her hand in his and brought it to his mouth, licking all around it in a circular motion, slowly working his hand up and down his shaft.</p> <p>She continued to lick from his ear down to his chest. He slid his hand down, between her breasts and back to her nipples. They were stiffly erect and he began to tug them softly. She pulled back, a look of shock on her face.</p> <p>"I can't". she said softly.</p> <p>"I could if you asked me" he replied.</p> <p>He felt her body tense against him. He smiled to himself knowing just how much she would want thisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
