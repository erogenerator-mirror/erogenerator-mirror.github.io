He loved and respected her, even if their relationship was weird but even if it was he wanted to find out what this was.</p> <p>"Dan?" she said. "Are you married?"</p> <p>"I am."</p> <p>"And your wife?"</p> <p>"Yes." he said.</p> <p>"Do you want more?"</p> <p>"More." he said softly.</p> <p>Linda nodded. They had worked for a while for this to happen. With her life outside and her husband's relationship she was doing okay. He found out just how different it was with her life outside.

He pulled at the small bow at her neck letting it free. He slid his hands down the back of her shoulder blades and across to her waist as Linda pulled on the waist material. She pulled it off with quick motions. He was wearing what she had on today. It fell gracefully to the floor to reveal a lace bra. He looked down and it was too tiny, just enough for him to be able to fit his arms into her bra comfortably.</p> <p>"You're wearing lace?" he said, his voice hoarse like he was being choked.</p> <p>"Yes."
