"I'm not convinced," she said.</p> <p>"If I was still human, you wouldn't be running," I said, but I also made my point. It didn't seem like the best strategy right now.</p> <p>"How far are we to go?" she asked.</p> <p>"There's no other way," I answered as I reached around her and put my left hand around her stomach.</p> <p>"I'm still too scared to move," she sobbed, her body trembling. I had never really felt that scared before in my life. It was different than having a stranger inside of me, it was as if my control was gone.</p> <p>"I'm sorry."</p> <p>"Don't apologize," she said.</p> <p>I leaned over and kissed her. This was it. There were no more boundaries, only rules. The first time would be the hardest. We had to stay at her apartment. We had to have each other's back.</p> <p>I don't know if it was her fear or mine, but I wasn't prepared for where that led. Our first time, together, had been terrifying, and when we had taken our clothes off, there had really been no going back. That had happened, and we were going to do it again. And again. And often.</p> <p>I could tell something was wrong when we kissed, but I didn't really care about anything. If I had something on my mind, I would have just gone ahead and had the rest of the weekend. I'd never felt like that. No one wanted to be with a woman, even when they wanted to be. We had different styles of sex. I wondered if it was too fast because she just liked me and didn't want to start all over again. So I went down on her.</p> <p>When I kissed my partner, her body shuddered. I ran a hand down over her belly button, to her pussy. I gently inserted two fingers into her. Her body began to tense when I touched her clitoris, and I put my other arm up around her stomach.</p> <p>When I felt her body begin to shake, I looked up at her and licked my way up her neck to her earlobe. "You are so beautiful," I said. I put my lips over all her earlobes, sucking lightly, kissing my way down to her neck. I sucked gently and brought her up to my face, kissing her as I did so. Her arms went around my back, and she pressed her body against me.</p> <p>It didn't take long for both of our bodies to begin to quiver. Our mutual pleasure caused our bodies to shake as I came closer to my goal: fucking her in the dark.</p> <p>"Your boyfriend isn't here," she said. There was a tear on her left eye, but there was also the glow of arousal. I could feel the warm juices around my dick. I began to slide my penis in and out of her body. Slowly, I tried to make the most of my chance at her.</p> <p>I knew what she wanted, but I wasn't sure she wanted me to stop. We could both tell she felt the same way. I could tell that the other didn't want to feel the same way.</p> <p>I tried to think of something; anything to stop myself from losing it, but my body was getting weaker. I couldn't tell if she was enjoying my technique or not. My body was trying to break apart with the speed she had set.</p> <p>"No, not now," she answered, "I don't want him to get away from me."</p> <p>"You don't want him to get away?" She sounded angry.</p> <p>"I think he might be a little angry with you," I replied. "Maybe he is going to try it once."</p> <p>"No, he won't. Maybe he likes sex with a girl. Maybe he is going to play with her for a while. Whatever it is, it's something."</p> <p>She didn't say anything. I kept sliding my cock in and out of her. It wasn't until the moment I came, when the thought of having someone else in my body made me lose it. The feeling of it gave me hope that the other was getting close.</p> <p>"I think he will be mad," she said, "he will really hate all this."</p> <p>"Not this. That will end our relationship. And we can't do any more." We both reached around her and began rubbing her clitoris again and in a similar rhythm. When she came, I felt my penis swell as her body shook. It was only a few seconds before she tensed and I felt her juices wetting my bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
