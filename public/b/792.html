As he held her tight, she closed her eyes and groaned as she felt him inside her and he gave her ass a slight squeeze and she moaned louder, her pussy pulsating around him, her legs straining against the couch.</p> <p>Kris closed her eyes a moment longer and felt his body tremble, before he pulled it out of her slightly and stood up abruptly and quickly took over, walking her upstairs.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>That night.</p> <p>When they got back, she felt so empty and she was glad she wasn't going to sleep in.</p> <p>"Do you want to have it?" she whispered, staring up at him curiously as she slid her panties down and off, exposing a patch of pale, tanned skin.</p> <p>"I-I, um, I thought you wanted my cherry." Jason stammered.</p> <p>"Is that why you're not allowed to cum?" she asked, leaning over and slowly kissing his chest before sucking his nipples into her mouth. "So you have something to do, don't you?"</p> <p>"Yes," he whispered as she kissed his hips and legs, licking his cock lightly before wrapping her mouth around it and sliding it up and down, sucking it while her hand stroked him up and down on the way up. Jason sighed and looked down at her, and saw that she was watching him with a smile. "What?"</p> <p>"I want you to eat my pussy," she said, licking her lips as her eyes stayed locked on him as he slowly walked towards the couch and then sat down, pulling her into his lap. Jason gasped as she wrapped her arms around his neck and her legs around his waist, straddling him, making herself impossibly tight. She moaned against his lips as he slid his hands up her thighs and caressed her calves, then moved her hands back up and slid them down his chest.</p> <p>"Jason," she breathed into his ear as she sat down on him again, sitting down hard. "You don't have to. I want you. All we have is this. Just this, Jason." She wrapped her arms around each side of him, making him groan as he felt her soft breasts press against his chest.</p> <p>"Then I need you," he groaned, his cock throbbing painfully through his pants and into her. "So badly."</p> <p>"Jason, please," she moaned against his lips as he slowly rubbed her clit with his thumb and began to kiss and lick her lower lip. She lifted his chin to bring his lips to hers and kissed him back, her body quivering as the kiss heated her up, her desire taking over her body.</p> <p>Jason smiled, running his hand through her hair as she rocked her hips back and forth against him. He slid his hand down her body, feeling her legs and then her back as he started to feel her hot pussy, glistening with her excitement, the pink hole glinting in the light as it pulsed and clenched his fingers. His hips rose, sliding his cock up inside her, feeling the wet heat of her and the heat and soft flesh, as he reached around her hips, feeling how tight she was, how eager she was for him to be inside her. He kissed her lips, her neck as he moved slowly in and out of her, taking his pleasure from within her. She moaned in his ear, tightening against him as he moved faster inside her, the need inside her mounting, her moans getting louder with every thrust until she screamed as she came, her fingernails digging into his back in intense pleasure. After she stopped shaking and breathless, Jason lifted his face from hers and kissed her softly, running his hands up her waist and over her breasts, squeezing them until she whimpered.</p> <p>"I'm not finished tonight with you," he whispered, kissing her cheek before turning his hips and slowly withdrawing it again, making her gasp as she felt his head reenter her, slowly filling her, making her feel as empty as a child.</p> <p>After a second of pause, he pushed in again and began to move in and out of her slowly, sliding her in and out of her. It was the most intense, pleasurable feeling he had ever felt, and he knew he could stay there a little longer if he wanted; but once she finally came down, he couldn't stop, he had to feel them both again. Jason slowly moved his hips, rubbing her up through her and over her breasts, his mouth following, sucking her nipples, and licking them.
