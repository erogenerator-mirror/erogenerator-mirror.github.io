This was turning into a discussion.</p> <p>"When's your last chance?"</p> <p>"Next time," I said.</p> <p>"Next?"</p> <p>"Next time......" I could tell that this was turning into a discussion about how I hadn't thought of what could happen after Mike left.</p> <p>"Next time," she said. I waited for her to respond to my next suggestion.</p> <p>"Next time........," she paused, then continued. "We could try that again. Maybe do it more often, if you feel the same way, then do that again...."</p> <p>We both laughed. I had to put on a front because of my wife.</p> <p>"That's how I feel, every day now. I think the idea will get me excited. I'll think about it more. Why don't you go and see Mike tomorrow morning and we'll see what happens."</p> <p>I wondered for a little while if I should say something or do just walk away. Mike and I were in love. We'd always been on the same page. Then I thought about it, if only for a minute, then I would probably do it. We'd always know what to do.</p> <p>With that thought in my mind I left Michelle alone. I went to Mike's room and knocked on the door.</p> <p>"Yes?" the man said, his voice was even with mine.</p> <p>"It's on...."</p> <p>"It's late.....I thought I'd come and......"</p> <p>"No.... I've got to know everything then," he began.</p> <p>He started by telling me how we had met. He'd been the one to offer me the job. I had given him an estimate and thought for a moment that I'd sell his company to him, but he'd said he'd hold on to a larger deal rather than pay me to be involved. After what I had done to him, he hadn't even asked what had to be done. I had to believe him.</p> <p>"What was it like?"</p> <p>"It wasn't like mine at all. I have a little bit of a thing for older people...."</p> <p>"Are you serious?"</p> <p>"Maybe. It took me a bit to get the job. I'm sorry for you, but if I got it my way, I'd get it very early.</p> <p>A few weeks later I had another job in South Central. When I told Mike what I wanted, he gave me his advice. We had talked about the possibilities of this business and he felt it would be good for both.</p> <p>"There was just one more thing........ I've got to know everything, in detail for the record....."</p> <p>"How?" Mike asked.</p> <p>"I don't have to tell you how it happened here...."</p> <p>He laughed.</p> <p>"No. No, no..... You're not to blame here. I can see that you and I are already on to something."</p> <p>"I don't know what to do with Mike. I had a bad feeling about him..... I thought he was like me..... I mean........ We were very close..... Well, maybe not as close as I was before........"</p> <p>"Well, go and have a nice time."</p> <p>I thought that this was the best thing I had come across. I was just about to leave, when Mike called me and said he was coming back and I'd better stay.</p> <p>After Mike walked away, I decided to follow him home. This time, I really did enjoy the time we had together and I would do it again. I just didn't know how Mike would feel. I knew that things weren't going to work out between us, but I decided to see what happened.</p> <p>Mike's house was big and he was the first one in about ten minutes when he saw me coming out of the house. Mike came to me immediately and embraced me.</p> <p>"I couldn't go into this without you," I said.</p> <p>"Well, you know what to do. It was okay, wasn't it?"</p> <p>"Of course," I said, relieved that I hadn't gotten his answer. So I walked down the street to his house and rang the doorbell. I waited outside for Mike and after a bit, he opened the door and stepped inside.</p> <p>"Let me see your coat," he said, taking my coat off, leaving my shirt and pants. "Oh, my husband said to keep it in the house. That's okay."</p> <p>"Why, how did it go?" I asked, not waiting for Mike's answer.</p> <p>"Well, I saw that you had your eye on him aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
