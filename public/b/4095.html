I slipped an arm around her back and then reached up and cupped her ass in my hand. She turned, and kissed me. I broke the kiss and said, "I don't want to come back, but I've got no other place I'd rather be than right in your arms."</p> <p>I started to pull the bra off but she stopped me.</p> <p>"No, no, no," she said. "I want your cock. I want you to fill me. I want you to get hard again." I said, laughing, and then stripped.</p> <p>She stood up, and we kissed again. I slipped my hands under her skirt and squeezed tight her ass. We broke the kiss, and she said, "You better go out and get me a pillow, because I'm not going to be easy on you tonight. You better make a good impression on those friends after this." I kissed her, and followed her out to the living room.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>My cock was standing at attention, and Jenny pulled her skirt over it, revealing her panties.</p> <p>Jenny said, "I want to suck your cock for a little bit." She slipped a knee between my legs and straddled me, sliding down over my cock with her feet. I raised my hips and she lowered herself on me, and began to slide up and down as she sucked. Each time she rose up, I slid a finger through her bush and touched her clit.</p> <p>I said, "Is this good?" She nodded.</p> <p>"Mmm, very good," she cooed, "and you better keep that up."</p> <p>Jenny raised herself up, and began to kiss me again. "I don't want to wait long," she said, and began to kiss her way down my chest and stomach. Her mouth was wet, and her breasts were soft. She leaned down and took one in her mouth. She started to kiss the top of her stomach, and then went lower. I raised one leg and she moved it back so that her pussy would enter my cock easily.</p> <p>Jenny moved down, kissing her way to rest on my cock, but taking it slowly down to her wet opening, kissing her way up to the tip, sucking it into her throat.</p> <p>I lifted my hips and held Jenny in place. She held my cock with one hand as she lowered her head, and took several inches of me inside her mouth.</p> <p>I said, "Oh God, Jenny. I can't believe this is the best blow job I've ever had!"</p> <p>Jenny looked up at me and said, "It's been so long. I don't ever want this thing to stop. This was just so good."</p> <p>Jenny began to move up and down on me, taking it up and down, and up and down. I put my hands on her ass and thrust my hips up to meet her each time she rose up, as long as I could keep control. We kissed as hard and as long as we could, as deep as we could, enjoying the sensation of our bodies joining. I felt her hand reach up towards my mouth and she turned it over in mine. She kissed and bit my lips, as she began to move up and down faster and faster. Her body moved faster and faster, as she moaned loudly around my cock.</p> <p>I was beginning to lose control now.</p> <p>"Oh Jenny. I'm going to come, Jenny. I'm going to come!"</p> <p>She didn't stop until she felt the tension rising again, and then she took over, beginning to suck me in earnest until her body was wracked once more with pleasure, and the flood of sensation rushed deep from her pussy. We collapsed in a heap on the couch, and I lifted my head and she said, "Damn, that was incredible."</p> <p>"You are something," I said, and she kissed me on the lips.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>The two of us looked at each other, smiled, and kissed. We finished our drinks, and then we walked hand in hand to the bedroom. I lay on the bed, and she quickly fell asleep, her head near my shoulder. She had the most beautiful breasts, and the nipples were so hard. I could easily have just kissed them, but I pulled them away from her body and held them in my hand.</p> <p>Jenny opened her eyes when I kissed her, a smile that said, "I don't want you to do anything you think I'm ready too."</p> <p>I had the feeling I needed to take care of things after what was just that evening. I pulled her up on the bed, and then took the pillow and blanket and covered us in them. I lay back, facing her, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
