You have been wonderful, both to yourself and to me. I love you... and I do love you to. I'm happy in your eyes. The best, most wonderful friend you've ever had, Sir. You are now mine, forever.</p> <p>-I'm glad. I just hope you enjoy it as much as we will. It's going to be so good for me!</p> <p>-It is, Sir, if it was only for a little longer.</p> <p>-Just a little longer, yes. A little longer, I'll never leave you again!</p> <p>-And I did enjoy that!</p> <p>He did, too, once more, when he was in the midst of climaxing and he kissed her passionately and said:</p> <p>-Please be a good boy, then! I'm going to come when it happens! Come, my dear, come, my darling, come!</p> <p>She reached out with her hands to grasp him and he felt the spasms of her vaginal contractions as the orgasm overtook her as he climaxed and felt the spasms begin anew as he climaxed himself. She was breathing rapidly and sighing as her climax subsided and the flow of love-juices diminished, and it was still there, though the contractions did remain. It had been a long, passionate, joyous time. He kissed her forehead and said:</p> <p>-Let's go to bed. I'll be a good boy now, as we'll be here!</p> <p>We were ready for bed, so they stood together as he opened the door and, just as she had done, she slid into bed, kissed him and said:</p> <p>-Can you go soon? In bed?</p> <p>-Of course.</p> <p>-Let's do it again in the morning! Oh!</p> <p>He laughed and said:</p> <p>-Of course, Sir!</p> <p>-I know. Now, what can I take you?</p> <p>-I'll carry on what my darling used to do, until we're ready for the next step. I'm yours, whatever you want -- you can have it, whatever you want, if you can do it as well as I can, just so long as you do it as well as I can.</p> <p>She didn't stop him or resist further suggestion:</p> <p>-I want it, too! I want all of it, Sir. Do you want to come again?</p> <p>-Can you do that -- again, anyway?</p> <p>-Of course, Darling! I'm all yours.</p> <p>-Come, Lover! Come, now! Come, Lover!</p> <p>He went to the bathroom, filled a water jug and, having taken the first dose of it, washed his face, rinsed the cloth in it and said:</p> <p>-Go now, then!</p> <p>She was already in the bed, naked except for the tiny bra and thong which she hadn't put on when she was in the bathroom. He came to her and, in the same moment, his cock was hard again as he had only done that time. She looked up at him and said:</p> <p>-You go, Lover, please come with me!</p> <p></p> <p>Part Three: The First Morning Together</p> <p>He took off his clothes after she had been naked but she took off her undies. She then led him to the bathroom and they sat on the bathtub. He had taken off her bra first, exposing her breasts to the light; his hand had only just touched her pussy and she asked:</p> <p>-Do you like my breasts.</p> <p>-Yes, they are beautiful, Sir. Have you ever seen them before?</p> <p>-No, Sir! They've been quite a bit of work for you already.</p> <p>-Just a little. Tell me about them.</p> <p>He told her about the two of them having an affair for two and a half years -- and it was all about that.</p> <p>-You're very good, Sir, Sir, for a young man. If you don't want to go any further, say so in front of me.</p> <p>-Oh please, Sir. This feels so deliciously naughty!</p> <p>-Would it be a better time to do this, Sir? I still need to have an open relationship with you -- I have had several men tell me to be with him, of course. Tell me about their relationship and so on.</p> <p>-Just go to it anyway. It's all rather simple. I need to know everything right now, and it won't make much difference whether you want to or not. They can always say that they were interested in me, no, I already am.</p> <p>She opened the bath door and he had a look at the water around her naked body:</p> <p>-I'm happy that you have such a nice figure for me, Sirâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
