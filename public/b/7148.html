No, she didn't say anything at all. She just laughed.</p> <p>"Dude," I said, "what the hell is a man to do in this place and you guys don't even have to ask."</p> <p>The three of us laughed. The music stopped and the lights dimmed.</p> <p>"We're home, ladies," Dave said. After a minute, Amy looked over at Eric and said, "Let's go," and we quickly followed her to her bedroom.</p> <p>It was huge. A queen size bed, dresser. There were mirrors on the wall and an old stereo system. The only one open in the room was a huge closet, with doors running all the way down to it. Dave and Eric led us to the bedroom.</p> <p>Amy locked her bedroom door, and we took our clothes off and threw them on the bed. We grabbed each other and started kissing again. I couldn't quite believe how turned-on I was.</p> <p>Soon our hands were all over each others bodies. We had our turn again in the mirror. Eric had his hands around my neck pulling me to him and all of a sudden he was on his knees on the bed with me.</p> <p>"Wait a sec," he said. He got off the bed and pulled me down on my back and he started kissing my body all over, starting with the shoulders.</p> <p>Amy came into the room wearing her dress, but not the thong, which seemed to be just as wet as mine. She started pulling my pants down slowly, and it was almost at the bottom she started to unbuckle them and, after getting them down to my feet, I helped.</p> <p>"Now this is fun." A moment later she had my pants and underwear off and on the floor. Dave pulled up to the bathroom next to the bed.</p> <p>By this time I was pretty damn horny.</p> <p>"You said you wanted to stay," I said, "you were in need of a fix right now."</p> <p>"I've had everything I need in those last few hours," Amy said, sitting on the bed next to me. "I think there's a few things I need you to do." Amy got on all fours, facing the mirror. She grabbed the dildo from her night stand, and spread herself wide.</p> <p>She started teasing her clit with the vibe that was already buried deep inside her. She had an orgasm just a split second after I was licking her clit. I had never gotten a blowjob before, and I was surprised that even in our experience, some of my own was a bit of a turn-on. I knelt in front of her, and she slid the vibe into herself.</p> <p>"Mmmmmmmm" Amy said. "This is so good."</p> <p>I crawled up behind her. I had an immediate hard on. As I started to insert the vibe into her, I heard Eric call my name, "Dude!", and I turned around and heard Amy say, "That's Eric."</p> <p>I took care of her, sliding into her again, just as she had requested, and continued to play her vibrator as she came, just as I had fantasized many nights to.</p> <p>After she came, we pulled off the bed.</p> <p>"That was the ultimate fuck-up the right way," Amy said. I could tell that Eric had a very strange look in his eyes, as though he was a witness to a major miracle happen. Eric looked confused, but he got over it, and pulled Amy to him. There we kissed deeply, sharing tongues. A moment later, Amy's vibrator started to buzz softly, and I came quickly and hard.</p> <p>After we came, we took the vibe out of Eric's hand, and we put it on the dresser. I was still recovering from the experience, and it took less than a minute to realize that her vibrator had started buzzing. I tried to push the vibe into her body, but she turned it off quickly. I grabbed the vibrator, but Amy stopped me.</p> <p>"It's okay. I'll go get the rest of the things from her dresser," she said.</p> <p>I lay back on the bed, trying to catch my breath. I glanced at the clock. It was almost time for dinner.</p> <p>Amy started to leave the room, and got dressed.</p> <p>"I'm going," she said. She got dressed, went over to me, and gave me a warm, lingering kiss. This time she whispered to me, "You are so fucking good."</p> <p>My head was swimming.</p> <p>She walked over and gently caressed myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
