Its the least I can do for those poor girls when they wear those things so I have to be nice to them," I complained, and then I looked again at her pretty face.</p> <p>"I know, but your mom does so much for me and me in this world. I've got to get these things," she said. The girls walked toward me while mom started to make quick sales, and then she stopped to look at things on the front. "We can't go into here with these just because we haven't given them what they want," she said.</p> <p>"But why? What are we going to wear?" I asked.</p> <p>"Don't worry; we've a lot of things in the can. It's not that big a deal. Just wear what you like and you have my number handy."</p> <p>So much for that. She got up and picked up the shoes. I didn't even feel them, for a change. My toes were still sore. She put them on and helped me pick them out and my ankle and foot felt like a baseball bat. She looked over at the sales assistant and told her to get this woman some plastic bag. I was in shock. This was worse than when I lost my leg. A young man in his late twenties was carrying out the sales register and I wasn't sure what I should do but my legs started to move and I had butterflies in my stomach.</p> <p>The sales girl was a middle aged man with a short, thin, grey hair and a beard. She had blue eyes and wore glasses. She looked around in the cart and then walked over to me without saying anything. "Hey, Miss B, you need new shoes. How can I fix you back there?"</p> <p>My brain was back as though it were an old one. I felt like I was looking at old magazines. My feet were moving so fast I was having trouble getting up. "Where am I supposed to look?" I finally managed, not sure what to say, but my words came out as a whisper.</p> <p>"You're just going to wear these shoes because you don't think they suit you," the sales girl said. She took my right foot and began to rub it in the toe. "This is kind of a strange experience," she said. "These feet are so soft. It's hard to walk normally like that. You can have this right here but in here with these things on, especially for the mall."</p> <p>"Oh, no. You could have my mom," I said.</p> <p>"Don't you worry about her, I'm sure she loves these shoes. We all wear them more than once a month to start with. She will love them. Go on, try them on and see if you like them. It won't hurt," the sales girl said.</p> <p>I walked around the shoes in my size and looked at them while they had this new polished toes. That looked a little better, but not much. They were in a high heel style that really showed off the heel. The salesman had picked out the straps and I noticed some black heels had fallen off.</p> <p>"I like these. They're great. It's no wonder your father wants you to wear them."</p> <p>My head was spinning, and I could hardly focus on anything at all. My feet moved so fast.</p> <p>"Come on," the sales girl said. "We'll just try these on and see. Here, wear this shoe while I get your bag here."</p> <p>The shoes didn't feel as good as she had described them, but it was better. These looked like real shoes. I was more relaxed so I tried each pair. They were perfect and my feet looked great. In no time or after my toes got tired and I started to feel sleepy again. That meant a lot to me, and I started to shake a little. But I was still feeling happy that they seemed happy.</p> <p>When I went outside I found the store to my right and noticed a sign for the mall. There is a lot of stores around this mall. There seemed to be too many to choose from. What the hell, I thought. I found a nice long term store where I could pick up the right pair of shoes and then go somewhere else without feeling bored. There had to be two hours and I would have done that. Then the clerk came in the front and I took off the heels.</p> <p>"Okay, I'm sorry but there isn't time to stock up before you go back home. Now where are you going?" the clerk asked.</p> <p>I told she had to take them with me to the counter and explained the shoe straps to her. I saw her face go red when she saw the shoes and I felt sorry for herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
