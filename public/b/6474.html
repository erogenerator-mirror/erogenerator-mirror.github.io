The next day we took a day class. My tutor gave us English together but she was very professional but had no idea how to improve.</p> <p>The day we went back to the office again she said that I was not a good enough English student so she would give me a hand of hers. So the following day we tried it all the time, we studied in class and then came back to the office. We had another lesson the next day, she asked me what I wanted to be able to do.</p> <p>I said that I was ready to write but that I had not thought of having you for about five years.</p> <p>I was thinking that maybe I could write more stories as I did.</p> <p>The next day I wrote this chapter of my life. The subject was different. It was my wife, being used as an object and not having any way to get it back. I wrote about her making love to me in a different way than in other stories.</p> <p>She seemed delighted when she read the story. "Was it not you that you used, that I had written as well?</p> <p>I wrote back, "I did not even want to think of it, so it was you."</p> <p>"How can I ever use that to please the people I love?" she asked.</p> <p>"But, that was part of the game, I thought you were cheating at work."</p> <p>"How could this be cheating?"</p> <p>"It was me, cheating was me and you."</p> <p>"And, how would you explain this to me?" she asked.</p> <p>The first thing I said after we read is that I would keep a journal of the whole story so that we could write it.</p> <p>"Can you please do that and explain the way we use and abuse each other?"</p> <p>"Is this something you want to happen in real life?"</p> <p>"What if this is not that part of the game."</p> <p>"Let's see, yes or no, this is real and yes," she said.</p> <p>"And, if it is not in real life that part of the game is also real?"</p> <p>"It is real and not something we were doing, not anything else we used to do, not even to you. We have agreed to be friends and we will keep it a little secret between us but not until the time we are married and have a baby. I don't want this to take a chance on not having much to do with you if we are to be friends again.</p> <p>"But, do you also want to be a sub?"</p> <p>"Yes, I will not be able to live without you." And she said, "I love you with all my heart."</p> <p>"So, it doesn't really have to be in our life together? I can just read it and do it, I can take it any day. It has only just gotten around to me. If I do want to keep it a secret I can just do this."</p> <p>I put my arms around my wife and held her close. We kissed and cuddled for several minutes. Then I said, "So, we are even. I love you. What more do you need to know?"</p> <p>"I love you too, honey, I have to have that too."</p> <p>She put her hand on my breast and said, "Yes, that is a good question. I can think of something else though, if it is not that. Let's go and get cleaned up; it is late and you need to get home."</p> <p>She was looking into my eyes and I could read that she wanted more. I was thinking to myself that she may have told me already how she felt about me because of my being a Dom/sub.</p> <p>Chapter 24</p> <p>I said to her that I wanted her to be available the next day; that Monday the following morning, I told her to meet me at our lunch place, take a shower and change into something sexy and sexy and I would call later in order that I could be with her the next day.</p> <p>And, when we got to our place I told her that she had already learned everything she needed to know. That she would be my sub today and if that is OK.</p> <p>Chapter 30</p> <p>I wanted that to be my secret to never mention to anybody but my wife. I knew that if I told a friend that she never told anyone else.</p> <p>I got her to change into something that showed off her long legs, a lot of skin and even more because her legs were so long that they didn't bend when she took them off. I had already decided that I liked her that much. She told me that I still have an idea about what I need to do, but if everything she wanted I could do the same thingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
