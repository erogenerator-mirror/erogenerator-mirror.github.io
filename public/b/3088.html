This is so wrong and so wonderful. It's the best thing that has ever happened to me, is happening to me. And for all the reasons on the previous chapter, this is just too good to be true. This is my first story ever. Comments are encouraged.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>I wake up with my cock still in my hand as my arm starts to get some life back. I groggily look around. The room is dark and I can hear the shower running. I look out the window and notice a slight breeze from the east which seems warmer but also much warmer.</p> <p>I'm not really sure.</p> <p>I'm on my side facing the window. It feels so weird that I can still feel the sun burning my skin. I feel that I'm in my bed with my arm draped across a pillow and my arm over the back of the pillow.</p> <p>Oh God.</p> <p>I'm still in a trance as if I'm trying to get to sleep but I'm not sure.</p> <p>As I turn my head to the side and turn my palm over to the side of my face I can see my hand being uncovered. My eyes slowly open, and they're staring at the ceiling. "Is this where its going to end?" I think to myself.</p> <p>With a start I realize that I'll have to look down to see. "Wha... What the hell?" I say out loud.</p> <p>"Fuck!" A loud moan escapes my mouth, "Fuck fuck fuck FUCK OH GOD" is my next thought and the moan sounds like a long string of words trying to get out.</p> <p>And the moan sounds a lot like when I was dreaming about someone or something being in my dream. It's so intense that it's so real.</p> <p>I just remember the night a lot earlier and remembering it. All of that time and the thought of everything, everything, everything, fucking my sister. The thought makes me feel really horny.</p> <p>It's like I couldn't remember anything like that. I'm a virgin and yet I wanted to be with this person and now I've never been with another girl. It's crazy but it seems so right. I start to run my hand down my stomach to my cock which is still buried in the sheet below it and my hand slides up to my nipples, which are sticking through the top of the sheet and it feels pretty good.</p> <p>While I'm thinking about the night, in my dream I was dreaming about my sister. The one who taught me how to eat pussy and lick her to orgasm, how she fucked while she was fucking a young guy on her back and how she had the best orgasm of her life even on top, the one she gave me that night that her brother used his huge cock to fill her up. And how she looked like a little girl once, as she held her legs in the air with her feet hanging from my bedposts, watching herself in the mirror with a smile on her face and a smile on her face.</p> <p>So much that I don't even remember my sister and what is that feeling of power about to come over me. I can't take much more to say, and so I go ahead with the plan.</p> <p>First things first, I need to get my mouth on my sister.</p> <p>My sister says I need to do something about all of that while she's asleep. I look down at the sheet and it's just starting to go completely transparent and the sheet is actually coming off. So I try to get the sheet completely down my body without being completely covered. I take a deep breath, and then take a deep breath, take a deep breath and go for it this time. With my lips and tongue I try to lick my lips and stick out my tongue. I lick my lips and then push them out a few inches.</p> <p>"I have to try something something for you to use as your mouth on me."</p> <p>"You don't have to do that, I won't bite." I tell her.</p> <p>"I want you too." She says to me.</p> <p>"Let's do it then, you need to practice." She said.</p> <p>I look past the sheet to my sister and start to see her standing next to the tub with her face towards me and she's looking at me with a smile.</p> <p>I look back to my sister. She looks back at me and smiles but now her head is in profile to my cock. She has her eye on my face, which look just weird but I don't want to stare her eye in her face. I think I have a pretty good idea of where this will lead.</p> <p>I see her reach out a hand to me as I look back at my sister. She's on her knees in front of me, still standing right in frontâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
