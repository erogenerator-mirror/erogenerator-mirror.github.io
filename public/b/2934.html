I don't really give a damn. This feels good. Don't let that pressure stop. Don't stop -</p> <p>- Oh my! That is so good - she is going to come. You are making it feel even better. -</p> <p>So I was getting close, so close! I didn't have time to do anything, because she took over. She said "Don't hold back" again, while she started playing with me again. And it went on like that for several minutes as she went all the way on. The only problem was I came again! She had to make me stop but somehow, even if I did, she did it even better than I had felt. She pulled her head up and her hand went to my face. She smiled a bit and looked in my eyes. "That was great! I could watch you get better without a hand! You look so good... I wish I had a hand instead." She leaned down and kissed me.</p> <p>- Well... what do you think of my idea? -</p> <p>I smiled and said "Yes, it would be great." She blushed and grinned. That's quite a boost to my ego. She looked up and said "I know what I want to try next. But you have to leave it there after I try it. -</p> <p>- Okay. I have no problem with that. I think I have a couple suggestions for you. -</p> <p>- Let's think about other ways to go about it. - I could ask her to bring a vibrator to work for me.</p> <p>- Yes! We can try that. - She grinned. - You are as good as your photo. I won't be disappointed. Then we can go right on ahead.</p> <p></p> <p>- You better make sure you get a vibrator. You know, you aren't the only one around here who wants to get off with that old man's cock. -</p> <p>When we were in the bedroom, I had her on her back, holding her arms in the air. I was working my own cock into her vagina, while she had a nipple in one hand and had her other on her own breast. She was moaning. I said "I am very close" and started stroking in and out. She was moving her hips and saying "Do it" over and over again. I was in her. As I stroked into her, her hips were rocking and she was holding me close with her legs.</p> <p>After what seemed like forever she was saying "I am coming!" and I was doing it too. She was bucking against me and moaning and moving against me. When she stopped, I was still. She smiled and said "You were very good", and started moving her hips again.</p> <p>- Do that over and over again. - She started doing that. - She had gotten to a point of stopping and then saying "I want you to fuck me. Now!" I had a moment to think "Is she crazy? I mean, this is crazy? That's not even happening?"</p> <p></p> <p>- Come again with me. -</p> <p>- Yes! - It has been a while, but we did it again. "I can't believe how great this feels! - She smiled.</p> <p>- You do feel great! - I didn't feel it the first time, though I was close. - I can feel you pulsing within me and I can't wait for you to come in me!" And I took that to mean that she was ready to orgasm again.</p> <p>- I do feel good! - She was breathing heavy as I kept on. When she came, she shivered. She was breathing heavy but kind of quiet. She smiled and said "You do feel great. -</p> <p>- That was the first time - So now we have to take a shower in front of you.</p> <p>- What are you thinking? - She laughed and gave me a playful slap on my butt.</p> <p>- I think we should finish these pictures. We need one, to be sure.</p> <p>- How am I supposed to do that? -</p> <p>- Well, I don't know. - She seemed to think so. She asked "How am I supposed to use this?" - I was grinning as I tried to get out, but couldn't.</p> <p></p> <p>- Do you want me to fuck you? - I started thinking. She smiled and then went on saying "Are you kidding?"</p> <p>- I don't know. - I don't think I can. - I don't know if I am up to. - I was smiling. She shrugged, leaned up and started kissing me. As she got closer and more passionate, I had no option but to follow her lead.
