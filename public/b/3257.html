"I'm still a bit sore. I think I'll call you," as she picked up her phone.</p> <p>"Just a second," I said, before heading to the shower, not wishing to see any of my wife's lovely, beautiful body as I stripped away my clothes as I leaned my head into the streaming water.</p> <p>It was a few long moments before she turned on the shower's cold water, which seemed to cause me to stiffen, which, in turn, brought my still stiff cock back to life and I was tempted to start jerking off, but I didn't. I heard footsteps on the tile floor as I stood under the showerhead above the water. I waited patiently for her to turn off the showerhead, which I thought was to catch the rest of my sperm, but she just so happened to be standing right in front of me as my hand instinctively slid toward the drain as the cold cold water of the showerhead drizzled down onto me.</p> <p>I heard her giggling and I felt a little sorry for myself as I stood, embarrassed, wondering what had happened. "Oh my god, what did you do with your hand! You just came in here!" she said laughingly as she stepped into the now cold shower. I felt a little guilty realizing how excited I had been after she had made fun of my erection, but after we'd showered in the shower I still couldn't get her out of my mind. Finally she turned the showerhead off and stepped back with a wicked smile.</p> <p>"So did you like it?" she asked as she looked down at my crotch, which must have been dripping already from the shower's cold water.</p> <p>I laughed. "Yeah a little, just a little," I replied.</p> <p>"Yeah, I know exactly what you mean," she beamed. "So you know what you're doing now, right?" she asked innocently.</p> <p>"Oh yeah," I smiled, as she grabbed a bottle of shampoo from the dispenser. "What I really want is, after that shower, you can keep the soap handy for me to clean up my back."</p> <p>"What's that mean?" she teased. "Like I want you to keep your soaps?"</p> <p>I nodded at her in answer. "Yeah, a couple of times. I think it's so much better to have a clean, fresh body."</p> <p>She smiled at me and I could tell by the way she was smiling at my body. "Well, you better make sure you keep my soaps handy," she said, and began to shampoo my hair.</p> <p>It was still warm so I let her work on it for a couple of moments and then stepped back as she stood. "Here, you wash my back for me, silly," she laughed as she began to massage soap into my back, which was now clean. She turned me around as she rinsed my hair and soaped up her hands, then began to rub lotion on my shoulders. "It's nice to get a good, clean back for you," she said. "You better not get tired, you've got a busy day ahead of you," she went on to tease me. I sighed with relief in fact. "Come on," she said, as she led me out into the hallway to the master bedroom.</p> <p>The bedroom was more like it, with a queen sized bed, a vanity in one corner, chairs and a bathroom on each side of the bed. "The bathroom is on the right," she explained as she pointed toward the vanity. "This is where you can look at the mirror while you jack off over there!"</p> <p>I giggled. "Ok, so you can't really jack off in there, can you?" She laughed. "See, I have a different hair look to it all, so no one can be a prude at your expense," she said.</p> <p>"Well, come on in and we'll see a whole new side to you," I said.</p> <p>As she began to walk toward the bathroom I could see her ass jiggle a bit as she walked. "I think I'm going to like this," she said, and walked into the bathroom. She turned the shower on again, but only a little bit more water than it needed. I could tell she was getting aroused. "Come on," she said, as she stepped to the foot of the bed. "Come on and join me in here," she said as she laid down on the floor, "Come and join me in this shower," she asked as she picked up the shampoo bottle.</p> <p>I couldn't believe it as it was a surprise to find that it actually was so much heavier thanâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
