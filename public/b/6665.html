"But do not call me. You'll end up spending the rest of your life alone."</p> <p>"I'm sure," she said honestly. "You were always the one who seemed the calm voice."</p> <p>"We'll see," he responded, and then turned around the desk while he went back to work, closing the curtain behind him. "I'm going home. This is just a little bit more fun. I hope you'll stay." he teased in his head.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'd love to stay," she responded. "I'd definitely enjoy doing more."</p> <p>"What was that?" he asked. "I asked if you were free this weekend."</p> <p>"I'd rather be with you. If I had to make a choice I'd choose this weekend," she replied. "I have a date to meet Michael this weekend. I'll be back late this week." she leaned forward and then smiled. "Can I have your number?" she asked.</p> <p>"Maybe another time," Michael replied sarcastically.</p> <p>"OK, fine then," she replied, and then walked down the hall to her room.</p> <p>Michael stared at her walking away. He wanted to have her right there. He wanted to feel her lips against his neck. He wanted to feel her body as it molded around him. He wanted to feel her tongue in his mouth. The next few minutes passed by all of them were just like that. It was a little bit of a blur to his mind. They couldn't be sure if he was just dreaming. The thought of having someone as young or young as she was now turned him on. He hadn't even thought about the possibility of sex with a woman he didn't really love.</p> <p>"I'm coming," Beth yelled from downstairs as she dashed down the stairs. "I'm coming for a visit."</p> <p>Oh what the hell. He'll have her before she knows it. He heard her get up and hurried down the stairs. This was so much more than he originally had in mind. He felt that if he went to bed tomorrow night he'd never see her.</p> <p>She pulled into his drive way and saw no one there.</p> <p>"I'll see you tomorrow," she said as she got out of the car.</p> <p>"Oh, good night then," he said quietly to himself as he walked up to her door and knocked softly.</p> <p>"What's up with you?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't just live here. I moved into this house a couple of months ago," he replied.</p> <p>"So you're really going to see me on a regular basis?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yeah," he replied. "Hopefully before we leave on Tuesday. Maybe not as often, but sometimes."</p> <p>"I'd love to be with you." she said.</p> <p>Michael didn't know how to feel. The way she talked and the way she acted tonight just made him feel a little bit better. She might have a couple nights more of her life planned out. What she had in mind was different than he did. He wanted to be with her and he knew that they had to go on a mission.</p> <p>"Where are we going tonight?" he asked.</p> <p>"We're going to dinner," she responded with a grin. "I invited the best friend of the guy who lives down the street. I asked him to pick me up and he said yeah. So tomorrow night is going to be a date." a big grin appeared.</p> <p>They got out of the car and walked into the house. It was dark. The hall had been dimmed now. All he could see of the room was the back wall. He didn't know if she was doing anything or not, but he felt like he was falling deeper into it now. As they walked up the stairs they noticed a door with the number '10'. He knocked again and was greeted with the sound of the lock opening. The bedroom looked exactly as he remembered, but even more so if it wasn't her in the bed with him. She was on the bed naked with her clothes laid out on the floor.</p> <p>Michael's heart raced as he stood in the doorway and held the door open for her. After a moment of holding his breath and waiting for her to turn around and come into the room he held the door as wide as he could.</p> <p>"Well hi, so nice to see you here."</p> <p>"Hi, nice to see you too," she responded as she came into the room.</p> <p>"I know we just called, but I thought you'd want to come." he said sincerely.</p> <p>"Well why don't we get a fire started. I can get out of having the whole house to ourselves."</p> <p>"That would be great," he smiled.</p> <p>He stood in front of her and slowly began toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
