When we get home I’ll tell you what happened this morning. If you can’t tell your husband why it took so long, I don’t think I will hear from you again,” he said with sincerity.</p> <p>I smiled. “Thank you,” I said with a little more strength in my voice which made him wonder how a man could be at such a loss of strength.</p> <p>“No, thank you,” he said softly. “It was my pleasure,” he said finally.</p> <p>We left the bar and he gave me a key which he handed to me. I thought that would give me a break and get this over with, and he took me to a long narrow corridor with a long door. I looked at him and he was waiting for me, his body still a little sweaty from the walk, but now much stronger. We entered the long hallway, and entered a door, which was large and high enough for me to pass through and walk through, and I stepped through the door. We stood outside the door for a moment, him with his arm behind his head and me with my right arm wrapped tight. As the door closed behind us, he gently pushed me against the door. I closed my eyes, but did not say a word as he pushed his tongue inside my mouth and we kissed deeply.</p> <p>As we kissed I felt a little scared, and almost shy at having a man like this wanting me in such a dangerous place. After a while he reached around me and grabbed my ass. He lifted me up so that I could rest my head on his chest as he continued to kiss my forehead and eyes. It felt so safe here in this manor that he didn’t care that I was still clothed, all he wanted to do was take me in his arms again.</p> <p>After a few moments he moved his hands around me and started to unzip my dress. I felt it fall to the ground around me and he took it from me and tossed it aside. In a few moments I was naked once again, except for a very sexy pair of panties that were barely hiding the fact that I was not wearing anything sexy. It took me only moments to realize that they were just a touch above the panties.</p> <p>“It looks very nice,” he said when I looked down at myself in his arms, and he gave a little gasp in his throat. “Thank you,” he murmured. “I really like this outfit,” he added without being too friendly. “It looks so pretty on you,” he said.</p> <p>“I love it,” I answered with a smile. “And I think it looks better that way.”</p> <p>He took his right hand and pulled me around the hall towards a small room on the right. My eyes were now adjusted to his eyes even though I could see his pupils, and now he had a big smile on his face. Before he let me go he placed his right hand on my shoulder and pulled me towards him.</p> <p>“Are you ready for this,” he asked as he lifted the hem of my dress all the way up to my shoulders.</p> <p>“Yes,” I said.</p> <p>He looked deeply into my eyes and asked again. “Are you ready for this,” he asked again.</p> <p>“I am” I said, and I was really getting into this. “I am ready for this. I just don’t think it will be long. Please don’t think that I am just going to lay out here and take off my shoes.”</p> <p>“Of course not,” he said as he released my body. “But I want you on the floor. Let’s go,” he said as we slowly came to the other end of the room.</p> <p>I was so excited, I couldn’t think where we were going. When both of us were in our room he turned to face me again. “Do you remember what I told you about not thinking about things in a new direction,” he said.</p> <p>“I have only been gone a few weeks now,” I answered.</p> <p>“That’s just like me,” he replied. “I know this is a huge step for you, but at least you are now getting a chance to show a lot of yourself and make a decision with your heart.”</p> <p>“Thank you,” I said, and he pulled me towards his arms and gave me a deep kiss. It was just what I had expected and was so much more than I might have hoped for.
