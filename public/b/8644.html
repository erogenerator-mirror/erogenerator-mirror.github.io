I'm not that kind of girl, that's for sure," she mumbles.</p> <p>"Then it shouldn't do any more to you or the business you've brought to this house. And I'd certainly appreciate it if you could return the favor?" I say after a few seconds' hesitation.</p> <p>"Maybe after lunch?" she grins. "I could use the break, I'll see you around noon."</p> <p>"I'm running late," I say. "Let me get this for you."</p> <p>I walk up the stairs to the kitchen and look for another way to get the food out of the refrigerator. When I get back, I throw the food onto the floor next to the sink. I throw my hands in my pockets and turn to see her come into my kitchen. I smile and she waves to me.</p> <p>"You know, I'm starving," she says.</p> <p>"Oh, you would be, too."</p> <p>"I would." I look at her as she hands me another plate. "Do you cook?"</p> <p>"No, not really. It's just that I'm really busy."</p> <p>"Is it better than working with your mom?" I ask.</p> <p>"Hard to say. She's like a third mom. And she's a very good cook. Or at least it's a good job when the job is done. And the sex... I guess you can say that's a part of it," she says. "But it can't be too bad."</p> <p>"I guess I can get a free breakfast, too."</p> <p>"I mean, if mom and I are lucky, would you like to go with me?" she asks.</p> <p>"Of course! Of course! You wouldn't mind if I got some lunch?" I ask. I don't really understand eating but it's nice.</p> <p>"Actually, I'd love for a breakfast!"</p> <p>"That's a wonderful idea!" I reply.</p> <p>We walk through the house, me carrying her bags, her carrying my lunch to the kitchen, and we head to our room. She climbs in bed as I lay down on the bed. I'm about to join her when she falls asleep in my arms.</p> <p>When I wake up in the morning, I'm naked, a little disheveled from the day but the feeling of her naked body is amazing. She's still in my arms, but I am getting harder and she's breathing faster. Her arms and legs are tangled in the sheets. Slowly, her breathing slows to something close to normal and she snuggles herself even closer against me.</p> <p>She kisses down my body, my earlobe kissing down my neck, my chest. Her fingers graze my cock and I groan in pleasure. Her fingers move down to my balls.</p> <p>"What about dinner on Saturday?" she asks as her hand massages me through my slacks.</p> <p>"I'd love that," I say.</p> <p>She rubs her fingers across the head of my cock and I push up against her hand.</p> <p>"I want that again," I say as I kiss her on the cheek gently.</p> <p>"I want that again," she whispers and I kiss her on the lips. She responds to my tongue in her mouth and I kiss my way down to her soft lips. The taste of my cock is so different than hers. I can tell this is the first time I've ever made her have sex, maybe the first time I've ever made her fuck someone.</p> <p>"I love you," I say when we break the kiss.</p> <p>"I love you, too," she says. She's back on her back with her mouth open and staring at the ceiling.</p> <p>I take off her shorts and panties and then her tank top and then her bra, which she has chosen to wear under her pajama. I love the feel of her skin in my hands and I slowly rub her nipples through the thin fabric of her bra. She arches her back and moans before I suck first one one and then the other into my mouth. I lick and nibble on both of her breasts as I rub the inside of her thighs and I don't stop until I feel her fingers digging into my hair.</p> <p>In a frenzy, I suck and kiss down her stomach to her pussy. I can tell that she wants me to stop or to come up for air. Eventually we collapse on either side of her on the bed. I kiss her neck and her face, her jaw, her face that I long to kiss away.</p> <p>"Mmm, you're sooo good," she growls when my tongue reaches her lipsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
