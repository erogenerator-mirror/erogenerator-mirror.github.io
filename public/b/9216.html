No one knows who owns his ass!"</p> <p>"Well, he got a cute little ass," I grinned.</p> <p>She took off my tie and untied my top so I was looking down at her in a way I hoped I'd never have gotten from her. I took off my shirt, and then her top, and she took off her pants, all while doing the same. She stopped for just a second to remove her underwear, with me in the middle and looked back at me. Smiling back at me, she looked back and asked, "Who goes first?"</p> <p>"If you keep doing that, my butt."</p> <p>"If you do it harder, I'll have a big bruise there."</p> <p>"Oh no, you don't want that, right?"</p> <p>"Yes, I want you to spank me," I replied, and she smiled and said, "Good, because I know why," before giving me a quick kiss.</p> <p>"Well, it really is a beautiful ass," I countered, then she went back to rubbing her cheeks together a bit while I rubbed mine. We both liked it because we loved spanking each other. I put my middle finger down her crack and found her hole and she wiggled her ass slightly. I took my other hand and moved it around around her cheeks a little more, and she seemed to like it.</p> <p>"I bet they would," I said.</p> <p>"Mmmm, I guess so," she said. "I'm still looking for more."</p> <p>I took my finger out and she lifted up, giving me room to slide a finger inside her, and she pushed her hips towards me so I could enter her easier. She took my hand of her anus and put it back down where it was, and then said, "I guess we should really get back into it some before we run out of time to kiss."</p> <p>The way I said it, she was still taking pleasure in my finger going inside her. "If you do it harder, I will not want it harder," she continued. "If I do it like this, it will hurt."</p> <p>"Well, it is just, I love playing with your ass, and I think it is sexy, so let me think about it," I offered.</p> <p>"Ok, whatever you want."</p> <p>We got back on the car and then leaned over, kissing and caressing. I moved my finger around inside her a bit and then I moved my finger back to her hole as a lubrication, and said, "It's not the only ass here."</p> <p>"Not just the ass either," she offered. "You must be a very kinky man, if you're thinking about sticking it up me, or even getting me used to it."</p> <p>"Maybe, if you let me," I offered.</p> <p>"Honey, you didn't seem like you were going to stop kissing me after sucking my finger. How about we try that again, it feels way too good to stop."</p> <p>"I guess you don't have to kiss me, unless you want me to leave my hand where it is, if you don't mind?"</p> <p>"Well, you are right, that would be a very horny man indeed."</p> <p>"Maybe I will take it up my ass before the day is over."</p> <p>I couldn't refuse that, and moved my finger around a bit in her hole a bit, and, after a bit, she moaned and spread her legs a bit. I pressed all the way, and then got my finger back in her hole. I could tell by her tone of voice that she didn't need a foreplay this time. I pushed forward hard, trying to put it all the way in, and finally felt it go in and went in nice and slow. This time she was really moaning and pushing her ass back against mine, and she was getting excited, as good as she felt in the car with my cock shoved up her ass. This time I didn't pull it out just to keep it there; this time I wanted to fuck her until she was in bliss with pleasure. And finally, she got her fingers back to her own crack and rubbed them, saying, "God, that feels so good. So, you are getting a bit rough there, though. Maybe it is not a bit painful, if you're really nice to your ass. That is, if it hurts at all."</p> <p>"I doubt it. This is all so nice," I said. "But what hurts is a little pain, isn't it. I don't know if it has even been hurt, by some guy, but it is not quite a little pain.
