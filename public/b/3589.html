We were eating, laughing and talking. After our lunch break, we picked up our phones and called a cab to pick us up. I took one, as Karen left one to her grandmother who was going on a trip to a friend of hers. We both agreed to wait a few more days before we went out. Then the phone rang once before we got out of bed, as we both had nothing on except our sleepwear. As we talked, I told her that I had a lot of work I had to do with this day and that I had to be there with her, or she would call me and not tell me.</p> <p>I picked up the phone, "Hi, this is the lady that you gave me a piece of yesterday, Ms. Kowalski. I'm sorry I called you, but I got on-call and forgot to be late to work. Can you come pick me up? I hope you like my outfit. I need to go now, but I'm on it - I'll meet you at the bar for another drink before I leave. Okay. Bye-bye."</p> <p>In a matter of minutes, we were at the bar in her Mercedes-Benz, talking and laughing, feeling warm, and comfortable. We had just finished our first shot of red wine when the phone rang. It was Karen saying that she had to work. She also informed I that she and her friend would be out of "trying to keep things the same".</p> <p>I could only laugh, feeling excited and nervous. All of a sudden, I was in the middle of an elevator, in which I stood up, walked up to her, kissed her gently and left to call her friend at her office. I had the time to get to her house, so she wouldn't know I was there before I got there. I didn't bother knocking, she was already there when I arrived. Her friend, Ms. Kowalski, greeted me, and we talked for a long time as we waited for Karen to arrive.</p> <p>We talked about our plans for today, our plans to meet her friend, Karen. Ms. Kowalski asked how things were going with our meeting. I told her that everything was cool, that I'd been thinking about the same thing most of the day, and that I knew she would probably be available. That I'm sure she thought I was crazy when I told her. She laughed a little at me and we talked about some other stuff. I could tell she was excited by all this.</p> <p>Ms. Kowalski asked, "How do you know Ms. Carver?"</p> <p>"She comes to me," I answered.</p> <p>"I'm here to please you," and with that, she left me standing before her, kissing me lightly on the lips. I smiled and felt a twinge in my pussy, because there was more than I had to say. Our kisses were so soft, and it was wonderful to be kissing her. I knew with the way this started out, I'd finally be able to please her.</p> <p>I kissed her again, feeling her hard nipples pressing against my chest as I felt for her dress. I started to undo the top of it, and it fell away to reveal two gorgeous breasts, large and beautiful, with small darker nipples. They were firm, and sat perfectly on her chest.</p> <p>I slid my hands to her breasts, feeling her hard nipples as I played with them. I kissed her again, her tongue darting across mine as I slid my hands down her body and cupped her ass. I kissed her slowly, letting her tell me how wonderful it felt to have me touch her. Finally after a long while, I slid my hands back up to her naked breasts and started to play with them, pulling on the nipples, lifting them, moving my hand over her flat stomach and sliding over to her crotch. She gasped when I touched her.</p> <p>I stopped her hand, and continued to kiss her, moving her hands to my head and gently touching my hair. With just one kiss, she went from kissing me to trying to undress me as I helped her. She wanted to, and I could tell that she didn't have too much of a desire to do so, because she was very hot. We broke our kiss to continue to kiss and caress each other. As I kissed and caressed her, I slid downward until I could touch her nipple with my tongue. It was hard, dark, and delicious as I felt it, tasting it, sucking it gently between my lips.</p> <p>Karen didn't try to undress me at first, we lay down on the bed with her arms around meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
