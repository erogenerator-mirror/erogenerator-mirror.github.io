Tara was annoyed.</p> <p>"Nothing," Josh reassured her.</p> <p>"No. I just wanted to see if you weren't having fun with Josh. He looks like he really loves being with someone," Josh said.</p> <p>"Yeah, it's funny," Tara replied with a shrug.</p> <p>"Oh, okay. I guess it's not like your father." Josh started.</p> <p>"Not me either. He's always the last one home alone. My mom had a broken leg last year and had to take home a broken hip."</p> <p>"So he must love it," Josh said.</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess," Tara shrugged.</p> <p>Josh moved his body weight from side to side as he watched Tara.</p> <p>"And he's the best layer guy that I've had," Josh said with a grin. "Do you like to try out his stories?"</p> <p>"Um...yeah, I'm kinda into them."</p> <p>"So do you ever think about sex anymore?" Josh cocked his head to the left and then right as he reached over to the night stand.</p> <p>"Only if it's not in the mood to," Tara lied.</p> <p>"You know, I do," Josh said while giving her a half smile. "Does that bother you?"</p> <p>"I guess," Tara said. "I don't really do it," she finished.</p> <p>"Me neither," Josh said.</p> <p>"I mean...I don't mean it to be nasty or anything. I just want to see what it's like."</p> <p>"And if it is?" Josh asked softly.</p> <p>"Well, yeah."</p> <p>"So you never did anything with him that might be fun?" Josh asked while he started to pull things out of his bag.</p> <p>"No. We're not that type of people."</p> <p>Josh nodded and closed the bag.</p> <p>"He's not some guy, right?" Josh asked but then hesitated.</p> <p>"Oh," Tara was slightly stunned. "What does that mean?"</p> <p>"We might end up having fun. I don't know. Just don't let yourself get all over me. You don't want to see me doing stuff with someone else just because a woman doesn't want to. You're too good an opportunity for just one guy," Josh assured her.</p> <p>"We're not, Josh," Tara stated.</p> <p>"Are you mad?" Josh asked.</p> <p>"No," Tara said. "I just don't have the heart to tell you that it's okay to try out Josh."</p> <p>"That's because you're too sweet to hate," Josh retorted.</p> <p>Tara leaned back against the headboard and reached out to Josh, wrapping her arm around his neck. "Thank you, Josh. That's nice to know."</p> <p>Josh kissed her and then leaned down and kissed her hard on the mouth.</p> <p>"What about what you said," Josh began. "About the 'not to stop, before I can cum,' thing?" Josh said.</p> <p>Tara leaned forward and ran her fingers through Josh's short blonde hair.</p> <p>"That's what I said," she responded. Josh smiled. "And I meant it."</p> <p>Josh smiled as well, as they kissed.</p> <p>"Do you want to stop then?" Josh asked.</p> <p>Tara nodded and said, "It was so hot! I can't wait for your cock to blow that big load of yours."</p> <p>Josh pulled away and then sat up against the headboard.</p> <p>"We're going to do this for a very long time," Josh smiled.</p> <p>"You're a good little man," Tara said with a smile.</p> <p>Josh pulled Tara's face down to his and kissed her.</p> <p>"I want to be your first," Josh said.</p> <p>"I don't care."</p> <p>Josh smiled and sat up.</p> <p>"Go get him, okay?" Josh nodded.</p> <p>Tara smiled and reached out for Josh. He kissed her.</p> <p>"We've got to stop this," Tara said. "We can't do this any more."</p> <p>"I understand," Joshua agreed.</p> <p>* * * * * *</p> <p>When Josh and Tara got to Josh and Tim's house, they got a surprise. Josh had gotten the bag off the bike. Before getting on the couch, Josh pulled out his phone.</p> <p>"Hey Tim and I decided to come over and see what you're up to. Do you want to play with us?" Josh asked.</p> <p>"That would be nice," Tim agreed.</p> <p>Josh got off the couch and sat down next to Timâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
