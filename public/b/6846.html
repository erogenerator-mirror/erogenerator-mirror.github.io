That's very good." Her hand started stroking his cock, her left hand firmly stroking the back of it, her right hand stroking his balls. She was clearly getting horny by herself, and it made it easier to feel him as she rubbed up and down his cock.</p> <p>"Oh, I feel like we have some time before you're going to cum all over me." And with that she pulled her hand back and put her mouth over his cock once more, moaning from the sensation as she did so. "You ready, baby?" he murmured back, as he pulled his hand from her pussy and held it in front of her face.</p> <p>"I am, and I want you in me. Now." With that she took him by the hand and led him back into the bedroom where she lay down on the bed, and pulled the nightshirt she was wearing to the side. She spread the hair on her body, one foot on one side of the bed, and pulled the shirt up, baring her perfectly shaped breasts. "Come fuck me!" She practically demanded, raising her ass off the bed to invite him in. He pulled his shorts down and slid his cock into her in one smooth and easy move.</p> <p>She moaned loudly as he hit bottom, the vibrations of the mattress against her crotch making her whole body tense and quiver, as his large hands caressed her breasts and stomach and upper chest, his fingers stroking the sensitive underside at the base of her neck and jawline. He leaned over her, kissing her lips and letting his chest brush up against hers as he moved his body inside of hers, sliding his own in and out of hers while he sucked at her nipples.</p> <p>"Caleb..." she breathed, as she felt and experienced every single thrust his cock made, with his balls slapping against her pussy from each and every stroke. "Make me cum."</p> <p>He grinned as he increased the tempo of his stroking, and started to buck into her harder and faster, pulling his cock out and slamming it back into her. Her arms went around his shoulders and her body spasmed against him, her head fell backwards and her eyes clenched tight shut. And then everything went quiet and she couldn't feel him any more.</p> <p>He let out a long sigh, and pulled his lips from her nipples to kiss her as their bodies came back down together, his hands starting to play with her breasts again. They lay there, their chests heaving, and he stroked her hair. "I had a good time, Jen.... I really did." He pulled himself up and kissed her on the mouth. "How did you like it?"</p> <p>"It was absolutely amazing." She smiled back at him. "But I think you still have something for me." And she grinned from ear to ear.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" His mouth opened a little, and she reached up and ran her hand up and down his chest as she pulled his lips to hers again. Her tongue danced with one of his lips as his hand stroked her neck, and she took his hand in hers again as they kissed on the mouth.</p> <p>"I think in a way I've actually enjoyed this very much, you know." She looked down at his cock as it lay between them, and laughed. "And you're still hard!" But she was just smiling. "So how is it for you?"</p> <p>"Well, I think it's quite special." He reached up to run his fingers through her hair, and she moved her head, and they kissed for a while longer. He stroked her hair, as they laid there, their bodies covered in sweat, and she ran her fingers through it, feeling it's softness in her hand.</p> <p>"This has been quite the weekend, hasn't it?" He rolled her over, and she quickly pulled herself up onto her knees. He helped her pull her pants down, and she helped remove her top, before pulling his shorts off as well. "That's really lovely," she said as he sat up on the edge of the bed.</p> <p>"We're not done yet." He reached out his arms to her, and she pulled him in. "Lay back and let me." Then her eyes went back to his cock as she leaned back again, the sheets moving against her ass as he ran his fingers down her inner thigh. He ran his fingers lightly over her pussy, feeling how wet it was. "And let's try something new," he said, and brought his hand up to caress her lips, then the clit, as she leaned her head back and opened her legs, exposing herself to him.</p> <p>"Do you want me to do something?" she asked, as she moved her free hand from his shaft to move down, finding his cock to be rock hard in her hands. "Or do you want me to sit on your headâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
