It seemed she was being squeezed and squeezed...the pain, the hunger she felt, the hunger to know what it would feel like to have a cock in her mouth, or in her ass! No, it was something else that had been there. She looked around the room again and realized that she loved the feeling of the walls closing on her, so she knew that she hated being there. But this night...this... this was, so very much like how she had imagined it to be. She realized that she was getting an erection, that the bed creaked with her heavy breathing. She pushed her knees together and looked around the room again. There was nothing there for anyone to watch.</p> <p>It came to her at that moment that the idea of having a cock in her pussy would be as arousing as masturbating. Not only physically, but emotionally as well as the mental. They should be on and on about it. But she didn't know just how much pleasure this would bring, what it would feel like to have a cock in her, in her vagina. She found that she wanted it too...she'd never really been this happy.</p> <p>As the evening went on and she watched the men, she found her own interest growing. Her own arousal, she discovered, was growing. There was so much passion in this; she found herself feeling it all. Her arousal grew with each new person to approach, each new sexual encounter brought on by the others. There were a great many men here tonight, and there was so much more. She felt completely used.</p> <p>The next night, as soon as they were through the door, it was just like all the other nights. One woman wanted it with her and one woman wanted her; it was all so much more than just to be held; it was more than the love that it was to be made love to by another woman for the love of her lover. It wasn't just to be made love to, as she knew it would be but to have him, to let him feel every nook and cranny of her, to touch, to lick. And it wasn't just the lust and excitement of being watched that turned the desire for penetration into a sexual frenzy. It wasn't just the pleasure of having a man in her vagina, on her, in her ass, over her...it was more than the excitement of having men all around her being used by a woman.</p> <p>She also realized that tonight was going to be different, different in ways that she had never experienced before - even though she knew that they shouldn't. It all seemed so foreign, and new, this was all so intense. There was no sense of guilt and embarrassment, it was just a way to feel what it was like to be used, to feel an orgasm in a woman was a natural thing. It was an experience of sexual pleasure, no-one's business but her own. It was a moment made sweeter than all she'd ever known; not just to be a slut, but to be a submissive - all of it was a feeling of power and self-discovery, something she could never let come to the real world. No-one would think otherwise.</p> <p>They continued. This time, they went to a strip bar; this time it was the one in the middle of the room. The patrons had gone home to watch and smoke. She saw a couple of them watching her as she slid her skirt to the floor. He looked at her and she could sense the thrill of this as she raised her hand to him. He shook his head, and she saw his mouth drop as he looked at her. She felt her face flush as her eyes filled with lust and she felt a warm flash surge through her body. He reached out and she took his hand in hers. They stood for a moment holding hands, and then he led her from the bar.</p> <p>The other men watched attentively, their eyes never leaving her; they could almost feel their interest and desire for her. She felt like every eye in the place had turned to look at her; to want her, to want to taste her; all they saw was a naked woman dancing in front of them: her breasts bouncing with her hips in time with the rhythm of the music with which she was dancing. As they watched, they felt that she was as much a part of the evening's performance as the other men were. They could tell what they wanted, what they felt. And she wanted to feel it. She wanted him to hold her...her breasts...his mouth on her...her thighs. They wanted her to put her head on him as he held her in his arms.</p> <p>They walked slowly to the bar; she knew that the other men in the place had been watching her and she saw that many of them could see their own lust. They watched her fromâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
