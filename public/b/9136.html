"So, what are you getting tonight?"</p> <p>"Oh, nothing that I can't do to pleasure myself. I've got more for you."</p> <p>"Is that a surprise?"</p> <p>"Oh, no. No surprises," I smiled.</p> <p>The door opened and we both froze. He was there, smiling and shaking his head. We turned to greet him. He held out his arms and we hugged. We exchanged several kisses before he stepped back. I stood there, a little stunned. I hadn't expected to have to touch him, but the excitement had been so overwhelming that I hadn't minded it at all. It was as if the attraction was mutual. I thought about how many orgasms he had and how many I had experienced.</p> <p>In a moment his arms moved to release me. I was a little disappointed when he looked back at me, and when I wasn't, he moved forward and touched the swollen tip of his erect cock to my lips. With a groan, I licked over it. I had been so eager to do so, even fantasizing about it, that I had almost let it slip before, but now, I just felt a little guilty. I wanted to experience it, but I knew it would only take a bit. I licked it again and then he guided it to my opening. I thought it was going to happen, but I held back even more. He pushed a bit more. It slipped in. He started to move it in and out, but it was tight again.</p> <p>"God, I'm so glad the other guys didn't let me," I thought as he looked me over. "It's going to take me a while to get used to it," I thought to myself.</p> <p>Gradually, I felt the head of his cock go farther inside me. I was getting really excited, almost in spite of himself. I hadn't consciously considered it. I could feel myself getting wetter and hotter. He started to move more of his cock in. He could feel me getting more excited. My breath was coming in quick gasps. I was starting to panic again. "Please," I thought, "please, don't."</p> <p>When he got me very wet, he reached under me and started to stroke my clitoris. I felt him working it, just like he always did and he knew how. "Oh, God!" I thought, "This is going to be fantastic."</p> <p>I thought of everything that had been going on between that afternoon and that evening before. "This is a wonderful time!" I was thinking. I didn't want this, didn't want it at all, but right now, I didn't care. I just wanted to experience it, to feel it, to feel good again.</p> <p>He started to pump slowly. I was moaning, even though I could barely hear myself. "God, this is so nice," I thought. I never wanted this to be over."</p> <p>The whole thing came to me in a moment. I was at the point where my orgasm couldn't possibly be far away. I had never been with a man with such a big cock before and it felt incredible to have him doing it to me. I never felt with anyone before, and it was something completely new. He had always been gentle, almost like a lover. Now, he was a little bigger but still inside me. I could feel him all the way inside, and I wanted it to stay there for a while, to feel him moving inside me again. "Oh God! Now! Now! Oh God!", I thought as I came again. I couldn't describe it, and not think about it, but it came like a big wave. I felt him moving even more slowly but the sensation was the same.</p> <p>After a minute, he withdrew. He smiled at me. "You liked that, didn't you?" He asked. I nodded. He looked at to see my wetness on my belly, but didn't comment.</p> <p>I stood there, a little confused, my legs trembling, when he held out his hand and said, "Come on, dance for me. I don't want to keep you up."</p> <p>Without any hesitation, I lifted my arms and slipped one hand behind my back and slid it over across my ass. His eyes were on my breasts as they swayed there. It was exciting. I could feel myself getting wetter as we danced.</p> <p>In an instant, two of us lost the bra. My breasts were bouncing freely as he squeezed them. I felt his cock throb as it came to rest against them, pressed against me while we danced. There was no hurry; we just enjoyed each other as we danced.</p> <p>After a minute or so, it started to get uncomfortable. And that was only natural.
