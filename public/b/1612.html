'Yeah, right, you stupid girl,' I thought. 'I should be apologizing to you for something.' I could understand that feeling of disappointment, so I tried to explain. 'I'm sorry that that stuff has got to get around.'</p> <p>She took my hand. 'It doesn't. I want you to go with me, too. It was fun but I want to do it again.' She squeezed my hand again. 'It's a good thing we're a lot alike in how we express our inner feelings. We really care about each other.'</p> <p>I had to agree with that. The feeling was amazing. She was a wonderful lover. And she knew exactly what to say right there in front of me – and so did I. We were in total bliss together.</p> <p>It wasn't long before we fell asleep together.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The next day I made the usual breakfast by the time I got home. I changed into a pair of jeans and decided to go to a bar-and-high club in the nearby town. The club, even for Saturday evening it was a little unusual. I'd been there before with friends but I didn't like it – it seemed a bit sleazy – and the club had a few tables in it and had the bar-stool staff, along with the bartender, sitting at the high table that one of the guys had earlier. I'm sure you know the rest of the customers – waitresses or waitresses in the morning. It was in small booths that you usually sat facing each other.</p> <p>I didn't want to stand in the middle of the place looking like a pervert. I had planned to wait until the music was slow to dance but the loud noise from the dance floor got in the way of my mood. When I sat myself down opposite Alice, she pulled me into a soft hug.</p> <p>'Thank you for coming.'</p> <p>We looked at each other for a couple of moments.</p> <p>'So?' I asked.</p> <p>She pulled back. 'So do you think we can get together, again?'</p> <p>I was unsure how to bring the subject up. 'It was a good idea. I'd like to. I mean, I want to be close to you. More than that.'</p> <p>It was an easy one to say, but after a moment I couldn't find the right words. I decided that we'd talk about another few days.</p> <p>The bartender was already on duty. I was happy to find him on Friday or Saturday, but I was actually hoping to stay out all night. And I really hadn't had a chance.</p> <p>'Hey, that guy you're with is my boyfriend, right?' asked Alice.</p> <p>I smiled, 'Yeah.' I wasn't sure what to do now that the subject with my girlfriends idea had been resolved.</p> <p>'How do you feel about him?' she asked.</p> <p>'I don't know how I feel about anyone in my situation,' I replied.</p> <p>'What's he like?' she asked. The alcohol had done good to her mood, I thought.</p> <p>'A bit of a creep sometimes,' I said, trying to lighten the mood. I couldn't remember the last time I had come home drunk from a bar with two girlfriends. It was all the same, so I didn't feel very concerned about it.</p> <p>'Is he nice?' asked Alice.</p> <p>'He's not nice. His friends are nice too, you know. I don't know how they would feel about me if we were separated.'</p> <p>'Well, I'm not so sure. Have you talked to my father, about it?' She asked.</p> <p>'No. Just that I was leaving him for someone else.'</p> <p>'Are you sure he's nice? Can I come with?' she persisted. I didn't think she wanted to hear about my father, but I couldn't begrudge her a good fucking if he was nice.</p> <p>'Yes,' I said, almost apologetically.</p> <p>'Yeah, you can come with me. I don't feel right staying away. I know you two aren't together forever,' she continued, 'but we can still get together.' She paused for a moment.</p> <p>'What? Are you sure that's what you want?' I asked.</p> <p>'I'm sure. Besides, his boyfriend left right after we broke up.' She smiled slightly.</p> <p>'But how can I get you, if I'm not coming with?' I was starting to get nervous, but it was the truth. She'd said that she was willing to go with me, and I was willing to do the same.</p> <p>'OK, that's fine.'</p> <p>'OK—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
