Fuuuck! Uuuggh!" I moaned, as I plunged my head back as my orgasm erupted. Spasm after spasm ripped through my body, the waves of pleasure never before felt by me. I was completely exhausted, but knew that it would not be long before I again became aroused again. "Oh! Oh fuck!" I moaned, as waves of orgasm still gushed through me. I collapsed back onto the pillows, exhausted and satisfied. I must never get tired of having this sex toy as my Master, I thought.</p> <p>After a few minutes of just laying in the bliss and contentment of my climax and the heat and energy that had been generated, I got up and went to the bathroom to rinse off the remnants of my orgasm and give my Master His own.</p> <p>I made sure that my pussy was well cleaned and thoroughly lubed up, as I looked over my own body for a possible next time. I also took note that I was still naked, which wasn't unusual until I was kneeling in front of my Mistress, my pussy dripping with a mixture of my juices and Master's semen on his hard cock. As soon as I had finished, I went to the bedroom where I found the dress. This dress, although very revealing and classy, was still a bit more conservative than I normally wore, but it was still my preference. Now, dressed in a sexy and sexy set of bra and panties, I thought that this would be a very nice outfit. I looked at myself in the mirror, checking that I looked good, then made for the car.</p> <p>As soon as I arrived, my Master opened the door and helped me into the front seat, then handed me the dress. "What now slave?" He asked.</p> <p>"Now that we got home, I want more. How could I refuse? If I go too soon, Master will not love me..." I said.</p> <p>"I think you know that what you are asking for isn't being a good slave. You are now in total charge, and will be more like Master when you need to be."</p> <p>"Thank you Master." I replied, thinking that I must really want to be called Master.</p> <p>The ride home from the restaurant was very interesting. I couldn't help wondering what Master would think if he knew that I was thinking about my former Master, and wondering what he was going to say when he saw this dress she had on. When we got to Mom and Dad's house, just as the sun was starting to set over the hills, we saw that Mom and Dad didn't seem to be getting any food either. And they both looked rather tired. I tried not to stare at Mom's cleavage, wondering what my Master would think if he knew about my "slave" desire to be with my former Master.</p> <p>"That's okay, Dear. I will eat." He assured me.</p> <p>As expected, while Mom and Dad were getting what they needed and were ready to go back to school, Mom and Dad got out of the car and walked upstairs. Mom quickly put her hair in a ponytail, and went out to the family room to have a drink.</p> <p>Once Mom was out of sight for a moment, I got in the driver's seat.</p> <p>"So, Slave." I started. "Would you like some wine?" I asked.</p> <p>Mom looked up from the conversation that was going on in her head. "Yes, Sir."</p> <p>"And would you like your Master to order you something?" I suggested.</p> <p>"Oh yes, Sir!" she said, "I would be happy to have a glass of wine and have a glass of wine with my new Master."</p> <p>I smiled, and then handed her an envelope. She pulled out of the driveway and began loading the car.</p> <p>"May I?" I asked.</p> <p>"Of course, Sir." she said with a bright smile.</p> <p>To be continuedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
