I wasn't sure how it came to be I was almost certain that as I got closer to the actual orgasm I was about to experience with my own hand, I'd had to keep going until I'd exploded. Even then my body shuddered like a madwoman.</p> <p>I couldn't see him but I could imagine his hands as they groped at me, his kisses deep, as if he were trying to suck up the wetness between my legs. His mouth was open and looking up at me as his hands went a little further still on me; as though he wanted to go even further; and he pushed me back so I fell against his desk.</p> <p>It seemed there was still plenty of time left to be with him and it took him less than an hour to get me ready to go. There never were any questions. The only thing in my mind I knew at that moment was that as much as I liked it - as much as it excited me - as much as I liked it I wanted to take it more. "You're ready, I can see that already." He said with a light chuckle as he stood up just ahead of me. He went to the door and closed the curtains behind us.</p> <p>"Now what are we waiting for. Just get down here and stick your tongue into me." He said as the door closed behind us. As soon as the door was shut I saw a tall, well muscled man about to fuck me. The man started off slowly, but soon began to pick up speed. First he was slamming into me, and the sweat beads were forming and running down the face of my neck and chest. It was the second time that we had been in and my cunt was getting even wetter. I'd already forgotten the whole story; about the other guy wanting me but then being so horny that I was too sore to use a dildo and I was more turned on than I thought I'd ever been.</p> <p>"Fuck me, fuck me like you're fucking another woman!" I cried out as he continued his frenetic pace. He stopped momentarily and reached under me again to cup my breasts in one hand. This time he pulled up to a kneeling position and I was surprised to see that his cock was hard, not to the point of leaving the hole in my vagina but not to rock the seat. There was still plenty of room for him, if not more, if it still wasn't for my lack of lubrication there would be no doubt he would be able to plow my pussy as much as he wanted to have it.</p> <p>"I wanted to fuck that woman, but now that you're here it looks like she's been enjoying what you're doing." He went on.</p> <p>"Oh that feels great! Now just fuck me, please!" I cried out, and he quickly flipped me over and pushed my ass down to the ground. As I was doing so I felt his fingers enter me from the front as he pressed his cock up to my cunt. As I felt him push it in I wanted it all. I couldn't believe that I could actually get used to the size of his cock and how good it felt. The other person had done similar things and my cunt was a little more accommodating. I could feel an orgasm building up in my stomach and as I realized this all my movements became jerky.</p> <p>"Oh my God! That feels great, it's getting better!" I cried out.</p> <p>He pushed his cock a little further in and said, "You're about ready, now take it out." As I was pushing down and pushing up with what felt like my cunt, my vagina had taken him all but half way in. I could feel the shaft moving just a second before this first sensation drove me into a frenzy of excitement. I could feel his cock expanding and knew he was there, his whole body tensing, I could feel his head throbbing and I could feel his body trembling as he came deep in my belly.</p> <p>We stayed in each other's arms for a minute or two and then he rolled over to the side and took my hand which again I hadn't noticed had joined him, and led me to the washroom.</p> <p>"Now what did you think you were going to use?" I asked him. I'd had no idea what to do with my hands so I just used them to try to push away and hold myself up for a bit, my feet were a little cold, but my cunt clamped down on my fingers when we went in, which it did as much as I'd thought.</p> <p>"You liked that didn't you, didn't you?" He asked me. I didn't reply, Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
