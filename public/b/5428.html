She asked as she ran her hands down his chest and stomach as his mouth came down to her shoulder.</p> <p>"He was trying to be a father, and he had to stop when he got an idea in to be able to go along with something." She said, putting her arm around him as she moved up to kiss him. "He was just saying that he would love to be a father of my brothers...."</p> <p>Caleb could feel a pang of sympathy for the boy in her voice, and wondered what it would be like to be a parent himself. As his body pressed against her he could feel himself harden as a little of his own guilt was swept away by it and a bit of desire surged to him, as if he had been there all the time.</p> <p>After a moment of hesitation he pulled back and looked into her eyes; "Are you serious? Are you sure? You really want to be in bed with a guy all by yourself?"</p> <p>"Well I thought...I don't know....I mean I don't know...but, I don't know..." She said, taking a deep breath. "I have to admit I haven't been in a long-term relationship or even had a boyfriend or a real girlfriend and I've never thought about having sex with anybody. Even then I thought it might be different... I guess...it might just be the novelty of the situation that attracts me. You'd be just like a guy, right?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes," Caleb replied as he started to move towards her, sliding his hands under her coat which she had on before they'd even started kissing.... She could see his fingers slide under her dress and as they reached the top of her dress his left hand reached the band of the panties between her legs before he took hold of the fabric, and started sliding them off her legs.</p> <p>"And...." He said before he got even farther, and she could see that he was staring at her face as he reached up with both hands, slowly sliding the panties down until he could feel her skin. "And just as soon as you see a guy in your underwear, or with a cock, you're the hottest thing I know who's here."</p> <p>"Well..." She was quiet for a moment... "I..." She moved closer with his hand to make certain he was looking at her breasts and as she watched it he reached over her to start to fumble with her bra.</p> <p>"Well, well...." He laughed a little as he brought the bra up from under her coat and let her cup fall to the floor, and as he pulled back the hair that had formed there she felt herself flush and a little thrill run up her spine. She wasn't sure what it meant, but as she turned her attention to the boy beside her she suddenly realized that it was making her hot to stare at them and that she was also very self-conscious of the way her breasts had sort of swelled in with arousal. The feeling made her nipples stand at attention and as her eyes moved from his face to his crotch she thought she saw a flash of pinkness in his face and saw an edge in his eyebrow that she hadn't even noticed before.</p> <p>"Are you feeling all right, baby?" He asked, as he moved back to her before she could even answer.</p> <p>"Yes...of course...I mean...yes....I'm just as nervous as you are...." She replied quietly as she watched his face and her own hands began to wander again from his neck, up the back of his shirt, and up the length of his arms until a hand rested lightly on either of the wrists of them, as if trying to reassure him.</p> <p>"Then let's just go, ok? And then you can leave." She took her coat off as she stood up, trying to put everything back in order quickly before she had to go back out and say goodnight and the door wouldn't lock. Her dress had ridden up high by then and before she knew what was happening he was sliding the straps of her bra down over her shoulder and her breasts sprang free, falling in front of him as he reached down to cup them in his hands.</p> <p>She felt him leaning over her, and as she felt his fingertips touch her she turned and saw that he had stopped staring down at her breasts. "Oh, my..." She thought to herself as, at the same time, she realized she was turned on, her nipple sticking straight up in her lap and he was holding her tits in his hands, squeezing them. She found it hard to think of herself as sexy or sexy or sexy, even though she was very turned on and not for the first time she felt the surge of heat between her legs and realized it wasn't just that the man holding her had a big erection. She felt her pussy twitch with excitement as she realized he was staring atâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
