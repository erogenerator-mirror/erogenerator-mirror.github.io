I guess. It was a little tight at first but after I could feel you moving your legs it felt good.</p> <p>"Is it okay to call me Jamie?" I say.</p> <p>"Yeah," she says.</p> <p>"Jamie?" I try again.</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>A part of me wants to take her in my arms again, to hold her just to keep from ruining the mood. But I think she's right. I'm still scared of going down on her.</p> <p>"Do you want to?" I ask.</p> <p>"How can I say no to your tongue Jamie?" she says.</p> <p>"Well," I say, "I could do it but I like it the first time."</p> <p>We kiss for a while, and it feels good to have someone to talk with. My hand moves up her bare stomach to touch her beautiful breasts.</p> <p>"I want to," she says, "I think it's kind of time for me to go."</p> <p>"Okay," I say.</p> <p>I kiss her once more, on top of her lips, and I move down to her neck. She tastes like water. Her skin is salty and smooth, and I can feel her heart beating. I can see her nipples are hard points under her shirt.</p> <p>"Jamie," I whisper, "you're so beautiful."</p> <p>I move down her body again, kissing her collarbone. I slide my hand below the front of her shirt, feeling the skin of her belly. When I reach the waistband of her jogging shorts, she pushes back.</p> <p>"Jamie, can we continue this a little longer?" she whispers. She pulls down her shorts.</p> <p>"I know," I say, "but I'm afraid if you don't move I'm going to lose my confidence too fast."</p> <p>As I slide the back of her panties to the side, her bare bottom comes into view. I move back up to suck her neck, and her hands run through my hair.</p> <p>"Jamie, it's okay if we aren't getting anywhere with this," she says. Her voice is raspy, and I want to move my hands all the way up to her breasts. But I don't. Instead I caress her breasts, the soft flesh of her breasts so soft. I caress the round curves of her ass.</p> <p>"I'm going to stop now," she says. "We shouldn't."</p> <p>I move my hands off her breasts, to the sides of her body. Her hands run all over my body, my head, my arms. She kisses me deeply, her tongue moving along my mouth. I feel her heart pounding, her breathing deep but noisier than mine.</p> <p>It's almost time for me to move to the shower, but I let her push me onto my back. As I lay down beside her, she starts unbuttoning and rubbing my shirt as I lay there. My hands go to her stomach to caress her skin, her skin against my skin.</p> <p>My hand moves on to her chest to caress her nipples, to be petted and touched again. The feeling is incredible. Her hands are so soft, and yet they are very strong as they move all across her, feeling the muscles of her body. I touch her breasts again, the soft flesh of her breasts swelling as they rise and fall. I cup her nipple between thumb and forefinger. I feel her body jerk. I roll my other hand down her flat stomach to feel the hair that grows there, the hair that she keeps for him - the hair that I like. She is shaved, and I can feel the dampness of her sex.</p> <p>It's just what I wanted. I want to be inside of her, to be feeling all of her body. I want to feel every inch of her as I have touched her before. And I want to feel myself inside of her, touching my body on hers.</p> <p>My hand moves up and down her thigh, until it cups her sex. I can feel her heat. I move my hand over her clit, rubbing it as if to make sure I'm careful. I can feel the slickness that she hides. I caress her with two fingers, running from her clit to her opening. Once I feel she's slick, I move my way gently up over her clit, brushing on the surface, making her jump.</p> <p>"Jamie, can we wait for a while?" I say, as if talking to me. I love it when she's afraid that she'll come so quickly. It makes me hot.</p> <p>"No," she cries out. "I mean, that first time we did it, we came together, okay? I need thisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
