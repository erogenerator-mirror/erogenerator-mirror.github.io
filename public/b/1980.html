And it was just to see him so happy, so glad. She leaned in for another kiss on the lips as she knew the kisses of the future. Her eyes closed, her head leaned back onto the pillows and he started off slowly, not wanting it to end. But it was to end, he thought, for she had left out nothing. Her lips parted and she began to kiss him passionately. He pulled away in astonishment that first soft kiss. For a moment, he just stared, shocked as she continued kissing him deeply with lust. Then, his mouth fell open, unable to think about her as his hands held onto her shoulders. But when his lips pressed her more firmly she kissed him faster and more passionately. She moaned loudly against his mouth and her hands began to roam over his chest. He pulled away long enough to look up and she began kissing him as if it was a competition against herself. They both knew the other's body.</p> <p>But they were so different than their bodies did. Whereas her body had a powerful core of energy and all women's body was more fragile. And he couldn't hold it back. Her mouth went wild. She tried to devour his face.</p> <p>"Oh, God..." He finally said. He pulled her up by the shoulder as he pulled her over the side of the bed, laying on top of the sheet. He kissed her hard, his tongue going into her mouth, exploring, tasting, tasting. His hands moved over her body, pulling at her clothing. When she was naked, she lay down next to him on the bed, her head laying on his chest. He took her hand and held it between his lips as he kissed his way down her body. She groaned as he teased her.</p> <p>"I'm afraid." He whispered. She smiled wickedly at him. "That we won't be able to have sex before the end." She said, giving him a devilish look, not unlike a puppy.</p> <p>"We can try, baby." He answered as he continued to tease her. She groaned when she touched his erection as he pulled her down on his lap, taking him into her mouth. Her tongue quickly worked his shaft, drawing out the tip and sucking hard. He felt himself growing even harder while he watched the pleasure on her face.</p> <p>He pulled her up, lying her down on her back on the bed. He began kissing her breasts softly, sucking the hard buds as he stroked his fingers down her body. She pushed her fingers between her legs as his hands found their way to her wet pussy. His tongue was flicking at her pussy as he pulled away from her nipple. She lifted her hips, forcing him closer with her hands that held him firmly between her legs. He leaned down, kissing her passionately as his fingers slid inside of her. Her body had become incredibly slick with desire as his fingers worked their way slowly inside of her. He looked at her face as he thrust in his fingers deeper, feeling her body tremble as his fingers worked their way inside of her. He watched her eyes widen and watched them close as he felt the walls of her pussy clench round his fingers, feeling her muscles contract around them. He slowly pulled them out, feeling her body contract harder around his fingers as he saw the pleasure he had already felt. He couldn't wait for her to come again, he wanted to see her come again even after such a long time together.</p> <p>He continued to stroke inside of her as he rolled her over on her stomach, raising her up on her hands and knees. He moved behind her and kissed his way down her body. He spread her thighs, rubbing his wetness over her back as he kneeled behind her. He slipped inside of her pussy, kissing her back on the way to her ass. She groaned when she felt him penetrate her again, feeling his hard cock filling her completely. She felt empty as he began to stroke into her deeper, moving his hands up her torso and back down her stomach as he thrust into her. Both moaning in pleasure as he kissed her.</p> <p>"Oh, God." She exclaimed in response to the pounding that he continued, pulling against her elbows and moving her legs apart with his own.</p> <p>She felt herself being stretched so tightly and so much that she could feel every ridge and vein on his cock sliding into her body and she knew she had his entire cock inside of her. He began to lift her body up onto his cock, lifting her pussy into the air and fucking her, making her body thrust forward against his. They both moaned, kissing as his hands touched her breasts, squeezing them and pulling them together as he began to drive into her. She could feel his entire cock in her as he began to thrust, filling the inside of her with his thick weapon. He moaned against her ear and she began to tremble.</p> <p>"Do itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
