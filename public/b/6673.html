Her legs began to tremble and she felt her hips begin to buck wildly, making a loud slapping sound, as she fucked harder and then finally she stopped rocking back and forth, not wanting to cum yet.</p> <p>She lay there panting for a few seconds before her eyes fluttered and she sat up, still on a chair. She shook her hair out of her face and sat down, taking her hand in hers and pulling her to stay seated while sitting back again.</p> <p>"Whew, that was amazing, I can't believe this," she said after breathing through her nose.</p> <p>Linda smiled, and then she told her, "Yeah and that was the best massage I've ever had!"</p> <p>She sat up, looking at her legs, and then told her, "Well go ahead and try. I do that every day and really, there's nothing like the feel of massaging a woman's legs!"</p> <p>Linda nodded her head then she got to work. She massaged each of her feet, pulling and twisting them, rubbing the heels, moving up the back of both calves, and over the tops of her thighs.</p> <p>She moved up to her thighs, slowly and deeply, making sure to rub and rub the soft flesh as she moved. Her legs trembled as she slid her hands up the back of her legs, massaging the firm flesh of her legs, moving up, around, and over her inner thighs, as she kept her eyes looking forward.</p> <p>With each pass of her hands over her legs, her eyes closed, and she let out a moan of pleasure as she felt her womanhood getting wetter and wetter.</p> <p>Linda rolled over on her back, moving her legs so that she was lying on her back again. She could feel a warmth beginning to fill her and she opened her eyes. The glow from the TV set, the glow of her bedside clock, the glow of her phone and the reflection of the ceiling light shining through the window, made her eyes even more wet, the lustful desire to go get herself off.</p> <p>Linda looked down at herself, and then looked at her body as it turned to lay flat on the bed. She could see the sweat beads glistening on her body as her head was turned toward her.</p> <p>Linda's breasts heaved as she sat up straight, and her nipples had become stiff, and they were hard sticking out, protruding straight out from the thin top of her breasts. She pulled her dress down, covering her breasts, and then she rolled onto her side slightly, away from the lamp light, which was shining through her window. Linda's fingers slowly traced their way to her breast, cupping and fondling her breast gently and gently pulling on the tender flesh.</p> <p>Linda's stomach quivered as she ran her fingers over the hardened nipples, squeezing, gently squeezing. Her fingers tweaked and rolled her nipples, rolling them in her fingers, pinching and pulling.</p> <p>After a few moments, her fingers began to stroke the breast that she had been looking at for all that time. Her hand slowly rubbed up and down her breast, squeezing the nipple between her fingers. Her free hand ran down her stomach until it came to rest on her mound. Linda felt one part of her body stiffen as she cupped and massaged her sex and pushed the lower end of her fingers between her lips with her other hand, rubbing the outer lips against her inner pussy lips.</p> <p>Linda closed her eyes and her hips began to sway, humping her crotch upwards against her fingers. Her breathing was getting faster, harder and she began to pant faster as her pleasure built. She let out a loud moan, "Oh god baby! That feels so good!"</p> <p>It was then that her hips came out of control, shaking and quivering, her eyes half rolled back and locking them onto the reflection of the ceiling light shining through her window. Linda continued to pinch and pull on her breasts, twisting each of her nipples at the same time, which made her thighs clench together uncontrollably, and her entire body shiver.</p> <p>All of a sudden her back clenched and she let out a howl. "OHH, I'M COMING!" she howled, then her eyes fluttered open and she looked into her own. Her mouth hung open as she stared at her chest. She looked up at the ceiling and stared back at her.</p> <p>"OHH wow! You are so hot! I can't believe I had not heard that first," she said with a laugh, looking down at herself. "That was incredible," she said in a whisper, running her fingers through her hair to her face, and then she looked off into the distance. "Now let's go do something about this."</p> <p>Her hips swayed once and then sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
