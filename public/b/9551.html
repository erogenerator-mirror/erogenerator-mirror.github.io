He put his head down on the cushion.</p> <p>"You got it, it's over with now." Gianne stood beside him. She was standing at the doorway, looking out.</p> <p>"What are you doing here?" she asked.</p> <p>"Well, there's no place, anyway."</p> <p>"It's okay, the others have left, I'll be in my bedroom."</p> <p>With that she left and closed his door.</p> <p>Gianne was not going to be happy with this, but at least it had a good ending; it was the beginning of more.</p> <p>Gianne was alone in the house. She did not see Brian, so she went upstairs to find him in the study. She stood before the door, listening to him talk to her.</p> <p>"My mother has never liked me."</p> <p>She nodded. Why couldn't Brian stay? He could get away with it.</p> <p>"Well, it is not that easy, I want someone else. I don't want you to leave."</p> <p>"I'd prefer Brian, I won't tell them, and I wouldn't want to start it with a kiss."</p> <p>She was looking down at the floor. She felt bad about going to that man's room with him on her, but she wanted to. She wanted to stay with him forever.</p> <p>She got very mad at him, she wasn't going to let him make her feel like that again and she had to learn how to control her temper. It might not be fun if he kept putting her at ease, it seemed like everything he did to her was a mistake after all.</p> <p>She closed his door, turned on the lights and turned off the light.</p> <p>"Brian, get up and go, the first one upstairs has already left."</p> <p>"I don't think so."</p> <p>"I won't hurt you, just do whatever you have to do. Don't be late!"</p> <p>She closed and locked his door again.</p> <p>"I need you by my side now and I don't want to leave now. Just stay with me tonight!"</p> <p>She pulled him on her bed and they both kissed, just a couple of minutes. He felt her hands sliding up and down his buttock, slowly moving toward the top of his thigh. He felt her hand reach the top of his thigh, just as her hand closed around his hard cock.</p> <p>Before he had a chance to say anything, she took it as a yes and kissed him again.</p> <p>He pulled her onto him and pushed down on her shoulders. She sat on his legs.</p> <p>"What's going on?"</p> <p>"The guys are all gone, I told you it would be okay."</p> <p>She did not move, she wanted to stop this, to find out if Brian was still there.</p> <p>"You did this, it's okay."</p> <p>"What do you mean it's okay, it's okay?"</p> <p>"Okay so long as you don't get aroused."</p> <p>"No, okay, but what is going on?"</p> <p>"There has to be something between us."</p> <p>He felt her lips press against him, kiss a bit more then his cock got hard in her hand.</p> <p>"Just wait and find out," he said then turned to face her.</p> <p>He laid her back on his bed facing the head of the bed. He knelt, his cock at her face, kissed her. He pulled off her clothes, he undressed down to her panties.</p> <p>He climbed between her legs and kissed and teased his tongue up and down her slit, over her clit, then down the lips of her vagina. He kissed and licked then moved up and pushed between her legs. He moved his penis and rubbed up and down as he moved up and down.</p> <p>He moved up and down several times each time, feeling his penis move into her. He moved up and down again, he watched the lips of her vagina, his penis move in and out of her. His penis moved up again. He moved up and down several times a second time. His penis moved up and down a few times also.</p> <p>He moved up close to her face and put his penis between her lips. He moved on it a few more times then moved down to her vagina and positioned his hard penis so he could enter her. He held his penis at that opening as he pushed up.</p> <p>His penis rubbed on her clit as he pushed up and down but did not slide into her. He just stood with his legs apart as he moved up and down, his penis moving between her lips, his penis rubbing up and down her clit. He didn't know how much of him he was touching.
