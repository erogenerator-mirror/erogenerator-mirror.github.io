They were at each others feet. There was mutual admiration; the mutual attraction was evident. Her hand was between them, rubbing his penis. His hand was on her breast now. His hand had reached under her nightshirt and it felt good to him. He rubbed himself against her naked thigh as she moved a leg on his thigh.</p> <p>She felt a shiver run down her spine. He was stroking her pussy through her panties.</p> <p>"Turn around, baby." He whispered and she turned around to face him. She reached up to caress his face and kissed him. He pulled her close and they kissed passionately.</p> <p>His hands had found their way up her legs and he lifted her nightshirt up to see her small waist. He cupped her breasts, feeling the nipples poke through the soft white cotton of her panties. A shiver ran down her spine again and this time it wasn't a shiver of disgust.</p> <p>"Oh fuck yeah!" He said, lifting her up and carrying her to his bed. By the time they got to it he was nude. She felt him laying her down and looking around for a clock. He had laid his cock there and had found the one. He turned on the light and looked at her. It startled her at first. It was a good look. She felt a warm rush in her pussy and her nipples hardened.</p> <p>"It doesn't work this way," She said. He laughed, but it caused a jolt deep in her pussy.</p> <p>"It is easier without getting hurt." She said, her eyes sparkling. "You feel wonderful," He said in a low voice. He kissed her lips, his arms going around her body. "I haven't had a cock since that morning," She said, looking at the big blue cock that she now felt. It pulsed in his hand, the size of it was still impressive. The head was big, at least seven inches long and the thick veiny stem that extended to the big round eye that she now felt against her mound. It pulsed in her hand, his hand. Her hand moved up and down, feeling the big cock, now erect.</p> <p>"I don't think it's gonna fit," she said, but she couldn't control it any longer. He was in her before she knew what was happening. He was pulling her panties off. "You're all I think will fit," She moaned and felt him reach under her body. She felt his fingers against her pussy lips.</p> <p>"What do you say we try?" He asked. He had pulled off his shorts and shorts and was lying on the bed. Her legs fell apart and she felt him touch her. She felt his fingers, sliding gently around her lips and caressing the sensitive area within. She wanted him to go slowly. But she knew he always wanted to take her slowly. She felt the lips open under his fingers and he stroked the area, making her pussy twitch. She moved her legs closer together.</p> <p>"Do that again," she said, "but this time on your cock,"</p> <p>She felt him spread her open, his fingers reaching down, finding the tip. He stroked that little fleshy tip and slid his middle two fingers deep into her. Her body shook on his finger.</p> <p>"Oh! I'm gonna cum right now!" She moaned, the feeling of his fingers moving in and pushing against her was so intense. His fingers went in her for a while, getting her wet, then moved around and then out of her. Both his hands still held her legs open.</p> <p>"That was great!" He said, his voice filled with admiration and satisfaction. "But what's next?" He got up, took of his shorts and pulled out his cock. "You have to suck me first," he said.</p> <p>"That's right but I thought I could do this with my mouth."</p> <p>"Well, you have to let me go first."</p> <p>She leaned forward and lowered her mouth onto the swollen head of his cock. The smooth head filled her mouth. She started licking and sucking him, feeling the velvety texture underneath.</p> <p>"Oooh!" He said. "You're a good cocksucker baby!" He pulled his cock out of her mouth. She had tasted his precum a couple of times but never anything that was that good. But he didn't seem to mind that she was a virgin.</p> <p>"You can take it all in your mouth and work you tongue over my head. It feels fucking fantastic." She felt him lay back. She could see his cock pointing up. She moved her mouth down on him, feeling his fat knob in her mouth. One hand went down to play with his balls. She felt him spread her lips open, watching them rollâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
