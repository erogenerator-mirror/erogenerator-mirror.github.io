Once my breasts were free, his hands went to her dress, unzipping it as I lifted off my sandals, and gently lifted her out of them. Reaching over to my blouse, I slipped it off my shoulders and he stood again, leaning forward and brushing his lips over my nipples, before running his fingers up my sides and pulling her dress higher, exposing the lace of her panties, before lifting my skirt up over her hips.</p> <p>His hands dropped to her knees, undoing the ties, slipping out of her panties. He pushed her down onto the bench again with both hands, looking up to see my expression, biting my lip as he slid me back over the side. "I'm getting warm!" he said, pulling her panties down over her hips to the floor, his gaze never leaving her body as I stood, letting him slide his hands over her. My heart was pounding in my chest now as I watched his hands, his eyes. As he slowly, very slowly slid my panties down over my hips.</p> <p>He leaned down and, as she sat down on the bench again, his lips met mine, his hands slowly slipping into the top of my jeans. He pulled me into him again for another kiss, our tongues battling briefly as he slid his hands over my butt, pulling me tighter to him as his hands slid up the inside of my thighs, slipping under the elastic of her panties to slip along the lips of her pussy. My face was flushed with passion my body was shamed, as I felt one of his fingers slip into my pussy and my body jerked and my body tensed up as I felt him begin to move his finger in and out of me as we kissed.</p> <p>"Aaaaah!" I groaned as his hands cupped my ass in soft, wet little motions, pulling me in tight against him as I felt one finger slip inside me and my body jerked again.</p> <p>He pressed one of his hands firmly on the small of the back of my upper back as he slid one of his own between us, pressing his thumb against my asshole. I leaned back against him, his finger sliding all around inside me while I pushed against him, my whole body shaking with pleasure. Then, I felt his cock press against me, against my stomach as his fingers continued to slip inside me.</p> <p>"Oh GOD! Oh GOD!" I cried out as his hand moved inside of me, his thumb working my sphincter as my pussy felt him slide inside of me, rubbing up and down around his cock in waves of pleasure. His finger sliding inside me, rubbing up and down my ass as he kissed me all over. I felt like I was on fire as I watched him slide his cock inside me, pushing it into me as I reached up to grasp his ass, pulling him inside of me. His hips pressed against me as he pushed his cock a little deeper inside, as his thumb rubbed back and forth in small circles on my ass as it slid up and down my pussy.</p> <p>"That's how I liked you!" he said with his head on my shoulder, his eyes watching me, as one of his hands rose up and pressed my breasts into his chest, holding them there as he slid the rest of his cock back inside of me, his fingers working my ass as he kissed my neck. "That's how I'm going to do it."</p> <p>And he fucked me more, our bodies, as we looked at each other. And I felt like my body was spinning, feeling like I was being fucked. But I felt like I could cum just from that one look in his eyes. And his mouth hung on mine, as his hips thrust against me, pushing his cock into me again and again as his fingers worked my asshole.</p> <p>"You're so goddamn tight," he whispered against my lips, as he slid his hands up my back to undo my bra. Then, he lifted himself off of the bench again. "Come on, baby!" he said with mock sternness, as he pulled my hand to his pants buckle, undoing the button and pulling it out of his pocket.</p> <p>"No, wait for me!" I cried, as my hand reached for him, holding him against me. He stepped forward, kissing me urgently. He pushed his way between my legs, grabbing my ankles and sliding them up my calves. My legs spread wide open, letting him slide me up the bench again, as his hands went over my knees.</p> <p>"Please, John-baby!" I begged him as I felt his cock pressed against my slitâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
