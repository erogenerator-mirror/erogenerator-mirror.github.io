The man held the door wide for the stranger to enter the shop and, as they passed the large window and through the door in the back it was obvious they were in the back of the shop looking at stock of lingerie and shoes. However, before they had entered or had locked the door the man pulled the woman through and out through the back exit and into the darkness of the shop.</p> <p>They both sat in the car, the stranger looking at the woman.</p> <p>'So how did you like to come on holiday without having any fun at all.'</p> <p>'I don't know that I wanted to, but when I did it was all I could do to keep from laughing too hard.'</p> <p>'I can understand how. You looked after yourself the best you could and it made it easy for you to take your dress off completely to make things easier.'</p> <p>'I enjoyed it too.'</p> <p>The stranger laughed.</p> <p>'But what about tonight? I saw this number on the back.'</p> <p>"Oh! My! And I hope this is the number you like.'</p> <p>They looked at the number.</p> <p>'Yes, it's not too late.'</p> <p>'Well let me buy it.'</p> <p>The two men in the back seat looked at each other and laughed again.</p> <p>After about ten minutes of staring they looked at the number and laughed again.</p> <p>The gentleman at the next stop turned up.</p> <p>'Do you mean it?'</p> <p>As I said it would be the first time they'd ever heard from an old relative so they wanted to know what it was called.</p> <p>'It's not very exciting.'</p> <p>'Oh! Very exciting.'</p> <p>They looked at each other again.</p> <p>'We have to have a little laugh at the thought of all we've talked about on the way to the hotel for more than a week now.'</p> <p>As soon as they had said that they had to be quick. The last stop, at the hotel gave them a good few minutes of alone time and they sat looking at each other.</p> <p>'Well do you like it?'</p> <p>'Yes.'</p> <p>'Are you sure?'</p> <p>'Yes, it's so very exciting, I do want to try that out more'</p> <p>'I'm sure I could arrange it for you, but you know I would probably get in trouble for this.'</p> <p>The man at the next stop smiled but laughed.</p> <p>'Of course I know that, it's a very exciting place.'</p> <p>As they had reached the hotel after a couple of hours there were a couple of taxi's waiting and they got out of the car.</p> <p>'This is an interesting car,' the man said. 'Come on I'll get you a key.'</p> <p>'Thank you, it would be great to have a bit of fun with it.'</p> <p>'Good to see you again,' he said as he took her arm.</p> <p>As he pulled away he asked for the hotel.</p> <p>'Oh yes, it's on the ground floor right here.'</p> <p>She had been able to get into the lift and was once again amazed at the price.</p> <p>They had bought their first two cases and both were inside.</p> <p>'You don't look like you're about to burst into a room with two cases already filled.'</p> <p>'It wouldn't be difficult if I didn't want to have to take the bag myself,' she said looking at the two cases that they had opened. 'Please have a look.'</p> <p>The man pointed to one of the cases.</p> <p>"The toilet is inside the first case, please try it first."</p> <p>The woman looked at the bed and said.</p> <p>'It's a bit messy.'</p> <p>"There's plenty of room and I want to take a quick shower, and wash my body thoroughly. I'll be ready shortly.'</p> <p>He opened the door for her to get out.</p> <p>As soon as she was out he turned and said to the men behind him.</p> <p>"No go in first. They've got towels so they won't get dirty."</p> <p>'No, no it's so dirty for me. I want to go back in in the morning.'</p> <p>It was obvious he didn't understand why.</p> <p>He was walking her back to her car and pulling her hand to his shoulder.</p> <p>'So let me get this, it's my first holiday in fifteen years. I can't wait to see you again.'</p> <p>'Let me open the door then,' she said as she opened the door for himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
