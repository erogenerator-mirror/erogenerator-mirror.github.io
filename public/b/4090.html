"Let's see where she goes with it. Here, have a seat down here next to her. My, this is a hot tub. I think we have room for one more, just relax and let her do her thing."</p> <p>We got settled on the patio and took in the sunset over the lake. We then decided on a couple of chaises that I was sure would look really nice on this night.</p> <p>Jenny had put candles in the spa earlier and had lit a fire. Now, we did it just to make us comfortable. The water bubbled and glistened as it slid in. The jets, while cool, felt heavenly on our tired bodies.</p> <p>"This is a little kilt," I said as I placed the towel on the lounge and sat up. "Can we go in and get some more champagne? Is there any more at the house?"</p> <p>"Yes. I'll go get it for you." He answered as he stood.</p> <p>"Thanks. I am tired too." Then he smiled at me. "Can I go freshen up?"</p> <p>"You can't go anywhere. Your hot tub is very private, so don't ask. When I got out your water is almost back to normal. We won't be in here long before we get into something." I said as I turned back towards the house.</p> <p>Jenny came in just in time. She had not worn anything under the gown that she had on earlier. Her breasts were small, but perfect for her body. Her nipples were pointing out at us in all their beauty as they were hardening immediately. Her eyes never left mine as she looked the water and me up and down.</p> <p>"Oh shit," she said. "You look just a little..."</p> <p>"Not as good as my sister. You might want to go freshen up a little. You look a little like your sister." I said as I pulled her in for a kiss.</p> <p>I then kissed her deeply and started to massage her breasts. She responded with equal passion as she started to kiss me too. We embraced tightly for several seconds. The water was cool but not uncomfortable. Her breasts were pressed against my chest, and her ass was firmly planted against my hardening cock.</p> <p>Jenny broke our embrace and turned towards me. There was a long lingering kiss before we parted.</p> <p>"Have a seat with your back against the door." I said as I set the pitcher in a basin and handed her a bottle of red wine. She sipped for a brief moment and then turned and left the house. It was time to enjoy ourselves, before we had to get back to our room. I stood and poured the wine and handed her another glass. She took it and set it on the night stand. Her body glistened as she did so. I handed her another glass and she took hers and set it on the ledge. Her nipples were still erect. I watched intently as she sipped a second glass. Her legs were well-defined and I got an immediate erection. We finished our wine and took a quick look around. We were just about to turn off the lights when I saw our neighbor's head appear at the window just a second after Jenny and I had kissed. It was very difficult to tell where it might have been, but she appeared intent on looking at us. We got up and went back into the house to change. As I was about to leave, Jenny came back from the back bathroom with a second bottle. She stood in front of me and smiled at me.</p> <p>"Wow. That was hot!"</p> <p>She took her wine from me and set it down on the floor with her bare foot. She took my hand and stood in front of me. She was just inches away.</p> <p>"I need you in my embrace, right here, right now." She said as she pulled me back into a deep kiss.</p> <p>She backed away and turned the doorknob. I quickly found my spot while she was working the doorknob. She was standing with her back to me and started to undo my shirt. Then she quickly undid my pants and pulled them down. I kicked them off as she tossed my pants into the room to join hers. When she was done, she went to work on my belt. She loosened my pants and started to take off my shirt. I sat back down and just sat there, allowing her to get my shirt and my pants off. As she finished stripping my pants off, she tossed them into the floor to join her clothes. When the clothing was off, she went to start on my shoes, which she took off first. While she pulled my shoes off, I slid my hands all over her body. Her skin was warm and soft. My caresses, while gentle and loving, were sensâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
