It was the first time she had not looked directly into his eyes before. She had hoped that she could break the trance, but she kept returning her gaze to the deep blue water. He looked like he was going to say something, so she said softly.</p> <p>"I don't have a bathing suit."</p> <p>She wasn't sure if he meant to laugh or cry or something. But, he looked so happy and happy and happy that she almost felt sad.</p> <p>"I don't think I've ever seen you more relaxed and happy in my life" he said.</p> <p>She felt that she was already falling in love.</p> <p>"I don't know, but I haven't been this tired or this stressed. I've just been so happy. I haven't felt this happy in a long time, either."</p> <p>"I've got to run. There's some water right there."</p> <p>"OK."</p> <p>She got up and quickly grabbed her purse and dried off her hair. She put on a t-shirt and her gym shorts. She went to the shower. She pulled the water jet up from the floor. She grabbed a small bottle, squeezed some conditioner on her hands and began massaging her scalp.</p> <p>She was just getting down when she heard him.</p> <p>"C'mon." He said holding out his hands for her to grasp.</p> <p>She grabbed his hands and they slid over her shoulders. She felt the water flowing off her back and down her legs.</p> <p>He reached around and took hold of her tits. They were still firm and large. He was massaging and squeezing her nipples between his fingers.</p> <p>She closed her eyes and leaned back against him. She could feel his chest pressed against her back. She moaned just a fraction of a second into his mouth. He reached with his free hand and rubbed the back of her leg. He moved his hand up to her ass and began sliding it up and down the back of her leg. She shuddered just a bit as if a current passed between her legs.</p> <p>He continued to slide up her leg, taking short breaths into her neck. He pulled her tank top off over her head and tossed it toward a nearby towel. He started massaging her stomach, making her stomach rumbling to her. He could feel her breath on his neck as he did. She turned and kissed him full on the mouth. He felt her tongue slide into his mouth and into his mouth, almost as if she was sucking on it. His hands slid all the way up to her tits and squeezed them as they bounced up and down. They felt great and he wanted them to remain there. She felt them and squeezed them harder. Her nipples were hard and pointed straight toward the ceiling. He pulled her back against his body and he could feel the weight of her breasts against his chest. He pushed his hips up against her as he continued to kiss her.</p> <p>He was so fucking horny that he didn't care that he was kissing his sister and fucking his own brains out with her hot body. He was about to blow when she said into his ear.</p> <p>"It's ok. You can just go. It's not going to hurt."</p> <p>She grabbed his hand and put it between her legs, sliding his finger into her wet pussy. He pushed it in and out of her.</p> <p>She moaned a little louder as he slowly finger fucked her. They had to hold each other tighter against each other. He was so turned on.</p> <p>He kissed her ear and neck as he pulled out, he felt her body tremble again. He turned her around and kissed her hard on the mouth. He could taste the salt of her breath and the sweetness of her body.</p> <p>She pulled away from his lips and he looked over his shoulder at her. She was laying on the towels and was completely naked. Her body was flushed. She looked so angelic in that state. He thought about telling her not to cover herself up, but that wouldn't have been any real explanation, right? And he also thought about her saying "no". He was a guy, but, he was thinking about making love to her all this time, not just making love to her. He looked over her shoulder at him and smiled. He ran his hand lightly down her back. His finger found its way to the crack of her ass. He slid his finger under it and onto the top of her crack. He slid his finger along her slit. His finger slid inside her. She shivered once as he fucked her with his finger.</p> <p>He took his finger out. He rubbed the back of her hand against his cock. He wanted to fuck her.
