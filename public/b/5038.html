"The thing is, we really never have really talked about it before."</p> <p>I don't have a clue why, but it felt good to have her tell me all about it! "Ok, I guess it's just a little different to just think what we can do as a couple, right? I mean, as a couple."</p> <p>"Oh well, we've gotta keep in mind you've already had quite a few partners," Emily declared. "But that's just between me and you, okay? You don't know me, and neither of us will know you. And, if you're worried, maybe I won't tell you this, that would be cool, right?"</p> <p>"Just remember, I have a nice, hot and wet pussy, even if your not into oral, so don't feel bad..."</p> <p>"Right, I know, but I just wish I'd been more open to it a little more," Emily agreed, but then stopped.</p> <p>We had talked about it a little more, had both admitted the truth that we were pretty open with our bodies, that we enjoyed each other's bodies, and that we'd even have sex with each other. It was something that came naturally to both of us, and after a few short weeks, our mutual attraction for each other had strengthened. I had wanted to talk a little more, find out if it felt the same as if everything else we experienced, what each of us liked, if we really loved each other. We talked a little more, and it got easier for me to talk, though it would have taken me a long time to do so.</p> <p>Emily was the first to come forward, sitting next to me, her hand resting gently on my thigh as she said: "I know you love me, and I do mean love me. I know it's been hard for you lately, that it's been hard for us too."</p> <p>I looked down with a frown: "How? Are you sure you won't mind if I tell you it's complicated?" My tone was more serious than I was expecting.</p> <p>"No, I don't mind at all," Emily reassured.</p> <p>"Then," I paused, still holding my eyes with my gaze, "it doesn't have to be really complicated. You know I am very attracted to you, don't you?"</p> <p>"How do you know that?" she asked, with a slightly mischievous smile on her face.</p> <p>"Honestly," I shrugged, knowing she was teasing. "It's really not that complicated."</p> <p>Emily reached over and placed a hand on mine. "Don't make us feel we don't understand."</p> <p>"Well, I don't know about that," I countered.</p> <p>I looked her in the eye and gave her hand a little shake. "Okay, I'm sure we don't have any problems with that either." She grinned back, and then gently rubbed my knee. "Just give me a chance. Don't think we'll have anything to worry about."</p> <p>Emily reached across my lap, but stopped just before she took my cock into her hand and squeezed it gently. "I'd even consider having a little fun with you in just a few minutes if you don't mind that I'm doing that," she added.</p> <p>It felt kind of naughty, especially as my cock was starting to feel a little stiffer. "That would be nice," I replied honestly.</p> <p>Emily slowly started to rock her hips against my thigh, grinding her pelvis against my leg as she spoke softly in my ear: "I want you to feel good so you can really focus on the sensations... I know how to make a woman feel good," she whispered, as she reached under the towel to rub my stiff cock on her lower abdomen.</p> <p>"Ok, I'm sure it's not that complicated," I acknowledged as I reached around her body with my free hand and put my fingers on her nipple, rolling it between them. "But I don't know about being focused."</p> <p>Emily gave me a half smile, and then started gently rubbing her own nipples with the tips of her fingers as she asked: "Can you just get it up?"</p> <p>"Yeah," I answered as I reached down to stroke my shaft. "Just rub the head a little. I'll get you to do that."</p> <p>Emily leaned closer as she placed her fingers on my upper thigh, pressing her naked breasts against my leg as she said: "I don't think I even need to be touched to know I feel good. You are so much manhood. I guess it's just natural to have a man respond to your body."</p> <p>I reached up with my free hand and cupped her left breast.
