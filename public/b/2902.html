As for you two, you just let me know tomorrow when you're free, we can do whatever it is. Just be careful you don't fall down and scratch something. You two make a good business man."</p> <p>With that I turned and started to turn my back on her, just barely, when the door swung open and we were locked in a tight embrace. I could feel her nipples pressing hard into mine, which gave me the excuse it took to pull her towards me and start kissing her harder. She felt good against me, her breasts were a wonderful full C cup and didn't need any support, even if she had her dress down around the tops of her legs, her bare tummy had a smooth tan and she was looking absolutely adorable, but it was a shame it was me who was kissing her all the way round the front of her lips.</p> <p>I pulled back gently, my breath quickened just a little at the thought of what lay ahead if she didn't take it this time. There was no point in breaking the mood, so I got back down on my knees next to the bed, kissing my way up her belly to her soft lips that were slightly parted. I could smell her cologne and the sweet, intoxicating scent of her sex, making my dick so hard it almost hurt.</p> <p>I put my arms around her and began kissing the side of her neck. She shivered a little as I worked my way up to those perky tits, kissing her hard on the mouth as my hands wandered over her ribs, kneading her breasts and occasionally sliding up to her neck. She opened her mouth as I slowly kissed my way to her nipples that were sticking out as they pressed together. She grabbed a hold of my head and pushed it upwards till her lips met mine. I kissed her passionately, moving my tongue back and forth between hers. She was so wet and I could feel her getting wetter. I had no intention of taking a break now, but just like with earlier, I got the idea that just to make sure she wasn't taking the opportunity again, I'd give her my cock.</p> <p>I pulled back and let her drop down onto her back. She gave a giggle, "Are you sure you were just joking around with me," she asked with a smile.</p> <p>"It's a good thing I'm not sure you're a liar that's for sure," I smiled, as I started to slowly take off her clothes. She lay there in all her glory, her eyes closed as I undressed her. I looked into those sexy eyes, full of lust, "I'm gonna really enjoy every bit of this!"</p> <p>"Oh you can't fuck your wife again," she pouted with a laugh.</p> <p>"Maybe a bit, besides I feel the same way, so don't you go asking me to fuck her any time soon."</p> <p>"You're not my wife again," she pouted again, "I was only hoping you wouldn't go after her in the way you did before!"</p> <p>"Maybe a bit?" I said winking.</p> <p>"Maybe so, but I know what it feels like when you want them," she said with a smile, her tongue darting around her lips as she looked down at me to see what I was doing.</p> <p>I started playing with her breasts as I pulled her dress down off of her body, I slipped it off and moved down to her panties, she lifted her pelvis up as I slipped them off her legs and flung them across the room. Her feet fell towards the window, where she was trying to kick the door. I slid them off and put them towards her legs, watching closely as she got up from the bed, her legs looked beautiful, her thighs tight, her stomach looking inviting. I looked down at myself, the sight only a few inches from my wife's naked body was enough to make me go stiff between my legs, a fact I could hide when I started to stroke.</p> <p>I knew it wouldn't last long and hoped that I could maintain eye to eye contact with her without having her knowing it, my free hand moving down over her abdomen to her vagina. She parted my thighs slightly as it lay there, my fingers moving towards her and opening her. Her body was amazing. I couldn't believe her size. Her breasts sat up right, her stomach was tight, and her pussy was beautiful. I had always heard men were so proud of their dick sizes, and now I'd heard that women were more jealous and more curious about what a man's penis size was. I'd seen some men'sâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
