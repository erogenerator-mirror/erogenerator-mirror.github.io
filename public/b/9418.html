I was starting to feel the pain of losing her and her children.</p> <p>"There isn't enough room on the bed," I said. "I'd better make sure we don't run out!"</p> <p>"No, please!" she objected. "Don't do this!" In the kitchen she started to get dressed.</p> <p>"If you really don't want to go through that again, you're gonna have to go with me," I said.</p> <p>"Let's go!" Sarah called from the kitchen.</p> <p>When she returned with the clothing Sarah had brought I was already dressed. Sarah looked at me. I took her in my arms. "I'm sorry," she sobbed. I held her body as she sobbed. I was crying myself and felt I would never forgive her. It took a tremendous strength of will to hold her for ever.</p> <p>I pulled back and looked at her face. "I'll be back, Sarah. I'll have dinner in the hotel at 8:00 tonight if you don't want me to keep you!" And then I went back outside, got into my car and drove away.</p> <p>As I drove out of the kitchen, I was crying, but I couldn't let her go. I felt that I had to do it but I needed to do it and I didn't want to scare her. Then we were gone. And I went for a long time, holding her for dear life and crying out her name.</p> <p>I know it looks strange but I really wanted Sarah to be my wife. My life was all but complete and I didn't care. I had my children and my grandchildren. I didn't care who they were to me.</p> <p>When I got home, Sarah was already there waiting for me. She looked at me with a look of despair. "I don't understand," she whispered. It was clear to me that she felt the same thing that I did.</p> <p>"I have to be married," I said, "I have to keep loving you!"</p> <p>I held her with my arms around her. "I love you," I sobbed, "I don't think this is the right time for us." She started to cry again and I moved to her and we both were crying.</p> <p>Sarah put her hands on my face and I held her body against mine. "I want to say goodbye," she replied, "but I have to go back now! It is too late!"</p> <p>When she broke free we hugged and I looked at her.</p> <p>"It's too late," I said. "I'm going home to my folks!"</p> <p>She broke free of my arms and we stood hugging each other. Then she spoke. "I love you!"</p> <p>I held her to me and we kissed and cried. Afterwards we just held each other. I held her the whole way back.</p> <p>"Why do you always say that to me?" she asked.</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"Why couldn't I tell you what I thought that you wanted?"</p> <p>I thought for a long time. "I thought that you did," I said. "What did you want?"</p> <p></p> <p>Chapter Two</p> <p>We have been married for 10 years and now it's just after a three day weekend trip to a nearby state park. I had been trying to make it happen and now my darling Sarah and I were in the midst of a plan of action.</p> <p>The first night we were there, I dropped the children off at a friends house to take them to dinner. I had been hoping that their mother had left Sarah behind for a while. Of course, they were both a little confused at the time. It was the first time she had gone without an escort. She had gone straight home.</p> <p>Then I told her about the three day trip to Europe. She was confused but there was nothing I didn't agree with. It was after that night that we got together in the way that we would have had intercourse. There didn't seem to be a rational logic to our actions. We never took the decision for ourselves. The idea of her going without a boyfriend didn't seem practical. Even when I talked about it to her, she seemed confused. It was always after we had talked about such things that there began to a connection between us. I thought that it was obvious to her that we had a relationship, a sort of a platonic one, but I think that was a sign of something else.</p> <p>I had a chance to be alone, so I went to bed at 7:00 a.m.</p> <p>Chapter Three</p> <p>A week after we got married, I took Sarah with me again. There were only a couple nights left in our six month marriage.
