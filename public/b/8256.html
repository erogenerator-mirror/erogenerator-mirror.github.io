Her eyes were locked onto mine as she continued. "I wish his hips could feel the same way. He is so sexy and hot. I can't wait to go home and lie here with his cum leaking down all over my thighs, when he cums."</p> <p>I felt my own orgasm rising within me, ready to explode. "I sure hope not tonight. I've really had too much to eat."</p> <p>"Oh, you know, I think I might make an exception tonight, if I promise to keep my promise."</p> <p>With that we both fell on the bed, and we slept.</p> <p>**************</p> <p>I have no idea how I began it was about 15 years ago. I'm not really sure how I met Julie. As it turned out, I was in a hotel a few hours away from the office. I got home just before 1:00 pm and was having some wine while waiting for my wife. She was dressed in a gray blouse and tan pants, and was at one of the chairs near the fire place. She was sitting with me while we were eating pizza. I had never been into having sex with another woman, but Julie had never been the type to object. For the sake of our marriage, or as it might be, we continued to live at home and enjoy our own sex lives.</p> <p>The conversation was minimal for the majority of us, and my wife occasionally caught our eye. I don't think her eyes could have been more obvious, and if there wasn't a smattering, I would have felt guilty about it. Her presence was not lost on me, and the last thing I said was, "Let's just wait for tonight."</p> <p>We were still eating and talking when we saw a black Mercedes pull in the drive.</p> <p>"What the hell is this?" my wife demanded to know.</p> <p>I tried to pull myself together and say, "I asked where I could find a taxi."</p> <p>As both of us finished eating, Julie said, "If it's so important to you, you're still welcome to stay a while. I'll even pay." She got up and left shortly thereafter.</p> <p>She sat down next to me and kissed me. "I would have had to go through all this again tonight if I hadn't been waiting." She giggled.</p> <p>"Oh, you're just being cruel."</p> <p>We continued like that for hours, kissing, fondling, eating, talking, and occasionally getting a little naughty. It was a wonderful first meeting.</p> <p>************</p> <p>My wife had a surprise for me that evening.</p> <p>For the next two years, Julie would go out to dinner, sometimes dancing with customers. My husband is a good cook, and Julie would come over late at night, while I stayed in for the evening, and watched a movie. Our sex life was still good, but we still enjoyed good sex, and we always had a great time whenever we did.</p> <p>I never saw Julie again, but in the meantime, my wife was coming to visit a few of her friends. They were all in town for the weekend, and they could use a break. During this time, I had not fucked a woman in over five years, only one, and I had not been able to come close to doing that.</p> <p>Julie was in town for a few weeks then. It seemed a few times each week.</p> <p>I would say that Julie was a beautiful woman. She was 5'3 and was fairly thin, standing about 110 pounds. Her breasts were big, and very prominent, if you asked me, but I just couldn't put my finger on them. She had long brown hair that was a bit past shoulder length. She had short brown hair that usually covered her shoulders and back. Her ass always looked so great, and although I could never really see it naked, I could imagine it was nicely displayed.</p> <p>My wife wasn't as stunningly beautiful as my wife, but she was very pretty and I could imagine that she would be just perfect, and I wanted her that way. She was also very friendly with other men, and was a real turn on for me. On weekends, however, I would just let the guys talk me into stopping at their house after work, and not to be there when they came straight to her house.</p> <p>One day Julie came over to my house, and I invited myself over to go for a beer.</p> <p>Julie had gone back to her friends and had a few drinks, when she saw me sitting on my porch with a beer in my hand.</p> <p>"Hi, Jim" she smiled at me, "I wanted to ask you something."</p> <p>My wife was already in the kitchen, and I had a chanceâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
