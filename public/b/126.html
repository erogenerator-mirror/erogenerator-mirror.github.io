I smiled at her and leaned over a bit to kiss her cheek. "Ready, you got...get yourself a big breakfast, we better get going!" We were soon out the door and on our way to the coffee shop.</p> <p>"I'm not sure I can drive!" I said with a nervous giggle.</p> <p>"We'll get your ass out of bed before you fall and that's the way we will drive. I've fixed myself something that should be worth it for me!" I smiled back at her.</p> <p>"You don't really...you're the one who's gotta drive!" she exclaimed, a wry smile on her face.</p> <p>"Of course I'm the one who's supposed to drive!" I replied laughing, "Besides, I am sure we'll be having another fun day when we're in the hot tub later tonight! I wonder if I'm going to have the guts to ask! If you don't, I'll probably die of the embarrassment I feel when people look at me in the mirror when I go in with my suit...or the embarrassment of being treated like a little girl while you're taking it off to pee!" I chuckled at her humor.</p> <p>"Well maybe the first of the summer...but maybe later you can get naked again and enjoy the attention that we just gave you," she laughed again and hugged me again to her. I hugged back, and then we kissed for a while; our hands feeling each other everywhere. I had forgotten that I'd forgotten when we hugged, because I stopped the kissing, and then we started again. We were both a little hungry by now; there was already enough time left in the day to pick up a pizza and the beer we'd bought.</p> <p>We'd already finished, I'd picked up two things, a large pizza, and we started to walk over to the kitchen. I saw her eyes wander to my ass as we walked by; I saw a look of shock in her eyes, and I laughed to myself. "What's so funny?" I asked her, smiling at her.</p> <p>"I'm just wondering what you're thinking..." she said with smile.</p> <p>"I'm thinking what?" I asked, chuckling a little.</p> <p>"I wonder what you want. I guess I should give you a chance before you leave me! How about I just ask you to take me to a restaurant for your birthday meal?" I laughed again, and she laughed a lot. We got inside and started to move, pulling each other towards the kitchen. I'd never had the chance to pick up a pizza, and I guess I had the chance to pick up some beer as well - we were going to be in the hot tub again!</p> <p>We got right to the kitchen, and I started to take out the pizzas, getting some bread and a big pile of Italian bread, one slice and a huge cup of soda. I saw her eyes go to my ass again, and I laughed a little, and then she was taking in the place I'd just been in, all the while stealing quick, lingering looks at my pussy as she walked. "I guess I'm gonna get lucky today!" she said, her eyes twinkling mischievously as she was looking at my ass, my pussy, my legs...my nipples as she walked...and then she was putting the bread away on a tray, smiling down at me, as I was doing the same.</p> <p>"You're a beautiful young woman; any man would be lucky to have you in his arms!" I complimented her, and she smiled in response.</p> <p>"So, you really like it when they kiss you?" she said softly.</p> <p>"Yes I do, and I want you to kiss me too! I'm not going to let you get away with that!" she said, her green eyes sparkling with mischief. She went over to her cupboard, and turned around to place the tray there, and then returned with the pizza, saying, "Why don't you have a seat, and we'll eat while we talk, OK?"</p> <p>"Sure", I whispered, getting to the chair. She came over and sat down, and I felt her eyes on me, her mouth slightly open a few times, before looking back at the puddles of bread and the slices of bread on her plate.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I was just thinking, how great it would be to hold hands and feel good..." I stammered, and she laughed, lifting her eyes to mine again. I took a big sip of my soda as I finished my sentence.</p> <p>"...and how about I hold you here in the hot tub?" she asked while looking over at me a second timeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
