Then, leaving without a word, she walked to the door, locking it behind her.</p> <p>She came back a few moments later, giving me a quick kiss, saying it was time I went back to work for the day.</p> <p>At the last stop, I leaned back and let my brain process her every move. She was one of the best in my job, one of the best that I had ever looked at and dreamed of.</p> <p>She asked me if she could get on a call, and asked me to join her in the office before the next day came. I was very surprised, I was hoping to have lunch with her sometime soon.</p> <p>She sat in the desk, giving me a glimpse of her beautiful form, and then closed the door. She leaned back in her seat, her head still on the other side.</p> <p>After a few moments, she said how beautiful I looked in my uniform, and told me who she was.</p> <p>Then, she reached into her purse for her phone.</p> <p>"Hello?"</p> <p>"Hello, it's me, how are you? How are you?"</p> <p>"I'm fine, why?"</p> <p>"So that you could work today. So I can see what you have for me."</p> <p>"Yes, well, I want to tell you something today."</p> <p>"Yes, that's a good idea, if that's ok."</p> <p>She stood, turning her back to me, and walked back to her desk drawer.</p> <p>After a few moments, I could hear her typing on a video cam.</p> <p>"So, this is really happening, so let's get right to the point."</p> <p>I listened intently, knowing that I wanted to see what was going on.</p> <p>"So, you and I are in a relationship, a relationship of which I am your equal? This isn't sex."</p> <p>"Not quite, but I am your equal and you are my equal. I also like to have fun and you are mine."</p> <p>That was rather strange. But I wanted to watch.</p> <p>I took a moment to look at her and feel the excitement she was giving off.</p> <p>I watched her move and sit across from me, her hair falling upon her shoulders. It was a beautiful sight, she had beautiful hair which hung down her shoulders.</p> <p>"So, are you ok about this?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes, yes, it's just fine."</p> <p>"I'm just saying that she has all kinds of interests and she is my equal. Do you feel the same way?"</p> <p>I agreed but I did feel it was going too far but I was not sure what to say.</p> <p>After a few moments, she spoke.</p> <p>"We are still working on this, not that we need to have a relationship now. But, you are going too far, it's really hard. I know you and she have a lot in common but they are not identical. And, you and I are very similar in what you can feel."</p> <p>That was kind of funny. And, I think at the same time she kind of touched me.</p> <p>She continued for a few additional moments while I was lost in my own thoughts.</p> <p>She was still sitting across from me, but, she looked very much at peace for the first time since she met me. She knew, and I knew there was no turning back now.</p> <p>I was about to leave.</p> <p>She sensed it too.</p> <p>"I had such an idea."</p> <p>"What is it?"</p> <p>"First, I want you to understand that I love you and want to be with you."</p> <p>She said this as I was walking away, and then she gave me a look that said 'I'm yours'.</p> <p>Her last words were, "I love you too."</p> <p>I stopped to walk out of the office, and then walked back down the stairs.</p> <p>I looked over at her the same way I had on the phone, hoping that she loved this. I wasn't sure.</p> <p>When I got home, I took a long shower, and then I went to bed and was asleep before I even got downstairs.</p> <p>The next morning was like any other. She was in her office, finishing up some work.</p> <p>"How are you doing today, sweetheart?" she asked me.</p> <p>"I have never done anything this kind of before. Where have you been?"</p> <p>"You have been doing most of the work? I am not sure how."</p> <p>"Well, youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
