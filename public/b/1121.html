I know I've been around for a while."</p> <p>"We've been with a few people," he said, "like me."</p> <p>"We have?"</p> <p>"Yep."</p> <p>"A bit older than me."</p> <p>"Maybe. You aren't that old."</p> <p>"No, I'm a bit." He smiled. "And I think you might have just noticed."</p> <p>"But how?"</p> <p>"My name's Jason, or Tom. It's been a few years since I've been with anyone."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess it was a girl."</p> <p>I was still so stunned by what I saw and didn't say.</p> <p>"What is she like?"</p> <p>"Well, let me see," he said, "she's not great, but she's attractive. No one could guess, that's for sure."</p> <p>"Who?"</p> <p>"It's been ages since I've seen a female."</p> <p>"That's pretty interesting. Are you sure nobody's come along?"</p> <p>"It's not that different from me."</p> <p>"Are you interested in any other options?"</p> <p>Jason paused and grinned, "It depends."</p> <p>"What?," he said, "I'm not sure."</p> <p>"Well, I'd better get going. Perhaps we can get together sometime and get to know each other better.</p> <p>I nodded.</p> <p>"Come on. You can't stay."</p> <p>"No, we can go some place."</p> <p>I had never looked at Tom like this before. He was a handsome man. But this was new. His hair, I could just see his eyebrows, and maybe he had a little grey streak running in his hair as well. There seemed to be some oddity about him. I wondered what it was. It didn't matter to me. Nothing mattered.</p> <p>I was still holding my head high as Jason walked off. I decided to try to play the part of the young lady again so I would look more in his eyes and see what he was thinking.</p> <p>"You know, if all things come to pass, it'll be nice."</p> <p>"Sure," he said, "it's the only thing you could ask for when you were first told that you didn't look like a woman. And even better when you're talking to a man. Now get out."</p> <p>I took some steps toward him.</p> <p>"No, I don't need to. Leave it alone."</p> <p>"Oh, do you need help?"</p> <p>"No," he said, "just give me a hand. I'll be back in a minute."</p> <p>He had no idea where he was going, and when he reappeared it seemed like someone had knocked on the door. There was nothing else to do.</p> <p>"Where are you going?" I asked him, "and if you want you can leave."</p> <p>"No it's ok. They don't seem to know where I am."</p> <p>"I'm not going to come between you and a woman."</p> <p>"I'm not supposed to."</p> <p>"You'll have no problem making it that way. Now just move it."</p> <p>He was back in a minute.</p> <p>I thought for sure he was going to be very disappointed. And I didn't want him to suffer. I had to try, but I just couldn't stand by and watch him. He wanted a woman more than I wanted him. I wanted that, in this whole scenario, whether or not I could stay.</p> <p>I had to do something, even if it seemed like my mind was racing and my body just wouldn't do it.</p> <p>I didn't need to look at his face when I did it. I needed to look at his face anyway. I had to be honest with him, no matter what the truth may be.</p> <p>I walked toward him slowly.</p> <p>"Where are you going?" I said.</p> <p>He stared at me as I came, and it wasn't very close.</p> <p>"I'm going to stay here," he said.</p> <p>"No, you're staying here. You're spending the day with me."</p> <p>"You're kidding! What do you mean?"</p> <p>"Just so you know where I am."</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Come on. We have to go."</p> <p>"No!" I said and hurried toward the door. Jason wasn't going to let me back there. I didn't want to be apart from him.</p> <p>"OK, but don't comeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
