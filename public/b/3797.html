Did you love it?" asked the woman. She giggled at the memory of their intense lovemaking.</p> <p>"U-um, well not really," blushed Jenny, "but I didn't really give him a blow job until tonight when he came in me."</p> <p>"What happened in the bathroom last night before he left was not your idea of a blow job," said the woman.</p> <p>"Oh no," Jenny said, "my god, is that why he kept pulling his shorts down to get a better look."</p> <p>"Yes it is," said the woman. She laughed to herself. "I hope that we weren't over-reacting too quick on our part; he was so excited for what we had in store for his sweet little whore," she said giggling again.</p> <p>"God, I'm so sorry," Jenny said, "I didn't even understand that."</p> <p>"That's okay Jenny, we don't do it lightly. We never make a habit of it. We just do it for you, please don't worry about it, I don't ever know why."</p> <p>"Thanks for telling me what happened," said Jenny.</p> <p>"I can assure you that we are not over-reacting about it," said the woman. "I enjoyed it very much. So you just relax and just be with it until morning," she purred.</p> <p>Jenny smiled at the compliment. She couldn't believe the woman really called her that when she meant it. She hadn't even realized that she was wetter than she was before she came. She felt as if she had orgasms every time she spoke again, but it was like all the thoughts had passed out of her mind. She wasn't yet too old. She had always considered herself to be a good-looking lady when she had the time.</p> <p>She looked at the clock. It was nearly sundown. It was very early indeed. It was time for Jenny to wake up and get some sleep.</p> <p>"I have to get to work in a little bit," said Jenny, getting back to her feet.</p> <p>As she had suspected, it was well after seven when the early light was beginning to penetrate into the misting ceiling. She had been sleeping peacefully and it was too early for Jenny to be in a deep slumber. Jenny felt a little better after awakening, but she still felt as if she had fallen asleep. She remembered the events of the night before with her hands. She couldn't remember the words to the wonderful man she loved at that time. She didn't know where she was or what she was going to do. But it felt good. It felt very good indeed.</p> <p>"Good morning sweetheart," said Jenny. "Good morning, it's so early."</p> <p>She opened her eyes to see a smile on the face of the woman. The woman was dressed in a dark suit, but looked more like a movie star in it's tightness. Jenny's imagination had been having trouble with the woman for over a year. She had been thinking about the woman, in the ways she had always seen and heard. But she could never make her feelings known to her. She just didn't think that was it.</p> <p>"Good morning beautiful," said the woman, as Jenny opened her eyes to meet her gaze.</p> <p>As she had done every night since she and Jon had met, Jenny looked into the woman's eyes and saw love, not regret. Those eyes were filled with kindness. As for the woman...there was no doubt that there was love for her.</p> <p>The woman's eyes never wavered from Jenny's. Even when he looked into her eyes, Jenny's heart would beat faster. She could feel the same way. She knew how he felt about her. She knew that he felt like he felt for her too. And she loved to hear him tell her that. And she knew that she could do that to him without letting him know that she was doing it.</p> <p>"Good morning, Jenny," said the woman. "This is Susan. She's from London and she's going to help us in our new business."</p> <p>That was a bit unusual.</p> <p>"Please call me Susan," said Jenny softly.</p> <p>"So happy to have you back," said the woman.</p> <p>Jenny felt herself blush as she remembered the woman's beauty. She felt as if she had been in love. She felt that way again. And she wasn't the only person in the world to feel that way...not even Jon. He'd never even considered the thought of her for anything. Of course, he'd never even seen her nude. But the thought of her in that dark suit made Jenny feel just a bit more special.</p> <p>"Can you believe that I'mâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
