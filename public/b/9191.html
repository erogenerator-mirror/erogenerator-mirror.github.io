"Sometimes you can tell, some might say you can tell. Others might just be too afraid to share. It's just too messy."</p> <p>"I'm not afraid," I admitted.</p> <p>"How is it messy? I've heard it's pretty messy in the summer." My cock was hardening at the feel of his lips brushing my skin. He took my hand and leaned in to kiss it, then took my fingers and put them over hers, then rubbed her palm against mine.</p> <p>"That's it," he said. "That's how it works too."</p> <p>"But it's not always that messy," I argued. There was no place for him to hide his inexperience on the inside, no place for me to take his hand in mine in the bathroom, no one else to share those secrets with, no one else for whom to share secrets and to whom to share secrets.</p> <p>"Maybe it can make a difference," he suggested, taking my hand away. "I want to do something." He stood up and lifted the wash cloth aside, exposing my hand. "Look," he said. I watched as his fingers parted the outer lips. "You're so wet," he commented. "Like a peach?"</p> <p>I shivered as he dipped his middle finger into my slickness. "I think you missed a spot."</p> <p>I pushed back the washcloth and saw that he too was wet. "I think I missed another spot," he went on. "A spot right here, just below your belly button." His finger pressed hard against the skin there as he slid it in and out. "That's how it works, too." He touched the soft patch of flesh behind the hole at the top edge. "Like this," he dipped his finger in further and rubbed in circles. "So smooth, so soft, like the skin underneath it," he rubbed his finger in an in again. "Maybe I know how," he teased.</p> <p>"No," I argued and pushed his hands away. "You need more."</p> <p>He held his breath, waiting. He did know the right thing to say, but I found myself struggling to speak. "You're wet. I can see it."</p> <p>"And you're hard," he finished. "You're so hard. I can see it on the way down. Just a little. And I can see it right here. You're hard."</p> <p>"Yes," I insisted.</p> <p>He ran his finger around a circle on top of my clit. I could feel the warmth of my pussy radiating against his fingers. He began sliding his finger in and out, just a little, a little further down. "Tell me you like that," he murmured.</p> <p>"Yes." I took it slowly, unsure where it should go from there. My heart was in a whirly dance of nerves. I knew I wanted his finger in me but I also knew it was wrong and I needed to control my body so it wouldn't betray me. I needed to be fucked. There was no part of me that wouldn't be fucked in the same way, as if his finger had a mind of its own. Instead of fighting the temptation, which I'd come to understand at that moment, I found myself letting my hips rise into his hand.</p> <p>My thighs began to tremble. I'd wanted the feel of his body all along. The feeling of something filling my pussy and making me ache for completion. But here was this. There was only that thin layer of my self control that held me where I was: aching for a man's cock. I didn't want to stop.</p> <p>After watching me fight my body's desire to keep him in me, I understood why he wanted me to get the chance. I wasn't going to let him control our first time, and this was what it was all about. I needed to be fucked, and I needed to be fucked by a man— a man who was so close to making me his wife, his soulmate.</p> <p>"Come to me," he murmured. "Come to me as soon as we clean things up." He took my hand and led me to the bathroom. I took a deep breath as he turned on the shower and let the water run over his body. He turned back on it, then dropped to his knees and took my cock into his mouth, sliding over it as it came past his lips and bobbing it up and down. I grabbed his hair as he went, but he was eager to take his time.</p> <p>"Come for me," he moaned as he took the head between his lips. His tongue slid around the underside of the head, then slowly went further down. The first inch or so, then the next, and the next. He slid his hands up and down my—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
