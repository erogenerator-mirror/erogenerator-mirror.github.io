I said.</p> <p>"It is." Emily replied.</p> <p>"Oh." I replied after a moment's hesitation.</p> <p>"Does your mother go out?" Emily said, sounding nervous as she asked. "Sometimes for a week and not rest. Sometimes for a couple of days and again when I'm home."</p> <p>"Oh. Okay." I chuckled. "She would never go out without me, you know."</p> <p>"Oh. Mom would never wear that on a school day. And she would never wear it under normal clothes or in front of us. She'd never do that." Emily said, sounding more comfortable with the answer she knew I needed.</p> <p>"It's okay." I looked down at my boxers and blushing slightly, pulled them up. "You just go wear what you wore when we were out and not worry about it."</p> <p>Emily smiled and nodded as she got to her feet and left the room. I sat on my bed and pulled off my boxers. I put my hands over my eyes and thought about what the two of us would be like when Emily returned with the two women. There was no way in the world I would allow either of them to see me naked as I was right now.</p> <p>Emily returned with the three pairs of women who now came from the back room to the main house room. The other three were standing by the coffee table talking and drinking. "You can't believe these." Emily said, as she pulled a pair of pink satin panties out of one of the side tables. She handed each one to me and then handed them to Emily.</p> <p>We went downstairs and Emily had me sit on the couch as her mother went to get her a glass of wine. She handed Emily a glass of wine for me who took hers. Just as she'd hoped we were finished when Emily took me by the hand and led me out of the house and back to the main room.</p> <p>"I have to confess that my mind was a little foggy." Emily said, still taking the lead. "I've had these thoughts about you before, you know." She said as she looked me over as if she wasn't sure of the right answer. "But none of them were really inappropriate." Emily said as she put my hand on the door handle and opened it.</p> <p>She pulled me through, past Emily and then into a room she closed the door behind us. "Here." She said, taking the wine glass from my body and setting it on the desk.</p> <p>The other two women had gone into the room while Emily and I went into the bathroom to change. Emily looked a little flushed as she stood before her mother, naked, in front of her. Emily was looking a little uncertain, as if she wasn't sure about what to do. We had our arms around each other and she was wearing a necklace around the neck. I could see in her eyes that she was still unsure, though. And I also could tell from her eyes that she was unsure herself.</p> <p>"I can't believe we've ever been on a date before." Emily said. "This isn't supposed to be about me being your teacher. But, this is what it sounds like." I didn't know that even my mother would be so sexually excited by a woman telling me that.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I can't imagine how you should ever be in that position." Emily said.</p> <p>"This isn't about you being nervous, so please don't be." Emily said, leaning back in our mother's arms and looking me over once more. She held me close, holding me, stroking my cheek and hair.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" Emily asked.</p> <p>"This is what you felt as well." I thought for a moment. "We've never been with another man, or women or any woman that hasn't shared any of our bodies." I said, turning to Emily and holding up the last piece of clothing from her mother. "This is the first time we've slept together in my house since the beginning of this summer. You see I've always been with boys because I want to be with a man that can be trusted to protect me and my future." I said, looking into Emily's eyes.</p> <p>"I see. I guess maybe I still don't trust you too much." Emily said, but didn't say it. "You're a healthy young man. I don't want to have to change my body every month for fear it will lead to pregnancy." Emily said.</p> <p>"It's no problem. No pressure. Just don't expect me to carry a single single sperm inside me." I continued.</p> <p>"That's all right." Emily said, a bit disappointed as she said it. "It's just that you donâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
