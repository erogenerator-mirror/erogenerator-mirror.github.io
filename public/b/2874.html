Not again," he mumbled and gave up with a groan. It was so awkward. He knew he didn't need to be caught just yet.</p> <p>Gasping for air he stood up and began to dress in the bathroom. He was getting very sweaty and his hair was stuck in his face. He reached for the towel and cleaned himself up and decided his hair looked a mess.</p> <p>"It's alright. Try not to do it too long if you can keep from having that whole day behind you," he replied and continued looking around. The floor of the shower was tile covered and had no visible traces of his recent shower. He felt bad for lying but it was so hard to see over the tiles when his hair and makeup were on.</p> <p>There were a few things he didn't feel comfortable doing and he didn't want to lose an important thing in the relationship. "It's alright. I just don't want a repeat of your shower today."</p> <p>"I'll bet."</p> <p>He heard the door close and then there was a loud bang as he turned around to find her bent over by the water. He froze. Her ass and pussy were on view and it almost hurt to have him staring at them.</p> <p>"Hey, hey, no, wait, hold on," she whined and looked at him suspiciously. "Let me see your pants."</p> <p>"I don't think I should do that," he said while pointing at the bottom of the shower. "It's not right."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, but if you want me to turn around you have to do it," she said in a soft voice.</p> <p>"Look, I have to shower. I'm taking the time to change and I don't really want to ruin the time. Please don't think I'm going to just let this end," he told her.</p> <p>"I know. It's what you'll be doing anyway. Why should I let you leave me at all?"</p> <p>"Okay. It looks like we are done here."</p> <p>"It looks like you'll be showering all day."</p> <p>"Do you think my hair looks good?" she asked playfully when she saw him. He was smiling awkwardly and trying to pretend he wouldn't be caught being too obvious.</p> <p>"Of course I think you look great. And...it seems you have hair down your back too."</p> <p>"Thanks...that's very kind of you."</p> <p>"Yes, my hair does look great," he replied while looking over at her body.</p> <p>"What are you wearing?" she asked him while staring at his exposed skin. He pulled off his shirt and threw it in the same room he had yesterday and it was soaked with sweat at the front.</p> <p>"Well...nothing," he lied.</p> <p>"You aren't really going to wear something like that in my shower are you?" she questioned while pointing at himself. He felt awkward. He knew he should say something but he couldn't. He just stood there staring at her for a moment before going to his bedroom.</p> <p>When he returned his gaze to her he noticed her eyes were slightly down.</p> <p>"Don't worry. I'll probably be doing the same thing anyway. I'm sorry for having this conversation with you."</p> <p>"Please don't apologize. This is all I've ever thought about you being naked in front of me."</p> <p>"You just never know. I was just hoping to see how your hair looks."</p> <p>"That's good. So? Where are you going with this?"</p> <p>"I don't really know. I just...I'm going with my own shower," he stammered. He walked towards the door and opened it and stepped out of the shower. "Come here," he said and held out his arms for her to come to him.</p> <p>"Okay," she said with a shy grin. "Let's make this quick."</p> <p>"I know about this."</p> <p>"Okay. Let me grab my towel from the bathroom."</p> <p>They kissed passionately and left his bedroom. He found her clothes and put her clothes back in her bag and they kissed again. She took control of the situation and made him walk over to his room where she sat on the bed.</p> <p>"Where are you going?" He said while looking at her while pulling her to him.</p> <p>"I didn't know. I hope you don't mind," she said.</p> <p>"That's ok," he answered with a smile while kissing her hard. "I kind of enjoyed kissing you this morning, wasn't it?"</p> <p>"I'd like to say you enjoyed it, but you're still my brother after all," she said whileâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
