I did all I could for you, but now that I'm almost home?" Sam said. He nodded in agreement and reached out a hand to grasp the back of Karen's shirt. She put her hands over his and pulled him to her. He put one hand over both of her and the other cupping her breast. Karen slid her tongue across his and their tongues met as Sam rubbed his erection against her.</p> <p>Karen broke off quickly then, "We've only just started. I think I have a lot to do before we get any answers." She kissed him and he groaned against her. Sam kissed her ear and down her neck.</p> <p>"You taste wonderful." He said. He bit her ear slowly as she pulled him to her.</p> <p>The next few minutes were like a blur of passion as they both fought to find just the right thing to say. They each couldn't quite find the words to get out as they kissed, sucked, licked and nibbled the other’s body. Their hands were all over each other, and when Sam's hand slipped into her pants Sam moaned. They both broke the kiss.</p> <p>"I guess maybe I can get you out of these and into bed." Karen said. "That can wait." Sam lifted her shirt and Karen did the same. They looked into each other's eyes as they slid off her pants and panties. Sam's face was buried between Karen's legs, and she moaned as Sam brought his tongue to her clit.</p> <p>Karen was on fire. The excitement and danger of being caught was exciting. As Sam's tongue ran up and down Karen's pussy she thought she was being driven insane. She didn't care. She just knew she couldn't get enough of Sam's tongue. She arched her back as he sucked on her clit. Karen felt her knees go weak, but she didn't care. Her pussy began to get wetter and wetter. Finally Karen was squirting. "I think I'm cumming." she panted. "Oh no, Sam I can't."</p> <p>Sam moved off the bed and sat up beside her. "Well you know something about me and I, we can finish you off right?" he said. Karen nodded and opened her legs slightly. "Well you seem to enjoy my tongue." Sam said and kissed her again.</p> <p>"I just wanted you to know that I enjoyed it. It's been...well, pretty incredible, " she admitted. It wasn't that she didn't enjoy it, but she knew it hadn't quite worked out that she wanted more of it too. She felt so hot and wanted to return the favor.</p> <p>"Maybe next week. This might take longer." Sam said with a smile. She giggled and reached down to stroke Sam's hardness.</p> <p>"I'm serious." Karen said and kissed him. Sam kissed her back. "I have to leave my husband for a bit anyway." Sam said.</p> <p>"Don't I get a turn too then." Karen said. "You won't need to go, but I have to tell you..."</p> <p>Sam reached out and put his hand on Karen's breast. "I was hoping you guys wouldn't." he said as he pinched her nipple.</p> <p>"We can wait." Karen said.</p> <p>"You got me all excited about that." Kim said. "So what are we waiting for, " Kim said. The girls looked over at Karen. "You can stay if you want to." Sam asked but Karen declined. She leaned forward and kissed Karen. "I wouldn't put it past you to just come take me home with you. I'm sure I could find someone who would be happy to." She said and kissed her again.</p> <p>They kissed briefly and Sam and Karen made their way to the door. The walk, all the way out was a blur. When they got to the house, Sam looked at Karen and said, "I'm sorry if you had to go. I love you and I just want you to know. I will always love you."</p> <p>"Thank you. I meant what I said about being with you." Karen said. "I can't imagine being with someone as beautiful as you. You're making me feel like a woman again."</p> <p>"That's not why I'm leaving. It's what happens when I'm in charge." Kim said.</p> <p>"I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to be the only woman you'll ever have." Sam said.</p> <p>Karen kissed him and said, "That sounds nice."</p> <p>Sam leaned back against the couch. "What the hell does everybody say about anything, " Sam thought to himself. Karen turned over on all fours and stuck her ass towards him as the camera snapped pictures. Karen's ass was incredible.
