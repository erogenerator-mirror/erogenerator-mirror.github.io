She turned and looked at me with her big green eyes, "Are you ready?"</p> <p>"Yes!" I said enthusiastically. "Go put on your sexiest lingerie and come and meet me on the dance floor." With that, the women walked over to me. The redhead stood me up and her nipples were sticking straight out. The redhead walked around me, rubbing in the lube she found and massaging the inside of my thighs. Her nipples were hard and pointy and the lace top was very sheer and the material was stretched over the small of my back. When she reached the cleft of my ass, she bent her head to my pussy and licked it from bottom to top before slipping down to my asshole.</p> <p>"Ohhhh, yummy!" She said.</p> <p>She stepped back from me and looked into my eyes.</p> <p>"You taste just like you do." She said, taking my hand and putting it on her breasts.</p> <p>As I leaned on the wall, her nipples came back to life; she leaned against my shoulder to kiss my ear. "I always knew you were a great kisser." She said.</p> <p>"Thank you. What do we do next?"</p> <p>"Let's start with a special dance."</p> <p>She was right.</p> <p>"Take the champagne and pour me another one of those great white ones while I dance with you." I said.</p> <p>I took a drink from the champagne and mixed a few shots to drink. It felt wonderful. She looked me in the eye, smiled, then looked out over the street and said, "Let's go!"</p> <p>We got out in a tight-legged leather skirt and heels and each of us took a sip. She reached over, took my hand, kissed my palm, then brought it to her lips and licked the heel before pulling my hand to her lips again. The two of her licked our lips, nose and chin for a minute; then we returned to the dance floor and resumed our seat on the floor.</p> <p>The music was fast and we soon had our hands playing in our hair as we danced. Just when I thought that dancing with my first partner should be a chore, she began grinding her ass up in my crotch. The skirt was tight on me, and my cock could feel the heat coming from her. We got up onto the floor and she pulled me closer to her and we kissed. The skirt moved up and my cock poked it's way through the fabric of my shorts and she slid it up. We turned around to the music and again began a beautiful slow song. She took my hands and led me across the floor, back to my table by the dance floor, and sat down.</p> <p>"I don't believe I am even in the mood to dance." She said. "Please, do me a favor." She said.</p> <p>"Anything for the ladies."</p> <p>"The music is great. And it's not just you." She added.</p> <p>I took my hand from her breast and walked around the table for a full on inspection.</p> <p>"Do you like?" She asked.</p> <p>"Very much." I replied.</p> <p>"You must have something that will take care of your aching hard-on. I can't wait to have that thing in me." She said, putting her head on my shoulder.</p> <p>"It's getting harder and harder to concentrate with you here."</p> <p>"Yes it is," She said.</p> <p>As the song ended, the lights went up and we made our way out the bar to my table.</p> <p>"This is like a date night." I said to her.</p> <p>"No, it's not. But we will. And we will."</p> <p>"Would you like to try the dance again?" I asked her.</p> <p>"There is no hurry. It's just a slow song, not a full on dance."</p> <p>"Very good. Here is a card with you name on it and ask me what you could do to take care of my aching hard-on."</p> <p>She turned and went and pressed her hips against mine as she turned. When she was fully turned, we danced to the Latin dance, which was very fast and loud until we were all too tired. We were both tired, but when I put my hand on her thigh, she pushed it away.</p> <p>"You are a very sexy lady. I must say that I am getting very horny from dancing with you."</p> <p>"What are you doing?"</p> <p>"Just doing to relieve my aching hard-on." I replied.</p> <p>She grinned and took my hand and led me back to our table.</p> <p>We sat down and the music started again. She took my right hand and laid it on her thigh.
