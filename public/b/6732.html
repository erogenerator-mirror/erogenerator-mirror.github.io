God that felt so good I didn't care how much it hurt. I was in total control of myself as I pounded her pussy. But I couldn't stop the orgasm that was wracking my body. It was as though my body was trying to milk the semen out of my cock. But my cock wouldn't let me.</p> <p>Finally I collapsed on top of her, our sweaty bodies touching each other as though we were two people going to play the first of many games.</p> <p>We lay there for some time with me with my arms wrapped around her, not saying anything.</p> <p>I'm not sure how long we were lying there, when it hit me. She turned towards me and told me how she felt, kissed me and said:</p> <p>" I have never done anything like this before, but I did like it. "</p> <p>I still had both hands on her and it was still hard against her. Just as I thought I would stop, she started to move again.</p> <p>We didn't move for a minute, just laid there getting ready to kiss again. We were just getting ready to kiss when we heard a noise in the house. She asked me what she was looking for?</p> <p>"I think something's coming down the road", I replied.</p> <p>I didn't tell her that now was the time because she didn't reply with words. I guess she just wasn't paying attention until I was ready to tell her anything.</p> <p>" What's going to happen", she asked without looking at me and I just nodded my head.</p> <p>"Ok, if you don't care you can look. But this time I'm telling you, I'm not having sex with someone else. Not a real one, just the guy that you are feeling really close to. I know this may seem crazy, but you know I am not one of those guys. And if you don't care, then maybe you can look. "</p> <p>She wasn't even looking as she spoke.</p> <p>" I'm not sure what you said there", I said.</p> <p>"Maybe I was being a little loud" she said looking at me with those beautiful blue eyes, "but I don't think you'll need to think about it".</p> <p>I decided to move things along a little. "Ok, I'm going to go and check up on the house", I said.</p> <p>I went to my room and got dressed. After a shower, I walked back in and noticed the bed was empty. I knocked on her door that said "come in". So I knocked againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
