I had seen plenty of cocks, and all of them came to her.</p> <p>I kept my fingers in her and rubbed my thumb along her slit, sending her over the top.</p> <p>She screamed as orgasm wracked her body, and her fingers curled in my thick hair hard.</p> <p>I didn't let up after she was done, and kept playing with her clit as my thumb stroked inside her.</p> <p>She was moaning, as she grabbed my hand and pulled it away, not wanting to let it go.</p> <p>Her hands came to mine and she held them to her mouth as she gasped and moaned softly, as I brought my thumb to her mouth and sucked it.</p> <p>"Mmm..mmmm..." she said.</p> <p>She was breathing hard, and she was still a little flushed.</p> <p>I released her hand and stood up.</p> <p>She stared at me for a while, still weak-kneed. She was breathing hard from the cum on her face, and from just watching me. She was still a little dazed, but her body was still on it's wild, wildest terrain.</p> <p>I let her stand up and I led her over to the bed, sitting her down.</p> <p>"Why don't you lie down." I told her.</p> <p>She did, as her hips had never left the bed in a sexual frenzy.</p> <p>I climbed up and straddled her stomach, lowering my dripping pussy to her face.</p> <p>"Please don't." She whispered.</p> <p>As I lowered my pussy to her face, she whimpered, and her body shivered.</p> <p>I brought my knees to her arms, and pushed her legs apart, putting her cunt right in my face, as I continued to play with her.</p> <p>I brought my lips to her clit and teased it with the tip of my tongue.</p> <p>"No!" She hissed.</p> <p>I went back to teasing her clit, as I pushed my finger into her pussy, and rubbed her g-spot. Her body quivered again, and her body convulsed. Her pussy started sucking on my fingers more, it's warmth spreading through me. She started squirming, as I started to suck her clit into my mouth again, but this time, I wasn't sucking it.</p> <p>I pushed it back out, and rubbed it along my tongue.</p> <p>I sucked it inside, as her body continued to quiver.</p> <p>"No!" She moaned.</p> <p>My mouth covered her clit again, as I rubbed it between my teeth.</p> <p>"No!" She continued to wiggle against my face.</p> <p>I continued to suck on it as I pressed two fingers into her pussy, as I continued to tease her asshole.</p> <p>Her body tensed and her thighs shook as her body spasmed.</p> <p>My lips closed over her clit, as I sucked on it hard, as it exploded in my mouth.</p> <p>I let my pussy juices spill into her mouth.</p> <p>She was shaking again, and moaning softly.</p> <p>"No!" She whimpered.</p> <p>I moved closer to her face. I kissed her lips, as my body moved against hers. I moved my hips so that her hips would be pushed back against my crotch.</p> <p>"Just do it," I told her.</p> <p>She didn't move, not with my weight. She was still shaking.</p> <p>My hips pushed forward, but my body stayed still.</p> <p>"It's ok, baby, there's nothing wrong with what I'm doing. Please don't stop."</p> <p>"I'm not stopping," She pleaded softly.</p> <p>She began to wiggle against me, as her pussy continued to spasm against me. I held myself at her face for several seconds, before moving my body away to lay next to her on the bed.</p> <p>"Don't stop... please don't stop. I need you... I want you... I need you..." She whispered.</p> <p>"Why don't you get on your knees, and kiss my dick?" She said to me.</p> <p>She kneeled in front of me, and reached out and placed her nose against my dick, as she reached up under my robe and held my balls as she took them in her hands.</p> <p>She was gentle with them, as she brought her lips back to lick them.</p> <p>"If you do my dick before me, I'll get off right now, and it'll be quick," She warned me.</p> <p>I nodded, still stroking her head.</p> <p>"I want you to lick me first." She said softlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
