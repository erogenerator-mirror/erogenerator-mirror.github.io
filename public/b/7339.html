"I used to get nervous when I walked in on her and one of the boys at the park."</p> <p>I took a sip of the wine and looked up. "Did she ever tell you she was scared about marrying another man?" I asked.</p> <p>"No," she said. "I thought she was too young."</p> <p>I smiled weakly and continued, "I hope you don't mind, but I think you're beautiful and very desirable, with long hair, bright blue eyes and nice body."</p> <p>She blushed slightly, looking at me. "Well, thank—I guess not."</p> <p>"You can wear it for me anytime you want," I promised, putting a hand on her inner thigh. "It'll help keep your mind off it."</p> <p>She smiled. "I'll always wear it," and raised her eyebrows.</p> <p>"Okay, then," I said and picked up my glass and downed my wine a bit. "I know you like wine."</p> <p>She laughed again. "Thank you, and yes, I like drinking it." She turned the glass to her body and smiled. It made her breasts jiggle and I reached up to brush her hair. She smiled back, but her eyes were still half-closed.</p> <p>"I have some work to do," I said. "Come to the livingroom with me. I'll make you a nice dinner."</p> <p>"Okay, see you in a bit," she said. She rose and followed me.</p> <p>I fixed myself a couple of dishes and walked her into the bedroom where I closed and locked the door. "Take off your clothes."</p> <p>"Will it bother you?" she asked.</p> <p>"Not if you dress like a girl," I reassured her. After she was nude I made her turn around, and took the bottom of her tank top and shorts off with them. She stood before me in her pink lace bra and panties.</p> <p>"I'm not wearing anything under them," she said.</p> <p>"You're wearing me out," I smiled.</p> <p>"I like that. I just thought they would make things easier," she giggled. I reached up to feel her breasts and she lifted her arms to give me better access.</p> <p>"Let's go ahead," I said, and she took my hand and pulled me towards her livingroom. "We'll leave this to the possibility of being too loud," I added.</p> <p>She followed me through the livingroom. Her legs were crossed and she was leaning heavily against the armrest of the sofa. I bent to kiss her cheek.</p> <p>She turned her head to look at me, smiling. "I guess you're not as experienced as you think," she whispered. "I'll take a turn on the sofa." We moved to the livingroom.</p> <p>"Take your robe off," I said. "I don't want to be on display, so just do yourself." The robe fell to the floor and she knelt to pick it up. I watched the full breasts move under her bra.</p> <p>"Would you like it?" I asked softly.</p> <p>"You want it?" she asked, with a smile.</p> <p>"Yes," I said. Her mouth touched me lightly, and we moved into a deep kiss. When we came up for air, we could smell her arousal. She sucked in a breath as I pushed myself toward her, our fingers entwined. I opened the button of her bra, slipping it off.</p> <p>"Your breasts are magnificent," I said.</p> <p>"Thank you," she said, and sat back onto her cushiony sofa.</p> <p>I moved to suck on her breasts. I kissed and tongued her chest. I could smell her arousing excitement on her skin. I moved to her panties. Underneath they were soaked. I pulled the panties down slowly, dragging the top down and exposing her swollen labia. She took my head in her hands and guided me back down. Her hands pulled me in.</p> <p>"Mmm, baby, that's nice," she moaned.</p> <p>I ran my tongue up one of her nipples, then over her belly, to her hip and back down again. She pressed me into her, her hands stroking my head.</p> <p>"Ohhhh," she said, pulling me back to her lips. "Oh God, baby. I love your tongue in my pussy." Her hands were now holding my head in place, pulling me into her body. She moaned.</p> <p>I lapped at the pink folds of her labia, parting the pussy lips with my fingers. She ran her fingers over my back, tracing small circles. She was rubbing herself against me, rubbing me—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
