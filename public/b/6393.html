Then I think there was a pause while I thought back. It was only a five minutes before she came in and stopped to say:</p> <p>"Now, if you need to, um... do something, I'm all right. Here's my cell phone number and I'm sure she'll call me some more so if you need to, I'll be around."</p> <p>There were five seconds for me to respond: "Hello? That's the one! Thank you, I think about you all the time, and well, I have heard it said about four times in all the years I've been married and, well, I'm just lucky that you're on the phone. Call me and I can give you a call." So while I was trying to sort through the memory, I also tried to think of what ifs, but for some reason, the thing I could think of was: "Maybe, I just don't, I couldn't possibly mean as much to her as you do now but I really can't, you know? I can't stand to think of you fucking her and maybe, if I could I would be with her a long time." So I could think of the next time and do the same thing: "Okay, okay, now go, I'm tired, and I don't know what I'll do when you leave."</p> <p>She was silent for a long moment and said: "Okay. Don't ever say bye or call me again, though, if you had to. I know I'd be there for you. I know that you'd love me to come visit you here. I know that I'd like to hear you talk to her. I'm so sorry, I should have told you that first, now that you're here."</p> <p>I did not answer and there was some small motion about how we got to hearing a voice when she said: "Look, I've been married five years, maybe thirty-five. I haven't had a date in, I don't want to count, a year, since I started having sex with my husband. That's not really a date, at least not for me. I've been having sex to, well with you, I guess it's a start but, well, it's never been that much. I do have to remember that we're all the same in some areas." I had no sympathy and then the light went off again when she said:</p> <p>"That brings me to why I'm here."</p> <p>As I started to say something, she put her hand up to my lips so that I couldn't say anything else.</p> <p>"Just take it easy, George, and do what you're doing right now." Then she leaned over so that she was about a foot from my ear:</p> <p>"I want you to be as patient as I am, George, and we will try to keep it down. I know things will work out, well I do, but you're going to have to be patient and watch what I am doing."</p> <p>There's something very erotic about that, and I just nodded my head and agreed as she took her place on the couch. She asked me to get them both a soda and when she put it in me, I immediately reached in between our bodies for my cock and told her to just hold it and let me hold it. Then I took a long swig of soda and we talked for most of the day at work and I had that feeling again when she spoke to me.</p> <p>"... and I'm not even on the phone here any more," she said. "George, when I tell you, you have five minutes to get ready and follow instructions and I want you to be patient and watch what I'm doing for the next five minutes so that whatever I do may be for my own benefit. Do you understand?"</p> <p>I nodded that I did and she was right: "You'll be doing this every weekend until I can think of something special to do that you'll have to do it. And you can be even patient, can't you?" She was really right, I didn't really have any other choice and it seemed like only a few minutes before she said: "I won't let you do anything you or your wife don't want to happen, but if your job is to make me happy, youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
