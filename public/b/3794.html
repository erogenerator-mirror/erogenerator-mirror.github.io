Fuck, fuck! Ahhh!" she cried out as she lifted her head once more from the pillow, pushing her chest out as her body shuddered in pleasurable waves of ecstasy.</p> <p>Once her body relaxed she began to lay back down, her head on the pillow. "My God, that was incredible. That was almost...incredible." She gasped, then looked over at me and said, "I can feel you getting hard again."</p> <p>I stood up and quickly stripped my shorts off, then, after a brief struggle, my shirt joined it on the floor, followed by the rest of my clothes. I lay on my side looking at my wife, who appeared blissed out.</p> <p>"That was fabulous," she said, her voice quiet as she gazed at my body lustily.</p> <p>"You think you can do it again?" I asked. "It really turned you on that way? 'Cause I'm pretty good at doing that."</p> <p>"I've never done it in front of anybody before, but it was very nice. I was so pleased when you pushed it in."</p> <p>"Not that I was complaining. I didn't think it would fit, but it feels different to do that."</p> <p>"I don't mind, it's your body," she said, her nipples quickly going rock-hard, causing large goose bumps to run over her chest. "You were very gentle when you were fucking me on top of the bed, so you have no chance to cum."</p> <p>"Well I didn't make love to you then." I replied. "But after I went down on you, it sure felt good."</p> <p>"Good...very...hard." she said as she moved one hand to the back of my thighs and massaged them, then slid it upward slowly until it touched her hand on top of my hard shaft.</p> <p>I felt her fingers working it up and down as she rubbed the tip. I felt as though there might be an uncomfortable knot in my gut when she felt it, but felt as though a weight was off in my belly.</p> <p>"Feel like someone's trying to move it through my hand." I said as I pulled on the hair on her scalp.</p> <p>She looked up at me with those big blue eyes like saucers. "Is that my way of saying you'd like to cum?"</p> <p>"Nooooo." I said, a bit nervously. "It's just you and me, maybe you'd better ask for it somehow."</p> <p>She smiled, then slowly raised her hand up to her mouth and slowly sucked on the tip, her lips and chin glistening with our juices. Once she was sure she got it all, she closed her mouth and smiled at me.</p> <p>"Well, now you can see why that's the case." she said as she stood up and moved around on the bed, getting the use of her hand on a regular basis. "I didn't cum from my own hand on your cock, only from yours. I'm glad that there aren't that many others..."</p> <p>She took my hand and placed it on her stomach, then lowered herself onto it slowly, kissing the skin above her pussy when she got to the end of it. I held my hand up just above hers, as her breathing became shorter. She opened her legs wider and I pushed one of mine downward just as I pressed on the little hump that was between them. As I pushed harder with each thrust her pussy got even more open for my hand and my fingers went in a little easier than they had before.</p> <p>My dick slipped into her easily, feeling how wet there was. And then I pressed down harder as I began pumping my fingers in and out of her, watching her face as my hand worked her in a perfect position. Once she settled down on my hand I began to fuck her with it while it worked on my cock at the same time. Once we got a good rhythm going I slowly slid my hand up her body a little and held my hand up against her abdomen as my cock worked back and forth inside her.</p> <p>I was surprised at how quickly this was becoming a familiar sensation. It never took me long to cum, and the second wave of climax was just a little less intense. And then her head started bobbing back and forth rapidly and I was worried she'd start to panic.</p> <p>"Are you OK?" I asked.</p> <p>She said, "Yeah, just a little tense here."</p> <p>"Yeah..." I replied, wondering how I could keep from getting carried away againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
