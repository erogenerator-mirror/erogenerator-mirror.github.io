It was wonderful. It was a wonderful feeling. I loved doing that. I just knew that when I had done it, it'd make my life hell.</p> <p>I was fucking myself. I was being fucked. I was being fucked. I was his fucking, I was his big, beautiful cock. God, it felt wonderful. I wish I was there to be there and having those thoughts, while he was fucking me. I wish I was there with them.</p> <p>I didn't hear his car go by. I didn't even know he was there. I didn't see anything. I didn't feel his cum go into me. I didn't feel him cum in me.</p> <p>But then when I do that, when I'm fucking myself with my big dildo, I think of him doing it to me.</p> <p>All it did was say, "Fuck, fuck, fuck". It's all he said.</p> <p>He got out, got dressed and left.</p> <p>I left the apartment that night. I didn't say goodbye. I didn't give him a kiss or a hug. I didn't give him anything. I'd just give him a kiss and let him go.</p> <p>I didn't see him around the apartment, any more. I really didn't see or hear anything. It was dark and quiet. I had to pee.</p> <p>That was three weeks before I went on my first double date with my ex with her and her boyfriend and she had two of her roommates of course. But by then, it was so long ago by then that I was having a pretty bad start. I'd been married again for four years and had never had a single date with anyone else.</p> <p>A couple of times, we'd gone to a hotel on one of the many weekends that I was available. We'd been in all sorts of hotels, in all sorts of places. The last one I remember was on my second visit. I was at the bar with this guy. He introduced me to a guy that he worked with.</p> <p>He was in his mid-40's and I could tell that this guy was very interested in me. I didn't want to mess things up with any of them.</p> <p>But then he looked at me with his dark eye as he said, "Why don't we get out this way."</p> <p>"Hey, man!" I said. "Please don't mess things up."</p> <p>"Hey" he replied. "What are you getting from that?"</p> <p>"Well, I want you to put my ex down on the floor. I'm going to fuck her silly, right?" I said as I walked out the door.</p> <p>I walked past the guy in the lobby of the hotel and then left the bar. I went to this guy just minutes after that.</p> <p>I had met him for coffee. That is, he had coffee with me. I was going to tell him to come to the table and he'd have to wait. I was just about to take his wife in, and take him out of the bar when there were two guys in the back. I wasn't going to sit and talk to him, I was going to go ahead.</p> <p>I walked over to their table about ten minutes later. One of them immediately made a comment that was both embarrassing and exciting. He got a little more aggressive and started to slap me, a little harder than a lot of guys were.
