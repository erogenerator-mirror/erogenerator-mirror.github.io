In reality, I just wasn't used to it. But I wasn't in this position on all fours in this huge, open bed! Kara began to hump against the back of the sofa, slowly moving her hips.</p> <p>Kara: "Don't stop."</p> <p>Kara: "I don't think I'll be able to get it up again."</p> <p>Kara: "I want to cum with you."</p> <p>Kara: "Come on. I'm so close. Let's do it!"</p> <p>Kara was so loud that I could hardly hear her. She had lost all control. A few seconds, Kara had reached the pinnacle.</p> <p>Kara: "Oh, K, you feel so good!"</p> <p>As she came, she held onto me with all my weight and speed.</p> <p>Kara: "Oh, my baby! I'm close!"</p> <p>I felt her vagina contract in orgasm. She ground her hips a couple more times and I felt the orgasm run its course.</p> <p>Kara: "Oh, K, come in me!"</p> <p>She pulled me tight against her. I felt myself go from light post-coitus bliss to a haze of euphoric exhaustion. Kara slowly rolled onto the sofa next to me. My dick was still in her and still twitching.</p> <p>Kara: "Do you think you could ever get this down again? We're both exhausted!"</p> <p>I was about to say yes, but stopped myself. I just laid there.</p> <p>I was too exhausted to speak. I just laid there until I heard the familiar sound of a zipper and the mattress springs squeaking. Kara had her pants off and was climbing onto me.</p> <p>Kara: "We'll have to get you some sleep. You might need it."</p> <p>My cock was lying pressed against her pussy. She was right. It felt so good.</p> <p>Kara: "Oh, my baby. I do love this!"</p> <p>I didn't know what to say. It was so unbelievable to have her in bed with me, in the room with three naked women! I was completely naked. It was like I was on another planet!</p> <p>Kara: "This is so good!"</p> <p>"It feels so good to have you here," I thought.</p> <p>"And me in here," said Kara.</p> <p>Kara: "We made you cum in my pussy twice!"</p> <p>I didn't think that was very fair (if she never had the ability to call orgasms with me), but it felt fantastic. I began to think about when it was my turn to come. This would be the first time for me to cum. In a strange way, it was really exciting to have a woman on the verge of another orgasm. It was definitely a turning point for me. My mind began to wander. I began focusing on what was transpiring. It occurred to me that I really did enjoy fucking Kara's roommate, Amy. I was beginning to think that she and I might be a little weirded out that way. I just didn't have the capacity to go through with it with that woman. My mind began to wander.</p> <p>Kara: "Oh, my baby, I really want you in me."</p> <p>My mind was beginning to float again and I was starting to panic. I thought I was getting pretty close to climaxing again. I knew this might be wrong. But I was so close. But before I knew it, I heard a little panting.</p> <p>Kara: "That's just for starters!"</p> <p>Kara: "No, not for starters. I'm so tired right now that I just need a release!"</p> <p>I wasn't thinking about it. This was definitely an idea to have a threesome. It was something I had never considered. But still, my mind was in a fog. I couldn't let myself think about this too much. If I made too many mistakes, I would just laugh it off. Kara must have been a bad influence on me. It might have even been an idea, but I was really focused on my sexual satisfaction. I could get so carried away that I would have to think about it.</p> <p>Kara: "Oh, my baby!"</p> <p>I tried to lie. It was so difficult. I struggled so hard and my mind was spinning. Finally I was able to get out "Kara, stop it. It's too much."</p> <p>"I'll try to stop it," said Kara. She sounded unconvinced.</p> <p>Kara: "Kara, I really do need to think about it."</p> <p>I was getting desperate for some relief.
