The tip of his thick finger brushed her clit. She groaned and pushed against the base of his finger.</p> <p>"Oh, yes!" she yelled, as she started to climax.</p> <p>"Your pussy tastes delicious," he said, as he slid his finger in and out of her pussy, his fingers stroking her inner pussy walls while he felt her orgasm.</p> <p>"Oh, yessss," moaned Sarah while the climax slowly faded and his fingers slowed.</p> <p>'Is this right, sweetie?' he thought to himself, as he slid his fingers out of her pussy.</p> <p>"God, yes, that was incredible!" she exclaimed.</p> <p>She stood to kiss him. He wrapped his arms around her, returning hers for more of her.</p> <p>She stood up and helped him up out of the Jacuzzi, sitting down on his lap as she stood at the end of the tub to kiss him again. His hand slowly came up her leg, caressing her as they kissed. He felt her body move as he slipped his hands higher up under her robe. When he felt her ass cheeks, he pulled her down, bringing her to him with both hands around her.</p> <p>"Mmm...yessss," she purred as she felt the hardness of his erection poking against her through the thin swimsuit. She rubbed her ass on it, feeling the fullness of his hard-on as she rubbed against his.</p> <p>Their mouths opened, her tongue slipping into his mouth to duel with his. She could feel his hard-on, throbbing as he rubbed against her. This was the first time he'd done this with a woman. She had to admit it was exciting. He kissed his way down her body, kissing her neck and chest as his hands came up to caress her breasts.</p> <p>He felt her breasts pushing against his hands, her nipples hardening with excitement. He ran his fingers along her areolas, feeling the firmness and the pink color of her breasts. Sarah groaned as she felt his lips trail down to her breast, suck her nipple. He sucked her nipple in his mouth, nibbling it gently as she pushed his face toward it. He gently nibbled her breasts, feeling the shape and hardness of his nipples as he did so.</p> <p>While he was doing this, she reached down and grabbed his stiff dick, feeling it bob in her hand. She moved her hand down to feel its length while his mouth sucked her nipple. The feel of it excited her a lot more than it did before. He sucked her a little harder then, as he gently bit and pulled on her breast with his teeth.</p> <p>She felt his hands move down to her pussy, opening her lips and slipping a finger gently between them. One hand held his cock while the other worked her clit lightly again. She groaned as he took his mouth off her breasts and slipped his finger in her pussy again. She groaned again as he slipped the finger up to touch her G-spot. She knew she would cum any second now, but she wanted him too.</p> <p>"I want to make you cum, Sarah. I want to make you crazy with pleasure," he said as she pushed his hand away.</p> <p>He smiled at her, leaned forward, and took her nipple in his mouth again, drawing it with his lips and tongue.</p> <p>'Oh, yes! Yes!" she said, as she felt her orgasm start to build. Suddenly, the dam burst, her whole body shaking as pleasure rushed through her body at the first touch of his tongue to her clit. She felt his lips move over her clit, stroked her and sucked on it and her entire body shuddered with pleasure. The orgasm was strong, but the feelings weren't as intense as the last one.</p> <p>He held onto her breast with a grip around it while his finger gently stroked her G-spot, while he sucked that nub between his lips.</p> <p>"I love you, Sarah," he said and looked up at her. "I love you, sweetie. And I love you, sweetheart."</p> <p>"I love you, too. And I love you, sweetie!" she replied as they hugged.</p> <p>Afterwards, she dressed and went to the kitchen to prepare the food.</p> <p>"Let's eat some dinner," she said as she handed him the plates.</p> <p>"Good choice," he said.</p> <p>They ate in silence. He ate in silence.</p> <p>"So, how did the sex with you end up?" he said after looking at her.</p> <p>Sarah smiled. "I told you, and you're right. We had both been sexually excited. I had a few inhibitions, but I enjoyed it very muchâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
