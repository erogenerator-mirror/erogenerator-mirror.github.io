He took a bite of his beer. "It was amazing. The more he ate me, the harder I got. After I finished, he went on to work on my clit. He ate my pussy like nothing else I've ever experienced. Afterwards, he told me to kneel over that thing. When my lips were pressed firmly against it, he stood over me and rubbed up and down it."</p> <p>"Well, you did what I want. Now let's go fuck."</p> <p>I sat on the edge of the bed and opened my legs. "Go on, slide it in, baby. Now!"</p> <p>He did. After all the orgasms, and a few orgasms that left me nearly asleep, he slid his long cock all the way in.</p> <p>I said to myself, "God, that's good. God, this feels amazing. He was really working up to me. He was slamming me hard, his belly and chest slapping against me. I thought my body would snap in two or three. I loved it. A man's body felt so good pressing against me."</p> <p>He started to get a rhythm going. "God, you're so tight. That's so fuckin wild."</p> <p>"I loved every second of it, baby, I really loved how he just kept it up and kept going."</p> <p>We were on our sides, with him kneeling over me and me at a lower angle. After about ten minutes or so, he pulled his cock out and said, "You ready to climb on top?"</p> <p>"Fuck yea," I said as I lifted my legs up and wrapped them around his waist.</p> <p>He pushed his cock in, as I began to ride up and down.</p> <p>He began to pump up and down, as I began to cum again and again, riding him, as I let out a moan every time it hit me, each hit seeming much louder.</p> <p>"God, you feel so good. Yeah, keep going baby," he said as I continued to ride him.</p> <p>I looked over at the camera. It showed his wife, who was watching all this on the computer.</p> <p>"Wow," I said, "This is great. He's really taking it out of me," I continued to ride him, "but I think he's about to blow his load. He'll soon be on this one."</p> <p>He grabbed my hips, and pulled me onto his rock hard cock as he sent his cum directly into my cervix. I just looked down at him and kept riding him as his cock pumped and pumped into my cervix.</p> <p>As his cock was fully imbedded in me, I leaned back, and slid down, sitting on him and started riding him slowly again. "I love it," I said, "This isn't going to be easy. I'm on a mission to finish him off as quickly as possible before I have to go home."</p> <p>He just smiled, as the head of his cock was still still inside me, he gave me a kiss, one on the cheek, and said, "You're right, I better get some sleep now. I'll be up this morning."</p> <p>"Good night, honey," I said as he closed his eyes as he fell into a deep sleep.</p> <p>I got up and slipped out of bed and took my clothes off. I walked into the shower, and as I was waiting for it to warm up, I slid my hands over my breasts and touched my clit, slowly I got them together, and began making my way back into the bedroom.</p> <p>As I walked through the room with a smile, I stopped and watched for about ten minutes. I turned my head back around, and slowly began removing my nightgown. The soft nightgown fell to the floor. I slipped my arms out of the nightgown and took the nightgown off to let it fall the rest of the way to the floor at my feet. Now, completely nude I got down on my knees, and took hold of his cock. Just putting it in my mouth, as I stroked him and pumped his cock a little. As I bent over to kiss him, my breasts were just inches away from his face. I had my hands on his hips as I kissed him, letting my tongue just brush with his as he wrapped his arms around me. "I love you too," I whispered into his ear. I just felt like I was in a dream.</p> <p>"I love you too, sweetie."</p> <p>I went back to sucking him, and slid off the bed, and went to the door. I opened it and stood up, turned around, looked into the mirror. I reached for the door knobâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
