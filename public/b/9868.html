He felt his cockhead as it entered her waiting pussy. She tensed up as if trying to keep her hymen intact. After a momentary hesitation his cock found her cunt hole and pushed past it, in and out at a steady pace.</p> <p>"Oh my god." she moaned. "You're doing it."</p> <p>When he finally pushed her back down it was too late. He had thrust in fully, his hands holding her legs up and back, his hands on her ass, moving in and out of her at a quick, rhythmic pace without the need of pulling out.</p> <p>"God yes," she moaned, "so fucking good."</p> <p>"I love feeling your cunt squeezing around my cock, you're my whore," he breathed into her ear as he used one of her legs to press against her chest, causing it to bounce up and down.</p> <p>She moaned in encouragement and he felt his cock sliding back in until just the head was still inside. She squeezed her cunt in rhythm with his cock. He slowly pulled it out and then pushed all of it back in, picking up speed with each thrust.</p> <p>"You'll love it," he told her. "I'm going to give you a little more of my cock."</p> <p>She lifted her ass off the bed slightly, pushing against him. "God I love this," she said. "Your cock is so good."</p> <p>He could feel the muscles of her cunt clenching around his cock each time he reentered her. He moved his hands back to her ass and gripped her cheeks as he pushed his cock into her as if it was going inside of her. He felt her muscles begin to loosen and tighten around his cock and he knew she was on her way to an orgasm.</p> <p>"Fuck," she said. "I'm going to...Oh my god...I'm going to cum again."</p> <p>Then something amazing happened. He felt her come, her muscles milking his cock. He let go but not before he had exploded, his cock shooting his load in her. He held both of her ass cheeks as he came, his hands gripping her ass from behind as he came. When his cock was finally gone, they collapsed in a heap of arms and legs.</p> <p>"I guess you've had enough!" she said in astonishment. "We're supposed to be married, right? It's just...."</p> <p>"No, it's not," he said. But I do get to fuck other married women, isn't that right?"</p> <p>She giggled. "You can," she said. "Just don't try to sneak around any. I want you to feel me every chance you get. I want you to do it. That's the only way I'll let you."</p> <p>He pulled her from the bed. "You're a wonderful woman," he told her. "You don't know how much I appreciate that."</p> <p>"That was...I don't know..."</p> <p>"It's nothing you haven't already done. I enjoyed your pussy as much as you enjoyed my cock," he told her, feeling a bit of jealousy in her.</p> <p>"I don't do this for my husband, either," she said with an exaggerated tone. "This is your last chance. There is only one way to go...so it would best be now, okay? I feel you and I would be cheating on my husband, right?" she said, rolling onto her back. "And there won't be any chance to stop us. You're our husband, right?"</p> <p>"Sure," he said. "You have another chance at this."</p> <p>"But I feel so guilty about the way we're doing it!"</p> <p>"That's okay. Your husband can't force you to do this. You can still let me keep doing it, after all?"</p> <p>"I don't doubt you could just pull away," she said. "I might not stop you. Let's just hope our husband is okay with it."</p> <p>They lay still for a while looking at each other. "You'll have to show me how that works," Eric told her. "I'll tell you how it works when we're done."</p> <p>They sat up quickly, running their hands down each other's bodies as they embraced. She started by running her fingers over his chest and then around his cock, stroking and tickling it with her fingers. He felt her warm, soft fingers wrap around it and then they were back to caressing his body.</p> <p>Her touch felt so good. He felt her lips brushing across his neck as their kisses got hotter.
