He's a good kid."</p> <p>"I'm not worried about that kid. The only thing I'm concerned about is that you might be ready for more."</p> <p>"As ready as that may be."</p> <p>"I'm not going to try and be a 'boy' anytime soon though."</p> <p>"You didn't think we could get you up until after your eighteenth birthday? It's not that you haven't been with some of us, or at least we haven't. We've been waiting for you this long, I think we'll have you in the mood before Halloween." He gave her a half scowl. It was the first time she had ever seen him this angry before. Not only had she come so close to calling the shots here, she had also called him a pussy, a cock tease, a piece of ass and now she was going to get her wish. "Whatever you want. Anything else I can think of for you to consider, but right now I think I'd like to just drop in and get some more of that wonderful dick of yours. I haven't had the chance to make a proper choice in coming out of my marriage and you know just how much I love you."</p> <p>She couldn't help feeling that she had to give him this much more than what he had to give her. She knew that she wanted to tell him how that felt, not the kind that he would do. "I can't let you think that way. Not after what you've already seen." He gave her another playful slap as she was about to say something else. "I really do have to go, I've got an important thing to do first. I just told them all that you were going to do the same thing that you're probably planning to in the future. When do you want to do it?" His tone implied that he wanted her to do it right away, but she didn't answer.</p> <p>"Fine, I'll meet you here in the morning, by the way. You can get dressed or let yourself into the house if you want. Or do with me as you wish."</p> <p>"Okay!" She took off in a rush, heading up to the bathroom to shower and change. When she finally showered, she decided to get dressed before she had an opportunity to leave. She could only imagine what kind of consequences there might be when she did later. She decided that now was not the time to do that. She was going to call her friends and tell them she was going out for a few more drinks, which she would hopefully do when she got her chance.</p> <p>"Are you sure you're all right?"</p> <p>"I'm definitely fine." She quickly grabbed all her things and went out into the kitchen. The house was quiet, with only a few people milling about. Not that the conversation had even gotten a little sexual, because she wasn't in the mood. The only thing she was really thinking about was the fact that she was going to have sex with the man she was going to marry the very next summer, without telling anyone of her decisionâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
