I asked.</p> <p>"Yes, and if you want to continue, I'd love to lick-off that sweet load of yours, then suck on it like it's mine."</p> <p>"Yeah, of course I want to and I won't break for it" I reassured her. A bit of a surprise to me, but not as much of a surprise to her as having no idea it had been a fantasy that had come true. She laughed nervously, then took the towel off me like I'd been a boy, and put it to her head, covering her entire head with her hair. "Here, turn around and get that other end," she ordered, as she went to her knees.</p> <p>I did it, then stood behind her and started rubbing my hard cock up and down her shaved bush.</p> <p>"There's no time like the present," she cooed. "Now let my tongue work on your clit, and see how much of that creamy goo you got. When you're ready, you can lick mine and come here.</p> <p>I couldn't say yes, nor could any woman, though I could think of a few. This was all new to me. I never even considered it before.</p> <p>"Can I kiss it?" she asked, then took her own tongue out to rub and then suck on it. She opened her mouth and moved her lips closer to me and did some sucking.</p> <p>"No, don't," I pleaded. "Do it slowly. It just means, don't fuck it up, not yet."</p> <p>With that, I got down on my knees behind her and stuck a long, wet finger up her pussy, while still rubbing her clit. "Go slow," she cautioned. "It isn't for everyone! It's for me."</p> <p>I felt the first thing she was doing, for some reason, it must have been the sensation of rubbing herself against my finger. She was definitely wet. I put some more of my finger up her ass, and probed a little then pulled all the way out.</p> <p>"There," she said. "Now it's the same thing. It will feel different."</p> <p>I stuck a second finger up her other hole, and continued to feel for the first time how it felt. I added two more fingers, and found that I liked it more and much more, even though it had an unusual tightness there.</p> <p>"Mmm, nice," she cooed. "But a little more."</p> <p>I had worked that whole thing up with my fingers, it made for a very interesting kind of anal stimulation. I had an idea of a few things I had not. But for now, just feel free to do whatever you want with me.</p> <p>"Mmmm, this feels nice," she cooed. "It's nice and wet, and so warm. It's a nice little hole."</p> <p>I worked on her for several minutes, and she was gasping and squirming.</p> <p>"Mmm, better, don't forget that," she warned. "Mmm, oh, mmm, that feels nice! Don't stop, please!"</p> <p>"I don't want you to stop, or else," I said, pulling on her clit. "You can make it even better for me!"</p> <p>That got a grunt from her, and a yelp from me, then she was writhing, like I'd hoped she would, but just as I hoped she would, her pussy tightened, and I felt her inner muscles clench. I pulled back, then looked at the wetness of her pussy lips, and the dark hole they held, and pushed up again, then pulled back down again.</p> <p>"Oh, oh, oh yes!" she groaned. "Oh, oh, yes!"</p> <p>"That's it," I said, and kept going.</p> <p>"Mmm, oh, mmm, oh, it feels nice, and you know I like it," she said, as I kept up this steady rhythm.</p> <p>"You know it's coming, then you're going to get the real thing," I said, as I put both fingers back up her, and rubbed up and down, a little faster now.</p> <p>"Yes, yes," she grunted through gritted teeth.</p> <p>"I want you to come for me," I said. "Come all over my fingers, make it all good."</p> <p>Her hips were moving against my thrusts now, and my fingers were sliding in and out. "Yes! Yes!
