You know... And make love to me for a long time with your cock..." Katie's voice trailed off into a pensive laugh, and she had reached one elbow under her chest to scratch her clit as she felt her body tightening under the touch of Ben's cock, "I might even let you fuck me once or twice more..." Katie couldn't believe she actually wanted that, and how much of a relief it would be now that he and Katie had finally been able to act out a fantasy, for once.</p> <p>"Katie!" Ben shouted, "Are you OK over there? You look like you're having something on your face. Do you want a glass of wine? I would have one, if I was you," Ben stepped up and kissed her hand, "And when I get to that room, I'll tell all of the guys about you... It would be way too much without those two... And if you know what I mean!"</p> <p>"Oh Ben," Katie said as she reached her other hand up, "That's the greatest thing anyone has ever said to me.... And they'd say that to me... Like you just do."</p> <p>A couple of hours later, Ben took Katie out in a white BMW truck for lunch while they all sat around the pool drinking beer, talking quietly about what was about to happen the night before when the two women got up to use the restroom. They walked out of the restaurant hand-in-hand, as Katie reached into her purse for a tube of something more than Ben's cock-juice.</p> <p>Ben's dick swelled into life as he watched Katie pull off her top, before she stepped out of it and dropped it to the floor. Katie stepped out of it at the pool and turned so her back was to the men in the truck, and Ben could see the curve of the butt-cheek as she bent over to pick it up.</p> <p>Ben had never had a woman bend over so seductively in all their years together, but the sight of the woman in the mirror made his dick throb with energy as he imagined her beautiful ass and pussy sitting against the side of his truck. He was sure as hell about to walk in there, and do nothing about it. Right now, he had Katie in his truck, and he was about to give her that ass for real, and then he'd do it himself.</p> <p>"Oh baby!" Ben growled at Katie as she bent over, "You're gonna wear this for me... You think you can come in and fuck me, just like you did before? Well you can make me wait a bit, or you can let it go, but I'll fuck you like I always wanted if you want to. Besides, you know the old lady would kill me if she ever caught me with you...."</p> <p>Katie giggled as her eyes were squeezed tightly shut, and she felt herself being pulled up against her legs, before she felt the head of Ben's cock push into the crack of her ass. She squeezed down on the shaft, feeling the warm, thick head rub against the soft folds of her pussy lips. It did feel good. Katie couldn't remember ever being so wet! She looked over her shoulder and could only see the truck as it drove down the road... Ben's hand reached around and pinched her hard nipple- her hands slid over to her clit again, and she felt the tingling that would go on for minutes and that she could go on forever.</p> <p>She leaned back into Ben's chest, and let his cock rub against her clit with every stroke, making her body tingle from the pure pleasure of him pressing into her ass. "Oh Ben... I want to hold you, and hold you forever... I just want to put you on your way now!" She gasped as she felt him slowly slip from her and she felt his body pull her tight against him.</p> <p>Ben had a little more to offer, but he wasn't about to break her, and for those few moments, he had Katie in his arms. When they had pulled back, Ben was able to look down into her shining face. He had just stepped back when they had stepped under a few more leaves, and they had been just moving away when he saw Katie's face twitch from Ben's touch:</p> <p>"Well... that worked!...." Ben grinned, "That was kind of like the fantasy I'd had with you for the first time... I could feel you pressing against me. I knew then I had found a real man to fuck me with all I had..."</p> <p>When Katie reached her hand out to Ben in the cab of the truck, and his semi-hard dick slapped its way through the crack of the door between their seats, she felt it press against her hand. "I have to have it!" she said, "If I really wanted it... I wouldnâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
