She could get it again. Just one thing, she told herself, and if the chances of her getting it again the next day were as good as this one had been, and the possibility was better, then there should be no way this was going to end up being a good or lasting experience, right?</p> <p>She wasn't disappointed. It had taken only thirty seconds to get through. But then, how could anybody expect their first time to be like this? Or do they expect to have a lifetime of sex, and the next thing she'd be on the pill and doing it with no consequences? But then, what had the guy in high school said when he'd caught her giving him an all-too-familiar smile when she asked him if he loved her?</p> <p>At the end of her second or third try, he'd said, "No, please don't stop. I love you, Amanda."</p> <p>At least she would have said that she loved him.</p> <p>"Oh, my God. If you stop now, I'll be sorry I promised you I wouldn't."</p> <p>"I love you!" she told him and kissed him, and he had started to go limp, but she just pulled him up, gave him a kiss and went to the bathroom.</p> <p>He watched her walk out of the bathroom, her sexy ass, swaying with every step. He wondered if she knew he had cum in her and felt like he'd never stop until he came again tonight. No chance of that.</p> <p>After her shower, she decided she didn't look back at him if she hadn't asked.</p> <p>But instead, she found herself naked on his couch getting drunk. But then, what was she doing doing with a beautiful guy like him who was going to be the perfect man for her?</p> <p>Was she really going to stay with him?</p> <p>Could she really do it again, as easily as this last week had been? She couldn't believe the things he had been saying to her just before they had been interrupted. And she was actually going to admit to herself that once the night was over, there wouldn't be any more. A better decision had been to stay with him, but that wouldn't have felt right.</p> <p>To be honest, the idea of having another man's sperm in her mouth, on her body and in her womb, would probably be the best decision she'd ever make. Maybe because it was so wrong and taboo, and for some strange reason, that thought made her shudder and she decided that she liked him even more. But that was a long time ago.</p> <p>Maybe it was a long time before he'd touched her, even though he had certainly rubbed her thigh up her leg in her past, and now she could hardly feel it, given the way he'd touched her.</p> <p>Maybe this wasn't the time for the long relationship. Maybe she had to live with a long, lonely past. Perhaps it was time to start looking around for a future that would last forever, that she would be able to say goodbye to the pain and loneliness of childhood.</p> <p>Maybe, though, this was a long way from where it should be.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Amanda sat at a crowded table with friends, looking out the window with her coffee, sipping the brand that had been her only other drink after so many days.</p> <p>"Amanda," Ryan called.</p> <p>"Yes, Ryan?" she answered.</p> <p>"I'm sorry if I've got it wrong," he said, and his eyes fell to the empty mug. "I'm not gay, but I was raised that way. I never wanted to be. Or you, for that matter. But I would rather not have my past ruin the moment of happiness I feel right now."</p> <p>"Not in my lifetime," she replied, and his eyes lifted to hers. "What makes you think I would like to be with you?"</p> <p>"I'm not sure I really want to know. I'm not thinking about how it will feel. Even if you want to, that is, there's no holding me back now, is there?"</p> <p>She nodded. "I like it that way. It feels normal, isn't it?"</p> <p>"Yes," he said. "But there's nothing for me to be happy about, or to be happy about."</p> <p>"Oh, God," is all her brain said back then.</p> <p>"I'm not sure I can live with myself just living here," he continued, and Amanda looked at him for a moment. "I can't."
