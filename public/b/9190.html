It's a romance and a fantasy."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, baby. I've taken so long to write these," she said, smiling as she ran her fingers down the front of my legs. "How do you feel?"</p> <p>"Umm, great. I like to feel very comfortable when I am writing. My legs still feel weird after having to hike and get dressed up."</p> <p>"I'll wear a pair of my hiking shorts, too," she said, as I took her in my arms. "I'll show you my pussy later."</p> <p>There was a long moment where we just held each other and let our breathing return to normal. It was an incredibly intimate moment that was not at all like any other. I was not only attracted to her, but also very attracted to another woman, and I realized I wasn't exactly looking forward to being with other people in real life. Still, I still needed to try to find out what she was like in person.</p> <p>When finally we were done, she hugged me again and said, "I don't want to lose you," and that put a smile over my face.</p> <p>"Oh, I won't lose you. You're a very attractive, intelligent, sensitive, young woman. I think we have a lot in common." I said with some hesitation.</p> <p>"We were so close earlier. I didn't even know it was possible until I started feeling you. I couldn't help myself from thinking about it... and wondering what it would be like to have you in me."</p> <p>Again, I hesitated to be truthful. I couldn't believe this was really happening, but in fact I felt a bit horny just thinking about it for real. She looked at me as if it would be safe to say that she thought about it too. Then she kissed me on the lips again, much more intensely than before and she said, "I don't know what came over me that night. But at the risk of losing you, I was looking forward to it."</p> <p>"I have a pretty good idea," I said softly.</p> <p>"Don't stop on me, honey," she said, as she kissed me deeply once more and whispered, "And if you don't stop on me, you'll go for your own conclusions,"</p> <p>With that, we kissed again and headed back to the dormitory room in my car. Our kiss wasn't quite as passionate as the one that started that afternoon, but we managed to make sure not to let our minds wander.</p> <p>Chapter Ten</p> <p>We spent the next couple of weeks talking and touching, exploring each other in way only lovers can. We finally met in October of that year's senior year, about two weeks previous. During that first meeting, we had our first official date. It was just one night. A Saturday night in October, just after a nice dinner, on an afternoon at the University Hospital, we had been at a movie star-quality dinner with several wonderful, young men in our midst, and had shared a few words with the host and had, as it turned out, been paired up with the hottest guy there, Bill. He had made a name for himself with the fact that everyone had gone home to their wives and their roommates, and that he was a bona fide hotshot at the University Hospital, having been promoted to his position just last summer.</p> <p>A few weeks later, after we had been at the University at night all day, and after an incredible night of sex and exploration with several of his friends over a half-hour, we arrived at the University Clinic on one of the weekends at the end of one of the last periods of term, as we knew it would be. We were both in our mid-fifties, but we just figured if we did it, the evening would be great. We knew that we had a much better chance, if we went to bed together, that night rather than just driving to the hotel that night, than have all the other men at the hospital fuck us. So we agreed, just like when I had told her that we should see a doctor as soon as possible and go to a doctor. That night wasn't a repeat of the previous one, but just a regular, well-planned date.</p> <p>The day after our first night together, the hotel receptionist informed me that the appointment for Bill would be at noon. I was a little surprised when instead of seeing a nurse and making a big deal about how my husband was treating me—especially since I was his wife after all—instead of seeing a receptionist, I was being greeted by another woman. But she showed little expression and didn't even seem to notice me. We had a wonderful night together, and I was glad that I had the company of two gorgeous and intelligent women.</p> <p>The second appointment—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
