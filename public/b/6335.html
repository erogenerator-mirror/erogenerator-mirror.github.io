My lawyer had made arrangements for her to go into a relationship with someone, and had told me that if it got that bad, it would be a good investment. I didn't realize she'd been in relationships with someone since our relationship ended, and had never been very happy.</p> <p>The lawyer's lawyer was in my office on the phone while I listened to the conversation. It was almost midnight and we were going to talk at my office for one hour, since there were too many visitors for her.</p> <p>"Yes," I told the lawyer, "that's right, we are both legal so there's no need for you in court. This is going to be a real struggle for you. I've heard that your client has been acting up with you, and I don't give you a chance to answer. This is all part of the problem that's been going on for the last few years. You've got to decide whether this is a bad idea if it isn't for me asking for a divorce, and I have my side of the bargain, but if something happens, it's going to be all over town the next day. Do you have any arguments from your clients regarding this?" This brought a laugh, as he listened to the discussion.</p> <p>"I don't want to go any further but it's obvious that you're trying to gain favors for yourself and by doing so, you're losing. I know you can afford to make more than half of your money and be able to keep it, and I don't want you to feel like it's a loss. I don't think this is a good idea, but at least I think we're getting the divorce. I'm going to agree to your terms, and if you can find something that is acceptable, it's worth a try."</p> <p>He nodded to get the conversation moving on, and agreed to the terms. As it turned out, he'd had enough, and I said that I'd be going back to his office to start work on my divorce as soon as I could get it over with. When I got there, I didn't recognize the woman in her expensive dress. This wasn't part of my normal business meetings. We'd made eye contact a little over the next hour while she tried to give me answers. I found that she was a professional and an old friend, and she was trying to give me a chance to get a deal.</p> <p>When I finished telling her about us, all of the sudden it was like she was talking to a different person. I didn't know why, but it was obvious that she wanted to find out how she could have her way with me. She couldn't go that far, could she? And just as quickly, she gave up.</p> <p>The lawyer had already given me a copy of the contract and we were ready to sign. I looked at him, and he said, "I'll sign it, will you?" I said yes. The contract was very clear, and he had no trouble holding on when the subject of the divorce came up. I looked from the contracts to the papers. The papers said, "Incest and Sucking?" The contract also said that I wasn't to be divorced, and that I couldn't work in this state. "We need to discuss how long I'm going to have to stay here for," I said.</p> <p>The lawyer looked at me and said, "I know that it would be hard to stay with you while they come, but there's plenty of time. Just as long as I get to be your boss while you're here so I don't take advantage of you having an affair, and get the separation papers set up, there's also plenty of time for the divorce. I'm not going to ask you what you will be doing. The more time you get, the more I'm going to take advantage of you. Now, I've got three choices. If the divorce happens, then I'll know the judge, and if the divorce does not, then I won't do anything more until I decide with what I will. If the divorce goes out today, I'll know sooner or later, and just as quickly, you'll either be released or fired. I need to be sure this is what you want and, frankly, I don't think we'll really be together long."</p> <p>I was going to tell the lawyer to stay out of this, but decided to let it go a little while longer.</p> <p>The lawyer didn't have an attorney, but had one that looked familiar. "He's here in the conference room."</p> <p>When Mike arrived I went to get my lawyer, and the lawyer wasn't there. When I got the lawyer out of his conference room he greeted me. He said that I had one more hour left, and to comeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
