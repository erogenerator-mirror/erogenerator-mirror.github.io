I wrapped my arms around her back, feeling her body shiver in the throes of pleasure, and my face was right at her pussy, her hard clit now exposed. I licked her lips and clit as she rode me, her body shivering in her orgasm. As she rode me with increasing intensity, I felt her hands on my shoulders again, then on the backs of my legs as she bent them back and pulled my face to her pussy as she slammed me hard into her, with almost every thrust that was met with another shuddering cum.</p> <p>The two of us continued to fuck and she seemed to find herself riding me hard for her own pleasure, my dick filling her as she began to cum on my face. My hands found her breasts, holding them, and her legs closed around mine, locking my body tightly to hers. I could no longer breathe and I started moving my hips as hard as I could, pushing my cock deep into her. Her body shuddered and shimmied as she had one orgasm after another.</p> <p>She came to and sat on the edge of the bed, and began to tell me about all the things she and Brian had done on the internet, telling me the details, and how it had made her feel. We continued talking for a long time, me being fucked to orgasm but not really satisfied, until she stood up and walked over to me. When she came towards me I looked at her pussy, which still looked slightly dry from the cum that had been in it. She told me about her first time riding me and the feelings as my cock worked her clit and pussy, both of us moaning. We got dressed, but she refused the food as long as it was prepared by her.</p> <p>-</p> <p>Our lovemaking went on for an hour or so and I think that we would have fucked for hours if we had all the energy, but we weren't finished yet. When she came to me, and led me to the bed, she told me how exciting this was for me and I told her that I had often been interested in having lesbian sex and she had told her that that wasn't a problem. She had even told me that Brian liked it as well. I wondered if she had had sex with a guy earlier and hadn't had orgasms like I had.</p> <p>She didn't bother with the robe, and I was happy to see that her nipples were hard. I put the robe on once we were in bed. She reached up and held my cock, which it was hard again and had become stiff again already. We made a game of it for a while. I told her that I sometimes felt lonely and that I enjoyed it as much as she had. She had responded immediately.</p> <p>My hands were again at her tits, pulling on them. My eyes found hers first and looked deep into her eyes as she had my cock in her hand. Then I kissed her, and felt her tongue move into me, and she smiled before pressing my cock deeper into her hand.</p> <p>My hands were on her tits, my nails brushing her nipples as she started to tease me again. My hips started to move almost involuntarily, and she knew that I was ready. I started moving my hips again, and she kept up the game for a while, holding my cock in her hand. I reached back and moved my finger under her chin and lifted it. She looked at me and then back at my cock before saying:</p> <p>-</p> <p>"What we have here?"</p> <p>I told her the whole story, but kept it very light, with the exception of the fucking. She told me that one of their other customers had come in, just to see if Brian was looking for a favor. I asked her about it as well. She told me that he had been, and they had come right over and she had sat down. I knew that he could have come back, and it had turned me on knowing that he had got the job.</p> <p>I had not been in a scene like that before and told her it was probably not a good idea. She had seemed to be more concerned with us moving slowly, wanting to finish this up properly. I had been with some gay women in the past and told her that I liked watching the men fuck and that I wanted, and I had never had a gay experience before.</p> <p>Then she said:</p> <p>-</p> <p>"Do you think you could come over to our place sometime?"</p> <p>-</p> <p>She had not answered. I looked at her as if I was going to say something else, so I pulled her to me andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
