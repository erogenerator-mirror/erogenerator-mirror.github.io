He reached out and cupped one of her breasts. She put both hands on his shoulders and pressed him down, leaning back so that her tits were pushed up against his chest as he held her in his arms. She rubbed them for a few seconds, loving their feel as his hands came up to stroke and squeeze them.</p> <p>"Oh...that feels so good. I've been waiting for this!"</p> <p>He just smiled and lowered his lips to kiss her breast again and start to nibble at them as they came on hard. Her nipples were hardening up quickly and he could feel it against him, almost like it was trying to climb between them. He gently rubbed them up and down and up and down, feeling how her soft, wet flesh responded to his gentle touch. It seemed like only a few seconds could pass before she had a climax, her body shaking and squirming as she climaxed. Her mouth opened and she moaned loudly around his head as he kept rubbing.</p> <p>He released her and lay her down on her back. Kneeling down on the floor, he took her legs and pulled them back to her shoulders so she was spread open for him. "I think this is about the size that you get when I come in. You look so sexy and gorgeous. Have I said I love you?" she asked in disbelief as he rubbed her wetness just above her hood and between her legs, just inches away.</p> <p>"Not the size it's for," he said and knelt up to take her in his arms, "but everything about you will make me a very happy man." she wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled herself up to take him in her arms. "I can't wait for you to feel this inside of you," he said as his hands roamed all over her body. She reached down and started to stroke his cock, her nails scratching down the sides when he touched her inner thighs. His hands roamed all over her, massaging and squeezing her and feeling the softness.</p> <p>"What are you waiting for?" she said with a sexy moan as she grabbed his hands and pushed herself up onto the table with them. She wrapped her legs around his waist and started to feel him move around her. She had never done this before and it felt so nice, almost like she was being slowly seduced or something. He felt the wetness coating him as he moved himself back and forth against her.</p> <p>"This is amazing, I love doing this!" he exclaimed.</p> <p>"That it is, honey, but I want you to go slow," she said and started to lean into him for more sex. He held her legs while slowly moving himself in and out of her, feeling her wet flesh enveloping him. She put her hands on his chest and moved her hips to meet his thrusts. She just could feel the pleasure coming from within her as he moved deeper and deeper into her. He put a hand on her back and held her in a tight embrace, rocking back and forth.</p> <p>As he neared his end, he started to speed up more and more, slowing down to keep her in a very comfortable orgasm. He kept telling her all those things, "I'm gonna come soon," and she told him, "Just hold on, I want you to come inside of me." He kept saying this over and over again until she had yet another climax that she was barely able to feel.</p> <p>"Wow," she said, "and I like it! But I need to sit down!" she rolled over on her back and waited for him to sit on top of her. He was now able to move easier and sat up to lie against her, sliding his arms around her waist. "There, I can feel you right where you came from," she told him as she reached up to cradle his face in her hands and kiss her gently.</p> <p>"Oh that feels so good, I like that." she said as he kissed her again and slowly moved up. She put her hand on the back of his head and held him tight as she rubbed her hips against him. He kissed her neck and then her full lips.</p> <p>"You're the best," she said as he started to move up.</p> <p>"I always say that," he said and kissed her again. "But I know just what to do with you," he said before moving back down and repeating his movements. She moaned as she felt his tongue caressing her nipples, and then he was sucking on them as he fucked her. She moaned louder as she was almost there.</p> <p>"Oh God! I'm gonna come soon!" she announced as she grabbed his hair and held him against her, moaning loudly as he kept going.
