You must have been working a lot, because you’re still running late,” she mused. “I need to call in at work.”</p> <p>The sound of the shower door opening startled her, and she pulled the phone away from her ear. “Hey,” she called. “How are you?”</p> <p>She heard the bathroom door open and close, and a deep, sexy sigh.</p> <p>She felt herself grow hot. “It was kind of a long time ago,” she said. “Can you tell me about it again?”</p> <p>“Sure,” he said, a little startled by her request.</p> <p>“You’re a nice guy,” was all she could think of to get out. “I'm glad it was good for us to do something a little more.”</p> <p>“Well, good. What do you want me to do?” He couldn’t remember the last time he’d had much more than a beer, and he knew it would have made him uncomfortable. He looked down. “I’ve got one to show you, right now!”</p> <p>In the shower, his cock seemed to throb in his jeans. He watched as her long blonde hair flowed over the water as the soap washed over her body. He knew he shouldn’t be doing this, but his excitement seemed to have turned to fear. She leaned against the tile, and he watched her breasts jiggle as she shook the soap over her chest and belly, her nipples erect. He dropped to his knees, and cupped her breasts in his hands. He kissed her nipples, and she sighed as he ran his tongue over them, making her nipples rise even more.</p> <p>Her hands went into his hair, making a fist in a mass of his hair. He worked a finger over her nipples, squeezing their hardness and sending pulses of pleasure down her body. She shuddered when he pinched a nipple between his thumb and forefinger. “Oooh baby,” she moaned, as her fingers slid up his cheek.</p> <p>She grabbed his ears and yanked his head against her bosom. He sucked her nipples hard, her body trembling as the blood ran up to her groin. The water and soap seemed to heighten her excitement, driving her into an orgasm. She cried out as cum streamed down her thighs, making a puddle on the floor. He licked her nipples until the nipples were as hard as pebbles. She gasped as he sucked one nipple into his mouth, making her arch her back. His tongue found her hard nubbin and he pushed it into his mouth.</p> <p>“Yesss!” she moaned. “Suck on my nipple!”</p> <p>He did, sucking on her nipple hard, like a little kid trying to milk for the first time. He let a finger slide from her tit down to her wet crotch. He slipped it inside her, and she squirmed against his hand, feeling his finger touch her. He rolled his fingertip across her clit.</p> <p>“Ummm,” she moaned.</p> <p>He began to slide his finger in and out as she held onto his shoulders for support. The pressure of his finger caused goose bumps to rise across her skin as she felt the beginnings of a climax. When his finger found its mark, her muscles contracted around it and she cried out in pleasure. He smiled to himself, and slipped his finger out.</p> <p>His lips were right beside hers as he slid her leg down to the floor. They kissed tenderly while he helped her from the shower. His hand slid down her belly to caress her swollen bush. He pulled her close and ran his tongue around her nipple. She moaned as he blew across it, making her body tremble with desire. He pressed back against the cold tile and she held onto his head, pulling him onto her.</p> <p>His tongue dipped into her navel until his chin rested upon her mound. He spread her legs apart, and slid a finger past the lips of her pussy. She gasped when he pressed against her clit, stroking slowly up and down. He slid another finger into her wet pussy and began massaging it as he sucked one of her nipples into his mouth.</p> <p>“Ohhhh god,” she moaned, her legs wrapping around his waist, her arms around his neck, as her body began to shake. Her thighs clamped her fists into his back, and her pussy began to tremble as his mouth covered the other.</p> <p>He slid back down her body—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
