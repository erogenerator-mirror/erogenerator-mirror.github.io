What do you say, my lovely?" he asked.</p> <p>"We'd have to go to the loo then," she said, "That way they can tell when I'm going to be late!"</p> <p>"Of course I would, I'm sure they would like you..." he whispered as he leaned over the top of her, sliding his hand up her shirt to touch her breasts.</p> <p>She pushed him away, her voice soft and husky. She was breathing heavily and he felt something warm in his jeans.</p> <p>"You're a nice lad," she told him. He didn't think any more was good to be said, and he felt himself growing hard. He knew that she would still enjoy touching. He couldn't wait for her to enjoy him.</p> <p>His tongue slipped out, and he tasted her. She was salty, sweet, and his lips parted. He slowly slipped his tongue into her mouth, tasting the warmth of her tongue. His body grew warm with desire, and as he reached down to push his jeans down his legs, his rigid cock gave a lurch. He pulled her to his body, kissing her hard, his hands running over her as he rubbed the skin of her back. She pressed up against him, her arms wrapping around his shoulders to feel him against her. His hips ground against her, and she felt a wetness start to form at the back of her pussy.</p> <p>She felt his warm skin against her back, soft as silk against her skin. She had no idea what to say except she didn't want to stop at anything but what she wanted. She couldn't take it any longer. She pushed him away, lifting her skirt and slipping off her panties. There was a little damp patch on them where he had rubbed her to her point of no return. She smiled at the look of disappointment on his face.</p> <p>"Do we have to go? The others won't mind at all," she said.</p> <p>"Nah, I don't, I think it'll be OK," he replied, his heart beat hard against her flesh. Her hips were rising against his, the fabric of her skirt dampening the juices she had left inside her panties, and he could feel the heat of her cunt. With a slow motion, he lowered his lips to her naked nipple, licking her just the way she liked it. She gasped at the feel of his mouth to her, and started to rock against him. She was wet with desire, her inner muscles grabbing at his erect cock.</p> <p>"My little cock sucker should know better!," he murmured, as he pushed his head between her legs and worked his tongue inside her.</p> <p>She moaned, "Yes you should know. And I could come right now just licking you!"</p> <p>He smiled, and with a quick movement, he pulled the skirt down her hips and then she felt his hand slipping beneath her to stroke her, his fingers slipping into the dripping warmth beneath. She was so hot, and he loved the feeling of it, his penis throbbing with life. She felt his other hand holding her buttocks, his fingers spreading the cheeks of her cunt as they slid against her skin. Her legs moved against him and she felt them tighten as he finger teased her, pushing her towards her release.</p> <p>Her orgasm came very suddenly, almost violent and fast as he pulled his face away from her breasts. It was an almost painful and unexpected release, almost aching sensation as he gently pulled away.</p> <p>"That was wonderful!" she sighed as she rolled over on her back. "Mmmm, I think we will be staying for a bit longer!"</p> <p>"Of course, that's just what I wanted," he replied, "It'll have to be now, because we have all the time that could be taken."</p> <p>She lay there looking into his eyes, her body shaking with desire. He leaned down and kissed her softly, and she kissed him back. "I feel so excited and wet right now..."</p> <p>"That's good too, because I want you to be ready," he told her, "I've been looking forward to this moment for ages!"</p> <p>"But, I haven't had the chance to get my own," she sighed, "I just had to take care of you a bit first."</p> <p>"Not right now, sweetheart. I haven't had the chance to satisfy you," he said softly, feeling her body shudder with need. She was shaking now, her face a little puce, a small grin on her lips. "My little girl.
