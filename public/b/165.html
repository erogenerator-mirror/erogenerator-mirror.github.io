I feel good inside. I feel happy, very happy. It is so good to have you back in me. You fill me so well."</p> <p>"Me too, my love."</p> <p>We lay facing each other. I pulled my head back in her arms and she kissed me. It was my turn to sigh, I felt a tingle run through me. Her arm slipped around me, our heads came together with just the tip of my nose touching hers. I kissed the tip again as my nose ran over her lips from the tip of her nose to the tip of her mouth. She was breathing deep, slowly and very softly. Her hand lay on top of my thigh, I could feel her finger run lightly over it and it excited me. I kissed her again, again running my tongue over her lips.</p> <p>My tongue found her tongue and she opened her mouth for me. The tip made its' entrance and I felt as if I was going to pop my teeth in there. My tongue ran over the tip, I ran it back up. I wanted more; I wanted and needed more. I tasted it, there was more than just a taste here, there was the salty taste of her saliva.</p> <p>I felt as if I were going to jump out of my skin. I opened my mouth, my chin and lips ran over her, her tongue pushed between mine as we kissed. I was trying to keep the contact at the level of a feather; I was not going to stop there for a second but the kiss was so sensual and so exciting. Laura pulled back a little.</p> <p>"Don't be silly. I can't feel it right now. I'm just holding it in. I think we are going to have a nice, long kiss and let my tongue do the rest."</p> <p>"That is one little kiss I'm going to have tonight."</p> <p>"No, that would be too much."</p> <p>"Not so fast."</p> <p>She smiled and ran her hand down my back and then down my thigh, "I never said I was going to take you to bed."</p> <p>"I told you never."</p> <p>"You did, but I'm not done."</p> <p>My hands were on her waist; I pulled her to me, I wanted to slide her onto the bed and between my legs. She kissed me. Her mouth was on my lips and my tongue ran between it. Her hand rested on my thigh above my panties. I pulled her top off first while I kissed her and continued my hand's touch. Her hand found my breast. I was hard and erect, her thumb running over my nipple and pulling it up. The feeling was overwhelming. I lay back into the bed with my legs opened up. Her mouth and thumb began to rub my clit as the tip of her tongue ran down my lips. I was moving more and more and the sensation was getting more and more intense as the second wave hit me. My hand cupped her head, I ran my fingers through her hair as she tongued me.</p> <p>I was breathing quick and heavy, I started to push up against her. She pushed back and I got back the rest of the way up the bed. I kept pushing and she kept trying to get me up. She finally got me up and I was ready and as if a magic wand. My arms spread and went straight to her breasts, my hands found her nipples and I squeezed them and moved my head up and down to kiss her nipples.</p> <p>Her mouth left mine and we kissed and kissed, I could feel her breast moving in my hand, I squeezed the other breast and heard her moan. Our kissing continued as I felt the softness of her lips between and my fingers traced her skin.</p> <p>She was kissing me as if I were her own flesh and with one or two fingers I was in her body. Laura's breath was hot on my face as her mouth worked me. I was just thinking that she had been so good to me. Laura's tongue would run down to the tip of me and back up the lip.</p> <p>"I'm ready now. Get on top. I want to feel you on me."</p> <p>I rolled over and she was hovering above me. I put one leg up, it looked like I was going to be on the side but she was on the other side. I moved onto her and I was on my back when I kissed her again. I kissed her mouth more and tasted the saltiness of my own saliva on her lips. I licked her.</p> <p>Her tongue ran over my lips, I sucked at it, my tongue ran over it. Her tongue pushed into my mouth as if she was fucking me. I wanted her but she had other ideas; she pulled away and took me by the wrist and I followed her lead and lay on topâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
