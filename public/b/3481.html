You looked so beautiful... I just wanted to reach up and hug you...</p> <p>I didn't.</p> <p>It was my turn to start laughing.</p> <p>Then the camera stopped, and you started. I laughed harder.</p> <p>'Oh, you're the one that's laughing...?'</p> <p>'It's because you don't have on a bra...'</p> <p>We both laughed at that.</p> <p>I reached up and cupped your breasts.</p> <p>When I got to your face, I leaned down and gave you a kiss on the forehead, and then a quick peck on the lips.</p> <p>Then we resumed kissing... slowly, but as deeply as we had been.</p> <p>After a few minutes of just our lips softly touching and each other's tongues doing the same, I broke the kiss and pulled away.</p> <p>'Let's see you move.'</p> <p>And I took off my shirt.</p> <p>It really was a mess, I wasn't a very big man, but it felt really good.</p> <p>I sat down on the armchair and you climbed on top of me. Your breasts pressed on my chest as your hands went down and grabbed my belt-buckles.</p> <p>While you tried to get my belt through, you tried to unbuckle my pants. And finally, with a big struggle, my pants gave way, and you managed to get my pants undone and slid them down past my knees and off. 'Do you think we can do this slowly?' I asked you, and of course it felt good to just sit there in front of you, letting you get used to it.</p> <p>You looked down and grabbed my cock... and started to stroke it. You were smiling like a Cheshire Cat, and you looked as sexy as ever.</p> <p>'It feels like you're getting bigger,' I murmured.</p> <p>'I'm not the biggest man...' you admitted, and I just looked into your eyes and kissed you again... we kissed like that, like we knew what we were doing ... I just reached up for your breasts, and cupped one while I stroked the other with my hand.</p> <p>You moved up and sat right on me... but you left my cock inside you.</p> <p>'I want you to kiss it...' I whispered.</p> <p>'I've never done that before... but I hope you'll do it...'</p> <p>'Do you like it?</p> <p>'Of course I love it!'</p> <p>Then you stood up and sat on me and you held your breasts up with them ... and I started to kiss them again...</p> <p>You were already wearing the strap-on harness which I'd bought for you. I helped you step into it, and sat there as you looked at it. I ran my hands over the rubber cock head, then started the long gentle tugs...</p> <p>I'd worn that on lots of times before... it was as long as my wrist, but shorter. And I just loved playing with it; and it made me feel so sexy.</p> <p>Finally I took it out and turned the head... then I licked it a bit... then I did it again a little more often... and you just sat there staring at me.</p> <p>And then I got on my knees and I was in your chair. And you held my cock in one hand, and started to stroke me...</p> <p>Now I got down to those soft lips, then the soft tongue... and soon you were touching it... and that's when things got a little crazy.</p> <p>You were in my lap, slowly working on my length now... and that got you really close to orgasm.</p> <p>'I'm gonna come now...'</p> <p>'That's my girl!'</p> <p>With that, you leaned towards me so I could feel your breasts at mine, with your nipples ...</p> <p>And at that time, all I could think of was coming.</p> <p>I thought about how good it would feel to pull you up into the chair and make love to you... even better if it meant pushing my cock deep inside you...</p> <p>But you got up and knelt on the armchair, and I grabbed your hips and pulled you back towards me...</p> <p>That's when you felt that big strap-on, that's what you felt as you moved your ass from side to side...</p> <p>...it was about four inches long, and about eight inches thick.</p> <p>'That's beautiful!' I whispered as I reached down and grabbed your hips again. 'You're so sexy on film!'</p> <p>Oh it was beautiful, the way you moved back and forth, the way you pushed that thing into you.</p> <p>I reached between your legs and found your vagina, rubbing along your lips there.</p> <p>'This is so sexy...' I murmured.</p> <p>And you said nothingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
