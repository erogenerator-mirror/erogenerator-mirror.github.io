He could hear her breathing again, but she was definitely talking to him. He felt a little uneasy about her calling, but he had to be careful what he said, especially if she were even trying to call him.</p> <p>"I'll call you later."</p> <p>"Yes, please stop."</p> <p>"No, I'm very busy, but I'll be glad to see you again soon."</p> <p>"Ok... bye."</p> <p>She hung up the phone to hang up, but didn't say anything for a few more seconds. The phone was ringing again. He pressed the screen and a long, low voice purred, "I'm ready."</p> <p>He let his eyes drop to the screen and saw a picture of his mom from over a foot away. He let himself back into the house, not noticing his mom's car parked outside, until he heard more voices coming from the back of the house next door.</p> <p>"Hey, baby... you there... ready again?"</p> <p>She was standing by the pool in just a little skimpy bikini. She smiled coyly at him when he stepped inside the house. It felt so casual to call him back without saying a word to his mom. It was a little awkward getting in the house without seeing her, but he got to his knees and crawled up the two steps to the pool, taking care to give her a good, solid look at her.</p> <p>She looked up at him, her smile still a little wide, "Sorry we couldn't be here for that."</p> <p>The thought of her taking her bikini off didn't make the situation any easier.</p> <p>"Oh really?" she said sexily, turning her head to the side as she lifted her top off. She turned it back to him and held her breasts high in front of him. "Now, honey, we really have to go somewhere."</p> <p>He gave her a look of confusion at being interrupted while she thought. "We'll be right there."</p> <p>He kissed her lightly, then slid his hands down her body slowly, enjoying the feel of her.</p> <p>"Mmm... your hands felt so perfect touching me..."</p> <p>"No complaints, baby. How bad do you want to go?" he asked, taking his time, tracing her lips with his thumbs.</p> <p>"We'll never be done with either one," she replied, smiling wickedly.</p> <p>When the kiss ended she slowly let him take his hands off her breasts, kissing him on the cheek and saying a thank-you, "I hope so," followed by a long, low sigh.</p> <p>He kissed her neck slowly and gently, and trailed his hands down her sides to the bottom of the bikini. When his fingers closed around her and pulled at the tiny string it sprang out, exposing the sides of her breasts. He let his hands slip over them, slowly and caress, feeling the softness and weight of her flesh underneath his hands.</p> <p>She pushed her chest out, giving him more room. He cupped her tits again, caressing them and squeezing them through the tiny cloth of her bikini. They were perfect.</p> <p>He dropped his hands down to her hips, caressing the warm flesh as he worked his way down, brushing the sides of her legs with the backs of his fingers while he kissed the edge of her breasts. He continued down her stomach, slipping his hands under her bikini to fondle her soft, round globes. Her nipples were erect, begging for his touch.</p> <p>She felt his hands slip under her bikini bottoms to fondle and caress her ass, taking the briefest of breaks to slide his hands over her firm, smooth cheeks to give them a nice, firm squeeze before sliding his hands back up her body to caress her firm breasts further, enjoying the sensations of his hands against her skin between licks and kisses and caresses.</p> <p>She moaned quietly when he slid his hand between her thighs and lightly massaged her clit in circles. When her breathing became deeper and her back arching, he slipped his hand down and pushed two fingers inside her, finding her slippery wetness to guide her pleasure.</p> <p>They started making out and she kissed her way down his chest. When his dick was lying on his stomach she moved it up and down, trying to move him around a little to get him comfortable. He moaned and pressed up into her lips, loving how her lips felt as she kissed him all over, her hot lips against his cock. Her hands wrapped around him from base to tip and he grabbed her hips to steady himself.</p> <p>With his hand on her lower belly he was surprised when she opened his pants to slip a finger into his ass. When he pushed it in to the second knuckle he groaned deep in his chest and slid his ass slowly back and forth on his fingers.</p> <p>"Oh God, baby…—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
