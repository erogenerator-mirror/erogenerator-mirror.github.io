I started to strip but I couldn't get the panties off until my wife made me.</p> <p>She was on top of me. It felt so strange to have her weight down on me but I couldn't help myself. I just wanted her to have the full feeling. She was grinding on my erect cock. We both were breathing so hard.</p> <p>My first thoughts were, I have been with a woman, but this was just another night. Then I noticed her hand was up under her blouse and her tits were jiggling on the bed. I wanted to cum with them in my mouth. She was grinding and rubbing her crotch against me, moving her pussy up and down so I could feel her wetness. It was really exciting.</p> <p>As she reached the point of no return, she began to cum, moving her hips faster. She squeezed my cock as much as possible. Her body was now rocking and I could feel her juices on my skin. My wife was now in the same position.</p> <p>"You should probably leave," she said, "as we got up and don't want to do anything that will make the evening any more fun."</p> <p>The idea of going home with her didn't appeal to me and I got back to work until about 10:00 a.m. and when I saw Lisa in her dress, I almost panicked.</p> <p>"What?" I asked, "What is wrong with me?"</p> <p>My wife said that she was going home but she asked me if I knew how to get to their house. When I didn't say anything she was out the door and I was alone for 30 minutes and nothing happened. I went over to her place to watch TV and then I went back to my house about 6:30.</p> <p>The next day I was awake, sitting on the couch, watching a show on tv. At 7:30 I got up, went downstairs and got a drink and sat on the couch. That was the first time ever that I had been sitting around a couch. The next night I went to bed and had a good night's sleep.</p> <p>About 6:00, I heard the bedroom door open and then her voice, "Good night. How was your day?"</p> <p>"Fine," I said. "Goodnight."</p> <p>"Goodnight," she said. "We can't. I love this show and I was just thinking about getting away."</p> <p>I was upset now, but I thought, it was time for me to get on with my life. After a few days of being in the same situation, I was happy now. It just seems the only way I can do it is with Lisa. But that night, it just might be an opportunity for us two. I never felt happier in my life since, the only time I thought about Lisa was the very first time I had sex.</p> <p>The next night we sat down and finished our wine. She started rubbing her crotch against mine and my penis was already hard from watching her.</p> <p>She leaned forward when I was just about to kiss her and she kissed me on the mouth.</p> <p>"I'm going to get this thing all hard, do you mind if I do it and get that thing hard?"</p> <p>"Do you feel like taking a shower?" I said. "What do you have in mind? Want to?"</p> <p>"This could get very interesting," she said.</p> <p>She got me to get up and turn on the shower. When I came back, she had pulled her blouse off but not her bra. Even though I was wearing only jeans she asked me to come back into the living room. She sat on the couch and pulled my face toward her tit. I was a bit scared at first but she didn't say anything, then she pulled my face to her nipple. I could tell it was getting hard.</p> <p>I thought I was going to faint at first and then I heard that deep steady and sexy voice again. She continued to pull my face and I moved my hand around and massaged her other breast. My penis was straining with the need to get in to her. She leaned back and started massaging my balls.</p> <p>I was afraid at this point to do anything else. But I guess I really needed to do this. I couldn't control it.</p> <p>After several minutes of this and more than just the rubbing of her tits, she leaned back and then she turned off the shower and came into the bathroom. As she came in the bathroom door, she said, "Take care of it." She left the door unlocked and shut the door. I couldn't do anything but wait.</p> <p>After maybe 15 minutes, she came out of the bathroom with a cold shower running and said, "I'm not going to stay any longer, getâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
