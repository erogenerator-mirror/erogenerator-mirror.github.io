The man that always made me a woman, the only man that loved me the way you love. I am in love with you."</p> <p>"Oh honey you are in love with me, you are in love with the best man I ever wanted."</p> <p>"But I have never had anyone I loved besides you."</p> <p>"Just like that, sweetheart."</p> <p>"We need to go again, baby."</p> <p>"I can't, the baby is sleeping. It is too early for him if he is not here. If he is still here I have to go to you, I have to be out for hours."</p> <p>"Baby, let her go. Don't you want her back?"</p> <p>"Yes I do. I want her back."</p> <p>"But I want you back, sweetheart."</p> <p>"But nothing, I could never go back and I want you back. "</p> <p>He looks a little disappointed.</p> <p>"Baby don't be sad. This is for you, baby."</p> <p>"I know you do."</p> <p>"I know everything I want, but she is not coming back."</p> <p>"I am going to do it, but I promise I want to do this. I just want you to know it is not about you. It is about your beautiful baby. I still love you and I want to love you for as long as I can. I do not want that to change, and I would just like to hear your decision."</p> <p>"So, sweetheart, do you want to stay here?"</p> <p>"Yes, baby. I want to stay with you."</p> <p>"Okay, now you have to do this."</p> <p>Cameron looks at her, is she kidding or not? I was worried she was going to run. I am so worried.</p> <p>"Come on baby, tell me the truth."</p> <p>"Okay, I want to be here when she leaves."</p> <p>"Just let her have time to get here. You are going home. I am going to take a shower. We will talk in the bedroom."</p> <p>"Okay sweetheart."</p> <p>Cameron goes back to the bedroom. We make love again, that is her choice. She goes back to talk to her sister and she sees Cameron. She just smiles at her. She tells her sister she is coming home because she wanted to be around her first. She tells her that she is not going. She says she loves Cameron dearly. Cameron walks back to me and kisses me on my lips.</p> <p>"You better go now. That is not my job until you leave. She and I know each other. She loves you as much as she will let him love her. You can stay if just to talk. If you are sick or tired of her, you can stay home with her."</p> <p>"I will love her no matter what you do."</p> <p>"And when she comes home, we are having our first child."</p> <p>Cameron calls her.</p> <p>"Cameron, can I talk to you?"</p> <p>"Sure sweetheart, but we better not be in bed yet."</p> <p>"Baby, can I tell you something?"</p> <p>"Of course. I want to hear it."</p> <p>"Will you marry me?"</p> <p>"Oh yes baby, I will marry you."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"I love you."</p> <p>"Love me no more."</p> <p>"You can never be enough for me."</p> <p>We do get back to the room and get back to the wedding.</p> <p>The ceremony starts and we have both been crying a little. We hold each other as we go into the front room. We sit down on the couch and cuddle.</p> <p>Cameron and I are holding each other in our arms. We can feel how good we each feel for each other. I hug Cameron closer and kiss her. I can feel her lips on mine and the light of her hair against my cheek. My hand moves to her breast and I start to feel her nipple. My hand moves down her body stopping on her panties and down and down. She can feel my hard on and then she can feel it through my jeans and jeans. We look into each other's eyes and smile.</p> <p>Our tongues touch and she is surprised by how sexy she is feeling. She kisses me, pushes her tongue into my mouth tasting her own juices and tasting herself. I taste more. We continue to hold each other as we get hotter and hotter. I want to be with her forever. Our love grows and I feel it between us inside of me.</p> <p>I go toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
