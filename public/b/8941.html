I bet they would love to see your feet." I tried to sound sweet.</p> <p>"What? Why me? I'm your sister." She was so sincere I almost giggled.</p> <p>"Actually I'm a really great teacher and a nice kind. I can do a few lessons for you if you want." I was trying to get out of it but she was smiling so I smiled back.</p> <p>"I don't care if your hands are covered. You know I really wouldn't mind seeing them." She seemed real sincere.</p> <p>"I really don't mind at all. I'll drop by." She called my cell and it was 9:30 already. "I'll drop in here first."</p> <p>"Thanks. I was hoping you'd be here."</p> <p>"No, I'm sorry I'm really looking forward to seeing you again. Call me when the weather gets warm enough."</p> <p>"I think I would too."</p> <p>"That reminds me. I'll call in to go get a seat."</p> <p>"Yes that would be nice."</p> <p>I left the house and made sure everything was in order. I went back to my car and drove to the hospital in less than 15 minutes. The nurse was already there so I asked if she wanted a seat. I went to the chair and sat down.</p> <p>She looked at the doctor and they both gave me thumbs up. They had noticed me sitting so they both had smiles on their faces so I started.</p> <p>"What can I do for you today?"</p> <p>"I wanted you to talk to me about what happened." I could hardly get it out.</p> <p>"OK. Let's go, I think I got it."</p> <p>We got an interview and had talked pretty much. She looked the part of a parent. She did everything for me. She helped me understand what happened in my life and gave me advice on how to keep myself from taking that step. She made me feel safe and loved again. She even came a lot to chat with me when I got angry. I told her I wasn't sure I could look at anyone else.</p> <p>She told me she liked me and I was a friend. That made me feel safe. To be sure she was right when she said that I was a good student. I told her I wasn't sure I could be a good student but I would try. She told me she didn't think I needed to see her again.</p> <p>"Well after today, it's a date then. But I like you. I like you too much."</p> <p>"That's true. I still am really looking forward to going to the party again."</p> <p>I was shocked at how much that sounded like a date.</p> <p>She got up to leave so we hugged. "You have no idea how many times I've wanted to feel like that the rest of the night."</p> <p>"That might be the only time you're dating again. You're special to me, I'll always be in your debt." I kissed her cheek then she gave me a quick kiss and left. I couldn't really talk to her but I could always make up some bullshit story while we were together.</p> <p>"That was great."</p> <p>"Really? That's a first for me." I smiled at that and she smiled back.</p> <p>"Yes. I had my hands full with your sister. If I had had any doubts about how I felt I would have told you. I couldn't have handled it better."</p> <p>"Really?! That's awesome!"</p> <p>"Now that I know how you felt, I'm gonna have to make up for that. I've had a lot on my mind while we were together and I'm really trying not to ruin any chance for you."</p> <p>I felt so good talking to her again. "I like it too. I'm the one in control here. It's like a new relationship, we just have to go with it."</p> <p>She just kept smiling so I could see why. I couldn't help myself with those dimples and she kept flashing them. She was so beautiful. She had light brown hair cut very short. Her face had the same light skin color as her eyes. She had full cheeks. We didn't talk about the party or anything else the whole time we were there. We just talked and laughed and talked till dinner time, all in the space of an hour. The whole time her eyes stayed locked on mine and they had that sparkle in them that I got when looking at a woman's body. That sparkle was like having the lightest candle in the universe.</p> <p>We still had the time on our hands and the first thing I did after the first course was get a nap. It was really sweet seeing her smiling so much.
