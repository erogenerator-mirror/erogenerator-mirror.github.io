There was no sign of any activity. I went to my room, went to bed, and did not sleep. I had missed all the activities happening during the night. I fell into a fitful slumber, but did not wake until mid-morning the next day. I looked over at the wall clock, and saw it was 9:40 AM. I decided to watch a few TV shows, and then take a big bath. I wanted to take out my frustrations, but was going to watch a nice movie.</p> <p>When I got out of the tub, I saw the living room sitting back, with a bowl of cereal in each hand. I walked to the fridge to open it. The bowl was empty and I did not notice what was in front of me. I walked to the table and pulled back the bottom of the bowl. There was another bowl of cereal, but this bowl was a bit shorter. I reached in and found another bowl of cereal. A good portion was in front of the bowl. Then, I opened it and reached inside for another bowl. I reached inside a bowl for an extra large container of cereal. I walked back out to the living room with the next bowl, and was again surprised to see another bowl. I started to eat, but could not. I reached my next container and reached into another container.</p> <p>I reached for more cereal and found another bowl. I took the last container and put another in front of me. I looked at the last bowl, and there was a large bowl next to it. I picked that bowl up again, but had no success with my empty spoon. I grabbed the spoon off the counter and reached for the other spoon. It was still the same bowl, but a slightly different angle. I looked at the countertop, and saw a small bowl, with a spoon, also in front of me. I reached for the spoon again and this time got a huge bowl, but only reached for one spoon. I looked at the counter top again, and saw that the spoon was about two inches from my mouth. I reached for the spoon, and took another spoon, but this time got a large spoon. I reached for the spoon again, but found another spoon, this time reaching for the entire contents of the spoon. I could do with another spoon, and put the spoon in front of me again. I pulled the spoon closer to my face until it was touching it. It touched my tongue. My head jerked up. It did not fit in any of the bowls and it still had the same odd spoon. I opened the container again, and reached for the spoon again. It was an odd spoon, but I did not want to be close to it, but it looked like it could have fit in the bottom of the bowl. I reached for spoon, pulled, and brought the container back to my mouth. I opened the container and reached into another container, this time with a spoon. I took the spoon into my mouth and took another spoon out of the other one. I brought one spoon to my mouth and started to eat one spoon. I did this over and over, until a spoon was full like me. I finished the third spoon, and put in a third, with as much water as I could.</p> <p>The door was open a bit, and I looked in to see that the door to the kitchen was open about half way. I heard moans, but could not make out the sounds. I looked in to see that the hallway was in the basement. I went upstairs into the kitchen and peeked in down the hall. There was a couple laying down on the couch with various sounds coming from above them, with their asses in the air with their legs bent up in the air. I put my foot on the stairs, and walked down the hallway to the basement room and looked in.</p> <p>I went down to the bottom of the stairway. It was pretty dark, except for the light from inside the basement room. I could see a couple feet down. There was movement above the couple, who was apparently in the middle of a blow job. The woman was sitting with her legs up in the air with his head between her legs, as her mouth hung down on his cock. The other man on the couch was kneeling in front of her, and she was slowly rubbing his cock in her hand as he licked her pussy. My cock twitched when I saw everything. I felt my cock swell up, and it poked against the inside of my robe. I wanted to stroke it and feel it, but I knew that would get the other guy hot. Instead, I moved out of the way and sat next to the couple. I moved my hand to my crotch to show my hard on to them. The woman, sitting in front of him, put both hands around his cock and pulled it in between her legs.</p> <p>"Oh, you big cocksuckerâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
