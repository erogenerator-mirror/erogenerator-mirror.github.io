She wanted this to go on forever, they should go on.</p> <p>She knew what he meant, and he could take this as long as he wanted. Then she would move into his arms.</p> <p>She was almost breathless, trembling as his hands gently kneaded over her breasts. When they finally reached the middle, he gently pulled the flannel away. She felt the softness of the sheet slip, under them. He gently caressed her shoulders, then her breasts with a soft touch. He lifted her left breast slightly and kissed her nipple. She gasped and bit her lip to stifle a squeal.</p> <p>"Oh, I can see the idea of this is very tempting."</p> <p>"You're too...and it feels so good."</p> <p>"And so do I."</p> <p>He lifted her right breast and kissed a trail down across her areolae and across her belly. She squirmed, squirmed, as he ran his tongue across her navel, through the thin strip of hair, to the crease where her hips met. She tried to wriggle away, but he was on her and her moans echoed off the walls of the cottage. He kissed just the inside of her thighs, then he kissed her down the middle, leaving a hot trail of kisses over her body. Her eyes closed and she licked her lips, as her tongue sought his. He nipped her and she gasped.</p> <p>She shivered as his teeth closed around her nipple. She reached to try to pull his head closer, but he reached out and grabbed her hands, pulling her firmly back to him. His tongue found her belly button again, and she felt herself shudder.</p> <p>The fingers of one hand began roaming all over her belly, the other one gently caressing the back of her hand. She could feel heat growing between her legs. His tongue ran along her thighs and over her hips, then up her abdomen, stopping briefly at her nipples. The sensations were so erotic, so wicked. Her breaths came quickly, almost imperceptibly. Her juices were dripping down her slit.</p> <p>He pulled up from her breasts, her eyes opened to meet his, a big grin on her face. He brought her hand over to his cock and stroked the shaft. When his hand moved to her sex, she could see the expression on his face as he slid it over her swollen clit...then up inside her. She was so wet she was dripping.</p> <p>She felt his tongue darting between her legs, around her and onto her lips. She was ready, but not just yet. The tip of his tongue danced around her clit, and she gasped again. He flicked his tongue across her clit and felt her body jerk. He held his mouth firmly to her. He felt her body thrash against his face. He heard her moaning and groaning. When he heard her gasp as he pulled away, she was panting, her body quaking.</p> <p>He felt her shaking with it and pulled him up to her. She felt herself flush, and her hands stroked his face.</p> <p>"I think you need a second to recover," she said. They both laughed. Her eyes were shiny with tears, and she licked her own juices off his lips.</p> <p>"So are we a team nowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
