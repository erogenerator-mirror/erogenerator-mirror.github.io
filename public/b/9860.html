"No, I'm here! Don't you stop!" Her fingers slid down his neck and back up his chest, leaving a trail of damp, silky goosebumps, and her body began to shake. A deep moan escaped her lips when they pressed into his neck.</p> <p></p> <p>"I want to fuck you!" The words seemed to spill from her lips, but her hips continued to rub against him, her body aching for his to fill her.</p> <p></p> <p>"Please. I'm on the pill. Please fuck me!" She gasped, "Please!" Her hands were pushing up his shirt and her lips were on his chin. As they began to kiss and rub each others body against each other, her thighs parted and her mound rubbed against his crotch. As they continued, she opened her eyes and caught an intense gaze of lust and desire in his, which made her hips press against him and her body quiver with desire.</p> <p>He pulled away from her lips long enough to say "You're beautiful," before returning both hands to her, pushing up her shirt to expose her breast through her bra. She moaned when his tongue touched her aching nipple and she closed her eyes and moaned again as those lips covered her other. "Is this what they say in porn movies?"</p> <p>"Don't stop." His hands slid over her hips and up her thighs until he came in contact with the hard shaft of his erection.</p> <p>"Yes!" She gasped, "I want to feel you on me, yes!" She pushed out her hips, "Fuck me!"</p> <p>"Mmm," He kissed his way down her stomach, "yes, I want this!" He kissed his way lower and lower, kissing at the bottom of her mound, causing it to quiver.</p> <p>"Oh! God, you drive me wild," She groaned, "I want you!" And she thrust her pelvis forward, "please!" She opened her eyes and looked directly at him, "do it!!" His hands left her hips and came up to her front, where he pulled down her bra and kissed it across her right breast. Her hips began to sway as his mouth closed over her nipple. Her hands moved to his hair and then to his head. She wanted him to take more of her nipple into his mouth, so that she could feel its softness on the tips of her lips.</p> <p>Kissing her lips with his, he drew one of his fingers between her teeth where it had just slipped down her stomach, just barely touching her navel. "Do it, now!" he said.</p> <p>"Yes, please!" She gasped.</p> <p>His tongue slid forward and swiped across her left nipple while his finger traced its way back down to her mound. He pushed it forward and she felt its tip slip between her lips. He began to rub the tip of his penis against her clit, which became hard and engorged as it neared its peak. He moved his fingers to her lips and he spread them so that the tip of his penis was trapped between her lips. Feeling it begin to press hard against her, he slid it up over her clit.</p> <p>"You can't..." And his mouth closed in, sucking her nipple between his lips. The sensation was almost too much for her to bear. As his penis pressed up against her clit in the midst of rubbing the tip up and down it, he reached up and ran his fingers through her short hair. He wanted to take his time and make it last, but he loved the way she felt. She was so wet and the contact sent electric jolts through his groin. He wanted this to last.</p> <p>Kneeling between her legs, he slid his hands toward her, pulling, kneading her breasts. He was trying to prolong their time together, wanting to enjoy the feel of her body. His head moved toward her again, but she stopped him. "Don't move." She said.</p> <p>He moved his body away from hers so that he was right in front of her, with his hands still cupping her breasts. "You really seem to want me." He started to move downward, his hands still on her. She felt as though she was going to drop and his penis may have been pushing her body down. He moved down her body until his face was on her thighs.</p> <p>"What the fuck are you doing?" He asked, "What if I pull out again?"</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"I just want to feel," His lips were close to her pussy, "to feel what you felt yesterday, yesterday and the next day." He reached out to gently caress her clit before sliding his finger up to her lips and sliding it in and out of the wet heat that was spreading from her pussy to her thighsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
