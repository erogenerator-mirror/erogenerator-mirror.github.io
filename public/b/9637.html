He was walking down the stairs as I approached so I figured he was watching us. He didn't seem to be in his stride but he had a big smile on his face and his eyes twinkled as he greeted me. For just a second I felt a little uneasy but I knew he could have just ignored me, but he did so well. He walked directly to our elevator and turned it off as I walked up to my elevator to join his. There were people waiting to get in for the ride up so I didn't bother to get on my elevator as I waited for the next one down. When I got to the eighth floor I stepped up to the elevator and entered the first floor.</p> <p>A woman waited for me and looked at my watch as I walked by her. "How far up?" she questioned.</p> <p>"Just down the hall," I replied.</p> <p>"You sure are punctual!" she said with a laugh. "What happened to you didn't happen to me," she asked with a smile.</p> <p>My face turned red but I nodded my head. "I think I may have gotten caught."</p> <p>"Well, you sure didn't get caught! You're going to have to hurry home if you want the chance to fuck tonight!" I could almost hear the laughter as she said that. "I think you could use a massage. Do you want some?" She asked and I nodded as she walked away.</p> <p>I quickly looked around and grabbed my keys as my feet left the elevator and I walked toward the street. The street looked like a cemetery and I thought I could follow her if she was really going to get around. Her place did look like a cemetery and I knew I would find her there. Once I was in her apartment I went out to the street and found her door slightly ajar as was the usual way for people in her neighborhood. I quickly unlocked the door and let the latch down as she looked out through the window. The curtains were closed and the light still on but it was mostly bright from the streetlamp outside. The woman had come to her apartment door and was going to be waiting for me in the living room. I opened up the front door and stepped outside with her. Her door was open and she waved me in.</p> <p>I walked up to her and she handed me a bottle of massage oil. I took and used a second bottle and poured some on her hands and her skin. I looked at her face and could see the concern in her eyes. "Are you ok?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm fine," she replied. She must feel better now. I knew there was no need for anything. I smiled at her and she smiled back. "It was a long day. Come have some champagne and bring me a glass." Her eyes were still wide with worry and even as she spoke I saw that she was still upset about something. I poured a drink and we sat on the sofa with my arms around her neck. I could feel the warmth of her body next to mine and I could feel her nipples pressing on my shirt as they were hard with arousal. She handed me the glass of wine I offered her and the glass was quickly filled. When I got to the bottom it was empty. She took my glass back and placed it down on the coffee table and turned toward me. "What did you see, you naughty man." She laughed as I sat next to her.</p> <p>I took the glass of wine in my other hand and reached out to take her hand. She slowly lifted her fingers to my lips and I gently sucked on her fingers and she sucked in my breath. I smiled and said, "I saw that and I liked it." I pulled her toward me and she took her lips back to mine. I started kissing her slowly and she responded very well to my kiss. Our tongues began to probe each other and she moved her hands to my waist and I reached down and found my hard cock. She immediately stopped kissing me and held me tighter as our kiss increased in passion. I looked at her and she had a smile on her face, but the look in her eyes made me realize that she was really hot.</p> <p>"What are you thinking?" she asked as she broke off the kiss.</p> <p>"I think we both were looking forward to it," I replied smiling. As I did I looked over at the kitchen and she was standing looking over at the sink. I stood up and we broke our kiss and I turned toward her. She turned toward me with a look of lust on her face that I had never seen before. I pulled her to me and kissed her softly. "Take off my tux and make it yours," she said with a smile.</p> <p>I did as she asked and she leaned into me again and she pulled her feet up on the coffee table and put herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
