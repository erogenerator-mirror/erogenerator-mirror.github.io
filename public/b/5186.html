'Are you?'</p> <p>'I guess. You didn't seem too much of a threat to me. We'd both like to be married.'</p> <p>'Well we certainly aren't going to try and marry.'</p> <p>'Oh, I'm sure you'll have your chance. I'm a woman of many talents, and I would like to have a lot more of it.'</p> <p>Laughing she said: 'You must have known how to do that, but I don't know you like having a lot of sex.'</p> <p>'Is that what a lot of it is?'</p> <p>She laughed, and said she did.</p> <p>After a short kiss I said, 'Let's go home first. You and I haven't even had our first drink.'</p> <p>'Then let's go home,' she said quickly, and she and I hurriedly left the bar.</p> <p>The taxi driver gave us a puzzled look as he slowed the taxi and gave the driver a twenty. I gave him a five and he made the turn towards the town centre. We could see that we were going to a small house that was on a cliff top in a small, well lit street. A door was leading up to it, and we could hear the sound of people laughing as I made it into the house. As we walked across the street I gave my hand to her, and we went up the stone stairs, and I led her down into the bedroom. She was still wearing her t-shirt and shorts, so I undid her belt and pulled the waistband of her jeans down to her buttocks. I pulled her shorts and panties off at the same time and they hit the bedroom floor, followed by her socks and shoes. I led her back to the bed as I undid the button and fly of my jeans, and slipped them down over my shoes. She didn't seem as concerned in undressing as I had thought she might have been, so we lay on the bed and kissed each other. She had a lot of experience kissing, and this time got me rock hard.</p> <p>I knelt on the bed as she lay back and I pushed my erection into the space between her thighs. I felt her thighs relax around me, and when I pushed my cock back into her I could feel the heat of her vagina, and my cock sank inside her. We were both breathing heavily, and I held the position for her long after our bodies had adjusted to each of the sensations we were experiencing. I held her firmly, and I felt her relax her hands onto my back as I eased it in and out. She had the kind of softness and elasticity only real lovers can have, and I was not at all surprised because we had been together for quite a long time, and the sensation of her wetness around my cock made me feel very proud.</p> <p>I was also surprised because I hadn't been in her for a full time and even more so now we found a rhythm. She was making the noises I liked to hear because that's how she liked them. She was saying, 'Oh, Simon, that's lovely, it's lovely! You make me feel so good!' as she squeezed my cock with her pussy.</p> <p>I just wanted to hold her there as I pumped into her and we started to make love slowly, our pace gradually increasing. I lifted back the bedclothes and pulled the bedcovers off, covering us with the bedsheet. Then I sat up and said: 'Lie on your back, Jane.'</p> <p>She did, and I took her in the classic missionary position, with me lying back on the bed with her on top of me. Our kiss was so hot it made me dizzy, and I held her with my hands on her beautiful body.</p> <p>I said, 'I'm nearly there.'</p> <p>'I'm sure, and your cock is all stiff inside me.'</p> <p>'You can be sure.'</p> <p>'It would seem that. But don't worry, I want you to do me as well as you can. I was quite eager to have you inside me.'</p> <p>'You did very well.'</p> <p>'It's very nice,' she said. 'I loved it when you used to fill me up, but it doesn't bother me.'</p> <p>'It doesn't bother me too much that you're so pretty.'</p> <p>'Thank you. It would be nice not to have you have to say anything about that.'</p> <p>'We'll sort something out. I think we have been making love a lot longer than we should have.'</p> <p>We started to move our bodies in a figure eight, and the whole time I was talking to her, she was moving with me. Her movements were so sensuous and sexy, I almost came right there on the spot. She must have liked that, because her movements became more and more insistent.
