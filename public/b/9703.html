"We're going to take you to get some more ice."</p> <p>"Yes, that's right," Jahn said and grabbed a handful of ice. He followed the woman in back of her to a small metal device that was on a table.</p> <p>"It's called a tumbler. I'm sure you don't remember?" she asked the man who held the tumbler. He nodded his head and opened the tumbler and began to remove the contents from the container.</p> <p>"What the fuck's this crap?" The man said. "I thought you said we could use it on a ship."</p> <p>The man started tearing into the water, pushing it off the back of his hand and forcing the water back to the tumbler and then pushing it back onto the man. He then took off the tumbler and held it in his hand. Jahn could see the woman watching Jahn closely, and she was giving Jahn a knowing look. The woman seemed to sense something.</p> <p>"The ship might be a bit larger than its base," said the man. "But we can't do too much damage. Do you mind?"</p> <p>Jahn shook his head, taking the container. "This is going to do wonders for my head. I'll be okay."</p> <p>The man stood up and left the room.</p> <p>"Come," said Jahn, grabbing Jahn's hand and leading him through a corridor. Jahn stopped at a closed door that Jahn did not expect to see. The man had left it open. Jahn reached into the small cupboard beside the door and pulled out an old looking tube with silver wires and tubing attached. Jahn opened the door and entered the small room that Jahn now called a "till death if" was in the room.</p> <p>"There's more than enough room," said Jahn, pushing on the door handle. It slid open and with a wave Jahn disappeared into the room.</p> <p>"Is there a doctor in the room?" asked Jahn as he walked up the narrow staircase that led down to the waiting room downstairs at the hospital.</p> <p>"No, not that one, but I'm sure we'll be able to manage this," replied the woman, who had entered the room next to Jahn who was sitting on a couch and was watching him with a knowing smile. The man was standing in the doorway with a clipboard.</p> <p>"This is Doctor Anderson. Does he have any more questions for you?" asked Jahn.</p> <p>"Oh yes. He said he needs to be released from duty. Do you wish to release him?" the doctor said hopefully.</p> <p>"No, that's fine," Jahn said. "You said you were ready to release him, but he told me that he needs an examination to determine how long this will be."</p> <p>Jahn turned around in the doctor's chair and leaned forward, putting the clipboard back down on the floor under his feet. The doctor stepped in front of Jahn, then walked over next to him and sat down on one of Jahn's legs, next to him.</p> <p>"This will be a standard procedure Doctor." Jahn handed the clipboard to the doctor. "Is he alright?"</p> <p>The doctor looked closely at the doctor's face and nodded. "He's fine." He walked over to Jahn on the couch and sat down next to him. "Is there anything else you need before we file everything down?" The doctor asked, his voice a bit calmer now.</p> <p>"Yes, that's right. What's with all those bags?" asked Jahn.</p> <p>"Do you want to help me find the container?" the doctor asked.</p> <p>"Sure," Jahn said. "I'd love to help you with that."</p> <p>The doctor's hands slid up Jahn's leg, onto his waist, brushing his erection through his slacks as he reached for the container.</p> <p>"I'll need to call my father in from work," said Jahn, still not looking directly at the doctor.</p> <p>Doctor Anderson nodded her head and turned to leave.</p> <p>"I think I have a better idea," Jahn offered.</p> <p>"I'll leave you alone," said the doctor. "Mr. Hutton, I am Dr. Anderson," he said, extending his hand to Jahn.</p> <p>Jahn took the handshake.</p> <p>"Dr. Anderson," he said extending his hand to each of the other doctors present.</p> <p>"Very well, Dr. Anderson," the doctor responded, "now let's see if we can use this container to get some of this ice. Can you go ahead, sir?"</p> <p>"I'mâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
