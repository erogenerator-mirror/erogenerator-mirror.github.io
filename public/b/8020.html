She sighed, her hands falling to his shoulders so that he could slip the shirt over her head now. He kissed down her neck, trailing kisses up and down in a figure eight pattern, his hand drifting down between their bodies, finding the tiny strip of fabric, and gently tugging at the strings. She moaned, and her body shifted in response. She felt him touch the fabric with one hand, pulling it free, sliding down over her stomach to caress her inner thighs.</p> <p>She arched her back, allowing him to pull the strip of cloth aside, then spread her legs as he leaned down to kiss her. The soft lips, pink and delicate, welcomed him and parted so wonderfully. The scent of her desire burned into his nostrils, and he felt a quiver spread out his body in response.</p> <p>She had felt his hands on her breasts, gently pinching her nipples, and had never felt so alive. His mouth never left hers, and she let her head go, savoring the pleasure of him kissing her, teasing her.</p> <p>It took her a long time to decide what to do. She had never felt as alive and powerful, as she felt now at this moment in time. But she made a decision that he couldn't. He had to give in for more. She was certain that if she asked, he would have. So there was no going back.</p> <p>The fingers between her legs felt like a steel bar, hard, and straight, pressing into her core, drawing tiny gasps of pleasure that he could not contain.</p> <p>He kissed her ear, then slipped both hands down to her thighs and under her panties. She tensed, when he touched her clit. He could feel her body, shuddering. He licked her ear, then, his fingers slipping over her clit, slowly, feeling the softest skin that he had ever felt.</p> <p>She didn't say no, not for him. No whimper, no protest, just a guttural gasp as his hand found her clit, and began to stroke and rub. Her clit felt as though it was bursting. And she was on edge. No one had ever touched her there. Her breath came out in a hiss, the breath of air that had been held back from her lungs.</p> <p>He kept his hand between them, his fingers still stroking her.</p> <p>Her body betrayed her in this moment. She closed her eyes, feeling the wetness against her thighs. Her body, her core, was alive, and ready for him.</p> <p>Her hips began to move, and he moved his hand back, pulling aside her underwear so that his fingers could continue to tease her. His hand moved to her clit, and she jumped, surprised. He smiled as she opened her eyes. She found his grin encouraging, and pressed her hips back as his fingers stroked her, touching her all over.</p> <p>"Please," she whimpered, still unable to find the words to talk, "please, now."</p> <p>"Shh," he whispered, and slipped a finger inside her, pushing into her, slowly, gently, as her hips bucked against him. She felt his other hand press against her back, and she realized that his cock was hard. She wanted it in her, but she didn't want to make him wait.</p> <p>She raised herself up on her hands to let him slip the panties off her hips, but he wasn't done, teasing her again. He lifted up her legs, holding them in each arm, and moved himself between them. She couldn't believe her body could react so to him at this moment. So close. She felt the heat, the pressure building in him, her breath coming in gasps. He moved himself closer, and she let the head of his cock touch her.</p> <p>She felt his fingers touching her, moving slowly, but firmly, feeling his length, pulsing in her. She felt herself opening for him, felt the heat building. He slid himself deeper, deeper, until they were touching at her core, where there was no room for him to go. And when his cockhead rested against her, she felt the warmth. Her eyes fluttered shut, and she felt as though her body was on fire, as though she were alive. He pressed himself in, and she felt every inch enter her, felt the tight hold of his cock.</p> <p>He slowly rocked back and forth, allowing her to adjust to the feeling. He felt the taut muscles, and it thrilled her, the way her breasts pushed back, hard against his chest, the way his hands moved over her. It couldn't last. She had never felt so alive, so completely aroused, so utterlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
