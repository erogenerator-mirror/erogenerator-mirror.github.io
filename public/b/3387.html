I wanted nothing more than to show him, but I didn't know how to bring myself to do that.</p> <p>He reached behind him and grabbed his ring and threw it into her hands.</p> <p>"This isn't a wedding ring," he added, "It's a wedding ring."</p> <p>"Really," I said, "That's sweet but don't do it." And I knew by now that he understood.</p> <p>But, it was still difficult to leave the church; I kept thinking about our next steps:</p> <p>"But," I started again, "If we could just agree that our marriage is special."</p> <p>He nodded. "It's what you're thinking. Marriage means the same thing for me." He put on a smile and added, "And we'll be married in twenty years, after we make all our arrangements."</p> <p>And he was right.</p> <p>We sat and talked for over an hour before he got up to go to the bathroom. I got up to join him and we went into my office. As I sat on the edge of the desk, I wondered if he was reading the bible and had he been on the phone the whole time. Finally, he came out of the bathroom and sat on the end of my chair. He had been holding it in for a minute or so before he realized what he was doing and leaned back.</p> <p>He smiled big and reached out a hand to me and I stood, giving him a kiss on the lips, saying: "I love you." But then I turned to go out, leaving him with a wail on the steps.</p> <p>He was quiet as I left and turned to go back to his office. And there he was! Not even a hair! It was just like he hadn't been told, like a picture, like his wife's picture of God.</p> <p>I came out a few minutes later to see that he was done and had the coffee ready. He got up to leave and asked me what I wanted to do the next day. "I've got to find the right day to marry David." And then I realized I had a lot to think about too. I went ahead and talked to the neighbors. We did talk, but I said little more, and he didn't say much. I thought it best for us to go shopping, and we were both so hungry and so tired and we couldn't help but laugh that night.</p> <p>***</p> <p>"The problem is that we both know you're too young to be our son. And we're really worried that you might come down with something."</p> <p>"I know. And we're going to have a really good time as a couple," I told him. I couldn't say I loved David as much as I loved Katie, but I knew he'd be proud of the fact that he could get it up a lot. And that was what all of this was about. We could share our joy.</p> <p>"There is that," Katie replied and added, "I love it." We were on the way back to the apartment; we had more to talk about then and would be together a little longer.</p> <p>*</p> <p>When we got back to our apartment and went into our bedroom, I didn't know what David was going to say. When he didn't say anything for several minutes, I asked:</p> <p>"What is going on with that girl, and if I should be marrying her?"</p> <p>"I just don't know yet," he said, but then he looked pointedly at Katie. "She's going with him."</p> <p>The look on his face told me I've got to be a bit curious. "And where is she?"</p> <p>"She was at the bookstore, shopping." And just as an idea crossed my mind it occurred to me. "She's out back. I'll ask her if I can borrow her phone or something."</p> <p>"Sure," he said as he reached into his pocket and pulled out a cell phone.</p> <p>I didn't know what to think, so I just thought I'd go in and ask Katie if she was going to be able to borrow her cell. But she didn't say anything, so I went to take a shower and go to bed, figuring if anything like she was doing I may as well get in myself. David was so hot that he probably hadn't known how to go from getting his dick sucked to letting the woman of his dreams use him. And he didn't mind getting a girlfriend. What's more, I thought he probably knew how to ask good and pretty girl's to take a load up their ass and fuck and suck and be good. He wasn't going to complain that I was gettingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
