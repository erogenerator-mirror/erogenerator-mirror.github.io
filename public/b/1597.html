I decided to go home and grab a light lunch instead of coming back into work. But I was never coming into work tonight after this.</p> <p>I wasn't going to go home.</p> <p>I knew that that if I tried, I'd be in trouble, and a little more than just trouble would be more than I could handle.</p> <p>As was to become a regular part of our sex lives, we had both been doing several affairs, the first with each other, then with another woman. I had found another one that wasn't about her, had found another, but still wanted to give it to both us.</p> <p>I had been hoping to get the chance to be with her, but she said that she wouldn't be very long.</p> <p>I told her, "Okay, I guess that I'll be back in here in about an hour. Why don't you come home and get some dinner and go out and celebrate, then we'll get to know each other again here on the sofa in the living room."</p> <p>With that I went out and sat in the office, making a point to sit facing away from everyone else. It felt good to be home and to finally have a drink and to be back in my life again, without the worry of another relationship happening - or so I thought.</p> <p>About 45 minutes later, I was back in the living room with three empty glasses.</p> <p>"Are you guys still in there," a voice asked from outside.</p> <p>I turned to see a woman dressed in a business suit, one side of her suit jacket lying back against the sofa while another half sleeve covered her hand. The sight was even more beautiful than before, and I was definitely going to enjoy her company.</p> <p>"Yep, we're still in it. How long have you been sitting behind the desk?" I asked, moving the glasses to a new holder within hand.</p> <p>"About 10-15 minutes," she whispered.</p> <p>I said, "Come on over here and sit beside us while we finish our drinks."</p> <p>With that, she began to unbutton her blouse.</p> <p>"Wait," I insisted. "You're not going to just sit here," I said, indicating for her to pull it away from her skirt.</p> <p>She paused, but continued.</p> <p>"That's the spirit. And that's what I intend to do!"</p> <p>"Do you really want my company to be our secret?" she asked.</p> <p>"We have an arrangement," I stated. "Now, let me help you get your clothes off."</p> <p>As with the night before, she dropped the blouse on the floor, and stood before me in her matching half slip, bra, thigh-high stockings and matching panty.</p> <p>I leaned down and kissed her on the lips. She kissed me back with much passion, and our tongues were soon wrestling with each other. Then my hand went under her skirt, and I could feel the soft softness of her skin. She stopped kissing me and said, "Now this one thing we need to try, is for us to pretend it never happened. We're not supposed to be so wild, but it feels so nice. I just love the feeling of your hard cock pushing up into me. How can we pretend never happened?"</p> <p>I stood up again, and she took the opportunity to take off the rest of her bra while she continued to kiss me. Again, we ended our kiss, and then she pulled the bra off, leaving me standing there with her bra covering us both up. I took a step forward, and then stepped back out of my shirt. She did the same, and we made our next fast transition.</p> <p>I looked at her breasts again, still clothed in their clothing, but more or less bare. She sat down on the sofa, and then said, "Hang on a minute!"</p> <p>I went into my bag for some of my things, and then I went to my purse and took out a small bottle.</p> <p>We watched each other undressing as I took a seat in an empty chair. I had to put my hands between my legs as I watched, fascinated.</p> <p>She dropped her panties off at my feet and I stood to remove mine. Then I helped her to her feet, stood back away from her, and then said, "I don't want to make you nervous. There's something else I want to try."</p> <p>She leaned over so that her head was resting on the side of the sofa, and she held out a hand for me to help her up. Then she took my handâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
