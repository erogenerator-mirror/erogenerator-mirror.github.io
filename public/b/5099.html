I had a little while before I left to make us dinner. She's not a big cook so her cooking is always good." He says as he walks over to his truck.</p> <p>"Okay I'll keep the beer and steak warm. You know what I need right?" I say as I walk behind him and take the cooler he left in his pants. I take his pants for him and put them on and walk out to my truck. We are off. "Hey what was wrong? You don't look good." He says smiling at me.</p> <p>"Nothing, it was the wind it was the moon light." I say smiling. "The moon just took its hold of me and it took over everything." I say as we drive. We stop at the corner shop for burgers. We order and walk inside. We just sit and talk. I am really starting to like what we talk about. After the hamburgers, we continue to talk about the movie we watched so far. We walk over to the couch. I sit on his lap. He is still holding one of my hands, not letting go of it.</p> <p>"Well let's just see what I can come up with." I say as I lean up to kiss him. He pulls me closer and we kiss. I wrap my arms around him and kiss back. We kiss for what seems like hours, but it has only been a minute or two when he breaks the kiss.</p> <p>"Damn I want to do more." He says as he walks back into the bedroom and lays on the bed.</p> <p>"I can help you." I say standing up. He reaches into the night stand and pulls out a bottle of lube. I get on top of him and use his hand to stroke my pussy lips. "I have to wait just for you to come back and make me come too." I say as I slowly slide all the way down his cock till I am sitting on his pubic mound. He moans and holds his hands to the side of his head. "Are you ever going to get enough?" I ask him as I start to ride him.</p> <p>"It's been a few days and it feels like days as well." He says as he holds his hands in the side. I look down at him as I ride him and see that his eyes open and closed.</p> <p>"Damn my pussy's been running with juices too." I say as I slowly rock myself back and forth on his lap driving my pussy hard on his cock. "Oh god I'm coming again." I shout out as my orgasm runs through my body like nothing else. I slide myself off of him in order to ride him again while the lube works it's way down. We fuck like that in about fifteen minutes each of us screaming out in ecstasy at the feeling.</p> <p>"We still have a few minutes to go." I say as I take a deep breath and get off my husband's cock to turn around to take it in my mouth. I bend over and take the head of his dick in my mouth, trying to get it as far into my throat as it can reach and I can barely get the head of it in my mouth. He has his hands on either side of my head and he pushes into my throat. I keep taking his dick in as deep as it can go until he is all the way in. Then I pull back up and slide down his shaft while sucking on the head. I slide back down his shaft, taking him fully inside again. Then he pulls me to my feet and grabs the front of my bra. He starts to pull the straps down while pulling my tits out from under it. I let them drop to the floor as he pulls my tits back to the center of my chest. He then takes my nipple in between his teeth and bit down hard. He then pulls my tits together in a circle and bites my nipple, which sends a bolt of electricity straight down my body and I feel as if someone on the other side of the room has grabbed my clit and was rubbing it while he bit my nipple harder.</p> <p>"Do I have your permission to enter you?" I say in a little girl like voice. He just groans and moves his hands under my ass cheeks and brings his fingers down below my pussy and runs over it. Then down into my ass. "Is that permission that you ask?" He asks again as he begins to finger-fuck my ass again.</p> <p>"Come here." I say in my slutty voice as I come closer to him. He stands up with his dick still in my mouth as I straddle him and slowly take him inside. He then grabs my tits and begins to pinch my nipples. His cock is still in my mouth, so I don't really know what his hands are doing.
