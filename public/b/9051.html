He watched, then grabbed his gear, then headed to the steps onto his path. He wasn't in much hurry; he had made up his mind about what he had seen. For the second day in a row he'd seen someone he wanted to marry, but couldn't.</p> <p>A man was just out, but they'd been out for about twenty or thirty minutes, so he'd started to relax, then remembered his plan. But before he could say anything, he was pulled into the bushes out in the open. He'd been nervous a bit, but decided to just sit down and put it in. He pulled his eyes away as, a moment or two later, the man was pulling out and down his steps to them. Not looking at him, but looking directly into his eyes and rubbing his nose. He turned his head quickly to the side and said, "Hey. Can I get you something to drink?"</p> <p>"Yes I am fine. I was just going to swim to the water. I'll wait. Just sit for awhile and get a beer and whatever is available."</p> <p>He smiled at her and saw the smile and blush creep back onto her face. She had a sort of little smile that appeared to match the color of her eyes. Just like the night before, when those eyes had appeared, he hadn't just sat back, but was kind of leaning back on his haunches to sit there. He watched as she started to move to the water. Her eyes were sparkling as she moved to the waves and began swimming away from the shore. When she had reached the bottom she stopped and looked back at him. In a few moments, she was standing there in the very same spot he had taken her. Her hair spilled over her shoulders and her eyes were sparkling while they looked straight and serious. They were looking straight into each other's eyes and she held her hand out to him. He held it and looked at her for a second before nodding and sliding his hand over hers. She took his hand and he felt something between his cheeks and looked down to see his hand being rubbed. Her hand looked even hotter as she brought his hand over hers and his fingers were slowly running over her cheek and neck. He watched as her tongue poked out of her mouth and slowly moved down from her mouth. As she was taking his hand and pulling it between her lips, his fingers had moved up to just lightly brush up over her breast. That just made her smile even more. He smiled and turned back toward the trail that led down to the water. The sun was just beginning to shine into the trees. Then she had moved back down to sit down on the dock a bit and looking over at his face, she said softly, "I'll turn around in another moment. What... what about your car? How long... how long do you think it will last?"</p> <p>He took his hand out from her and held his hand up between his fingers. He watched as she took his hand and placed it back between her legs and began to rub it against her again. The little smile she had on her face as she watched him touch her had him smiling again. He thought he could actually do it again. He reached over and lifted her chin saying "May I ask a favor?"</p> <p>He had to have her. Just like in the other day he saw her eyes widen with anticipation and he slowly moved his fingertips up over her cheek and smiled when she closed her eyes. He had wondered what it would be and had hoped that it would be some kind of sexual thing, but what had he gotten himself into.</p> <p>He heard her breathe deeply when she saw the look of joy and excitement in his eyes, then she saw him staring at her and her smile just got larger when she saw him reaching up and running his fingers down along the side of her chin, just below her eyes still closed. As his hands moved lower, her eyes opened and she looked at him for a second then closed her eyes again again. As her mouth slid open again, they closed completely. The look on her face, the words he had heard all those weeks before, she was looking into his eyes again. He had never been that aroused sexually before in his short life. It was like electricity had been pulled from his body and he almost lost it right there.</p> <p>With one arm still around her shoulders, the other hand began working on her breasts. She closed her eyes again and he saw just a hint of her nipple, already hard and erect. The hand on her left breast was moving lower so that he could feel the nipple between his finger and thumb. Slowly this time, she held her breath whichâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
