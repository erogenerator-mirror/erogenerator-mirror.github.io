He found it quickly. He picked up the two bowls of stew and set one at the table. He pulled the spoon from the oven and began to stir the stew, slowly working over his dinner.</p> <p>He turned on the television not even realizing he had brought an audio player. He flipped through the channels and found only porn films on the tube. He picked up the television and hit a few buttons. Music began to play. He turned to his left and found his dad looking at him and then on his right.</p> <p>"Dad?"</p> <p>"Yes, sweet talker."</p> <p>"When?"</p> <p>"It happened."</p> <p>"I'm not sure I will be able to stand it tonight."</p> <p>"Dad you can go. There isn't a thing on."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"You know the way I like to eat, I am going to throw these on while I go get a shower and change."</p> <p>"Alright dad."</p> <p>He picked up his pants and went to bed. He turned out the lights and went to sleep and dreamed of his dad coming home. He had missed his dad's company but never did call back.</p> <p>When he looked back into his room he realized they were both asleep. He got up and went to the shower. He had no one to spend soaping him and he was beginning to lose it. He took of his shirt and the shower door opened.</p> <p>"Hey dad."</p> <p>"Good morning sleepy head. I thought I better talk to you about last night."</p> <p>Trying not to wake him up, he got under the shower and cleaned up. He came out and turned on the news channel.</p> <p>"What happened."</p> <p>"What about it?"</p> <p>"Dad, what happened about last night didn't happen. We never did anything like it."</p> <p>"I know you didn't. I am sorry that I would make you feel bad. I am your dad."</p> <p>"I know." he said as he began to pull the water up his body. "I love you dad. It was a good night."</p> <p>"I know but I don't want to do that to you. I am going to take the shower and get ready. I am leaving the door to this room open a crack."</p> <p>"Okay dad. I'll see you when you get out."</p> <p>He had no idea what to do next. What was he going to do? He tried to make up his mind and his brain would just fail. He got up and stepped out of the shower. His skin was so wet it was making him sticky. He took of his clothes and walked to the large closet that housed his office and went inside it, pulling out a towel and tossing it on the closet chair. Turning on the small lamp on the dresser he made his way out of the bathroom. He stepped into his father's arms and let himself fall onto his dad.</p> <p>"I love you."</p> <p>"I know. I know. We will have to make the right decision."</p> <p>At that moment nothing else mattered to him. Nothing else existed. He pulled out the tie and began to remove his dad's shirt. He pulled away and was about to do it but stopped and looked at his dad. He looked so handsome, so strong and it gave him comfort, strength. He began to remove his father's shirt and as he tossed it out of the way, he saw his dad looking at him with awe in his eyes as he unbuttoned the shirt from his waist. He took his shirt off and stepped out of his pants and put his shirt back on. They looked at each other as he put the shirt on.</p> <p>"God." he gasped before he started unbuttoning his dad's pants. His own hands felt so strong. He took the pants off and threw them onto the back of the chair. He could tell it was tight against his dick. He took his boxer's off the back of the chair and slowly he pulled them off his brother's feet. His hands ran over his brother's legs as he felt his dad get aroused. He walked over, pulled his father's dick out and took it in his hands. He slowly licked the precum off of it as he slid his tongue along his way around the head. Slowly his father's dick began to get hard. He wanted that dick up his ass. He wanted it in him. He took his dad's dick into his mouth and began to lick up and down the length of it. The pleasure was beginning to take the form of the cock's pleasure. He took in his father's hard manhood as he worked it to the point of stopping and then taking it back in. He wanted it back in his mouth like it did his dick before.
