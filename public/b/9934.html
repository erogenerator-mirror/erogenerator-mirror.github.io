But you can take your pick of any of them!"</p> <p>"And besides; you are the only one. And no matter whose birthday he gave me, I'm sure he's going to let me spend the whole one week in the tropa. There are hundreds of people who I'd like to see with the exception of the very handsome and wealthy Mr. Gentry."</p> <p>"Alright, maybe I shouldn't have mentioned that. I can't imagine he would go for that."</p> <p>"Honey it isn't a big deal. It's just a day to look forward to. I don't think a lot would matter if I was with any other guy."</p> <p>"Why is he asking about you?"</p> <p>"Well, I was just thinking it might be nice to see him again so that I can get some alone time."</p> <p>"I'm sure that you would spend a lot of that alone time with him. The first time that you went out with your guy would be at the prom or something with you and, if he were in the mood, she would dance all the way around him. Or we could go and get some cocktails and just forget it happened."</p> <p>"You haven't been kidding yourself. But you know what? It wasn't that much of a thing really. I got a part time job at the school next door and a couple of weeks later that Mr. Gentry invited us to his house."</p> <p>"He said that this was just an excuse to dance or hang out. So you would dance with him every day if he was here. If any of those things happened then you would at least go home with me to your dorm."</p> <p>"No, I'll tell you what I am sure. He is a nice guy. But the idea is just not something that I could do or even want to do. I don't know how he would take to me as a woman for not being more than twenty."</p> <p>"Well if you are going to come over, you may as well go to a room with him. It will probably be the last thing he ever sees before one of us leaves."</p> <p>"But what if he's my neighbor or someone close by that he would like to talk to?"</p> <p>"Well, if it would upset you that I'm not around, then he would probably ask how I got myself into such a position and if you are anything like he is. But if there is someone I'd much rather talk to then I would just go home with him. What do you think?"</p> <p>"What kind of a situation is that you have created for yourself? And do you know what kind of a mess you are making?"</p> <p>"I think that is the kind of mess that I would usually have. Not the kind of mess that I would expect to be made by one of my clients."</p> <p>"And why is that?"</p> <p>"I'd rather you didn't come over right now." In the end, I had to agree with that. "It would seem to me that you may have your doubts. But I think you have something that you are going to have to get over with before you can begin to get to know him better."</p> <p>"So what is our deal?"</p> <p>"It's up to you; it is my job to make sure you don't fall for anything that you don't want to do and I know it can be a lot of work but I can assure you that I am not going to hurt you."</p> <p>I told him that I would let it go at that. "It didn't actually change anything between us, we haven't gotten to that point. Things will just have to go back to how they were before and that can go on. That is all that I'm saying."</p> <p>"But it doesn't have to change anything between us."</p> <p>"You are not going to get that. I would expect that you would do what I would expect if the situation actually would develop between you and my client. I know that you would try to get away from him, but if he was a gentleman and asked you to be his wife, then you would have no problem accepting his offer."</p> <p>"So just let it go and when you are done; I'll let you go home with him. He can't get away from me."</p> <p>"You're right. We won't be the same. It will be just about the same."</p> <p>"When I say that I just want to remind you that I know how you feel about him."</p> <p>"No I know not."</p> <p>"That's good.
