Her right leg spread in a wide 90 degree split, as she looked over to see her hand was busy touching the inside of his thigh. The fingers of her other hand were pressing slightly into the soft skin of his pubic hair, as she slowly massaged his cock in a way that was both a challenge with the control she was giving, and a delight at the pleasure she was having as she watched his reaction to her hands.</p> <p>She couldn't really see what she was doing but that didn't stop her hands being able to explore all around his crotch. Her fingers ran across the top of his cock and up over the shaft making him shiver as the tips of her fingers caressed the head of his cock.</p> <p>Her eyes moved down, across his stomach taking in his cock and wondering about the size and shape of his testes. His cock had not gotten hard as she had anticipated, and she thought about her own husband with his hard prick in hand as she fingered herself.</p> <p>She couldn't believe how much of a turn on it felt when he was hard and the more when he did when she touched him. She hadn't imagined it happening all that frequently in real life and even now she was enjoying it. She had even admitted to herself that the thought of her husband with an enormous prick and balls excited her. Now it was her fingers that began to roll and tug on her nipples, a sensation that started from her clit through her nipples, and her fingers moved on her nipples again, in a most sensitive place.</p> <p>She couldn't really tell how much she liked it at that moment, the sensations felt wonderful to her, but at the same time felt like they were being held back. How long before the real thing happened, or could she just stay in the heat? The excitement that she got was growing and she couldn't wait to experience it.</p> <p>In the moment she felt the excitement in her eyes she felt so vulnerable, so out of control, so very vulnerable, that she didn't care about anything else but the rush through her system that caused her body to feel weak and weak, and that her heart pound as she moved a hand up and down the length of her cock.</p> <p>Her fingers were wet with her juices now but it didn't bother her that much. A finger dipped down into her hole, then back to her cock as her head dropped back in ecstasy. The feeling didn't last long.</p> <p>"Mm..mom...you're feeling a bit uncomfortable," she mumbled as she moved her finger back to her clit, and pushed her middle finger further into herself.</p> <p>"I don't mind...I won't," she told him, as she closed her eyes and her head laid backward as she enjoyed just being a girl.</p> <p>She couldn't help it. It felt so good to be with him, she just couldn't do that to her husband as she imagined what it would be like to just masturbate for him all night long. To be with someone else.</p> <p>She opened her eyes again at this point, but this time it was so quiet; then she felt his hand reach around from the back and find hers. She looked up into his face. His eyes were closed and she couldn't tell if he was smiling, or his body was tense with anticipation, but it didn't matter that she couldn't tell either. She didn't care.</p> <p>He felt her finger enter her cunt as quickly as she'd slid it inside; it hurt slightly at the first part, but she was still so tight she was surprised she could even pull out. Her fingers moved back to her clit and her hand went back to her cock.</p> <p>"No, I think you're really starting to feel it, aren't you?" she told him, as she moved her finger faster.</p> <p>"Yes, oh yes," she breathed as she reached an immediate climax as he finger fucked her and he continued to rub her button.</p> <p>"Let me feel how it feels," he said and reached down to put his hand back in front of her.</p> <p>He wasn't gentle. It was a long slow finger fucking. Her fingers were going crazy as her orgasm built, and she couldn't take it back when he pulled his finger away and she exploded in her own orgasm.</p> <p>He removed his finger and she lay there quivering in her own orgasm, her legs shaking a bit. His finger slipped out of her cum soaked hole, as she caught her breath. She tried to catch her breath as he pulled her off the bed, and guided her into the bathroom to clean herself up. Her legs were still shaking.</p> <p>"You have been really hot," he said to her in his deep, sexy voice.</p> <p>"I'mâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
