I just knew it!" she said.</p> <p>"No, you don't. I'm just not going to sleep." I said with a sigh, realizing the need to tell her something that was very important.</p> <p>She smiled. "I have a surprise for you." She said. "I'm going back to bed and I'm hoping you are too tired to do anything. I hope to see you after I get up."</p> <p>"I'm not going to be anywhere near that close to 'done'. I'd want to sleep with you, you know." I said.</p> <p>"I won't have to go to bed in the same pajamas." she whispered, her eyes closing.</p> <p>The alarm clock went off in the morning, and I awoke to light coming through the windows in the room next door. I looked over at her. She was standing there with a large smile on her face, reading her book. She was getting off of her bed and getting into the shower. The day was not going according to plan. I turned to leave and she stood there.</p> <p>"Don't get up." she said, smiling.</p> <p>"Huh? Wait! What? Oh, uh, no way! Get on the couch." I asked, realizing our conversation was getting a little too serious.</p> <p>She laughed. "Don't stop doing what you were doing and I won't stop you."</p> <p>I stood there. "What is your schedule like?"</p> <p>"Okay you see, I have a new job coming up and I need to finish the same thing that took my last three months apart. So I figured I'd get the job finished and then come home and see what the new schedule did for the rest of the day." She said, grinning.</p> <p>"Wow." I said, still confused. I turned on my own shower and got up and began looking through the closet in the apartment.</p> <p>"Don't feel too bad about the apartment. You have a nice place, I guess." she said. After I had showered and dressed she came in and took my hand. "Come with me." She said, holding the door open in my direction.</p> <p>As we walked we stopped in front of the refrigerator, opening it for a second. "You didn't think you could let me do what you did with your roommate last night? It was fun. Maybe I'll do it again." she said.</p> <p>I walked behind her, putting both of my hands on her and caressing her. "You have a nice body. I'm not sure if you're ready for me..." I said.</p> <p>"Me neither!" she said, laughing. "I've been wanting you every day ever since those pictures. I told you, it would be okay." They were both laughing, and it got me going again, but I had no intention of ever getting close to her again.</p> <p>We began walking back towards my place, her hand sliding down my back, down into my lap. She began to rub my shaft and balls, causing a small moan to escape. "My turn to kiss you. What do you say?" she said, taking my hands in hers, lifting me up. We kissed again, this time more passionately. I put my arms around her, her breasts pressing against me. After a moment, she broke the kiss.</p> <p>"Let's go on back." she said, taking my hand and leading me back into my apartment, which she pointed to when we arrived. She got me the key and went to the refrigerator, picking out a couple of fruit, which she put the fruit in and brought back to my apartment. She opened the door.</p> <p>"Here's what we're gonna do." she said, putting a fruit in front of me. As I stared at it, she pulled down the zipper of her jeans. "I got you something to wear, but it'll be just your top. It has a thin line, but it's the right shape to wear. How about this one?" I watched her take it from her hand.</p> <p>"Oh my God you have a gorgeous ass and I could just love to touch it. You can even take it off. The only one that can do that will be you. Come on, I'll show you." she said, picking the bag off the bed, and pulling me to my feet. She handed me a turtleneck, which she tied around my neck, and tossed it across the room. "It's just for tonight, I'll just change into something more comfortable." she said with a laugh.</p> <p>I was beginning to harden. While I really appreciated her choices, it was still the one thing I enjoyed every day. And while I didn't have to think at first about it, she seemed to have other things inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
