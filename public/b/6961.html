"It's alright, you can get in the car now!" She helped me out, and we were soon on our way.</p> <p>I parked, walked around to the driver's door, and rang it. Once inside, I opened the trunk, and as she did this, I could smell the sweet aroma of her arousal, and I suddenly became concerned!</p> <p>"Where are we going?" I asked. We pulled up to a very rundown looking building, and she followed me to the back, which was an entrance to a garage. I rang the doorbell again, and this time it raised my eyebrows.</p> <p>"What?" I questioned, looking around "Oh my God!" she laughed.</p> <p>"We are on our way to what? A hotel?" she quizzed.</p> <p>There was a slight hesitation on my part - what? She knew? But then, she just had to say something. That's it!</p> <p>"It's alright dear, I guess we are here. But first, we have got to do something."</p> <p>"What?" she looked around, obviously thinking about something - even though she was already there?</p> <p>"Come on now, don't be shy, I've seen you in action before in the bathroom, too. There is not much to do here! And besides, if we went to another hotel then I am assuming this one is available. Come on, it's okay! You are here!"</p> <p>I followed her into the building, and as soon as we were inside, I ran back to the trunk and knocked the bell again. She gave me a puzzled look, and opened the door to the garage.</p> <p>There was a large room filled with tables, and chairs, and a long narrow bar. A door off the center was the only entrance to the room, so we quickly took that as our cue to approach the bar, while sitting on a couch. We immediately sat down, and before I could ask for any more questions, she pulled the straps off my shoulders so that my hands were free.</p> <p>"What is this?" she asked as she leaned back and smiled.</p> <p>"It really is not as hard as it sounds", I said.</p> <p>"Okay", she nodded, "This is a massage parlor, you see."</p> <p>I followed her eyes to the left side of the bar, and could not believe the incredible sight I found - my hands were now on my thighs, as they moved in small movements, looking for all the world like someone's hands were actually running over my skin. She smiled as she stared at the mannequin, which was attached to a ring on the back of it, and it's movements were almost as though the mannequin was actually running his hands over the entire body of the woman.</p> <p>I felt so incredibly vulnerable, so embarrassed in front of her, even if the feelings of arousal still burned deep into my body with every breath.</p> <p>"Now, dear" she started. "Let's begin by just getting you comfortable, shall we?"</p> <p>"Oh, no, of course, I am not trying to escape from myself or anything."</p> <p>"You see me with my body?" she asked with a big smile. "And I'm all yours now, right!"</p> <p>Her eyes were on my breasts, which were now pushing against the front of the blouse, and the way it was already tied was so incredibly erotic. They seemed to want to come to my nipples.</p> <p>"No, no! Let's sit back." She began to massage her hands up and down my shoulders and arms with her thumbs, then I felt a tug on the collar on my blouse a couple of moments later, bringing me in closer. The feeling of her hands on my body made me nearly lose my nerve, so I just sat there, watching the woman on the mannequin.</p> <p>She leaned over and whispered to me. "I was going to take your hand once it was in those gloves. Now, would you really like for me to take your hand in mine and..."</p> <p>Her hands slowly slid away, and I felt her fingers sliding under my fingers and through my fingers as she took my hand and placed it in her own.</p> <p>"I don't think you understand", she whispered again, "We both have to get to know each other! Don't you?"</p> <p>I smiled as she did so, and began to wonder.</p> <p>"What do you think? Do you really want to? You can't tell me you're not curious."</p> <p>I shook my head. "No, no, not really. I mean, you know, I can get out of anything I do in the back of my mind, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
