It had become such a turn on to be waking you up with my tongue licking your asshole. Before I knew it, my dick was hard again. I got up to get some breakfast and I heard your car start up and drive away. I got up and went into the living room to get some clothes for work.</p> <p>I went into the bathroom where I kept the last of my dirty clothes. I went to the guest room, went through the drawers, and started getting dressed. I came back into the living room and you were getting ready for work. I went back to see you and took my shirt off and threw it in the hamper, then I had you slip into your new uniform. I put it on and started to work putting things away when I saw your cock, fully hard and ready to go in a split second. I started to stroke it again and when it was at full mast, I bent over and took it in my mouth, tasting your sweet cum on my tongue as I slowly started moving my lips back and forward on it. You started to moan on every thrust of my mouth. Soon you came in my mouth, which just made me even more aroused.</p> <p>You put a new uniform on under your shorts and went back to work, I think that was the best night of sex you had ever had all year.</p> <p>When you left the house that night, you went to bed and got all excited. I lay in my bed for a few hours getting turned on by the thought of sucking your cock again, but I was still hungry and you had to leave the next day. I felt sorry for you and the night you left. I had been thinking about the previous night with your cock all day and it made me feel good. I got to work and got myself started on work, thinking of the pleasure you gave me that night at your house. It really put me into a good mood. I finished my first shift.</p> <p>The next morning, I was still horny and decided it was time to make my move on waking you up with that wonderful piece of manhood you have. However, I had to get back after work and start doing some shopping again, so I went back to your house.</p> <p>When I got back to the house, you hadn't gone to work. I was surprised when I walked up to you and went and kissed you good morning. We both said thank you for the good morning kiss and then kissed some more. It was a feeling that would never be forgotten. We both had a smile on our faces that I was not sure if we were going to keep on our professional relationship.</p> <p>After a night of making love and talking, I decided to head up to my house for the night hoping it was finally over. You got in bed as you usually did when you were horny, and got on top and started kissing me so I could taste myself on your tongue. You started to finger my pussy while you went down. Soon, I had my first orgasm, when I felt you cum on my tongue, I licked you as your cum entered my mouth. We had all our clothes off and soon we were passionately making out, as our tongues went back and forth, exploring each others mouths in a hot French kiss.</p> <p>As this story is heading towards a conclusion, I want to take your advice to know that you still think about it, and would love to take you for myself. I love to give you sexual pleasure to your heart's content, but I know that there will always be a line I cannot cross. I could never do a better job of teaching you. Also, when you come to your senses, just enjoy what you just experienced, if that turns you on a little, go into a bedroom. You just enjoy this part of you.
