It would be easier to drive again that way, she reasoned, than drive at the same time when the traffic was less than a hundred yards away. Once Patti began her conversation with the old man in her peripheral vision, he seemed to take her aback for a moment, but then he was back to the chat, chatting with her about some of the upcoming business. The conversation was easy now. His easy-going nature had kept him from taking too much time off the road. Patti had a suspicion about his driving skill, but she was not surprised to find that he did not even talk about the trip with Patti's parents. Nor was his talk with the old man really exciting. Patti was beginning to have trouble focusing on the conversation, and was beginning to lose the focus of her thoughts. She was getting used to the conversation but she was still getting used to being told what was on her mind. She could feel herself beginning to slip into that moment of calm, that calm that she had enjoyed while talking with Paul. She was suddenly concerned. She decided to be nice.</p> <p>For what seemed to be an eternity, Patti tried to steer the conversation with her son. Her interest and excitement were becoming less frequent. Her mind was getting confused. She worried about what was in front of her face.</p> <p>The conversation turned more to sex and her pussy began to react as it normally did. As she tried to be witty with her son, she felt her heart begin to pound and her thighs begin to quiver. She was losing control of the conversation. Patti had never been this nervous before. She had always been comfortable with sex, even if it had always seemed so personal. But tonight it seemed so personal. She knew that if she tried anything with Paul, he would be suspicious. Would he be suspicious of having sex with her? Or, would he just turn her down and then send Paul to an empty room. Patti was starting to believe the old man thought that she was attractive. Maybe he thought that because she was a woman, it seemed to make her sexier and sexier. Or perhaps it was because she had had sex with the man she loved, but for some reason Paul hadn't had sex with her. He had just been a chauvinist pig.</p> <p>After several minutes, her thoughts wandered back to the conversation. She couldn't seem to convince herself that she was trying to give a rousing speech. She just knew that she had wanted to talk about the trip. She couldn't quite bring herself to go on at a faster pace. She knew it was wrong, and she could easily avoid it. But she couldn't.</p> <p>She had been talking to Paul for several minutes, and Patti had felt a kind of resignation. She tried to calm herself down, but her mind kept racing. She thought it would be all right to come home and crash with her husband. She could go talk about the trip and let him have some fun with her and forget about their troubles. The old man would probably come back at least a dozen times, and maybe even bring his wife back a little older. The idea of him bringing her to an empty room, or making love to her naked, excited her. She had never wanted to get married, but it seemed to fit with her plan to have this conversation over a coffee break anyway.</p> <p>Suddenly, she felt herself tense, and she knew that something was wrong. She couldn't believe she had just had sex with her son, just talked about it with her husband and actually did that. She quickly dismissed the thought. She knew it was wrong. The guilt kept her from realizing that what happened in his hotel room wasn't that. She was angry that it wasn't over, but at the same time she wanted to move on with some sort of marriage. She knew that her marriage had been badly broken into, and she knew that she couldn't stay married and live her life the way that she had.</p> <p>It wasn't going to be as complicated as she had hoped. But at the same time it would be wonderful, and it would be so far away from her husband that she didn't want to know what she was experiencing. Patti had been with a few other women before, but she never, ever imagined that she could be with a man and be all manly. She was sure this would be an experience. It would be a pleasant experience. What difference could she make, she wondered? But she couldn't stop thinking about her son. She couldn't stop looking at his face, his body. She was becoming overwhelmed with thoughts of him. The thoughts of their earlier chats, the conversations about the trip, the talk about sex. Patti had almost thought that her son would be sexually interested in her, but she felt he had little interest in her. She knew that he wasn't interested in her, but she couldn't see how she could ever go on havingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
