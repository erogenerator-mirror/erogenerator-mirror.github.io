Just don’t expect something that scares you at all.”</p> <p>A long time had passed and we had been kissing and feeling each other. Just when I thought she was ready to go on it began to feel weirdly strange and I wanted more. I reached for the top of her panties to pull them down and she lifted her hips in the opposite direction. I had no underwear on and she was neatly shaved, except for a little tuft above her pussy hair. I kissed her briefly, then stood up and pulled her to her feet. It seemed like forever, and as she stood there looking up at me, I found myself wanting her more; but I held myself back. I’d never been like this with any one of my girl friends, but it was something I wanted. When she looked at me with those sparkling green eyes I was overwhelmed with a desire to feel her touch me, to be with her. A part of me wanted her right then, to be with her just as she needed me.</p> <p>The first thing about how much I wanted her was how beautiful she looked. She had dark hair, long and full and just beginning to fall on her shoulders; her tits were small and firm and just a little larger than my handful, so there was a certain appeal about her. I also felt a connection to her, not just physically, but that I could be with a woman. I loved her as I always had and I was not surprised when I found that the attraction I felt was for her, not me. Maybe that was because it was the first time I felt that way about someone in real life. As I was trying to decide what to do, she made her decision for herself. She picked up her panties and held them out to me.</p> <p>My immediate response was to put them on. She looked at me with a curious expression and stepped into my arms. I held her tight and our kisses became more urgent and forceful. She wrapped her legs around me as we kissed, then her hands reached down to stroke my cock through my briefs. After a few minutes she pulled back and looked me in the eye. Then she looked at my pants and her eyes changed and her face lit up again. She smiled at me, then reached down between us and began to unfasten my belt. I was ready to burst as she pushed my shirt over my head and stepped back, leaving me naked from the waist up. She knelt in front of me as she looked down at my naked body. She looked back up at me as she reached with her hand to cup my balls and she lifted the weight of my shaft up and then down toward my belly. My cock was hard as it had been the first time I ever saw her and she leaned forward and kissed me, the fullness of her lips touching mine. Our tongues twirled as our hands caressed one another. She pushed me back so I could step out of my shoes then she knelt on the chair to sit in before me, her knees on the floor with her back toward me. I stepped in between her open legs once I stepped up and leaned forward to kiss her again. Her arms around my head as I drew her closer to me. She held me tight and her head was moving slightly from side to side as her eyes locked on mine. My hand found her breast again and kneaded her nipple between my fingers. I was aware of her gasping when I began kissing her neck and she opened her mouth even wider. I kissed my way down her lovely neck to her magnificent tits.</p> <p>Her nipples were dark, hard and swollen, and the hair there was as dark as the hair down at the knees. I gently kissed one then the other and I continued on my way down her stomach to the top of her mound. She was clean, hairless and almost completely dry. I took a long slow lick from her clit to her opening, then back again and this time as an invitation, I reached up with both hands and pushed her legs open. With her eyes, mouth and mouth opened, she looked so wanton that it surprised me, but I thought she felt it just at first. As I tasted her for the first time, I was aware of her body responding to my efforts. With her hand between her legs, I felt her hips rocking under my mouth, her clit pressing against the roof of my lips which was like a butterfly. I had a desire to taste her and to make her come, but not just yet – I was—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
