But I also knew that if you didn't trust Sam in any way, then you would do the same, even if you didn't want anything too crazy. And when he found out I'd been fucking one of my classmates, well my ex-girlfriends, and had given him a blowjob, well, that was a total disaster.</p> <p>I was starting to get angry with myself for allowing it to happen like that. I was sure that if Sam saw the way I had treated her that I would never forgive myself for it - and if I did, maybe that would change.</p> <p>A couple moments later the guy's car pulled into a quiet and empty parking garage at the far end of the lot. When the car stopped and I saw the guy get out, I jumped to my feet and backed way. I walked over and grabbed the guy by his arm by his neck, pulling him across the asphalt and yanking him towards the back of the car just as I heard a voice behind me say, "Wait, wait, wait!"</p> <p>The whole thing seemed really scary, so I just went back to my car and locked it up and took my bags inside and went back to Sam. I was surprised to find he was already on his cell phone, and, after some hesitation, I opened it up. "I saw your car," I told him. I'm sure even I knew what he was talking about, but I had never heard the end of it.</p> <p>"Yeah," he admitted. It didn't sound like much, but for whatever reason, I decided that I had to let go of his arm and say it again. "And then there, I saw a lot of it."</p> <p>"Uh-huh," I nodded. "And that's a good sign."</p> <p>"So, can I give you a ride home?" he asked, smiling.</p> <p>"Sure," I said, and he got out of the car without another word.</p> <p>"Um, what would you like to do," I said after he pulled away.</p> <p>"Well, I really had fun, and I think I'd like to go to a movie tonight."</p> <p>"Well, there's a movie theater not too far away. It's pretty cool," I said. I liked the idea of going to some movie.</p> <p>"Cool," he agreed. "I'll catch you afterwards."</p> <p>He got back into the car.</p> <p>"Hey," I said, "can you pull me home?"</p> <p>"Yeah, sure."</p> <p>I got in after him and tried to make my car drive smoothly through, but when I looked back, I could just make out the guy's eyes on me as they met his. I decided I'd rather not go that route. But I couldn't have him getting in the car in the middle of this mess. So I tried not to laugh at him. But I must have had something in my eye because he took his hand from the wheel and let go of mine, and I couldn't tell what he saw in my face.</p> <p>"Don't laugh at me," he said in a slow, but forceful, voice, then reached over me and put his hand back on the wheel with a smile on his face and said, "It's okay, honey."</p> <p>I smiled back. "Thanks. I appreciate it." I hoped I was doing the right thing. "Do you work in the theater?"</p> <p>"Yes," he answered. "I've actually been doing it for a while now. It's one of my favorite parts."</p> <p>I had to admit, I'd read somewhere that guys liked a chick with a big ass sometimes. I smiled. If the theater was any good, it certainly was for me.</p> <p>"Cool," I said, then I decided that was good enough. "What do you have in mind?"</p> <p>"Have you ever had sex in the theater?" he asked.</p> <p>"If you're interested," I said.</p> <p>"Yeah, I have," he agreed, then he looked over to me and shrugged his shoulders. "Why do you want to see me in those movies? If they are so good, I can watch them sometime."</p> <p>I didn't know what to say, so I said, "Let's just watch them together. The first one we watch together would be, you know, right after your girlfriend gets off of her back, and the second movie we watch together will be after she gets off."</p> <p>He glanced down at his watch - and it was just after eleven - and back to me. "You mean you're gonna sit in the back seat afterwards?" he finally asked, then he held up a hand in front of me. "So we can watch the movie togetherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
