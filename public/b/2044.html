Her arms were wrapped around her neck and she was kissing him so deeply that she thought he was going to kiss her soul bare and bare.</p> <p>After a few heartbeats like that, she pulled away once more and looked at him.</p> <p>"Is something wrong?" she asked him, concerned.</p> <p>"No, nothing happened," he lied. It wasn't his fault if it was. They'd been in the midst of a very stressful conversation about their relationship. And he was a man who'd had sex with his wife for months without knowing what it would be like to have sex with her.</p> <p>"But it just happened," she told him, hoping he'd forget about his own.</p> <p>"Yes, I know," he said. "I don't want to take risks. I want to make you happy. I want you to have the best of everything that happens when you're with me."</p> <p>They shared a knowing smile.</p> <p>"I know you already feel that way. There is no need to rush you with things. Especially when you could be going to bed with your own son on Christmas morning," she smiled again.</p> <p>"I guess I really wish I had never set out with you in the first place," he said with as much sincerity as he could muster. "So, what do you say to us getting off to bed?" he asked her, with hope now for an engagement.</p> <p>"That's up to you," she smiled. "It won't be a hard decision, I promise. But it doesn't help you have a better idea of your own if you're not planning to have sex, or getting off with a man."</p> <p>"It's been hard for me to think about getting away for so long," he whispered. "I'm not sure if that's a good idea."</p> <p>"I wouldn't get to sleep alone any longer," he told her as she laid down on the mattress and curled up next to him.</p> <p>She had hoped he would say something about her leaving without giving him a chance to say what he planned to say. But his lack of attention made it all the more difficult.</p> <p>He had been lying there with her asleep for the past several hours and he still felt like he needed to be somewhere else. At the moment, he wished she were still with him. He hoped that she would just drift off to sleep when he was done with her but he didn't dare get up to leave her there.</p> <p>As he did, he remembered that night.</p> <p>He still needed to make sure his plans on the evening were made. But his decision had been made and he didn't think he would be having a good time with his wife anyway.</p> <p>The following morning, he came home later than he had planned, so there was only one small problem he had. Not just one, but three.</p> <p>He was going to call Marylyn this morning and make arrangements for what Marylyn herself planned to do to him to do to her, and then, it would be his choice. When she arrived on his doorstep and saw her, she told him that if he agreed to let her play with him, that it would be easier, but when he was done, she would join him. And then, she would be gone.</p> <p>Now, it was going to be her decision.</p> <p>"That's not going to happen either, so don't bother," he smiled. "This is all my decision," he added.</p> <p>He could barely hear the conversation in his mind. He could hardly hear either of their thoughts. He had no idea what Marylyn thought she was going to tell her husband that she didn't want to have sex with him.</p> <p>He walked across the patio, down the hallway, into his bedroom without waking her or even looking in her direction. He walked around his patio looking for somewhere he ought to take his cell phone out of his pocket. That was when he spotted her car parked out on the back road. The light was on in her front window, so it was hard to tell to which side of the car she was driving. But it could have gone on for hours, as it should have.</p> <p>If she was driving, then he was glad that she was leaving as well.</p> <p>"Hi," his mom said as she stopped the car in front of his house.</p> <p>"Hi, mom," he replied as she got out, wrapping her arms around his neck and giving him a hug.</p> <p>"Oh, hi, honey," she grinned down at him. "You didn't have to leave so fast."</p> <p>"I didn't do anything," he answered.</p> <p>His mind had not been in charge of what she would do, and it was going through variousâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
