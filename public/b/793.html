"We gotta take this stuff into the truck and drive back."</p> <p>"Where?"</p> <p>"We are gonna drive down to the airport now and meet our new friends."</p> <p>"Is everybody in the office?"</p> <p>"All in good time."</p> <p>"So, where's mom and dad?"</p> <p>"She has friends over somewhere, and I have some friends over who I could call."</p> <p>"You have some friends, too."</p> <p>"Yeah, mom and dad are a little older than us, too, you know?"</p> <p>"Cool, too." I couldn't really be surprised if I didn't get laid and was too drunk to think that it mattered, but not with my ex's mom here. It didn't really matter anymore. That was all that counted. If a guy really wanted to kiss my mother, I could deal.</p> <p>"You're kidding me," Sam said, standing up. "She's asleep."</p> <p>"Why are you sitting here?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm not going to sit here until my mom gets back."</p> <p>"What kind of a father sleeps with her? She just can't sleep."</p> <p>"She's just sleeping in my bed with my dick in her hand."</p> <p>"Yeah, I saw that, just thinking about how your dick looked a little different in her hand in the shower."</p> <p>"Well, what do you want to do now?"</p> <p>"Well, I can change clothes and clean up and come back and finish with you."</p> <p>"That'd be good. I mean, I'd want to just sleep in my own bed."</p> <p>"Yeah, that'd be good and I'm sure you still feel guilty."</p> <p>"Oh, stop it, you perv. It was pretty much the only thing we were really doing. Now be serious. I wouldn't sleep with you because of how you felt about me."</p> <p>Sam looked at me and gave me one of those look that said it all.</p> <p>"Oh, really?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"You're cool with it, Sam."</p> <p>"Are you kidding? You're the absolute best girlfriend in the world! I'd do anything for you!"</p> <p>"It's good to hear you say that, baby. I want some serious sex, too."</p> <p>"That's right, I knew it. I would've done it myself once I started to notice that you wanted to be different. You're just super handsome and so hot. Mom's probably never going to get over that, and I don't want to ruin her good mood or anything. So, we'd better make this night great. If it gets any better, it'll be like the first night in forever!"</p> <p>"I don't think so."</p> <p>"Do you really think that we have to start somewhere, and that you can't fuck me again?"</p> <p>"Yeah, you're right," Sam said. "I just meant what I said about not breaking mom."</p> <p>* * * ** ***</p> <p>"Oh, man," I groaned, sitting down on the couch for a second. As much of a guy as I was in college, I hated my mom. I hated her.</p> <p>But, now that I was here, I wanted her to fuck him and if we ended up with that, then I was okay with that.</p> <p>I could have done all these things with my girlfriend, and now that she was here, well, it was just a matter of time. I really wanted her to do this, because it was the thing I had wanted to do for so long. I wanted her to enjoy getting fucked by a real man, and it was my mom who was going to get the fucking of her life.</p> <p>I looked at my watch and saw that it was only a minute before mom's mom was going to be home from work. So I waited and watched the clock on the TV, getting more and more excited every minute.</p> <p>* * * **</p> <p>I took the phone out of my pocket and started to call Sam to warn him.</p> <p>I could feel both of my hands shaking as Sam said goodbye to me. My hands shook harder as I said goodbye to him. The second my hand flew to the phone, I heard the words and felt as though their words were being spoken in an instant.</p> <p>"Oh, shit, I'm sorry, I need to know before I say anything," I said with a worried smile. "You just let me hold up for a couple minutes, just to let me know you're safeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
