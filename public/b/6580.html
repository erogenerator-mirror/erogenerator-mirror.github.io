It's nothing and no one will see your face, it's just for this weekend. It's a bit late to go and try to go out to lunch, so why don't you stay here with me?"</p> <p>I looked back at the woman to see her smiling and nodding at me. "You know where our rooms are?"</p> <p>"Right in the woods behind that big bush?"</p> <p>I nodded and took a good look around. "Yep, that way we can go out there and enjoy the morning."</p> <p>"Perfect!" she said, giving me a look of amusement. "That's a fun idea...and I thought you couldn't get enough?"</p> <p>"Sorry, yes I can." A wicked smile had crept across my lips. "Let's go out in the woods for a bit and see if we can get away with it."</p> <p>The woman smiled again. "Very good Mr. Rimes. Thanks for a great weekend."</p> <p>With that, she picked up her overnight bag and headed for the door with me.</p> <p>I turned back, my heart pounding with excitement.</p> <p>"What's that thing? Why did you get a big house like that for me anyway?" "You didn't really know any other way to spend it? You just thought about yourself, it was nothing that I wanted."</p> <p>Hmmm. "Yeah...that's not exactly what I would have done. I don't get to go where I live when I'm alone. Or I can try the new 'home' I could come to. I have to stop running around and come wherever I can, and then..."</p> <p>"Come here." She pulled me gently after her. I stepped back against the door. She pulled me toward her and our heads touched. Those lips again touched, this time they were almost a tender kiss, more so than the first time. Her mouth began to caress my mouth with a soft gentle caress. Our kiss lengthened. My cock grew hard between us. I could now feel the heat from her body as our lips touched.</p> <p>As I leaned back with her to kiss her, I felt her hand on my thigh, slowly coming closer and closer to my cock. The kiss continued. She pushed me back further. "This way," she said, her hand slipping down to cup and stroke my balls.</p> <p>I was now pressed tightly against her body. My hands were under her jacket, and I began to caress her breasts. She moaned and began to hum and groan in rhythm with my kisses.</p> <p>"You feel so good," she moaned as her hand squeezed both my testicles in a massaging fashion and her touch. "And this," she went on, beginning to draw her other hand over to my other testicle and caressing it lightly. I let her do that while her lips kissed me and then started to kiss the underside of my breasts. I felt my cock pulsing and straining with need. It was now fully erect and pushing up against my slacks.</p> <p>"Oh god!" I moaned softly. This was not a good idea. I would definitely lose my license! That was a really hot situation for me to be in. My hands started unbinding her blouse. She broke the kiss and moved away from me. She quickly slid her blouse off and laid it on the bed. As the cloth touched my face, I sucked in a deep breath of air and felt my cock leap as the cool touch of her skin sent a chill down my body.</p> <p>She leaned in closer and kissed me again. Our tongues met as my hands found her thighs to caress as her hands began unfastening my pants.</p> <p>We broke our kiss and looked each other in the eyes again for a second. She started to unfasten my belt then, as if in a dream, she pulled it off. She slid my pants and underwear down. My cock sprang out with it. It was hard and throbbing.</p> <p>For once, I was not the only spectator in this moment. My partner continued to kiss and stroke my cock as her hand cupped my balls in their sac. This time, she pulled the sac down as far as she could with one hand and used the other hand to caress the head of my cock. She wrapped the thumb and pointer finger of her right hand around the base of my hard cock and began to stroke me. My excitement was increasing with each stroke.</p> <p>"Do you want to take some pictures with me?" she asked, her mouth just inches from my cock.</p> <p>"Sure," I whispered. I took several more pictures of her in her bra and skirt. "I'm all set for lunch, I'll take some of this."</p> <p>"Excellent," she said as she leaned close again.
