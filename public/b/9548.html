But I still need to ask why we are having sex at the same time."</p> <p>Looking up at me, there was something glimmer in her eyes. She smiled and nodded. We walked toward the door.</p> <p>As we reached for the door and I pulled my hand away with a smile. She said, "So you're going to fuck me, what do you want to do?" Then she quickly stepped inside ajar of the door and locked it. We left the next evening after exchanging phone numbers and email addresses. I had a busy week planned. Friday</p> <p>So, I emailed her our plans for our week together. I would be spending the following Monday working in the office doing some work for her as a consultant. The days I spent with her were filled with the sex, of which he was just the star. He and I had a great relationship and always had a great time on the weekends. The days I spent with her with him were full of sex.</p> <p>She sent me a message of wanting to talk with me on Monday morning and I accepted her calls and email. She also wrote her note asking me to be at her apartment on Saturday at noon. I agreed to her request. We planned for everything that came up.</p> <p>Saturday</p> <p>As I parked my car in front of her condo complex, I noticed that her car was still there. She opened the door as I walked to the elevator. As I got off the elevator, I took her in my arms and kissed her. We kissed. She broke the kiss and looked into my eyes. With an impish grin, she grabbed my crotch, then pushed me toward the door. As we were crossing the threshold, before we could enter, I leaned her back against the wall. Then, dropping my shorts and shoes, she pushed me against the wall and wrapped her legs around my waist. As I stepped out of the doorway, she ran her hands up and down my back.</p> <p>Before we could enter the apartment or start to close the door, she was kissing me passionately and slowly pushing her tongue into my mouth. As I kissed her back, she cupped and pulled my chest up as her hands ran all over my muscular body. She broke our kiss to look me in the eyes again.</p> <p>"I know. I was hoping you were really going to fuck me on Friday."</p> <p>"Oh, I was planning to take the day off, but then you should know, I still have much to tell you," I said as we kissed again. We walked to the front door and once again reached for the key card. She unlocked the door and led me inside. I looked around the apartment. It was small. There was a desk on one wall of the apartment near the living room. There were no television, TV, computers, etc.; so the TV was in a corner on the other wall. The front bedroom of her apartment was just off the living room.</p> <p>It was a single large room with three small bedrooms, a large kitchen on one side, a small kitchen off the other, a walk-in closet against the far corner. As I looked around, she pulled me closer whispering, "Oh yes. I have wanted this all week. Every part of me wants it!"</p> <p>Once I was close enough to kiss her again, I slid her over and dropped my face to her breasts. I began to unbutton her blouse. I kissed each one and licked each nipple. Once each one was done, I slid her skirt and panties down and pulled them to the top of her feet.</p> <p>Once I was done undressing her, I told her I needed to take a shower first. As she walked into the bathroom, she gave me a sexy look and then turned the shower on. I watched as the water heated up. The steam filled the room. As the heat built on, the water felt amazing and as I watched, she ran her hands over her body and spread her legs wider apart.</p> <p>I stepped into the shower and reached up and rinsing the wash cloth, I slowly pulled her panties down her legs. She stepped out of the shower and dried her tits. While drying her legs, she again wrapped her arms around me and kissed me. Then took the wash cloth and began to wipe her legs, pussy and back. When her legs were as clean as they could be, she stood in front of me and kissed me again. She pushed me back against the shower wall. "Don't move and let me dry you," she said as she reached between us and grabbed my cock. She rubbed her fingers around the head in her juices. "Do not think your cock feels anyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
