They could tell by the tone in their groins that they were rapidly approaching an explosive, simultaneous climax: Carla's pussy tightening around Marks as he drove into her with a fierce ferocity.</p> <p>The noise of Carla's grunts grew louder and more urgent and more urgent until Carla came, squirting hotly out of the lips of her pussy and onto Marks' thrusting cock.</p> <p>They collapsed together, their bodies still locked tight together, their breath coming in hard, ragged gasps. Carla kissed Marks on the tip and ran her tongue down to her own mouth, tasting the salt of Mark's cum. The kisses turned passionate and insistent, each one drawing another orgasm from them, the sounds of their flesh slapping together mingled and became louder and more feverish.</p> <p>Finally they rolled apart, leaving Mark lying between Carla's wide open thighs and Carla licking her fingers clean.</p> <p>Mark lifted her legs up in the air and drove into her, feeling every ridge of his rigid shaft, the tight elasticity of her cunt and the wet sounds of their lovemaking. Carla wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him deeply, then eased him out so they could kiss each other.</p> <p>"Are you ready to move?" Carla breathed hotly at Mark.</p> <p>"Let's go."</p> <p>They moved up and then to their bed. Once on to the covers Carla took their dicks in her hands gently, stroking them as they hardened and lengthened and twitching as they hardened.</p> <p>They moved again so Carla knelt up on the bed between Marks legs and ran hot and slippery fingers up and down his cock, making him moan, feeling the slick heat of his swollen cock as she stroked him and sucked him.</p> <p>His eyes followed her finger-filled lips and stared into her eyes as she took him into her. Mark reached out in return with his hands, helping Carla with her hands around his shaft and balls and their mouths met and kissed again, their tongues darting in and out as their mouths moved together in a wet, swirling dance.</p> <p>Marks' cock was fully hard again as the pair of them caressed and toyed with each others' arousal and anticipation. He slipped back his finger from Carla's mouth and slid it back and forth slowly, watching as her tongue continued to roll and dance with its own pleasure.</p> <p>They lay back and kissed gently, each savouring the other for the first time since they entered this wonderful part of their bodies, each breathing in and out as their lust built, building slowly to a height neither could ever imagine. As they kissed, exploring each others mouth with their tongues, he caressed her breasts, running his hands over her stomach, her hips, her thighs, her belly. She moaned and giggled, and then gasped his name, and she kissed him with greater urgency as she sucked his tongue and kissed him again.</p> <p>Marks was now caressing her legs, feeling their heat and softness. As he stroked her legs, he moved his hands from her ankles to her hips, and back along her thighs. His fingers slid under the material of her panty-girdle, and gently lifted the soft cotton aside so he could explore the soft, moist heat of her cunt as she continued to kiss him.</p> <p>Carla moved herself up and leaned closer to Marks face, wrapping her left arm and leg round him as she lay on her back. She kissed him again, tasting his lips, feeling and tasting her own juices as he suckled her tongue. He took her nipples between his fingers in appreciation of the softness and heat of her own nipples, and then slowly he began to rub them with his thumbs.</p> <p>As Carla writhed and groaned into Marks mouth, he slid one hand between her legs and felt her swollen and wet cunt for the first time. He slid one fingers into her hot, wet hole as his thumb continued to circle and squeeze her clitoris and clitoris hood. She gasped and writhed as his fingers teased the lips of her cunt and teased her clitoris.</p> <p>"Ah God," Carla groaned as she felt his fingers inside her vagina. His thumb worked gently on her clitoris as he began to move his finger in a circular motion in a slow figure eight over her clitoris, feeling it hard and throbbing underneath his fingers.</p> <p>"You're so nice," Carla groaned as she felt his finger work its way from her clitoris back to her pussy, and then slowly across her taut clitoris, teasing her in a slow, lazy motion. "Harder," she gasped. "Fuck me."</p> <p>Mark's fingers moved deeper and faster inside Carla's hot, wet tunnel. Her thighs shuddered as his fingers moved gentlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
