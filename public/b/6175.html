I was trying desperately to hold back a scream but it just wasn't possible. When I heard it, I wanted it. There was no stopping now. The pain, the pain was overwhelming. Tears began to trickle out of my eyes.</p> <p>I could feel her soft fingers and the softness, the smoothness, the cool touch, and the wetness of her. I couldn't believe how much I wanted her.</p> <p>"Don't come," she whispered. "I want you. I want you." Those words almost seemed to echo through me. "I want you."</p> <p>It wasn't just her touch, "I want you" talking. This wasn't just this moment or this moment, this was all too real. Her hands moved all over me and she squeezed and caressed and pressed and explored and kissed all at the same time. I couldn't believe how I felt. I was overwhelmed. I was trembling. And when she moved between my legs again, this time she was kissing me. And when she kissed me there, she touched me and it was like she was touching my heart, and she was trying to reach it with her tongue.</p> <p>"I feel like you want them," she whispered. "Like you want them."</p> <p>I didn't know if it was my imagination, but it was real and it made me feel the same. She was right. My body craved her kisses. She knew and felt it. She must have sensed, because the desire that was so evident in my eyes was gone. I was still trembling.</p> <p>"Don't come." I couldn't stop myself. "Don't come." I couldn't stop my eyes from going blank, but there wasn't enough room in the small booth, so I closed them. Even I wasn't able to make the sound that I needed to.</p> <p>I felt the tip of her tongue on my clitoris. It was so sensitive. I was so aroused. I wanted her to want me to want her. I wanted to feel her touch on me but I couldn't.</p> <p>"Please." It wasn't just that I said it, though. I said it. There were tears in my eyes, I wanted it, but I was afraid she could feel the emotions I was feeling.</p> <p>"If you want me, you need to come." I thought I'd said it, but there was no need, just a whisper. I didn't want her to know who I was. That would ruin the moment.</p> <p>Instead, she began to kiss and lick, and rub and massage. Her touch made my body feel as good as sex felt. It made me feel as if it had been built for this.</p> <p>When she began to take one of my hands into hers, I opened my eyes. I didn't want her to leave. I didn't want her to stay where she was.</p> <p>"Don't you want to be with me?" she asked when she had kissed and licked all round my sex.</p> <p>I couldn't answer because I feared what she would say. I couldn't bring myself to say anything.</p> <p>"I never wanted to be with you, not even when I masturbated. I couldn't understand that."</p> <p>She was right, of course.</p> <p>"I never wanted to be with all of you; all you have," was all I could say.</p> <p>She laughed. "You mean you didn't mean it?"</p> <p>"No," I said. I was too scared to speak.</p> <p>"When I masturbated, I thought I was doing it wrong," she said. "But you and I were having sex, and I had no control. How it felt when you put yourself inside me. We were fucking. That's all."</p> <p>"Don't be silly," I said. "Just think about it. It's okay. It wasn't wrong. It was perfect."</p> <p>I just couldn't lie. She might have been right.</p> <p>"It was perfect," she said. "But now, you have to understand. That's right. I'm the reason you did this to us."</p> <p>There was no doubt in my mind that she had me right; that I knew all of her and all that I had was desire. She might have made a deal with herself. She probably didn't want me to be alone with her. I wasn't sure that she would be able to do that. I had felt that way before, but never with someone like she was. I didn't know about what else to do. The world felt that way now.</p> <p>She moved her kisses and licks to my breasts. Those soft licks and she had such a way of arousing me.</p> <p>"Don't you want them now? I won't have you wanting me in the future?" I didn't knowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
