I say as I slowly unbutton my top button revealing my breasts.</p> <p>We sit in silence for a while as my nipples become more erect underneath my clothes.</p> <p>"Why do you always have so much to tell me, you're a horny little slut? It's hard to concentrate today", I say as I take off my top completely as I sit down next to you and reach around you to undo your shorts and pull them down and finally you start to get up off the couch.</p> <p>"No, please no, not yet," you say and we sit in silence for a while.</p> <p>"Don't you worry, I will make sure you feel like you could ever really be in love", you say as you pull off your shirt.</p> <p>Your breasts are small, but just seem so natural, you feel like an artist as your body moves up and down my neck and chest, all the time you touch me, feeling all of my body, not just my face, breasts, flat of stomach... you run your hands over every inch of skin I have to offer. But as the night is still and all that is left of day I want you so much I want to fuck you. You look up at me and see that my face is buried in your breasts, and a moment later you are kissing me, passionately and passionately it's as if we are living again and we make love right here, now. The passion and the passion is incredible. Our mouths locked together and I can taste myself on your lips. You pull me away from you and I sit up and pull you to me wrapping my arms and my legs around your waist and pull you close and kiss you again with such a hunger as before and it brings your arousal back.</p> <p>"I want to make love to you!", I say as I kiss around your neck.</p> <p>"I know", you say.</p> <p>We lie down on the bed and start to kiss again - you start to slide my shorts down and I lift my legs high in the air so you can pull them gently down, to you it goes. It is the sexiest moment of your life and, for me that is. I kiss you down your neck and you have goose flesh which is so perfect. I put another hand on your thigh and move slowly up to your pussy and you can feel just how incredibly wet I am and now I want to see how you do with me. With you lying on the bed I slide my fingers inside you and I can feel your body contract against them. You are so wet and you slide my fingers in a little, the sounds of your wet pussy and the slight noises of your gasps echo around the room. My cock is hard in my pants now, and you move over it so it can slide between your lips. I slide my fingers out and with them go down again to your clit gently playing it again as I slide them in and out a little more and you start to moan in your rhythm.</p> <p>"Tell me how much you like this, you've been waiting so long," I say as I kiss your neck once more and slowly slide my cock into you, making a small groan from underneath.</p> <p>Your eyes close at my first slow thrust of my cock as you come down a little, my hips start to slide in and out as I watch you, I can't look away and you know what I want and just as I start to slide my cock out of your wet pussy you feel so incredibly tight, you can feel my weight on you and you don't seem to mind at all as I slide in and out. You lift your legs up with my hands and pull them so I can really fuck you, I can feel your wetness on me and hear you moan as I fuck you. I can feel the blood rushing through my cock and you are starting to shake and feel so tight on mine. I want to cum, but we don't, we want to make love.</p> <p>"We're not done yet baby." With that I slide in and out a little faster and I can see you biting your lip again as I feel you tighten up around my cock for a moment and then you relax in front of me.</p> <p>"What? What did you say?" I asked, hoping at all of the pleasure you can derive from the feelings I now have from inside of you.</p> <p>"I said "fuck me".</p> <p>I kiss you once more.</p> <p>I hold your legs high in the air and slide inside of her, I can see your breath, feel your pussy contracting and pulsing around my cock and I can feel your orgasm coming. I pull out slowly and start to push in as you feel my cock coming out of you and you feel like it's going to be a waterfall of electricity.</p> <p>I can feel you starting to squirt and I leanâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
