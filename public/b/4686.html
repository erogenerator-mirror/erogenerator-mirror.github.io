Are you kidding? I was actually going to say, 'Wow, I would've had the nerve to come over here and introduce myself'. No, I wasn't kidding! I'm such an ass!" he laughed. "I think I know what you were thinking! "</p> <p>"I'm sure you are an ass, because I'm not kidding. I'm kidding!"</p> <p>I turned and looked at him and saw the look of lust flicker in his eyes and I almost said 'Are you kidding me? No way' – but stopped myself and said it a bit too loudly.</p> <p>"Well, you can be an ass in a pinch, but just a nice one." I said. "It's just that, well, I'm a bit apprehensive. The things I've heard about you are a bit...intense at times," I said.</p> <p>His eyes widened and he turned red. "Ah! I was just joking!"</p> <p>But it was my turn to smile. "Well to answer her first, I guess it's ok with you if I go on with the story, since I'm sure her name's not that important", I answered.</p> <p>He looked at me again and nodded. "You're a woman. We all will be able to do something like that."</p> <p>"I suppose you're right. Well, I just want to assure you that her name is not that important." I said. "I think she's quite lovely."</p> <p>"Mmm! Oh yeah!" he replied. "I'll keep working on her!" he said as he got up from the couch and went to his bedroom with a smile.</p> <p>I looked at him a second, thinking about the way you would have described him when that was done, but still didn't say anything. After a couple of minutes, he came in and sat down on the sofa beside me. "Have you ever gone to bed with a woman before?" he asked.</p> <p>"No." I replied honestly. "But I've got the chance."</p> <p>He shrugged, a bit surprised, but then looked over at the clock. "Well, we still have a few hours until we get back. What's your number?" he asked.</p> <p>"Oh, um, I guess twenty-six?" was all I could say. I didn't want him to think that I wasn't a virgin. But he knew me well enough by then to know about everything I'd said and do.</p> <p>"I'll get you your key if you do what I say." he answered, turning back toward me. "But I don't want to go all the way with it because you're just too easy to be too careful. Besides, I'm not going to be doing anything too crazy."</p> <p>"Don't take it personally if you want to, but I don't have any one girl friends in my life." I replied, looking serious.</p> <p>"Don't worry. It's fine with me. Let's just get that done." he grinned. He didn't look exactly happy about it, but he didn't say it out loud. I suppose if I hadn't mentioned it, I probably would've been. Anyway, my last girlfriend had the nerve to mention the details about me to my first lover, so we'd never be able to do anything.</p> <p>"Oh? What about you?" I asked. "Have you ever gotten laid?"</p> <p>"No, I didn't have the courage to broach that subject. I've never really thought about it, but I'm sure there'd be some kind of chance. Besides, if it comes down to it I have to take it all my time and do everything right."</p> <p>"Well I guess at least you've got a lot of experience in that department, huh?" I said, smiling at him. He just smiled back and we exchanged that knowing look again.</p> <p>"Well, you're not the first to me. I mean, I've been with a lot of women before, but nothing like you. You look pretty wild."</p> <p>I nodded. "Yeah, you really do," I said.</p> <p>His expression suddenly changed to a thoughtful one. "I guess a lot of guys go for some pretty wild stuff, but I just never got the chance to try it," he said. "As it happens, I've never tried it."</p> <p>"Well, we're both going to enjoy it," I said. "I can't imagine not being able to tell you."</p> <p>"Nah, it wasn't really a bad deal. I get off on it, just like you. You can tell me too."</p> <p>"I'm not sure I'd want to do it if you don't like it that much."</p> <p>He raised his eyebrows, but said nothing.
