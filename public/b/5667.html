She squeezed it a few times, then released it and sat up so she could see my face.</p> <p>"Do you want me to go down on you?" she inquired.</p> <p>"No not really, but I'm not getting hard, so you better do a good job."</p> <p>I laughed and lay down on the bed so that I could watch her as she got on the bed also and got ready for me. I wanted her to know that I loved her and wanted her for the rest of our lives. I could not ask her to do this to me. She was very sweet, and I wanted to take time to love her. I lay down and watched her. I ran my fingers along her hair and her neck, making her gasp a little at first, then moan a little as she lowered her face and placed her lips on my dick and began to kiss it.</p> <p>"Would you like me to be your first?" she whispered.</p> <p>"Yes," I gasped.</p> <p>"Good, because I want to you to be my first."</p> <p>She raised up off my dick and got on her knees, her head between my legs and her breasts to my chest. She kissed her way down my stomach, finally coming to me and taking a nipple into her mouth, I looked up at her and she smiled and winked. I lay back with my hands behind my head and her mouth continued to work its way down my abdomen. I felt her lips touch the hair covering my pubic hair, then my shaft as she took just the tip into her mouth. The hair was quite long, and then I felt the warm wet flesh on my dick as she started stroking me up and down. Her other hand was rubbing my balls and I felt my cock beginning to grow.</p> <p>She was doing it just right, I thought to myself. She had done this to me before, and loved it. Then I felt her lips enveloping my dick as she began her slow but very very sexy blowjob. I couldn't even talk. I just closed my eyes and enjoyed the sensation and wanted her to feel as good as she used to, to make love to me. She didn't even seem to care that she was giving me head. Her tongue danced in my shaft and she took me deep inside her mouth. Her hand was stroking me up and down, occasionally stopping to rub the head with her hand, which felt incredibly good as it rubbed through my hair. I felt myself growing as she put on quite a show, then pulled her mouth off my penis as I was on fire with desire.</p> <p>"Put your arms by my sides so I can touch you," she told me.</p> <p>I did as I was told. I moved to lay down with my face near hers. I heard her gasp as she looked down and saw that my erection was just inches from her. She reached up and took my dick in her hands. It looked good, she mused as she stroked it back and forth and rubbed it against her breasts over her bra which she still wasn't wearing. I was looking at her hands as she stroked my dick. Then she put her hands on top of mine and led me up to her. She lay back on the bed with her legs spread apart. Her head rolled over as she reached for my cock and directed it to her sopping wet hole. She slid down onto my shaft without waiting for instructions. I felt like I was in hell as she slowly lowered herself down until my knob was lodged inside me. I heard myself moan as I took a second to focus on her in front of me, my eyes never leaving hers, hers on mine, her eyes watching me as she rode me.</p> <p>"Now, how is that? Oh yes, I love how you take me," I groaned as she rode me.</p> <p>"You are a good lover John. You take the edge off," she said as she looked down the length of my body.</p> <p>"I did tell you I loved it," I said.</p> <p>"That you did," she cooed. "I love your cock." I felt her body shudder a little and looked up into her eyes.</p> <p>"I want to do this differently. It's like going for a run as it's a long run," she told me. "When I'm really in the zone, all I'm thinking about is pleasing you."</p> <p>Then she looked back down at me again.</p> <p>"Is this the moment of truth for you John? Have you been with someone else?"</p> <p>I couldn't speak.
