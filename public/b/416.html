When I was able to look up and open my eyes again I saw him again. He was standing in front of me but he didn't seem to be looking at me. The sight of him made me nervous but I just stood there, with my arm around my waist.</p> <p>Now that he was directly in front of me, my heart was pounding in my chest and it was too late. He made sure that my hand got a real close up of me from behind. Then he started rubbing my breasts. The sensation on my skin made my nipples harden but he didn't pull my nipples, he just sort of let my breasts swing to and fro and they felt nice in my hands.</p> <p>This took me over the edge of another orgasm, not that I'm complaining. After he stopped he went back to rubbing me gently, occasionally pressing his hand up against the top of my panties. He slowly caressed me on my front, down to my hips and then back up again. This time he did my bottom. At first I thought it was so that he could do my back but when he cupped my bottom and cupped a cheek, something else happened. I was getting really wet down there.</p> <p>He gently ran a finger down the cleft of my ass and pushed it into my pussy as far as it could go. He then turned me around and moved me to a position where I could bend over so he could get a clear view down my cleft in front of him. I leaned over his desk without lifting up. As he stood there looking my ass in his face, I took the hint and slowly lifted my skirt so that his eyes could clearly see how wet I was getting.</p> <p>"How's it going out there in that car?" I asked. His eyes just looked at me and didn't ask anything. It was a big question but in my mind, the answer was obvious right away.</p> <p>"Oh, it's great," he said, "it's perfect."</p> <p>He reached to his pocket and took out his cash. Then he held out his hand for mine," I'll take this. It's not going to cost you, but it's a start."</p> <p>I took his hand and he pulled me over to the side of the class again. Once there he sat me down again. He stood up with me. That was where all this started. We were going to stop it and then just fuck like crazy in his office, not in his personal office where all of the girls were present. I didn't really believe that he wanted me to stop it but it seemed pretty obvious. I was going to be a really bad girl though. He sat me down again and had me stand in front of him again. When he was sitting down, my legs couldn't get up very high and as I sat down he used the leverage on the seat to lift. His leg was rubbing against my crotch even more insistently than before.</p> <p>I was so wet that there was absolutely no resistance this time. All in all, we were sitting in a classroom, naked apart from our shoes and socks. He kept caressing me down there, even though my ass was covered in my own juices.</p> <p>Just as I thought, if we stopped it I'd be the one fucking him. The thought was in my head. At first I resisted but as I went along my excitement started to build, too. I just wanted to make him cum hard. I could feel it in his breathing. Soon he didn't say or do anything, just sat there. He was getting really excited and I could tell that he wanted to cum.</p> <p>But I didn't want to interfere. As exciting as all this was, my next thought was what he'd think before I did it. I was the one who was going to be fucking him. I was the one who wanted to be his first. As far as he was concerned I was the one who had to be the one to be his first.</p> <p>I could see his eyes start to focus a bit more intently. He was looking at me as if I was going to say something and I wasn't going to. I was feeling the excitement rising in me too, too. I knew it would only be a short while, maybe an hour or so, but I was sure that we couldn't stop him. And then we were both going to be fucking each other.</p> <p>He sat there with his eyes locked onto my cunt, his lips parted in a small smile. It was very close and I was on the edge. But I still wanted him to say something. I just thought he'd see that I was excited, too.</p> <p>Then he asked if he could see more. I told him, sure, what man wouldn't? He looked up and got me a good look at me, I mean the whole time. His eyes kept going up and down my body andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
