Suddenly, she was lying on top of me, her body close to mine. My eyes rolled back into my head. I could hardly believe it.</p> <p>"Let me tell you something," said Tina. She kissed me deeply, as if she were the one who should be the one to kiss me for it was really for me. "You have to be the one to kiss me, and it's my job to do so." She looked at me and said, "That's right...you should do that."</p> <p>To make her point, she bent her head and kissed me all the way up my neck to my ear, with wet, wet kiss. She kissed and sucked my earlobe and then moved her hand down my body and began exploring my thighs. My body was still shaking, and I wanted to run away, but my mind was focused on Tina's fingers. My mouth was agape when she began kissing and sucking my nipples again. She started with one nipple then moved down my stomach to my belly button. She kissed around my belly-button and down to my navel. Her head was in my belly-button and I could feel a warm wet tongue licking it. By now, she was naked. I couldn't really see her, but I knew she was fully shaved in the front, and when her fingers touched my pussy lips I almost came and so did she. I could feel my clitoris was on fire and if it was not already on the edge of being aroused, then I would have had another orgasm.</p> <p>"I love going down on you," she said, "Just for you."</p> <p>"But...but...but don't...oh!"</p> <p>My mind was in a daze, and I was totally lost in her touch. I felt her mouth come down to meet my pussy. This first contact made my body twitch and I moaned. Her tongue teased my wet clitoris, and when it finally penetrated my vulva, my body involuntarily arched. I was suddenly aware of her fingers rubbing my clitoris and then sliding slowly and teasingly around my clitoris. My hands were caressing her back down to her ass cheeks, and then they left my shoulders to slide down her back. My hands trailed to her ass again and started massaging her cheek as her tongue licked my clitoris faster until I was going wild. I could hear my breathing getting heavier, and could feel a wave of warmth on my belly-button and her nose in the small of my belly.</p> <p>"I thought that you wouldn't come! And now you can't!"</p> <p>I felt her fingers moving around my pussy lips and then gently parting them. My body felt tingly all over and my pussy tingled and felt tingly, and that seemed to trigger my inner self. I arched my back and pushed my hips towards her. She started licking my clitoris and then slid one finger up and into my pussy. We both let out a long moan, and then I felt a hand on the outside of my thighs, spreading me wide, and then another finger was moving in and out of my pussy in rhythm with her mouth. She took her mouth out, and started kissing up and down my belly, then her tongue found my clit again. She started sucking it gently, and slowly moved her mouth around it. She kissed the lips, bit it, and then began kissing my thighs up to my pelvis. I started moving my body up and down, and started kissing up to her and then started kissing her neck. I could feel her hands moving up and down my back, and then I could feel two sets of soft, soft hands touching my back, shoulders and hairline to get closer to me. I stopped kissing her neck and began kissing her neck and ears. I moved down to her shoulders and started kissing her earlobes.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful," said Tina, "and so warm."</p> <p>She continued kissing and moving further down to my tummy, but she seemed ready to continue kissing me wherever her hand went. Her soft, wet kisses were now moving down my chest and tummy, as her tongue explored my belly-button, and then she got to it. She gently kissed my belly-button, with the tip of her tongue running out from each lip, to move down to my mons and then stop to continue to kiss it and move on to my legs. Her hands were moving all over me all over, feeling my thighs, belly-button and vulva, and her lips and tongue moved further down to lick my soft, curly pubic hair.</p> <p>"I like you going down on me," gasped Tina, "I want to show you something." With this she moved her mouth down towards the middle of her tummyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
