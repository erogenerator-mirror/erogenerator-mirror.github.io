My dad had a large sum of money which was in the form of an order he would send me so that I could have a room in that tiny building for the summer. His real estate and real estate agent was the same. He even offered me the job in the meantime as an accountant and started work at the company in my hometown. He was good enough at it to pay me enough for three months of regular work for the summer.</p> <p>We were able to get the three of us out of the house, where it was just a couple of blocks from our destination to the big city and there we took an unpacked car and some furniture to share.</p> <p>Then I told her that the first thing we should do before we went for our trip was visit a local shopping mall.</p> <p>'Then we will return to the apartment and we would start out there by visiting some nice malls till we reach home. By then we would come back here to the apartment.</p> <p>The shops I visited had a good selection of clothes, lingerie, and many different items that we could enjoy for a whole day. My parents loved shopping for me but not for them.</p> <p>'When we went to buy a couple of items at one store, we went in alone. I had bought some panties as I got up to go to the bathroom, and a bra, but that was the last one. I wanted to be the only one with no underwear.</p> <p>'We then sat down one of the shopping carts and started browsing. There were a lot of items, from clothing designer to model to clothing stores to clothes department to a variety of things. 'We got an idea before we did so we picked what we wanted and put the items in the cart. I was hoping that I could have selected just one thing, not the panties, or lingerie.</p> <p>'The first item was a plain t-shirt with a plain pair of jeans and a pair of sandals. That would show a bit of thigh but that was it. But then we would pick something else in the order we saw it in.</p> <p>'We started to go out in our shopping, which were only three to five blocks away. We would take the escalator down to the main streets, which were only a couple of blocks away from the mall, and we would go down to the main building where we would park, where we could walk straight ahead.</p> <p>'We picked four pairs of clothes, which we had in order to enjoy, which we did in order to take a chance and buy more.</p> <p>'One of the first things we did in order to feel some control of each other. And that was done in the last two years.</p> <p>'Then we got a second shopping cart, which was one of several that one set that two could go.</p> <p>'It was also a good opportunity to choose what we wanted to wear in public so we did not go to other stores to see which pairs to go in.</p> <p>'What we chose was to wear a pair of pantihose and bra. We chose a pair that each was completely transparent, with little underthings and a few very sexy, if not risqué, lingerie.</p> <p>'When we got to the shopping area of mall, we left the shopping items there. The clothing was different from where we went to buy more than we were. Most of it was for people to go visit, while sometimes there was other people to wander around.</p> <p>'We also chose to leave the shopping cart where it was, on the main thorough through the mall to a nearby shop that was for display for visitors.</p> <p>'We then went to a few other stores, and when we got back, we left the shopping cart on the car, which was parked in the mall's parking lot, like we had done in other malls, when we came in.</p> <p>'That's what we wanted to go and say that I am going to visit him on Saturday so his friends can meet him in the hotel restaurant restaurant.' She said, in a sweet voice that made me feel good.</p> <p>'We went back in the shopping mall, and started buying, and when we bought the bags of clothes for the hotel, we picked them up in the shopping carts that had just hit the street.</p> <p>'Now as we were walking to get the bags which were almost empty and when we got back, we walked past a few people walking by. That's when we did what we had set out to do and I went to a store for the last bag of clothes and picked out a selection, for me to go to it.</p> <p>'This was what we bought—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
