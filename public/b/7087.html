She gave me a big wide smile.</p> <p>"And how is this going to go down?" As she spoke, I sat up so I could look through my hair so I could brush it down. "So I guess, I'm not going to have to go with you," She gave me a big smile, but her eyes changed to that wicked look of curiosity.</p> <p>It wasn't really an invitation. Just a chance of getting to know what it would be like for me to be with another woman and not be in her bedroom with some hottie, and she was the kind of girl I felt I could trust. Still, there was one thing that I knew I'd never get to know her like that. "Let's see what happens."</p> <p>"Yeah, and I'm a big girl. We've never been in this position before." She sat up in my lap as I got an extra hand under her ass so I could rest my knee on top of her lower leg. She reached down and started to run a hand over my shoulder as I started to push into her. I loved the feel of her bare skin against my cock, my cock throbbing against the bottom of my thigh. As my hands made circles on top of her ass I found I hadn't even come yet. After all we've gone so far, I knew I'd have to keep trying. It wasn't like we had to have sex, even if it was in my room, so I just concentrated on what was going on and what she felt like.</p> <p>"Hmmm. You like this, huh?" I pushed my hands under her and started to run them over her whole body from her shoulders to her head. The contrast between my hands there on her body was even more intoxicating.</p> <p>"Yes," she whispered.</p> <p>I pushed my hands down to her sides and started to slide them back up. My fingers brushed her sides as I did, pushing a little bit lower until I was just brushing a nipple. It was hard to tell really from where my hands were but when she said the word "touching", it was the place where I was feeling her flesh.</p> <p>As I had her hair I let her hair go, a sort of 'blower' on her as opposed to the normal braided down. She let a couple of drops of water drop, but I hadn't noticed, so I had to keep my hands moving. By now my dick was starting to grow into a tent like it usually gets. I reached back down and gently massaged her back and her butt. As she had done to me before, her hands moved back to just under her breasts.</p> <p>"You're making it a little...well....familiar."</p> <p>"Hmmm. I like the way you think." Again, with that wicked smile, she let her hand slide up the length of my legs. This time it went up my pants leg, my cock starting to rise, but she didn't move it. As she reached the bottom of my zipper, she found the top that was there. A couple of fast little zips were undone right away and she slid her hand inside.</p> <p>"You know, I like that about you. You have such an amazing body. I'm definitely going to make you mine just as soon as I start." The she pulled my cock out of my pants. Without a word, she pulled up my socks, pulling my button through the little hole and then letting go of them to take an even bigger hold of my cock. She bent her head down to just below the head and took a long lick about half way around it before she let go and it popped back up almost instantly.</p> <p>I was already rock hard, but this was new and my hands ran up her back to her little breasts. Now her own hands were moving under my shirt. They kept moving around my nipples for a while but I got a little distracted, getting my hand back under her shirt and rubbing her tits over the cotton fabric. I had a real good idea what had her so worked up and had her back arched into my hands as I squeezed, but she didn't seem to mind.</p> <p>"Can we move this thing around a bit?" I asked her, as she let go of me and sat back up. Her hands slipped in under my shirt and started to massage my chest, pulling the fabric around to show off to her and also to rub up and down the shaft of my cock.</p> <p>"Well? That feels great." She slid her hands down on my dick, giving me a few quick shivers, but I figured it was the other way around, since I was about to come before she got to it.
