"You're so pretty. So smart and all," she added, sliding both hands up his shirt, which had fallen open and exposed just the head of his penis. "I could kiss you all day, but I'm having fun. I like what you have," she said, pulling him along. "I like it when you hold me with your body. I love it. Your chest is amazing. I love it when you caress me..." she added, leaning in and pressing her whole body against him.</p> <p>"I have no idea where those words came from," Eric said with a shrug as he leaned in to kiss her again. "They mean nothing compared to what I just told you."</p> <p>Melody gave him a teasing look and grinned, leaning in for another kiss. "That is more than I expected," she answered as she slipped her other arm around his neck to pull him in.</p> <p>After having already exchanged spit in the most passionate kiss they'd shared so long, the two began to kiss passionately, hands roaming all over one another's body. They kissed for a long time, Eric's hands never leaving her face, as they had for months. Both were in their own world when the doorbell rang.</p> <p>"You can get that," Eric said with a chuckle as he reluctantly pulled away from the kiss. They both stood up and he handed her a robe on the back of a cart which she handed him. They headed downstairs to answer the door.</p> <p>"It's a surprise," he said with a grin.</p> <p>"Is this your first time?" Melody said, stepping through the door wearing nothing but skimpy, high heeled shoes.</p> <p>"We can go for a beer or two," Eric said as he closed the door and slid the door again. She smiled and quickly stepped from the doorway, stepping over the threshold and opening the door for him. He took a good look as she walked, admiring her body in the gown. As she walked over to where he sat, she turned to him as she looked up at him.</p> <p>"You're not so bad-looking," she said.</p> <p>"Thank you," he said, putting his arms around her and pulling her close.</p> <p>"My husband is still working on some project I'm working on on the West Coast."</p> <p>"Oh?"</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"What's that?"</p> <p>"He's taking a job that's supposed to be open for a few weeks. He will be moving away over the summer. He's really excited."</p> <p>"What is going on?"</p> <p>"He's going to be doing a year full of seminars in Chicago. The company is going to take him over there with a whole different perspective. He's going to start working at the library with another business that's actually a software company."</p> <p>"Wow. I can't believe it. That's something," she said, reaching up and taking his face in her hands.</p> <p>"I can't believe it either," he said. "When I saw you and your friend today, I thought," he said, putting his tongue back in his mouth, then pulled back and smiled.</p> <p>"Really?" she asked, leaning back and putting her hands on her knees.</p> <p>"Really," he answered. "It was amazing."</p> <p>"Well, do you have to leave?" she asked, putting her hands on hers as she looked up at him.</p> <p>"Not really. I need to keep running and I have to do some research on how to keep myself active."</p> <p>"Is this really going to be your last time?" she asked.</p> <p>"What do you think?" he replied.</p> <p>"I...I don't know...this has been a big step...I guess it probably isn't your kind of thing, but..." she stammered, giving up.</p> <p>"Well, for all I know, we can stop at a bar and have a few celebratory drinks on the way home."</p> <p>"Well, that sounds good to me," she said, leaning back and reaching up to kiss him once more. "Let's finish our beers and take our leave."</p> <p>"What are you talking about?" Eric asked, pulling her back into his arms.</p> <p>Melody gave him an exaggerated look as she put her hands on his chest and brought her lips to where she wanted. He kissed her back, and she returned the kiss, then pulled away just far enough to put her tongue to the bottom of his mouth. They stood there briefly and took a few steps to the elevator, only then did the doors close. The ride to the bar was short, but neither felt uncomfortable as they walked toward the bar.</p> <p>"What's thisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
