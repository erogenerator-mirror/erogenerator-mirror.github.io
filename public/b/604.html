I'm so not good in that area."</p> <p>"Don't mind me. Here, let me massage that for you." I lifted her hands to my warm hands and began rubbing them all over her arms and hands. She closed her eyes as the sensations washed through her body, and sighed softly as her warm hands surrounded my hands, slowly, softly, lightly. "You're really good at this," I told her, "I won't have you get sore if I rub that all over your body." She smiled at me as I began moving to her upper back and lower back, paying special attention to her upper thighs, and felt her body relax and relax as her body began to respond to my touch.</p> <p>My left hand began to move down her back. "You have this great looking back," I told her. "I love that skin. It's so soft looking under there." I moved one hand to her right hip, gently exploring her skin with my fingertips. "You're really really cute," I said, "this is one of those body parts you can get excited too." She blushed, but let me continue my caresses until she had a smile on her face in response before returning my caress to her shoulders, neck and upper chest. I massaged her shoulders as she breathed quietly, and then moved down to her chest.</p> <p>"You have great skin," I said, "it's soft and smooth just like it needed a bit of massage and a little rubbing." I rubbed her bare left breast with both hands, cupping it in my palms as I pulled the breast upwards, and pulled it lightly downward on its own. I moved over to her stomach and made several trips down over her right breast, feeling her nipples harden at the contact of my fingers. Taking my left hand, I pressed my finger hard against her clit, then used it to push my middle finger against her pussy, slipping it easily inside. "There, that's what I want to do," I said, as I massaged my way up and over her left breast to her belly. I repeated the process on her right breast, and then moved back down to her left side.</p> <p>Her hands were covering her face, as she had done her neck. I bent down and kissed her lightly on the lips, teasing them again. I felt her body relax. "I'm just getting warmed up," I told her. I moved one of her hands to my neck, and let her hands go. "We're ready now," I said, as I pushed her back to the sofa, and removed her robe, making her lie back. I had no sooner removed them than my hands were back on her body, and she moaned in anticipation of what I was about to do next. I let my fingers slide down her side, over her belly to her outer thighs, where they continued their upward journey as I raised her legs to rest them on my shoulders, and reached around her hips with my fingertips to slip them underneath her panties, to pull them down. I slid them down over her calves, and off quickly. She closed her eyes and moaned again, as I lifted her feet and slid them to her ankles, and then she raised them, and set them to her waist. "How does that feel?" I asked, as I felt her thighs, and felt my hand slide up to her sex.</p> <p>"It's a lot different than I used to think," she told me. "It's really warm down here."</p> <p>As much as I liked watching her body respond to the touches of my hands and fingers along with her own as I made love to her, I had a new idea. "Let's take that off," I told her, and she nodded her agreement, so I let the straps fall to the floor as I moved my thumbs to her hips. I undid the button of her shorts, and then slid them down to the floor with her shorts. I pulled her panties down, and turned my body so I could push her underwear on over her hips and lower abdomen, and then slip them off her ankles.</p> <p>I stood up, looking down over her body, her eyes still closed, and saw that beautiful, sexy, slender body in my hands again. I was so pleased I didn't know quite how to begin, so I just had to have her. "Lie down," I told her.</p> <p>She did so eagerly as I held the back of her shoulders, and pushed her body down toward hers so she could lie on her side. She looked me in the eyes as I slid over her body, pulling myself down over her, and laying my head on her breasts. I leaned down to kiss her lips, and she put her own mouth on mine, and kissed me backâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
