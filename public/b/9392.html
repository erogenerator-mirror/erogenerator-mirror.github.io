"I'm completely enraptured."</p> <p>"We need to get you there," he said. "I'm here helping you as we go."</p> <p>Karen nodded. She felt elated as he pulled into the street behind her car. He held her hand as they walked along the curb with his hands all over her. Their bodies were pressed, their breathing ragged as they walked. Finally, they stopped at a stop light on the side. He pulled back from her and pulled her into him. The light turned to green and they turned back. Karen was confused, she felt as if they were on a deserted street. Finally they made it to a stop off the main road. The street was only level with what looked to be a high-rise building that was in the middle of the street.</p> <p>"It is very quiet here," he said.</p> <p>Karen's body was trembling. She had never felt so alone and alone, so many strangers at once. It was as if she could almost feel their gaze on her. Her own body knew what it was doing. Her mind was racing. She was afraid she might be too overwhelmed by fear. She could not think of being with him. She wanted to run. She couldn't stop trembling as they reached the building.</p> <p>It seemed like forever but it was hours before they made it to the elevator. He followed her with his arm at the small of her back, pushing her against the wall. He pushed the button for her floor and turned to look at her.</p> <p>"My name is Bill," he said, "and you will address as 'Miss Karen' all the time when we are in the meeting room."</p> <p>Karen looked down at her hands. "Yes, I'm sorry," she murmured. "You don't know me that well."</p> <p>"Neither do I," he whispered, pulling her tighter. "You are Karen. Miss Karen. What do we do tonight, Karen?'</p> <p>Karen looked up at him. She could feel tears streaming down her face so quickly. He was so handsome. She wanted to curl up with him and hide in his arms. She felt vulnerable and wanted to tell him she loved him. Instead she just looked down.</p> <p>"We have to get to the door," she murmured quietly, her heart pounding.</p> <p>They stood in the elevator lobby staring at the faces of the men in the room. He turned her from his arms and she fell back against him. She felt so vulnerable. Their foreheads rested on his shoulder. Her knees felt weak. She wanted to hug him closer than they had ever been before.</p> <p>Soon they exited the elevator and found themselves standing in the room of an apartment. She had to find a way to get them to the room without breaking the hug. Her hands were shaky. They needed a good night's rest, too.</p> <p>With her back to him, he leaned his head down and kissed the top of her head.</p> <p>"You really are a very beautiful girl," he said.</p> <p>"Thanks," she said, her whole body shaking with emotion.</p> <p>"I'm glad you like me, Miss Karen, I'm sure you are too. But you are not alone for tonight."</p> <p>And with that he turned her around to sit down in his lap. His hands were still pressed firmly against her shoulders and it felt so good to kiss her there. She felt so safe and beautiful. His hands felt so good, touching skin and hair and neck and ears. And his touch was amazing to her.</p> <p>"Let's get you into bed," he said. "We'll go straight to the bedroom."</p> <p>He took her hand and led her through the small livingroom and into some kind of bedroom. When they reached the bed he stopped her. "I want you to undress and get into bed right now," he whispered.</p> <p>Karen looked like a frightened animal. She didn't say anything. She had never done anything like it before in her life, although she had watched a number of videos. She was completely out of her mind, completely out of her rational way of thinking.</p> <p>And with her eyes still focused on his, she stripped off her clothing. She felt her entire being shake. Her bare legs were trembling and felt hot. She undulated her hips as she tossed her shoes off her feet. She felt vulnerable and beautiful and felt as if she could do a lot of things for him.</p> <p>She watched him as he undressed and stripped into his bed. Her knees went weak and she was trembling all over. She found herself holding the edge of the bed in an effort not to fall over. She watched him as he stripped out of his clothes.</p> <p>He looked so masculine. Karen knew she would miss him. He was handsomeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
