This was one of the first times I ever called him that. The reason I had done it before was I didn't feel comfortable calling him a little princess. My family knew I was different and just didn't like me calling them by my full name.</p> <p>"And I am a princess, too," I said, "but I'm not trying to be. I'm not the type to try and change or do anything you don't like."</p> <p>"You don't have to worry about that, Lacey," he replied. "I have a good sense of humor. Plus, you're the prettiest girl I've ever known and I love you."</p> <p>"Thank you, I really enjoyed seeing you," I said, "I didn't know we'd become friends right away."</p> <p>'You're the prettiest girl I've ever known' was probably the most accurate description. He still did have an air of confidence about him now and he wasn't hiding any of it. I was beginning to believe he'd never go another day without asking permission before he was married and that would be the last reason I wanted to marry him.</p> <p>"We'll talk about that later," I agreed.</p> <p>"I hope we can get together soon," he replied. He didn't sound it either. It was just the both of us; that was all.</p> <p>'I can't wait until the end of my marriage,' I thought, 'but for now I have to move on and work on getting my life out of my head'.</p> <p>"I've got two people to go home to," I said, still a little annoyed with myself from my earlier outburst. I couldn't help but smile when he smiled back. I didn't mean to be disrespectful and I did think he was a nice guy, but I didn't feel that way about him. I didn't like it, either, but I was used to it.</p> <p>"I have to go home tonight and plan to be at the office for a few hours before I go back to work on my new idea," he said, smiling at me and walking me toward the door. "See you tomorrow, baby."</p> <p>The last few minutes of the night dragged on and on. We sat there awkwardly for a little while until he got up off the sofa and went to get dressed. He got all his clothes from his dresser and went out the front door.</p> <p>'He's probably going to be back there for a while at the office,' I thought, 'and I'm going to miss that, too.'</p> <p>'I'm going to miss him too,' I think to myself, 'but the best thing would be if the night's still young.'</p> <p>I just had a very difficult time keeping the tears from the back of my throat when I got home. I cried into the pillow in front of the living room watching the tears roll down my cheeks. I was still trying to decide whether I liked him or not and whether I liked it or not. I was still trying to make up my mind for my past with him. He must have taken an awful, horrible beating. He did make a special man out of me because I could barely get over it. His anger didn't stop from being that much bigger than any of his other relationships.</p> <p>The following days dragged on and on. I tried to work on my project but I couldn't find any sort of solution to the problem of my situation. On the third day when I went to work, I saw an attractive young woman coming toward me. It wasn't a look of sadness or sadness; it was a look of lust. I felt a little jealous when she got closer, however, and she said, "I'm so glad you made it home. I know you must be getting lonely now, honey, and you look a little tired. You never really slept last night."</p> <p>"I'm not as tired this morning," I lied.</p> <p>"I was sleeping a dream, too," she explained "And no, it was a dream. Come to think of it, do you like getting out of bed early?"</p> <p>I could barely breathe. My heart felt like it was going to make it leap off my chest. I didn't know how to answer. Maybe I was too tired to tell her I was still lying.</p> <p>"No, I still haven't slept a sleep," I said, thinking I was dreaming again.</p> <p>"Oh, you're definitely not one of the tired ones," she said as she gave me a hug. "Maybe you didn't want to sleep until today."</p> <p>"I was pretty well used to being tired," I said. "I'm still just not used to it all."</p> <p>"Well, whatever your body wants you to fall asleep on," she replied with aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
