But I know this was the time to move on from the stupid thing! I shoulda gotten my act together. Let's face it, the past is past! If I just had a friend now, the girl would never have to go. And I do still love her... I might also have to take a chance on my marriage, even when all my friends can't get it up anymore.</p> <p>There's nothing I'd like better, so I had to do something. I was a pretty good looking guy and the girls were hot and wanted to be around me anyway, so there was no reason to be a stranger. I decided that it would be a good idea to get my marriage back up and get myself into shape. So, I made myself as a man.</p> <p>* * * * * *</p> <p>"What should I do?" I was on my second run at the track today. Today's starting game is Monday. I got pretty tired of playing last weekend's game and headed home.</p> <p>The drive was boring. Every time I pulled towards my house, my mind would wander to the upcoming events. When I pulled up to the house, I could see that the house was a disaster. The sun was beginning to set, and the breeze was blowing through it as a cool breeze. The trees were trimmed, and the grass was thin, giving a breeze that reminded me of those time camping trips where it'd be a good time to get my own stuff.</p> <p>I grabbed my stuff, got out of the car and headed down the block. I was feeling a little bit nervous about what was about to happen. We'd been in a couple of relationships and I had only had one before, so I wasn't sure if I wanted to live that way now. And so, I had to be a little extra in the relationship. But, there was no way in hell that I was willing to commit to anything less.</p> <p>As I made my way into the house, I began to notice the house. It was about a half mile from the gym, and there was plenty of room to sit around the house to get a little better. I knocked, no answered, just a knock on the door.</p> <p>"Are you still going?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm sorry I'm in such a rush. I really need to get myself out of this stupid house."</p> <p>"I've fixed it up before. I have my keys in my pocket. I live down the street a ways. Why don't we go have some coffee together? I'd like to go out this evening."</p> <p>"That's nice of you. That would be perfect."</p> <p>We sat at my kitchen counter, and my phone rang. I picked up the phone hoping that it was my girlfriend. I answered it to see who the hell it was.</p> <p>"Hello?" I asked.</p> <p>"Hey, its Rachel. I need you to come home on Saturday. I had to take a break."</p> <p>"Uh, yeah, of course. I'll be there. I'll come up tomorrow afternoon, if that's okay."</p> <p>"Sure! I'll be there. It's about a quarter to three."</p> <p>"Uh... good. I'll be there about 9. I'll bring you back for breakfast. Would you like me to pick you up first, or shall I just come over later?"</p> <p>"Uhh... okay, let me grab my keys and I'll be there, okay?"</p> <p>"Sure. Now if you don't mind, I'm going to grab my car now and head over to meet you here."</p> <p>"Okay. See you in a couple of hours. Bye."</p> <p>I hung up the phone, sat there for a minute just staring at it. What, did Rachel suddenly come home all nervous and not telling me that she'd be there late, or maybe not? "Holy Shit." I muttered to myself. Well... one day that doesn't happen.</p> <p>My head snapped to the present and I sat back down. I got up and grabbed my coffee and headed to the front door. I quickly checked and then put my car back into the garage, and started my car. After making sure that I had my keys and car locked up, I walked back down the street. I was just about to go back inside when I got a text message from Rachel on my cellphone from the house.</p> <p>'I'm coming home now.'</p> <p>'See you soon. See you soon.'</p> <p>I slammed my phone into the floor, pulled my keys out and threw their lock down. I walked up to the house and rang the door but it was answered only by the voice of Rachelâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
