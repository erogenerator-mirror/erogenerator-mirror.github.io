We had dated three time for about three weeks now, and had started experimenting with each other when she was drunk. Once I had decided that I wanted a relationship with her at all costs, we had set out to have a serious and physical relationship, if you will. It started when the wine was gone and she found a bottle in a small box. She picked it up and said, "It's beautiful," as she took a sip from it. Her eyes went wide as she said, "I don't know." I turned her face to me and said, "You don't have to be embarrassed to drink to get you started; I mean, I am willing to help anyway I can." It wasn't a question. It was a statement. I turned her toward me, and, as I wrapped my arms around her, I pulled her into me, and when the kiss started, it was the most passionate kiss of the whole night. I wanted to take one slow step now, so I kissed her again. I could feel her growing against me, and as I opened my mouth, she pulled me to her, and then we continued in the kiss, with me holding onto her as she wrapped her arms around me.</p> <p>We broke the kiss and stared at each other for a minute as we looked into each other's eyes. I pulled back a bit and said, "You are so amazing tonight."</p> <p>She smiled, and leaned forward onto the couch, pulling me to her. Our kiss was not hurried, but it was still passionate as we kissed for what must have been a wonderful five minutes.</p> <p>As I reached behind to undo her bra strap, I said, "No bra,"</p> <p>She laughed, "No bra."</p> <p>When her bra fell to the floor, her breasts popped out from the cups as if offering themselves up to me. I knelt down on the floor, and started licking and sucking on her nipples, one after the other. Her hands were caressing me as I worked her breasts. Her nipples were as hard as pebbles and were extending straight up, as I licked and sucked at them. I lifted one off her breast and sucked the other one, running the nails of my hand up the crease formed in her butt-cheek, pulling it ever so gently downward. When I touched her pussy for the second time, she jumped. I ran a finger up the slit, and could feel the slippery wetness of her juices as I touched her. When she lifted her legs out of the way, I took my tongue and started licking her clit, flicking it with the flat of my tongue as my fingers worked her pussy.</p> <p>It took barely two minutes and she had another thundering orgasm followed by another, harder than the first. She had grabbed my hair, and was trying to pull it up and get it over my face as I continued to lick and suck her. I did this a little more often than necessary, to make her come as much as possible, I would say. I kept running my tongue up and down her pussy, and sucked her swollen clit between my lips. It was getting near the time that we had both climaxed, once she had, she sat back on the couch, as I stood up, kissing her as I did this. I said, "I want you to suck me just as hard and lick me in the same way, if you like."</p> <p>She smiled and said, "Yes, I like." And started licking the head of my cock, paying particular attention to the area behind it. She had a lot of tongue work done. It felt great, as good a sensation as any.</p> <p>This went on for another two minutes, before I asked her, "Do you plan to put me in my butt?"</p> <p>"I just thought we could do something about that later if that is what you want."</p> <p>She stood and I was amazed at the sight that I had seen in the locker room earlier that day. I pulled her to me and we kissed again, with a lot more passion this time. She was moving toward me as we kissed, her breasts swinging with the rhythm. I reached between her legs and started rubbing her clit, in rhythm with her thrusts back and forth.</p> <p>"Do you like it as much as I do?"</p> <p>"I love it as much as you do. I could get used to that, a lot."</p> <p>I was getting harder, and I knew it wouldn't take long. I lifted her off the couch, which forced us down until she had me in the middle. I could reach her pussy from the couch, as well, but had to stay on the floor. She leaned over me and I put her hands on the coffee table and slid the restâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
