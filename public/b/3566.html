Your dress is beautiful!" the redhead said. She paused for effect and moved around the sofa, so that her chest pressed against the fabric.</p> <p>"I think you need shoes. It's quite chilly." The redhead turned and pulled a pair of white, lacy, stilettos from an adjacent wardrobe and handed them to her sister. "It's the closest thing to what I usually wear." She said, and then, as if choreographed, she began dancing again for the blonde. The two girls laughed as the slender blonde began to gyrate her hips to the beat of the music, her back to them and her own body writhing to the beat of the music.</p> <p>Once she finished performing for the two girls she held out her hands. "I'm really glad to see you both." She said and smiled at the faces of her two brothers.</p> <p>"Yeah, I feel the same," Michael said, and they all clapped. The tall blonde reached behind her and took out a pair of shoes from a nearby dressing table.</p> <p>"Do you guys look after your sister, now?" she asked. The sisters each turned and looked at her and nodded. "It's just about time, anyway." The tall blonde replied, and her sister shrugged.</p> <p>"Come on," she said, and took their hands. They walked through the house to the living room. Once inside the pair of bedrooms their arms went around each other's waist, pressing their bodies firmly together as they shared a deep, passionate kiss.</p> <p>As they broke their embrace, the twins looked at each other, wondering what they should do, with their sister.</p> <p>"We'll have to make room for ourselves, won't we, boys?" she whispered to them.</p> <p>Before Michael could say anything, she pushed him away, and he found himself face to face with her, still naked from beneath her wedding night dress. She was smiling at him through her eyelashes, and her brown eyes moved up to his face. She moved her fingers to his chest, and pushed him back.</p> <p>"Come with me, guys," she said, and they moved together.</p> <p>The two brothers were already at her side, their hands around each other's waist as they moved closer to their sisters so that they could see her. Michael reached to her, taking a single finger from the top of her thigh as he looked into her eyes. He moved his hands to her, cupped her breasts and squeezed them together.</p> <p>"You're perfect." He said and then kissed her lips, and he squeezed them hard. "Mmm," she said, and then kissed his lip. She pressed her lips harder to his and kissed him with a passion that surprised both of them. Michael felt her hips press against him and heard her gasp for air before she pulled him back into a kiss.</p> <p>They kissed hard, their tongues probing each other's mouth, their breath mingling and their lips locked together, their breath mingling as they kissed. Their fingers squeezed and massaged each other's bodies as their tongues danced and pulled on one another.</p> <p>Their hands found each other's breasts, pinching each nipple, and gently pulling them. Michael felt her breasts bulge and the nipples get hard as she pulled him to her with the same passion. The fingers of her other hand stroked his cock, and he pushed his hips up to get her hand on his cock. All Michael could think about was how much his sister was turning him on and he moaned with pleasure. Her hand rubbed his cock while he kissed her and felt her breasts jiggle.</p> <p>Eventually, Michael's hands slid down her slender body. They squeezed her ass, and he slid his hands lower to her mons and pulled it out of her dress.</p> <p>"Shit," he said, and then kissed the top of her mound. The blonde let out a shuddering sigh as he kissed her mound with the tip of his tongue. He kissed her in the hollow of her groin and felt her body tremble at his touch. She smelled sweet and delicious, and he had a hard time resisting how incredible it was to kiss her on the lips.</p> <p>When she felt his tongue on her mound, she let out several low, breathy moans as he pressed his tongue flat from the tip of her clit down to the base of her pussy lips and back up again.</p> <p>She leaned back and smiled at him in the darkness. "It tastes so good, Michael...you should taste it."</p> <p>"Yeah, I should," the shorter man said. "You're wet, and you'll taste so good."</p> <p>"Then maybe not." She agreed, and moved closer to him. She pressed her lips softly against his and pressed herself against him.
