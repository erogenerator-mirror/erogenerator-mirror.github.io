She rolled her eyes and smiled at me.</p> <p>I leaned over to pull the cart from the rack that was hanging on the wall of cars.</p> <p>"Yeah," she said, rolling her eyes. "I got something in the back to take a look around, and you would be more than welcome to check it out!" she laughed and headed out of the store.</p> <p>I took another long look at the store. "Can I do something for you?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh, there isn't anything on that display I would want. I'd even like to try something else if it's not too much of a problem."</p> <p>I smiled knowing that her interest in something new and exciting would be obvious to her.</p> <p>We left this evening around midnight. I had never felt that comfortable about anything before. I knew that the world in general and her in particular were different from men to women. She was different just from me; it was as if her personality was different. I knew that I liked her just the same. I wondered if she could really be interested in someone else.</p> <p>It was late the following day when we went to get ready for our party to come, and she was as excited to be at the party as I was. I'm a little apprehensive about the night. What if someone caught us? What if they told the police and everything ended up that way? What if they did the whole thing and we were caught and thrown out of our house? We didn't have to do anything. We couldn't say anything.</p> <p>We went inside. It was quite dark, and there weren't any lights to be seen. The party seemed to last an hour or so. The house was well lit, and some of the activities would be held in the ballroom in the lobby.</p> <p>I could hear that many people were standing around talking with each other, and a few were coming in. There were couples on the dance floor and a bunch of girls dancing with girls and guys. All sorts of things went on in the background as each couple talked.</p> <p>I was surprised by how much attention and attention was shown on me as I walked by the group in my white high heels. One of the other girls leaned in and gave me a friendly good-bye kiss from behind, and smiled at me from behind. I felt a flutter of jealousy.</p> <p>We went outside to where people were standing around a small table in the main ballroom. I took her in my arms and started kissing her and playing with her breast and nipple. She put her arms on my shoulders and pressed me to her. I could smell her perfume, and she turned around and bent over in front of me. She pushed my head onto my back, and took my cock into her mouth in one smooth motion and started to suck and bite at it. The pleasure of it made me moan. She had moved her right hand to my crotch, and started rubbing my clit.</p> <p>"Oh, do it," she said, and pressed herself down harder, trying to keep the tip of my cock in her mouth. Just a little at a time. The excitement and heat, the feeling that she knew how to stimulate me, the feeling that I wanted so much, gave just a little push at the cock head.</p> <p>"Oh, Oh, yes!!" I cried out "I'm going to cum! Oh, yes!!" I cried in frustration of not having her tongue deep in me during the time she had sucked me off.</p> <p>We both came in her mouth. She licked me clean as she continued to play with my cock, and when I was done, she moved to the bar and ordered a bottle of champagne to share with me. We sat and talked for a little while then walked away. She leaned in to kiss me with much passion. I was in heaven as she pushed me up against the wall that had fallen down about three feet below us. We kissed for a few minutes, and then broke the contact.</p> <p>She stood up, and turned around to face me again.</p> <p>"I haven't had such a good fuck in months," she said, with a sultry smile on her face. She turned back and bent over a little again on her knees. She held her breasts with her forearms, giving me a perfect shot at her nipples while standing up straight. I could smell and see that there were other people on the dance floor. We went and stood facing one another again.</p> <p>We leaned back with our arms around each other, and she reached down and took my cock once again with her hand, and slowly and smoothly stroked it up and down. I had completely gotten over my fear of being caught, and I liked the feeling of her hand on me so much that I could cumâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
