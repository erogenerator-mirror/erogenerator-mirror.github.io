I thought I'd call you for awhile, if I can call you too. So I can tell you I just got my new little girl back and I had to tell you so you can have a place to stay for a couple of weeks. I'm sorry I don't have a lot of money on me," I confessed. I knew it didn't work out so, I just needed to pay her back for what I did for her, since she was so cute and sweet and everything. But of course, all this was too soon for us, and if what was going on with her hadn't happened, her reaction would be like what happened to me.</p> <p>"You were a little drunk, didn't you sweetie? I heard you're having fun. I could probably stay for a couple of days if you're good. It's almost two by now. Why don't you drive back home? It'll be hard for me to tell you where I am now...so we can talk about it later. I have an errand to run to," she said.</p> <p>"I don't even know your name, sweetie. This was your boyfriend," I said laughing.</p> <p>"Not the guy you're expecting. He had to pick someone up at a bar. Now, he's just going to drive him," she said again. "It'll be a little better for you, I promise," she assured me.</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess it is," I said. "Okay, let's go, and I'll tell you everything, okay?" I asked her. She agreed and we went out.</p> <p>I followed Katie back home as she headed off to shower and change. I knew she'd be tired, but maybe, now she could talk to me. I decided to take a walk, just in case and we may just get to know each other. I could only hope that I didn't get kicked out for being a drunken asshole, but we'll see.</p> <p>We ran into her car and I was surprised how big it was.</p> <p>"I was only ten feet from the door so far. I'm surprised. What have I gotten myself into?" I asked her. Katie and I were laughing as she backed out of the driveway and got in the back seat with me.</p> <p>"So sweetie, do you think I can pull you out now after what I just heard you saying," she asked.</p> <p>"I think I can pull this around until I find out," I laughed. "It can't be helped..." I said as I opened the car door and got out.</p> <p>"Are you sure about this? She asked.</p> <p>"Sure," I assured her.</p> <p>"You're right, it can be a lot of fun. I'm glad I was up with this when I got it back in the house. That guy I told you about was right. He was so nice," Katie said.</p> <p>After I got in the car with her, I started thinking that the only reason she could be with another guy was because her new friend had an older boyfriend.</p> <p>"Oh, sweetie, you just aren't my type. I don't think I can take much more of this," she said.</p> <p>"Okay, I understand. Just trust me, there's a lot of beer in those beer bottles. You can drink the whole bottle if you want. I don't care how many, and I'm not saying I don't love it, but I want to feel you around me, no matter who I'm drinking next." I said. "You can drink all the way up to the second half for now. In case you want to catch some flies on them."</p> <p>"You know, I think I'm going to like the beer, it's all I've had for awhile. I guess it's just a little too bitter," Katie said.</p> <p>"Come on, I need to get away from home and change before I go home," I teased her.</p> <p>"Okay, if you want to have a little fun before you go, but you've got to be there by ten tomorrow," she said.</p> <p>"And, I'll still be sober about it," I teased. "You can start by taking advantage of me. I'm only twenty-five and I'm not a virgin...well, not now that I am. If I take advantage, I'll be doing things that I want to do for a long, long time. Do you think you can convince me to do some stuff for you and your boyfriends? You're more drunk than I am, and you obviously don't know what I'm talking about," I said laughing.</p> <p>Katie's face turned red. What the hell was wrong with me? I had never been with a virginâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
