Do you understand?"</p> <p>"Yes, my little slave!" Mary exclaimed after she recovered from her sudden outburst and stood up. "Let's take my dress off!"</p> <p>Mary unzipped her dress and slowly let it fall to her ankles before stepping out of it so that she could step out of it. With the dress and her panties still on, Mary quickly got up onto the bed and sat down. She looked over at Dave, standing with his legs in the air, his hands moving over his body as if searching for something to help him finish, as he moved one, then two and then all eight inches. He watched Mary as she sat there, her hips inching their way towards his face as if inviting him. She raised her eyebrows at Dave, who didn't seem to hear her. He looked over at her, his face reddening as he saw her watching him. She stood up and moved over to where Dave stood, her legs in a split on the bed. Her hands gently touched his shoulders as she gently kissed his cheek, then his lips. She gently lowered herself, laying it in his lap as she kissed his mouth. Their lips parted slightly as their eyes met. She closed her eyes, letting his hand rub her back softly. He turned his head towards the door and walked into his room as it closed. After a few steps he stopped and turned towards the bathroom. "I have to get ready." he said. The look of disappointment and embarrassment on his face was unmistakable as he started to head toward his bed, and started to leave the room. Mary's voice was a whisper above his heart. "Now slave..."</p> <p>The tone of the question was as if she were saying no to him and his answer was simple. He turned to hers, looking into her eyes. "...Do you want to continue our relationship?" He asked as he walked towards her.</p> <p>She smiled as she pulled her hand away from his, bringing it down on his thigh and placing it against his crotch. "Yes, of course, my Master!" she said as she leaned forward and pressed her lips tightly around his. The kiss was gentle but the intensity of the kiss drove him wild. She pressed her hips against him as she slid her hand up his shorts to feel him harden. The heat of the kiss drove him crazy with desire for her.</p> <p>"Mary..." Dave began. Again she closed her eyes, but he couldn't think of what to say. She opened her eyes again, and placed her right hand against his shorts. He felt her hand on his cock, her warm soft fingers wrapped around the length of him. It was hot as she moved.</p> <p>"Oh Master..." she said to him as she looked up in his eyes. His head moved away slightly and his eyes opened as well. "I'm sorry Master!" she softly said before smiling.</p> <p>"I know you are my slave, but to answer your question... Yes, I want to continue our relationship with you."</p> <p>"Yes Master!" she said with a smile. "But you will not be allowed to touch me... until you are married and have a child."</p> <p>"Yes, your right of first-class service is over."</p> <p>She smiled again at Dave's words, placing her hand on his thigh. He looked down, realizing that she was not wearing his birthday suit, as well as the one from a photo shoot. They had done both before, and knew how to please each other for as long as the weather would allow. She smiled back at him, before returning her hand to her lap, bringing it back up quickly. Her eyes were glazed over as she looked down in his eyes.</p> <p>"Do you wish to please me?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes Mary!" he replied before taking a breath.</p> <p>"Do you want us to continue?" she asked softly.</p> <p>Dave wanted to answer her, but could not find the words to do so. His thoughts were racing as a thought entered his head. He tried to think of some way out of this at the hands of his beautiful and sensuous wife, but the more the day wore on, the hornier he got. He decided he would go with the first option of taking their relationship from now on.</p> <p>"Yes, I wish you had always wanted us to stay one step closer to each other."</p> <p>She stared back at him as she spoke, and then turned her face to him. She closed her eyes and leaned her head closer together for a second. She was breathing quickly now, as her lips touched his, their taste and texture sending jolts down his entire body.</p> <p>"I know this is all very new to you," she whispered before she put her lips on his again, pushing her tongue inside his mouth.</p> <p>"Yesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
