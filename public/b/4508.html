At some point he got up, and had dressed quickly and was ready to go when I said something that I didn't think was good, and I was relieved.</p> <p>"Don't go out for those holidays," I said. "They'll be wonderful.</p> <p>That was good.</p> <p>I got up as well.</p> <p>I said, "I have some bad news for you, and I hope you can join me."</p> <p>He looked a little hurt, and then he nodded.</p> <p>"Oh, no thanks," he said. "That's not good news. Do you want to go home?"</p> <p>I was still smiling. The truth is, a lot of things came up. His wife had died, or left it after the first time we went out for a while, and while she was alive she was still single, and we had a good life.</p> <p>I had just asked him to go with me, to get the tickets, and he was happy to do that. The problem wasn't that we were single. We just thought it would be a nice, nice surprise. But a big present from a big guy in work called us. He promised to take care of the tickets, and I told him that it wasn't a problem. If he was happy to go with me, maybe I should take care of his wife.</p> <p>I was still smiling.</p> <p>So he took off his work jacket, which was a little tight. I smiled, knowing he had nothing on underneath; he just looked very nice. He looked hot as a picture, and I was pleased with that.</p> <p>He took off his coat and threw that into the hamper, and he stood there with his shirt off, just a small one. I reached up under his t-shirt and slid my hands up. They were warm, and I lifted the shirt up and slid my hand down over his left nipple. It didn't take long to get his hard cock out.</p> <p>"Mmm," I whispered. "It's nice and hard. So nice and big."</p> <p>"Yes," was a soft mumbled. "But I can't take care of it... it's a nice gift for you."</p> <p>I kissed the softness of him, a soft, warm kiss. I slid a hand up his thigh, and down his leg, slowly, and I could feel him shaking, as if he were trying to get the contact of a hand around his cock to stay hard. I kissed him again, still not touching his lips to stop him. I took his hand in mine, felt him, and let him feel my fingers. It only gave his hand a little squeeze. I pulled his hand back to me, and he let me feel him, even if he was shaking, and it was hard to know what he was feeling.</p> <p>I looked at him and I could see that the first thing that had made things difficult was that the hand under his t-shirt was actually rubbing against his arm, moving a little.</p> <p>"Do you want me?" I whispered.</p> <p>He was silent, and he nodded.</p> <p>We went out to the car, and he got in the drivers' side, and I sat on the seat next to him.</p> <p>I whispered, "Are you sure you want me?"</p> <p>He didn't answer. He just leaned his head down on my shoulder, closed his eyes, and I closed mine, and we had the best night of our lives and life.</p> <p>I know it's not an ideal thing, but I do love him, and I'm glad we had this moment of passion and pleasure.</p> <p>I don't want to go any further to the next chapter, but I feel like it should be a different chapter, so just skip ahead, then keep with it, or read on, it is a nice chapter, and all are good, or should be, and it's time to start the next chapter. But just to keep with the stories I wrote this weekâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
