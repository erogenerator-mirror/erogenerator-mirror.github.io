His hands cupped her breasts, his middle finger stroking her nipple through her shirt. The skin of her breasts was so soft, her flesh smooth where it rubbed against his fingertips. He lifted onto his toes and began to kiss her, moving one of his own free hands down to squeeze her buttocks. It felt warm, almost as if they were covered in goosebump muck... they felt even slimmer and softer. Her skin was silky smooth, slick with the moisture that oozed from her pussy, and the feel of the flesh around her thighs against his fingers made him hot, his dick was straining the thin cloth of his panties. They both moaned into each other's lips, their mouths pressing together hard, their tongues probing deeply into each other's mouths. Their mouths were locked in a fierce embrace, and it didn't take long to break the kiss, and they stood up, their feet sliding up and down on the carpet. One of his hands remained on her bottom, kneading and squeezing it, while his other hand slipped the zipper of his jeans down, slowly exposing his cock. A hand reached up to stroke the shaft beneath his boxers, sliding it down to cup his balls in his hand.</p> <p>Melanie looked up and smiled, "You know," she said, "if we were in the woods, we'd be doing this right here, or even closer together."</p> <p>Steve's dick was as hard as iron, his member already standing out. He pulled his feet off the floor of his panties and kicked them into the corner of his room. He sat down on the edge of the bed, still cupping both breasts in his hands, while Melanie continued staring at his cock. She reached behind her, unbuttoned her top, then let it drop to the floor. Stepping out of her skirt and the panties she tossed them across the room, she threw them to the back of the closet, then turned to face me and bent over the bed. She pushed her hair out of her face, revealing a small, tight little butt that was perfect, round and inviting. She brought her hands up and placed them on either side of her, looking back at me over her shoulder. I could see the smooth valley of her ass between her thighs, the dimples at the base of her back just visible in the dim light of the room. I could see her pussy peeking out from underneath, damp with juice.</p> <p>"Take off your bra," she said, smiling at me, "I already sucked you dry."</p> <p>I shook my head no. I didn't want to. I was so excited. She did what she was asked, so I leaned over the bed, and slipped the straps of her bra off her shoulders, allowing it to slide down her arms, pooling in her hands with her bra straps. She dropped them to the floor, then raised her arms, allowing the straps to fall from her arms. She had beautiful tits, I could already see the little pink nipples swelling and hardening as Melanie continued to look at me, her smile growing as the air conditioning in the room came on. She reached over and took my hand, standing up on the bed next to me. "I have a surprise for you, you naughty man, one for her."</p> <p>Steve lifted himself off the bed and started to move toward Melanie. But Melanie put her finger over his lips, stopping him.</p> <p>"Be quiet stud," she said to me, "You don't want to get caught here. You get me naked again, and I get a surprise, and you don't get to be able to watch." She leaned in close, the warm breath felt delicious, and her lips brushed mine lightly. She ran her hand down across my cheek, then kissed lightly in the middle of the lips. When she pulled away, a trail of saliva ran down my chin to my neck, where she blew it to me, then kissed me again, and this time longer. "Now you are mine."</p> <p>Steve's lips left mine, then went right for my neck, and Melanie's hand went to the back of my head, pulling my mouth to her, kissing me with a renewed intensity. Her tongue pushed into my mouth, her teeth nipping at my teeth, probing and probing with a renewed passion.</p> <p>Then she broke away from the kiss, and went to stand, turning so that she was facing away from me. I could see her panties pulled taut across her buttocks, her legs parted. With one fluid motion, she pulled her thong away from her skin, letting the pink fabric fall in a wet heap at the base of her spine. She turned to face me again, and I could see the dark shadow of her pubic hair. Melanie smiled at me, then put one knee on each end of the bed, then stepped aside.</p> <p>"You won't beâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
