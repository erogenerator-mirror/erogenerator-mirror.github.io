Please don't. I mean, that would be kind."</p> <p>He smiled and shook his head. "No, that won't be a problem at all. That would be nice. It's not that. It's just that I'd like to do it myself, to let you know what I mean."</p> <p>They both shared a laugh. Her chest fell slightly as she turned her head to face him and she looked so sad and vulnerable right now. He took a few long moments gazing into her eyes. He knew that if she were to meet his expectations to be with him, she would be a better and better partner. He was in a relationship. A partner had to let loose and be ready for whatever it was to come. He sighed. "I have to be honest, I'd rather have you. Just like this, but not in bed."</p> <p>He paused a moment. "Well, I can never be sure I'm a good lover. I've had one too many, but I've had a whole lot of guys, not just one or two. But I just don't see being with anyone quite as much as I would a good time. I mean, it's been a while. It's not like I have a good relationship. It's just sex."</p> <p>"You don't need to be into that. We've done this before and don't need to be talking about sex sometimes." With that she gave a sad little laugh. "Please don't answer that with love or happiness. I know what you're saying is true, but you have to know that, okay? I've talked about this with friends before. No, I didn't ask you if you felt that way."</p> <p>"No, I don't."</p> <p>"No, not even close to that. I don't feel exactly the same about being with anyone. Maybe I'm doing something with the wrong person. Is that what you're trying to tell me? That I'm not a right-wing that I can be sure of if I'm wrong? Is that how it is for every woman? You've got to understand, that's not for me either. I just... I don't have any right to judge you at all. I don't think I ought to be with anyone. I mean, I... I'm not going to do it."</p> <p>"Are you sure this is what you want? Isn't that what you've wanted all along? You want to be me?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>He was surprised by her words, but he wasn't sure that she was going to change her mind right now. He shook his head. "No."</p> <p>"Then it's alright. We both know that. You can trust me with this."</p> <p>"No, of course not, it's not what I really want. I can't even begin to think of being with anyone else."</p> <p>"It's okay. Don't get me wrong. I don't want to force you to do something you feel you have no choice to do you know. I understand and that's all that matters. I think it's all that I want.</p> <p>He couldn't bring himself to say any more, but he knew he had to. He took a deep, sad breath. She looked so good. It was like those stories of yours where you have no choice but to do what feels good, and when that is all that matters then just think it through and feel free to do it just the way you feel."</p> <p>"I don't know what to do now." She said softly. Her eyes were sad and she looked so small. He couldn't help but comfort her.</p> <p>"It's okay to be a little sad," he said and put his arms around her and pulled her close to his. He could tell that at that moment she was probably scared. He thought carefully about what they were getting dressed into tomorrow day, and all that they were going to talk about. All he could really feel was that she was safe with him. And then he was wondering whether he should keep his silence, and he decided to keep. He would get to ask that later though. Right now they both needed to get some sleep.</p> <p>They both laid on the bed, still looking forward to some sleep. He pulled the covers up until they were covering themselves, and he leaned slightly over her, put his lips softly against her own, and he heard her softly sighing.</p> <p>"You know if I ever did anything like that to you again... I'm sorry," he said as he stroked her cheek. He knew that this didn't go far enough. This had to be serious with both of them.</p> <p>"There are no promises. I don't know." And that's what she said to himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
