What did you think?"</p> <p>They made their way over to one of the pools; he sat down, watching the pool and it seemed as if it was going to go on for hours. His cock seemed to respond to his mind's attention when he thought about the women of the ship who worked in the same pools. It was something he had never done... he remembered... the one from the first time they met. She was there a couple of years after he had been born and he remembered the way she was looking back at him from the water. They exchanged pictures and she told him about what they had been doing... and she loved to be with him. He smiled and leaned to kiss her. She responded by kissing him back. Then as if the water hadn't already decided to take it's course she moved over and straddled his legs and leaned down and kissed him. They kissed again and he could taste himself on her tongue. It was sweet and so wonderful. His own tongue touched hers as she stroked him. She turned up and slowly put her arms around his neck and began to kiss him again. She slid her tongue into his mouth but only for an instant as she began to unbutton his shirt. He reached to undo them as his hands moved to her breasts and caressed them as they kissed him.</p> <p>Then all of the sudden she was gone... he was alone with himself... in the pool, naked with his cock rock hard. He lay there and looked at the wall... as if it were a ceiling mounted video camera on a tripod. His eyes began to scan the room as his mind kept getting on what was happening to him. He saw the women kissing and he felt the water as it bathed his body, his mind getting a little more focused. He took a deep breath and reached up and cupped her breasts in his hands. She moaned as he cupped them in his hands and moved them to squeeze them, he slid a hand down her body and found her wet pussy in his hand. She moaned again and his finger slid easily into her. He was in full control now. He pulled his finger out of her pussy and slid his finger into his mouth... sucking on his taste from it. He slid his finger back up to her clit and circled it as he rolled his fingers on her nipples... he moaned as he watched her pussy slowly being penetrated with his finger. He saw her pussy stretch around his finger until she felt herself being squeezed and heard her cry out... "Oh fuck, I am coming." He moved to his back and positioned himself on the bed between her legs. Moving her legs up he leaned over, licking her cunt as he entered her. When he was fully in she had a long and very wet orgasm... his breathing was coming faster now.</p> <p>He leaned forward and began to kiss her neck and face. She reached up and felt his throbbing cock as he placed it at the entrance to her pussy, the head of his cock was now rubbing her g-spot and she moaned loudly, "oh, fuck, that feels good."</p> <p>He moved slowly to give her a long slow in and out fuck... at first he moved only half into her and held the other side, "fuck me... harder..." She began to roll as his cock began to move more quickly back and forth. "oh... oh... oh... yes" she cried out... her tits were shaking all over as he slowly fucked her. They were the most erotic things they had ever done. Her nipples were hard and he sucked on them. He began to fuck her even faster and she was crying out to him all the while "more... more... more"... He began to fuck her even harder then before than he felt like he must have... he just wanted to watch her come and not stop. He reached up and began to rub her clit at the same time as they fucked. They both began to moan and she began to moan in earnest. She began to moan a little louder then "fuck, cumming... I'm... oh... so... gooooodddddddd." It was a moan of pure pleasure and a moment later she screamed out loud and she came again... "so big... soooooooo gooodddddddd... oh, yeeeeessssss." He couldn't hold on much longer, he drove her over the edge with his cock and he came deep in her. His orgasm was over... and they remained together for many minutes. She finally moved on his back, turned around and smiled at him "I've never cum that much" she said. He felt so good... it was the best thing they had ever done together...</p> <p>When they came back to normal, he had never felt anything close to what he just felt... he just kept thinking about the women... about the kisses and the water... "oh, I hope you are not mad, I feltâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
