I was greeted by a group of people, so I guessed I wasn't the only drunk there. As I got up a tall blond haired man took me through into the crowd, I followed quickly. She was standing close to me, and I reached my arm up to feel her breast, and to get a good squeeze of her rear. She stepped into me, and wrapped her arms around my neck. She grabbed a beer for me, and then started the conversation.</p> <p>"So how did that go?" She asked me over the loud music. "I hate to have to drive, but I had a really good night," she said with a smile. I looked her up and down, and asked, "Where are you from? You look great."</p> <p>"I'm from Boston, Boston, where could I possibly be?" We sat down at a table, and she ordered a large glass of wine "Well I can't talk now, but I have to catch a movie with a friend before we leave. Do you think you would like to join me?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm with you." The bartender was a little nervous, but he was more than happy to take us to dinner.</p> <p>We decided to order dinner, and then decide what to watch on television. After settling our tab, we went to the ladies room to freshen up, and then sat on the couch. Once finished with our drinks, he headed off to the restroom, so I took mine and a few condoms to the men's room. We returned to the game room, where there were more people in the sitting area, and began chatting again.</p> <p>After a few minutes, I decided to take a shot of tequila, and had an idea. Turning it over, I opened it up and poured the drink, then passed to her to go with it. I watched in anticipation as she began the shot, and took several shots with one hand. She was very relaxed, with only one hand in the air as she finished and downed the glass. I took a sip of the drink, and said, "Good Night."</p> <p>She walked over to the window, and looked out into the night sky "Good Night," was all she said, and then she turned and left the room, so I opened the wine, poured my usual shot, and followed.</p> <p>As we walked out of the room, I asked her, "So, where did you meet your husband before?"</p> <p>"It was a business trip, I had a boyfriend a year or two ago, or so we decided to try out the sex." She said sipping her drink as we made our way out of the dark hall of the hotel. As we walked into an older gentleman's bar, I thought "God he'll love a wife to screw," and then she turned and continued walking. I stopped beside her as she passed by, and placed my arm around her waist. "So, are you a doctor, or doctor's wife" I said in her ear.</p> <p>"We've been married for twelve years. I have been married for twenty five years now, at the age of twenty five." She looked over her shoulder smiling, "I'm sure you'll enjoy being treated well!"</p> <p>"Now, you know how to make it worth to you!" I said as we walked into this older gentleman's bar. He is only about six feet tall, and weighs about two hundred thirty pounds. He was wearing a dark suit with a bow tie. I didn't know he owned the bar, but I could guess on what he had in mind. The bartender was only to busy to notice. As we walked past he pulled up a chair and sat down in it.</p> <p>He looked in her direction, and said, "I would like to make an offer, to you, to you," as he leaned in and pressed his lips to hers, and I'm guessing the kiss was mutual.</p> <p>I was so focused on what was happening to her in the arms of a stranger that I almost missed her comment "We have been married for two years." I felt my cock harden a little as I looked at her and saw that she was only smiling.</p> <p>The young man looked at her directly and asked her if she would like for him to kiss her. She smiled at him, and said, "I'd love a kiss if you are allowed to do so." I knew she already had someone of his choosing tonight, and that he would probably kiss her the moment they were alone together. She had a small frame, barely holding 40 lbs, with no breasts, but large firm breasts and well shaped legs. I wanted to get between her legs and start to caress them, before giving herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
