I think you're really getting to me."</p> <p>"No, I can help you understand,"</p> <p>"Oh I'm sure,"</p> <p>"What about my job?"</p> <p>"I can help you get that off and move on to the real world. I haven't done any of the things you want to do, let alone talk about it. So I'm not really sure if I'm ready to get into the real business." He's a good salesman so he can understand how the world really goes on."</p> <p>"I'd like it just you and I can use my position to get on with life, then maybe I'll know if I should talk to the guys about coming. I thought they looked so scared when you met them."</p> <p>"I could show you how it's done, then tell them if I don't come along. I'll never be too bad."</p> <p>He was right. He'd been talking about it often but not recently. "You've got to get to know the guys. I need to get out of my shell before we can try to move it up. I've had enough of them and I'm not sure I can do that."</p> <p>She thought about asking to come with him, but she felt it was too risky for them to stay on their own. "It's just that I've been with more men than most of them, not to mention a lot of women."</p> <p>"So that's your problem."</p> <p>"If you're going to be in the business you have to work up the nerve to talk to a few of them."</p> <p>"I can't do that,"</p> <p>"Come on, you can do it,"</p> <p>"You'll have to tell me how to contact someone if you're going to do it."</p> <p>"What if my boss or her partner comes on to you?"</p> <p>"I'd be happy to let them know." She felt awkward about talking about that and she decided to push him. He was right; she didn't have to work for all of them. "I've got some friends at work who wouldn't mind the business and they're not the right kind of people to work with. You could tell them what to do if the work was needed, talk them into it, take credit from a number of guys who'd think they owed you a favour."</p> <p>He nodded his acceptance and she saw his face cloud over as he considered her offer. He was looking at her, his expression changing from the look of fear to desire. But even the look of desire told her that he was going to do it. She smiled, her fingers working the button a little tighter as she said, "If you really want, and you want to get with me, I'm all you'll have to do."</p> <p>"You're a smart girl, you really are. But I don't think I'm ready to do that."</p> <p>"I guess I just wanted you to make sure I was on my word," she grinned at him. "I could have told you to meet someone who needed to be seen. I don't even want to go into detail, just let the opportunity present itself."</p> <p>He nodded and said, "Okay, you're right. I have to get over the situation first and get more of these 'girls' interested in me."</p> <p>He watched her as she walked out with her friend in tow. She was wearing a long sleeved business blouse and a skirt that ended just a little above her knee, held together by strings that ended in a bow. It looked more like a loose fitting business suit and was a tight fit showing off her midriff. The skirt was split right down to the floor and it came down quite low. The skirt was almost all she wore on her head and it had a little collar at the back and was wrapped around her neck snugly. "You have my attention," he said to her and smiled at her. "What can I do to prove that I can do that?"</p> <p>She giggled, "I'm sure you can find a way," she said to him and kissed him. This time not too roughly, she worked him a little harder and they both enjoyed their kisses. They both found themselves getting a little turned on being with someone other than their husband. They didn't push anything too far. It was as if they were letting each other decide what was and wasn't enough.</p> <p>He'd come all this way to see if his company would pick him up instead of working for the big lug. "Okay, let's get it started, right here and now."</p> <p>They stopped on the street just a couple of stops and he looked at her. "You know, I don't think you would take me for a normal guy, right?"</p> <p>"Don't be so sure, but the jobâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
