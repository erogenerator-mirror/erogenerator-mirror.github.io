Part of me was hoping she'd call me right now instead of asking. Part of me was still concerned her reaction would be wrong and I did my best to be as calm as I could.</p> <p>"You mean it, you like me too?" she mused, her voice almost breaking. "I'm surprised... I mean no, this is wrong... and your face is so beautiful and you want to touch me like it's my body I'm touching."</p> <p>What kind of girl did she think I wanted to touch? I mean I am pretty tall, certainly taller than most girls I know, and she's not even twenty yet, but I just can't believe how long I've been staring at her. The woman was so beautiful I wanted to touch her. I want her to touch me. She said, looking down toward me.</p> <p>"Let's get out of there and I'll answer you..." her tone was flat and I was sure she was teasing me but at the same time I still wanted her to touch me, her face and her skin...</p> <p>We got to the car and I leaned over to her. Her face was only inches away, she'd given me the best kiss I've ever had so it didn't really seem too bad after I'd kissed her so passionately. I could imagine her lips on mine and the next thing I knew she was kissing me back, her tongue sliding between my lips as she wrapped my hand around her waist and started slowly grinding her hips into mine. When our kiss finally ended I pulled away from her but not as a result of the car but rather for the very first time ever. I could feel my heart pounding against my ribs as she looked into my eyes.</p> <p>"You're... not mad?" she asked as her hands moved up my neck and back, trailing her fingers over my face as her eyes closed.</p> <p>I shook my head and shook my head. "That wasn't nice, that was so wrong and... well to be honest I'm probably the most beautiful girl at the party."</p> <p>"Oh no..." she reached down to my pants, "this is the end of the relationship anyway. This is your fault, not mine. I should have said no and done whatever was required of me." She looked into my eyes with a bit of a devilish smile and gave me a long wet kiss as her hands pulled away.</p> <p>We got in the front seat of the car as her gaze continued to roam over my body. She gave a quick look at my pants where they were tightly stretched and then gave me a light nudge and looked me in the eyes. The sight brought a smile to my face and I felt my cock harden instantly. She leaned over and touched my cheek with her tongue and kissed my lips lightly before sliding her hand up into my lap.</p> <p>She looked into my eyes and gave me that seductive smile again before pulling away from the car. "Let's go get some clothes on...."</p> <p>As my girlfriend led the way outside to her flat there was an awkward silence for a moment as our heartbeats pounded against each other's chest. I was feeling the weight of her heavy breasts as if they were in my hands as we walked over to her place... and my heart was going out the door of the car.</p> <p>We got inside and she began laughing at me "Where do you want me to start my dress?</p> <p>She had always made love in her flat and this time was no different. She grabbed my hand and pulled me straight to the bedroom, her arms wrapped tight around me and her eyes dancing above mine.</p> <p>She began undressing in a flash and threw off her dress before stepping gracefully out of it as it started to fall from her body. I started unbuttoning my own pants as she stepped through the waist band to mine which fell to the floor as well. With one motion her hand came out and she rubbed my hard cock through my boxers, her lips kissing my chin. I kissed the lips of her flat stomach that seemed to glow in the dim light coming from the living room. Reaching down she grasped the waist of my boxers as my cock sprang to life and slapped up against her belly, making my cock throb in her hand as she gave a look of pleasure. She gave a knowing smile and began rubbing her hands over her titties as my hands ran up her legs to her thighs until they were just above her waist. We stood there looking at each other as she slowly started lifting her sweater up, exposing her lacy black bra underneath, her skin glistening in the light coming through the window. My own cock was throbbing wildly in her hand and I tried to hold back.</p> <p>"I should... I don't know what I would... do..." I started.</p> <p>"Do what you might doâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
