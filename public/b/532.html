He whispered in her ear as he kissed her there.</p> <p>"Oh yes."</p> <p>His hand slid up her body, over her bra and cupped her breast. Her nipple hardened at his touch.</p> <p>"Ooo...that's nice." She moaned. She felt his lips kiss her nipple. It was a tease, and it got her excited. She felt her nipples harden even more. "Oh..." He whispered. His tongue flicked at the nipple, making her gasp as a tingle shot up her body.</p> <p>"Oh, god!" She gasped as she arched her back. The tingles in her groin continued to build as his tongue danced on her nipple. He pulled her shirt over her head and threw it away. His fingers brushed her belly button, and she felt herself shiver. "Please."</p> <p>"Let me take your pants off." He said almost pleadingly as he slid them off. She didn't have a bra on under those. The only things he had on were his jeans.</p> <p>The light was blinding under the trees. She had a hard time thinking. Her hands caressed his neck. She shivered, and he shivered as she did. His eyes were closed and his head was thrown back. She shivered as his fingers lightly stroked her. "Take off your pants." he whispered.</p> <p>"Yes, please." She breathed. His fingers cupped her and she cried out as he slipped them inside her. His fingers curled inside her and gently stroked her. She jerked when she felt his finger slide inside her.</p> <p>"Are you all right?" He asked. His fingers slipped in and out of her.</p> <p>"You don't have to...oh...do that." She moaned as his finger slipped inside her.</p> <p>"Oh...don't stop." She moaned as he pushed in and fucked her. He slipped his finger out, and she moaned again. He had one hand under her and one around her waist. In that position, she had no choice but to open her legs. The tree branches rustled softly as he used every inch of his body. His fingers slid in and out of her, and she jerked as he filled her. The tingles he had left in her were gone. She felt like her body was on fire.</p> <p>He pushed her hands apart and her legs parted. He pushed himself into her, his breath coming in short, his lips kissed her earlobes and the small of her back. He moved his hips, thrusting himself all the way into her. Their eyes were locked together and the tingle returned. He pushed himself into her deeply, her back arched as they pushed into each other. "Oh...I...can't..." She moaned as he reached around and cupped her breast. "Oh."</p> <p>"No." He whispered against her skin. His tongue flicked at her neck.</p> <p>"Please. Please, oh god, don't stop."</p> <p>"Please, what?" He whispered as his hips began a slow, insistent rhythm.</p> <p>"Please...I want to."</p> <p>"No." That was all he said as he pressed his lips to hers. She moaned as her body moved against him. She felt his lips against hers and heard the sound of his teeth as they bit her. His hand found the back of her knee, and she leaned closer. His body pressed against hers. He felt her legs part and she moaned when he slid a finger into her. She wrapped her arms around his neck. His fingers went deeper as her walls tightened around him. She felt an electric shock. "Oh," she cried out as her pussy began to swell.</p> <p>He felt the heat as the waves rushed across him. His hand pushed into her again. The orgasm raced toward him as he pulled her against him and began to fill her with his seed. He pumped his cock into her, as his mouth found hers again. They cried into the night as their bodies came together.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>"Let's go." Jack said to herself as he walked into his office. It was his office and his mind took him past his desk. The sound of the door slamming filled the office. An image of the man who had just arrived came into his mind. He turned around and began to walk forward.</p> <p>"Yes." The voice said with a little smile. Jack turned around quickly and saw a very tall woman staring back at him. "Hi." She said while she leaned next to him on the chair. "It is nice to finally meet you." She spoke as she placed her hand on the side of his face. She rubbed her hand over his cheek and chin. Jack smiled as he stared into her eyes.</p> <p>She leaned in close as she whispered, "My name is Jackâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
