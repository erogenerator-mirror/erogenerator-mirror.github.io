You were still mad at me?" "You knew about my involvement in the war?"</p> <p>"I have an idea?" I said.</p> <p>"No! No, I never planned all this. I never realized..."</p> <p>"Just a little... I'm sorry"</p> <p>"Me too" she said, smiling. "Just a little, I wasn't planning on it happening here. I just... It makes me feel like family, like I'm alive. Please."</p> <p>She stood up and hugged me. "Thank you so much, honey."</p> <p>She gave my cheek a little kiss, then turned, walking up the stairs. I followed, following with my parents and brother.</p> <p>"Mom?" I broke the silence, walking up the stairs. "Do we have to talk about what happened?"</p> <p>"The whole thing is a lot of different than how it started, I guess." I gave her my hand.</p> <p>We walked hand in hand across the house, holding hands until we reached the bedroom.</p> <p>"What happened?" It wasn't an invitation.</p> <p>"You said that I'd take a walk in the park today. When I saw where the park was there, I went out to the other side. You know how people go." I pulled her into my arms, kissing her. "We went there, didn't we?" My hand made tiny circles on her right butt cheek, pulling her tightly against me.</p> <p>"No, we didn't," she whispered.</p> <p>I gave a little chuckle. "It was only a half hour of fun." I pulled her onto the bed, sliding my lips down to her ear. "Your mom and I are going to give you a call tomorrow and talk," I said, my fingers squeezing her breasts through her shirt.</p> <p>"That sounds good." She kissed my lips gently, slipping a hand up my shirt. She cupped my turgid member through my jeans. "Mmm, that's hot." She slipped the zipper down. "Didn't you come for mommy and daddy?" she asked after releasing me, my shaft.</p> <p>"Well, that wasn't as hot as what happened with me naked and with you two."</p> <p>She smiled and let go of my cock, pulling my shirt off over my head. My hands went to her breast, her nipples springing and rubbing against my palms. She moaned with the contact. "It's been a long time since I've felt mommy's tits." Her hand returned to massaging my cock. "I can't believe we'll never see you in the flesh."</p> <p>"Are you sure you aren't mad at me anymore?" I had to ask, to know.</p> <p>"No, honey, that was just a little exciting."</p> <p>"I hope it was fun, because I really want to see my mommy on her back again."</p> <p>"That sounds great." Her fingers increased their pace, feeling my throbbing member. She pulled away again, dragging her tits across my chest, pulling her shirt up over her head until they were both sitting on my lap.</p> <p>"Are your nipples hard now?" She pulled up and took my hands. "Feel them, honey." When she released them, I did the same.</p> <p>"You are so fucking sexy," I breathed, cupping each tit in my hands. Her fingers dug into my shoulders and pulled me tighter against her. She leaned back to kiss me again, her tongue sliding into my mouth. She kissed her way down my cheek and along my jaw, ending the kiss with a peck on the mouth.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I said.</p> <p>"I never said you were sorry!"</p> <p>We kissed for another few moments before she broke it. "I love to kiss." She sat up, pulling my shirt off and throwing it in the chair. "Let's get naked, okay?"</p> <p>I did so, standing up as she unbuttoned her jeans. I peeled them down and off of her legs.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm not nearly as sexy as you are," I said, kissing her neck. As I kissed her neck, I pushed her jeans down. "Let's just get comfortable."</p> <p>"I feel like I'm on a roller coaster," she smiled. My cock, already semi-erection, throbbed with excitement underneath her.</p> <p>I slid down her body to the side of the bed, my cock standing straight up. I kissed down her chest, stopping to suck on her nipple. She wrapped a hand around my head and pulled me up to her mouth, running her tongue around my teeth. As my tongue touched her, it slid deep into her mouthâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
