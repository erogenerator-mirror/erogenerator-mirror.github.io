That I was not sure about.</p> <p>Kathy: Okay, if you don't mind, I don't think I should, I feel so self-conscious.</p> <p>Beth: Don't worry, it looks okay. It's actually a small size.</p> <p>Kathy: It looks fine to me, I like small size.</p> <p>Kathy: Okay, I'll keep my panties on. But how do you feel, while you're sitting there, in the car?</p> <p>Beth: I'm not sure about that, but I do feel very good, it is kind of sexy in a strange way.</p> <p>Kathy: Okay, that's good. You have a nice touch. Maybe it should be touched more.</p> <p>Beth: Maybe, but you should be careful or you might cum too soon. Maybe too soon.</p> <p>Kathy: I think so.</p> <p>Kathy: Don't worry, it felt really nice. I can't imagine what it would feel like in a different position.</p> <p>Beth: I'm not sure you've even put your hand in my panties yet.</p> <p>Kathy: Don't worry, I just feel really self-conscious about it.</p> <p>Kathy continued to rub me while she was talking to me at the same time.</p> <p>Kathy: Okay, the thing is, you have to tell me what you feel.</p> <p>Beth: Okay.</p> <p>Beth: My body is totally relaxed, and I feel really relaxed.</p> <p>Beth: I don't know, I thought I was getting too warm.</p> <p>Beth: I hope you enjoyed it, it was really strange.</p> <p>Kathy: I sure did! I have no idea what went on. Does your girlfriend feel the same.</p> <p>Beth: Her boyfriend isn't going to be able to be a good man!</p> <p>Kathy: I'm happy for you, I don't know what to say.</p> <p>Beth: And you're okay with what I feel?</p> <p>Kathy: I really don't think that's possible. I'll try to be careful about what happens with you, okay?</p> <p>Kathy: Okay.</p> <p>When I finished massaging her, she continued to tell me about how she felt. When she saw the bulge in her panties, she asked, "Is it growing any bigger?"</p> <p>Kathy: Yes.</p> <p>Kathy: Can you feel some of the things the car made?</p> <p>Beth: How many fingers can there be?</p> <p>Kathy: I don't know, maybe two.</p> <p>Beth: Okay.</p> <p>Kathy: They feel bigger than anything I've ever felt, it feels very strange to me.</p> <p>Kathy: You know, sometimes I wonder if it is possible, and that it is normal.</p> <p>Beth: Would you still have a girlfriend if that happened?</p> <p>Beth: Yes, I think so.</p> <p>Kathy: I doubt it. Your body is so beautiful.</p> <p>Beth: I think we're both getting a lot closer to seeing that.</p> <p>Kathy: Okay, how is this for going to work?</p> <p>Kathy: I'm glad she wasn't wearing panties, so I can feel you ifâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
