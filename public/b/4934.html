She handed it back to me and said, "Do you like?"</p> <p>"It's beautiful," I responded. It was a large clear plastic bra, and it was not loose enough to fall forward. Not too loose, but enough to keep me out of it. I then heard a soft click from the back of the bag and knew she had removed the top.</p> <p>"Now, be a good boy and get dressed for me," she said softly. "The bra won't be enough, and your penis will be poking through, so I'll have to go to a lot of trouble to get it back to normal size."</p> <p>She walked over to a small door. Then, she walked to the end table where my clothes were. Taking me by the hand, she led me to the door and opened it. "Take a look in the mirror and then get dressed. I want you to put this on," she said, handing me her skirt. It was a skirt of blue nylon, and she had me buy it. She then told me to put on my jeans before I tried it on.</p> <p>The top was a plain white blouse, and was made of leather. At the bust, my tits were bare, and I heard her rummaging through my clothes, and then said, "Here, try this on first." She handed me my clothes, and as I put them on, took me by the hand and led me back to room. Her bedroom was huge with a beautiful king-size bed in the middle of the room. She removed my bra, and said, "I'll save these for later, when you're a little more comfortable." Then she walked into the bathroom and turned on the shower.</p> <p>I followed her into just the shower and said, "Wow, what a beautiful place."</p> <p>She replied, "This bathroom is not for the office. It's for your bedroom. Besides, it's more like a library. Why don't you sit on the bed and I'll get you a glass of wine."</p> <p>She brought me my wine and turned off the shower. She then gave me my bra and panties and said, "Put these on too. They're going to be easier to put on over this." She turned off the shower, and walked back out to her closet and put the nightie on. Her reflection was very sexy as she put it on. It almost looked like a sheer gown. The fabric was tight around my breasts and I could feel the cool cotton on my nipples. She then turned her attention to me.</p> <p>"Now, put both your legs together like I was doing, and come to my side to give me a kiss on the cheek and a hug."</p> <p>I did as she told me, leaning my head back against her shoulder. She then kissed it and said, "Now, lean over my shoulder and give me another hug. It's OK, you really need to feel comfortable."</p> <p>I turned my head to her shoulder and said, "This feels so much better." Then I bent over her shoulder and kissed her cheek again, and then kissed the top button of the dress over her cleavage. I felt the warmth of her body on mine, and felt the hardness of her nipples pressed against the fabric of her bra. As the kiss came to a conclusion, she stepped back and said, "Don't lose your balance, because I'm going to change for you."</p> <p>She walked to the dresser, and returned to me, and helped me put on the bottom of my bra. As I felt the weight of the thin fabric, I smiled at my reflection. I could almost picture a sexy woman in the middle of this wonderful place.</p> <p>She returned and took a chair, and sat down. I could smell my perfume and it made my skin tingle. She then got out a pair of panties that looked like plain silk. I wondered where that perfume came from. She then turned around, leaned her butt against the chair, and then took the panties and held them out to me. "Put them on."</p> <p>A little on the tight top, there were no panty lines in the back, but the slit, of the under part of the panties, was showing the sides of the panties. The dress fit well, but the straps were just a slight line. I sat there and wondered what to do. Then, she said, "Hurry up and put the top on if you don't want me to get naked. There's no place to hide the thing."</p> <p>I had to be quick, and I hurriedly put it on. When I turned around, she took my hands and helped me out of the skirt. She then helped me put my shoes on, and then stepped back to examine me. I noticed that the black bra was quite expensiveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
