She blushed, not in a bad way, but because she was blushing at the attention. "Is your name Sarah?"</p> <p>"Yes, it's just me."</p> <p>"I'm Emily. Do you like her?"</p> <p>"Of course I like her. And she looks a little familiar to me, but I'm sure that must be where you came from."</p> <p>"That's right, and you're one of our new models." This was all a little unexpected, and I wondered why it wasn't obvious. Maybe she had taken this as a job.</p> <p>"Thanks, but I'm Sarah." I glanced at her face as the words left my mouth. My eyes met hers.</p> <p>"That I do." She looked away. "I'm sorry. I thought I would be the subject of all this attention now. I wouldn't have said anything if you weren't there." Her voice was thin and her eyes looked sad.</p> <p>I couldn't take my eyes off of her. In the distance Sarah's body language took on the stern tone of an old professor. I felt it on my skin, a flush spreading over me in anticipation and longing. I closed my eyes again, wishing I could see her face when I spoke to her.</p> <p>Emily's gaze lifted back to my face, and I saw a look of concern and sorrow there.</p> <p>"Please don't worry. If this is what you want, then I accept. You don't need to be upset. I just wanted to say to you my name." Her face was as serious as always, so I guessed that she was as scared as I was. In spite of the feelings I was having, I couldn't bring myself to respond. She had been right in her assumptions, her assumptions about the man who had made her happy. It was going to be her turn to hurt me tonight, and she had seen it in the look on my face as it burned out her desire.</p> <p>"Thank you," I murmured. "Thank you."</p> <p>My stomach had begun to tremble. She smiled shyly at me and I felt the tears pooling at the corners of my eyes. I felt dizzy.</p> <p>Emily's demeanor changed. She went to her bag and picked something up, and then turned back to me. "This should be good," she said. "I've never worn any stockings so soft before in my life, but I just adore them." She tossed her bag back into its sheath, and then turned to me once more, reaching back to pull the corset out from behind the strap.</p> <p>I felt my face redden. "Oh," I answered, looking down her body at the corset on the floor in front of me. Sarah's outfit was different than mine, as was Emily's. It was a pretty dress, but something else, more intimate somehow. I couldn't help the feeling of disappointment that welled up within me once she had removed my dress all the way, but it quickly passed. Sarah was wearing a black corset, and a simple red bow at the top that had red flowers in it all. I had always felt self conscious about my breasts, but they hadn't been exposed until this evening, and it showed through as Sarah's breasts pushed up above the corset, causing it to move all the way to my midriff. The corset stopped at my knees, and, with its red bow still tied off, I hoped that Sarah seemed pleased at the sight of my breasts.</p> <p>Emily's face moved back to my body. "Do you like it?" She asked me. Her touch sent a shiver down my stomach. I couldn't do anything but nod my head. "I think I can make you feel comfortable wearing it for the rest of the day."</p> <p>"You're so kind," I smiled at her, feeling oddly proud of myself for letting her have this effect on me. As far as Sarah went, if I wanted to be anywhere else, it was my turn to look to be the model.</p> <p>"Thank you." The girl's face dropped lower. Her eyes widened. "Thank you for choosing me!" she hissed.</p> <p>She reached out a trembling hand, taking my own into hers. I could feel the strength there.</p> <p>I felt a bit overwhelmed by a force that I had never experienced before. I thought I was going to faint, but I let her lead me through the entire process. When I regained my composure I had the courage to speak.</p> <p>"I don't need the corset. I don't want to go out like this, in front of anybody else."</p> <p>Emily laughed. "You have no idea."</p> <p>"You'veâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
