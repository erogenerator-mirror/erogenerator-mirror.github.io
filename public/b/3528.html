A few minutes later, a tall, well built, young man came in, came over and introduced himself as Matt, Matt, Matt's Mom and they were all sitting on a couch. We continued talking.</p> <p>After a while, Matt asked, "Do you ever come here with Matt?"</p> <p>"Um, of course," I replied.</p> <p>"You've always wanted to see me," he said. He was looking at my crotch.</p> <p>"He's cute," I said.</p> <p>"Would you like to?" he asked.</p> <p>"I don't know," I admitted.</p> <p>"I'd love to have a chance to see you, too," he asked.</p> <p>"I'd love to, too." I wanted to get closer for a second. But I looked at Matt and he was smiling at me.</p> <p>"Sure, that is all right," I replied and got up. I took Matt's Mom to the other side of the room and sat down on his couch. Matt smiled at me.</p> <p>"Hey, um, Matt, uh, I can't come today."</p> <p>"Okay, um, sure, what time can we do it?"</p> <p>"What time is it?" I said.</p> <p>"In ten minutes."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"I'll wait until it's almost eleven, then."</p> <p>I gave him a kiss on the cheek and we got up. It's been way too long since I've been with a guy on a date, and my boy was nice and he was polite.</p> <p>I went to my room and changed into an outfit I could dress myself up in. It's a little black dress, not a little white one, but it looks nice on me.</p> <p>I put on a red silk button-down blouse that I was just wearing and a pair of blue and black pleated blue pleated panties. I put on a pair of blue high-heeled sandals and put on a long white pleated skirt and a white halter-neck top with a green bra that I also bought.</p> <p>While I was changing, I felt the breeze get to my skirt and I turned around to see if I could see a breeze. Sure enough, the breeze. It was a slight breeze, but the material was soft. I loved the way the material of the skirt felt against my skin and it rubbed against my back and made me feel sexy.</p> <p>I walked over to the window and opened the curtains and sat on my bed. I waited. After ten minutes, Matt stepped out of his room. He was carrying a piece of paper.</p> <p>I looked up at him, and he said; "Here are my messages."</p> <p>I took the paper and read it, I got up, and said, "Thanks, Matt."</p> <p>"Yeah, go ahead and sit down and make yourself comfortable."</p> <p>I sat down, opened my legs and he put the paper down. I took my shoes off. I put my feet on his lap and took his hand in mine. Our eyes were gazing. We looked at each other for a long time. He could see I was still a little embarrassed to be sitting there watching someone get into touch with him.</p> <p>He said, "I don't know if the girls' are expecting you here."</p> <p>I pulled up my skirt, unbuttoned my top, exposing my breasts, and said, "They certainly aren't."</p> <p>He took them in his hands and squeezed them, and I said, "I'm so horny."</p> <p>"I can see you are. Are you enjoying yourself?"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, I'm just nervous."</p> <p>"It looks like you're making yourself excited, too. Are you nervous?"</p> <p>"No, no. I like being myself."</p> <p>I closed my legs and said, "I'm nervous I'll say something."</p> <p>"Okay," he agreed, then he took my hand and put it on his crotch, which I could feel his erection getting. He pulled my hand out. "Would you like to see what the girls have been waiting for?"</p> <p>I pulled my hand back and looked at him and said. "I've never done anything like this. When I get excited, I'm like crazy."</p> <p>"Come to me, Matt," I said as I kissed his cheek. I reached down and started rubbing his hardon. It was straining against his pants.</p> <p>"Go ahead, if what you're doing feels very good."</p> <p>I pulled his zipper down and he helped me off myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
