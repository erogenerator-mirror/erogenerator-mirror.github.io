So why don't we go down to the garage to cool off?"</p> <p>"OK. I think we can get it all done without any problem."</p> <p>We got out of the tub, picked up our robes, and headed toward the door.</p> <p>"Are you all right?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes." I smiled and held his face between my hands and kissed him. I could taste his salt as his tongue probed my mouth.</p> <p>We got into the car and drove to our condo in total silence. It felt like a dream and I'm sure our entire family was aware of what we were doing.</p> <p>We drove about two hours before we got to our house. This was the first time we were out together in a car.</p> <p>We went into our room and I took his hand and we went to our room. I undressed him and got on my bed. He climbed on and I turned away from him before I sucked his prick. I licked the entire shaft of his dick before I slid it in my mouth. My tongue danced with his dick and he moaned.</p> <p>I felt like I was going to pass out. My knees were weak when I saw him. He crawled between my legs, lifted them, and pulled them back into his mouth and down his body. When he moved his dick under my pussy, he slid it in my pussy.</p> <p>"Oh!" I said. "I love having your dick inside me."</p> <p>I had always dreamed about having such a dick inside me. I knew what a good dick felt like, even though it was covered with dried semen. It was big and thick and very hard as he moved it in and out of my pussy.</p> <p>"It's so nice being inside you. It feels amazing," he said after it was completely inside me.</p> <p>"I want to be with you forever," I said. "This is something we really do."</p> <p>I felt him pump it in and out and he moaned.</p> <p>"Want me to come in your ear and tell you how much I love you?" I asked.</p> <p>"I love you too." He said and put his finger to my ear.</p> <p>"You're my lover for life," I said. "I want you inside me forever."</p> <p>To my dismay, I came almost instantly as I heard him say the words. I was in such a sexual and physical euphoric state I almost passed out. I felt his dick inside of me, pushing at me. I screamed. My body thrashed and convulsed. I came with a tremendous orgasm. I pushed myself right down and felt his dick go in deeper.</p> <p>"Oh my!" was the only thing I could say.</p> <p>When he stopped, his penis was almost out of me and he lay on his back. I pulled my legs to my chest and put them over his shoulders and his cock went back in me. My body was on fire, it felt so good and wonderful and this was so wrong.</p> <p>I was lost in sex, this taboo act. I was the first person I had ever been with and the only girl I have ever been with.</p> <p>"Oh, baby! Your beautiful cock feels so good! Oh, yes, oh, here it comes. Yes!" I said with pure joy.</p> <p>With each spasm I felt his cock go inside of me. It felt good inside me and soon we were both breathing hard. He held me tight and began to move his hips. Our bodies moved in rhythm together. His cock was buried deep inside of me as I had never felt.</p> <p>"Don't stop," I said. "Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!" I continued until we both came. I felt the big contractions inside me and then my body collapsed against his and he kissed me.</p> <p>My legs started to shake and I felt like I just came twice. My body was on fire with sexual bliss. It was the first time ever in my life I had cum from just intercourse. Even though every man and many women made love with me, it didn't happen all night and was a new experience. It didn't feel wrong, it felt right.</p> <p>After we had our breath back, he whispered in my ear.</p> <p>"I want a lot more of that."</p> <p>"Me too," I said and we both laughed.</p> <p>It was the first time I had ever imagined we were together. It was the first time I ever thought I would sleep with another man. It was the first time I had ever thought I would give a blowjob to a man, noâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
