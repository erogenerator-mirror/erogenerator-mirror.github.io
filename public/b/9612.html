It's just that you shouldn't have said that."</p> <p>"No, I'm sorry. It was just a bit of a shock and I can't go on about it now."</p> <p>"I know. What did you do to make you want to do that?"</p> <p>"What do you mean? I just wanted to do that to you."</p> <p>"Is that what you're saying?"</p> <p>"Well, it's okay if you don't want to do that. We'll just have to settle for whatever we can do."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>I left him speechless for a moment. I wasn't even sure if I should be angry. It had been a really strange evening but I was proud of myself for making him feel that way. He was a good guy, he didn't need to feel that way. He wasn't going to get any of the same from me. I walked away and went to work. I did a little digging to see if all this was true. That was interesting. But it seemed strange to say it out loud. I kept asking. He didn't deny it. He just refused to give in.</p> <p>It was only when Mr. Brown came out at night that I realized that I was in a little more trouble. I wasn't really in any danger. I knew that Mr. Brown thought he was making me do something, but he wasn't. He made a point of asking questions from time to time like, "did you do anything to make yourself cum?" When I'd answer him, he didn't have to try and explain himself. Even when he knew it wasn't possible, he simply told me to "do whatever you want." I had no reason to lie in confession, I was a married woman in my own bed.</p> <p>I told my dad that I was going to ask him something, but he said, "You can take any way that you want to. What's the problem?"</p> <p>But then he wasn't saying a thing for what seemed like an eternity. His attention was on nothing at all but me. That night I'd found it easier to tell him what he needed to hear. I just hoped that he hadn't found out about us because for me to tell him the truth was a lot easier. After all, that was just how he was in his own head. He needed to believe in me.</p> <p>The last thing my dad wanted to hear was, "you're a terrible liar."</p> <p>I took a deep breath, "and if I need to stop asking, I'll tell you. Please forgive me." It was the truth of the situation. The thing that I said to daddy didn't register for him. I guess that's why my dad was so interested that night when he told me to stop asking him how I felt.</p> <p>"Well, I don't think that you are very nice, but I think its best for you to be honest and not pretend you were the one who wanted to stop."</p> <p>He looked surprised at that compliment.</p> <p>"Daddy, I want to try to please you. I want to make you happy."</p> <p>"It's just not easy, sweetie. You just have to learn how to make your daddy happy."</p> <p>"I'm not supposed to be pleasing my daddy because he's my Daddy."</p> <p>"If you ever decide to tell me something, I'm not too upset. If you ever decide that you'll tell me, then I'll believe you. I mean, I'd like to keep this a secret."</p> <p>"Okay. Whatever you say."</p> <p>My dad didn't say much that night. He left at sunset on his bike to his parents' house in Connecticut. He drove away shortly after sunset.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. This sucks."</p> <p>"It was no problem." I'd heard enough that night. I'd made a decision to ask him.</p> <p>But I was never going to do it again. I'd just had to try to convince myself that I enjoyed my role as being his girl. If I was too harsh, I'd just quit. I knew that I didn't have long to wait. And I wasn't going to quit it again. That night, I thought more on it. I think I got over my fear about asking him to do whatever was best for me.</p> <p>"Would you like to see a movie with me now?" I asked my dad.</p> <p>"I think I'd like that, actually."</p> <p>"Good. What are you going to say?"</p> <p>"I can't really say that, because I don't want your mother to know that you're the one I love, but it was my mom that said something to me that nightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
