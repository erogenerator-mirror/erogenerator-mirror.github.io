I sighed, and she leaned over me and kissed me gently on the lips. "But don't cum yet, I want you to keep me wanting you."</p> <p>We kissed again. Her lips moved down my jaw, stopping a brief second each time her tongue snaked out to brush the tip. Her tongue darted out to tease and tickle, as her hands moved from my hips to my breasts, gently taking my nipples between her thumbs and forefingers as they hardened. Her fingers danced their magic on my breasts, and when she reached between my thighs to rub my clit while she fingered me, I groaned loudly.</p> <p>"Oh my God," she said quietly. "I really need that."</p> <p>"Me too," I said.</p> <p>Then she moved off of me, onto her knees behind me.</p> <p>"I can't get that thing away from me," she murmured. "You will always feel wonderful inside me."</p> <p>Then she took my panties from me and rolled them down my legs. We lay there on her bed together, our legs intertwined, her pussy against mine. I could feel her lips lightly brushing across my nipples as her kisses slowly moved down to the hollow of my legs. She kissed the tender skin of my thigh, then she softly nibbled my flesh, my skin, as her hand reached for my pussy.</p> <p>I knew I needed to be fucked, hard, desperately. She could see it in my eyes.</p> <p>"Oh God, Baby!" I moaned.</p> <p>"What?" she asked.</p> <p>"Your little nips are too sensitive, Baby. Put them away and let me feel you." I could hear her voice in my head as I realized she meant it. There was little doubt her pussy was as wet as mine.</p> <p>"You do have it, Baby, but, just not here."</p> <p>"But Baby, I am yours, and we will cum together."</p> <p>"I know, I can feel it, Baby, but not in the bedroom."</p> <p>I knew I didn't want to make love with her now, I wanted to kiss her there and feel what it was like to be her pussy. It wasn't easy, but I didn't want to force any feelings as my hands rubbed her inner thighs, feeling down her stomach to her breasts, where they pushed into my hands.</p> <p>"Not there, Baby," she said. "It's in the other room."</p> <p>But her words had the effect of turning on me, for she had moved her legs apart so I could feel her lips against my skin. She lifted up slightly, and put her hand on my hip to stop me, and her knees were spread wide. She looked back over her shoulder at me and smiled. "We don't have to put these on or anything," she said, and then turned back to the other room.</p> <p>I saw her hand reach into the nightstand drawer for the lube that I was supposed to have picked up there earlier.</p> <p>"Did you have this," she asked.</p> <p>I couldn't look at her, for the feelings I'd felt had drained from me. She was lying there in the dark, my hands rubbing my breasts, her mouth and lips, her pussy and ass. But, in spite of the feeling, a tingle ran through me when two sets of lips gently touched mine while she kissed me on the lips.</p> <p>"There's no reason for us to have to do this for your sake," she told me as she turned her head once more to look at me. "I wanted to tell you before we did anything but you got here. And I've wanted you for a very long time. You are special."</p> <p>"Thank you, you're always special." I was smiling for no particular reason now, and I'm sure the answer was obvious. But there was no doubt about it. Now that we were alone together, our bodies pressed together, my pussy and her body were wet. She was moving from side to side, and she made little noises as she rubbed my clit.</p> <p>"Come on," she said softly. "Fuck me with that big cock of yours."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I asked, surprised. "I don't want to hurt you."</p> <p>"Don't be afraid, I've been on the pill almost a month."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" she asked, and she made that noise again.</p> <p>"Yes," I replied and I began to move my hips to move mine down the bed.</p> <p>"Shit!" I exclaimed as her body pressed up to me. "Fuck me!" I shouted, as my pussy and her pussy moved together with me.</p> <p>I felt her lips slide back to tease my nipple as my hipsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
