He asked. He was so deep in thought, that I didn't think I could answer. I stared at him, thinking how easy it had been to seduce him into doing this. I'm not sure I wanted to, but I did at the same time. I just had to find out if it would be wrong. He turned his back to me and took a step back. He seemed more relaxed than anything we had just had. I wanted to touch him, to feel him. I wanted to feel him inside me, taking me, and making me his.</p> <p>The idea of wanting to have intercourse was so strong that I needed to know what it would be like. I looked into his eyes and I had to have him. I was trembling but I also found myself staring at him. I couldn't think clearly.</p> <p>'We should have this talk later, I have to find out what is happening, and what is about to happen,' I said softly.</p> <p>'Will you look at me, Sam?'</p> <p>I stared down into his eyes, wanting what I could see. I wanted to take him in my arms and hold and kiss and feel his body, feel him thrusting into me, and then, and just say, 'Oh, I want to fuck you, honey, fuck me hard', and I'd go on the freeway and take a shortcut home. The idea was both exhilarating and exciting in its own right. I couldn't wait much longer and I wanted him so much.</p> <p>We walked over to the picnic table and sat down, pulling his chair back to make room. He pulled some papers off his desk and began to write on it. He stared intently into space and seemed to think of every possible thing. I tried to think of other things as I felt so close to him, but I didn't think that I would actually have sex with him. We had our talk, that is, for hours, but there is something special about the talk when it was right before it was meant or inevitable. It was easy and easy to tell that I was really going to be there with him and all, but there was a very real possibility of some other event if we didn't go back and forth.</p> <p>After an hour or so he stopped, just stood and looked at me for a long moment. He looked at me for a second or so, then moved to kiss me on the cheek. It was a gentle kiss that he would try to pull off with his hands, but the passion in it made me go limp. He was a very beautiful boy, I thought and I couldn't help but respond to him. This was a real date and it felt so natural to be a little bit tender in that we hadn't ever done this before for me. And then he stepped back and I could see that he wanted very much to just kiss me for a long time.</p> <p>I stood up and we moved to the table to set our food in front of us. His hand gently took my chin in his as he looked deep into my eyes. He was right, I don't think I had ever been kissed by anyone like this. He kissed my lips gently before he sat across the table from me and then he leaned his head back, closed his eyes, and took a deep breath. He inhaled again and just sat there, staring at me as if he couldn't get enough.</p> <p>He didn't say anything for a moment. I didn't notice. I was absorbed in the moment and I didn't move either. He smiled and asked me, 'Have you ever been with a woman?'</p> <p>'No.' I said softly.</p> <p>He looked at me closely and leaned forward. 'Are you sure? Are you sure you want this?'</p> <p>'Yes, Sam, I am sure,' I responded.</p> <p>'I want this,' he said, softly and with a big grin.</p> <p>'Would you just do that for me?' I wanted to be sure.</p> <p>He looked at me with a funny expression on his face before he said, 'Will you at least kiss me.'</p> <p>I looked at him to see him thinking seriously. I decided it wouldn't hurt to try for one of those soft kiss in front of someone, especially someone of my own age. I leaned forward and kissed him. It was a soft, tender kiss and I felt my heart start to pound. I was about to kiss him for the very first time. As we kissed, I suddenly realized he really wanted to kiss me and it felt like he was about to ask me to do so. I turned my head and our lips parted and I could taste the faint traces of our earlier foreplay. I turned back to look at him slowly and said, 'Sam, I've never been kissed like this before.'</p> <p>He smiled and said, 'I think we both know whatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
