After a second or two, with her friend's consent, she opened the door and walked quickly through it to the sofa bed and sat down, spreading her arms apart and crossing the floor. She pulled her knees up and crossed them quickly to make sure her legs wouldn't be spread wide. She looked at the young man as he slowly sat back a bit. He looked at her and she felt nervous at that.</p> <p>"Don't move an inch," she said as she looked up into his eyes. "It's your own fault if you move."</p> <p>He seemed a bit surprised at the change, and perhaps even more so, when she made the movement. It made her feel both uncomfortable and excited. But at the same time, she couldn't deny the fact that she was curious to see what he looked like. She stood up quickly, feeling a bit of a surge of nervousness, and pulled up her short pleated skirt. Her hand slipped over the bulge in his trousers as she felt him hardening and she felt the blood surge to her own pussy as she imagined her tongue, lips and teeth on him.</p> <p>"We'll go slow and see if we can make us as horny as we are," she thought as he nodded and she felt her own body shiver as she stepped over the edge of the bed and over the edge of the door. She slid her panties down to the floor and stepped out of them to stand naked, wearing only the panties, on the sofa cushion. She turned onto her back and spread her legs, leaning her head back and enjoying the look of nervous excitement she saw as his eyes devoured her body. She felt the blood pounding in her pussy and a tingling in her nipples and through her body, making her nipples hard as she rubbed her own breasts, feeling the desire growing on her crotch.</p> <p>The young man moved around behind her and stood, his hands gently caressing the round globes of flesh. For a moment he squeezed them and then let go of them, as if they were toying with him. She let out a sigh and turned her head so he could continue squeezing as his hands moved all over her body. He slid his hands up the cheeks of her ass and down to just under her skirt to grab her bare ass. She felt his hands press on her upper back as he pulled her backwards, forcing her down toward the sofa bed. His hands moved quickly up to the hem of her slip and pulled it up and off, leaving it draping over her shoulders, back and upper arms.</p> <p>He took her hand and helped her up off the sofa, standing her with a large hand on each arm and their shoes right at the edge of the pile on the floor. He put his arms around her, hugging her to him. She pushed against him and felt the bulge in his pants begin to subside. "You're not just making it feel good, are you?" she asked quietly.</p> <p>"No, not for me," he replied and turned her over onto her back. "Now get on your hands and knees, and then crawl to the middle of the bed. And if I think you've done enough already, just do it again or I might have to do you up the ass again."</p> <p>"How do I do, do I?" she asked. It was the same question she had asked about how she had ended up with his cock hard and deep inside her pussy.</p> <p>He kissed the back of her neck, leaving traces of his tongue on her salty skin. He reached around her and grabbed her breasts, squeezing them and kneading the resilient softness of them. He began to lick the sides of her breasts, sucking each nipple and gently biting them. She let out the softest of sighs as he sucked her breasts and squeezed her tits, his tongue flicking the nipples gently in between his teeth. She let her legs open more and felt her pussy grow even wetter and hotter as he sucked and tongued each of her breasts. Her legs widened and moved apart, almost to her navel, but her hands pushed her knees back until they lay open, exposing her sex to his view.</p> <p>She felt his fingers run over her mound and stroke, lightly against the wet lips of her pussy lips. She felt the finger slip into the top and part them just like his tongue had done to her breasts so many times before. He looked at her, his eyes dark and dark against her smooth creamy skin, and watched as her finger entered her, pushing deeper into her pussy and moving in and out. He watched as her finger moved more quickly inside her and he saw her eyes rolling back as she nearedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
