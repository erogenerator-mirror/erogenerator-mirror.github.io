They had control. I had just fucked them. They could do what ever they wanted. We were all fucking. I looked at their faces and saw their expressions. Their eyes wide with disbelief, and my own shock that I had really done what I thought I was going to do. I felt it and I said it. I said, "I want you to do this every time." I leaned in and kissed their mouth.</p> <p>It was the most passionate kiss I'd had in ages. I'm sure they felt it too, because mine lasted longer. It felt strange having them kiss me like that. I started pulling on them and feeling them all pull on me and I lost control.</p> <p>When it came, I came. It was just as I'd promised it could get. They came. I was so excited.</p> <p>We had just made love. And we'd cum. The moment was over. We were lying by the side of the bed. We'd talked and fucked. There was no one better.</p> <p>We lay there, and my cock softening and my thoughts turned into a mixture of panic and arousal. I got up and found a Kleenex. I wiped it down and then took them out and got back into the shower.</p> <p>After we got out and dried off, I looked at them. They were staring back at me, both of them smiling. We had a laugh when our legs were dry. I picked up the little bottle that they'd left there. I looked at it, looked at them, then looked at my cock.</p> <p>"It's gone now. You two fucked each other today. That's what I do."</p> <p>"Yeah," they smiled back.</p> <p>"Well I think you're going to need it," I smirked.</p> <p>They got to their knees and took my cock in their hands. They held my cock and slowly ran it through their fingers, before running it over their lips. I sighed. I leaned against a stack of pillows so they could get better access. They leaned forward, looking at me.</p> <p>I looked down at their luscious faces and I said, "I loved this. I loved making you come."</p> <p>They were both smiling at me. "Come up here," I instructed. They jumped up and embraced and gave me a passionate kiss then I put them down in the bed.</p> <p>I turned out the light and walked naked to where they were, standing behind them and stroking my hard cock.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck me," I moaned. I leaned down and started licking them from their clits to the rim of their ass. They both moaned and writhed as I went and we kissed again.</p> <p>I moved between them and moved in front of them and pushed them up by their shoulders so they were almost on their faces. I looked at them and slowly slid down their throats, my head just barely touching their chests. I wanted them to suck me as much as I wanted them; my cock was throbbing hard and I didn't want them to stop. I sucked each of their nipples, kissed each breast and sucked and licked and tonged. I kissed their faces and licked my way from bottom to top.</p> <p>I looked up into their eyes and said, "I'm going to fuck you. I'm going to make you feel amazing again." I moved down towards their legs. As I got to their legs, they wrapped those sexy thighs around my head. I got up to where I could lick and suck their clits. I was ready to shoot.</p> <p>I went up and started to fuck their brains out. They moved each foot with my head on them and fucked my face in a mad frenzy as I sucked their clits. They both came with short orgasms and I just kept going.</p> <p>I kept going and fuck them, until they couldn't get off. I felt they were just getting off for me and kept going. By this time, they were all hard again. I looked down and they were sitting on the edge of their bed, holding each other lovingly as they panted and came and panted.</p> <p>As I stood up, I looked at them and they were both smiling. I walked up to their heads and started playing with them, stroking their heads and neck, moving from one to the other as they came again. Before they drifted off, I took them.</p> <p>"Oh, thank you," they said to me. I stood back up just a little and moved back between their legs, which were still wide open and I kissed and licked them from the bottom to the top. They kissed me back. I was hungry. And so were they.</p> <p>We kissed a long, lingering, passionate embrace before I got on top of them and fucked them. I took charge for once, which felt like a long time. I made love to themâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
