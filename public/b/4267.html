But it will be alright," she grinned, and nodded at the camera lens. She took the lens off and began looking through it.</p> <p>"So... um, you want me to take some pictures," she said, and reached under her desk to open some files.</p> <p>"Are you kidding me?" I laughed. "Look at this. We're not outed as a bunch of amateur pornos. You're getting your stuff and showing it to us!"</p> <p>"Well, I have an idea." She dropped the folders on the table and stood up. "I'll see you at 7.30 tonight."</p> <p>On the way back I looked over to Natalie's desk, which was now almost to the garage. "She's probably expecting your dad back for 3.00 tonight," I said to myself. I saw a look cross her eyes and a slight smile, but she was just looking at the folder. She really did have some talent.</p> <p>Natalie was going to be home all night? She certainly knew how to turn it the other way, even more that I was ever going to let her back to the office. That thought alone took me to another level, and my cock started to pulse.</p> <p>"Hey, come back tomorrow!" I said to the window at 7.00pm.</p> <p>I watched as my younger sister went upstairs to bed, leaving me to my work. I spent the next hour getting ready and packing, thinking about what was going to happen. I was on the bed in about 5 minutes before I heard Natalie come out from her room, dressed in her sexy nightgown, her breasts swaying softly under the thin material. A light blush covered me and I stood up, taking her in, and looked at her. My eyes roamed all over her body, stopping at her breasts, which were still very perky, pushing out the top of the thin cotton gown she was wearing. When I caught myself staring at her face, I knew that the way her lips curved when she smiled at me made my cock start to twitch.</p> <p>"Hi," I said.</p> <p>"Hi, Kevin," she said with a smile, giving me a kiss on the cheek. She quickly walked to the door.</p> <p>I took one last look at her, taking her hand and pulling her toward me, letting the hem of the gown fall, my eyes wandering from her eyes down to the tight black panties she was wearing. As my eyes locked with hers, my thoughts quickly moved from her breasts down past her legs. Her legs were long and smooth. They were covered with a silky black thigh-high stocking, which ended just above her knee. I noticed that she had one stocking on, and was carefully pulling the other one up.</p> <p>"Nice!" I said, kissing her on both sides as she stood up. I gently lowered her down onto the bed, her legs falling open as she pulled her nightie over her head. I moved forward and gently kissed her lips, as she continued to pull the negligee over her head.</p> <p>"Kathryn," Natalie began. "You know how I like to be able to make love to you?" My sister asked me as I slid down her body, my cock now touching her panty-covered pussy. "I'm a little worried that you'll be too comfortable with us naked."</p> <p>Before I could say anything, however, I noticed that Natalie was smiling, and I could feel heat in her body as she reached out to me, caressing me through my shorts. I quickly dropped my shorts to my underwear, releasing my throbbing cock for her. "You want me naked right now?" she asked me as she slowly stroked me, my cock throbbing within her hands.</p> <p>Without a word, I pulled her head to my, her soft lips opening willingly to let me have her mouth, kissing her deeply. I lifted her onto her back, my arms sliding up her legs, my hands sliding over her breasts, down to her waist, my fingers running through the soft brown hair. I knelt above her, kissing my way down her neck, stopping at her breasts, massaging them, caressing them, nibbling on her nipples, making her moan in appreciation. I lowered myself down to her, my mouth sliding over her flat stomach, my tongue licking along the crevice where her leg joined her body, licking the edges, nibbling on the flesh below her knees. I kissed the tops of her inner thighs, where her legs joined her body, pulling the skin away from the other. I heard her moan as I worked my way back up her body, my hands running down through her now-soft pubic hair. When my hands were at her groin, I felt her hands grasp my head as I pushed them into her groin, her legs wrapping around my waist as I moved higher, kissing her belly, slidingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
