She said with a smile.</p> <p></p> <p>'Thank you for that! You should be in a lot more trouble.'</p> <p>'Don't mention it, and I'm sure I can get away with it.'</p> <p>'Well, at least we'll have something to celebrate.' She joked.</p> <p>'What? Are we done.'</p> <p></p> <p>'Just don't do anything. I'm still a bit nervous about the whole thing, but I don't care. Besides, the whole thing sounds fantastic.' She replied, before she gave me a sweet smile and stepped towards me once more.</p> <p>'I can't make up my mind right now, but can you pick me up at lunch.'</p> <p></p> <p>'Okay. Let me just pack up my stuff. Then, I'm coming over to pick up my sister.' She smiled and nodded towards the house.</p> <p>We spent the rest of the afternoon together, in a state of bliss. Finally, I got tired of her flirting and started to leave.</p> <p>'I gotta get back to the kitchen. I just wanna freshen up a bit.' I said, as I walked towards the kitchen, wearing a rather light blue pair of shorts.</p> <p>We sat around, talking about everything, when I felt a hand brush its way under my t-shirt.</p> <p>'Mmmm! I like...that.' She said, as she wrapped her arms around me and pressed herself against me, which made me feel more and more comfortable with her.</p> <p>Just for a brief moment, I felt jealous towards her; I wanted to ask her how she felt about my girlfriend again to check my emotions. But I knew now, I was going to be a father. I also knew from her reactions that she was very attracted to me, so I decided to leave it up to her.</p> <p>With my thoughts still churning, I had decided to make a few decisions. That's when I saw a light at the gate and I quickly walked over to it. As I was walking over, I saw a young man wearing a uniform come into the garden.</p> <p>I heard him walk past me and I quickly went to see out his window. Once he was out of sight, I turned my head back towards her.</p> <p>'I'm sorry I'm late.'</p> <p>'It's no problem...I'm sure.'</p> <p>'It's okay. I couldn't wait. So, what do you want?'</p> <p>She slowly got up from her seat and came to stand in front of me and look me up and down. Her gaze came back into my eyes and spoke for me.</p> <p>'We should go now.'</p> <p>'No, not here. Let's go home.'</p> <p></p> <p>That night, I was having a little too much of his stuff, when she returned to the house and went in the kitchen, while I was packing my things. Once I was finished with my stuff, I went to my bed and lay there, for a little while, and then I heard the front door open.</p> <p>'Hey, honey,' she said, as she walked in through the hallway towards me.</p> <p>'Hey. I was just putting dad stuff away. I'll be out in a couple of minutes.'</p> <p>With a sad expression on her face, she put her hands against her head and looked at me.</p> <p>'What happened?'</p> <p>'Nothing. I've seen you there before, it's ok.'</p> <p>'No, it's not ok, what happened?' She smiled and shook her head.</p> <p>'No. It's okay. I'm sorry.'</p> <p>'That's ok. Now, I was just gonna go get us some Chinese food.'</p> <p>'Yeah?'</p> <p>'Sure. Why don't you follow me?'</p> <p>'I really want to tell you. I know you don't understand, but maybe we should go?'</p> <p>She pulled me into her body and kissed me. Not on the tip of my tongue, but on the lips, just with a long and slow motion. It was a beautiful moment.</p> <p>After we kissed and I turned to go to leave the house, she suddenly grabbed my wrist and moved up towards me and locked lips. I almost couldn't breathe because of excitement and then she gave a kiss that felt like electricity.</p> <p>I was speechless. I had never had a woman treat me like this before; and it felt like a dream come true.</p> <p>After a long and hot kiss, she pulled back and I was in a daze. Then a smile spread over her face.</p> <p>'How did it go?' I said, as I looked up at her.</p> <p>'I don't think it went too well. I've been doing it for a longâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
