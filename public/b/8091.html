They are going to get pissed. And I don't want to do that, but I don't have a choice. Are you a virgin?"</p> <p>"No, I'm not a virgin. But I don't have your number. It's just...well...I'm not a virgin." She had already removed the ring from her left hand and was pulling out another one with her right. I watched her face closely, the expression on her face told it all.</p> <p>"I see, my first. I think that's pretty hard to believe. But I'll be honest now. You're the first guy to have asked me to marry you...to be honest, you had your whole life to think about. There was no way that I was going to refuse this."</p> <p>"Yes, but it was almost like...like it was already done. So, no, I don't say no, I said yes. I really want to, and this is about time I did the old-fashioned thing."</p> <p>"Well, maybe that's what happened after we got married. It probably wasn't, but we still had that thing we had going." I took a couple steps closer. "I know you've been with girls, but have, haven't you gotten them? You've been with boys?"</p> <p>"I guess you could say that," she said with a shrug, "if it means I don't have to."</p> <p>"No, it's not that at all, and...um...I've probably had my share of girls." I had her in my arms as I kissed her on the lips, my tongue teasingly probing hers. At last I pulled back and looked deeply into her sparkling eyes. "So, I guess...maybe it's time we got married."</p> <p>"Yes, of course, please." I felt her hand reach out and grasp the back of my thighs, spreading them and then sliding between them to the point where it felt as if there was an elastic band on my crotch. She could feel the heat of my cock through the fabric of my suit. I could feel it throbbing slightly and knew that if I pulled back slightly it would make a bulge. Our hands came together as I started to unbutton her blouse, exposing the pink lace bra she was wearing underneath. It popped into my mind how long it had been since I had felt her breasts this way but knew that, in real life, they were perfectly sized, just slightly bigger than average. The two cups were of the right shape--not too saggy or too small--and just enough room to pull her breasts up to my mouth where my tongue immediately dived to lick and nip at the nipple--hard.</p> <p>That didn't last, for while my tongue had been playing with her nipple I had lowered my head and had just pushed her bra down so that I could suck it fully into my mouth. I was going to take a chance and lift her tit up to my mouth, but for some reason she stopped me. Then I felt the nipple harden against my lips, my tongue going to work on it. When I started suckling she leaned back against the sofa, her breasts rising with her breathing, and her hands holding my head in place before she finally pushed me away.</p> <p>I looked down and saw that the fabric of her top was pulled tight across the flesh of her belly button. Her skirt had ridden up to mid-thigh and was barely covering her sex as it hung from her hips so slowly that it would have been impossible for either of us to move in time with the movement of her body. I could tell that she was still wearing her high heels, but not too long and certainly not as tight as she was standing with her blouse pulled wide. I stood up, still holding her so that her breasts were hanging down completely out the front of her bra. I slipped one hand into the waistband of her skirt and, in a single motion unfasten then remove the skirt from her hips, leaving her completely naked save for the thin lace Garter belt and stilettos on her feet. She turned and looked at me.</p> <p>"Oh God, John...I can't believe this." She started to unbutton her blouse, her fingers fumblingly doing their work. "It's...it's...it's impossible. It can't. It just can't." She raised her hands to hold on to the sides of her blouse and began to tug at the belt, almost tugging it off and throwing it across the room while she spoke.</p> <p>"No, not with me." I put one hand on top of her right leg and gave her thigh just an inch or two before lowering my head. Then I started licking. The first few licks were long andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
