I joked.</p> <p>"And he might never come back to him. Now, what are you up to?" She asked.</p> <p>"Well, I was just about to change. Why don't you join me in the shower, and I'll help you change. You're the one who has to get ready!"</p> <p>"How did you know my name? You couldn't tell me who my brother is in the room with me. Why don't we make it quick!" And so I led her out of the shower, to my room. She looked into my eyes and smiled.</p> <p>"Okay, I'm back to me. What do you say to a nice shower!"</p> <p>So we both got out of the shower, and got ready, for our first meeting. After drying off, we quickly got dressed and left to meet the men in the car. When we got to the restaurant, we sat through a long dinner, getting familiar with the details of who we were. They were glad we were there to meet the members.</p> <p>Since it was a one person meeting, most of the men would be waiting over in the lobby, at least for a small table for two. This way, the men would be able to see who was who, and they could have a couple conversations together, before the meetings ended.</p> <p>During the hour to end of the meal, people were getting to know each other. I felt pretty good to have gotten to know her, and when she was not eating, talking, she was watching me. She turned to me as we got up to leave.</p> <p>"Did you enjoy what you've been hearing? Your wife is hot! Aren't you?" She asked.</p> <p>"Sure, she is. I've told you a bunch of stuff that we've heard before. She has a way with words, and is always very respectful. What you don't get with her, is what every one of you are thinking, when you talk to her, or try to talk to her. She makes me think, in a minute, that some time, we'll be talking in private, and we'll be having a lot more sex! We'll be having a lot more sex than most couples are having at each other's throats. And, because you can't talk to her about all that, it doesn't affect you in any way. I'll tell you what, how about a nice dance to celebrate your marriage?"</p> <p>After we ordered drinks, my wife asked if I would dance with her. "You know, I haven't had a good dance in a long time."</p> <p>"I know, baby. Maybe someplace private. But, it's time to leave. I want to tell you about us."</p> <p>She took my hand, and led me to the dancefloor. As soon as we got in the music, our hands caressed each other. She kissed me deeply, and then held me by the shoulders, as we danced, with the lights turned way down low. We could see the other couples dancing together, and then in between.</p> <p>I kept watching and feeling the guys get closer to us. Even though it had been a while, it also felt good to be with her again. As I felt her body, I knew I wanted us to fuck, every night. I had to see that, to make sure she felt as comfortable as she felt.</p> <p>When we got out of the club, after we were inside, she said, "I'm really sorry about all the way I was acting. I guess we have to go home now."</p> <p>"You're right. And it's so good to hear. But, when I saw you dancing with a real man, I knew it was really good to see you in someone with a man."</p> <p>"Well, I guess we could go back to the room. What do you say?" She asked again.</p> <p>"I don't know if I would mind waiting outside for a long one." It was too late, though, to turn back now. I didn't have any idea where to take her into the room.</p> <p>We entered the room, where the door was closed. I took her in my arms, and we started to kiss passionately. Our hands were all over each other, touching the others, feeling. Then, she pulled me down on the bed, and started sucking my cock. As I was sucking her tits, she came in my mouth. We stayed in that position for a while, until I could stand it no more. Then, I slid lower, and got on top her. She was so hot, wet, willing, and slippery at the same time. It was almost as if she had never felt anything like it before. She was almost moaning, as Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
