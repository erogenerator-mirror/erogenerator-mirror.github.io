I asked him.</p> <p>"It's a miracle that we can fit in here now. It's only for a couple of minutes, if we get out."</p> <p>"No..." I started to say as I saw a small hole appear in the ground and a couple of more people stepped out for a few seconds. All of them wearing light blue dress shirts and black shorts. The group of men I noticed all wearing loose sweaters on their shirts and loose jeans on a tight vest. They stood in the hole, I felt safe on that level. I couldn't see my hands so could say no or no to a couple of the women and the men in the group of men.</p> <p>As soon as they were away I began to make my way outside, trying to look more like a child. I tried to keep my mind on the task at hand while I walked the narrow streets, avoiding the prying eyes of any approaching police. Finally I reached the entrance of a neighborhood of businesses on the way to the school. I went in alone, knowing the place was deserted. I made my way to the first door on the right and knocked on it, trying to get something inside. I took out my wallet and a note on the door.</p> <p>"Please unlock it, please!" The note said.</p> <p>I put the key in the door and opened the door with great haste. Inside were four tall buildings with a white brick wall. I stepped inside and saw a single table on one. The table was white, with a round window on top in the far corner. There were three chairs on either side of it. One was white, a black one. The last seat was a white wooden couch with the bottom lying on the floor.</p> <p>"Take a seat," one well built black man told me. I took a seat on the couch. "Sit." he told me. I looked at the chairs and saw two black men sitting across the white one, one on each side and sitting opposite my left side.</p> <p>"What can I say? Pretty nice place." I said admiring the view.</p> <p>"Thank you, I guess it looks nice from what you told me in your office. Have you seen the office?"</p> <p>"No. Only one left." I said as they both turned to look at me.</p> <p>"Are the windows shut?" They asked.</p> <p>"No...but I can get the doors open if I get dirty." I replied.</p> <p>"Good guess."</p> <p>The men on either side of me turned and went back to their place. It seemed to me that I was never the same man again as this place had become. I had come to the conclusion that something was different about everyone in the world. I looked at the wall around the windows, only one wall facing the street. I saw a pair of large black hands, a small black woman, and two black men. The woman, a black man was on one side and the black man a white man. They stood around me like a crowd waiting to see who they would take in to the boardroom.</p> <p>The man on the wall began to remove the top button of his shirt revealing his large chest. I watched as his shirt was ripped from his body revealing a chest built for dancing. A few years I had been told that my body was a strong muscular man. This man had no such thing. He ran his hands over his chest in a slow and deliberate manner before he slowly undid the button on his shirt. The shirt came off and revealed his muscular body.</p> <p>The black man moved to my left and I could tell from the way he was moving he was very skilled in the art of seduction. He ran his hand under my sweater, down my side, under my bra, then under and onto my leg, cupping my leg with his right hand. His hand moved to my hip and he pulled me towards his body, taking a deep breath as the feeling of his touch washed over me. When we were close to each other my eyes closed. One of my hands rested on his shoulder.</p> <p>Another black man came forward and took my sweater off revealing a white shirt underneath to match his short hair style. He took my hand and placed it behind his back, moving my hand to behind his back and pulled my body closer to him, pulling my other hand behind him on the back of his right arm.</p> <p>The other black man took my bra off revealing a thin bra that made me almost stand naked in front of him.</p> <p>"Take this top off of me if you don't want to lose it." He said to me as if I needed to say anything more.</p> <p>I quickly stripped the bra off the man's shirt and threw it to the side and unbuttoned the buttons of his shirt. The man was not wearing a shirt; he unbuttoned his shirt and let it fallâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
