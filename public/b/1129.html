My friend Amy took me to the lingerie store, she was about the same size as I was, 5'3, about 130lbs. she bought some lacy French knickers and a matching bra as she went, I could see her nipples through her blouse.</p> <p>We went in the store and she had me get her some bras. I took hold of the cups, the first thing I tried to do was put my hand around the small of her back, but she held my hand away from the soft material, and asked, "Where's the other one?" I knew what that meant, "Put it on."</p> <p>Taking the bra, she led me into the dressing room. She put the bra on first; I stepped in, and she was ready to go. As she held the bra in place, she turned round to face me, and told me to put it on; she had me stand in front of her, and again put the bra on.</p> <p>We were soon in the lingerie section, she came to the head of the rack, and put her arm round me, and said, "Thank you for buying me."</p> <p>Sitting on her knees, she said to me, "I know we haven't seen each other yet, but you won't regret it, will you?" Without looking up, she put her arms around me, and pulled me to her, with one leg between mine and pressed into my pelvis.</p> <p>I was feeling a little uncomfortable, so taking my hand from her back, I took mine from the rear of the rack and stood behind her. Her leg was still between mine, and she pulled my hand onto the back of her thigh, pushing her pussy into me.</p> <p>"You can do this," she said, "And I know someone out there who might think I'm wearing a thong."</p> <p>I held her body tightly against mine, and we just stood there for several minutes; she leaned forward, her face close to mine, and said to me, "I'll try to find out as much as I can about this."</p> <p>She kissed me, pushing her tongue into my mouth, I could taste the sweat and excitement, but I didn't let her go.</p> <p>"This lingerie is not for women under forty."</p> <p>I replied, "I don't care, I like it." I took her hand, and slid it round the back of mine, and held it to my groin. We just stood there kissing and feeling our bodies pressing against each other. We were both breathing hard; she could feel my erection pressing against her thigh, and felt her hand slide around mine where it was. She could tell how excited I was.</p> <p>"Can I buy you something," she said, "You look good in it."</p> <p>She leaned forward, and let me pull her top up, leaving her breasts out, and she looked at me, then said, "That's not all I need, will you make love to me," and she took my hand and led my to her nipples. She put my hands on them, and said, "This is for me. Put your penis in now, and make love to me."</p> <p>She was so excited, I didn't get to finish my offer, when she kissed me. I pushed my tongue into her mouth, and we moved apart. She held me so the back of my head was against her breasts, then turned around, and knelt on the floor between my legs. She pulled me over to the bed, and we continued kissing while she pulled my underwear out of my pants, and pulled my cock out of my pants.</p> <p>She knelt on the bed, and as I lay on my side facing her, she undid her bra, lifted my shirt out of my trousers, and I was naked. I lay back on the bed, and she began kissing my chest, and belly, as she had done to herself, until her mouth was touching me as lightly as I could feel her fingers as they stroked my cock.</p> <p>She moved her mouth over me, as I could feel her fingers working the head of my penis; she licked my balls, and then sucked me in one at a time. I was getting close, but she didn't take me in her mouth, so she just held my body down while her tongue explored me. She knew exactly how to push me towards orgasm for me without really going all the way down.</p> <p>Her hand left my cock, and she pushed me down on to the bed. She pulled her panties down, and I saw her pussy, with a clear wetness, as she got turned on at the sight of me. I couldn't see much, but then I felt her legsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
