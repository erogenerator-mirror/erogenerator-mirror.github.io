Her body was slender, almost as slender as my own and the muscles of her thighs and calves were large, thick, and muscular. From her face, she was a striking young woman, with small-breasted breasts at most and slightly sloped hips, but a wide belly and a thick forest of dark curls.</p> <p>Her smile was almost motherly, and she sat with her legs wide apart revealing both her vulva and her clit. With a finger, she began to stroke her pussy lips, then closed her eyes and groaned. Her other hand went between her legs and began to caress her vagina as she stroked her breast. I noticed some drops of clear liquid sliding down her hand.</p> <p>"Did you like that?" I asked her.</p> <p>She nodded. She reached out for me and slid me down onto the ground, pressing me down onto my back. The woman was still stroking her cunt. The juice flowed out and dangled on her fingers. She pushed up with her middle two fingers, pushing them into her pussy, twisting them as she began to orgasm. I knew I wouldn't be able to hold out any longer, but what power was I to hold back.</p> <p>The woman looked at me over her shoulder, her body shivering. "Do it, do it, fuck me!"</p> <p>I reached forward with both hands, grabbed her hips and sank myself into the wetness of the woman's sex. I pushed out as I began to pull myself out and push back into her until I was pounding the woman. Her body began to shake more and I felt my own climax building in my groin. I knew that I wouldn't last long.</p> <p>The woman cried out and began to spasm, then began to convulse and buck against me. I felt a gush of warmth flowing out from within her and filling my balls. She screamed, "Yeeeeees! Yeessss! Yeeeeess!" and fell on me. I felt her come, too. Her inner muscles squeezed my cock so hard it felt like a hot glove around my manhood. "Fuck! Oh God!" she cried out when she felt me come to rest between her legs. "Oh yes!" she cried out again. "Oh yes, yes! More! More! Oh God!"</p> <p>The woman turned away from me, then turned back and leaned to kiss me, her tongue sliding into my mouth.</p> <p>"You better go," she said. "I'll come home soon."</p> <p>I raised myself up from the chair and stood up. I took her hand and she got out of the chair, stood and walked to the door. She opened it and went out. I looked toward my car, and suddenly felt as stupid as I expected. I looked at the woman again, then back at my car.</p> <p>Then I saw the woman's face, smiling ear to ear. "I like the sound of that!" she said. I started to open my door, then stopped. She hadn't heard me. I looked at her again. "You do?" she asked. I raised my eyes to meet hers.</p> <p>"I do," I said. As I opened the door, she reached out and took my hand again.</p> <p>"I came home and found a new woman, a new boyfriend," she said. "This is my friend Sandy," she added, pointing at me.</p> <p>"Oh," I said. "That's nice." For some reason, I didn't look at them. I walked toward the car, but she caught my arm and stopped me from entering. I felt dizzy and felt as if I might faint.</p> <p>I got in the car and we headed back down the street toward our home. It took about 15 seconds to get from Sandy's house to hers, then we drove to our apartment.</p> <p>"Are you sure you don't want to leave?" I asked her after I got in and I closed the door. We shared an embrace.</p> <p>"I'm sure," she said softly. "I've had a busy week." She ran her hand down my cheek affectionately.</p> <p>"I enjoyed it," I agreed. "We're getting to the part of our new relationship that's almost over."</p> <p>"But you still haven't done it," I said. I kissed her. "You know I'm going to leave you alone tonight."</p> <p>"I would," she said. "After Sandy goes off to college she'll be back for me." I looked at her. "So that's what you'll be doing?"</p> <p>"I'm going to be teaching in Chicago."</p> <p>"Oh." She looked at me. "Well, your time would be more convenient than ours," she added, raising a hand to her own lips.</p> <p>"Oh," I said.
