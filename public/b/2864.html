I spat back. "I'm sure I better leave you right now."</p> <p>I quickly stepped into the bedroom, throwing the door open.</p> <p>"Now what was that?" she cried. "You never told me he was your roommate!" Still standing there, I began to unbutton my shirt, as she continued to stare at my naked body. "You should go and tell the cops..." I said.</p> <p>"And where are you going now?" she asked.</p> <p>"I'm going out to the park..." I answered. "I'm going back to the campus to pick up some tennis equipment."</p> <p>She stared at me for a moment. It felt weird, her staring at me like that. "Oh fuck... I guess she'll just have to wait," she thought as she pulled up her shorts, showing me her dark trimmed pubic hair and her perfect tanned skin.</p> <p>"I just think we should go back to the campus. I can go home, I guess," I said and walked out of the house with her.</p> <p>*</p> <p>"You better call a realtor on you back," a voice said to me as I stood next to the door, looking in to see the man who had answered the door a day before. "I'll take that as a no," I thought to myself as the man went on with his conversation.</p> <p>I returned to campus and was on my third drink, hoping that the alcohol would put some spark in my life, and not the last. I turned to see my wife, who had her back to me and was trying to sit up for me. "Fuck you," she said to me. "You better come in."</p> <p>"You look so fucking hot, my cock will want to do that thing again so soon." I said to her as I grabbed my belt and turned. "Come on," I said and we got out of my car.</p> <p>"Thanks," she said as she looked over her shoulder at me. "Get in the park," she demanded just like she had done the day before. "I'm cold!"</p> <p>"Is that an invitation?" I thought to myself as I stood in front of her, then reached inside my pants to grab my cock. "Fuck, she stills wants that cock!" I thought to myself as I pulled out a condom and a tube of lube. I turned on a light and she sat in a nearby chair facing me. I took the condom off, then dropped to my knees, kneeling in front of her.</p> <p>"Oh fuck!," she cried out, as she wrapped her fingers around my erection and began to stroke it. "Put it in me, put it in me!" She cried out as I began to penetrate her with the head of my cock. "Fuck me!" she cried out as I began to thrust into her. "Fuck me! Fuck me harder!"</p> <p>I pushed into her with long deep strokes, feeling my balls slapping against her ass.</p> <p>"Yes! Oh yes!" she yelled and she squeezed my cock with her inner muscles as I reached under her and began to rub her clit, bringing her to the edge of orgasm.</p> <p>I couldn't hold out much longer, as I kept on pounding her pussy, feeling the heat as my hot sperm filled her and the tightness of her orgasm. I was feeling my own cock explode and it just sent me over the edge. "Ohhhh shit, here it comes!" I heard her yell as I pulled deep as I pumped my sperm into her. She was still shaking and moaning as I kissed her neck, shoulders and her nipples. It felt so good she finally released and began to fall asleep. I took the condom off and then lay back on the chair exhausted.</p> <p>This woman was amazing, and at that moment I didn't think I was in the position to be with any woman, so I didn't get hard again. As I sat on a side chair recovering from my latest ejaculation, I felt a hand gently rub my crotch.</p> <p>"Hey, where have I found you?" a voice asked. "Oh!" I moaned at the touch.</p> <p>"I was thinking we might go out on the campus. I'm not that crazy!" She said as she gently tugged my pants down.</p> <p>"Fuck, you look so fucking hot," I said. "You know, you wouldn't have been lying if you said that I was all over you. You are the hottest babe on the block!"</p> <p>"Why are you not staring at me?" she asked, stroking my cock through my pants. I looked to see the young woman from the night before. I had not seen her face before! I quickly turned away and began to pull the blanket off her blouse.</p> <p>"I wasn't staring," the girl said. â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
