We kissed deeply and I ran my hand up and down Beth's back and under her arm to her breasts. I pulled her panties down and off to the floor. She lay on her back next to me. I had her legs spread wide open and she pulled my hand against her wet pussy. I was amazed at how erotic she felt.</p> <p>I took my cock in as far as I could and slowly moved it back and forth across her pussy as I had been doing it before. It seemed like forever until I finally could get it all the way into Beth, I grabbed her breasts and felt how hard her nipples were.</p> <p>I had to be in her all the way, I didn't know if I should move, pull out or just keep going. She pulled me closer. I knew I wanted to take off her shirt and to make love with her so I didn't worry about losing my shorts. She said, "That feels so good, but I want you to last a little longer, so we can do it more when we get home."</p> <p>I pulled her up and on to me again. She said, "This feels so good. Don't come in me before we kiss and make love. We'll save that for laterâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
