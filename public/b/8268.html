In fact, I could come over for dinner if you like," she said in a sexy voice.</p> <p>"That would be great. I'd love to go out with you at dinner," I replied. "Why don't we meet for coffee at eight this evening? That's not too far away. That would be fun."</p> <p>"Sounds good. Let me call you later so you can tell me all about yourself and what you do. We'll talk during coffee, then."</p> <p>I agreed and I left the office to go upstairs and put on some clothes. I decided to have a shower, grab a change of clothes, and then dress up for the evening. I also put my favorite lingerie under my dress. It was not a size too small, but I preferred to have it on with the dress, so I kept it in my purse.</p> <p>A few minutes after I finished showering I got my key and knocked on the door. "Please open the door and come in," I told her.</p> <p>She opened the door and she was wearing a tight black dress that barely covered her ass. It was low cut low that highlighted her cleavage wonderfully.</p> <p>"Wow," she said to herself as she stared at the front of it. "I'm sure I look great in black."</p> <p>"Do you mind if I try on a few things?</p> <p>"Sure, give me a minute," she said, "and I'll get you a drink in the kitchen."</p> <p>I entered the kitchen, but could see her watching me out of the corner of her eye. That sexy view made me even more turned on.</p> <p>I went into the kitchen and she came in with the drinks. I was impressed by the outfit. She didn't wear a bra, but kept her nipples fully exposed. It was low enough that if she was sitting the bottoms of her breasts would be fully showing to me, but not low enough to see too much. I would have a hard time believing there were no tan lines showing over her bikini tops. She did have a gorgeous figure, but I thought it would turn heads.</p> <p>We had a couple of glasses of wine and then I suggested we go to her surprise.</p> <p>"You really should come in, it's a surprise and you'll enjoy it," she said as she stood up and led me to the bedroom.</p> <p>I was so hot to see her and was not only a bit excited by the suggestion. When we sat down on the bed I started to take things further.</p> <p>"Are you sure it's okay? Here I thought I'd get it ready for you and it may look better, but it won't get that way."</p> <p>"Really? I don't think I'll have any problem getting it on. I'm sure it looks good."</p> <p>"Are you sure and your breasts are so gorgeous?" I teased.</p> <p>"I'm sure," she replied.</p> <p>"OK then, we're both going to get it on and it will be fantastic," I replied. "Let's get into our bed first."</p> <p>I lay down on her right side and she started to massage my thigh slowly. She took her time and moved very slowly up and down. The thought of her wearing nothing under all that sexy material excited me even more.</p> <p>As she got more turned on I reached for her breasts and took them in my hands. I massaged them with my whole body and the whole of her body. I pulled on them and pinched her nipples until he moaned with pleasure. I moved down to her stomach and kissed her stomach. I kept kissing her belly button and it was making her breathe harder. It was a good feeling and I moved down to her pussy. I lifted up her legs with my knee and opened it wide and moved my tongue closer and closer to her pussy lips. Then I took them in my mouth and took as much of it in as I could. It was intoxicating.</p> <p>"I told you it was going to taste so good, you really should come on this," she whispered.</p> <p>"Oh, it really does," I replied.</p> <p>She reached down and took mine into her hands and slowly moved them up and down the front of my thigh. I could feel that she was stroking my dick with her hands and she was loving it. I moved between her legs and she took my dick in her hand and held it. She licked the head and I could hear her moaning. She had her lips around the head and was licking the shaft and moving up to the head.</p> <p>That got me as close on my orgasm as I had ever been. I wanted to see her face. I wanted to eat her pussy. I would have taken some of it up my butt, but I couldn't bring myself to do that.</p> <p>She took myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
