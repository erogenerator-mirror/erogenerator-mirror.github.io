Tom asked, sounding a little less interested in the whole thing than the woman he was with but he was glad to see her smiling as they shook hands.</p> <p>"So far, you just said you weren't gay. Are you just gay?" she asked him looking at him intently. She was smiling as she looked back at the computer screen. She was also rubbing down the front of her teddy.</p> <p>Maddie was looking at some pictures on another monitor, "Oh, uh, no, I am not gay."</p> <p>"What's your last name then?" he asked.</p> <p>"Pardon?"</p> <p>"Never mind, just ask me to show you anything," Tom laughed.</p> <p>"You can't possibly think I am gay?"</p> <p>"You're kidding, right? I am surprised. I assumed you are one in the same. I am not the only one that has a preference like that."</p> <p>"I guess I am a little old for your age?"</p> <p>"I'd say so."</p> <p>"I don't mean to pry, and I shouldn't even tell you that you are old but I just thought if you had an interest in this video I'd show it to you and you'd be interested. I'm your age and I'll probably love it too. And don't you dare take it with you when Tom finishes. I'll show it to you later."</p> <p>Tom took his cell out and dialed a number, he didn't think the woman would recognize the number. He was surprised that the woman's voice rang out. He heard someone say that the video was of a man and a woman.</p> <p>"Who is what you're talking about?" Tom said to Maddie. She sounded excited, but didn't make a sound like she was coming out of a well meant dream.</p> <p>He called out to the woman on the other end, "Who is this phone?"</p> <p>"It's Miss. Maddie Carter."</p> <p>"Ms. Carter? I'm calling to see how I can have you on tape saying I can watch all this. I'm not going to sit around waiting to be told my name and watch it."</p> <p>He heard her say, "Please!"</p> <p>"Yes?" he replied. The woman said, "I won't be able to hear that, thank you so much. That phone."</p> <p>Tom hung up and sat down on a bench, "Oh! Yes, I have it on tape with me. I'd like to see it."</p> <p>Maddie looked the other way and said, "I like that."</p> <p>"Well, I'll be there in a minute. I've still got it on. I'd like you to be completely honest when you have sex with another person. It won't hurt anyone."</p> <p>"How?" she asked.</p> <p>Tom asked, "What do you think about that?"</p> <p>Maddie took a deep breath, "I think about a man all the time."</p> <p>"Maddie? Are you mad?" he asked.</p> <p>Maddie took both sides of the phone and said, "I'm not mad. I'm just surprised that you want me as your subject. I'll admit that you may think of me as pretty because it didn't take much for me to pick you up at the airport." She sounded really nervous, but her voice sounded calm, "Please."</p> <p>Tom heard her voice, "How long have you been talking to me? You shouldn't think so much about things."</p> <p>She said, "I guess I can ask the same question. The only things in my life that compare to what I'm doing right now are what my son is doing now; the way I like it. And you? I'm sure that you are a healthy young man."</p> <p>"Yes?"</p> <p>"I really like it. I like being with a young man. I think I've found just what I was looking for after watching you and Tom's video. I don't think my husband knows what I am even thinking." And she was looking at her phone now. "I want to have some fun with Tom, and Tom is willing to do it. I have never taken a man in my husband before. That's okay, I like sex to be with a man, well except in the bedroom. Tom is kind of the guy in that category." Maddie laughed.</p> <p>Tom said, "I think maybe a little experimentation is in order, I think you have been looking at my brother and sister."</p> <p>She looked at him and said, "Do you still have my phone?"</p> <p>"Yes, yes I do," he answered. Maddie looked shocked and looked like she was about to cry.</p> <p>Maddie leaned down and held her hand over her face and said, "I don'tâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
