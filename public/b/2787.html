Her arms rested flat on the table back with her feet either side of me, her body pressed into mine. We had never even looked at each other except for once in a long time. She looked gorgeous sitting there in her black and pink striped dress, her eyes closed, her hair tied into a tight ponytail, and her head tilted to one side.</p> <p>"Wow," I managed with a smile.</p> <p>"Wow? Do you like it?"</p> <p>"I love it."</p> <p>"It is wonderful. Are you feeling...excited?"</p> <p>"Yes," I said with a laugh.</p> <p>"What is it?"</p> <p>"I have a crush on your daughter."</p> <p>"Well, I am not. I was not even aware of her. Now that things have settled down a little, I do not think I will ever see you again. Do you?"</p> <p>I thought this over for a minute and decided to break the silence between us.</p> <p>"Of course I will love you. I know how much women like you."</p> <p>"Are you still attracted to me?"</p> <p>"I think I have always liked you. I will be glad to return the favor for now."</p> <p>She smiled.</p> <p>"It is nice to meet you."</p> <p>I returned the smile.</p> <p>"I'm glad you made it," I said. "I don't usually drink at my own home."</p> <p>She laughed.</p> <p>"I am sorry. It is just that I have never met a woman who made me feel like I am attracted to..." she trailed off and sighed.</p> <p>She looked away, then back to me.</p> <p>"Are you interested in a relationship with me? A more...experienced relationship?"</p> <p>"No. Yes. I have not done that yet, but...I will admit that what I am interested may be a little more than what you are."</p> <p>"You are very attractive. That is part of your charm. You have great legs, but your body is so smooth, that it is almost a turn on."</p> <p>"Yes and no. Not yet, even for a woman, but there will come a time."</p> <p>"Do you like girls?"</p> <p>"There is one, but she is my age... I feel safe."</p> <p>She thought for a moment and then said, "I would prefer you to have a relationship with a lesbian."</p> <p>"That's a little too dramatic."</p> <p>"Come on, let me take your hand."</p> <p>I did and we started the walk down the hallway toward her bedroom. She stopped at her dresser and picked up the bottom of it and turned toward me. Standing in front of me, she looked into my eyes with her beautiful gray-blue eyes.</p> <p>"You are very cute."</p> <p>I felt her put a finger to my lips to shush me. She ran a finger down my jaw and up, then slipped it inside my mouth. She then kissed me again. Her tongue explored the inside my mouth where it met my hot and wet tongue. Her hand came around me again and put a second finger into my pussy. My legs went weak in my high heels as I moaned into the kiss.</p> <p>This woman was so hot. She had always been very attractive but had never really gone all the way. The sex in my apartment had ended before we had even begun to be intimate, so now, I didn't know what to expect.</p> <p>A deep breath and she broke the kiss off. As I stood up, the buttons of my dress came loose, then pulled it down over my breasts and onto the bed at my feet. Her eyes traveled up my body, taking in the fullness of my breasts, the little bumps on my stomach and the way my pussy was exposed to her.</p> <p>I walked over to her and we embraced again, as she began to undress me. I pulled off the dress and threw it on the floor, followed by her bra. We kissed again, our hands exploring the rest of the other's body. I felt the waistband of her panties, then lifted my face.</p> <p>"You are very sexy," she whispered. "Let me see."</p> <p>She pushed her body into mine and my hands slid down her back until they reached the bottom of her ass, then I cupped and lifted it from underneath. I felt her body shiver at my touch and I turned her around. We kissed again and I knelt down, feeling my breasts with my hands and running my tongue across her nipples, her areola with her finger. She moaned loudly and put a hand to the back of my head.</p> <p>"Kiss me...please, kiss me and feel me..."</p> <p>I lowered my face into the silky skin of her breasts and ran my tongue and lips over her skin, asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
