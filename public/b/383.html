She began to move back to meet him as he began to fuck her in earnest. The thrusting in and out of her pussy was hard and quick, and he pounded hard and fast into her. Then she leaned forward at her waist and her hand reached under each of her breasts and began to tweak her nipples with one hand. She began to grunt as he slammed into her.</p> <p>The two of them seemed to orgasm together, and soon they were both shaking violently. He pulled out and rolled her onto her back and he pushed his cock inside her as she grasped his shoulders for support.</p> <p>"Are you about to cum again?" I asked. "I could wait."</p> <p>"I'm just about to," he said. "Don't get me wrong, it felt too good to stop."</p> <p>The three of us started to fuck, hard, fast and deep. The feeling of the two cocks inside me as our combined juices flowed past his cock was indescribably fantastic. Suddenly I was aware of a noise and realized his cock was spurting inside my own woman. As he pushed the rest of his sperm into her, I continued to stroke my own clit while we fucked at each point. A few times I stopped to catch my breath but most of the rest of the action went on as his cock jerked his sperm into her pussy until he was dry. We all collapsed and lay there in exhaustion, totally drained of energy.</p> <p>"If you'd give me such a chance, I'll get a hotel room and you can stay there. I have a room in a really good part of town, and I wouldn't want to be disturbed," she said.</p> <p>We both smiled and said, "That might be an interesting night."</p> <p>"It sure was!" she said. "It was very erotic."</p> <p>We fell into each other's arms and slept until dawn. Later in the day, I found some of her panties in the hotel bag under the pillow under the bed. I brought them into the room and they were in the bed, and we both smelled sex. I got some coffee and we looked at each other. She gave me a kiss and said:</p> <p>"It was an amazing experience, and I couldn't get you out of mind for awhile. The sex was amazing but, you know, there wasn't anything that could be construed as 'doing anything' or 'trying anything' in bed. In fact, the feeling of being with you, even if it was for a short time, was really intense." I had to laugh.</p> <p>"So, you're not even angry about it?" I asked. "What made you think that you can do that to me again?"</p> <p>"Because you've never, ever, done that to me, and I guess it was pretty, but for some reason it was hard. I'm sorry I ever said it that way." I really wasn't offended but I couldn't stop thinking about the other girls at the party and just wanting to see them again, even if they only got there, and even after the fact. "You know I do love you, you know."</p> <p>"And you can't really hate me for that?" she said.</p> <p>"Of course you can!" I said, a little too loudly.</p> <p>She leaned back and hugged me.</p> <p>"I love you," she told me. "And I know I am falling in love with you, but I want us to be together."</p> <p>"So you feel that about me?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh, yes. You are very good to me."</p> <p>We both laughed and she pushed back down on the bed. He took the panties out and put them between her legs to wipe the juices.</p> <p>"Let's go to bed," he said. "I love you and only you better."</p> <p>"I love you too," I said. "And I know the feeling."</p> <p>We both slept very well, even though I knew that nothing could ever compareâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
