I immediately thought of the way you looked down, and how aroused I had become by the whole scene. But after a while, I managed to regain control after the initial shock of that. I quickly started to walk toward you, and when I reached you, you said, "Shhhhh!" then, "Please, no. I have to put him away." I looked at you in disappointment, and you told me that, "Yes, you will." I then closed the door, and walked to the door, opened it, and went inside. With a sigh, I said, "Thank you, and thank you for your time." I then walked to your desk, and opened it. Inside was a stack of photos that I had taken during our trip to town, and they were the pictures of you that I had taken last night. I stood staring at them for an awfully long time before shaking my head in disbelief. Then I turned and walked back to your desk, where you had set your papers down on your desk.</p> <p>As I closed the door to your office, I could tell that you were going to see something that I had not expected. "Why did you call me at the front desk?" you asked. "I would be glad to come to your office and talk to you. What's wrong?" "I got into an accident while driving. The driver of the car got out of control, and I had to call 911. It took me weeks to recover my car. If I hadn't, I would have gotten caught fucking and sucking a few young, beautiful, naked guys." "Well, if she comes, call her, I will see them. Don't worry about it."</p> <p>I walked back over to you. I kneeled and put a finger to your lips, and you simply said, "Shhhhh." I felt a hand on the back of my head. It was your hand, and while you were a short distance away, I could have easily wrapped my finger around yours and moved it to the front. So I slowly moved my hands from your face to your chest, which was already breathing heavily from the excitement of not only the pictures and the memory session we had just had, but the sight of you.</p> <p>After a lot of long, slow and deliberate discussion, I was sure you were ready to be touched. So I did...I kissed your chest, slowly down to your waist, and started to unbutton your jeans. The zipper was pulled down in a matter of seconds. At last, your black pants were open, and I saw the swollen swollen head of your cock. I looked up at you as you stared down at me, and for a moment, you told me not to stop, or I would just have to leave right now. I simply nodded my head and kissed you on the lips, then your neck, and finally on the side of your cheek, and finally on your lips. We kissed a long time, passionately, and I felt the kiss of the most exquisite feelings I have ever felt.</p> <p>After a few moments, you came to kneel beside me, and I took your hand, and led it away from me. You then took my hand, and pulled it to your mouth, and I wrapped my fingers around your cock. I slowly licked the head of your cock, and made it twitch. After a few moments of licking, you had a second erection, and you pulled my head closer. I wrapped my arms around you, and you pressed me down to your chest until my head was under your body, kissing me like a lover. Once you had finished, I went back to your lap, and again opened my mouth and kissed your tip. I held it while I was kissing and sucking.</p> <p>Again, I felt a warm hand caress behind my neck, and then it went to the small of my back. Your hand slid there. It slowly went higher, until I felt it moving up toward my ass, and just before it came to rest between my cheeks, I felt the warmth of another couple of fingers, one from my mouth, and one that belonged to someone. You put more on, and I could feel the hardness of your cock in the palm of my hand, and I started to pump it. With your head on my shoulder, my tongue moved down your shaft, and I licked and sucked on the mushroom of your head. Each time, I took a little more into my mouth, and when I went down on your cock head, I could see some of my saliva and that was now covering your swollen wet cock head. One more suck, and the fingers from your other hand slidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
