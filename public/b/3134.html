I said. "I thought you might hate it, but I like it a lot! Can't wait to see those pretty lips! I'd really love to get to meet her!"</p> <p>"You mean that, you'd like to meet her?" she said. Then turning my attention around at the table I had her in a big embrace, her tongue in my mouth and our bodies pressed together.</p> <p>"Definitely," I said, "but I will be a lot happier when we have some privacy!"</p> <p>"I'd be happy to spend just the weekend with you, if you'd like," she said, "and that was all I could think of!"</p> <p>Taking a sip of wine I said, "Actually I would like that just as much, so just tell me and we'll have the weekend to ourselves."</p> <p>"Okay, I'll tell you, but just promise that you'll be a little shy! There are a lot of things that some people need to know about us," she said. "You've got to keep your virginity, at least for now!"</p> <p>"Oh, I won't have to wait too long! I already gave your mother my virginity," I said. "And she was very happy about it; I've even heard she has two babies ready."</p> <p>"So you can take her now while I'm gone," she said.</p> <p>"Yeah! I can't wait!" I said. With that I set back and watched as she slowly and gracefully removed her jacket, letting it dangle softly onto her shoulders, then quickly dropping the blouse to the floor. When she was naked she dropped her skirt to the floor and it joined her blouse, then her bra. She bent over at the waist and removed the stockings, and as she turned and started to put her shoes on she turned to me to say "I've only just had time to shower, remember! I have to change my makeup!" I stood with a look of bewilderment, but also with a bit of pride.</p> <p>"Oh, is that what you do for a living, baby?" she said. "And why don't you just try shaving that beautiful ass of yours? You'll find what you like so much there. And don't forget the clippers on the bottom shelf! You're going to love it!"</p> <p>"Well I hope so," I said, "and I mean it!"</p> <p>"Honey! I don't know what to say. I think I like that... that..." she said, laughing. She reached out and touched my face, pulling me to her. She was warm and soft, with eyes that looked only faintly like mine, but a kind of blue-gray, not like mine, but almost like the color of my own, but with more of a blueish tint. My hands instinctively slid to her bare and round ass, but then she leaned into the kiss, pressing her body against me and pressing her breasts against my naked chest.</p> <p>"I don't think I should try and pretend that I like it, too," she said. "Just tell me how it feels, because..."</p> <p>With that she dropped her hands to my lap, unzipping my pants and quickly pulling it and my pants off. She then pushed me back and sat back to look at me.</p> <p>"Are you sure that's what you really want, baby?" she asked. "Do you really want to know what that feeling is like?" Looking down she could see that I was erect. Looking back up to my face she could see that I was also very aroused and felt my body tense as she looked at me with desire, the look in her eyes telling me that even I could tell how excited she was.</p> <p>"It's real," I said. "It feels like, all in one fell swoop, so soft and warm, like a mother's hand."</p> <p>She reached up and started to gently comb through my hair, then pulled it back and took a deep breath of air while looking down, then smiled at me.</p> <p>"Good, I've not had any experience with a boy, so I don't get much experience with girls either," she said.</p> <p>"I know," I replied and leaned up to kiss her. She opened herself for me and immediately returned me in return. Her hands were soft and gentle as we kissed. After an incredible few moments, as the heat built I could wait no longer and I pushed her back and slid out of bed, taking the edge of the sheet and placing it over her shoulders. My other hand started exploring the curves of her hips and thighs and ass. She was incredibly sensual; she always was, especially when being with me, and this time she showed no restraint.
