"We're not allowed into the city. Those guards, you do know of?"</p> <p>"It is a city and people."</p> <p>"And what happens within it, then?"</p> <p>"We'll be kept on an island until we can find our way."</p> <p>He smiled. "Very well, gentlemen and ladies. I'll leave you to it."</p> <p>His final words were quiet.</p> <p>He didn't know of anyone who would hear them. It was unheard of. And yet, he just knew that his time was limited.</p> <p>He made a motion to him at the door when his escort walked back through it with a big smile on his face.</p> <p>The walk to the elevator was slow and awkward. He was so eager to get into his cab, that he almost tripped on the door handle.</p> <p>He quickly stepped off of the elevator and pulled off his coat. The man didn't even acknowledge him when he opened the door for him. The guard was in a hurry to get off the elevator when he saw the smile on Tom's face.</p> <p>"Here we are."</p> <p>"Thank you."</p> <p>He looked back for more of the man's expression but didn't see anyone anywhere. Then he was in the elevator and suddenly the man's face turned. He gave the man a smile as he walked past him.</p> <p>"My name is Alex, Alex Evans."</p> <p>The other man said something else as the elevator dropped him off in the empty cab. His companion waved Tom's way out the door. Tom's companion smiled back just before he closed the door and turned to the man.</p> <p>"I know you're looking for a job, Tom. I'm a businessman. But I'm also a traveler. Are you interested?"</p> <p>Tom could feel his heart beating. This was so absurd!</p> <p>He'd been given an apartment by a pretty girl. That had somehow just seem... right after all this. No! He didn't want to get into anything with this. He'd never even considered anyone else in that way. He'd never even considered anyone else with her body at all. But here he was. Standing in her doorway, and the man had just said something which made him want to do more with him than just be a passenger. And... Alex had said what they'd said was wrong. But no more, less than a mile away. He knew in this world a man had to do things with a woman, be things with her, be good things with her. But he didn't.</p> <p>"I.. I'm... I.." Tom stammered. He'd lost his courage. He'd lost his courage.</p> <p>"I know what you want. You're a pretty woman. And for some reason, I'd like you to do something for me."</p> <p>"You... you want me to... to... to..." Tom trailed off. And then realized he sounded like an insecure man. "I don't know how to speak to women!"</p> <p>The man looked at him for a long moment before leaning across the seat. He reached out and placed his hands on the man's shoulders, sliding them down the man's arms and back.</p> <p>Tom swallowed hard. He'd always been shy. Now it might look stupid, but his shyness just seemed to evaporate.</p> <p>"I think you can do something for me. We'll start with something. I think you're very beautiful."</p> <p>And then he started talking.</p> <p>"I would like to, uh, I mean, I like to be... you know, I know some of what this is but, I'm still unsure I get it just right... I just want you to look at me."</p> <p>The man smiled. "You want me too, don't you?"</p> <p>"Yes." Tom could hear it in his tone but the only thought in front of him was what it felt like to have the man stare at him, but instead of turning it away, Tom was caught in an emotional state which was not his usual, and probably not usually, mood. He nodded.</p> <p>"That's very nice of you." Alex took in a deep breath. "I don't just mean that sort of things. I mean what I said about looking at you and being interested in you. That's what you need to do. Is that something you want to do?"</p> <p>"Well, no. It's... no, I don't want to do anything with you."</p> <p>"Do you think I should tell the man what he already knows, or will say if everything goes right?"</p> <p>"Maybe."</p> <p>"I want you to get back inside my city."</p> <p>"Thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
