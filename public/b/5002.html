She started to cry. She began to moan again. Her eyes were squeezed shut tight and she was crying almost nonstop now. They were tears of pain, tears of happiness, tears of relief, tears of love. She continued to grind her pussy into the table harder.</p> <p>"Oh no," she thought out loud. "That could be real fun. Can I do it?"</p> <p>Without warning she began to lose control of her hips. Her eyes bulged. She began to cum. She arched her back and cried out. She let go of everything but her mind...her eyes and body. Her pussy clamped down hard on her fingers. She began to cum once more. She began to lose control of her self.</p> <p>"Oh God." She thought. "That was so hot. Can I do it again?" She could still feel her pussy tighten and tighten. What was happening to her? This was not her game. She didn't know where this was going. She stopped trying to hold herself steady and concentrated on what was happening beneath her. She continued to fuck her fingers into the table under her skirt. She continued to finger herself until her hips began to twitch on their own and her orgasm rolled into it's own time. She leaned into the table and pulled her fingers away from her.</p> <p>For several minutes she lay on the table gasping. She slowly pulled her finger from the table and cleaned it then cleaned off what she held in her hand.</p> <p>"Oh God," she thought. "My first. God. My first. I can't believe how stupid that was." But she couldn't deny how she felt. It was wrong but it felt good. There was something special about doing that.</p> <p>"I should probably go. We are only getting started." She walked unsteadily in her clothes toward the door.</p> <p>She stopped and looked around the apartment. Her heart skipped a beat. She knew that there would be cameras. There should be. And she was worried about them.</p> <p>"Do you have a boyfriend?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"I'd like to see you again."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"What time should we pick you up?"</p> <p>"Eight o'clock."</p> <p>"So I'll just go to work, you going to see other people, and not see me?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>She walked back into her bedroom and began to get dressed. She stood in front of the mirror in the room and tried to decide. She looked at her body again and wondered what was happening to her. She smiled at her hands. She had this good body. She began to dress...her hips swayed. She pulled her skirt down. She lifted each leg, then her jacket to her waist, and pulled it on. She put her hair in a bun and grabbed the bag and purse she'd brought with her. She put the keys and car keys into the pockets and grabbed the key ring. She walked out of her apartment.</p> <p>"I'll be late," she told herself.</p> <p>She took her time, making sure not to make too much of anything but the key ring. She got to her car, pulled in, backed out, turned around, then left. She drove back to the building and made it past the security and security system's door and into the building. She was inside her own building. She went to a front desk. She looked up and was surprised to see a man, middle aged looking.</p> <p>"Can I help you?" she asked.</p> <p>"You can't just do this without my information," he said coldly.</p> <p>"I'm at work."</p> <p>"What kind of work?"</p> <p>"Oh, I work for a marketing company. That's what I do."</p> <p>"Ah ah."</p> <p>"Have you finished your shift early?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"I'm sorry to bother you. My name is Richard."</p> <p>"Call me Richard."</p> <p>"Please, my name is Rebecca."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, Rebecca will get my next shift."</p> <p>As she hung up the phone he said to her, "And I'm not interested in a relationship."</p> <p>"It will do nothing for me to be a little upset. I've watched you and your father. I'm married. Just let me know when you're ready to have lunch. Maybe we can get together sometime."</p> <p>"Yes, that would be nice," he said. "I'll be waiting for youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
