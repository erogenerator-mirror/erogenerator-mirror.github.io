She could tell from the way he touched her, and her lips, the touch and her eyes, he wanted her.</p> <p>He pulled him to the edge of the boat, his eyes never leaving her. He wanted her desperately. "What is our code?" he asked in a quiet voice.</p> <p>"I don't understand you," she breathed.</p> <p>"What do you get me for not answering your question?"</p> <p>"Your name?"</p> <p>"Nope." He smiled softly at her. He loved her, she was adorable. His tongue flickered against one of her nipples.</p> <p>"What?" She said innocently.</p> <p>"Oh don't I know." He rolled his eyes and took her hand, leading her back out to board the boat. "You have to remember me, this would be a perfect test for you."</p> <p>****</p> <p>It was a small craft. The top was over half way down the boat, and the tail was tied. As he walked along the back deck, holding her hand as her body swayed with excitement, he asked her a few questions about the life of the ship. She said she had never been to an Earth dock before. He knew, from looking at her, she was new, so she was new to this world. They talked in her seat as she watched stars slowly dance, and he took her hand, walking her to the boat's side.</p> <p>Leaning the front of her shirt against the warm night air he asked her how old she was.</p> <p>"I'm forty" she told him truthfully, in a voice that was both soft and sultry.</p> <p>"Would you like a ride tonight?" He asked when they got to the boat.</p> <p>"I'm game."</p> <p>"Where do you live?"</p> <p>"San Diego"</p> <p>"Great" he put her hand on the doorknocker of the stern, lifting her to the middle of the boat as she sat very comfortably. She looked around, to see a beautiful summer sunset and the ocean before her eyes. "How about dinner?" he asked, and she said yes.</p> <p>"Good"</p> <p>"You had a good night, but now you have to be ready."</p> <p>****</p> <p>He helped her with her dress, as she held the neck to help her walk. He was careful to keep her waist low around her neck, as the dress would come down over her breasts. He pulled on the fabric, and the dress fell over her shoulders, falling away from her breasts in waves. He admired them in his mind as he held the dress, looking at her long legs framed in fishnet stockings that ran from the tops of her black thigh-highs to the tops of her black fishnet stockings. He stepped back to view her and saw, her eyes and then her whole appearance. He put a finger under her chin, bending down to kiss her full lips. Their mouths were wet and moving back and forth together, their tongues playing together. It was not a long passionate kiss, but a deep and passionate kiss worthy of anything she had ever experienced.</p> <p>He stood over her and took her hand, leading her back to the bow, which was secured by a rope. Once there, he guided her to a bench in the bow, in the stern of the boat, under the starlight and the ocean. As she sat down, he stood behind her, his hands on her thighs, slowly sliding up to her backside, stopping just before they reached the apex of her legs. Taking her hand in his hands, he kissed her from the tips to the tops, looking in her eyes, looking right into hers as they pressed together in a passionate soul-kiss. He pulled his hands away, and she moved to kiss him, but he reached out and pulled her back and held her as they kissed.</p> <p>He looked in her eyes, searching for what she wanted. It was hard knowing, but she wanted this.</p> <p>"I want..." he said. "I want you. I want you to want."</p> <p>"Yes," he kissed her again, then pulled back again, "I want you. I'll be waiting for you." He bent down and looked into her eyes. "I will be your first. We'll do everything together."</p> <p>Leaning forward, he laid his lips next to hers as he continued to stroke her thigh. His hand went up again, to her breasts, as his hands caressed her, feeling her nipples, moving up to her breasts, finding them, he held them for her, feeling, feeling.</p> <p>He moved his hands down, feeling her panties, feeling the fabric, and cupped them, feeling her. Slowly pulling her panties down, he watched her face, seeing what she wanted as she looked back at him.
