I have a great time and you're a smart girl to look at. The more I enjoy you, the better I'll enjoy you the less I have to worry about you hurting me. By the end, I'd give almost a million pounds in a couple of months if I could do that to you."</p> <p>I couldn't let his cock go anytime, and I couldn't deny I wanted it again, and I was ready to do him again.</p> <p>I stood up and he lifted my skirt up and pulled my panties to one side over my pussy; his cock rubbed up and down my slippery lips and he moaned in pleasure.</p> <p>I leaned forward, my hands on his chest. His hands ran up my ribs, to my breasts, where they played a lively game with his fingers. His hand went to my right breast and then slid around to my right to cup my sex fully, my nipple hard and swollen. His finger traced the length of my pussy, my nipple and his thumb stroked me in soft teasing circles, as his fingers found their way to my clit.</p> <p>A muffled moan escaped me as his fingers stroked me and my clit was hard and swollen. His fingers teased my clit and slipped inside me with a firm thrusting that made me crazy. His breath caught a beat and then his breath took an unexpected change of pace when it felt as if he would explode if I let him continue. One finger then another slid inside me and slid my clit over the ridges where it ran down the length of his shaft. "Yes. Finger fuck me," I growled and he stopped and said "Wait for me?" I opened my legs and pushed them around him, and he lay down on me as his fingers worked me over.</p> <p>I gasped and pushed myself back onto him as I tried to get as much of him inside me as I could but it was impossible. Finally, I had to force the hand back down to my sex, gripping him tightly and pulling him down with me.</p> <p>I was close but I couldn't give him the satisfaction of his self-control. Finally, I pushed him up and said, "We need to do something else," and I quickly straddled him, keeping my legs apart for balance but letting my hands go to work. With his hands on my hips, I lifted so my weight dropped down and pushed up on his hard cock with my hand.</p> <p>"Oh, God," I moaned and began a slow but powerful fucking motion. My fingers were on his erection, caressing it, rubbing against the length of my clit, as he stroked me with his fingers. Then suddenly, before he could fuck me, I rolled over, taking him with me. "That feels so good," I purred. "I can't believe I'm saying this, it's so incredible."</p> <p>"It looks so much better from your perspective." He moaned, then added, "Yeah. More to come!" as his fingers began to work on both nipples as my hands moved over his cock, feeling it, caressing it, fondling his balls, massaging his shaft. "Fucking awesome," he gasped. His hand left my breasts and returned to my sex; stroking me and probing me with his fingers and cock. I moaned into his ear, "I want to get naked with you in a 69 position and suck your cock. And I want to see your face when I do."</p> <p>His hand dropped to my sex and stroked my slit for a bit, and then he took me from his mouth and slid on a condom just before we entered him. I got on my hands and knees, offering my breasts to him while he lay on his back on the bed. My hand massaged his cock, as I knelt beside him, his hand guiding mine up and down his shaft while he reached up and cupped my breasts, his fingers caressing my nipples. I moved my mouth over his cockhead, kissing it, then stroking it with my hand, flicking it with my tongue.</p> <p>He whispered under his breath, "You taste amazing, and you're so fucking sexy." Our bodies shifted together until I was on all fours, his head between my thighs, and I felt him position his tip at the entrance of my sex.</p> <p>I cried out, "I can't, I can't." His mouth closed over my breast and he sucked hard, as he pushed in past my lips, entering me. His cock sank deeply into me as he held the bottom of my body and thrust himself forward to meet me.
