I felt wonderful. And I knew she had an orgasm. This time it wasn't so bad. What I hadn't counted on was that I was going to come again. And it got better. I didn't even realize that she was coming from me being in her pussy for the last time. I was in heaven.</p> <p>After the third release, and I got up off her body to let her recover from her orgasm, we cleaned up in the bathroom. Once we had cleaned up we decided it was time to get dressed and get the van ready to leave.</p> <p>We made the drive without a word and just before we pulled in, Mom turned and saw Becky standing there looking at us saying out loud, "Oh, my God." And then she got up walked into us hugging us and kissing our cheek.</p> <p>Mom turned to Becky and said, "Thanks honey, Mom's going to be at the club for at least a couple more hours until we get back home."</p> <p>Becky was crying as she whispered, "Please don't go...I just want to be with you."</p> <p>Mom hugged Becky as I said, "You know we're going to be in tomorrow and next Saturday together. I want to show Mom how very different a woman is from a man."</p> <p>Becky was smiling and said, "I'm so glad to have your love...you know how much you mean to me."</p> <p>My answer was to kiss Mom back and tell her, "That we had a lot to talk about. But I think tonight, at least tonight, Becky's a man now."</p> <p>Mom stepped and hugged both of us back and said, "I'm going to get a shower and start getting dinner ready. We'll all join you guys after dinner."</p> <p>I could feel both of our hearts as we walked toward the door. We kissed all three of us then looked over at Becky and Becky quickly turned and followed Mom through the front door.</p> <p>Once we got into the car Mom asked, "Well, what did you think of our little honeymoon?"</p> <p>Becky hugged and thanked Mom for the time with her. She reached for my hand and said, "If Mom and I weren't so tired, I'd be at the club all night."</p> <p>I looked at Mom and said with a smile, "You know that I love you."</p> <p>I leaned over and kissed her. "I love you too."</p> <p>We talked as we drove the five miles to the club. As we talked Becky kissed me lightly on the lips as I drove. I wondered what she was thinking as she looked at my rear view mirror. Maybe she wasn't thinking as much as she thought she was thinking. I knew Mom was as turned on as she could be knowing Becky was going to be there.</p> <p>The club became obvious as it was closer to home. That night, as Becky and I danced I got so close to her I could feel the warmth of her body and her breasts in my pants. When I pressed my groin against hers and reached around with one hand to feel her breast, Becky's kiss was as passionate.</p> <p>While we danced Becky asked, "So what do you guys like to drink now?"</p> <p>Mom said, "We'll need to get you something to take you home home so you can't drive away from there."</p> <p>Becky grinned and said, "We can do that. But let me tell dad before he leaves..."</p> <p>Mom said, "Honey, I'm just happy to be able to be with you as often as I can without you needing to come on to me. Mom loves her Dad and knows how to treat me."</p> <p>We each took a sip of our drinks and then headed to the exit. We were walking home in record time. Neither Becky's nor mine felt like talking at this point.</p> <p>When we reached Mom's car Becky said, "Mom, you know how jealous I am that you have got the love of such a wonderful man beside you?"</p> <p>Mom just smiled and leaned over to kiss Becky's lips. "I would bet you'd be jealous of the way I feel, if I was the jealous one."</p> <p>Becky smiled and said, "Mom, when he's on me, I know he's loving me more than you. Every time he's with you, I see his face and know he's loving you. He just loves being with you and I know he loves being with me. I love him all the way."</p> <p>Mom reached down and cupped my balls while she said, "I'm sure he loves being with you as much as he loves being with me."</p> <p>"I know you're right," Becky said.</p> <p>When our cars were out of sight, we kissed each other and Becky said, "That's going to be my last night togetherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
