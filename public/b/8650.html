He closed his eyes and thought about all the things he could and couldn't do right then. His head was filled with images of everything he had done before sex just lately. But he didn't think he had the strength to do much right now. "I could go on and do my thing some other time, but I'd like to save it for another time," he said with a sigh, his voice waver with worry.</p> <p>He sat there, watching Rachel move around the room in her black dress. Maybe she did this on purpose. Maybe she's into the bondage stuff. Was he going to ask her to use a dildo or something? Would she use anything?</p> <p>A thought occurred to him as he finished dressing, "But then I'd probably be in really bad shape."</p> <p>Rachel put one of her shoes on and put her feet in the other.</p> <p>"But I don't have anything, don't I?" Rachel asked.</p> <p>"I'm not sure that you need any more information."</p> <p>"And I don't need any of this bullshit from anyone." Rachel smiled widely, "What would you care to be, anyway?" Rachel finished her shoe and sat down at the far end of the bed. It was as if the room suddenly was on auto-pilot, not knowing what was coming next.</p> <p>"I should go."</p> <p>Rachel got off the bed and ran off with her husband to get changed and then get cleaned up. She had to change as well after all she had been through. In her haste, she didn't even have time to do anything. She raced after Chad. She jumped into his arms, "I love you Chad." She kissed him on the lips. "Thank you for loving me. I love you too. You're the best person to ever love," She kissed him again so quick that no one had a chance to react.</p> <p>They hugged for a brief second longer than necessary before Chad ran to the bathroom to get something in there. He grabbed a towel and cleaned up the mess he had made. He was just finishing washing his hands when he saw Rachel coming out of the bathroom, a sly smile on her face. "You going to go in with me?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm about to take a shower," Chad smiled, "Thanks for everything."</p> <p>"No problem," Rachel laughed and got up to meet him downstairs. As they walked down the small corridor, they both got lost in their thoughts. He was surprised to find she had the perfect body for a woman in that short dress. Not too bad looking. He liked the way her breasts pushed out and that her cleavage would just be perfect. He really did like a woman in her underwear or something. He felt his cock press against him, hardening. Rachel was not going to let this situation go by without a plan.</p> <p>"Well you've been a little busy with the business right," he said, glancing down at his hands. "How is the business doing?"</p> <p>"Well, I just finished the interview for a new director."</p> <p>"So we've been talking."</p> <p>Rachel leaned over him and kissed him deeply. The kiss turned into something more. She felt his hands caressing her hips and ass. "I do have a special little surprise for you," she whispered, "I've been waiting for this day, and you are finally going to be coming home."</p> <p>She pressed herself more fully against him as she continued to whisper to him. "Oh yes, I'm so excited," she said as she squeezed his cock.</p> <p>She led him into the kitchen and set him up on a stool. There was a bottle of wine and two glasses and both glasses were filled. Rachel turned around and faced him, showing off her tight body. She smiled as she walked toward him. "I've been making a date with your boss for the next few weeks," she teased.</p> <p>"What kind of date?" Chad was taken slightly aback by this. She was in charge now. He didn't like it.</p> <p>"We should really get started," Rachel said seductively. As she turned her body around, her large breasts jiggled invitingly. "We need to go," Rachel purred.</p> <p>Chad's cock rose again, eager to get into her tight dress. He couldn't wait.</p> <p>"No, no," Rachel said, placing the wine bottle between her large breasts that dangled down with her arms. "This has been a long time for me. I'll make sure I get my part on," Rachel whispered to him as she bent forward to pour the wine. Her massive breasts were now swaying seductively. He could see the tips of her nipples pushing against the tight materialâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
