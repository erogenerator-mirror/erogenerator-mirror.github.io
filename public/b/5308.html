"I am going to bed."</p> <p>"Ok."</p> <p>We kissed, and then he pulled away, and I headed to the bathroom. I went straight to the shower to wash off the residue of my orgasm, which had stung my dick, but I had no intentions of letting it go. I was still mostly hard, but not so much that I was going to cum before I got my legs back under me. I quickly toweled off, brushed my teeth, and went into the bedroom to pack and dress. My suitcase was lying on the vanity by the bed, so I picked it up and went out into the living room where Jason and his friends were sitting talking.</p> <p>"Hey, I was just wondering if you'd want to go out with us again tonight." Jason said.</p> <p>"Sure, it sounds fun."</p> <p>"Great, where is she?"</p> <p>I pointed to the bathroom on the way to the shower. He followed behind me.</p> <p>"She's not in the apartment with you."</p> <p>"Sure, you could get her by asking her what she likes and dislikes, or if she's doing her boyfriend right."</p> <p>"I am sorry, it didn't seem right, I know it's not easy with her being with you guys."</p> <p>He sighed. "So, do you want to go out tonight? We could watch more television, or just play some video games."</p> <p>"I don't really mind having a drink with you guys, but I was going to go out with you guys."</p> <p>She gave my best friend a shy look, then turned to the bathroom door to the right of the door and closed it behind us.</p> <p>"Are you guys okay with this? It sounds like you don't wanna leave me alone."</p> <p>"Sure, if you wanna be with us." Jason said with a grin.</p> <p>"I'm fine with this, thanks."</p> <p>While I watched them walk away, I thought about my ex-girlfriend's words from my previous night. I had never been with a girl as hot as she was. I would definitely love to have sex with her if she was here.</p> <p>"Do you have a place we can go if you want." Kevin asked.</p> <p>"Sure, why not?"</p> <p>"Well, I haven't been to a bar in awhile."</p> <p>"Cool, see you later."</p> <p>"See you later."</p> <p>It was a while, and I finally decided that we went to the pub instead of the restaurant. The place wasn't that busy, maybe it was just me. We had a very nice lunch, and then we had a couple of drinks to take my mind off things. Kevin and I just talked about the movie he had bought me for Christmas. After we sat down to our dinner, we had been drinking more and both were pretty loose, but I didn't notice for a while longer. I started to think this was a nice way to hang out. There were no girls in the place and nobody that I would have minded dancing or whatever. My girlfriend was in the bathroom. I could hear the water running, so I walked over and turned off her light and took a seat at the bar. I ordered a scotch and asked for a rum and coke. I was starting to feel good talking with a guy after everything that had happened tonight. After a little more rum and coke, I decided to ask Kevin what the movie was from, but decided to go along with whatever he was trying to tell me. The movie was about the Vietnam War, where the soldiers were forced into a horrible, brutal war by the Japanese, and were forced to do everything. It was pretty funny.</p> <p>"You should watch this," I said to him as I went to put my drink into my hand.</p> <p>"Yeah, I wanna see the movie."</p> <p>"Great, I'm going to head in now."</p> <p>"I'll be back in a jiff." and he was gone.</p> <p>After talking several minutes and a couple of drinks, I decided my friend needed a beer. I went to the bedroom, sat beside Kevin on the couch, and then slowly drifted away to sleep. The next morning I awoke and went to the bathroom to get ready for work. I couldn't help but notice that I still had not cum. But, I was going to play along with whatever Kevin said, so I went to the office and did. After work, I met up with Kevin and his friends in the city for some burgers. We were having a few drinks and talking like old friends from before. He seemed very friendly with me, and we just got along very well. We finally made some plans and I invited him back to my apartment to watch a movie they had rented a bunch of nights ago. Kevin agreed.</p> <p>"This isâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
