The two of them laughed at the same comment.</p> <p>"I just like a dress that shows a little more," Karen responded. She took Mary's hand and led her to the stairs. "Just relax and enjoy it." Karen smiled at Mary, "It's just a little something for some sexy fun. Now go upstairs and have a bath."</p> <p>Mary stepped up the stairs feeling nervous and yet exhilarated at the same time. She heard the water start running and felt safe with her new friend walking with her. "Karen..."</p> <p>Karen turned around to see Karen's reaction, smiling as she ran up the stairs.</p> <p>Once upstairs Mary turned on the water to warm and asked how it's doing. Karen turned around and said that it did feel better in the hot tub. Mary felt slightly embarrassed but was more then willing to go through with it. Karen went into the kitchen, poured a glass of wine and served up the drinks for the night. They sat together in the big overstuffed armchairs and talked about the situation at hand.</p> <p>"Mary, how did you and Karen first met? Is it a long story?" Karen asked.</p> <p>"I don't have a lot of time for it," Mary replied, "but here is the short version. We were dating in college. I told him about your adventures, and he took me to his parents' house in the middle of town. It seems that they have a swimming pool in there, with hot tubs and hot tubs built into the pool and a big Jacuzzi. That was the beginning of our relationship."</p> <p>"Were we as close to each other as I have ever been to boyfriends," Karen said, "He's been dating me for about a week and the two of us have been spending time at his house. We were actually having sex with each other."</p> <p>"I thought that you would have come to me," Mary said with a mischievous grin, "he's pretty nice and a lot of women my age seem to like what he does. He's got a nice cock too. I know I'll enjoy it in the hot tub when we're done with it." Karen gave Mary a wink and patted the tub with a hand.</p> <p>"I think that he got me really excited about you," Karen said with a grin, "and the hot tub. Did you have any idea of what his cock looks like? I'll bet that you can't get him hard enough to actually feel his cock up in the water."</p> <p>"I only have a handful of good experiences with a guy in our neighborhood, but he's got a nice one I'm sure he's got as well. It's the most beautiful cock I have ever seen." Mary said proudly. After their talk they got up and dried off. Sitting in their guest bathroom Karen turned on the light at the door and closed the door. "We're going to have a little party tonight," she said.</p> <p>"Sounds good to me," Mary agreed as she pulled on her robe. She went back to her room and got a drink of water, sat down on the bed and thought of how much she enjoyed her life. This weekend was going to be good and the last time that she had a good time she was going to be able to see another man's cock in the hot tub.</p> <p>That evening the four of them had a great time and had a great time in bed. When the guys were done at their jobs around the house there were some drinks already served for them. It seemed that some of them weren't so drunk that they couldn't keep the party going. After a glass or two of red wine Karen had a wicked idea. She asked Mary to get the last of their drinks. She started undressing Mary and when she was naked Mary stood in front of Karen.</p> <p>"What do you think you're doing?" Karen asked her. Mary looked at Karen with a puzzled expression on her face.</p> <p>"I'm just taking you to bed," Karen responded. She grabbed Mary's hands and put them on her breasts. "I think that's enough for you," Karen said. She reached under Mary's robe and grabbed her cock with one hand. Karen had been right. It was big and hard as hell. "You see," she said as she started to stroke Mary's cock with her right hand, "if you're a good girl and don't do a bad thing I'll let you do that to me. "</p> <p>Mary looked at Karen questionably. She got the idea that this was what Karen wanted to do. She reached out and cupped Karen's ass, squeezing it. They continued to kiss tenderly. Soon Mary's hand movedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
