She was good with toys and she would let me do anything to her for awhile before she made me cum.</p> <p>She was in a class that Saturday so I was there waiting for her. I hadn't gone home yet and I had a surprise planned. I was going to surprise her.</p> <p>Tiffany came in the room while she was looking for something and was disappointed to see that someone else was watching the TV. She asked why I couldn't answer to me.</p> <p>"Because I need to catch a movie," Tiffany said sarcastically. "I've been watching it all day and I've changed my mind. I'm sorry sweetie. I forgot," she said in her motherly voice.</p> <p>"Tiffany, I don't know what the hell you're talking about. How dare you talk to me like that. That's insulting. Your mom never said what a slut you are. I don't think I'd be mad that much if you got out of bed so quick," I said. "And you're not. You were just so sweet to me. I don't feel insulted."</p> <p>Tiffany looked at me and her eyes seemed to say; 'This is it,' all while she started to walk towards me. Once she got to me, she put her hands out to me and said, "Take me home."</p> <p>After I got in the car, Tiffany went up to her room. About 15 minutes later, my mom knocked on the door. I was wearing shorts, t-shirt and sweat-pants. I told her she looked wonderful. And, when she opened the door to let me in, I was wearing a pair of sweats.</p> <p>My mother saw me in her son's clothes, but didn't call me or ask me the same question. After all, I thought I was her son and she should call me Uncle Jeff.</p> <p>My mom took me into the living room and showed me a seat along the other side and a couple of couches, one on each side. I sat there on the couch while Tiffany sat in the middle.</p> <p>"So Tiffany; I'm going to tell you all about me and you should know something about me and my mom," my mother said. When Tiffany was done explaining everything to her mother, my mother looked at me and said, "Your mom doesn't think you were going to do anything inappropriate with her son." "But I'm sure she'll like it if you do." My mother smiled at me and made her request to sit beside her. She was wearing a tank top that was only pulled down about a third of the way down her chest and exposed her tits. After seeing them all over, she said, "I can tell that you have a nice cock."</p> <p>What the fuck did she just say? I was thinking, 'Well, I have to tell my mom about all of this and it'll be great.'</p> <p>I could feel myself getting harder. "Well, I suppose I could have just told her something that you guys don't have to tell me. What's the big deal? I'll figure it out. It would be fun talking and watching TV."</p> <p>My mother chuckled, "You're right, you're the star in one of Jeff's shows. In fact, I told my friend on campus, your cousin who was in bed with you earlier, what Jeff doesn't know. Maybe I made a big fool of myself. It was good. Jeff and I made up yesterday.</p> <p>"We wanted to surprise you, Tiffany. But I couldn't let things go like that."</p> <p>There was a pause while my mom just stared at me. She waited for me to tell her how I felt about her, but the silence was deafening. When I didn't, she reached out and touched the back of my neck. She just felt me for a second before she said, "Maybe this is wrong and it would be good for us if you didn't like it," then she walked over in front of me and sat down next to Tiffany. As far as my mother was concerned, Tiffany was a different person.</p> <p>She didn't do anything, she just stared at me. Finally she said, "I guess it would be alright with me if you wouldn't ask me anything. I really enjoyed watching you play with yourself and I wanted to watch you do it too. You're the only one I liked watching. It makes me feel good to have you watch me."</p> <p>I think it was at this point that my mother came to me and looked me in the eye. She said, "Please don't judge me about anything that I'm thinking of doing to you. I'm not asking youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
