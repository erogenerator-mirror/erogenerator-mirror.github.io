"I was afraid you were going to go off the mark. You know what people say about you." He looked down at the ground. "You see that woman working in my office today?"</p> <p>I hadn't noticed as quickly and clearly as I had last evening. My own office was right there on and on. "Yeah," I shrugged. "She's the boss. We've had to use a lot of our office space to handle all our business."</p> <p>"It'll be hard to concentrate today," the man shrugged as he walked over to me. I don't like the expression on my face as I looked away. He reached out and put his finger to my lips. "Don't be concerned, I don't have a wife. All I'd like to do is sit here with you." A pause. "I just have a lot of catching up to do. I had a lot of things to discuss for a while, but it was only an hour or so in the office today."</p> <p>He took a deep breath. "It's about you, me, and the woman. I've heard that quite a bit, and I really like it. Do you want to talk to me about the future you're going to have in that office?"</p> <p>I nodded, slowly and a bit nervously. I was still scared and excited at the same time. Maybe I had some idea of what that old saying said, but I wanted to know for certain, so I nodded my head.</p> <p>"And what would your future be?" he asked.</p> <p>"I'd like to work for you," I answered.</p> <p>He shook his head. "It's like your fantasy come true. I can't go back to that office ever." He raised his eyebrows and looked at me. "What?"</p> <p>He hesitated. "I don't know. You know how we've heard about everything we know about the people, the people in the big city. It's not like we've gone by accident. We don't tell the people exactly anything like what we know about you. At least none of that is true."</p> <p>I stared at him, confused. I had come a long way for today, and I'd spent a lot of time with my body and soul. What was there that was really different? That I wasn't all about my body at some point? "It's not that I don't want to be your boss," I said.</p> <p>He nodded. "I would be happy to help you out with that. What I'd like for you to do, is to give a good presentation."</p> <p>He glanced at me, and then looked back to the ground. I knew what he was thinking. His eyes were focused on me as much as mine were on the ground. All I could do was look back.</p> <p>"I'd like to offer you something that will help you learn a lot of things. What is it?" he asked.</p> <p>"It's really hard to say," I said, "but I think I'm going to pass. I'll try to get to know you better, so I can start working, and you can get to know me, and we can talk things over."</p> <p>He nodded, walked over to a filing cabinet and opened the door to the cabinets. He looked back at me, and said, "You see something that might help you decide whether you want to start having a really good work week." He held out a pile of files to me.</p> <p>"What is it? What are you thinking?" I asked. He had a point.</p> <p>I reached for the file on my desk. There was a small box of forms that I felt needed filing. I reached for one of the two boxes and found the first one labeled, "Employee Handbook." I grabbed the box and opened it up, and looked it over. There were a couple of pages here and there and a sheet of numbers in front of each. I held out it in front of me since it was about my job description, but not out of fear of what would happen if I closed my file. I was holding the file in front of me as I handed it to him. He walked over to me and looked at me as he opened the box. "You'll be working in your office with me for awhile, right?" he asked, smiling.</p> <p>"I'll be your personal office consultant for a while, but I'll also be coming to work with you a lot. It's all very normal." I said.</p> <p>"Well, if they say employees have to wait until the morning before they go to work, then they should take it. You're going to be helping me, right?" He said.</p> <p>"Well, that's true.
