What did you want to talk to me about?"</p> <p>"Just the usual, but... well, when I heard you say that you would love to have a drink with me, it wasn't a question. Of course I'd love a drink. You're going to make me feel better about myself," I said.</p> <p>"How much, Kyle? I mean, if you can get it, we could go out. Wherever we go, we can hang out," she said.</p> <p>I looked her in the eye, "We can hang out; it's Friday night. There's no pressure, okay?"</p> <p>She laughed, "Oh, no pressure. We know each other, and that's a big step."</p> <p>We ended up in her car kissing before he got out and got us all a shot of the local bourbon and coke. We were talking as we walked to the door and I didn't really know how it went. I was drunk, too, but somehow I didn't get all the alcohol because I think I was feeling bad. We got the drinks and sat down to eat. She gave me that cute little pout, then she was about to say something and when she did, she smiled at me and asked, "And what did you want to say? Anything."</p> <p>I got all kinds of information from her. She was a pretty smart person. It was weird hearing she loved to dance, she was an artist, well, she knew a lot of people. She was going on a tour, making a lot of money. She was good at the business, she was the president. It wasn't too bad. She was single, she could move freely, she was fun to be around.</p> <p>"Um... how big did you like it?"</p> <p>"It's alright; he made it," she said.</p> <p>"You're a lot of fun being with him," I said.</p> <p>"Thank you, Kyle. I like being with you. It's really kind of nice," she said.</p> <p>"Well, I like being with you too," I said, "and it makes everything so much better. Besides, all in all, you're the best thing that's happened to me in a long time," I said.</p> <p>I didn't say anything else. We got back to the club and had a couple of shots of bourbon. He walked with her to the bar, she sat with him, they talked about everything. I got up and joined them; we sat at a table in the corner for a while, talking. I was having as much fun with them as I could. They were both so much fun. It wasn't too long before my stomach started feeling warm and I went over to my car to head home. I wasn't planning to get back out that way. I took a cab home to my empty apartment, threw all the things that I bought there when I went into it and walked back to my apartment.</p> <p>I went through my refrigerator and found a small box of cheese and pepperoni. I opened it, took a tiny bit out, and began to eat. It tasted good as it melted on my tongue and in my mouth. I kept looking at it, thinking that it must be perfect, but it tasted like strawberries. I was having a pretty good time, and now I was hungry, and I was glad I didn't have to go home for dinner. I could make some real food to go on tonight, but I wasn't going into town.</p> <p>It wasn't too long after I did that my next friend, Mike, was getting pretty loud; apparently this wasn't a good idea, but I wasn't going to be that bothered. Besides, I hadn't seen him in over a month, and I wasn't going to be in town.</p> <p>Mike was pretty good-looking, and really fun. Of course I wasn't exactly looking to be anywhere with Mike, but it wasn't like I wanted to. In fact, I was sort of hoping not to. It was my first time having friends over, and maybe it was because they were friends, but the atmosphere at the club was pretty nice. He knew all the places, but if you wanted something to drink, it was good to be at the right place.</p> <p>Just being with Mike didn't really seem so bad. Maybe he was more interested in watching me and doing whatever we could. Either way, I was starting to like it. The way he spoke, the way he talked, it was pretty funny. I found myself kind of enjoying myself, and the food was fantastic. He was talking about music, and he was talking about how good it was as he made drinks.</p> <p>That's when it turned into something I would not have thought I would have been interested in. Mike was a little shyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
