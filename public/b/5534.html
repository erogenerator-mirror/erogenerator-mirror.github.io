"I knew I'd do this." Slowly moving my hands up towards her chest, I brought our fingers together, and slid my hands inwards as they made their slow journey. The sensation was incredible. Her skin was soft and warm. I could smell more of her perfume as I moved upwards. I paused and brought my hands back down, and moved them down over her boobs, my fingers finding her nipples easily, and I squeezed them slightly. Their hardness surprised me, and I gave them some more massaging to make them more erect. She moaned a little, and moved her head back. I continued to slide my hands down, over her stomach and further down as it made it's way to her pussy. She was soaking wet. I could feel her hips moving under my fingertips. I knew she liked it, wanted me to stop, and I knew if she wanted me to continue she could. But I wasn't going to stop myself. I slid my hands upwards even further.</p> <p>"It's time," she said. But I was surprised when I felt my fingers touching her clit as it pressed against it as she moved her hips forward.</p> <p>"No," was all she said, and without warning she pushed one of my fingers into her. I could feel her getting wet around me and the finger inside her was very large, and it almost took my breath away, she was so big.</p> <p>"Stop," she said, and I could hear her breathing change dramatically as I slid my fingers out of her.</p> <p>"I need a minute," she said before she stood up and kissed me. We were still in each other's arms, and my fingers started to slide lower. I pushed my hand down between her legs and felt her opening as it was pushed open. I put the finger up against the lips of her pussy, opening them slightly, and I slid my finger gently back inside. I started to move it in and out slowly, gently, and she closed her eyes and moved her hips towards me.</p> <p>"Oh," she said, "oh." She opened her eyes a bit wider, and I could see she was looking down at me. I put my finger back in her, and pushed it up as far as it would go. She was wet, and the touch of my fingers sent thrills through me. She opened her eyes wider, and looked at me in the eyes, before she smiled and dropped her eyes back to mine. She slid her hands up over my breasts again and pushed them higher so her fingers could touch my nipples. I felt her move towards me and her fingers found my nipple, and she started to tease them. She put a single finger to each nipple before sliding it slowly up from my breasts to my breast, before returning each breast to my chest. She repeated this two more times, until I moaned in approval of what she was doing, and she lowered her other hand over my mouth and moved it down to my pussy, where she slid two of her fingers inside, and rubbed them along the lips as the third one found my clit, and started rubbing it.</p> <p>"Oh, Sarah," I moaned. "Oh, Sarah." I closed my eyes and tilted my head back as we felt my body start to quiver over her fingers. She kept working it out to give me the orgasm I wanted to get it over with. She slid her fingers from inside before bringing them to her mouth and sucking them off, before raising her hand to her mouth and licked all the juices from her fingers.</p> <p>"I'm exhausted," she said as she got up. "My boyfriend left me for two reasons, and I didn't want to get into trouble, but I wanted to give you a climax so we could sleep." She picked up her panties off the floor, and put them on. She turned around to look at herself in the mirror as it hung over the side of the bed.</p> <p>"You look like you came," she said, and winked at me. "I like the way my cum is all over." She looked at me, and smiled. "I came with you, it was awesome."</p> <p>I smiled back and looked at her, admiring the beauty that she had for me, before looking back to the mirror and saying, "I thought you'd like it."</p> <p>"I loved it, and it was so good, but now I would like anything better," she answered with enthusiasm. "Now we can be more passionate, too," she said with a laugh.</p> <p>"Yeah, definitely," I agreed.</p> <p>"I'm going to go put a bath on, okay?" she said, and went to put a bathrobe. I finished getting dressed, and gave her a few moments to get ready before she put on a robe. I didn't bother putting on any underwearâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
