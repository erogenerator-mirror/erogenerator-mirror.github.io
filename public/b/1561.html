I tried to talk her back to the truth by saying what she was thinking, how she came to be doing this.</p> <p>"You don't love me anymore, do you understand?" She asked in an exasperated tone.</p> <p>I shook my head no, but as I did she moved me to face her, so I could see her face.</p> <p>"I love you too, my sweet, but I don't want to hear about the sex. I want a chance to go forward. To see if I can make you laugh and smile and have fun. I am not sure if I can be good enough. I do love your eyes!"</p> <p>I watched her eyes as she spoke. I watched her make a face, like she was being very dramatic. But I could tell that it was more of a nervousness or fear, something more of an attempt to see if it was going to happen.</p> <p>Then I remember the "tongue?" That word.</p> <p>"How does it feel?" I looked at her as I asked. "What did I do that made you think that I wanted a lover?"</p> <p>"I do," she said. "It felt good, didn't it? I think I liked it. I have been thinking about it a lot, and it doesn't make anymore sense to me. But you were right."</p> <p>"Good!" I said as I watched her face. "You gave me a big new idea."</p> <p>"It was a nice one," she said smiling as she ran her fingers through her hair. "I was scared at first, afraid that I was leaving it behind."</p> <p>"I guess we'll find out a different word for you," I thought to myself, as I smiled.</p> <p>"Come on, I am ready. I want you."</p> <p>"What are you saying, if you feel safe around me, you want to be my lover for a long time."</p> <p>My heart went out to her, but for me the word "lover" wouldn't be a bad thing. I decided to be strong and not scare her away. So I kissed her, and then we went our ways.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>I met her that morning at work. She looked great, dressed in a blue dress, tied at the waist. The dress showed the curves of her figure, and it hugged well. I was a bit distracted by my thoughts about the time in the hotel room. I also remembered how excited I had been when she first came to me. I was thinking back to the image of her body in my mind. After watching her through the mirror, I could tell that she wasn't much to look at, but she had a great figure. She was tall, at five feet eleven inches, long dark hair, and a body that turned heads in a crowded office as she made her entrance.</p> <p>She was wearing a gray business suit so short, that it went past the curve of her butt. The skirt showed a lot of leg, and her blouse left one thing to worry about. We were a bit closer than she would like. She was in the same skirt, and she had the same heels which she always gave me to go with her short skirt.</p> <p>"Lenny!" she said as we walked into the office. I got up to hug her. This time we made a big connection that I could understand very well. I didn't see it as anything, I was in total control of her; if I took her to a different point of no return, I knew that I controlled her every move. Maybe there was a relationship here and now, but for now, we were happy.</p> <p>We talked about nothing in particular, just enjoyed the moment. I could tell that she had the same sense of what I had as her.</p> <p>"I'm going to go over a report," she said.</p> <p>"Okay!" I said, as my heart raced under her knowing fingers. "I'll tell you what's going to happen this afternoon, when I get back."</p> <p>"Will you call me? I could use a friend," she said, as she looked down shyly. "I'd love to come to your office tonight. How about after?" she asked, as she turned down a corner of the main office.</p> <p>"You don't have to do that," I laughed.</p> <p>At that exact moment, I called my boss. We were going to go to his office today. It was his office, and I knew my boss would be there. When we talked I assured her that it would be okay to take it.</p> <p>"We're at that, okay?" he said. "This could be tricky. I'm going to try and make you comfortable, but before going out on a limb, I need a look atâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
