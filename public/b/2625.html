He tried to get that out with something else, and managed to shake the image from his mind.</p> <p>Dara had the feeling that she was about to be seduced, and had her face right below his. She wasn't even pretending and she knew it. Sam's hips were bucking up.</p> <p>"Shit, Sam." She tried to keep it up as long as she could. It was like watching porn. His face was frozen as though it were waiting for something he wanted to do. He wasn't talking a word, and just had his eyes closed.</p> <p>Dara's body went limp. His voice was so soft it was like breathing through a thin film. She felt as if there was a weight off her back, and her body slowly turned to the side. Suddenly she felt a light slap on her cheek, and the door opened and closed again. The person was gone.</p> <p>Sam sat down on the couch next to Sam.</p> <p>"You said you were going to kill me. That's enough of that." Sam spoke through his confusion.</p> <p>"M-m-me, too," said Dara. She wanted that out.</p> <p>"But you made your promise, Dara. I know you want to do it, but you have to give yourself a little something."</p> <p>"Oh, yes, I will give myself to you in all of my holes." She said again. She leaned over him and kissed his chest lightly. He had a smirk on his face, and his eyes were still closed.</p> <p>"I don't want you to get the wrong idea about what I'm about to do if this is what I want."</p> <p>"Well, I'm glad you could take it, Sam." Dara smiled up at him. She was so pleased with herself that she didn't care what the answer was that first night. She wanted to experience herself, even if it was just once. "And just in case you can't find it on your own then you have to get down on your knees, and give it a try before it's too late."</p> <p>Sam laughed. Dara had on this tight short outfit that she liked to wear for herself but wasn't too interested in because she liked the feeling that when men got an eyeful of it, the more they liked. It was more than a little revealing, but it certainly didn't seem like a problem when she wanted to take off her tight fitting outfits, and Sam was getting off on that.</p> <p>"I've only just started, though," Sam said.</p> <p>"Oh, good. Then hurry up and do it." Dara reached down and felt around Sam's chest. "You do have some pretty big balls, aren't you?" She chuckled before she took his balls in her hand and slid them in her mouth.</p> <p>Sam couldn't tell if he liked that feeling or not, as she had his manhood right through his pants, and she had brought him off just by the idea. He couldn't feel his balls getting larger from this alone.</p> <p>"Gimme." Sam managed to say between licks that were more than just getting it done.</p> <p>"You can have my manhood if you want, I don't think I'm that good." Dara took his hand that was rubbing her stomach and began to kiss his way down his body. He felt himself become excited as soon as Dara got to him. She was still wearing her clothes, but there was no way that she could get naked in the next room. It was just too good, she thought.</p> <p>Sam wanted to take off his pants, but there wasn't nearly enough to undo, and was just too distracted that if he did, he wouldn't be able to do it. The idea just made him more excited.</p> <p>After what seemed like forever and a full-length look around his apartment with her kneeling astride the couch right in front of him, Dara stood up and slowly pulled down her shirt. Once she got it off, she kicked it aside and dropped her jeans so that they fell to the floor. Sam could smell Dara's sex. It smelled sweet and sexy, and Sam wanted to smell her right now.</p> <p>"Oh, shit, Sam!" He was too distracted by these two sexiest vixens to do anything, and just stood there as Dara stepped out of them. She was standing with one ankle up on the couch, and her hand had slipped into her panties. She pulled them off, and her hand went up her leg to the spot between her legs. Her other hand was busy taking some skin off Dara's other big tit into her mouth before she'd finished. In the meantime, Dara had pulled out of her panties and thrown them intoâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
