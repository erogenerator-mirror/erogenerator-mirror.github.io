The next morning, the date got off and we decided to go down to the beach on Saturday morning. The beach was so small that we ended up at one of the pools. The day was gorgeous with the moon, the sun, the wind, everything just made a day to be memorable. We got a decent sized sun table out and sat at the pool and ate our brunch. Then on our way to the pool, our dates went home to their parents. We left them for a while for the weekend.</p> <p>One Saturday, a couple of years later, the beach was packed with the two couples from our lives. We had dinner together at a local inn and talked about getting back to our jobs and starting over. It became apparent that we both wanted to find a permanent job that would pay enough so that we could stay in our apartments and just work. We both agreed to make the offer from Saturday morning. We left at five a.m. to go back home. On the way back, we saw some of our friends still around and invited some of them to come by the apartment and get some lunch. I took it as a thank you.</p> <p>We sat on the beach making our plans for the week while we were waiting for the day to end. I told my roommate to stay with his girlfriend until I got off work that Monday and we were to stay at her apartment that Saturday night. Of course, she agreed and then we talked about my future. We would take off in two months and go on our own then work our way back. We made plans for the rest of our lives and planned to be back to our jobs at the same time. We decided to go for it.</p> <p>I still couldn't get the thought of seeing my two best friends all together away from me. So I had taken my girlfriend to a movie to celebrate our breakup, I had to go pick her up and we were home alone. Our dates were scheduled to be at my work the next night. I was just going to come home and meet her and get off work the next day. I decided to pick her up on the way, which surprised the hell out of me.</p> <p>I walked her over to her apartment and pulled up my car and drove her to her building. It was a nice apartment that was on the 5th floor, not that I ever lived in town and with the commute, I didn't want to be driving again, but I had enough cash to pay for most of my apartment. Once we got there, she seemed like she was glad to go on the first visit so that we could do the dishes and get ready for our date. Her friend, Cindy, came over to the apartment when I got home.</p> <p>"I've missed this place" she said and we just turned and walked to her building. We got to her building just after ten and just walked by her door and there was a good spot right near her apartment. We walked in hand in hand to her door when she knocked. We walked inside and we went straight to her couch. I couldn't help but notice that she wasn't wearing a top so I put my hand on her bare stomach. I kissed her, our tongues met and we kissed gently for only a short instant. I pulled away and asked her if she wanted me to fuck her. She knew what to do so she just stood up and undid the buttons on her shorts. I had one hand to pull them down her legs so that I could remove her panties. She stopped me by pulling them completely off and then stepped out of them. I was surprised by her total lack of pubic hair and that this was the first time I had done it since I could have fucked her. The sight of her neatly shaved cunt made my dick hard.</p> <p>She turned around slowly so I could eat her pussy. We went straight to her bed and I laid her down on her back. I pushed my cock into her cunt slowly. I fucked her slowly, but steadily.</p> <p>"Fuck me" she cried as she spread her legs wider for me.</p> <p>So I plunged my cock and pounded her cunt. I heard her moans and her cries as I drove her over the edge. We were getting closer to our orgasms and I told her that I wanted her to lick my cum off her tits. When I felt her tongue start to feel good, I told her I wanted her to suck my cock and get it good and hard. She leaned down to me and I put my hand over her big tits and pushed them together so I could fuck both nipples and give her a good cum sucking. She sucked and licked my cock and balls until my body was on the edge of eruption. She laid back and I fucked her harder and faster. Then after a few minutesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
