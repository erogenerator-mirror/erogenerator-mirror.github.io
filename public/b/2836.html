His hands reached out and pulled him onto the bed.</p> <p>"Ricky," said Sam, "you have done something to me and I don't know what it is.</p> <p>Sam kissed him on the lips. "My love, I love you. I have loved you, from the beginning and always will."</p> <p>"I know, you look so vulnerable right now. Your nipples are erect and standing at attention. You feel so vulnerable and aroused."</p> <p>"Touch me please," yelled Sam, "Please touch me."</p> <p>"Are you sure we have time to get you ready, Darling," asked Sam, "do you think you will be able to control yourself?"</p> <p>"I must, " was Sam's reply.</p> <p>"Now for the main event," said Sam, "I am now going to start your sexual release."</p> <p>Sam pulled Ricky to the bed and started to strip off his clothes. Sam reached out his hand and pulled up on Ricky's chest just as his hand came to rest on top of Ricky's erection. He held it up for Ricky's inspection. Sam was impressed that his hand was so firm and long. The foreskin was pulled up over the head and the shaft of what must be about six inches or so was at eye level to Ricky.</p> <p>Sam felt that he could still control Ricky's erection but Ricky's breathing was now erratic and his hands were sweating. "You are beautiful," whispered Sam.</p> <p>Ricky's breath started coming in gasps and he seemed to take every breath in.</p> <p>"Ricky," said Sam, "are you ready?"</p> <p>"Yes", groaned Ricky.</p> <p>Sam reached down and pulled at the belt loops of his robe. He pulled it up off him and off his body exposing his hard erection to the coolness of room air.</p> <p>Sam reached around and cupped Ricky's erection in his hand. He could feel his heart beat rapidly. He bent down to kiss the tip of Ricky's erection. "Do you want to feel me, darling," he asked, "or do you want to feel me?"</p> <p>"Please" moaned Ricky, "please let me feel you, my love."</p> <p>It was Sam's turn to be surprised at the boldness of Ricky. It was as though it was a question that had just been asked. Sam looked up at Ricky and saw that there was no hiding his arousal, either. He was staring at the tip of Ricky's erection. Sam stared longingly into Ricky's eyes and could feel himself moisten. He leaned forward to kiss the tip of Ricky's cock, then the underside, then the tip again. Sam kissed him lightly on the lips. Sam felt the shiver run through Ricky's body. His breath tasted sweet on Sam's lips but he did not respond.</p> <p>Sam had now stripped and was looking at the long hard penis that seemed so much larger than it had been the previous evening. There was a slight dampness on his skin.</p> <p>Sam took Ricky's hand and placed it on his erection. "There you are," he said, "is that for me?"</p> <p>Ricky nodded, "Yes, my love. It is beautiful."</p> <p>Sam leaned closer to Ricky and kissed him, "It is. It is gorgeous."</p> <p>Ricky's fingers touched Sam's erection. "May I touch."</p> <p>Sam bent down to Ricky's cock. His mouth came down to the tip of it. Sam kissed him gently while he played with the tip of Ricky's erection. Ricky was moaning from the excitement of Sam's touch.</p> <p>Ricky's fingers played with Sam's nipples, "Are you sure its okay, sweetheart?"</p> <p>Sam smiled at Ricky. "Yes, my darling. It feels wonderful."</p> <p>Ricky pulled Sam's mouth up to his and their lips found each other. They kissed with long and passionate kisses. They embraced and stroked each other's bodies with loving hands. Ricky began to move his hand under Sam's robe feeling the soft flesh of Ricky's erection.</p> <p>Ricky's fingers slid over Sam's belly.</p> <p>Sam turned toward Ricky and kissed him as he moved his hand down. With practiced hand movements Ricky was sliding Sam's robe from his body. His hand stroked his hardness as it slid from Sam's belly to his pubic hair.</p> <p>In a quick move Ricky had stripped his shorts off. He laid on his back in front of Sam. His erection stood proud. Sam stared at his erection.</p> <p>Sam's hand touched Ricky's penis and stroked it. "It is beautiful. " Sam watched as Sam's hand ran over his erection. He leaned forward and kissed Ricky full on the mouth while his hand stroked Ricky's erectionâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
