Maybe we'll do it again in the morning but don't you dare leave me unsatisfied."</p> <p>"Well, maybe next time and I'm sure if you're hot as I am just maybe I should take advantage of the fact that they were my sisters and not some one in particular."</p> <p>"How about we go out to supper? If Mom can take care of me then I'm OK with going out for a beer. Besides, it's not as if you can't cook, right?"</p> <p>"Of course not. Why do you think my Dad died?"</p> <p>"How stupid of him to think you're that stupid so soon. So you'll never be such an idiot, huh, Mom? I know how you feel. You'll never feel so happy with Dad."</p> <p>"But...he's dead," she said firmly. "I'm such a fool for thinking that if for no other reason than to have me. And since my father is such a great provider and person of my life, if he dies, I'm going to be so relieved."</p> <p>"Don't be angry with me," I told her. "I have no problem with what you say because I do mean it. And I love my sister. It won't be as bad in real life as I think it will be. I'll get you a bottle of water, and I'll get you some beer. You haven't had anything, so if you want it it'll be fine with me."</p> <p>She smiled and said, "I think I will, but maybe tomorrow I can make something for you."</p> <p>"I'm all yours, Mom, no matter what. And by the way, you look ravishing tonight. Don't forget to thank me for the beer. I'm sure you'll give me something to remember."</p> <p>My mother looked at me with a smirk. After that great night, the only thing she ever talked about was sexual stuff and she had nothing to be sorry for. If I ever really enjoyed it I wanted her to think about it. That's my mother; when we've got the beer I don't care. In fact, I'm sure it's her for once.</p> <p>Sitting on the couch, we cuddled and chatted while we drank our beer. Our talk gradually got to light philosophical and we began to talk about our future. We ended up talking about a lot of different things than just about my father. I found her a fascinating woman.</p> <p>"Mom, you're still young. When your dad died I felt my brother almost crushing on the inside of my head," I said. "How old are you?"</p> <p>She smiled at me and said, "Eighteen, so I'm old enough to feel responsible for my brother."</p> <p>"But he is your brother, isn't he?" I said.</p> <p>"He's always been my brother. He's the one who saved my life the other day."</p> <p>After another long silence, she asked, "You haven't slept in the same bed together?"</p> <p>I nodded and got up to go to the master bath.</p> <p>"Don't you dare!" she said sternly. "You can't sleep in the same bed!"</p> <p>Sitting across from me in the bath, she had her arms crossed over her body and was glaring sternly at me. "When I got home this morning you were crying. That's normal, I'm just as responsible as you are, but I think you do need to be more responsible for your own brother!"</p> <p>I walked out to the living room. Taking a seat on the couch beside her, I couldn't help but notice her big blue eyes and that lovely smile of hers. For one moment, I wondered if she'd do something to get my attention. But then again, as I thought about it, I found it extremely tempting.</p> <p>Sitting there in my room with my mother, I couldn't believe how quickly things had come to bed. My penis was stiff and straining against my boxers but when she spoke to me it was as if I were the only one in the room. "I know this is wrong, Donny. What if my brother had taken your mother there? In fact, your father has been helping us every night, so what's the harm in sleeping with you?"</p> <p>"It's not right, Mom. If I sleep there, it might be our secret."</p> <p>"A shame," she said, but instead of going back to the kitchen she stood up and turned around to face me. "Have you got any more questions for me before we sleep?"</p> <p>"No, Mom. I feel really good about what happened but... I guess it's just a little... I don't know what else to sayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
