I didn't know what to make of her, and she looked stunning in her white, scooped-neck blouse and black slacks. She looked sensational.</p> <p>"Do you know how I feel about you??" she asked.</p> <p>"What?" I replied, "I thought it was you."</p> <p>"You just came in and wanted to make a man feel good," she said.</p> <p>I looked to her. She had a huge grin over her lips and was obviously pleased I enjoyed it. I felt so turned on that I wanted to give in to her. There was no way she could resist.</p> <p>She took my hand and we headed inside. She made me walk around the room with her swaying hips.</p> <p>"Like it?" she asked.</p> <p>"It's beautiful," I responded, "Thank you."</p> <p>I had never been with a woman to whom I had previously made a commitment, but to her, I was just the same man that I had been before I met her. I was just her first time. I was already in my own world of bliss.</p> <p>She opened the sliding glass door that led out through the living room to the back of the house. She came out with her arms full of clothes. One was a yellow sweater, the other green blouse and slacks. Both were black and looked lovely on her. I had no idea if they were hers or if her lover, or should I tell her that it was her.</p> <p>"You look stunning," I said. I wanted so badly to feel her.</p> <p>"We'll have time to do something more," she said. "You have to be naked."</p> <p>I stepped around her. "I'll be naked."</p> <p>Her eyes never left my body as she walked to her bedroom, stopping at the window and looking out.</p> <p>"Do you have something like this, just in case you happen to get undressed?" she asked.</p> <p>I smiled. "You're all I've been thinking about, all I've had fantasied about."</p> <p>"I'd give anything to see you naked," she said.</p> <p>She was getting into her closet and pulling out a sheer black robe. It was all I could do to get her out of my head.</p> <p>"What do you think, baby," she said. "Would you take it off?"</p> <p>"Sure," I said. I quickly stripped from my clothes.</p> <p>She walked around her bed. She lay down beside me.</p> <p>"It's like being with my favorite toy," she said, "There's nothing I'd rather."</p> <p>She pushed me on my back. I felt her warm lips surround me there and her tongue immediately found my erect cock. I gasped when she took me in her throat again. She kept pulling on my hips, dragging my cock down her throat, pulling back so I could enjoy her talented mouth. My whole body began to arch towards her.</p> <p>"Oh god, baby," I moaned.</p> <p>I felt her fingers stroking my balls and stroking my ass hole. She teased my back entrance but I had no interest in anything more than what she had me doing. I let her do things and enjoy herself. I found my voice and pushed my body towards her more forcefully. She seemed to be enjoying it.</p> <p>"Mmm, you taste so good, baby," she cooed. I felt my legs beginning to tremble. This time, she was actually sucking on me. Her tongue was warm and wet, and as she licked it, I felt my body shudder. She knew what that meant.</p> <p>"Oh baby, I'm cumming!" I said, my voice echoing through her mouth.</p> <p>"Let it go, baby. Take me. I want to feel your cum fill me," she said, "I want to feel it in my belly."</p> <p>She had been teasing me, but I felt more than one orgasm approaching. I told her so.</p> <p>"Oh yes, I'm cumming!!" I almost shouted for her. In and of itself, it was not even close to my release. She knew it too.</p> <p>"Let it go in my mouth!" she said. This time, I felt the surge in my cock and the first waves of my cum hit her lips and tongue.</p> <p>"It's so thick! I can see when you cum in your belly. Now let it go in my pussy," she said.</p> <p>"Mmm, your pussy has such a wonderful shape. I could stay right here all night now if you wanted me to," I joked, "I don't get why you don't want to try it."</p> <p>"Don't worryâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
