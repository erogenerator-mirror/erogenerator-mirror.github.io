I mean it, and I have you too now, that's right. If I had the chance I would have said anything. It's a big part of this story too, it might not be the same as what I think and how I feel, but it's real. That's why I kept it from you." My thoughts are getting whiter and whiter.</p> <p>"So I would like to talk about what happened at the bookstore. I know you don't remember, but you'll be okay. Don't worry about it."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"Because we can't talk about that part of this. You will have to come to terms with it and just be here with me. I know your mind. You can look, say, and listen to me. You're free to do whatever you want. Just take in what I do."</p> <p>"The word is freedom for me? Is that what you mean? All you do is let me take your stuff off? No, no. Not the word, but me taking your stuff off. I don't want you to be ashamed of it. I think I have to say it, though. Just take it. I would love to give you the chance to do that." If it were me there I would take the chance.</p> <p>"You are talking to those people here, and here only you and this store."</p> <p>"I really think so. So I can try again... I mean, do you have someone?"</p> <p>"Yes, you have someone. I know that this is out of our control here, but I also know it comes with trust and love." That's what I want, and I'm going to try to do it. She has been a part of me before I was married. I think she will have to think of that.</p> <p>"Are you okay with that, and would you do it again tonight?"</p> <p>"Yes, of course I'm with you. I'm so glad we made the connection. I don't know. I'm scared of it, you know. Now I have to come to terms with it."</p> <p>"I know you will."</p> <p>I get to my car and drive home. I walk in the door and there she is now. She is sitting there on the couch. She smiles and says, "I'm going to go change, take a shower, and come back so I can tell you the whole story."</p> <p>"Do you want to go to dinner?"</p> <p>"Yes, I think I will make the reservation."</p> <p>"Okayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
