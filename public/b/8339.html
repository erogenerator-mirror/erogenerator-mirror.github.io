I could hear her getting out her keys and unlocking the door to let me in. I thought about telling her to sit while I cleaned but instead I sat quietly on the living room sofa. I could hear her humming under her breath and when she got out of the shower, as she did once in the bathroom, I saw her towel drop to the floor and saw her naked body. It was as if no towel existed. I kept my head back and just listened. When she got out of the shower, she was carrying two dishes. She looked completely stunning in white slacks and a blue blouse. I could not help but stare at her legs and she was not wearing a bra. I knew that if I were going to have sex, I would probably enjoy watching her and not being able to watch.</p> <p>Then I realized that I could see her panties, not an ass, instead a small pink landing strip. But at that time I was not thinking about that, I was just observing the view. I was mesmerized by the view. When she was finished, she started on her plate, she looked at me as I sat motionless in her living room and smiled. Then she turned and walked out to the kitchen and sat across from me. When she walked back in, I couldn't help but stare. She got a nice bottle of wine from the refrigerator. It was not anything that I had seen before, but the wine was a little sherry.</p> <p>"Well?" she said,</p> <p>"It's nothing to be alarmed about, you know." She leaned forward.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Don't think that I said you could touch my breasts, just pretend this is not real."</p> <p>"Oh, but you're not touching me."</p> <p>"Of course you are, aren't you?"</p> <p>"Yes." I nodded.</p> <p>"It's just that this has been a long time, isn't it?" She looked at me, almost like a teacher with the teacher-student roles. It was strange but not as bad as how I was feeling when she was sitting with other men, but she still didn't do this in front of me.</p> <p>I was a little unsure about what was going on, but then she leaned forward and took the wine from my lips.</p> <p>"So, would you want a little lesson in kissing."</p> <p>"No, not really" I said.</p> <p>"Okay, tell me."</p> <p>"It's just that..." my eyes kept looking to the floor. She stopped me with her finger then.</p> <p>"It's my job." She said with a smile.</p> <p>"You're on."</p> <p>After a long moment, she said, "What do you want to do?"</p> <p>"I've seen what you did in the shower." She looked at me, I got up and knelt in the middle of the living room.</p> <p>I was going to get up on my knees to tell her but her hand shot up to my head and held me down. "Kiss me." She said to me.</p> <p>She started to kiss me and moved to lick my face or my neck. As she did, she moved her hand and ran it over my breast and my nipple. I started to get up to her but she said, "No, it's not my first kiss. I'm not going to be happy about it."</p> <p>"Why are you going to be unhappy about it?" I asked.</p> <p>"Because you're the first to lick my pussy, besides which, I've already learned how to give a really good handjob. I didn't even know it at the time but I just did it. It wasn't so bad."</p> <p>I stood up suddenly. My hands went to her. I put one on her shoulder while the other went to her ass and started to pull her toward me.</p> <p>"If you do it, I'll try again tomorrow morning."</p> <p>"No don't do it." I said.</p> <p>I got down on my knees and said, "Maybe I'll go to sleep with you."</p> <p>She looked at me and laughed. "Yeah, you do that."</p> <p>"You want to suck my cock?"</p> <p>"No." she said.</p> <p>"Come here."</p> <p>She laid back on the sofa and I sat there.</p> <p>"I'm not going to do anything with you until you try." I said. She looked at me and smiled.</p> <p>"But if you don't want to, I won't stop until you say you want me."</p> <p>I looked at her. "But I do want to try." I said.</p> <p>"Then get down on the sofa."</p> <p>I got down on the bottom of the sofa. She got up.
