I said sadly.</p> <p>She smiled slightly, "I would always be glad to be alone with you," she whispered to me as she stepped off the bed; her breasts swaying gently, "Just let it go, my sweetie."</p> <p>I turned off the television, got a blanket to wrap around me, and we went into my room. I laid her on the covers. She turned to me, "I was planning on sleeping in the nude tomorrow."</p> <p>"I'm game if you are." I said as I slipped under the covers for her. She sat on my lap, put her arms around me, pressed her breasts into me, and looked me in the eye.</p> <p>She got up on her knees, straddling me, and slid off on top of me in a 69 position; pressing her face into my pussy, making me lick and taste myself. She licked my clit for a little while, but stopped and looked me straight in the eye again.</p> <p>"It has turned me on to watch you suck her pussy." She said, sounding a little unsure.</p> <p>"It's turning me on to see her taking you down on your knees and pushing you hard little ass until you have her screaming into your pussy, but she never begs you to stop." I replied and watched her tongue slide up and down my clit in long strokes. Her head was bobbing and pushing back-and-forth at a slow speed. The feeling was so intense. I grabbed her hips and tried to pull her harder into me, but her head moved to the other side, and she was off her game now. She looked me directly in the eye again, and the hunger in her eyes was intense, and she licked my lips and said, "That's right, baby. I'm going to take care of you; you're mine now."</p> <p>She got off of me, straddled my legs, and spread her thighs open. "Oh God, baby," she moaned as she grabbed my cock and rubbed it against her pussy, letting me slide easily inside to the hilt before she sat down on me again. She put her hands on my chest, her head resting on me again. She wrapped her legs around me, and started to move, grinding the full length of my cock in and out of herself, taking me almost right through her body.</p> <p>"Oh god, baby, don't... wait." she whispered into my ear. "I want you in me this time."</p> <p>She looked back at me, "I'll take that as one hundred percent." she said with a wink.</p> <p>I looked back at her and kissed her on the lips. "You can do better than that."</p> <p>She kissed me again "Maybe we will, sweetheart."</p> <p>She slowly slid up a bit, and ground her clit on mine. "Damn it, sweetie. You're not ready yet."</p> <p>Shit, I thought, I'm not ready yet. "I know about fucking, but I never have to, baby." She said as she put her head on my shoulder and looked into my eyes.</p> <p>"So what do you always want for me to say?"</p> <p>"I want you to always just say what you're thinking, right?" she asked as she started to move up and down on my cock. Her eyes were closed, and she was grinding me harder and harder in her wet pussy as I held her close.</p> <p>"And when?"</p> <p>"Whenever." she replied.</p> <p>I looked at her for a moment longer, then leaned over her, resting my head against the small of her back, and started kissing her neck. She started to cum soon after that, and I could feel her orgasm rolling up through her body, her pussy muscles contracted over and over with each spasm.</p> <p>"Shit," I thought to myself as her orgasm subsided.</p> <p>My sister finally pulled her face away from mine, and smiled at me, "You're going to have to go back to the way I started the night, okay?"</p> <p>"I know, but if I ever need you again," I whispered. She smiled back at me and kissed me gently. She got off of me, stood, and turned off the bedside light before putting on a robe for I don't know how long. I walked into the bathroom to clean myself up. She was in mine on the bottom side, standing in the doorway. She kissed me; I kissed her back, "You're my sister." We broke off the kiss just as the door opened and our parents walked in with their arms full of flowers.</p> <p>The next day was horrible, I could tell they would be gone by the end of the day when they came home.</p> <p>I got up early for work, as I had to runâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
