"Why hadn't you come to see me earlier?"</p> <p>She smiled. "Because I had so many questions, and I knew you would be here so I was surprised."</p> <p>"Is good," I replied, "for you."</p> <p>She laughed and rolled her eyes. "Good," I told her and gave the top of her head a quick rub, then continued toward the door. "See you at the airport."</p> <p>She rolled her eyes in response and looked back at the house to see if I was on the sidewalk.</p> <p>When I was in my car, I wondered what I had gotten myself into. I felt better in the darkness than I ever had before, I felt that much more relaxed. I had a job, a house I loved, a wife I loved, a wife who could cook. But I had never felt this way about anyone before in my entire life, no one, from afar, even a woman could ever tell that my love for her was just lustful lust. It was almost as if I was falling for her too, no longer the perfect husband and wife.</p> <p>At the airport, I spent the entire flight wondering what all this was all about. I arrived in a large waiting area with people waiting to board and people getting their baggage. There weren't any visible cars in sight, no one seemed to see the plane pull out, there were no people walking to the baggage pickers and there was none. The plane seemed to be going slowly, not being rushed as it seemed. It took maybe only thirty seconds, but it was surely close to half an hour.</p> <p>"Can't get enough," I said to my wife as I saw her looking up at me and smiled.</p> <p>"Yes," she replied and kissed my cheek, then got comfortable on her seat and began to tell me about her day.</p> <p>I began by taking notes while looking at the list but then took a closer look at the picture we had been waiting for. It showed the young couple just about 20 floors up who looked rather surprised when they saw the plane pull up. They were both wearing very short shorts, which I assumed meant something more to the plane. They both had baggy shirts and I assumed they were all about the same size. The girls on the other hand had smallish breasts, obviously barely large enough to contain those beauties but still very beautiful.</p> <p>Once I finished our story, as I was trying to pay attention with a laptop screen, I noticed something else. I began to feel a sort of sadness over the fact that it was me that was driving this plane.</p> <p>"What is it?" I asked, "I thought it was you."</p> <p>"I don't know for sure, but I think you are right," she replied. She took a small book off her desk and began to examine the pages.</p> <p>It turned out to be a book about the birds and trees in the wilderness. It described the history of the area surrounding a small lake, which wasn't exactly what we were looking for but I was glad. I took several pictures and felt more alone.</p> <p>When I stopped, she looked at me curiously. "Is there some sort of connection between me and the pictures?" she asked.</p> <p>"No, there isn't," I replied, "they're just some of the details."</p> <p>"That is so strange," she said, taking a second book out of the desk drawer and putting it in her handbag. "It's just like I know there is a connection between me and the birds and the trees."</p> <p>"Well," I said, "You look very familiar."</p> <p>She looked at me with a strange face. "I don't. This is pretty much the way I met you. I don't know when, but it has been a while. I never got to meet you. I have heard so much from you."</p> <p>"I can tell that," I said and looked back at the book as she looked at it.</p> <p>"I'll just let you read it for now," she said. "If you don't like it, you can leave it and the pictures alone."</p> <p>"Yeah, sure," I replied.</p> <p>"I'm sure you have much to learn."</p> <p>She smiled and picked up the book. It was about a woman who was a member of the local hiking group; she had been hiking to the top of a mountain range before I arrived. She had a small backpack with a small flat, blue backpack with long white legs and a dark blue hiking skirt. On both legs, she had a hiking stick. She had obviously been hiking for quite some time.</p> <p>"Do you mean thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
