I thought she might cry again, but she wasn't quite able to speak. She was looking at me and seemed a bit uncomfortable. It was a strange feeling as though I was somehow in command of this situation. I also felt I needed to make sure she understood, that I was in control. I was enjoying having her as I was.</p> <p>"Well, I'm sure I won't disappoint you," I said sternly. "Go through to the window and stand on all fours like a good little girl."</p> <p>She did as she was told, but was startled to see a woman standing there. She looked at me as though I had spoken a stranger's language then turned and slowly walked over to her. I moved on behind her, but made sure she would keep her mouth closed. I wanted to see if I would get the woman to do something for me in return. I looked back just in time to see her face blushing slightly, and then quickly straightened back up. She still had her eye-lock on me, although her eyes seemed to be flitting back and forth between me and my watch. I stood there not making sure she knew whose watch I was. I did get my answer though.</p> <p>"Bag that bag on your back," I said, motioning her in the direction of the bag.</p> <p>She looked at the bag again and then, obviously, at me.</p> <p>"You don't have to, but I'll put this on you. Just walk straight towards the car, okay?" I smiled to reassure her I thought it might actually work, but then she looked back at me.</p> <p>"Yes I agree," she replied, sounding as though that might have been some sort of a given.</p> <p>I waited a moment - no doubt to make sure we were finished, but then took the bag from her. I stood back and watched her, as she slowly did a slow spin in front of me, still holding her mouth closed. Eventually she lifted her eye-lock in that she had held for me, and I smiled and stood silently.</p> <p>"Now, how about I just leave you alone now. Go on past the car."</p> <p>She walked quickly off towards the car, not bothering to let go of her mouth as she passed through to it. I walked round to the other end of the car, and waited. I could clearly see her walking slowly towards it, and had a great view of her ass, which was taut and beautiful. I looked back at the bag to find it missing. I turned back to her and smiled.</p> <p>"I think you'll find there are no panties here, and no pantyhose. It's only the suspenders," I murmured.</p> <p>She froze, and looked at me, and for a second it was as though she didn't know what to say. Eventually she began to speak, though not very forcefully.</p> <p>"Please sir," she said with a look of apprehension on her face, and even softer when I saw her take a trembling breath. "I don't think we can go that far."</p> <p>I looked back to her in what I thought I might like to call a sexual appraisal, but decided I would just go with the feelings from now on, and do what I would want to do from now on. I looked back and forth between her and the bag, and from the bag I gathered she had a small cotton, almost see-through, pantyhose to keep up with and not a single pair of knickers. She was so nervous that she looked as though she may have been about to fall of one of the carriages. I smiled.</p> <p>"Don't worry little one," I said, and then leaned over and whispered in her ear. "Nothing will happen. We'll be back quickly. You just need to come with me."</p> <p>I left her standing there, frozen as I looked at her and smiled. I was aware of the fact that although she may have been nervous about anything, now she was nervous and perhaps a little scared of what was to become of them. For a moment I imagined that all she was really going to do for me, or for me - as an employee and anything else I thought I might like. The prospect alone had almost made me cum. I was surprised at myself for being so aroused so quickly at the moment, but then I was even more aroused as I wondered if her feelings were as powerful as mine were. I wondered again whether I might have to find out more.</p> <p>I got in the taxi, and when the engineâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
