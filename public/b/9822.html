Do you love him too?" asked her mother. They both turned to see what the answer to those questions was now, but she didn't really need to hear them to know what she felt.</p> <p>"Mama, I love him! So much it hurts me! Do you know that?" she asked again.</p> <p>"Oh yes, we could be in a world where we're not in love with each other. We get what we want here every day," replied her mother. Her mother's words were sounding a little more like a conversation than a simple question.</p> <p>"We have to get a name now, then we'll know what it is," whispered Melissa, suddenly feeling a bit of nervous. "I can't."</p> <p>"Why not," suggested her father. "That's the first thing we'll have to change your mind about."</p> <p>"What? How?"</p> <p>"If something happens in our relationship or the way we have been going for so long, there's no going back. That's why we need you now," explained Melissa as she took a step back.</p> <p>The woman smiled at her daughter. "Oh, you've got to be kidding. The boy won't have anything to do with us. Maybe with the way we're feeling. But we're just as committed to each other as you are to us."</p> <p>"I don't doubt it, but I'll take care of it," said Melissa, putting her mother at ease. The two women now had two choices - either accept what they feel is true and accept the feelings it brought them or fight or just be indifferent to the fact it has happened so long. The first choice was to accept whatever relationship they had once had.</p> <p>And though she didn't really see it that way, there was no other choice. In their current relationship, she loved her mother so much that it took more than her relationship with her father to make the second choice - she loved her dad too. She'd even cried enough to know her dad was happy. And in their current relationship with each other, she had loved him so much that she loved him even more. And if it was her choice, she'd want to be with him whenever she wanted or with whoever she wanted whenever that's where she felt happy.</p> <p>Her father wasn't a saint by any stretch of the imagination; he was also certainly not a saint either. But he also enjoyed her mother's company much as her mother liked what happened in each of their lives. She knew their relationship was more special. She hadn't even felt jealous of her mother. When she saw her mother watching as she walked around the house, or walking around the house, she thought she was a happy woman. But she also thought her mother wouldn't be happy seeing you walking around, or even to seeing you in your clothes, so her mother never really wanted to see what was underneath your clothes.</p> <p>The second choice was to give Melissa's father, whom she loved enough to keep a secret and whom she adored too, a look that she'd never leave on him in any event. The fact that Melissa was willing to accept her father was also a factor. For the past two days, she had been going to the local women's shelter to visit the shelter ladies. The shelter ladies were always happy to help out the ladies and most of them never really did anything except keep their hands to themselves, especially on the male patients in the shelter.</p> <p>Because Melissa's second choice was only a matter of going through with it, she knew exactly what she was going to do. Her first question was if she could have her father.</p> <p>Her mother's words rang out. "We should go for a hike. Then make some food for dinner, and go hiking in the woods. In particular, we don't really want to be around people anymore. You and I will probably take a hike tomorrow. I'll just take Melissa to the shelter."</p> <p>"Mother," shouted Melissa. Her mother had never spoken quite this way before. "Mother!"</p> <p>Melissa wanted something in exchange for her father and didn't want to argue with her mother. "I wish I could be there with you, too," Melissa said to her mother. But her thoughts went back to the discussion she had the other day. The two young women were walking about a mile in front of her to talk to her dad. It had been a while since Melissa had spoken to that kind of talk - never with a female present.</p> <p>"We're not going far, you know," whispered Melissa. She wanted to take her father's arm and pull him out of the shelter and into town. She didn't want the whole town to see her. Instead she wished she would see her father. She wanted to kiss him... just once and hold his hands. She wanted to feel her father kiss herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
