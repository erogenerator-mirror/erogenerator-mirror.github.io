At that point, they could tell that everything was going well and they decided to take care of their business. They walked out the door, met their spouses and went back to their car.</p> <p>The drive back to home was almost silent. Even after all the talking they needed to discuss, they couldn't agree on where it went.</p> <p>On the drive back, they both began the process of deciding what to wear. First, they decided on the simple white and black dress that they had never seen and then they both tried on their chosen dress.</p> <p>They both dressed themselves and looked at each other and decided to wear another pair of shoes that they had never seen before.</p> <p>As usual when they left the club, they stopped and asked a friend of hers to walk them to their car. They didn't know what to expect when they arrived back at home though, but there was none of the disappointment that the outside world would have expected when the two of them began to change their clothing. Neither of them had been to "the strip club" yet and they certainly didn't expect anything more!</p> <p>As they left the house, they were both breathing a little too heavily to drive and it was not hard to guess what was going to come between them. They decided to go to a friend of theirs’s house for some privacy.</p> <p>Once they were both inside the house, they sat down side by side on the couch while talking about the events of the evening and what to expect. However, they did not seem to be in a rush to discuss what they would do if they got caught by their housemates.</p> <p>They both had been waiting for this moment for a while and they had neither wanted that to happen when they got home tonight. However, in the meantime, they did not think it a very fair that they were going to get caught, especially when they still had no idea what was about to happen.</p> <p>When they had been talking a while and the two of them were already feeling a little bit of a nervousness, they became as comfortable as any couple could be, or at the very least comfortable enough to allow each other to get a feel for what they wanted to get to get.</p> <p>However, that was before the night began. They had discussed what to do for the sake of the relationship and neither one wanted to ruin it forever by pushing it further with each others clothes while they watched in silence. Finally, they both began to relax and realized that this was the time for them to start to feel a little more confident about what they had to say.</p> <p>They quickly started to kiss each other, and each seemed to have the same desire to be the first to start on the next part of the evening.</p> <p>It didn't take long to get her panties soaked with anticipation as she tried her best to get on the floor to give it to him with her tongue. They were already having trouble putting shoes on and even had problems putting them on straight, but the fact that she would know exactly what his cock was doing to her was something that they both took pride in.</p> <p>He reached his hand out and pulled open the back of her dress to see if he could see the red lace bra she wore beneath the dress. They both loved the sight of that beautiful lace and he felt his cock swelling even more. Their eyes locked as he brought his hand up and began to run his hand up and down her thigh as he continued kissing her.</p> <p>They were both already wet but he continued to explore the length of her lacy fabric, his finger still moving up and down her panty line while she pulled his hands toward her.</p> <p>In a matter of seconds they were both as damp as they had ever been. He reached down to hold the sides of her silk dress as they continued to kiss and began to slowly unbutton her dress and she pulled his hands away from her dress. When she had undone both of his shirt buttons and unbuttoned his trousers, she slid them down for him with her back to him.</p> <p>She pulled her dress off with her back as she sat on the couch. This time she held his head and pushed it down to her pussy as he began to lick at her. Both she and he knew that there would be much more to come if they were going to continue with what had been happening that day.</p> <p>They both wanted to explore each other the entire way through dinner, but then it turned into the best part.</p> <p>She pushed him back on the couch and climbed up on top over his body as they continued to kiss. His hands went to her hips and he pulled her down to his hips as she moved her lower body back and forth.</p> <p>They both liked where this was going, but were reluctant to have all of the things that they'd had done before be at a point in their lives when there was so much going on that they couldn—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
