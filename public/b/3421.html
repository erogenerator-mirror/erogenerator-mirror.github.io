"The more she likes it, the more she loves it."</p> <p>He watched as she began to squirm in response to his words. His smile grew broader as the situation became obvious to him; his hand had slipped underneath Melissa's sweater and his fingers were beginning to circle her right breast. She was still watching him with her gorgeous eyes as the feeling of her skin was still exciting her though. She hadn't heard him speak. So she just watched as his middle finger slid between Melissa's thick, erect breasts.</p> <p>"So did you like my little secret?" asked his words, his fingers continuing to tease her swollen nipples.</p> <p>"Oh yes! Thank you!" Melissa cooed as her body shuddered and twisted under his hand.</p> <p>"You look so good wearing it," he said as those same fingers continued to tease the nipples.</p> <p>"Oh yes, I like what you are doing to me," she admitted as her eyes again locked on his. She wanted to scream that she could do that at any moment. She didn't want to come so soon or make sure she was okay but she knew she would have to. This man had made her his, and she loved it.</p> <p>"Well I hope you are ready to make her come," he said as he pulled Melissa's breasts together with his palm. "Don't you have a condom?"</p> <p>"Of course," came the reply and Melissa had a fleeting fear that he was kidding as she was still covered up, having just sucked him off. If he knew that, surely she had a disease. She hoped that this man was about to take her from the waist down, to that very night. She wasn't sure what he was going to do until this evening, but she did trust him.</p> <p>He moved his wet hand to the small of her back and began to unbutton her shirt. He leaned forward to place his mouth next to her ear.</p> <p>"Are you ready to come, Melissa?" he whispered as she was about to say no when he began to pull her sweater downward, her soft, firm breasts exposed before him. "Tell me."</p> <p>"I don't think I can..." he continued to say.</p> <p>"Don't be silly, Melissa," he whispered. "I love what I am doing to you. You don't need me to tell you how to come, do you?"</p> <p>"No," she whispered as he pushed her sweater downward.</p> <p>Melissa knew the next question; the one of whether or not he was kidding. She looked over at him as the skirt was slowly slipping over her hips. "I don't know," she gasped as his hand went inside to cup her.</p> <p>"Melissa," he purred as he began to finger her. "Oh, that's feels so good. Touch me with yours. I can feel your warm body."</p> <p>Melissa moaned at the words as he spoke them and watched as her fingers trailed down to caress the soft skin around his shaft through his pants. Her fingers curled around his member and she began to caress him with a steady rhythm.</p> <p>He brought his hands up to push hers aside as they continued to move together. Her hand cupped around his, as if she were holding and caressing something else. He smiled as her nails traced down his chest, toying with his nipples. His hand kept moving against her body as he continued to talk dirty to her.</p> <p>"I love seeing you naked, Melissa, that's it. You don't have any protection. You will get pregnant. Please don't wear a condom."</p> <p>Melissa shook her face as she felt her body responding to his words, so much so that she wanted him to stop but couldn't help herself. It was like he was telling her that he loved her and that she did anything he wanted. She wanted him to get his cock inside her, so she pushed back her hips, grinding against him.</p> <p>"I want to see you come for me. I want to see you come. I love touching you, Melissa. I want to give you pleasure, too."</p> <p>Melissa was lost in the feel of his words, his hands, her body and his touch. Every stroke of his fingers was the most powerful orgasm she had ever had as her body shook and twitched under his caresses.</p> <p>Her whole body was now aflame with wanton feeling. Her body was still so sensitive that it was all she could do not to let her hands drop to her crotch as she watched himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
