It's way too rough on my feet."</p> <p>"I promise you that you're safe there, but just remember that you'll be back here again if things get to heavy."</p> <p>Tina felt better about being home soon, although her fear was quickly pushed aside when her heart rate had dropped off. She'd never been to the restroom, and to think she was ready to escape in the wee hours. All she could think of was her little adventure through the snow.</p> <p>"I should get back." She whispered as the door shut and she drove away.</p> <p>She'd been to the restroom a hundred times before and never really felt the need to. Now, with all she had on was her hoodie and her shoes, she had no excuse not to come back. She reached back behind her and fumbled for her keys as she headed back toward the door. This time she knew she'd have to wait for Tina. But what harm was it if she was right where she was? And if all else failed, at least the cold would start to recede from her body once the snow started getting to her. She got to her house, unlocked the door without knocking, and walked into her own small and very nice home. No one was home and she wasn't sure how long she'd spent waiting in the cold. She was pretty sure she would have to wait by the sink until she remembered what the place looked like once the snow started coming down on the pavement.</p> <p>"Oh, my God!" she exclaimed, nearly sprinting to her own bedroom. She flung her arms open and the cold slammed into her body. "Tina, we've got to get out of here. You can't go through this."</p> <p>She looked around her room. It wasn't the best place to live, but it was clean. It had a full bath and had a large mirror on the side with her reflection. The dresser and the mirror were scattered around, but looked pretty much the same as she had remembered it on the day of her fall from the truck in which she'd been a victim.</p> <p>She leaned on one of the countertops and pulled her head back and looked at herself in the mirror. She couldn't believe what she saw. She was a pretty girl. Standing there in the front mirror, totally naked save for a small pair of panties, looking completely unconcerned at all her exposed self. And then she saw the rest of her. Standing right in front of her was a very large woman. She was a blond with a very small, almost boyish, figure. The woman's upper body was covered with a white fur suit, and even though she was taller than herself, her breasts still stuck out a little. She was wearing a black bow with the bow tied in another bow. The bow had what looked like a looped leather belt tied around the back of the bow. It only held about six inches off her upper thigh, and then held a looped length of leather through the same loop as the bow.</p> <p>The woman's face was even smaller than Tina looked, but it looked a little more like she was in pain or maybe just tired or maybe both. She wore a black leather mini-skirt that ended at her crotch, that stopped just below her knees. Her long legs and muscular calves were covered in a black silk thong that only covered her panties. It was very small, as it was tight enough, but it made her legs look even longer than normal, and it was clear she was wearing hose.</p> <p>Her right leg was the one with the loop tied to a bow. It had a looped looped loop in it for her left leg, and it was as wide as she remembered it being. She noticed that she was wearing a sheer pink thong, also a little white, and that her pubic hair was partially obscured by the sheer part in the rear of her panties. While she did notice that, she didn't forget she was a short person and her legs were long enough, and not too long, to give her even longer legs. But her ass was still well off her small tight ass. She was also wearing a pair of black latex gloves that had two red leather strips connected to rings on the ends of them. She was obviously working out to keep her body in shape for a very long time.</p> <p>She looked down at her long straight legs and saw that she was about to see the very noticeable amount of hair on these legs.</p> <p>She reached out a quick hand to her stomach, and then slipped over the woman's breasts that hung down very low onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
