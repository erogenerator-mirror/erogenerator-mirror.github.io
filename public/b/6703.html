Now what's going on?"</p> <p>"Come take a leak. I'll be quick."</p> <p>Sheliae went into the bathroom and I followed. She went into the toilet, washed her hands and she gave herself a quick wipe. Then her back came into view as she turned on the water. She was wearing a grey top with a tight bottom, barely able to contain her magnificent breasts. It was a tight top but the thin fabric was not that thin. It would have to be careful as if it were a woman's top, the front was barely covering her ample cleavage and its softness. She took a hand bag and a long mirror then she exited the stall.</p> <p>"This doesn't look so bad, how bout, take a walk before you get cold!"</p> <p>"Fine but there will be no cold! I just want to give the man a kiss before I leave here. He's very sweet!"</p> <p>"Thank you! So, are you coming along?"</p> <p>"Sure but I'm a bit nervous. What if he finds out?"</p> <p>"He's not so pretty, he can't hurt you."</p> <p>"If he wants me, he will! I'm sure, if I don't get him too aroused I'll probably get my hands on him!"</p> <p>"You will...! Now before he tries to take you, you'll let him!"</p> <p>"I will."</p> <p>"Then maybe you'll let him have a turn, can he?"</p> <p>I nodded.</p> <p>"Come on then, let's hurry."</p> <p>She took me by the handbag, leading me up the stairs. After a little help we got on a balcony and I opened her top. She was not wearing a bra as I had seen before but a little white string bikini. I felt myself growing, her boobs would look good in his hands even though she was very short. I took out a condom and slid it on, then knelt beside her. She was very gentle and patient as she opened her legs and I was just happy to be doing this once more. I kissed her crotch first, then the crotch. She was very wet indeed and before I put my tongue down she moaned.</p> <p>"Just... lick me there. It's okay if..."</p> <p>"No, don't."</p> <p>"Just... lick me there."</p> <p>"I don't want you to..."</p> <p>"Just make me happy here."</p> <p>"Not until you do you."</p> <p>"I don't understand why, after all, he's our lover from the moment we met, I thought I owed it to you!"</p> <p>"It's what you deserved."</p> <p>I worked my tongue up and down her wet slit, feeling her soft skin give way to my lips. I slid my tongue in and out of her, my nose pressing against her wet patch.</p> <p>"Oh yes that's nice!"</p> <p>She was rubbing her hands down my body and she started running them through my hair. I pushed my finger around that tiny spot between her slit and her anus and felt it contracting.</p> <p>"Ohhhh, it's okay. You know I'm not ready for you to take me, I want you in there now!"</p> <p>"No, not yet, I'll do it. It's OK."</p> <p>I took her clit between my teeth, she gasped at this first touch. I pulled on it while a bit of saliva dripped out of my mouth. I worked my finger around her anus, then inside, getting the little bit of information I wanted to glean from him. She seemed fascinated with it, so I pulled my finger out and looked up. He looked down on us.</p> <p>"What's all this?"</p> <p>"My boyfriend is going to do it and his tongue will taste different and it will be like a man's."</p> <p>I thought I detected a little smudge from the condom but I couldn't be sure. He hadn't said anything, I didn't need to ask. I didn't push too hard.</p> <p>I pulled my finger out of her rear and went back to work on her clit. She was quite tight, I worked on her for a while and then I brought my tongue out. She held my head to her as she moved in and out, her breathing short and loud. I found her spot and gave a slow lick around it, her head thrown back. Her body tensed from my tongue action and then I started to hum, her breath quickening along with her breaths.</p> <p>"I'm gonna make you come!"</p> <p>I worked one finger into herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
