It was like he was making me feel as much as he was making me feel. It just made me feel so feminine.</p> <p>"You're still the most beautiful woman I've ever seen," he said before he continued, his voice still husky with his lusty talk. "I still want to do something special for your birthday. You know that?" he said with a wink. I just stood there as we looked at each other.</p> <p>"Do you want to come over to my place right now?" I asked, unable to think of what he was going to do. It wasn't just for me, it was for him. I was ready to explode.</p> <p>"Do you want to come over or not?" he said with a grin. He knew I wanted to come over. I couldn't believe the excitement I was feeling. The anticipation of seeing his sexy black ass as he sat down on the couch was just too much for me. I stood there nervously. Finally, he took me by the hand and led me towards his bedroom.</p> <p>"I'll be right back," I said nervously and then quickly walked towards the bathroom. He followed me, his sexy, sexy, sexy, as he sat down on the other end of the couch and watched me. I was nervous and excited. This was our last chance.</p> <p>I turned to him and held his face, turning him to me. Our lips met and parted, my tongue sliding across his lips. I'm sure he noticed my surprise as we opened our mouths and our tongues quickly met. I can't recall ever being kissed like that. I held him tightly and pressed my warm, wet lips against his as I kissed him, our tongues battling each other. My hands slowly moved down his face, stopping just short of the zipper. I could still feel those muscular arms encircle me as our mouths opened.</p> <p>Slowly I moved my body lower until I could feel his throbbing, huge, black cock through his pants. It was big alright as it moved against my leg. I had to release more of my anticipation. He put his hands under my skirt and I felt him slide the wet material down my leg. He ran his fingertips over my soft skin, leaving a wet trail down behind me my pussy. With one hand, he gently pulled back on my skirt.</p> <p>"I still can't believe our anniversary," he said, his face breaking into a grin. "It looks like your birthday is coming up," he said as he held up his wet finger just inches from my pussy. It had already disappeared into my wet pussy. I could feel his thick fingers as he pushed them inside me until he got his finger all the way up to the second knuckle. His big black lips surrounded my pussy and then sucked on it, kissing it and tasting it.</p> <p>I couldn't believe it. I never knew he could smell and taste this amazing.</p> <p>"Do you want to taste my pussy?" I asked in my most sensual, slutty voice. I was so horny by now. I had never done anything with a black man before. I was so ready and turned on.</p> <p>I could feel his finger slowly moving in and out of my pussy. I felt it slowly slip in and out of my pussy in one long, slow, purposeful motion. At the same time, he had one of his hands holding my thigh on my soft, sexy thigh as he pulled slightly away from my warm and wet pussy. He slowly brought that big black finger up to my pussy on it's way up to my clit.</p> <p>I was so turned on and excited. I was breathing heavily and moaning. I needed to cum. I wanted his huge, large, black cock in my pussy. I needed his huge, black cock in me. I wanted him to make me cum. I needed him to fuck me.</p> <p>He looked up at me and smiled as he took his finger out of my pussy. "Not yet," he said as he pulled the wet finger to his lips and sucked on it. "I think you're ready for your present."</p> <p>He stood up, took his huge black cock in his hand and walked towards me. His huge, large, black cock only reaching my thighs. He took his pants off and threw them on the floor, revealing his huge, black, black cock. I had never seen a black cock and couldn't believe what he was about to put in my pussy.</p> <p>He put the head of his cock on my pussy and slowly pushed it in, watching my eyes as it slowly filled my pussy.
