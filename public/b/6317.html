I walked past the old boat with the old house, the old boat that I had built from the wall, the boat that I had once built to sell it back into and finally the boat that no one could possibly build much less pick it up and haul it back into the old, shoddy state of Maine.</p> <p>The cabin had a nice view out over the bay, and a nice view of the mountains beyond. After a couple of minutes, I remembered the old cabin, and the view it gave me, and I had to make myself stop by that cabin for a quick rinse.</p> <p>Just then, the voice of the voice from the porch said "Hi, guys."</p> <p>There were three of us in the boat, one of which was a man about forty years old.</p> <p>The man came out of the cabin and said "We got a real surprise for you tonight." Then he said "Hi, I'm Ed. We heard from your aunt and Uncle John. We were worried sick and thought you might have run off with the guy that she was dating. We couldn't believe your luck. But I'm glad you took the boat to find her. And I'll take her back to meet her folks and we can go out tonight. I have all the groceries.</p> <p>I guess my voice took a different tone than it did the first time. The man said "Honey, I'd like you to meet Ed and his uncle. They are the two that I married out on summer, out in the country. They are both from this boat. Just meet them when you get back. And I'm Ed's uncle."</p> <p>I looked away and said to the guy, "Sorry, but I think this is the boat we are going to meet Ed and his aunt and uncle. They have all the stuff I have planned for us. And the kids are all in there. Now get back to the boat and have a good time."</p> <p>That voice and the expression on Ed's face told me all I needed to know. Then the man said "It has been a while. Are you ready for a nice relaxing evening on a fishing boat. Do you come for a trip here?"</p> <p>"Of course, honey," I said. "That's what they call it here at the old farm back in Maine."</p> <p>Then the man said "I have this wonderful surprise for you. When I told you that I knew you were into fishing, I wanted to go out on a boat with you, to meet some new friends. And I wanted to meet these folks in a special way. Now that we have met you, you can show them a place and time to come back here. And if you come back to us for a party, I'll let them pick you up afterwards."</p> <p>"I'm not sure what to do. They have invited us to a nice restaurant, but we don't really think of having supper here. It's a one-room cottage on a boat. So if you really want to do the right thing, well I'll take you home. But I don't know, what do you think?"</p> <p>"Sure. Why not. I'm sure we'll get a good time on a nice little boat out here on a nice warm summer day. There's no city in the country to see. It's a beautiful summer and a lovely day. So we will go out tomorrow. If we get the girls from the cabin, we can get a chance to cook something to eat on the boat."</p> <p>"That sounds great! I love the idea of your family coming for dinner."</p> <p>"Sure. I want it a nice dinner. I can't go with my niece out on a boat out there alone. She is such a beautiful young woman. Maybe you will take her with you. It might be nice for her to finally get off the boat and out into the countryside before the sun comes out. Let us go and eat something, then we will go back to the boat.</p> <p>"The other one is his niece and her old man," Ed added.</p> <p>"Who is this? I thought my wife and your old sister had moved along?"</p> <p>"I told you before, that I had been invited to join them for dinner. And I really hope you like the idea," Ed said.</p> <p>Now I was totally confused. I didn't know where this was all going. I looked at Ed and said "I'm not sure if it's really appropriate."</p> <p>"Oh, there's no need to decide," Ed said. "We can go to dinnerâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
