With the other hand, he lightly rubbed her outer lips with his fingertips. "You are beautiful, my little nymph." He continued to rub between her legs, and she moaned into his mouth as she tried desperately to keep control of herself.</p> <p>"Please...." she whispered, pulling away. He smiled and kissed her once harder, feeling her melt into him. He could have her body all night long. He pushed her legs apart with his feet and reached a hand down to stroke her wetness. Her pussy was dripping, and he used his fingertips to gently spread her lips open and touch her tiny bud.</p> <p>"AHH," she cried, holding his shoulders tightly. He continued his delicate caress, letting his fingertips gently stroke her sensitive skin. Her legs spread for him, and once again he could not resist her soft lips and inviting mouth. He pressed his tongue gently between them and felt her whole body shudder in his arms. He smiled as he took her into his arms and led her naked toward the bed that lay in his private room. She wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him to her.</p> <p>"Mmmm. It feels so good. I hope you can still find your way to the best parts..." She murmured as she slid her hands up his body. She wanted to have both of their bodies in front of the mirror to watch him as she took every inch of his anatomy into her hands and his head into her hands. "Please, yes, but right now, not here..."</p> <p>His smile turned into a scowl as he realized that she would not let him move. His mouth was still locked on hers, his entire body tensed for release, his heart racing so madly. He pulled away as if the sudden change of pace made him insane, and his hand was on her lips as if to stop her.</p> <p>"Don't... touch me. Let me go... right.... now..."</p> <p>She pulled her mouth away from his, and looked into his eyes. "You made me so hot, Mr. R. " She gave him a small smile and then kissed him again gently. "Did I make you so hot, Mr. R?"</p> <p>He smiled down at her, as he began to move a finger inside her. "Yes..."</p> <p>"Does that.... make you hard, Mr. R?" His tongue snaked into her mouth to play with hers.</p> <p>He laughed softly, and her eyes closed for a moment. "Oh, yes, please."</p> <p>"Mmmmm. Very good...." She slipped a finger between his lips. "You taste so good," she moaned. She reached down and began to stroke him again as he slid several fingers into her, causing her to gasp, "So, big... inside."</p> <p>He grinned and shook his head, "Nope," as he thrust his finger in and began to work her with his hand while he rubbed her with his tongue. "Tell me about this part of your life, too, Baby... I like all of you... I really do."</p> <p>After a moment's thought, she bit her lip. "I know why. It's the only way."</p> <p>"I love you, Love."</p> <p>"Please..."</p> <p>"Oh God, please, Love, love me. Tell me."</p> <p>She smiled at him and kissed him, feeling him begin to move in her. "Fuck me, Mr. R."</p> <p>His grin turned into the grin of a man dying of thirst as she rose up on her knees and slid one leg over his hips to straddle him. He began to kiss her again, their lips moving slowly as he pushed her closer to the bed. Finally, he could hold back no longer, and she felt his hands on her body. He was on top of her, pressing her into the mattress as he began to penetrate her once more. Her legs were spread for him, but she could feel him moving inside again.</p> <p>He slid in easily; she felt full. He was hard, and she felt him begin to pound her. Her hands began to slowly roam over his chest, and she felt the heat of his body on hers, feeling as though her own body belonged to this man.</p> <p>"Mr. R... yes...," she whispered in his ear as her fingertips ran over his heart. "It's like I can't live without you."</p> <p>"I can't say I'm not already... in love, Love." He held still for a moment, feeling the walls of her core stretch around his shaft as the sensations intensified. He began to pull back, and she arched her back so that he would penetrate her again.</p> <p>"Don't.... stop... mmmmm..." she groaned as he began to piston hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
