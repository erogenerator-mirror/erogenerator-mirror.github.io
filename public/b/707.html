I'm just a little older than you... I've been in lots of positions with lots of positions... all the time, anyway."</p> <p>"Ok... I'm not sure how to feel when I'm in that position," he replied, "but I don't mind at all. I like it, I like how it makes me feel, I like the way it feels. You sure did feel good in there... but I was afraid you'd find me to be a pain or something."</p> <p>My mouth fell open so I'd asked him the right thing. Of course I'd heard him say it again. "I'm not really sure... you're one of my teachers, that's for sure, but I feel that it's the right thing to do," I explained, "and if we're lucky, you might find someone you like, I know this may sound weird at first, but it's really important that we're both right here, with the light on, when we do it... in particular with you... and with the light on me, and... uh, what do you say, we turn on the light?"</p> <p>"I'd love to try it with you... but I'm sure I can think of a few reasons why not..."</p> <p>"Just don't... oh, well... just let me know... and I'll be in touch," I said, kissing him, and getting up.</p> <p>I was walking to my room when I heard the front door open. I looked at the clock on the wall and saw it was just after four and it wouldn't be long before I'd had my fill, so I had to get away from it. I hurried to the bedroom. I was not really able to stand up. After putting my gown on, I made my way to the hall way and started walking down the hall and out to the kitchen. Just as I saw my name starting to come up on the clock, the light went out.</p> <p>"Damn it" I thought, as I turned to face my door. I got my robe out of the closet and walked back to the bed. The light was still on, and I didn't dare look at it. My eyes were scanning over every available part of the room.</p> <p>There were two mirrors over the dining area on a wall, in each of which I could see the young man lying naked on the bed, and that part of my room was off to the side. It wasn't even really a bedroom. It was a room decorated with art, and it had a small sitting room area. I knew that the living room, the bedroom, and the kitchen would be at the wall, so as well as the bedroom area, there were a couple of other rooms to the side.</p> <p>I closed the door to my room behind me and began walking slowly down the steps into the hallway, but just before coming to the door that had the light on, I looked back in the small sitting area, which was probably as big as a living room, and the only other other room I could see was the one on the other side of the kitchen. I continued walking to the door and then the mirror again, and turned to see what I thought it that the light was coming from. It was indeed, though, just by the faint light from the window that seemed to be hanging over the room. I didn't realize that I was looking in to the right part of the living room, but then I realized, there was a very large mirror in the other room.</p> <p>"Holy crap, where am I? I didn't see this before... I know it's not supposed to... but... where am I? I'm the manager of this, and I'm getting paid to work here. I'm the manager! I'm a manager..." I let the words hang in the air, trying to control my emotions, and trying to take them down, but failing.</p> <p>I started to wonder though if I should go upstairs, but in my heart I knew I wouldn't risk being found out any more. Instead, I quietly walked to a different door and started to look in the other room. Then I stopped, and looked at it a minute. It was exactly what I thought it was: it was the bedroom.</p> <p>It was small, about a foot off a king size bed, but it had been placed right in front of the door. It had been made from silk silk which felt very comfortable on my naked body, but it was made of hard material, and when I looked at it the next day and it was a little too long, I had to check out another one. It was the only room I'd ever had in the house and it was a beautiful one. That was all I could think about before heading back to my room.</p> <p>But thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
