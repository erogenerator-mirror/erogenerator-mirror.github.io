I knocked on the door lightly and when there was no answer, I tried the peephole again. It opened to an attractive young woman wearing the black high cut panties and a loose top.</p> <p>"Are you Sarah?" I asked tentatively.</p> <p>"Yes, I'm Sarah. How may I help you?" she replied with a smile.</p> <p>"I was wondering if you remembered me but it's a long distance. What can I bring you home, and what can I buy to bring you home?" I said, trying to steer the conversation back to where it needed to be.</p> <p>"I've never heard of you coming home with us, I'd be glad to bring you along."</p> <p>"That would be great; please come on in. The door's locked, so please, enter, and stay in. I'll be finished in just a moment."</p> <p>I went up to the little door and rang the bell again. The door opened into a brightly lit and stylish den. There were four of them sitting at the kitchen table. Two were sitting on either side of each other. The third was on her left.</p> <p>"Ah, here you are. Who are they? Does everything here belong to you?"</p> <p>"No! I thought it belonged to me. I got it at the store, I didn't want this one to be left there!" I complained, as my mother came into the kitchen.</p> <p>"Well, if it's really you, you're welcome home any time. Now, get that suit off before you knock on this door again."</p> <p>I stripped and put on a white one-piece suit. "This is nice, I like it."</p> <p>"Sarah, I know this is strange. I was wondering. You told me to wait for a while and then ask you to come home. That was nice of you. But, you didn't call me, let's just wait."</p> <p>"This is how it works, remember," she said, as she smiled at me. "I don't have a husband or a boyfriend here, in fact, I am single and I am looking for something permanent with someone. And, you don't have to worry about a long, long visit just yet. You don't have to do anything, I promise."</p> <p>She looked at me lovingly and said, "This should be fun."</p> <p>"Sarah honey, we don't see the need to tell you what we plan or what we say behind closed doors."</p> <p>"You're right. Maybe we can set it up," she said with an amused smile.</p> <p>"We aren't here for you. You can call me if you change your mind again."</p> <p>"That's fine. Maybe you can give me a call sometime when the time comes. Why don't you get dressed and come out here. I will be right down."</p> <p>"Oh, you will; no, honey, do not come down, just go sit in the easy chair and I will sit down in the next chair across the table from you."</p> <p>When she came out, she sat in the third chair across from me. She had on a very revealing summer dress that was low cut, but just above the knee. She was still the only woman in the room. I took my time looking at her legs. They were shapely, long, and shapely. The color of her nipples was deep, very dark, surrounded by a lovely line pattern. What looked like red pubic hair had been pulled away to reveal the outer lips, slightly parted. Below that, the outer labia were pink. I looked up and could not believe my eyes.</p> <p>"I guess you like what you see. You don't have to be a lesbian to like what you see."</p> <p>"Sarah, you have beautiful legs. And your dress is pretty short. I mean, it's not like you are going to be wearing clothes around me any time. You should keep that dress on all day long."</p> <p>"Honey, you are being rude, I have not seen my panty hose yet today, but if you want to look at my legs for a minute or so maybe we are not the only people to look over here."</p> <p>"Sarah, there's no need to get aroused at any point. I already know what you are looking at. I have seen a couple with you in the stores. You are very nice looking."</p> <p>"And what about you?"</p> <p>"Oh, it's all yours; I was just admiring the way they fit and how they look. I don't know about other women, and I've just never had a lover like I have. But, I am just glad that you have been able to find someone to share your body, to be able to get your body likeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
