My knees grew weak as soon as his hand reached my pussy, so he slid one hand into the back of my panties and started kneading my ass.</p> <p>"Mmm, your hot little cunt smells delicious," he said in a low voice as he fingered my hole, a few seconds later I heard him groaning a deep, long moan.</p> <p>Looking up at him I saw he was fully erect and his penis was straining against his boxers and his balls were visibly bulging, his cock was so thick and long I could barely take my eyes off the length of it. I slowly took his hand and walked him to the kitchen and started to turn down the coffee but then remembered I had promised him something and he didn't want to leave it hanging, and I took his hand and led him back to the couch, his knees were shaking and he was breathing heavy, he tried to sit down but was getting so dizzy.</p> <p>I sat down beside him, he gave me a look like I was going to cry but I said, "Come here." Slowly he slid over to me, his erection was rock hard against my thigh, I spread my legs as he positioned his hands on my thighs, I slid my hand down his body and wrapped my fingers around his shaft, pulling him towards me.</p> <p>He groaned and I pulled him towards me, he sat there for a moment, leaning against the couch, his breathing coming more rapid but there was no need for my fingers to feel his heat.</p> <p>I guided him towards me, I was on my knees in front of him, his stiff cock was hanging in front of me but I wanted it in my mouth. The way he was leaning against the back of the couch I leaned over him, my mouth was level with his penis, my tongue flickered out, it was so stiff and hot against my tongue, I wanted no other sensations from my pussy than his penis head, his head pressed against my parted lips but his penis seemed to press further still. I pulled gently up and down his length, his thick head was coated with my saliva, my saliva made him glisten, he shivered.</p> <p>I released the head and looked up at him. He raised himself and I reached out and took his cock in my hand, it was so long, I could barely wrap my fingers around it! I began to stroke him, I leaned in as I did and our lips pressed together, his arms came round my back and his fingers entwined themselves in my long hair. I brought his organ to my lips again, gently, very slowly I kissed him, my tongue flicked against his tip at first, he groaned again, his body shivered as my lips pressed against his cock head, my hand stroked him slowly, at the same time I lifted my mouth and licked around the head of his organ.</p> <p>I pulled his penis from my lips and looked down at his eyes, "You taste sweet, I want this in my mouth. But first let me taste you." His eyes opened, his mouth formed an 'O' with a 'hmmm' sound, "You taste so good, your skin is amazing, I want more of you."</p> <p>I slowly, almost reverently, eased my body down until I was straddling his legs. I spread my legs, my pussy lips were a few millimetres away from his face, I felt his warmth against my pussy lips, I spread them a little wider before taking his head and parting my lips. I looked down at the glistening head of his penis, I was on the verge of giving him a hand job but didn't want to make a mess in front of him.</p> <p>I slowly lowered myself onto that beautiful shaft, his eyes stared straight at mine, he looked so good, I leaned forward and pressed my lips to his penis, feeling the head pressing against my lips, I parted my lips and then slowly slipped his penis further in until it came within inches of my throat. I felt his thickness as it rested in my oral cavity, I felt my throat being penetrated as his penis slid deep into it. My whole body shuddered in pleasure as his penis touched the opening to my vagina.</p> <p>I looked up at him as I sat on his lap, and then leaned forward, I placed one hand on each side of his head and gently started to slide my pussy down the shaft of his penis. He was so big, and his penis so thick I slid down him onto him effortlessly. His penis was very close to my vagina, I could feel how aroused he was, his pubic hair tickled all over my pubic area, the head of his penis rubbed against my lips and down my tummy and his pubic hair tickled my nipples. It felt so good to feel his penis press into me, I could almost feel him pressing against me, myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
