"Do that to me!"</p> <p>"No!" I moaned as my tongue worked the muscles of her throat.</p> <p>"Then kiss me," she moaned again. "Oh God I need that!"</p> <p>That's all I had to say as my lips and chin surrounded her neck and my tongue probed the soft and smooth skin at the base of the neck line.</p> <p>"That feels amazing!"</p> <p>For the first and only time in my life I had had one of those times. It had been a few years before we even got to try it when we were really in love. There were the occasional threesomes with the couple in our dorms back then and that was just part of our lovemaking, but I guess as things have progressed a little my lovemaking has come to an end.</p> <p>I pulled back, my mouth leaving a trail of saliva and her skin as I said, "That was amazing."</p> <p>"Mmmhmm. It felt even better after that. I had never experienced anything like that. I haven't had anything like what I just did with you."</p> <p>"Me neither," I added.</p> <p>"Are you ready to go again?"</p> <p>When it came it was always more like a second date, but this time I was really hungry.</p> <p>"Yeah. I want you to."</p> <p>"You want us to?"</p> <p>She looked a little shocked, but not surprised, "I have always wanted to be in a relationship with you. We used to be like that, just... together... but, well this is the first time I have ever done this to you."</p> <p>Her eyes opened a little bit and she didn't really look shocked, but there were a lot of tears in them. "You're the first person I've ever..." she looked down and started to cry.</p> <p>"I know!" I told her.</p> <p>"I really am glad. I feel so stupid for not knowing what the rest of the world thought. This is all so new and you know it. I've never been with anyone else in my life."</p> <p>"It's not your fault."</p> <p>"Really? It's not? And it's not what you think?"</p> <p>I thought about it a little. I had never been with anyone since we started. I couldn't explain, or even talk about it honestly.</p> <p>"I thought that's what this would be like. I didn't think about it, but that's how I feel about it. I know it's something that we are sharing, but it's not."</p> <p>"Really, you don't have to say that," I told her, "It's not a big deal,"</p> <p>"It's just me. I don't want to have to worry about other people. It's just not a big deal."</p> <p>I could tell that she really wanted to talk about it, but she was so wrapped up in it that I didn't really have a chance. I sat there for a second, and then said, "I still can't say anything."</p> <p>"No you can't," was all she said.</p> <p>We sat there for several minutes and then she said, "You know...."</p> <p>"Yeah, you know."</p> <p>She reached out and put her hand on my lap. "I don't know about you, but I really like this. It makes me feel good."</p> <p>"Me too."</p> <p>"I'm glad. I don't know how it would be different when we're in bed?"</p> <p>"It's probably better. We don't have to do anything."</p> <p>"We do! It's so special. Maybe we'll do it all the time," she giggled.</p> <p>"I know. There's nothing at stake here. You're my friend."</p> <p>"Okay. I love you."</p> <p>She turned on her side and pulled me on top of her in a very quick, passionate kiss.</p> <p>"I love you too!" she said as she hugged me tight around the neck. That was a first for me.</p> <p>I moved off of her and she turned at her side to look at me for a moment, then leaned back looking at me.</p> <p>"You made some really good decisions," she smiled. "When we went to the party I said I was sorry that I left you alone. You know me, I get like that. I don't want you to feel bad. I'd like to do something like that again, even if it's not going to be the last time we do it."</p> <p>"I'm glad you feel that way," I said. "Let's say for now, we can be friends."</p> <p>She reached over and stroked my face with one hand, "I love youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
