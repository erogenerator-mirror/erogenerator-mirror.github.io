Let me get these off now." I held them in my hand and she slipped the panties out of her pocket and held her hands up as she slowly lifted each foot out of them. I helped her remove the panties and tossed them into the wastebin before she pulled them up. I sat there staring at her, she was absolutely incredible. There wasn't a spot on her or her pussy that wasn't glistening from being waxed. Then she was right back at it again, I leaned forward and kissed her. Her knees came up to give me room for her and she let them. Our mouths met again and she was kissing me back very deep, her tongue was hot and hard against me and just like she did when we were younger we just sort of melted and explored each other the whole time. She grabbed at my cock and started stroking it while she kissed me and I could feel that I would come in a heartbeat again. Then she climbed on top of me and kissed me again and began rubbing her pussy against my cock.</p> <p>"Fuck me, I want your cock inside me." She was panting, "I want your cum inside me as hard as you can cum. Let me feel you cum inside me." Finally I did as I had been told and grabbed her around the waist and lifted her up and into me. I was as hard as I'd ever been, she started to cum as soon as we connected again, her thighs began to quiver around the one I had been using on her, her nails biting into my forearms. Just as she was about to fall off the plane I pulled her down again and lifted her onto me again. This time with the pillows under her tits and her ass in the air, I was thrusting my cock deep into her pussy.</p> <p>"I'm gonna cum! Fuck me harder, baby, I'm close, I'm almost there, god, I want you inside me!" she was panting and her body was shaking and she was shaking as my cock slid home again. She was so loud I wasn't sure she heard me and I was afraid to look over. I lifted her onto her hands and knees a bit and pounded her hard while I thrust my cock into her until I felt I would come again. She was cumming a second time and then I felt my cock spasm and begin pumping it into her body. I wasn't ready to stop just yet.</p> <p>"You came so hard, babe." I was kissing her ear, "Just like you had to, didn't you?"</p> <p>"OH MY GOD, FUCK ME. I feel your cum in me, I'm so full."</p> <p>"Is that what you were talking about when you felt that?"</p> <p>"OH GOD, YES." I was still panting hard and her hips were moving up and down on my cock as she came down on me and I could feel my cock swelling once again as I shot it into her and held it there as deep as I could get it. I leaned forward again and we held each other still as we both came down from our high. "Well," I said in that tone of voice I had that girls liked, "that was great. Next time I'll fuck you too."</p> <p>Chapter 5</p> <p>I woke up and rolled over to roll to the side of her and smiled, she looked up at me and smiled back. "Did you mean that?" she asked.</p> <p>"Absolutely."</p> <p>"I wish you could just go back to how you were, you mean it."</p> <p>She laughed and grabbed me and gave me a big hug. "Yeah, you know I do." She kissed me on the cheek and pulled me to her. "Can you pick me up at my place?"</p> <p>"Sure, you're up for any of what I'll set you up with?"</p> <p>"We'll talk about it."</p> <p>"I'll see you there." And we kissed like that for a minute and she kissed me again. "I think I'm going to have you over to my place tomorrow."</p> <p>"You're sure?" I had a knowing smile on my face.</p> <p>"I want you to want it too and I know you do."</p> <p>"It's true, you'll make a great bedmate." I had that mischievous grin on my face again. "But I wonder how you're going to sleep."</p> <p>"I can be a little bit better than I am with you." She was smiling at me and I guess that's pretty obvious.</p> <p>"There is one thing though." I was serious and she knew it.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I want to know about your wife."</p> <p>"I know and I think you're pretty smart, but are you sure you can ask her? I've got no idea what she thinks of you."</p> <p>"No, well, Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
