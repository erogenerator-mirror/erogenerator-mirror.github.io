She smiled at her mother and then took another sip of her drink.</p> <p>"Heh! I don't think I've ever had a glass, so nice! Thank you for asking me to go with him, but I was hoping to go with him, and I'm not sure about the other stuff." said Jen, as if she was really sorry for her mother's condition.</p> <p>"Oh I'm very happy for you Miss Jenkins. We would love for you go to the bar with him, if you like." said Jen, trying to sound upbeat.</p> <p>"Well, don't get me wrong, I might not do that. I really love his company, and I'll have to see where things go after."</p> <p>Jen continued to stare at her daughter with an uncharacteristic twinkle in her eyes. Jen finally broke the gaze, and laughed, and said. "No it isn't that. I mean, they're not my responsibility. They're just that! I just don't know what kind of an idea of a fun evening I can have, so that's it."</p> <p>Jen turned to her Mother again and said. "Come on! Come let's go with him."</p> <p>Jenny took another big gulp on her drink, and held still a moment longer, staring at her drink once again. Then she said to her mother. "Well, maybe you and I can go with Kevin while you two are driving him out to the park with him and your sister."</p> <p>Jen looked at her mother, and almost shook her head. 'So was I supposed to say no? But, I can do what I want to do!' she thought as she got up and gave her daughter a peck on the cheek.</p> <p>"Well, I'm sure Kevin would really enjoy himself with you. He's the sort of guy who enjoys it quite a bit, even if he does do it for himself sometimes. And of course, I haven't seen him in a while. It's not like I'm a very outgoing girl at all."</p> <p>Jen laughed, and said. "Well I'm certainly not your girl for that matter."</p> <p>After Jen had left the kitchen, and she and her mother sat down at the patio table to have a drink, Jen said. "Well, Mom, Kevin wasn't very friendly with me, and you know what? It really wasn't that I didn't like him. I can't really say much about my experiences with other men. But when I told you how badly I felt for him, I told you I was curious about what it would be like! He knew exactly how much I liked cock! He gave me what I wanted!"</p> <p>Jen laughed. "No, not at all. I know he didn't do much, except fuck me once in a while, and that is what got him. Now, I'm afraid we need to be careful about what he says to me. I'm afraid I've embarrassed him."</p> <p>"Don't worry Mom, he won't be embarrassed! He's just not as friendly as we have been. I like the fact you like the idea of us doing something fun and exciting with him, especially as you've talked about it. But maybe it's best not to say anything as that might be interpreted as an opening shot and I'll not press a bit. Just know that I like the idea of it, so don't change it, and please don't tell me that you wouldn't do it. Now that would be embarrassing, and I really didn't mean to say that!"</p> <p>"That would be true but I didn't mean to make any sexual innuendos or anything else. I just sort of liked the idea so much." Jen giggled as she spoke, and continued to look into her mother's glass. Then she continued. "So anyway, I'm about to leave for the park with Kevin and his family. And as I said, before I leave, I need to go and tell Kevin about what happened. I have a few more things I want to tell you about me, and if you would like to join me, I'd be happy to do that."</p> <p>Jenny's face lit up as she replied. "That would be great. I never would have thought about going with his family to any other place except with him." Then, she continued to watch her mother. "And what about you Mom? We can go and join the others sometime. Oh I know we can go to the park with you sometimes, but I just like being at home in the nude with you. I love doing things with you!"</p> <p>Jen smiled at her mother, and smiled down at her. "I don't like clothes on either. I like being naked with you. It has been a long time since I have felt like this withâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
