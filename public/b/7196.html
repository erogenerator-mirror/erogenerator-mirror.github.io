If you are ok with it, I need to know what a little cock makes." She smiled, looked down at me and said, "Ok. I think that we can do that."</p> <p>"What do you want me to do?" I said with a grin.</p> <p>"Don't think about that. Try to get me to do anything."</p> <p>"Ok," I said with a smile, "I will be there as soon as I am ready."</p> <p>I started to get up when she stopped me. "Please don't put on your shorts."</p> <p>"Ok," I said, smiling.</p> <p>She just smiled at that, and walked over to her suitcase and pulled out a pair of shorts and a t-shirt. I put my bikini on with a t-shirt but as I walked outside with her and she hugged me, I realized how long I had been standing there.</p> <p>"Let's just go out to the parking lot and run through the morning traffic. I'll help you pick out your car."</p> <p>I looked at her in the eye as we were on our way out. She was already turning on one engine and heading toward her gate and when she did I turned to her. "Where did you want me to take your car?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm not sure what you thought of me being on my own when we got to your car. I never went to the motel, but I am happy that you picked the one in town."</p> <p>"Just follow a little behind me while I set up," I laughed.</p> <p>We had just started to walk through the rain, when we heard a car horn and ran toward it without hesitation. She just turned the key off and smiled at me and said, "You should try the big truck."</p> <p>"I would love to take the big truck," I laughed.</p> <p>We were right behind her when she said, "I have just come off that hot shower, so you should give me yours." She got on her tiptoes and kissed me, then pulled away and looked at me and said, "We have to go. I want to walk around in there."</p> <p>"We are on the second floor," I said.</p> <p>"I am afraid so but I trust you." We ran down my porch and into the garage where my BMW was parked.</p> <p>"We are close to your house," I said looking at her.</p> <p>After we got in the car she got in my lap and we were talking as I told her the story of what happened with both of us and when I had finished it she went in the house as far as the bathroom. "You can stay there tomorrow," she said.</p> <p>"We can do that after we both showered. When did you finish?" I asked.</p> <p>"I did a lot of cleaning up."</p> <p>"How did you finish?"</p> <p>"It was really fun," and she started to drive. We drove for about twenty minutes before she pulled out. She was wearing her skirt again and it was short and had a nice little "v" in front that showed her legs.</p> <p>"What have we here?" she said smiling.</p> <p>"Oh god. There is going to be no sex this weekend," I laughed.</p> <p>"Oh I guess it is ok with you if I use the restroom and I will come and clean up." She said.</p> <p>She drove around and we washed up before getting out of the car. I dried her off as she was still in the car and had a nice smile on her face. When she put her skirt back on she stood up and pulled up her top and we went in the house.</p> <p>"I hope you had any lunch today. You can wait on the porch until you get the keys. It was fun."</p> <p>"Did you want lunch?" I asked.</p> <p>"Sure. Do you think it will be good for our company to have lunch with me while we are here?"</p> <p>"I don't know," I said, "I would have liked to see how that would work."</p> <p>We both laughed and she kissed me and kissed her blouse. "Why don't we get something to eat and we can eat after while we talk?"</p> <p>"I like talking too," I said.</p> <p>"I am not sure what is good and bad," sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
