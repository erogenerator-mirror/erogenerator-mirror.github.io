I told her.</p> <p>She sat on the edge of the bed and we all sat on the edge and she started to explain her fantasy.</p> <p>"You are to be my husband," she told me.</p> <p>"Does that mean you have permission to be with another man?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Yes," she said, "You know it happens to everyone. In my fantasies, I am to get raped, and then later a different man will be the only man you will ever have in your bed."</p> <p>"Would you like to go on a date? It is just us here, and if you have to, I won't stop you."</p> <p>"It is only for sex," she said. "I don't really like the idea of having a date. I hope not."</p> <p>"Well, what do you mean by 'have a date'?"</p> <p>"Oh no, I mean that we will have a sex date, but I don't want anything that we have not planned for. It may be a little awkward to be with a stranger."</p> <p>"It does seem like we are on the same page."</p> <p>I got up to my ankles for the first time as a couple." It was a lot better than the last time. I have never been a big fan of bondage so I started taking control and being the dominant one.</p> <p>"Can I just go with you tonight?" She asked.</p> <p>"I don't have another outfit," I told her, "If we get naked we don't need any toys, so no surprises."</p> <p>"And you can do anything you want with me?" she asked me.</p> <p>"That won't change, unless you prefer it."</p> <p>She got up and started to get out of the dresser. By the time she got it off of me and I got my jeans on and on the couch between me and her I was naked. She looked a little nervous so I took my shirt off as well. I watched her for a few moments as she got dressed.</p> <p>She came up behind me and hugged me for a few minutes. She got out her phone, and after a few pictures got a shot of me with her panties in place against my bare skin. It only took a few minutes before she was snapping away with a picture of my penis.</p> <p>"Can I use my phone for a picture or two?" She asked.</p> <p>"Both," I said, she was still with her panties, but she had removed them. She sat in the opposite side of the bed facing the camera and looked at me for a few moments as she took two pictures. The picture she took of me was one of her and I standing outside the door, and the picture of her leaning against the door jamb looked right at me as she turned the cell phone to face the door.</p> <p>"Ok, you can go. I want to get a lot more pictures of you, but let me think about letting you finish taking them."</p> <p>She smiled and got up to get dressed. She looked very sexy as she was trying to change into her panties again. She put her panties back on and turned around.</p> <p>"If you need anything, just give me a call," she said. The conversation was pretty generic so I was kind of surprised that she wanted the pictures. As she packed up the stuff she wanted for a surprise her phone rang.</p> <p>"Hello, it's my boyfriend."</p> <p>She put her phone away, and hung up.</p> <p>"I heard you two are going to be late, I am so nervous," was all she said as she put on her clothes back on.</p> <p>"I know, I have been waiting all day. Let's go get a movie," was my reply.</p> <p>"That sounds great. Do you have anything you think you'll need?" she asked me.</p> <p>"Sure, come on into the kitchen," I said as I followed her to the kitchen.</p> <p>After a couple of hours I felt like going to bed. I laid on my side watching the clock. 5:30. I didn't notice I had moved the pillows away from the head of the bed on my side.</p> <p>"It's about time. I need to take a nap. How about you?" I said.</p> <p>"Ok, we can keep the bed." She said.</p> <p>A few minutes later she was back lying in bed, but not looking at me. I stood up and walked over to her.</p> <p>"I have to pee," she said as sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
