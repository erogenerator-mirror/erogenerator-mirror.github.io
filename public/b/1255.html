"But why do you still want me to be?"</p> <p>"You're my friend," she said. "I'm not gonna run away again." They had kissed in the morning and he'd enjoyed it immensely. Now that she was gone, he wanted to do what had to be done. He leaned in to kiss her cheek again but she pulled away and said, "Not just go back into my bed."</p> <p>"I'm just not ready to leave," he said.</p> <p>"So, what are you doing right now instead of taking the next train to the next city to see if you can figure out what's going on with us," she said.</p> <p>"If you're sure you don't change your mind, I can take off," he said.</p> <p>"No, no no. It's just that it doesn't look that way. I feel different than I did the last time I saw you. I feel warm when you kiss me and you know I should be jealous. I'm getting cold feet if you don't want to do anything," she said.</p> <p>"Nah," he said. "It's nice to see you again. It was good for me too."</p> <p>They kissed and made out at the desk, then they got back into her bed when he asked her to.</p> <p>"So, tell me what it's like with you and my girlfriend."</p> <p>"I know you don't think I'm beautiful or sexy, but we'd be a lot closer that way, and if you're really happy to be with her, we could talk about it a lot."</p> <p>"It feels like we're never going to get back to what we were before."</p> <p>"That's true. I don't think you'll have any trouble getting over me," she said. "And before that, I'm thinking of having another lover while we're still together, and since you're already married, I'd like to find someone who is happy going forward."</p> <p>"So how are you planning to get back to your life?" he asked. "Is it going to be a 'quickie' or are you going to marry someone else?"</p> <p>"I'm not married. I'd rather be single," she said. "My boyfriend won't think that's cheating."</p> <p>"He'll think we're doing our wedding anniversary at one of our friend's houses or some other stupid wedding. Or worse," she added.</p> <p>"You won't regret it," she said. "You're gonna do it because you love me and want me to."</p> <p>"I do love you, Holly! And, to what purpose? I don't understand why some people are so sure of themselves." He sighed.</p> <p>"Because it's for them to have a choice," she said. "There are no others that make that choice." Then she leaned back on the bed.</p> <p>He turned out the light and she crawled into bed and wrapped her arms and legs around. They spooned until they fell asleepâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
