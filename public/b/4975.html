He did want to kiss her but that wouldn't have been right. She could tell what he wanted by the way he looked at her. But how did he know? How could something as simple as kissing someone as innocent as Sarah? It wasn't like she was someone he'd have sex with; what difference did it make when you were a guy but he was a man and she was his sister? Maybe it was wrong or something; maybe it just wasn't the time. It didn't help. She felt a little bit sorry for him and for that she was glad. She wished he hadn't said anything.</p> <p>"Come on, Sarah. I think you're beautiful and I just want to kiss you again." He smiled. "Now, you must be tired. You're still wearing the skirt. Get up here, we'll walk back."</p> <p>She followed him into the living room. She had no idea where they were going, she didn't even know their names. They must've decided right then that they were going to have sex that night. Maybe that was wrong, but Sarah didn't have an answer.</p> <p>"Take off your skirt, Sarah," his voice was soft and a little scary. She lifted her skirt up, baring her panties. "Kneel, Sarah. Spread your legs, and bring your foot forward so I can kiss you."</p> <p>Sarah was already bent over the couch, her skirt riding up. She didn't want to be naked but he still had a hold of her ankles. She brought her ankles up between his hands.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful," he said softly. "I like your hair," he added and started to pull the hair away. "I've never kissed a girl that long before. You must be a little sore. Let's get you good and wet." He began to kiss her neck and her earlobes.</p> <p>Sarah let him kiss and caress her every inch of her skin. She kept her legs as straight as possible and raised her ass slightly. She wanted him bad. She wanted to feel him enter her.</p> <p>"I love you," he whispered close to her ear as he kissed down her neck and onto her chest. His hands roamed her body until she felt his hands on her breasts. She shivered at his touch.</p> <p>She wanted it. He was making her feel wanted, and she was just going to let him make her do it! She had no choice.</p> <p>While he stroked and squeezed her breasts and nipples, one hand was playing with her slit and the other was cupping her ass. He squeezed the cheeks and her little bud and then dipped a finger into her pussy. She arched her back and moaned a little.</p> <p>"Is your pussy wet, my precious angel?" He asked.</p> <p>"Oh god," she managed to get out before he stopped suddenly. "Please not there."</p> <p>She couldn't have begged for more without begging, could she? But she didn't need him to say that, she had to feel him there.</p> <p>"You like that, don't you?" His finger slipped out so he could stroke her clitoris some more, then he began to circle it with his finger, slowly. "I can tell, Sarah. You're soaking wet." His tongue touched her inner thigh and she could feel his heat there. "Does that turn you on? Your clit is so hard and you want me inside you."</p> <p>Sarah moaned and reached down to press harder against his finger. Her breath was coming in short heavy gasps. She felt helpless. She hadn't been fucked since her boyfriend, her last boyfriend, had sent her home to her sister. He'd done that to her too. She couldn't let him do that to her. That wouldn't satisfy her. She had to take his hand, her head, or whatever it was. She had to know how long it would take him and she didn't want to disappoint him with her virginity as her boyfriend had done.</p> <p>"Let me," he said. "It's only a finger, Sarah. It won't hurt as much as what you did to me and it will feel much better when you take it slowly."</p> <p>Sarah was trembling by now. She wanted to let him and he wanted to let her. She knew she could take anything, she'd let him take her whenever he wanted. But she couldn't and he wouldn't let her take off her panties, not if she thought she was naked in front of him. Not while he was sitting on a couch kissing someone's mouth right in front of a man she barely knew, especially not when they're naked!</p> <p>"I'm not a complete idiot," he said, kissing all around her bellybutton. "All that I can think about is fucking you."</p> <p>His hand moved over her pussy more.
