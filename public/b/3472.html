She lay on top of him, kissing him passionately, their naked bodies touching gently, their breathing intermixed, their chests rising and falling with each of their hearts.</p> <p>She rolled her tongue in his mouth, and he responded eagerly, moaning as she stroked him. He cupped her face, his lips brushing hers, and he caressed her neck, his eyes still shut, his hand cupping her chin, running his fingers through it, his eyes shut.</p> <p>He broke away from her lips to look at her.</p> <p>'I'm glad you're feeling well this afternoon, and if you still felt as alive as you had that second time on the phone, and I've decided to continue doing this the next day, we can just do whatever we could to make each other happy.'</p> <p>He was quiet for a long while, and then said, 'Would you like to be my next customer?'</p> <p>She looked at him. He looked back, and saw an uncertain smile on her face.</p> <p>'I think I will,' she replied, 'but I will be happy to do it all day, with whoever you fancy.'</p> <p>'You have no idea, girl!'</p> <p>She giggled, and gave him another kiss, and then rolled off him and onto her elbow, then walked over to the open door, the room still dark, and opened the door.</p> <p>When she turned around, he was sitting up on the edge of the bed, and stood up. He took her into his arms and held her tightly. She felt the passion in his body, and her body responded, growing hard. Her breasts, now flattened against his chest, were pressed tightly to him, and she felt warm. She kissed him hungrily, letting herself be totally filled with energy, and his hands kneaded her back so that it hurt, then slipped down between their bodies. They were naked together now, and her arousal reached new heights.</p> <p>She kissed him again, tasting the saltiness of his skin as her tongue met his and stroked him gently. He slid down, and took one of her breasts in his palm, rubbing the firmness there and then pinching the hardening nipple gently. She moaned.</p> <p>He moved downwards, kissing her thigh, his tongue starting from the inside of it, leaving a glint of wetness on her skin. He worked her breasts with his hands, stroking her belly and thighs, then he kissed further down, taking her pussy between his lips. She sucked in her breath, and looked down at him, her face flushed and excited.</p> <p>He held her hips as he moved further between her legs. He was licking her juices, licking her pussy lips, tasting how sweet they were, her labia, her clit, sucking her juices. She moaned, her hips rising and fell as he teased her, rubbing against his face, tongue flicking her clit until she cried out with exquisite release.</p> <p>He stood on the floor between her legs, and held onto her by the hips to hold her in place while he sucked on her clit. He rubbed his hard cock against her pussy, making her even wetter with heat, until she shuddered in ecstasy and he came in her, thrusting in and out of her wetness. As he fell on the floor, she lay back, her eyes glowed, and with an expression of wonder, she held him close to her face, and they kissed again.</p> <p>'How was it?' she asked.</p> <p>'It was just what I wanted,' he replied.</p> <p>She smiled at him, and she was surprised at how easy that reply was. He just grinned back. They walked back to her, and he lay down on his back, his arm going straight to the front of her body - his thigh now on hers. She raised herself up on knees, her pussy hovering against his thigh. He cupped her asscheeks, and ran his fingers down the crack, then up, feeling the warm wetness and softness of her pussy. Her lips had parted and he kissed along her labia, tasting her juices, and gently sucking her clit, making her come again. When she came again, she lay down on him, spreading herself for him, feeling him inside her, feeling the warmth of his cock, throbbing and throbbing.</p> <p>'I'm sorry,' she murmured, 'it didn't hurt, did it? Or did it?.'</p> <p>He didn't answer her.
