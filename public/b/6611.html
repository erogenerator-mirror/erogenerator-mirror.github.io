His hands roamed across my body, one hand playing with my clit, as he played with my tits and nibbled my ear. I couldn't get enough of him as we kissed and caressed each other.</p> <p>"God, you know I love you too," he moaned as he squeezed and caressed my tits, then pushed his head between my legs. He licked and kissed me like an animal, his tongue driving me crazy with want.</p> <p>"God damn, he is good," I said as he pulled away, my eyes begging him for more.</p> <p>He kissed me slowly and with great anticipation, then slowly licked her pussy from clit to ass, which I thought I had never felt before. He took his time about it, wanting me to beg for more. The taste of her, of me, of my cunt, of my ass, of our lovemaking made me beg for more and more. He licked between the lips of her cunt and up and down again, making me tremble and quiver with arousal. After a few long licks and suck, I begged him to stick it in. God, I had never been so anxious to do something so erotic, to say the least.</p> <p>I had already been thinking about it since the restaurant. I was anxious to have him inside of me. He seemed so sweet when he ate me. I wondered if it was possible that he was ready for some more of his own. I watched him work on her and felt my loins swoon as he kissed and tasted her for the first time. We didn't hurry him, we both learned when it was required. He was a tender lover, never letting us know his hunger so easily. I couldn't believe how beautiful he was, and his patience in making love to my pussy. It was my most treasured gift to myself, as an art of lovemaking.</p> <p>I wanted him so totally as I sat there soaking in this incredible feeling of his mouth and tongue. I watched as he fucked me with it, like he was fucking me again, like it was his last time. This was different than anything I had ever experienced before. I thought I could feel his tongue in me, as he pulled out and replaced his hands on my thigh. I watched as he slid it slowly in and out of my pussy as I lay back against the headboard of the bed. I was his, or, his pet, as he played with my tits, my legs, my cunt, his body. I couldn't think of a way to explain myself, or to explain even himself if we did this to each other.</p> <p>He continued to work his way up my body kissing me as he went, his cock now hard as iron and thick, as he teased me. I thought for sure that I knew what was coming, but I didn't care. I just wanted him to make love to me and to give me pleasure. It was wonderful, so exciting, for me to be able to love someone I just met so recently.</p> <p>He kissed his way back down my body, kissing my breasts, taking them in his mouth and sucking them gently. He kissed my belly, my mound, my clit. He rubbed his cock all over my sex, which made me groan loudly. He stopped and looked at me, telling me how beautiful and desirable I was. How much he had loved my first time, and how much he cared for my first time.</p> <p>We kissed and touched each other for a long time. I was amazed that my body reacted as it does when I am sexually charged. I found myself telling him how beautiful he made me feel and how much I loved him, how much I loved him, even as if my lover never had touched me sexually before.</p> <p>He continued kissing and caressing me for a long time. I had my legs pulled up against him as he began fucking me with his tongue. He was making me cum again and again, but I just lay there and allowed him to enjoy me, just as he had before.</p> <p>He told me that his tongue was all of a woman's, that the taste of the woman he loved was his most cherished gift. He told me that he wanted more as his pleasure and pleasure grew with her, just as he wanted mine to grow as his. I was surprised by how many women wanted to be his, for him to have them. I wasn't surprised, I loved it all! He told me that he loved me as a woman for being his. Then he stopped, pulling his cock out of my cunt. He told me that he wanted me to take the strap on home with me to use it to fuck him again. For this second time, he wanted me as his.</p> <p>I couldn't say what I was thinking, but I knewâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
