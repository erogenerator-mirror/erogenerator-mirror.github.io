I grabbed her hips and eased forward into her.</p> <p>"She's in heat," I groaned.</p> <p>"Godda fuck," she wailed. She began to buck with me, driving herself back on to my cock hard and fast. "Fuck, I can feel it!"</p> <p>"Yeah, that's it."</p> <p>She grabbed my hips and rammed it into her. "Fuck me. Pound me," she cried. "Hard, don't stop!"</p> <p>My hips were slamming into her. I drove my cock into her, her screams intensified. "Oh, shit, you're gonna make me cum!"</p> <p>"Yes!" She was calling my name hard. "Fuck me. Fill Me Up. Knock me Up!"</p> <p>"Here it comes!" I grunted.</p> <p>Her body quaked and shook as she exploded. With each burst, the feeling of my cock deep in her pussy intensified. Her hips ground faster on me and I could feel my balls clenching, preparing to cum. She was driving my cock deep into her with each pulse and my balls sent spurt after spurt of their hot load into her hot, wet, tight, clutching pussy.</p> <p>My cum splashed her insides, bathing in after load after spurt. Her body was still quivering and shaking. Her legs were tight around me and her fingernails were digging into my shoulders as she ground her ass back into me.</p> <p>We stayed there for a minute, just breathing hard. I was finally pulled out of her and she turned around. She smiled again, her face glowed red. She looked very happy. She began to slide the strap-on over her legs and I realized I might want to get it back over with. "I'm sorry I did that," I said. "I hope I didn't hurt you."</p> <p>"It's okay," she said in a soft voice. "I love fucking guys and I love pleasing them. It's something you know about me."</p> <p>I didn't ask her what she meant, but the rest of the day passed without incident. We made love, ate dinner and took a shower again, making love until the sun came up. I was still hard, and she got a good handful of my cock, stroking it, as she sucked on my tongue. We fell asleep on the couch afterward and I woke up in the next morning, still naked with her head on my shoulder. I felt very satisfied.</p> <p>-</p> <p>The next month passed very slowly. As the end of May approached, we didn't see any signs of signs of intimacy between us, despite the fact that we hadn't fucked in at least 3 years. Her pussy had been raw, too sore for her to get off the weekends. It looked as though she was going to get a couple of good fucks that weekend and I could only hope. She had asked me to stay away from the house and to stay with her, so I did, but in her mind that only had to do with having the house rented out again.</p> <p>She looked upset when I did not come home for hours on end. I could tell she was really thinking about this and she finally asked me to stay away from her. I told her that I couldn't, and I didn't even want to. I knew that when she asked me to get out, things would have to change. I told her it was not that. She knew and she came clean. I was sorry I asked this. My body responded and I had to try to fight off that urge to get myself off one more time.</p> <p>-</p> <p>The next year went by. We didn't see much action; maybe 2 months in, maybe another 2. I had my two best girlfriends at our house by this time and it was hard to stay away. We had always made it a point to come home late, and I did not want her to worry. I was going to have to call or text her for every day that passed, and to keep the feeling at bay.</p> <p>My one weekend was really difficult at that time. I went straight home. I got home and saw mom's note on the door:</p> <p>Mom,</p> <p>I just want you so much that I have to ask you something.</p> <p>I know you aren't going to say anything, but I want you to know everything. I'm glad to hear that you love me and want me in your life.</p> <p>I am so sorry for putting her in that situation, but I can't let her go, can I?</p> <p>Yours,</p> <p>Roxie</p> <p>I didn't get the chance to ask her anything more, but she finally got off her phone and texted: 'Good night mom.'</p> <p>I went straight to my room and read her note again:â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
