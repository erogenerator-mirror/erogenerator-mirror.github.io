His whole body moved to make it more intense, feeling the moisture, the need increase, and now just before his hand went limp, she moved her mouth slowly back.</p> <p>It was over; it had been only another fantasy but the reality was so real, so real, so real, that it took a great deal of breath, but it was a good orgasm, and it went on, but now he wanted more. He needed another one, so long as he could get it, but it had better be good.</p> <p>He pushed a button in the air and she began sucking harder still. Her left hand moved slowly down, stopping just above her nipples, and she lifted her right breast so that the tip of it just touched the tip of her nipple. He let his hand stroke the hard nub, feeling it's response.</p> <p>She had the rhythm down as well, sucking and sucking harder on him, as his fingers went faster and harder. As soon as her mouth was free, he moved it to her right nipple again. His left hand was gently rubbing against her right, and she felt another climax starting. This time she was not going to be able to hold as much, and her whole body was shaking.</p> <p>Now he was ready, he moved his lips to her ear and whispered, "I've waited so long to do this."</p> <p>She turned and kissed him, and then pushed her tongue into his mouth. His hand came quickly between her legs, and two fingers began probing in and out.</p> <p>"I want to do it again if you can wait," he told her.</p> <p>With that, she lay back on the bed, her legs spread wide, her head near the foot of the bed. He moved in, his face at her pussy, and she opened it to his fingers. As his tongue found her clit, she let out a long moan.</p> <p>As his tongue found it's way to her lips, which were already wet, she grabbed his head, and drew him closer. The taste was as salty and tangy as the moment had been in reality. She moaned some more, and his tongue was moving in her as fast as his fingers.</p> <p>As he moved his head back, he moved it back and forth. When he went back to her clit, she let out a short moan and pushed herself deeper onto his tongue. He could feel her body tighten, the muscles start to twitch while she climaxed.</p> <p>"It came," she whispered, "it just happened, it's like someone else, it just happened."</p> <p>When her breathing calmed, she looked down at him. The look of confusion crossed her face, but she took in several deep breaths, and smiled contentedly.</p> <p>He took his mouth and chin dry, and smiled again. While he was still admiring her, he brought his hands to her lips, and she parted them with her tongue. He moved down to her left hip and pushed his tongue through the small valley of cleavage that she was hiding. When he reached her thigh, he licked the inside of it.</p> <p>She smiled up at him, and felt his lips move forward. "Can I kiss you for a long time?" she whispered into his ear. She wanted to go for him the moment the words came out, but she didn't want to spoil the dream that she had of him.</p> <p>"Yes," he responded, "You can have all you want. I'll kiss you forever."</p> <p>His lips found hers again and she reached down and gently stroked his face, eyes and hair with her fingertips. She knew that this wasn't just a short but long-lasting romantic coupling, and she knew that he had the ability to move past the next step, as his lips parted hers and his tongue shot inside her mouth.</p> <p>She leaned over and kissed him again, feeling her nipples press against his chest and feel his hardness against her stomach. She felt as light as a feather, and she was ready for anything at this point.</p> <p>Her hand moved down to his stomach and she moved her hips in a figure eight that she had gotten from him, but she wasn't sure how much he would respond if she went any farther. Her desire was building, and she didn't know if she could make him come, but if it had to do with the thought of the man he had so recently known.</p> <p>He moved his hands to her hips and pulled her up to him, and she could feel his penis rub against her belly.</p> <p>She moved her hips, and she could feel it move slightly as well. He could move his arms; they would just make it easier on herselfâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
