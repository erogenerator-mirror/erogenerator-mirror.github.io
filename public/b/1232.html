His hands were already on her buttocks and she felt his fingers dig into her hips as he started to fuck her with steady hard thrusts. They both were panting quietly now, both very aware of each other, both in the aftermath of their lovemaking. She knew that the moment of truth had come, knew she had to ask.</p> <p>She nodded, almost absently, and kissed him again. His hand came up and caressed her cheek. She could almost feel the warmth of his skin on her face and neck. She let herself be carried away again, letting him do what he would. As his body pushed into hers and his cock swelled once more into her, she cried out softly. He reached round and grabbed her tits, pulling on one nipple before it had even begun to harden, pinching it between his thumb and forefinger. She moaned her appreciation but quickly let him have his way. He let go of her breasts and gripped her buttocks again fiercely, spreading them and squeezing them.</p> <p>She cried out again, more loudly, and he stopped, pulling her back against his loins. She let her mouth fall open and let his tongue do what it wanted, probing against her bottom lip, tasting it. His hand came down on both of her cheeks, holding her there, rubbing them. She felt the heat rising in her cheeks and was sure that he was burning up with lust. She tried to press her legs together but the material of her dress restricted her. Now the effect of his body was starting to affect her, the dampness between her legs became more evident.</p> <p>His body came down on her with even more urgency and she felt his fingers on her clitoris in the dim light. She let her head fall back and looked up pleadingly. She was helpless and she wanted to be made to feel as dirty as he felt.</p> <p>He pressed her against the wall again, his head went down and rested on her breast. She could feel the stubble on his chin scratching against her cheek, leaving streaks of black on her skin just as his finger pressed and rubbed against her clitoris, and she was moaning at the feel of it. He held her there, holding her for only a fraction of an inch before sliding inwards, his finger pressing hard on her clitoris. She cried out, the sound echoing around the room: but not in the bedroom, only in the office.</p> <p>He pushed harder, still holding her and then suddenly plunged it in as far as it would go. Her body jerked with an exclamation, and the movement of his hand on her clitoris made her cry out again. He was so hard and so big and she felt the whole length of his length push its way into her. Her fingers reached down to find and grip the wall behind them, still holding onto the carpet where it had been. He moved a few more inches but then withdrew, almost leaving her with only the head of his shaft against her, still hard. She whimpered and held onto the carpet, feeling utterly empty and helpless under the weight of him on top of her. She had no idea why he would stop.</p> <p>His body moved down her body, pressing his head against her tummy and her heart pounded. Her hips rose to meet him, taking him deep inside her. The head of his organ pushed against her cervix as he thrust forward once more. He held them there for a moment, his body moving against hers.</p> <p>She felt it. The heat of his body on hers, the tension of his body on hers, the pressure on her bottom as he held himself against her. Now she began to raise herself to meet him, to meet his thrust. His hands were on her buttocks now, holding her, his thumbs rubbing her clitoris. He was moving hard in her, and she felt as if she would explode.</p> <p>And then his body pushed forward, sliding his full length deep within her. Hot juices were flowing down her legs from her cunt and her own desire took over. She was crying out now, her body thrusting to meet him as his body continued to thrust, pushing as far into her as it could. She wanted him to come with her. Wanted him to feel as if he was being fucked, as if he was in a world of his own.</p> <p>And then it was done. His body fell on top of hers. Hardness was now coursing through their bodies with every thrust. It felt like a lightning blast. She felt the hard throbbing of his cock as it plunged into her. It almost hurt as it slid over the surface, but she could feel his hardness rubbing the walls of her body. She pushed her pussy back against him, trying to meet him as he slid in and out of her, fucking her as hard as he could.
