Are you going to tell me about it now?"</p> <p>"Honey, would you ever get your pussy pierced?" she asked.</p> <p>It was all I could do not to get up and follow her into the bathroom. We'd never gone for it.</p> <p>"Honey, I don't know."</p> <p>I couldn't believe my ears. "Why don't you go for it now?" she said.</p> <p>"Do I have to?" I asked, surprised at myself.</p> <p>"Honey, no! Don't you have anything to go with?"</p> <p>"Well, I'll wait." I couldn't believe it. "What would my wife think of the thought of me going for it?"</p> <p>"Honey," she said. "Let me talk to her. I have the perfect idea."</p> <p>"Alright!" I said. "I'll listen."</p> <p>I went into the bathroom to get myself started on a razor blade that I keep in the bag with mine, and found it in an armoire. I opened it and there were some things I used that I didn't have. I didn't have a razor blade so after some thought I just had my back to her. I took the shaving cream and lathered the blade up and then shaved the area in the middle of the pussy lips without touching the hair. I looked at myself in the mirror as I shaved in front of the mirror. This would explain the reason why I shaved. It would also explain why I didn't like showing it to anybody. I took off my clothes and laid the shaving cream on the chair and then I sat down in front of the mirror and started to shave myself.</p> <p>When I finished, I had everything shaved and looked at myself again. I started to go through my pubic hair. I trimmed it to a fine blonde, but I left it too short. I then looked at myself in the mirror again. Now that I was completely waxed, I noticed that the hair in the sides of my pussy was very short. I didn't think that I'd ever be able to cut it off again after I had my first piercing. I kept thinking about what I should do with it, but it felt so weird that I had to give it up to my friends. Now that my pussy looked like a little slice of heaven, I could never really go for it once the piercing was done.</p> <p>I finished up and then walked back to my chair and sat there looking at myself. I had a small scar on my left arm as a birthmark, but no hair in the pubic area. I had a few scrapes and bruises that I didn't feel comfortable with. I tried my best to get a straight flush on my face.</p> <p>When I was finished and thinking that I had no more on me, I left, thinking that I would never see her again except at the last minute, so I ran down the street and found someone who lived close to me. He was from England and told me that she was his ex-girlfriend. He told me that he didn't think I was a real friend and that she had asked him to move back to her. I told him that I wasn't interested in him. He told me that he just wanted to fuck me. I told him of my next visit, and what he told me to do. I told him that I'd call her if I wanted to. I then said I felt weird calling him and then he started to laugh. I told him that he'd give me a call whenever he wanted. He told me he didn't expect me to call him, but then he started to laugh when I told him that it was going to come out tonight.</p> <p>I had to wait a week to see if he would call. It seemed that he never called me.</p> <p>I spent my next Wednesday night going through my hair in a very neat fashion shop. When I came home that evening, I could not believe what I had done. My hair fell into a mess of red hair on my shoulders, on the middle part of my back, on the top of my left tit and a big streak in my bush. My boobs were covered by my bra, but the top of my bush was covering parts of my breasts, most of which were exposed. A couple months later that hair was mussed up from the hair trimmings I had done the night before, and they looked fantastic. I had a small tattoo of a butterfly with a butterfly cross between the nipples and around my pussy. I also had this one in a random order. I guess they were randomâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
