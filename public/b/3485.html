It had been almost a month since we were last together, and he had told her he hoped she enjoyed their time together as much as they had. But the best part of it was that his wife was a little girl as well, and they had all had fun together!</p> <p>Well, the following week was the longest day in my life, and I was ready to be a little girl again as soon as possible! As she was getting ready, she told me she was going to her own room to take her shower at the same time as I was getting ready. I looked at my watch and then looked at the time: 1:30 AM. How long would it take her to get out of bed? What time would I need? How much time would I have to wait?</p> <p>There was a knock on my door at 1:30 AM. "Hi Dad, come on in. I'm in the shower!" she said in a sing-song voice.</p> <p>"Hi, Honey! How did you sleep? I'm glad you slept. Did you sleep well?"</p> <p>"Uh, you know the answer to that. When I woke up in the morning, I felt like my heart was really pounding. So it was kind of a good thing that I did."</p> <p>"Well, just be careful," I answered as I kissed her goodnight.</p> <p>I took her and walked through the living room to the stairs, where I heard some of her soapy-sounding laughter as she reached down and kissed my cheek. "Well, he sure is a lucky guy... or so I'm certain...!"</p> <p>I turned her to the bathroom and started to open the door. "I don't think you should go in there."</p> <p>"Honey, I don't want to do this. Don't worry, I'll come in anyway. I just want to shower and have a bath"</p> <p>"No, don't. I want to. Besides," she added, as she pulled the shower door open, "I'm not having a bath now... for you!"</p> <p>I stepped inside the shower. The steam was warm and comforting on my hands and knees. She was standing above me, water cascading over her face, hair and body, and it felt almost like someone had poured it on me! The water was hot and had a sweet tingly/angry lather to it!</p> <p>"Just stand still," I said, "You don't want to get it on me. That water is too warm... just let it flow over you!"</p> <p>"Okay Dad," she said, with a little hesitation, "Okay!"</p> <p>"I like that!"</p> <p>There was not much to remove the water from my body. Not that I minded. I'm sure her hairless pussy would feel good, too!</p> <p>I was right.</p> <p>After finishing the shower, I quickly dressed and left. She had some things she wanted to do, but if she wanted to meet my parents again, she'd have to do it at home... she needed to get settled... before her parents came home for the third time. And that sounded great! That would make it much easier to get going!</p> <p>I returned to my car on Tuesday afternoon, just as there was a knock at the door. It was Mrs. Wilson, the owner of the business... I have a business! I told her I would help her out. "Of course, Son," she said, "I'm a very pretty young lady, and I'm sure my husband appreciates how I looked today. You can call it my 'little girl' business!" I thought she had been talking to my parents about the business.</p> <p>"I think I can get you to help me here," I said. "Would I be permitted to join you here?"</p> <p>"Sure, Sis... I'd love to come!" she smiled widely.</p> <p>"Well, if you and your husband would like...," I said, "It would be nice to have dinner with us if you do."</p> <p>"That would be wonderful, Sis!" was all she said.</p> <p>We met at the restaurant. Mrs. Wilson was already there, and we talked to each other for a few minutes. I was quite happy when we had a chance, as it meant we could talk about everything. After dinner, she sat me at the counter and asked me to buy her a car. I asked if she were ready to go out tonight, but there were no 'anything out there'.</p> <p>"I think so, too," she said, "I'm not much about 'anything that's out there' - but I would love to goâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
