This was strange. And exciting. I was so happy to see him, and I was sure he was happy to see me too.</p> <p>I felt another pair of hands on my face and it brought me back to being alone with him. But even as I tried to move away, I was held by his gaze, and I realized I had been staring at him and it was more than I could bear. I was frightened and excited by the feeling of intimacy and excitement that his touch evoked.</p> <p>My face was flushed as I looked at him, and I knew I should apologize for staring at him so openly. I couldn't. I knew if I did, I'd be embarrassed, but I didn't. For that reason I didn't move again as his hands continued to rub my face.</p> <p>I let him have his way with me. I felt his warm fingers on my cheeks. "Don't say anything," he whispered in my ear.</p> <p>"Are you alright?" he asked.</p> <p>I nodded. "I'm ok," I added.</p> <p>Then I saw him move away and I felt the bed sag as a second pair of hands began to massage my arms. With one hand, he caressed my body with the rough material of my t-shirt. He moved his hand down to my upper arm, and he slid the material slowly down my body. I felt my body tense when he touched my skin.</p> <p>When he reached the end of my chest, he pressed my breasts firmly, and my breasts were so full and firm that they ached with the tension. My nipples hardened immediately at his touch.</p> <p>I could feel myself becoming aroused again, and even as my body tried to fight it's self, it grew desperate for attention from his hand on my body.</p> <p>I didn't say a word. I was so excited I felt my heart beating fast and my breathing ragged. I could feel his breathing on the side of my face. Then, without warning, the hands that were in front of me slid off my breasts, and I felt the cold air on them.</p> <p>A hard slap came at me on my back. My whole body reacted to the shock; a sudden heat went through me and my skin tingled and tinged with a burning, all over, a feeling that was almost painful. The feeling became unbearable and again, I tried to move, but he held me in place with his arm.</p> <p>"This is going to happen," he said, and I felt another pair of hands on my body now. They were different, more familiar.</p> <p>They didn't touch me but they pushed their hands over my body and my body became very nervous. I felt like I was going to let them do that to me. They wanted to touch me, to make me feel like a woman. And to make me excited.</p> <p>This seemed to make him think that it wouldn't be a man's job to make me excited. I felt him push the backs of my legs apart, and then I felt my panties being pulled aside by his fingers. My legs parted easily. They were spread wide, and the touch of their fingers sent an electric shock through my whole body. The wetness inside of my pussy felt like ice, and a second set of fingers moved inside of me and I shuddered and cried. I was getting more and more aroused, and I was shaking.</p> <p>I don't know how long they were playing, but they never stopped, never stopped their touches, never stopped my breathing. Their hands moved over me all over again. I didn't want to admit it, but I thought to myself, in this moment, that it was because it felt like a dream.</p> <p>The fingers on my breasts now traveled to my nipples. They kept on rubbing my nipples and I gasped, and then I heard it at first just as I felt it. A series of gasps and moans, like noises that were part of sexual pleasure, escaped my lips.</p> <p>I was aware of another pair of hands touching my thighs now. They slid up and around between my legs, and I felt it spread me open to their hands. My whole body seemed to be on fire. As they touched my body, I couldn't feel, I couldn't feel anything like it, but as my body was on fire, I was sure that I was going to die of shame.</p> <p>As hands touched my body, they felt all over my body: my head, my shoulder blades, my hips, my breasts, my abdomen, and my legs. I was shaking violently, I was moaning almost uncontrollably. My lips felt on the edge of my chest, and the kisses sent me mad. They were making my whole body writhe with delight, almost asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
