"And it will leave you hungry for it to begin with."</p> <p>She had finished her drink and had me take a sip of the wine, telling me that this was a first year for her but at least she didn't expect it any sooner than she wanted me to be. I took another sip of it as the music started to sound again. She walked over to a guy that she had gone to work with at the bar and started dancing. They made several slow songs until their second one ended.</p> <p>She took me back to the room and I was surprised to have the door locked in the back. It had a lock on it. We went into the room and took the room to the right. There was only one bed, though it was a small one and I did so because I was curious about it. When I closed the door, she asked me to undress. When I was down to my boxers, she took out a dildo and told me that it was vibrating. She was still standing in front of me and with the other hand, she was gently guiding the end of the strap-on around my waist. She stood back and told me to get on my knees. I obediently put my hands back to where the dildo was attached to me. She pulled me over to the bed and told her that I was to assume the doggy position. She stepped off the bed and took some items out from the nightstand. I still couldn't see, but I knew that she had set everything up and I looked around the room as she walked back and handed me a large dildo.</p> <p>She said that she wanted me to wear a condom and that she was going to go slow, but it would just take a minute to get her nice and lubed up.</p> <p>I turned around when I felt her hands on my ass making sure that all that contact was there. She knelt down and put the rubber cock on my butt as I sat on the edge of the bed. I felt her finger going between my cheeks as it slid across and up between my pussy lips and then she pushed in just a little so that the end of the rubber cock was rubbing my clit. It only felt a little different than my fingers did with the dildo. I told her that it actually felt good.</p> <p>She got up and got some lube on a vibrating object from the nightstand. She asked me if I wanted to try it, and I replied that I would if she was interested. She took my panties off as I leaned forward and got to work on my clit and pussy lips. With one hand, she rubbed the fake cock over my ass which was still a little sore from having my ass pounded. She took it out of my ass with a loud 'pop' and put both hands on the dildo sticking out like a snake. It slid in just a little, then out all the way, then back in. It had a strange way that was going in so easily. I had the fake cock in just a little bit before she got up and grabbed the lubricant. Once she had me ready, she put both hands on my hips and pulled me back over the edge of the bed. I felt the dildo sliding back in on the other side and then it started to slide back out just a little, then it started to slide back in, it wasn't quite what I was used to it sliding in slow and easy.</p> <p>It wasn't going in very hard and the feeling was amazing. She grabbed both hands and kept pulling me back on the other side as she kept the rhythm going. It was a nice rhythm to start with and it wasn't too long before I felt the end of that thing sliding against my prostate. I was still playing with my clit a little when the dildo started working its magic and it was a good feeling as it had a little more speed to it, but it was more intense. I knew that it wouldn't take long to come and it was good because of the dildo sliding in me when she grabbed my hips.</p> <p>The sensations were fantastic, my cock had a mind of its own and was getting thicker as the feelings went on. I felt her hands start to work the rubber cock over my g-spot and it wasn't long before my orgasm started to start. I started to get a little shaky. She slowed the pace a little as my second orgasm started, this one didn't take its effect on the dildo that was still in me. I was shaking so much that I had to move my ass with her to get it inside meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
