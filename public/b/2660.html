I asked.</p> <p>He smiled at me and held my chin with his hand. I couldn't answer. It was still too dark, too dark to be asleep yet.</p> <p>"Oh, it was you," he said. "It was me."</p> <p>His hand moved to cup my face again and he kissed me gently on the lips and then, with infinite tenderness, he pulled the box off from my hands. I could not take the moment anymore, so I gave in to the kiss. I was so lost in it that I felt as though my body was about to explode. I opened the box and then closed it over my face and hands. As I stood there in our living room, kissing him gently, I became aware of the coolness of the night sky. I felt the softness of the cotton blanket against my skin and then he leaned down and began to kiss me again. We had been together for so long it surprised me when not just to discover my first passionate kiss with a man, but also to take it in such a small context. I felt his hands exploring me, running through my hair, around my shoulder blades, and then, his lips found their way down to my neck, nibbling along the vein of my neck as he nibbled, kissed, suckled and pulled on my neck. He slid down to his knees and I could feel his eyes as he traced my body from the collarbone down to the swell of my breasts and to back, circling over my tummy with his fingertips. I had never felt his touch on any part of my body before. He continued with the sensual tracing of my body and when he finally took me in his mouth I felt every fiber of my body go taut and electrified with the anticipation of it finally feeling the touch of another man. I was aching for this, and I couldn't even breathe. He was the first man to touch me in so many ways; he certainly took my pleasure, but to go lower, to use his mouth like he'd seen someone use her mouth before, I craved it. I felt the pulse of his blood in his mouth and in his hand but I didn't understand a word. I had never felt so much lust.</p> <p>"It feels good having you in my mouth," he murmured in my ear. "I want you so much it hurts." I could not help but look at the expression on his face. I'd never dreamed him looking so desperate. "Do you like watching?" he asked me.</p> <p>I felt so dirty having to ask such a question. When I was a young girl, I had to have secrets from all of my friends and relatives. I didn't want to think about telling them because it was embarrassing, that some people might think something was wrong with me, but now I felt it was important to ask them.</p> <p>"Yes, I like watching, it makes me feel like I can do whatever I want to you and you'll never know what to do from here," I answered him, looking down at him. I wondered to myself if I felt that I was about to be unfaithful to my husband.</p> <p>He kissed me again, and then he stood up and I felt my eyes widen again, I had to take in this, I had to make a connection. I wanted it, I needed it - it felt right, I just didn't know if my body was so ready to allow, needed him to take me there and know how to please me as he had me before. "Are you sure?" he asked, gently pulling me up. I didn't respond, just gave a weak smile. He held me close and I felt his warm hands, his loving and reassuring tone, that way he never made me feel like I didn't belong to who I am. I had no doubt that I was no longer a child anymore. I was still afraid of what was left of my old self.</p> <p>He led me to the bedroom where he laid me on the bed, where there was no mistaking the form of someone that I knew from his work. The man, who I was supposed to love, had always known what it was that made me so eager to see the face of the man that I had loved. "Open your legs baby," he asked me.</p> <p>His voice was tender and I immediately spread my legs, welcoming him. The man moved carefully between my thighs and he took the whole thing in his mouth without taking his eyes off his task. He ran his tongue along my labia and he stopped every couple of laps with a light nibble before pushing in his tongue and he licked my clit as well. There was no going back, however, for me. I opened my eyes and stared at his face, I could feel myself melting at a hundred different lights. The man didn't seem to be inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
