I was so worried that you would think I was joking because I've not had an orgasm that fast since our honeymoon. But even when you came on my finger you were such a turn on; you took it like you were not even aware."</p> <p>"That's very sweet of you to say but really, you are so much more exciting than my husband is but my husband doesn't know I have an orgasm like that."</p> <p>"I still love you but there's only so many times in a month and you haven't climaxed that way since our honeymoon."</p> <p>The kiss stopped and Karen just sat still, looking at me. There was some confusion in her eyes and she whispered, "I can't even speak to you, but what I heard is that we're going to need to get a room at a motel."</p> <p>I thought, "That's a good idea."</p> <p>Karen stood up, walked toward me and reached down and took my hand and said, "Let's get to the room. I'll call you tomorrow." Karen turned and ran back to the office.</p> <p>At the motel I helped a small man to get into the room. He was very surprised by the size of the room and was looking at my bedroom in shock. He'd never been inside and saw an expensive king size bed with a light covering on the bed. He looked at Karen, who gave him a big smile before she said, "Oh my god, I can't believe my luck." He couldn't take his eyes off her and she went on, "I'll get my dress off and get us something to drink before we go to bed."</p> <p>The man looked at Karen and then at me, his eyes moved from me to her and they both said, "I want to fuck you very badly." She smiled at me and said, "I'm going make us one of these to go along with the wedding." She grabbed me and began kissing me while she reached down and started stroking my cock. She had the same look on her face as before and the she stopped kissing me to say, "I'm going to give you this and I don't want to stop until we're ready to fuck. But we must get a room." Karen pushed me back roughly and got to her knees. Her hands started to fumble at my belt but I told her to finish it. Karen went back and forth until I was completely in her hand and then she released me while looking up at me. I told her, "No." She looked like something was out of place but she knew what I meant. "Please," and she started to undo the belt.</p> <p>"I can't do that." I said. "You're not going to fuck me."</p> <p>She smiled at me and said, "Ok."</p> <p>My hands were starting to wander and I pulled her up. She stepped back and said, "I have one more idea before we go to bed." I moved her and we kissed. She had to pull back so she wouldn't fall. When she did she laughed and said, "That's really going to do it for me. Now just have fun while we have a nice time." We kissed and caressed for a long time.</p> <p>Karen came back with a glass of champagne and set it on the night stand next to the bed. She got out of bed and stood looking at me. There was a big bulge in her shorts and I looked at her. "Are you going to get it out?"</p> <p>She smiled that very pretty smile of hers and said, "Just a minute, I want to help you get in the big chair while I get you comfortable." I smiled at her and took her hand as we went into the big chair. She climbed up on the bed and I pulled her shorts and underwear down to her knees before I undid the top button on her shirt and pulled it off. I had a very confused look on my face. I had no idea that this lovely looking woman was going to be doing to me just what she just was.</p> <p>"I really like what you're doing with your hands, that's my job as well." She reached to caress my cock and said, "It's a little smaller than your husband's." That didn't surprise me but I still wasn't sure if Karen was being honest with me. She smiled at me and said, "I don't think our marriage will be very happy if we start fooling around while having fun."</p> <p>I thought I was going to be in shock when she lifted her thighs high and I went directly to her lips and began kissing them very delicately.</p> <p>When I finally began sucking on her nipples I couldn't do much, just hold back and have my way with her tits and justâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
