I didn't want to let go of the shaft so I slowly slid it down her throat. She couldn't get more than three inches. I slowly took about two inches from her throat. When I felt her gag reflex, I stopped and told her.</p> <p>"If you ever think about swallowing that again, be sure to ask him for permission."</p> <p>"Thank you Master! Thank you!"</p> <p>"Now cum for me like you love to cum!"</p> <p>A loud grunt left her mouth as her pussy went into overdrive.</p> <p>"Uggghhh!"</p> <p>I was right in front. I could have came at the thought. I could see the cum start to leak out of her eyes, running out of her mouth and down onto her breasts. She was still spasming as my dick slid in deeper. She came for a long time. We went up and down until we both got exhausted.</p> <p>"Thank you Master! Thank you!"</p> <p>We stayed together like that for almost 10 minutes. When I was able to make it back to my apartment, I knew I needed to be in bed with her.</p> <p>I was lying on my back, not to move anything and not wanting to wake her. She turned toward me and started to turn toward me. However, she dropped to her knees and straddling my stomach. She was facing the mirror behind the closet door. As she stood up, she held my limp dick in her hands and started to rub it.</p> <p>"Master! I have never had so much cock in me and just touching it. It feels like I have just come home from work!"</p> <p>She leaned down, kissed my dick then gave it a good tug. I was feeling somewhat guilty, but it was the end of the day and I needed to pay a visit to the head of my penis.</p> <p>As I made my way back to a position between her legs, my dick was once again ready to make an appearance. She turned her head to the right and looked at me.</p> <p>"Master, have you had oral sex with anyone since your divorce?"</p> <p>"If I were in any state, there are no guys to do it for. However, I don't give my employees the opportunity to have oral sex with my wife. I think you are wonderful and will come back again!"</p> <p>"Thank you Master, I will be back. I'd like to do it in the morning."</p> <p>As I went to sleep with her, I was thinking of how much I enjoyed her mouth and pussy and she was remembering how much she enjoyed her orgasm that night. It felt to me like a true compliment. I was also thinking about what it would be like if she were to do it herself as well. It made me sad but in no way was one more day over than the day itselfâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
