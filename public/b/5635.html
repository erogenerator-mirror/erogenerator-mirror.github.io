She was so close to coming I could feel it on my fingers.</p> <p>"You want it, don't you Laura?" I asked her.</p> <p>"God, yes! Yes! Oh god, yes!" Laura shouted, pushing down hard on my hand as spasm after spasm of pleasure wracked her body. "Yes!" she squealed as another orgasm shook her. "Oh god!" she wailed as I kept my fingers pressed against her throbbing clit. Finally, she slid off me and lay back, breath hard and eyes full of love. I took her hand and licked her juices off mine.</p> <p>"Oh, that was wonderful, Mr. Evans," she moaned. "Thank you. That was amazing!" Her fingers found mine and she took it in her mouth to suck on it, then kissed my hand. "I'd like to see you again. Will you be wanting to make love to me again?" She smiled at me.</p> <p>"I'd be glad to do that, Laura. I want to see what we've accomplished." I laughed.</p> <p>"Will you be able to make love to me again, Mr. Evans?" she laughed as she looked up at me.</p> <p>"Absolutely," I replied. "I'd like for you to make love to me again, just one time, Laura." My face was still red from the climax I'd just received from our love making.</p> <p>"And then I want to be prepared for it." I couldn't believe my own words because I'd just said them! Of course, it still thrilled me to see a woman so sexually liberated being ready to have sex with me again, and it made my heart burn with joy to know that I'd pleased her. She giggled and looked up. "I think I'd like that," she said, still looking at my face.</p> <p>"Then what?" I wanted to know, but not knowing where this was going.</p> <p>"Would I be in a position to refuse?" she said. It made me think of a situation from the previous day where she made a promise to me: she'd never have sex with anyone but me before the wedding if she wanted to. But then she also seemed to want it after seeing me with David, so I think it made perfect sense to her.</p> <p>"Sure, Laura. Whatever you want." I knew that she'd come to me and we'd make some very important decisions in our lives. The thought made me feel as though I was about to be made love to again, and Laura was about to be a part of it!</p> <p>I was about to say "Yes," when Laura put her hand on my chest.</p> <p>"Are you sure, Mr. Evans?" she asked.</p> <p>"Positively," I admitted.</p> <p>"Let me think about it." I pulled her up so we could see the bed and I sat down on the side of it and Laura looked at me and said, "You've got some lovely underwear," then she looked back to where I was watching her and laughed. "Oh, God, Mr. Evans, what if David had seen?"</p> <p>"That'd be great, wouldn't it, Laura?" I asked.</p> <p>"Absolutely," she said. "But now I think I'd want to see if he would." She sat down on my lap and kissed me softly on the lips. "I would do anything you said of course," she said, looking me in the eyes again. "And if it doesn't please him, that's all right too."</p> <p>"I think I'd be in a difficult position about whether he actually enjoyed it or not," I added. "Would you let me do that?"</p> <p>Laura smiled at me and kissed me, her hand playing with my still hard cock. "No, that's OK. I'd just be happy to help your love making technique."</p> <p>"I'm sure that David wouldn't mind if I made you a promise," I told her. I felt it might be good from her first reaction to it. But she was already feeling pretty good as well.</p> <p>I kissed her again and then I asked her to lie over my shoulder and I told her to roll over so I wasn't on top of her. Laura was surprised because I'd thought she did that in the heat of passion, but it really didn't bother her. She was very happy. In fact, it was nice to do it with someone that loved me, and now she could do it with someone that she loved.</p> <p>"Now, Mr. Evans, you can do it," she said, "and you can do it right." She pushed her hips up and back and I rolled her hips over so she could see how my cock wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
