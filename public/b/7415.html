"Sometimes we're both scared to talk about it just for a few minutes or the sex is so intense. No matter how intimate it is you'll only feel that way when you tell me about fucking."</p> <p>"But it has something to do with that." She replied. "I can smell your sexiness. And I want to smell it all!"</p> <p>I took a last deep breath and put my hands on the arm of the couch. The music changed to some slower stuff and she looked up and saw my mood lighten. She had her hands wrapped around my hips as she looked down at me through the fabric of my robe. She looked up at me again and smiled.</p> <p>"I see it's been a while since we've had a good threesome. How was it for you?" she said breathlessly.</p> <p>"The best" I replied, "for both of us."</p> <p>"You really have a nice ass, Tim." She said, giving it a playful squeeze with her hand. "And I think that's why they say we should take a shower before dinner."</p> <p>"We certainly don't need them, but it does fit you pretty well," I added. "So, where do we go from here?"</p> <p>"We have a lot of time until we can pick up your things upstairs tomorrow and have you dress up for dinner." She smiled and said, "I think we might go from there ... just give me a few minutes with you." She turned and headed up the stairs.</p> <p>"If we can't get the other night out of our minds we sure shouldn't spend the night, but I think we'll take off now," I said.</p> <p>After a couple of minutes it occurred to me that she had to have her purse, her phone, a new CD, and her vibrator. I called the house and, luckily there were no other visitors to be found there. When the guys and I opened the doors we had to look up to see if anything was in the house. I saw her looking around with the other women and it didn't look like the other women were there. I knew they weren't and the sound of the music and the sound of the people's voices added to the mystery to the whole situation. It didn't take long to find out it was just another couple in our group that we didn't know about. When I walked into the living room with the girls I could see them all sitting there talking.</p> <p>After about 20 to 30 minutes I decided to go up and talk to them. When I approached the couch the girls were no longer looking at me. They were both dressed up in bathrobes with a wide, flimsy robe covering most of their body.</p> <p>"It looks like you won't be able to find anyplace to go!" I said to Tina.</p> <p>"Well," Tina replied, "we need to go get ready for dinner."</p> <p>We walked past them without saying anything and started to head upstairs. Tina said, "Tim, why don't you stay for dinner? We'll go get you dressed." She looked down at me and started to smile slightly. "But I don't think we're going to want to spoil a nice nice dinner." She pulled at my arm, indicating that I should put her purse on the couch.</p> <p>We both sat down at the table and Tina began to get the girls started.</p> <p>"We've wanted to come up and see you for a while," Tina said, "but now it's just not the time."</p> <p>By now the girls knew we had no objections but I didn't want to be the only one to break out of the conversation. I got a plate of salad I'd made last week out of the fridge. The food was a really good deal, and I think that Tina was surprised. She took me around the house to the bathroom to change and I gave the girls each a towel at the end of the couch. When I started to walk up the stairs, Tina told me to wait.</p> <p>"Hey!" I thought I heard one of the other women from the kitchen say when I came through the door. "The bathroom is right over there."</p> <p>I moved quickly down the steps to the kitchen and had just knocked myself back down into the kitchen area. I stopped and looked around the kitchen briefly, seeing my friends sitting at the table taking everything off. I heard the sound of a belt being opened and then the sound of clothes being removed. I saw the door open and then I heard more clothes flying across the room.</p> <p>I stood up straight and walked over to where the girls were standing in front of me. The only thing that kept me from being too far away from them was the robe and the fact that neither of them was wearing anything underneath itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
