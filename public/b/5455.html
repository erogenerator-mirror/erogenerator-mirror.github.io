"I was going to pick up the car but got a phone call just before I got to your room." Mary gave her daughter a big hug and left the table.</p> <p>Dee looked over at the car and said, "You don't know how much I love taking care of Dad. I've been going out with him every weekend for three months now, but I'm not about to let him do anything to you. I want to give Mom your first birthday present!"</p> <p>"You're so sweet," she said, kissing Dee passionately and pulling herself to meet her. "What do you have planned for your new boyfriend?" She asked, pulling back and blushing.</p> <p>"Well, I think I'm gonna go have some fun with him," she said, grinning when she saw Dee's hand on her other breast. "I really, really hate the thought of not having sex with my Dad."</p> <p>"Why? What's wrong with him?" Dee asked, still in mid-sentence when Mary came back to embrace her.</p> <p>"I don't have the 'F' word! And I'm not going to do that!" Mary said dramatically, laughing at her mother.</p> <p>They held each other for a minute or so before Mary broke the embrace and said, "Let's do the dishes, I need to get ready and see my husband-to-be and find some clothes."</p> <p>"Yeah, go!" Dee said. They got up and went into the bedroom.</p> <p>Dee took off her clothes, tossed them in the hamper, and then turned to see what Mary was hiding under the bedding. She had just gotten undressed, laying on the bed in front of her and putting on a cute, baby blue nightgown. She also found her bathrobe and went to Mary's closet where she pulled on the gown and pulled it over her head. Then she got in the shower.</p> <p>Mary told her daughter not to mind staying until Dee got back from shopping at the store. "You can stay as long as you like," she said. "So long that you get to wear more than the other clothes I brought."</p> <p>"Thanks mom. I never thought I'd ever get my hair so dark. Just a little, but it's a real turn-on," Dee said. "What about Mom?"</p> <p>"I've got some time to kill if it comes to that," Mary said.</p> <p>They finished washing the dishes, put them in the dishwasher, returned to the bedroom and went to bed. They had a few hours before they would have to pick up the family for the evening. Mary put on a short pink nightie and crawled into bed beside Dee, holding her tightly in her arms. She was exhausted and was soon too.</p> <p>The next morning they were both up and in the kitchen. They ate breakfast, made some toast, washed and put the dishes away. As they were preparing to eat they heard the front door open and a shadow passed by. Mary looked out the window and saw Dee's father and his brother walking to their truck. Dee noticed her father's eyes were fixed on her father as she put the dishes into the washer. The older man was about 30 years old.</p> <p>"What do you think you're doing?" she cried out as she ran out of the room. She ran to her bedroom door, pulled it open again and tried to run away again.</p> <p>"Oh Mary!" Dee said as she pulled her mother in for a hug. "Oh, Mom, don't be mad!" She hugged her mother and held her for several long seconds.</p> <p>"Oh honey! What are you so happy to see?" Dee asked.</p> <p>"Don't you want to be with me?" Mary asked. "I told you I wanted one of my men. I never thought about it really. But now I do and I just can't help myself. I know you are my father and you'll love me no matter what!"</p> <p>"Mom! Don't you want to be with me, too?"</p> <p>"Yes! It's a dream come true for both of us."</p> <p>Dee hugged her mother tightly. And then she said, "Mom! You're just going to have to find your way home again. Your father and brother are going to be there, too."</p> <p>"Yes, I know. Mom! My father, my husband, my brother-in-law, my husband-in-law!" Dee said, hugging her mother tightly and pulling her as close as possible.</p> <p>They kissed each other on the mouth and then walked to the truck. "Let's put the dishes away and get to my home and take my car!" Dee said into her ear.</p> <p>They got in the truck and droveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
