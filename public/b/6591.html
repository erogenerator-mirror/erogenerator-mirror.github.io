I asked her, wondering if she thought I was insane when I looked at her face.</p> <p>She just smiled and shook her head.</p> <p>"I think I may have to be on the rag in a minute," she said, "The last thing you said to me was, 'I don't do this kind of thing anymore'."</p> <p>"Are you okay, baby?" I asked her, "Do you want me to stop?"</p> <p>"No," she said, "just relax, it's okay. Please."</p> <p>I let my arms go and she pulled me to her. She opened her legs and I entered her gently, feeling her vagina tighten around me in response. It felt so warm and inviting, I pulled back until her labia were tight with each withdrawal and pushed back into her slowly. She let her legs fall to the bed and I thrust in again, feeling her pussy contract and grip me gently and her body begin to shake. I thrust hard this time, my hands grasping her butt cheeks as my cock filled her with my cock, feeling like it was moving through me everytime I pulled out.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" I asked her, feeling her body tense in my arms around her legs.</p> <p>"Yes, fuck me!" she screamed, "Let it go."</p> <p>"Are you going to come now, or do you want to come?" I asked her.</p> <p>"I may just blow before I do, and then we can stop," she said.</p> <p>Her pussy was tightening harder, pressing more insistently against me. I pounded her as she came, feeling my own orgasm approaching and enjoying the tension.</p> <p>"I'm coming!" I screamed, pumping my cum into her.</p> <p>"Yes," she said. Then to my surprise she put her hands over her mouth and moaned uncontrollably, "Oh, don't take it out!" I kept coming as my cock spurted out over my stomach and onto the duvet, until I had completely emptied myself.</p> <p>"Jesus Christ!" I heard her say after a minute or two.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm going to get my breathing back now." she said, giggling as I lay beside her, breathing hard.</p> <p>"You do that like a lot," I said, "I can't do it all on the bed."</p> <p>"Sorry," she said, "I can't think of anything to put it on that'll do."</p> <p>"That'd be just fine with me," I replied, "It's good to get your breath back, it's been a while."</p> <p>"I'm still recovering from my orgasm." she said.</p> <p>"It has been, right when the lights went down." I responded.</p> <p>She reached over to the armchair and drew a tattered box from the chest of drawers.</p> <p>In it was a single sheet of paper. I picked it up, looked at it, and then back to her.</p> <p>"I see we don't have any condoms," I said.</p> <p>She looked at the scrap of paper and thought for a minute. "No, we do."</p> <p>"Well that's one way of putting it," I replied, "You can't be too careful. We're on our anniversary next month, remember?"</p> <p>"Sure, whatever you like," she replied grinning.</p> <p>She read the sheet of paper once more, this time with an 'I wish you didn't know this' kind of smile.</p> <p>"What's your plan for our anniversary?" I asked her.</p> <p>"It's a birthday present," she said, pulling the sheet of paper close to her face. "That's a good gift." she said with a grin.</p> <p>"You know, in this house, the only thing you really get for your birthday is my pussy," she said taking the paper and running her fingernails up and down the edge of the sheet.</p> <p>"It might be my birthday later, but right now I'm just getting started," she replied, "Do you want me to bring the camera?"</p> <p>"Yes, that would be great." I was looking forward to the day that my cock wouldn't be aching as it had been the past week.</p> <p>"Great," she said and left the room.</p> <p>"What do you think, if I can get you to fuck me later?" I asked.</p> <p>"I think I can handle that! We could take the picture later, or the video afterwards," she replied.</p> <p>"I think it might be nice to try," I said and I got up and went over to the dresser near her bed. I fished the camera out of the drawer and handed it to Amanda.
