I said.</p> <p>"Please? Are you kidding?" He said.</p> <p>"No! No! Please!" I said. Even as my orgasm was fading and the tears were coming out.</p> <p>"You can have the bedroom. But first I want to find out what he did to you. I'm not going to give you a chance to explain."</p> <p>"Please, please!" I said a little more loudly. But again his hands were on my shoulders. "You're going back out! I'll pay you back for what, what, what happened!"</p> <p>"No!"</p> <p>"Please, don't be angry until I do." I said. "Please don't put me in the car!"</p> <p>"OK!" He said and he reached under my skirt. He pulled my skirt down and I kicked it off. He was right about me being naked in the car. It wasn't my legs that were on fire; it was his mouth and tongue that made me go over the edge. He kissed my thighs and licked me through my panties. He lifted me up and laid me down on the seat. Then he slowly started kissing his way up my naked thighs.</p> <p>He kissed my pussy and licked my bare skin. He worked his fingers inside me to get me used to them so I could move on them. One by one he teased me. As his tongue danced my hard clit, I almost came again. He lifted it with his lips and sucked then blew gently, like he would blow cold air on my pussy.</p> <p>With my legs spread, he spread my lips and slipped his tongue inside me. He worked it in and out of me but he did it slow and deliberately. It took it out with his tongue and went back inside me. He teased my clit again. I didn't think it would be so good without the tongue.</p> <p>My body began to writhe on the seat. I pushed my hips up towards him to meet his mouth. The feeling was so good. He continued his assault on my clit through multiple orgasms. When I was completely spent, I relaxed into the seat but I still laid there.</p> <p>"Wow!" He said, kissing my thighs and licking my lips. After what must have been twenty minutes, he pulled his mouth away and reached into the back seat of his car to retrieve a piece of paper. "Here's what you can do for me. Take a picture of me. I'm not showing it to anyone" He said when he handed me the picture to take. "You can take a picture with you. Of me if you want." I asked. He put my picture aside and handed me a card. "This means you can take any picture you want." He said in a tone that said, "I'll take pictures of you." And he closed the door.</p> <p>It took me some time to get into the car. As soon as I did, my knees went weak. This was the most incredible feeling I had ever felt. I looked around the room and saw that Mark and Linda were in the back seat. I could feel the air on the open end of my skirt and felt as if a stranger was sucking on my pussy. I could also feel that Mark was sucking on my tits.</p> <p>I had never seen anyone sucking on a man's cock. Never. I had never liked it. Until now. A thought started to form in my mind. If it wasn't for the fact that I was going to get to fuck Mark, what would I do? Would I be able to take a stranger's cock? Even if it did happen, what harm would it cause for me? After all, I don't know how many guys have done that to me, have used my body like that.</p> <p>My mind began to focus. I looked around and noticed the door open and people sitting around the car. I sat there for a minute trying to decide what to do. As I started to get up and walk towards the back seat, I looked back at Mark's face before I got on my hands and knees. I looked back at him. His eyes were locked onto my naked body. I felt his warm hand running across my face as he kissed it. He lifted my chin up and kissed me. It felt like I was falling in to his arms.</p> <p>I felt his mouth travel up my neck to where my cleavage was just inches away. He kissed the line of my collar bone. I wanted desperately to tell him to stop but I couldn't.</p> <p>After a few seconds, I broke our kiss and looked around again. I looked at Mark's face. We kissed again and it felt like it would never stop.</p> <p>Mark got off the seat and leaned back against the back of the seat. I could feel him rubbing his cock against my ass through his pants.
