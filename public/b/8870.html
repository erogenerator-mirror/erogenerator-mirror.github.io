If this was anyone else, I'd want you as well." His words touched me, the fact that she had called me 'I love you' made me cry at that moment.</p> <p>"I just figured, like you said, that if you could keep it to yourself it might help make it more easy for yourself. And, if you could be just the little sister you've wanted all these years, you might be able to finally tell me what you really wanted?" I said, feeling like I was in the middle of a conversation as I spoke. My arms were shaking slightly and I couldn't think straight. "I know you want to see your father. But I need to ask you a question, or two, and you should think, before talking to me.</p> <p>His eyes were hard as I looked at him. He smiled, but it was as if he'd tried to hide the emotions as much as he could. He had an almost apologetic look on his face, and it made me smile. "Of course we can talk. It's a good question, and I'm not as sure as you think. You don't need to be embarrassed, even if I do mean it."</p> <p>"I'm not embarrassed at all. I'm flattered that you like me to think about my dad like that and that makes me feel so special and precious."</p> <p>"That does," He grinned, "As good as it makes me feel. I can always go to him and ask for a picture, and when I can see him, maybe I'll show you how he looks."</p> <p>He stood, "I don't see how I could ever tell my dad like that." His smile was huge, and seemed to have gotten bigger as well. I felt like a different person. I had always felt more comfortable than with that one man who knew I had feelings for him. It seemed like I hadn't had that much effect on him in years. I wanted more than ever.</p> <p>We sat in the parking lot of my brother and I and talked again, about the day we'd seen and done things and his father-in-law and that. We talked a lot, and it had been almost as hard for me as it had been for him. I couldn't help being glad I had gone through all that. I still felt a little bit of my father in me too, but I never thought it would bring out his feelings that way.</p> <p>A few days passed and I was feeling a little sad about that and his mom. When I finally got home, I put a CD in the player to play. It could hardly be called a 'romance' without some 'pop' on it and that was probably what he was thinking. When it was done and the album was in the changer, I grabbed it and put it on my bedside table by the door. A few minutes later, I saw my door open and I walked in. When I moved toward my brother, he said, "I wish we'd thought this out sooner."</p> <p>"Of course we did," He smiled, "but I got to thinking how to move the situation forward so that I could tell you." I heard him rummaging through his clothes in the closet. I walked in and sat down close to him on the couch and he said, "I get the feeling you're wondering why I came out," He smiled at the same time.</p> <p>"How did you get into my father's house?"</p> <p>"Whoa!" Was all he said before turning and walking away.</p> <p>I sat back on the couch and thought for a few minutes, then got up, went into the kitchen and put some drinks on the counter and started making dinner. I hadn't been able to find it in all my mind after the conversation with my father at that club and his idea what I should have made a sandwich.</p> <p>I cooked my steak dinner for me and my brother a couple of hours after we ate itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
