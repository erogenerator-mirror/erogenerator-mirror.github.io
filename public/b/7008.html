We had another light drink after dinner and we continued playing, and I was feeling drunk and horny and, to be honest with you, I was starting to be horny. I kept slipping between him and his arm under the table and I felt his fingers touch my leg underneath the table. As his fingers slid up my thigh and caressed my thigh I let out a long low moan, and slid my leg down to meet him. It was when I looked into his eyes and saw his passion and the desire, as I felt his fingers touch me, he stopped caressing me, and looked down at me, and licked his lips. He slid his fingers under my skirt and gently teased my naked lips, then slid them between my legs, and started to slowly caress me. As my body adjusted, he started rubbing my lips, making me moan and squirm, and then he slowly inserted his fingers into my wet warmth, and started to move them in and out, slowly, not just with one hand, but with two fingers as in, and I felt my wetness on the inside of his fingers.</p> <p>As I sat next to him holding the glass of brandy, I noticed that the waiter was moving to our table, and as he approached, he whispered something in my ear, and I could feel him glance over my shoulder at the waiter, and he quickly moved his hand back, so that the waiter could move away, and my skirt had ridden up his lap. My husband reached over and pulled back my long black dress, leaving the top of one of my tits exposed, as my arms were now outstretched and there were straps for my shoulder straps. He looked at me, and said something to the waiter. Then he took my shoulders in his hands and helped push back my shoulders. With the dress and straps back, my tits were thrust forward, but the top of the dress did not cover them completely. I shimmied out of the straps to show the top of my tit, and he took the top off my shoulder and I let the bra fall to the floor, leaving my tits naked and available. I leaned over the bar and looked over my shoulder at the waiter and then gave him one of my luscious tits. He took it in his hand and began to suck it, and I gave a small gasp when his tongue touched my nipple. When he got up to my other tit, he said something to the waiter and then slid his hand back under the table, and then down my leg, and caressed my thighs, which he stopped for a few moments, then slipped his fingers down inside my wet pussy.</p> <p>I moaned as he started to gently rub my clit and move his fingers in and out of my body. I was moaning and moving as much as I could.</p> <p>I looked around, and saw that the waiter was now looking at the whole show, and looking around, he smiled and licked his lips. Before taking off his clothes, he looked back at me, and smiled as I looked up at him. I leaned over, and ran my tongue over his lips, and then down to where his cock was sticking out there. I wrapped my hand around the base of his cock as I licked the tip, and ran my tongue up and down the underside of the head, and then took that head between my lips, and started to suck it. I felt the waiter's hands run through my hair as I sucked on his cock.</p> <p>I heard the waiter say something to the waiter, and the waiter came back with the waiter's plate, saying something about a bottle of brandy, and then the waiter slid his cock out of his pants as he came over to the bar and poured the brandy through the glass. From my vantage, I could see a big smile on everyone's face as the waiter handed me the glass, and I took a drink.</p> <p>He handed me a glass, and I took a sip, feeling the brandy warm my stomach as I took my glass. I took another sip of brandy and as I was watching, I leaned over to the waiter, and we both took our glasses off and set them down next to the table.</p> <p>The waiter said something to the waiter. The waiter got up, turned around, and slid his cock back into his pants until it was out of his pants. We set our glasses of brandy on the table, and picked up our napkins, and we started to clean up. I felt someone on the chair across my legs as I leaned over to pick our napkins up. By the way, it felt funny, since I had no panties on underneath my skirt, which was up so high. As I leaned over to pick up our napkins, the table cloth was coming to and my skirt had ridden up my thigh and I could feel the man's hand rubbing myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
