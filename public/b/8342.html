"Oh yes, I'm going to miss this."</p> <p>"I'm so excited for this," she said reaching up and lightly caressing each breast one of its full size, the tips barely covered by tiny white satin ribbons of course so thin now but the nipples so large, so pink and perfect and I leaned down to one and licked one, my tongue slipping down under the tiny top and she raised up a little shiver went through her. She was so delicate to touch and her skin so soft and I wanted more, I just wanted to suck and lick her sweet pink fleshy lips as if it were a sweet champagne; her juices making it all the more delicious.</p> <p>I got up between her legs, my erection rising just a little as I moved the head up and down the insides of her thighs. I was so hard, so excited it was hard to think even just one thought. I wanted to please her for as long as I lived; I didn't want anything else than to have her now and in the future and I wasn't going to take it wrong. "What I mean," she said leaning into me, her fingers gently rubbing my chest, "is that I know it wasn't easy but you'll find out that you're just what I think you are. You're smart and thoughtful and sexy and full of desire and desire and everything you want is wonderful."</p> <p>All I could think of was how pleased I was that this woman could find this all attractive; how much I'd loved it when we'd been together and we'd always had the fun of making love and enjoying each other's company. But not today. Not yet because we had to pick up the kids from school at 9:30 that day and go to this special place. "Oh no," she said, "we have to hurry!"</p> <p>I lifted her legs in the air as I laid my body down and slid over her, her legs coming back up around my hips, and we fell into each other's arms. We kissed, our hands moving gently, our lips meeting and the first kiss came again, like a bolt of lightning through a thin sliver of light. Her body was so soft. Her hips lifted up and her thighs opened wider to invite me inside her. We kissed again, lips pressing, our tongues flicking. We broke apart and held each other, our hands slipping to feel, our faces close as we stared into each other's eyes. I lifted her legs up again, her knees coming to my shoulders and I knelt before her and with my knees spread wide she had an even better view of my throbbing erection, so hard and ready, her face almost touching the floor. Her mouth dropped open and she was breathing through clenched teeth and her body shivered from the feelings of me inside her. "Oh my, that beautiful hard thing, I can just imagine how it must feel and feel now. And, oh yes, that's it, just hold me, hold me, squeeze me I need you to give me all of you," she gasped. I lay down next to her and laid my head on her thigh, our lips still pressed together and our breathing coming in quick shallow gasps. I wanted to kiss her again.</p> <p>I moved over to the night stand and opened the drawer and found what I was after, soiled and so beautiful. In her sleep, all I needed but to find a fresh condom, a tube of lube, the day's supply of lube in all those things must be good, must be good for her, must be good for our lovemaking. I pulled it from the drawer, pulled on my shorts and slipped on my shirt, my eyes staring at her eyes as I put it on. She came to me looking in me.</p> <p>"What are you making for dinner?" she asked.</p> <p>"A glass of wine," I replied. "There's no rush."</p> <p>"I can make you come again," she said. "A lot if you like. I bet you'd like to come with me," she added as she reached down and cupped my erection and kissed the tip with her whole mouth, licking some of my precum that had escaped from the corner of her mouth. "I could make you come really hard," she added with a smile. "I could make you come as hard as I want." As she was saying this, she slid her hand inside of her skirt and rubbed herself again, her thighs parting her skirt and exposing her hand and her pink sex. "But I wouldn't be doing anything if I didn't like to, I just wouldn't," she added, "And I promise,"</p> <p>"I think I understand," I said, thinking back to what we'd been about to do so many times before and how I knew I wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
