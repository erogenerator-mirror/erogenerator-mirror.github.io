I asked.</p> <p>"Well, you're still on the bike." I looked at his crotch. "It seems that you're ready to go."</p> <p>He smiled like a kid on Christmas morning, but I knew his eyes were still on my chest.</p> <p>"No," I said, "I like going on the road, but we have to stop off the main highway at the next stop. Just to let you know, there will be a line waiting for you next."</p> <p>"No, I'll be ok."</p> <p>"It's not so?"</p> <p>"No," I said. "I just wanted to be sure."</p> <p>I stood up, and as I did I lifted the hem to my hips so that my jeans were right on top of my panties, showing off the thin material covering my hips but not the whole of my lower legs. He stood up and looked me up and down, his eyes getting as hot as my body, and he had a funny expression on his face that was probably a combination of embarrassment and anticipation.</p> <p>"You look gorgeous," he said. "But, there is one thing that I don't think you were able to accomplish with those jeans."</p> <p>He slid his hand against my hip and down my leg. When he got his hand just where I wanted it, he rubbed me back a bit, spreading my thighs in his hands.</p> <p>"There, that wasn't so bad," he said. "There's one more bit of it that I was unable to get past, so you better get back to work. I'm not going to take advantage of you after all."</p> <p>I stepped out of my pants while he was saying goodbye, giving him one more glance before dropping my panties. He smiled at my underwear, then turned back to the road.</p> <p>"You're not trying to steal me off, are you?" I asked.</p> <p>I walked around the front of him until we were both on the shoulder. I leaned in and wrapped my arms around his neck, my face buried in the side of his neck as I nibbled and sucked on his neck. I felt him tense just a bit and his hands ran up and down my back in a gesture of thanks and encouragement.</p> <p>We reached the entrance to the main road and got out. "This is my stop, and you're on my bike," I told him.</p> <p>He took my hand and we walked on. We climbed down the ramp and made our way towards another side of a large forest at the end. It was one of those places where your foot slides open in front of your brain and you know that something important is about to happen. He parked the car and we walked towards the main building to see what it was that we had come to see.</p> <p>"This is right," said one of my regulars from the store, "I was walking with my mom today."</p> <p>"Hey, it was my mom," I responded. "My dad was coming out of the door."</p> <p>"He's going to beat off to some sexy MILF when he sees you naked," he added.</p> <p>"You aren't so old that you'll pass for his daughters," he chuckled, "but he's a hot number and I've always wanted to see you naked."</p> <p>"Good, good." I picked up the jacket and draped it over his wrist. "Do you want to see me naked?"</p> <p>He hesitated, and turned bright blue and took a step towards me.</p> <p>"Take it off," I whispered with a smile. "Take off your clothes. If you want to, you can."</p> <p>He hesitated, but looked me up and down again. After another few steps I stopped to watch as he took off his shoes and socks. He removed his shirt and undershirt, then dropped his jeans. I noticed that he was wearing a belt around his waist; it made no difference whether he was wearing socks or not. He kicked his underwear off and stood naked on our back porch.</p> <p>"Wow," said one of my regulars, "You really are a hot number."</p> <p>"Thanks," I said.</p> <p>He turned to me, looking back and forth between my eyes and my chest. Suddenly, I felt a warmth between my legs that I had not felt in over a decade. I felt as though I was in a trance as he began unbuttoning his pants. In no time at all he was naked, and I felt my insides begin to move. I stood up, then walked around to where I was standing. I pulled my top over my head, then threw it on the ground. My breasts jiggled as I let go of them, allowing them to fall free.</p> <p>"Wow," he repeated.
