I whispered into his ear.</p> <p>"I want to go now!" he answered, his eyes shining with pride as I pulled him out of the water.</p> <p></p> <p>I got a towel and cleaned him up after he had been lying down in his own water. Once he had gotten out of the water, I dried him off, and then led him out to the pool. He saw that I was naked and had a big grin on his face, when we got back into bed.</p> <p>When he was dry the water stopped. "So where are we going?" He asked, smiling as he kissed me.</p> <p></p> <p>We started out of the pool and came out of it in a swim suit, both of us grinning at each other. "Have you ever been on a date with someone?" I asked.</p> <p></p> <p>"Not that I know of," came the shy reply.</p> <p></p> <p>"Neither of us will be any more awkward with our date than I am," I told him. As we got out of the pool and wrapped our arms around each other, he put his hands on my back, and led me into the house. As we walked, he leaned down and put his lips on mine.</p> <p>Once inside, I closed my eyes, and kissed him back. He put both hands on my shoulders, and pushed me up against the wall. He put his arms around me, my body molding into his. I felt his hardening cock resting between, and through his robe as we made out, before letting go long enough to slip out of the room and down to the basement laundry room, where we found a bag with some hot water on the counter of a hot-tub. He told me to make him a drink, and while he took it from it, he sat down at his computer, then turned to me.</p> <p></p> <p>"Want to share a bath?" He asked.</p> <p></p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p></p> <p>I got down in the tub with him, and we were both getting some good loving from the water. After kissing him in the tub for awhile, I started stripping him, and he was hard. I got off the tub, and then got on my knees in front of him. I sucked on his soft, warm cock, and then started licking on the head before sliding my wet mouth over it. Then I slowly took him down my throat, as his hands came up and went under the water to my tits.</p> <p></p> <p>"Hmmmm I like that," I told him as I moved to his balls to lick them. I started at them, and lightly bit them as I took each into my mouth one at a time. When I was done sucking on them, I went back down to his shaft, swirling my tongue around the head as I went back to sucking on it. When I got to the tip, I lightly bit it a little before letting it go and giving it one more lick. Before we got to the head, I took it in my mouth and slid it as far in my mouth as it would go. Before I went further down, I slid it to the back of my throat, swallowing as it went. After several attempts at swallowing, I could get the tip back in my throat. I pulled back a little, letting it slide out, then back in, and this time went a little further, until I could feel the end of it against the back of my throat.</p> <p></p> <p>"That feels so good!" He praised me as I deep-throated him.</p> <p>This time, I lifted my head up slightly, allowing a couple seconds to go by before I got him to thrust his cock into my throat again with that little move. I started humming on his head, while I started pulling the water from his ass, and licking up the side, before sliding the water off him to the side. When he had come up to the back of my throat, I took him down again, just a little further.</p> <p></p> <p>"This is nice," I told him as I got to the tip, again swallowing, again holding him close to the back of my throat. After a while of this, I let go a couple of extra long licks for him to come up again, and held his rod just outside the back of my throat.</p> <p>"I like the way it's tickles, doesn't it," He complimented me. I lifted off his cock and dropped to my feet.</p> <p>"You know that you've got a lot of time to make up for it," he said to me as he started stripping his own robe off. He had on a pair of jeans and a T-shirt that I could tell didn't leave much to the imagination. "I'll have to get cleaned up first."</p> <p></p> <p>He took his wet clothes off the rest of the way out of the bathroom, and climbed back in theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
