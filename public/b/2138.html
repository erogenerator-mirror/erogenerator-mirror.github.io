"Oh, you're .... so .... perfect."</p> <p>"Oh yes," Jodie purred as her body quaked, and then, as she opened her eyes just in time to see Jodie's eyes roll back in her head.</p> <p>"So beautiful," she whispered, and she kissed her neck again, then, the way she often kissed her lover, lips moving at the base of her throat, took her shoulder gently in hand, but at the same time, rubbed the flat of her finger ever harder against that spot on the upper side of her breast.</p> <p>Finally, like some unyielding animal, she felt the same way, as Jodie moaned softly, almost too softly.</p> <p>"No, no," Jodie said as her body tensed, her eyes still closed and her face still pressed flush to the bed. She was still feeling something else. She could see something in the mirror, but at the same time she was feeling something else, somewhere else, too, even though she herself was too numb and too numb for her own good.</p> <p>"Jodie...I'm .......I'm ...."</p> <p>Jodie's hand froze in her own, and she could only imagine what it must look like.</p> <p>But in that mirror she saw the face of the woman she had known for a very long time, the woman who had haunted her dreams until it was too late, so much the older, more beautiful of her two, much like she was at that most beautiful of moments and it didn't matter. There was no need to ask her to tell.</p> <p>"Just...just let me go. It's ok. Jodie, you can go," Jodie whispered. "Just let me go."</p> <p>"Alright," she whispered again, and she moved from beneath her lover's arm.</p> <p>Grying eyes focused on something, and she opened them again, blinking in surprise. This time, when she saw it, she found herself staring at a full, thick bush, a thick bush, an exotic bush.</p> <p>Not wanting to be caught staring, she closed her eyes and focused them on the face on the bed, staring at her.</p> <p>"It's ok, Jodie," Jodie said and, when she saw her eyes reopen, saw herself reflected in the mirror, saw the face of her own lover and saw hers reflected in the mirror and saw it looking back at her.</p> <p>"Jodie," Jodie said, and Jodie realized that she was looking at her friend. "You can go."</p> <p>She knew she could. Jodie knew she could do it too, but what could she do...she couldn't help it.</p> <p>There was no other alternative.</p> <p>She closed her eyes again and looked back at the man with her eyes and her mind drifted away from everything and everything that had happened in the last day.</p> <p>She didn't have to find this man's face in her mind; it couldn't be any other way to be anything else.</p> <p>There was a strong, strong, strong chance that she could find the man in the mirror and he had found her there.</p> <p>She knew that she wouldn't just have to stay here. That's just what she wanted. To be alone with herself after all they had gone through. The things going on in her mind were all very hard to overcome and they would be hard not to do.</p> <p>"Oh my....Jodie," she moaned as her eyes closed, lost in the moment and their moment. "Why do I feel like I've waited this long."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>"Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
