I asked, trying not to sound too eager. I didn't want to have to explain myself to anyone.</p> <p>"We don't know. All of us. Do you know what's going on?" I couldn't believe what I was saying. I couldn't believe how far the whole thing was coming.</p> <p>"No. I haven't said a good word... I'm sorry,"</p> <p>"I'm happy for you," she said with a big smile. "I don't mean to sound like an asshole, but I'm not sure I want to be a part of your group. I was thinking we could talk to a little more. But I don't think you'll be leaving us alone for very long."</p> <p>I couldn't believe I was here with her. I didn't know whether to be angry or flattered. I was going crazy here. I couldn't think about anything with her except how great it had been.</p> <p>"It's not my fault that you're here..."</p> <p>"Are you afraid to leave?" she asked. "Haven't you seen the photos already? Did you recognize any of the other two?"</p> <p>I couldn't speak but just nodded my head yes.</p> <p>"Have you ever done it before?" she asked.</p> <p>"No. I only went to one place to practice in college," I answered. "It was a bit risky, but not really all that bad."</p> <p>"Did you like it?"</p> <p>"It was great," I said. "It was a lot easier than I remember. I never realized I could do that."</p> <p>"Would you like to go to a strip club?"</p> <p>I was so fucking mad. The thought of her stripping off her clothes and dancing around my cock turned me on. I just looked at her and smiled as I said, "Sure!"</p> <p>"Oh, I'm serious," she said when my eyes met hers once again. "Do you really want to go to a club with me?"</p> <p>"What?" I asked. "That is so crazy. I don't believe, well, you can go, but I'm not sure if I want to..."</p> <p>"No," she said. "You just need to make a decision. You have to make your own. No one has a clue how to do this."</p> <p>"That's okay. I'm not worried. I'll just be doing whatever you ask."</p> <p>"And what's it going to be?" she asked. "I can tell you right now that I really want this, but that we're not trying to make an orgy. It's not even an orgy in the scheme of things, but we'll do it together. You think that's a bargain?"</p> <p>"Yes," I answered. "But why?"</p> <p>"Because you're going to be the center of attraction at The Club! There's going to be a lot of touching and flashing going on there," she said. I couldn't believe how exciting the thought of being at The Club with her was.</p> <p>"You're kidding? You're actually going to let me watch your boyfriends on that huge cock?" I exclaimed.</p> <p>"I know. I'm so excited. You are so beautiful," she said and she was right. There was going to be a lot of touching going on there when we left. The whole time she was telling me about the strippers and how they looked at me with lust for me and then they put me on the floor and stripped me naked like this. I had to do a double take. They had to really strip off their clothes. And that was just the wrong thing to say because I was staring at them too.</p> <p>"The whole time you were telling me about it, and then about the time you and your boyfriend got together, you started getting really excited," she said. "Now, you've got to show me some control. We're just going to dance a little bit and see what happens."</p> <p>"No, I don't think that's going to happen. It won't change anything between us, okay?" I answered with enthusiasm mixed with doubt.</p> <p>"But I just need one more thing and then we're done," was all she said.</p> <p>"Fine..." I responded. "I'll give you that much if you give me a little bit of what you got tonight."</p> <p>I told her it was worth a shot. So I said, "If you say so, but you won't be joining in this group. I'll be there with you, but no touching. I'll be naked all night while you watch, including any nudity. Sound fair?"</p> <p>Again, she was serious. "Of course, but I will be the one to make the first move," she said. "It is the same deal. I'm not leaving without one lastâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
