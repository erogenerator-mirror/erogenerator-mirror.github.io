"I'm so glad you're not getting any of that tonight, anyway," she looked up at me. "So, what's the rest of you been up to?"</p> <p>I glanced around the room. I'd thought Sam had gone to get a drink to watch the fireworks, but when I looked over to the dancefloor, there was an empty place next to us. Then I noticed what she was carrying, and it looked like she had dropped it on the dance floor. Then I looked again at the table. It had been arranged, so there was only one place to sit. So I went across to it and sat down, figuring I'd get the second beer I didn't need on my first one. Suddenly, a guy sitting next to me yelled a quick and loud tune, to which I quickly corrected him (I couldn't tell if he was playing that particular game or if he actually was playing it). I looked over and they both looked up at me, and with a quick glance said it. They both gave me quick glances as well to get the details, and with a shrug of their shoulders said "I thought the second beer would be easier to order."</p> <p>"Oh, okay," I said, as I got up to get my order. "This might not be that bad," I said to the bartender.</p> <p>"Oh, no, no, sorry, man," I heard the guy as he handed the last of the beer to me. "I was just showing you what I could make from the menu, you know, because you might be interested in paying for both, and you might have to wait until the bill's supposed to arrive, but if it does, you can leave. I won't ask anything of you, but just let me know where both of you are if you need anything later. The guy next to me is in charge of everything right now."</p> <p>He handed me the order to come and stand behind the guy as I ordered. When he got our orders, the guy next to me reached up to the bar to look around. I guess he must have seen us, because he said "What are you offering from an empty table, then?"</p> <p>Sam said "I don't do it for the guys. They pay for themselves, like I said. But then, if we don't do it, then the other guys take their money like I said. We all get the same kind of discount. We don't charge you anything. But then, once you come over and buy our food and drinks. You guys get free drinks all the time, right?"</p> <p>That made them all just smile a bit. "Yeah, it does have an occasional cost," the man beside me said. Both Sam and I looked at him, still grinning. "I guess it's a price you don't really have to pay," the guy behind Sam said.</p> <p>"I thought the guys in charge pay for themselves?" I thought that was very clever.</p> <p>"Oh, you just can't imagine it, you dumb bitch," Sam said to me. "This is the only place we have to go with our money, but if you like, we can go to the little bender next to the restaurant that's been open. It might be an advantage to be able to spend a fair amount of time by themselves."</p> <p>"I'll pay it all, you fucken' bitch," I snarled at her. After I'd said it, she'd turned serious. "Okay," was all she said.</p> <p>The guy at the bar smiled at me. It was a smile, but not one of disgust or hurt. It was an honest smile, and he wasn't being malicious or condescending. A little better than my 'little' bender!</p> <p>The guy at the bar got his orders, and I followed my boss's suggestions. He told me I could pay up front, and that I should wait for the food and drinks, even if it wasn't a lot. I thought I'd like to try that, but a few minutes later, Sam came over and sat down across from another guy who'd been looking at me as we were chatting.</p> <p>"All right, I'll go ahead and get the food," Sam said, nodding to me. With her arms crossed over her torso, her legs curled slightly, and she looked very casual with everyone sitting there. "You'll let me take care of the drinks here, right?"</p> <p>One guy was laughing with a smile, and the other guy had a big grin on his face. Sam wasn't sure what he was laughing about, but for whatever reason, I got the message. The guy to Sam's left had his hands in his lap as he waited for his order. He wasn't laughing, though, because by now I'd realized what he was laughing about and how much I was enjoying it.
