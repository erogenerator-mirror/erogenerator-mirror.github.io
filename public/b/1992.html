If our relationship was not totally safe – especially when it came to my husband for some reason – we were more worried about the safety of our careers and maybe the chance of another heartbreak. Or if she didn't feel safe enough in the house anymore. That, and for reasons I didn't understand, we were both glad that we knew how different we were going to grow out of this.</p> <p>In answer to questions, we began to kiss. When we kissed, I felt a little awkward at first, but when we were in our hotel bedroom and her lips were soft and eager, it was easier. Her lips would part and I would push back a little, then I would kiss again. Each kiss became a little more intense, and I felt myself falling deeper between her lips. We didn't want to stop.</p> <p>Her kisses were soft, sexy, and full of desire. I could tell she loved sucking my tits and nipples. She also loved kissing my pussy. Our kisses were just the perfect mixture of passion and desire.</p> <p>When we finally broke apart this time, she looked at me and smiled. She kissed that deep again, then she looked at the clock on the nightstand.</p> <p>"Honey, time's up. I got to go now."</p> <p>She grabbed her clothes then looked at me and shrugged her shoulders. "I still like to play by my nature!" she joked as she grabbed her things. I grinned at her and she returned to the bedroom.</p> <p>I lay in bed, holding my heart, listening to the sounds of the shower, and trying to be calm and be alone. I couldn't believe that I was actually in love with this girl. I was just trying to protect what was mine. Maybe I could be honest about it now, because if this is what love feels like, then I would love for her to be honest. For her to even think that she was capable of the things I was going to say.</p> <p>Later that night, I began to put on my clothes when I heard the doorbell ring. I wondered who it could be, and before I could make up my mind, it was the front door and a man's voice, then the sound of his voice.</p> <p>"Ahhh, this house is getting more crowded," he said.</p> <p>I was shocked. What in hell was he gonna do? I knew a lot more than he did about how much I liked to suck cock. He was very good at it, as was I. I couldn't explain, of course, just yet.</p> <p>As he walked into the bedroom, he said, "Hi, this is Dave, my manager and..." he pointed at my outfit. He looked at me and I saw a look of horror on his face.</p> <p>I tried to pull my mind away from what he had just said. I wanted him to get that message out. I'd done exactly that.</p> <p>"Well, you look pretty good." He smiled at me.</p> <p>"Well, you should see what this hot woman saw when she came over this morning. She was all smiles, so damn beautiful, I could have used a little more."</p> <p>Dave had his shirt off, revealing a perfectly toned chest. Her eyes lit up as she ran her hands over his shoulders and chest. She ran her lips over his shoulders. He reached under her shirt and cupped her breasts, pulling her closer.</p> <p>My nipples were so hard that they were almost painful. It felt like they had a life of their own. This was so wrong, so wrong.</p> <p>I felt myself getting weak in the knees. I knew I had to move or I was going to fall right on the floor. I needed to get up and run, fast, and hide. I didn't even think it mattered right now. She was hot, if not for the fact that we were out in a hotel room, dressed as sexy and sexy as I was. This was wrong, but so wrong that it just felt so right. I couldn't do this.</p> <p>Then I heard her zipper being unfastened, and he slid up to kiss her lips.</p> <p>They went at it, kissing and groping each other. She undid his pants, taking each of his pants with the pants. She was kneeling on the bed, naked, her dress bunched up around her waist. She was so incredibly gorgeous, so beautiful. I never wanted this to end.</p> <p>She slid his cock out, rubbing it over her wet pussy. He kissed her and rubbed her clit. As I have said, she is really attractive.</p> <p>She pulled him down on top, kissing his chest. Dave licked and nibbled her tits, and then sucked and bit them. He was a really good lover. He was a good lover.
