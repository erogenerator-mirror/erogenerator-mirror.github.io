Her hand slipped off his dick and she pulled him down to her, kissing him, tasting her pussy. Her body was warm and silky against his, sliding sensuously against him. He pulled her down against him, burying himself inside of her with an impassioned, grinding kiss.</p> <p>She lay beside him, her eyes closed, her body so taut for him as she moved. "I like this," she said, breathless. "I like everything you do." He kissed her chin, her lips, and her ears. "I like being inside you."</p> <p>"Mmm," she said. "I like this too. You're just perfect, you know?" She ran her fingers over the lines of his shoulders and down his back.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful," he whispered.</p> <p>"Me too," she murmured. "If you had your way, anything you wanted, I'd do the same thing to you." She kissed him, then rubbed his torso.</p> <p>"You can do this to me as well, if you liked," he said. "You can't touch me without wanting to." He kissed her cheek, her chin, and the inside of her left breast.</p> <p>"Mmm," he said softly. "Just like that." She kissed his chest, then moved down to his stomach and belly button. "It's amazing," she said, licking his navel and then his balls. She kissed them with her tongue and then licked the tip of his dick. "And if I knew you had this," he said, kissing her, "you would do anything for me."</p> <p>She pulled up on first one ball, then the other, and licked his shaft with her tongue before sucking his whole dickhead into her mouth. "Mmm," she hummed. "Can you do that to me, too, when we make love?" she asked. He laughed, pushing her back onto her back. She spread her legs wide, and his body slid down her body. He kissed her navel, her pussy, her thighs, and her stomach as his mouth neared her.</p> <p>"It's good, baby," she said, opening her eyes and smiling. He kissed her thighs, her pussy, and her tummy and her breasts. He kissed them and her stomach, and her breasts. Kissed her, he licked her, and he was inside of her. "Ooh," he gasped. "It's so good!"</p> <p>He loved it, she loved it, and it made him crazy for her. It caused his dick to come more blood. It made him want her like no one else could. He thought about her beautiful breasts and then leaned down so they crushed on his mouth. His hands roamed all over her body, from her nipples to her belly, to her ass. He kissed her pussy and her clit.</p> <p>"Now I want you to see," she said, smiling. She pulled him up to his feet. "I want to put you on the bed so we can be together." They kissed long and deep, and she ran her hands all over his body, enjoying his skin, feeling his arms, his legs, his chest. Finally, she climbed on the bed, and lifted his body so he was lying on his side with his torso resting just above hers, on her right side. With her legs spread wide, she leaned over him and they kissed. His penis was hard and wet inside her, and he rubbed his cock against the cleft of his own cheeks. He loved her and he wanted to make her happy. This meant his dick needed a little more loving. He rolled on his back and pulled her on top of him. He slid his hands all over her body, feeling her ass and her breasts in their cleavage.</p> <p>While her nipples played between his fingers, he kissed her neck, her lips, her chin. He sucked her skin in his mouth until it was glistening with his saliva and his dick was hard. He kissed her nipples, her stomach, and her breasts and her neck. He kissed and lightly bit her breasts. "Ooh, like that," she said. "Mmm."</p> <p>After kissing her neck for a moment, he moved his lips down to her shoulder and then down to her left breast without letting her nipple escape from his mouth. He kissed her soft skin where her shoulder and the soft swell of her breast. He squeezed his cock harder and started to slide himself over the top of her right cheek. He lifted himself up on one arm so she could watch him. She moved her hips to make him slide the head of his penis over her cheek, and she watched his face as it rose andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
