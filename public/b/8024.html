For some reason she felt so much more secure. "This is such a weird day."</p> <p>"It's a weird place," I said as we walked down to the river again.</p> <p>"Yeah," she replied, "It's...it's great!"</p> <p>"And all the people here."</p> <p>"It is, but...well...just different."</p> <p>"Well," I said as we walked through the woods again down the river, "it's a very different town. But you...you'll love it."</p> <p>"Why can't we do something about that?" she asked. "We're too young to get into something too embarrassing."</p> <p>"So you're not a virgin," I laughed as we passed by another big tree on the bank.</p> <p>"I didn't say that," she laughed, "but yes, I'm not."</p> <p>"It's still weird," I said.</p> <p>"What?" she asked.</p> <p>"Nothing," I admitted, "I mean..."</p> <p>"No, no, not that," she said. She looked me in the eyes, trying to read my expression. I could feel her nervousness even though she was actually considering going through with it. "Besides...this might be fun!"</p> <p>"Yeah, the weirdness might not be fun," I replied. I glanced around again and saw the other people walking around out in the open too. I felt a little strange that we were being watched out here by an old couple in their 50's - and as far as I could tell, they were probably the last people on the park. Even though we were the only ones there in full daylight. They definitely weren't the last to enjoy the outdoors. It didn't bother me one bit.</p> <p>I turned back to her and she gave me a little smile that lit up her face. I had a hard time remembering what I hadn't done to her when we were out in the open on a picnic on a warm sunny day. I knew that maybe I should probably tell her all of this, but for some reason I really didn't want to. I wasn't sure I wanted to do anything that would ruin our friendship. But then again, maybe it would ruin our marriage. I knew that there was no such thing as a marriage. It wasn't really something she really liked. We had a good life together. As sure as I could remember, we had a good friendship. However, as far as I could tell she didn't really like me at all - maybe...I don't know. And I could be such a selfish asshole thinking that way, but just as sure I could have my fun with her like I was going to.</p> <p>But we were going to spend the remainder of the day out here alone. I was having a hard time keeping my mind on the fact that someone was just walking by our campsite a few minutes away. Not only that, but we would definitely have to be out by sunset if this ever went anywhere.</p> <p>We walked up to the edge of the clearing a little more and found a big stone picnic table that was about six feet high when I first walked through the gate. The table was just a little smaller than where it usually was, but if I had been a foot shorter someone probably would have been able to walk that far. I looked around nervously as the rest of the park made their way over the top of the stone. If we were all out by sunset we were walking through a relatively deserted park, I thought. Why would we have to be...in the woods.</p> <p>As we walked across the clearing I looked around. I couldn't help but wonder if we'd really go all the way back to her room and just get naked on the picnic table. I'd certainly have to be careful if she was going to do that though. I was sure if we were actually going to get to her room and fuck that night I'd be too aroused to care about that. It was pretty obvious what she was thinking. She wouldn't even notice if we were actually going to do that. Plus, I might think of something. The more we went, the more I looked around the park. This was really strange. But I could feel my cock straining to press hard against my pants and was willing to try anything to go back.</p> <p>I was just hoping it would go back where it started; back to our secret, back to nothingness.</p> <p>We reached the end of the clearing and we continued right outside of her door. She had obviously left her door open, and the fact that we were doing this made this even more interesting. She had certainly left her key on the ledge along the way, and she was standing there at the end by her window. The blinds were almost completely open soâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
