You've had too much fun tonight just to settle down. Now it's your turn."</p> <p>"Yes, I'm a bit drunk," I replied. I'd had a few more shots and I really needed a few more glasses of wine before I could really hold out. I was more than halfway through my last glass, and it would take a little more for me to relax if I was going to do this right.</p> <p>"I know, sweetheart," Laura replied. "You've been through a little worse with being out here alone. But you'll be safe tonight. Relax and enjoy." she said that last part like a teacher having her pupil under her control. At first I was a little scared but the alcohol and the fact that I was sitting on a guy's lap made it seem so right. It also made me want to get more comfortable.</p> <p>I couldn't really see anything anyway, so I closed my eyes and started running my fingers up and down the inside of Laura's thighs.</p> <p>"Here. Let me help," Laura said. I couldn't say anything except that I felt really good. I'd actually been this way for quite a while. My own body had been having more and more of an effect on my mind and soul. Now I was letting the situation develop into the place it had been all along. With a slight hitch in my breath, Laura took my hand and put my fingers right up to her pussy.</p> <p>"I know. I'm wet now, too," she said, "I must be quite comfortable laying here like this with you here in my arms."</p> <p>By now, my fingers were really starting to get into her. Laura spread her thighs further apart and her pussy started opening up and inviting my fingers to explore more. I leaned in and started to lightly kiss her outer labia.</p> <p>"Mmmmmmm," Laura moaned. Her legs were now spread further apart, one even reaching into the space between her thighs.</p> <p>"Let's find out," Laura whispered in my ear.</p> <p>Not sure how she knew me by name, all I can say is that I know why I like to hear that right now. It's like being a little schoolgirl, and all I really wanted to do was let her know that I was interested.</p> <p>Laura gently started rubbing my cheek. "It's okay, baby. Relax for a minute... I'll be right with you."</p> <p>"I'm not... not yet." I said, trying to be gentle with Laura. Even before I finished saying it, Laura's body and my own were moving so softly and steadily that I was afraid I was falling down the hill. My hands were slowly sliding up and down her flat stomach, feeling the firmness of her tummy.</p> <p>"You'll feel better if you relax," Laura said. She pushed me down again and started kissing me. Our bodies pressed together as we kissed, and with one of her legs coming down on my waist, she pulled up and my hand slid inside her panties. I was feeling up her wet slit, and I let two fingers slowly start to slide up and down between her inner lips, and up over her clit.</p> <p>"Come on..." Laura whispered in my ear before turning slightly and opening her legs even more. I slid my hand back up between hers and her pussy. I could feel her juices soaking my fingers. I pulled them out and she let me pull them back in and then started to stroke my fingers.</p> <p>I could feel something rising inside her. I could even feel it dripping down the sides of my fingers. "You're doing it!" she said. "I can feel it too..."</p> <p>At that moment, I felt a sudden shock run across my mind. It was her body. Her body was trying to push itself to meet mine. I couldn't believe it. I just looked over at her and saw her face. I felt as if I were looking straight into the eyes of my own personal best angel. A look of pure joy and contentment.</p> <p>Suddenly, Laura started to cry.</p> <p>I started feeling really bad. I was about to do something that I'd completely given up my whole life. And the fear was the main reason.</p> <p>All I knew is that I was falling for a woman; a woman that seemed like a special someone. "I... I'm sorry we couldn't be, you know, on your own," I stammered.</p> <p>"And then you were all wet, and it was all your own fault," Laura replied. "You really are special, sweetheart."</p> <p>For a long minute, I just felt a sense of shame. All of these years of being so happy with the good times and the bad, it was only a matter of time before I feltâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
