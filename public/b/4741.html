First, as a team, we take care of each other. Second, we are all about doing a job and making sure that everybody does their part, and that all of us are happy to do that. We don't just like to do it, we crave it, and we need it just as much, if not more. Don't get me wrong, we have done that, and it makes us even more comfortable, if you can believe that."</p> <p>"Okay, so do I. So, do I have to answer any questions?"</p> <p>"No, not really. Now, are you ready for the game?"</p> <p>"If you say so."</p> <p>"I'll go find you. See if we can find her while you're doing these things."</p> <p>With that, he was off towards the center of the room, looking for her. The closer he got, the less familiar it became.</p> <p>"Ok, so what is it?"</p> <p>"Remember that game we were playing. You have to come back with us and try to see a piece of the game."</p> <p>Once he had his arm around her waist, he followed her up an aisle. At the end of the room was a table where people stood and watched the game with their eyes. They were looking at her.</p> <p>"And?"</p> <p>"And I like showing her off a little, don't you?"</p> <p>"Yea, I do. Now go along with us, ok?"</p> <p>The people in the room nodded a "yes".</p> <p>"Now, we need you to come with us. And, do come with us."</p> <p>As a few people nodded their agreement, they also nodded with a "yes".</p> <p>They led her down a long hallway and into a room with a small stage in back. The lights started dimming and everyone stopped dead in their tracks.</p> <p>"Ok, first of all, I don't know where the hell she got into, but I know where she got into it. And, she's good at it. I mean, really good. She's got the most amazing talent. That's why she got a Master's degree, right? She got one, and one hundred fifty dollars, right?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Yes, I heard there were no Masters in this city. I'm sorry, but we know you know that. She must be worth more than that."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"There are no Masters in this world."</p> <p>"Do you really think you will ever be able to get the job?</p> <p>"If I stay around here for a year, there are going to be Masters in this city."</p> <p>"Then it looks like I don't have to worry about finding one, but, wait a minute."</p> <p>He handed her a pair of very dark sunglasses with the word "CUT" written on the back, with the word "NO" engraved in gold thread. She placed one in her hand and handed it to him. He slid the sunglasses on to her. He smiled at her, and then he kissed her on the cheek.</p> <p>"You really will be good," he said. "You'll feel like a real woman when it happens. Trust me."</p> <p>"You're right. If she goes back to being a woman, you will have to keep her in line."</p> <p>"Yes, I know."</p> <p>"I'm going to enjoy helping you through this, but first and foremost, remember, I only want to do these things. You do not have to have anyone else in this life. That's fine. If you want to be one of the best slaves that ever lived, you will have to do a lot better than that."</p> <p>The first thing that he said to her was to "Do a lot better". He kissed her deeply and began pulling off her clothes, until she was standing in just her shorts.</p> <p>"And," he said, "I really want to be able to go out and fuck you, right here on these people's table."</p> <p>"No, we'll leave that in the morning for you to find. You'll also need to do a lot more than just sleep. You have to find out how to please other women, and make other women happy. It's not easy. But you must. You have to get used to it."</p> <p>She nodded her head and started rubbing her tits. "Ok. It all starts with those glasses. You have to have all of it right away. Right as this party is starting. Now, do you want to go or can you be quiet?"</p> <p>"I just want to let you know. I've been a very long day."</p> <p>"Ok, then, we'll do what you want to do tonight."</p> <p>"OK. I'll do exactly what you say."</p> <p>She reached back and grabbed the glasses. While they were on the stage, they were going back and forth to the beat of the music.
