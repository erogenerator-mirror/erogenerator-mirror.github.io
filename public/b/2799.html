"Can we go somewhere for a bit? I've got this itch to scratch... "</p> <p>I didn't say a word as we walked up the walkway and found our room, as she laid my key on the bedroom door, unlocking it and pulling the cover off the bed as we stumbled inside.</p> <p>"I want to go to a dance," she whispered as she stood up, taking my tie and holding it up as she made her way behind me, undoing the buttons of my blouse as she slid her arms inside to unfasten my bra, slowly pulling it down, pausing briefly with my panties before reaching around to my rear, squeezing each cheek. With each tug, I raised my hips gently in arousal.</p> <p>"So many times lately, huh, baby?" she whispered, a devilish smile on her face as she slowly pushed my knickers over my hips, letting them drop around my ankles.</p> <p>"Mmm, yes... " came my moan as I stepped out of them, laying them on the floor.</p> <p>"You know, those were pretty hard to get, huh?"</p> <p>"Uh, well, kinda, but I've been wanting to do that for the past two hours."</p> <p>"Yeah?" She asked teasingly, turning away from me and leaning back against the doorway.</p> <p>"You're gorgeous, so many things you've done for me..."</p> <p>Her lips curled in a sexy grin, reaching up again, her arms folding under her chin as her hips swayed and swayed under the water until a long, wet kiss followed, our skin mashing together as our tongues intertwined. I felt my nipples harden under the water as our bodies rubbed together, then her hands left mine as the kiss finished, slowly and sensuously slipping her wet panties down over her ass before dropping into the water with a splash.</p> <p>"Oh, god," I moaned as she walked over and stood between my legs, her body looking magnificent as I reached mine to pull her to me, kissing her deeply as she wrapped her arms around my neck and pulled us together once again. Her lips parted as my hands trailed down her body once more, and she leaned down to whisper in my ear, her hot breath against me as she slid down and wrapped her arms around my waist, her tongue pressing itself into my ear in a long, slow lick, a finger slipping inside my slit, making me gasp.</p> <p>Her lips met mine as her tongue slowly began to swirl around mine. As I looked back down at her, my fingers found mine on her breasts, squeezing them at first firmly, and then slowly, sliding over the tips of her hard nipples until one slipped inside them, rolling and squeezing each as my fingers wrapped around hers. Her eyes closed as her hands slid over my back and slid down my sides, sliding round to rub my inner thighs as the water ran over us and made a damp patch at our sexes.</p> <p>"Mmmmm... " she whispered as she slid a finger inside the water, her legs parting as she began to rub herself, her other holding mine, the finger slipping in and out of her as her hips moved against it, her hips sliding against mine.</p> <p>"Shh... don't say a word." She whispered, lifting my hands once again and slipping me back under the surface of the tub, the water running down our legs as she pulled herself up to kneel down on the edge and slowly sank down onto her back on the warm, smooth surface.</p> <p>"I want to do this, baby" she said as I knelt on the end, my hands coming to rest under her hips, holding her against me, sliding myself up and down over her wet body as I kissed her, my hands coming up to her hips as I slowly drew her to me, my lips capturing hers as my hands slid down, sliding over her ass as she came to rest around it, feeling her wetness as my fingers slid inside.</p> <p>I leaned over her, placing one hand behind her neck while sliding the fingers of my other hand in her mouth, taking my time as I did, teasing her tongue with my fingers as I did, my hands pulling her back against my body as her hips rubbed against me, her hands gripping the bottom of the tub as I pulled her against me as our hips moved, our sex sliding as one against each other.</p> <p>I could hear her softly moaning as her lips parted, her tongue slipping out to slide across my lips on the way back.</p> <p>"I've got to..." she started to say as my arms slid round her neck on the other side as I pulled her body to mine, breaking the kiss just to taste more of her.
