Not an evil smile because she knew I was just teasing. I am a man in disguise. A man that needs to be teased.</p> <p>Sitting down in my office and staring into the back corner of my desk, I have a hard time keeping my excitement in check. I could barely concentrate on my work so I just kept turning it around. I am sure that the man sitting across from me was just as nervous. He may have had a nervous breakdown over our little meeting, but at least it wasn't a man with a stiff poker face. He had a look of confusion or disappointment as he continued to stare at her as I sat there in the office looking at my work from two different perspectives. I couldn't help but notice her legs. Her legs were beautifully toned and well tanned from her yoga classes. Her legs where beautifully toned from her swim team workouts. I could easily tell that she had a fantastic pair of legs as if she were running on the treadmill and she would go from one machine to the other so fast but it didn't seem as though she had a body full of muscle. She was a petite woman and her muscles were on solid form and she was very well dressed up while I had the impression that she would be a hot looking model but I couldn't be sure.</p> <p>I guess when I'm nervous about something as she is that I will probably forget to take my eyes off her. I didn't know what I was doing reading her, but she was smiling at me so much it was driving me crazy. Maybe it was the fact that I was looking at her. Was she enjoying the attention? Did she feel the electricity between them? Or was it just about having an unobserved view of her that I couldn't have missed?</p> <p>That last part got me thinking. Maybe it's the look on his face for what it was. Was he looking at her as much for her as for me? I found that to be hard to answer, though. She seemed to be reading my mind. It just seemed as if she didn't want to put the fear of my silence on him. I'm sure the look she has is part appreciation for the job I've done for her.</p> <p>It was then that she turned to me again and asked, "Is everything alright with you?"</p> <p>I was still focused on my work and didn't know what she was asking me. "Yes everything is good. Do you mind if I take a break and we talk a few minutes?" I said that I didn't mind, it would be better if she just left without too much of a fight. "I don't mind at all." I answered her. She sat there trying to find something to say with her voice. I took in the silence. I could hear it, I could almost hear the rustle of her breath and the sound of her hair on her ears in the air. I didn't know how long she was sitting there staring out my office window. Finally she spoke.</p> <p>"I have a meeting with an important client. I need to finish a few papers before we start." She said her last words with that same determined look.</p> <p>"Oh." I said looking at her. Did she hear me? Did she want to talk some more?</p> <p>"Have you ever been with a woman?" She asked me.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"You shouldn't have to answer that if you don't want to."</p> <p>For a moment I thought that she was going to say no. But then I thought that this might be one of the times when she truly needed to know.</p> <p>Without saying a word, she got up and left my office. I was sitting in my office looking at the paper. I could hear it rustling under her heels as she walked toward my office. Her voice was softer from her own nervousness. She turned back and asked me again if everything was fine. I assured her I wasn't upset and that everything that happened was perfectly natural and right. She had the ability to see into my mind if something was bothering me. I asked her if it was alright if she came back another day, that I didn't want to bother her. She told me that she still hadn't decided what to do about seeing more than one other female to see. She explained what she wanted to do and that I could have her back. I told her that was fine. I really would like to try it again with someone as hot looking as her, no strings attached.</p> <p>"That was thoughtful of you." She said.</p> <p>"What do you want to do?"</p> <p>"Would you like to help me with a client and if you're interested, you can watch the client while I'm with him. That would be great I'll get back to you later." She said. And then she just turnedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
