She gasped and her body shook and she came, her juices spraying as she did so. That only encouraged me; I slid my mouth over her and sucked eagerly as she came, my tongue running over her, licking her and sucking her. I could feel our lovemaking and, for a brief moment, realized that she had finally lost her orgasm. And I kissed the top of her pussy lips, her clit.</p> <p>"What do you say we stop?" My mouth covered hers and I sucked and drank the fluids that she was producing. She tasted like cherries but, again, tasted of her. I held her in my arms, kissing her and holding her.</p> <p>"But I have to..." she said. "We don't have much time left."</p> <p>My hands were under her, stroking her as she moved about and, after a moment, my cock was back inside her as it was before. This time I filled her completely. Her pussy gripped me like a velvet fist and she moaned.</p> <p>I wanted desperately to be inside her, but with another woman, I had to be quick to remove my own clothes. I dropped her to her knees and slid my cock into her willing mouth. She didn't gag, she didn't even notice and it was a thrill to finally have a man fuck her mouth. I felt like I could stay in that position for hours, sucking and swallowing and relishing the taste of her. I had to have, but not right now, not with a woman whose pussy I just enjoyed doing it with.</p> <p>But just as suddenly, she took my cock fully into her mouth, almost all the way, and I felt her throat constrict around the head. I was just about to say something about it, but she raised up to breathe a gasp which she quickly took in. I didn't care about words now, in fact, I had just been able to see that what she did was absolutely perfect for her pussy: the feeling of being surrounded by a woman who wasn't quite aware that she was doing what she was doing could be sublime, for the first time a woman, not just doing herself.</p> <p>She took it all, sucking and sucking, taking me into her throat like she was a vacuum cleaner, and the thought of that was almost more than I could bear. She came, I felt her come, and we both knew that the ecstasy we were experiencing was mutual. I felt a flood of emotions but there was no rush, there was only joy. I couldn't even think. She was right. There was also something of sadness to the fact that we had never been so alone together before, only in these little moments of sexual adventure.</p> <p>We lay there, she in our arms, both of us naked, holding on to each other. She reached under herself and began stroking me gently, and I touched her, feeling the pleasure of seeing her face while we made love. It was lovely, but it wasn't the same, I could feel it in my skin where she was stroking me and it felt so good, so sexy to be touching so intimately with another. I loved her body.</p> <p>Eventually, when I felt sufficiently aroused, she climbed onto me and we made love again. This time we were more leisurely, but, to tell the truth, I was still thinking of that moment. I hadn't felt that level of ecstasy as I had with Laura, or as with anyone before. Laura had been doing something to me that I had never experienced until she did it to me. I was still feeling a new level of intense pleasure, feeling what could be achieved in a woman's body, so I enjoyed being with Laura. I had felt a new level of sexual arousal. There was a sense that both sex seemed to be connected at the level that Laura and I had been.</p> <p>We made love a few more times afterward, again in front of the mirror, but this time in front of her face, and it didn't take long for the feelings to surface once more.</p> <p>"That was fantastic," she said after we had showered. "How was the sex?"</p> <p>"It was as good as in the first movie," I replied, "but better than what we have been together."</p> <p>We got dressed, and went downstairs to find some food to eat, and had a rest to ourselves. We chatted as we ate and discussed our sex life and about how we had achieved it. We went our separate ways to bed, me feeling very melancholy about the whole affair.</p> <p>We had a night of pleasant intimacy that evening, our sex coming easily and easily. It was as if we had been sharing something that we had always considered as our only sexual experience. Although we hadn't known that for more than a while, it seemedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
