I said, wondering what else I could say to lighten her mood so I could talk to her about it...</p> <p>"...why are you in such a rush..."</p> <p>"Oh, I don't know. I can't believe I just asked you that!" I sighed, wondering what the hell she really meant when she said that in the middle of that sentence!</p> <p>She looked at my eyes as though she was trying to read the expression on my face, then she looked back to her hand as she spoke. "Do you really have a boyfriend? Or is he your first?" she asked, her sweet tone was so sexy I had to have her!</p> <p>"Well...he..." I said, trying to stop myself from stuttering again! "is...I...not very good at it really, so...um..." But there was barely a second's pause of hesitation before I finished speaking... "he's only...he's a bit...um...very...uh...young..." I said, looking a bit sheepishly at Emma and hoping for a response.</p> <p>"Is he the second one?" Emma asked, her tone clearly implying that she was in charge of the conversation. I tried to speak and even managed to speak after some internal struggle. "Mum! What's the matter? You know where this is going or something! You'll have to ask him yourself!" she teased me and with a quick glance back to her face, looked back to me and said, "Go on!"</p> <p>"Uh..."</p> <p>And that time in which I said it, I actually blurted out more than I meant to. It was like a blur in my mind!</p> <p>"I'm not gay! Oh...I'm not...that...not that..." I said, trying to change my mind.</p> <p>"Oh, dear! Of course you are! Now answer me this! Are you going to let me in?" she asked in a very teasing voice.</p> <p>"No! I'm not gay...um...that..." I lied.</p> <p>"I can tell!" she said in a way that sounded like it was just the two of us! "Well...sure! Go on!" she encouraged, looking me over and smiling at me.</p> <p>I finally got my words out and I turned to look at her and said, "Emma...Emma...I mean....do you know what I really mean?" I looked down at the floor in shock.</p> <p>"Yeah! I know what you mean!" she said with a smile, "Can I have some privacy this time, please?"</p> <p>"Yeah, sure...what time do you want me to leave? I mean, do you....?" I finally asked her, not wanting to sound like a child that had just been given permission to come in the middle of a conversation.</p> <p>"I'm not asking you to...to wait outside for me!" Emma said, "But...if you want me to do it, well...."</p> <p>"I don't want you to leave!" I looked back up at her and said, "You're probably too young to be here!"</p> <p>"No, I didn't say I was twenty!" she laughed, putting her hand on my cheek and putting her hand under my chin. I looked into her emerald eyes and saw that just yesterday, she would have been so serious. But I wasn't that kind of kid.</p> <p>And the first thing that popped into my head was, "Emma, you...you really don't like my face..."</p> <p>"It's okay!" she said, patting my cheek and looking me in the eye once again, "Can we go? The other shoe was on the other foot!"</p> <p>I smiled at her and nodded my head. She looked over at me as though it was just the two of us and waved her hand in the air.</p> <p>I started walking, but when I got near the building that I had just come in, I turned to face Emma. What I just said was the last thing I expected coming from her!</p> <p>Emma was wearing a light summery dress that hugged every curve of her body and was held so tight as to not only hug her ass but also her cleavage, leaving a lot of skin and showing of her midriff.</p> <p>And she had on a bra that I couldn't help but notice. She was just an inch or two taller than me, with short light brown hair, and her body just seemed to have curves to it - some of which could be accentuated by just having her hair on it, but the more time she spent wearing that dress, the more she seemed to have to be the cause of it!</p> <p>She had on a pair grey lace knickers and, even more, a black thong that left very littleâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
