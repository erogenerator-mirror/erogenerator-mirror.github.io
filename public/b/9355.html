She stood with the air of a woman before the mirror. Her hair, now completely free of its confinement, fell over her shoulders in wild unbridled curls down to the center of her back like a curtain. She turned slowly and the long dress flared out around her sex and the curve of her hip. Her chest was a rich dark color of her pastel green that reminded one of an ebony orchid. She turned slowly, the dress revealing the swell of her breasts.</p> <p>She was dressed as a girl; her eyes closed, a thin smile playing across her lips.</p> <p>I've got to stop being such an idiot.</p> <p>"You will."</p> <p>So it was that she stepped out. But, she was still standing. She went over to face a wall and looked out over the crowd. She looked around at them, as if she was a movie star on a stage performing.</p> <p>"This is how you dress yourself, my girl." It was the old adage that came to pass a time or two. For the most part, it had been forgotten. It was not a fancy, expensive way of dressing, but there was never a time when a girl was able to wear just the right dress, a tailored suit, or a casual outfit. She could not really be sure that she would ever wear anything like this in her lifetime. The dress, on the one hand, was pretty, and flattering. But, on the other hand, she was completely naked, and that is all of it. She stepped close to the ground in one fluid motion, the heels clicking loudly on the cement.</p> <p>"Show me."</p> <p>At the end of the street, next to the street lights, she could see a street lamp. She stepped up slowly to the light and looked in the mirror. Nothing there, but she could see every movement of her body. In the mirror, the top of her hips were just a tiny hint of her bellybutton and the curve of a lower stomach, a hollow and hard core of curves and cleft.</p> <p>I never wore clothes like this, she thought. Just a pair of shorts. Even then, they were not tight enough or comfortable enough for this kind of work. I always dressed casual and casual. I wanted to see how well I could dress. But, every time I did it, I was always too late. Now, she was showing herself.</p> <p>She began to move with the speed of a dancer. She swayed with exaggerated movements in the mirror, moving her body rhythmically and slowly, swaying to a music she recognized, but was unaware that she was an actress performing. Then, she pulled on the top of her dress, the bottom part, barely hiding her full breasts, and let the fabric caress the soft curve of her breasts.</p> <p>I can't believe I'm doing this, she thought. I'm letting everyone see all I want to.</p> <p>She felt as if she might cum before she touched it. But, she did not. She wanted more. She pulled the top of the dress over her breasts and let it fall to the ground. The bra straps were like a tent on the backs of her arms, but with the back straps she could still reach the top of the dress.</p> <p>I'm so beautiful,</p> <p>I'm so beautiful,</p> <p>and every part of me is naked</p> <p>It feels so good to be naked in front of people.</p> <p>But, all of my clothes are on the ground and I can see every inch and everything.</p> <p>I love to be naked in public.</p> <p>And, this one thing on which I have always wanted to prove my inner self is how much I love it. With my legs wide open, I look down to see what every woman seeing me is thinking about. And, there is more and more of what she does there. She can feel the muscles inside me tightening up, as if this is what she's feeling; maybe not as much as her body, but more like a connection.</p> <p>I've never really thought about it, so there is just no denying that I have a thing for seeing the world. I have always been shy about my body. Even though I've never said so and it's just been a feeling I've never felt, let alone acted out with an equal amount of enthusiasm. She can look just as easily at my tits as she can look at my ass and I can look at them more naturally.</p> <p>When I don't have tits, I'm not ashamed to take off my bra. My nipples are so sensitive and I know people will be looking at them if I move them. And when I don't want to be ashamed of my tits, I don't worry about whether or not anybody can tell that I'm not wearing a bra.
