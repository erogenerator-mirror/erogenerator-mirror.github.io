He said, as he sat on his towel on a small blanket that was a little high for her.</p> <p>She slid into the water and began swimming laps again, getting out before swimming to the other side of the pool. She got out first and looked at the sky. "I'm sorry about the mess I got in my head. It was all I could not to throw up."</p> <p>"No worries, it's a little after noon. There are no schools, so no one will bother me."</p> <p>"I like it that we can use your beach chair." she said as she started to untie her apron.</p> <p>He stopped her and kissed her softly. He looked in her eyes and spoke to her, "You can join me on the beach anytime you want. I'm always welcome."</p> <p>She just smiled and swam out to the side of the pool, giving him access to the beach and then swimming out.</p> <p>Her eyes kept going back to his eyes, the look in them was one of the sweetest emotions she had received in years. The look of affection and warmth she got from him when he looked at her seemed to grow. Not just in intensity, but in a way as if it were his own and hers. She could feel his eyes on her and it made her nervous. His eyes were as loving as anything she had ever experienced. Their conversation the previous night had been lighthearted but the way he touched his face and kissed his forehead made her feel closer to him, to be his own little girl. "I love you, my sweet." He said softly and pulled her closer to him so her breast were pressed against his chest and he was holding her hips with one hand.</p> <p>She felt her breath quicken, she had been thinking about this very thing the whole time she had been here. She leaned her head on his shoulder, enjoying the closeness of their eyes. She knew if she really were in love with him, she would feel a little better. He held her to him and then kissed her softly. She could feel his erection pressing into her as he held her. She closed her eyes, enjoying his passion and thought how very nice it felt when she finally felt his hands on her soft belly, feeling his strong arms around her, feeling his hands on her back and hips. She wanted him as much as he knew she wanted him. He turned her around and kissed her deeply. She could feel the difference in their sizes between the two of them. She just enjoyed the feel of her breasts being pressed against him and the way his hips rubbed against hers. It was very exciting to be held by him so completely again.</p> <p>He finally pulled her away from his kiss and looked into her eyes. "I've missed you." he said.</p> <p>"I've missed you too." she said as she swam back into the water again.</p> <p>"What is it?"</p> <p>"I don't want you back to school."</p> <p>"I can't say I feel the same way this summer, but it feels different."</p> <p>"I know exactly what makes you different, sweetie." That was all he could say to her and she smiled, loving the words.</p> <p>They swam through the warm sand and then walked back around their pool. She was glad they hadn't bothered to put their chairs together as it wasn't that hard to get comfortable on one of the chaises. She laid back on one of the little lounge chairs she had on the beach and stretched. It felt good to do that. Her back was still as naked as ever. She noticed that his eyes were still looking at her very much as well and that made her feel all better. It made her feel good for some reason.</p> <p>As they walked back to the hotel, they talked and laughed about each day but mostly about how happy they were to be back at school. He had a nice sense of humor and she was glad that he actually enjoyed what they were doing with each day.</p> <p>She leaned back and said, "Honey, we can't stop talking. I feel like it's time we started doing that again."</p> <p>"It's true, I feel good too. How is school going?"</p> <p>"Great, we're graduating."</p> <p>As both of them laughed, she said softly in his ear, "I want to see you again."</p> <p>He smiled at her and kissed her lips again. "I love you too. Thank you again."</p> <p>"You're amazing. This might be just the beginning."</p> <p>"I'm glad. We'll let each other know."</p> <p>They talked for a little longer as they walked over to her room to close up the pool and then she wanted to get some fresh air in the sun. She had a bottle of wine still on the bedside table.
