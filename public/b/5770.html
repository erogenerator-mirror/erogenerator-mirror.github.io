I loved having you in my bed.”</p> <p>“What?” I said, confused. “We never use it. It is only when we get back from lunch.” I stopped her, putting my hand on her. This time I pulled it away. “So what is it you were having with me,” I asked. “You were fingering yourself.”</p> <p>“I’m sorry,” she replied.</p> <p>“No please. That was… different,” I continued. “You know you are the one that’s enjoying it,” I said, putting my arm around her.</p> <p>“I know. I should have left you alone, I guess.” With that she leaned her head into my shoulder. I put one hand over her shoulder. I could feel her relax. We lay there, still for a minute in my arms, neither moving. My heart was starting to thump. I could feel her breath. The next few minutes were filled with the smell of peppermint.</p> <p>“I guess I’ll go back to sleep. I hope not to be able to remember what happened,” I said, pulling my arm free and standing. I left her resting on the couch, her naked back to me. I reached behind her. She was shaking with desire. “I’m glad I made you feel you had a dream,” I said, stroking her arm.</p> <p>We went to bed. I put my arm around her. “If I had a dream like that sometimes, it must have been about you. You were very exciting,” I said. I felt so happy. She kissed me. “I know,” I said. “I had to share it with you.”</p> <p>We kissed again. This time she pulled back a bit. She said something, got off the couch and stood at the side of the bed. I had to lean over and kiss it on the cheek. “I really loved it,” she murmured. I turned so that we could kiss again. She turned and laid her hands on my shoulders. Our lips met again, then again she pulled me to her, our tongues met. I felt her hands move down my body, reaching and stroking my dick. She slid one hand down over my ass and started to stroke it. I moved my hand to hold her wrist, making sure she didn’t touch me. I gently pushed her hand away, moving from the side of the bed as she moved to the side of the bed again. When she got to the other side I started to kiss her again. Her right hand was reaching under my robe and stroking my cock. She was looking into my eyes while sliding her finger along my shaft. My hips rocked into her hand. My orgasm was close. She sensed it.</p> <p>She stood back. I could see her standing there in the doorway. I just said, “Are you OK,” to her. She had a little smile on her face. She reached down, holding my cock against her stomach. She took me in her hand. It was warm; she was not cold. I could feel it running down my shaft, across her stomach. She leaned down and kissed the tip. Running her tongue across the tip, she let go of my cock, moving the hand back down to stroke my ass, moving her mouth onto it. She wrapped her lips around me and worked her head up and down. I wanted to get more; I tried to hold back and hold on to a longer orgasm, but it could not be. Suddenly she pulled away.</p> <p>“I know what you want.” She said. She got back down, now kneeling in front of me. She placed my cock on her lips, running her tongue along it, sucking it. She took me into her throat again, moving her head from side to side. She stopped sucking, and looked at me. I was still on the brink of shooting my load. I looked at her.
