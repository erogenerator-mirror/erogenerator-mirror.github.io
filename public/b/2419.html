Thank you for helping!"</p> <p>I had done it now, in all my naked glory. I held her in my arms, my own hands caressing her breasts, running down her back. I wanted to hold her and feel her bottom, to feel it, to hold her against me, to feel her bare bottom. I thought I had done a good job, if not, maybe, I just didn't know. I had been so sure and so sure that I had done something good this afternoon, at least this afternoon.</p> <p>"You are very, very special to me," I whispered as I squeezed her bottom. "Do you know?" She nodded. She was quiet, still as I'd expected, still in my arms and the world outside it was as soft and wonderful as it had been in a long time. Her breathing became more urgent and her skin seemed to burn in my palm.</p> <p>"Yes, I feel that way, too. Very. Not just with men my own age, perhaps a lot older. But you? You just..."</p> <p>And then I was holding her all the way back into the tub, her arms around me, and she looked up at me, her cheek so close to mine. It was a beautiful sight.</p> <p>"I didn't think you needed to know anymore, did you? I'm not a complete idiot."</p> <p>"I know, I really do mean that."</p> <p>And then she was kissing me! And, just then, we were sitting on the towels, her hands on me, my hands upon her, my lips touching hers. She began to kiss me. Kiss me! We kissed. Our bodies pressed and then we were both standing, and she was taking me in her arms. We kissed! It was an incredible sensation! And, we stood there kissing! She began to undie me and I soon stripped of my shirt. Our kissing was as passionate as it had ever been!</p> <p>"Now this is what I feel, you know, with you. You know how much I love you, and you love me too. Like I always have. I love you for that!"</p> <p>"You're such a dirty old man, you know that? I just love making you feel good. Oh yes, I love that! God, I love you! Just, just, love you!"</p> <p>And so we went on kissing! Kissing! Kissing so beautifully! I couldn't help but take her by surprise all the time, even though it was at times difficult to say what we were doing. She had always been the aggressor, in my mind, and I loved making her do all the work, all the touching, all the kissing. She was the sweet, tender thing, the most special lover.</p> <p>And her sweet body felt marvelous, it felt great to kiss her! And I loved kissing her mouth, I felt so good to French her, all that kind of kissing, the way she did. I found myself kissing her face, her mouth, my lips, her neck.</p> <p>And it began to happen! Our kissing began! Our tongues were dancing and touching! And then I could barely keep my hands on her body! And her kisses were taking on a different meaning! I'm sure I kissed her mouth, and she could really kiss, it didn't matter that I'd never kissed anyone before. What really mattered was that I was kissing her and it felt wonderful!</p> <p>As we kissed, I could feel her breasts press against me, their shape and size as my hands caressed her body. And her long legs were sliding softly along mine. And my hands were working their way down, stroking her bottom.</p> <p>Then I was lifting her completely out of the water. I was holding her against me but she had pushed herself back onto me, as I was supporting her bottom, and her legs were still wrapped tightly around me. We weren't just supporting her—not yet at all. I was kneeling between her legs, her feet on the side of the tub, my face to the side of hers, her mouth to mine. We were standing there in what would be another wonderfully erotic kiss.</p> <p>I could feel her hands running slowly over my body, touching me all over, touching me in all the right places as we kissed. Then she was on her knees bending down and moving between my legs.</p> <p>Then she was on her knees again. I wanted so much to touch her so, but not now. She kept on kissing and rubbing up and down, as my hands were helping her get to her knees.</p> <p>And her hands were on my bottom, rubbing, stroking the cheeks of my bottom! I felt I was getting aroused too. Not by the kiss, although I certainly thought that's what she was doing.</p> <p>Suddenly, her hands took an immediate lead in the way she was touching me and—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
