I wanted to take her right there. As I neared the top of her thighs, I took my hand away. She was flushed and panting!</p> <p>"Please!" she gasped.</p> <p>"Please?" Was all I said. Her face was turned up to look me in the eye, but as I slowly slid my hand up her leg to her cunt, and with one touch she was panting again.</p> <p>I felt her knees come together, but I didn't stop. Her legs were shaking with excitement, and with a few words from me, she pushed my hands away from her, then began to get up. She didn't want to feel this but it wasn't a chore for me.</p> <p>She grabbed the front of my pants and pulled it down to give us room. I kicked off my shoes before she could move away, and as soon as she was off her panties she had me in the middle. We were both naked. She was breathing hard in front of me, and she hadn't even touched me.</p> <p>"This isn't fair, I'm a married woman" I had said</p> <p>"I'm sorry, we've just.... We've both had sex," she said.</p> <p>"Yeah, but neither of us is doing anything we're not willing to do."</p> <p>It didn't make sense to me, but it made sense to her. I was on a high. I was hot and ready to screw. As she began to undress me, and I undress her, we made sweet passionate kisses. At the same time, we were both naked. She was excited, her nipples were hard, and I was hot too. I lay on the bed.</p> <p>"You should take off your clothes, just in case my husband calls" I murmured to her. I had removed mine. I was aching to fuck her. I turned her over on her knees, and as she lay on her back, I quickly removed her bra.</p> <p>"A little cold," I whispered to her.</p> <p>She grabbed her tits, and as I played with them, she pulled down her panties. This time, I was between legs. I began to slowly work her pussy with my thick, long fingers, making her moan. After a few minutes of licking and teasing her clit, I put a few fingers inside of her. I could see she was beginning to enjoy it, and she reached out for me to remove my shirt. She unbuttoned my pants, and I was hard. I pulled down her panties. She wrapped her leg around my waist, and began to run her fingers over my balls, before we kissed again.</p> <p>I was hard. She began to run her hand, teasing me, touching my cock. "I think you have a nice cock." She was breathing hard.</p> <p>"I think you like it. Maybe I'll let you take me home." She was looking me in the eye.</p> <p>"If I promise" she said.</p> <p>"Deal."</p> <p>"But you don't have to do all of the work. I'll finish." I looked her right in the eyes. "You should tell me what you want." She didn't get one iota of an answer.</p> <p>"Please", she whispered.</p> <p>"Please".</p> <p>As the night wore on, my cock was rock hard and in urgent need of release. We made passionate love all night. It was hot and passionate, and neither of us felt like a married couple.</p> <p>The next day, we had breakfast together. After a great breakfast, I asked her if she would like to go out to dinner, at a nearby restaurant, one of many nearby places. This was a way out of a bad situation. It would be an adventure. The thought wasn't necessarily mine, but it was something she wanted to take to a whole new level.</p> <p>"A date?" she had asked.</p> <p>"Sure".</p> <p>"You might want to take me home."</p> <p>My cock was hard as a rock, and I didn't want to stand out from my pants in front of her. "Sure, I'll have dinner and a kiss, then a movie on Saturday night". This meant I could stay behind and be a gentleman and do what she said. It sounded like the perfect opportunity.</p> <p>"OK, I'll be with you in a minute." Then she kissed me and ran off, leaving me a couple of thoughts that weren't very comfortable, to put it mildly.</p> <p>Her pussy was moist down below, and I began to stroke it. I imagined it was her hand rubbing me. I could picture it. I could smell her. I began to stroke myself harder. She was in for a real treat, it seemed.
