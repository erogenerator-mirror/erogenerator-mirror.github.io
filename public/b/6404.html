She really knows how to talk to men."</p> <p>"No she isn't. I have always found her extremely attractive and very easy to look at. I can't quite believe she'd even even see me like this."</p> <p>"I can't believe this," Jack said, "you really do have to stop being so stubborn."</p> <p>"You think so?"</p> <p>"Well at least you have a good shot at looking at her in person, I guess. But the way I've seen her is, she's a beautiful woman. We're pretty good friends."</p> <p>Jack looked at his watch and saw that it was getting late. "If it keeps up like this for too long, I'm going to kill myself."</p> <p>"I'm afraid of that, Jack."</p> <p>"Well, maybe as well we'll be together again, right after you hear that I finally made it back home." Jack looked up and saw that it was almost dawn. He looked at me, a little uncertain, and smiled.</p> <p>"Don't I always make it home before they make their way up to the top?" I joked.</p> <p>They both laughed and then I could see tears start to form in their eyes. Jack smiled at me and walked upstairs to where I was sitting. "You're pretty damn beautiful yourself, young lady."</p> <p>Jack moved close to me and took my hand in his. "And I really appreciate you getting down on your knees before, uhm... this morning."</p> <p>I laughed and said, "Oh Jack, I got a bit excited about that."</p> <p>I saw that he was still holding my hand in his, and had to lean towards him to say, "You know I can't say the same about you."</p> <p>He nodded, "I believe it."</p> <p>Then I saw his cheeks grow red as I watched him. "I know," I told him.</p> <p>Our knees touched, and we smiled. "I don't think we're going to make the whole neighborhood cry," he told me.</p> <p>"I'm not sure I wanna cry." I said, smiling to myself. It had been a long time since I'd gotten into any pretty emotional shit and now I was really enjoying it.</p> <p>"Then I guess it's only fair, you get to see my ass."</p> <p>"You sure you still want to see it?"</p> <p>"Mmm hmm."</p> <p>He grinned, and ran his hand through my hair. The sight of his eyes caressing my skin brought goose bumps to my body.</p> <p>I said, "I'm not exactly sure this is a pleasant experience."</p> <p>"It's a lot better than going home and telling your parents that you and I are now dating."</p> <p>"You were right," I answered. Then, "You know I'm not exactly sure whether I should tell them everything about you and what happened or just keep it from them. Or maybe let them see how I'd feel if they were looking at me like that."</p> <p>He pulled me closer and kissed me. "You're not wrong, young lady. And if you don't tell your parents, I promise I'll make sure it happens before we get back out on the town." Then he let go of me and turned to walk downstairs.</p> <p>"Bye, Jack."</p> <p>"Bye, Jackie."</p> <p>I smiled, then sat up on my desk. If this was going to lead to anything, I was going to enjoy it. I finished pulling up her note and read it.</p> <p>"Jack, thank you again for the great evening you had. We'll see each other again soon and I have to say I'm glad your friend was able to chat you up without getting all nervous about what might be said. Now, let's get back out onto the town and see if we can get this all out of our systems so that we can try again to try again. I know it may be very confusing, but I'm very interested to see what happens with our lives."</p> <p>I smiled at him and leaned over and kissed him. "I don't know if I have to be in the same clothes as him. Now you wait and see if there's anything that we can do to help make our lives easier."</p> <p>Chapter 2.1 Jackie and Jack Get Together</p> <p>Jack and I were both wearing our work attire. It was a black button down, a black, knee length skirt, and a button-down crisp shirt to match. We were both wearing black shoes and my shirt was slit to my belt.</p> <p>I leaned over and kissed Jack. "I can't believe this is really happening and I sure hope it doesn't happen again tonight."</p> <p>Jack smiledâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
