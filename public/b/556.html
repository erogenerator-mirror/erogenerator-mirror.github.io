"I'm glad we decided to stay. I know I was a little nervous that I wasn't going to be able to spend the weekend in the sack with you guys or even try out this new, kinky, sex machine on us. But, I don't think I'm quite ready to even take the chance."</p> <p>I felt him press up against me, and my heart was already beating fast. He smiled and started kissing me passionately. I couldn't get enough, but I couldn't even begin to count the number of times he had kissed me. I pushed him away and looked toward his house. "See where we are?" I asked with a grin, not knowing how I felt about his sexual escapades.</p> <p>"It doesn't matter what we do with you. There will be times you'll have to use your trust to keep this thing going. But, if you're really that close to cumming and you don't give up, we'll stop for both of us to enjoy you."</p> <p>I looked at him skeptically. "How much longer 'bout this thing, you know?"</p> <p>He looked at me and smiled. "I guess you want to know, but that's up to you. You can keep it a secret, but I'm sure you'll cum. I'm sure we'll let each other know."</p> <p>I smiled. "Okay, I guess I have no choice."</p> <p>After putting the toys to work, I pulled the harness off and got into bed. I felt him stir against my side and he began to kiss the side of my neck. His hand started to explore my body, feeling it and stroking my leg. Eventually he moved his hand upward to caress and knead my breasts through my night shirt, sending little jolts of excitement through me. I felt my nipples harden under his fingers and he moved his hand from my breasts to the small of my back, pulling my down toward him. He kept up the kissing, occasionally biting me lightly until I was straying from one lip to the other. I could feel myself getting wet again as he lightly stroked me and I squirmed under him under the blankets.</p> <p>"You're so hot, baby," he growled, "I can't even get my fingers into you." As he did that, he shifted his position so his cock was pressed up against my side, his hand still caressing my breast, but now with his hand pressing against my mound through my jeans. I started to reach out for him, but he shook his head. "Not yet, baby. You're my only other lover right now." This time when I looked back at him, he kissed me deeply. "You're gonna be my only woman this weekend. Not only will we use you, but we will love you."</p> <p>I couldn't speak and I was too busy writhing on the bed to notice his cock was pressing up against my leg. I moaned as our chests were joined together and our bodies pressed together. I could feel the tip of his cock poking up between my inner thigh and I knew that I was in danger of going to heaven. All I could think of was how good it would feel, and how much better it would feel in there.</p> <p>He slipped his hand down to my waist. "Come lie down," he commanded, pulling me to my back and positioning me so that we could just lie there, lips locking as he kissed me and stroked his hands over my body, tracing along my outer arms and down my arms and back up again, this time finding my breasts, his fingernails making trails across my nipples and making them hard in the moonlight, the only light I could get.</p> <p>"Oh God," I managed to say between kisses, "oh, yes, that feels good." His hand started to work down between my legs, and I realized that it must have been something that hadn't happened before, because I felt an urgency coming on as his fingertips brushed over my slick lips, spreading them and teasing the entrance to my vagina. I felt my legs spreading as I opened them willingly to him. I was breathing heavily and whimpering as he started to slip his finger inside me, teasing around my opening and up inside; I started to make little soft sounds with my mouth as he caressed my pussy. "I knew you'd like it," he whispered before kissing me again.</p> <p>I moved my legs to give him better access. The feel of his finger sliding in and out of me made my head swim and my moans of lust fill the air. His hand was moving inside me now, his finger slipping easily up into me, up into my cervixâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
