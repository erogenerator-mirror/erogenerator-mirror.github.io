"M-m-mppphhh, Mmmppphhh, mmmmph!"</p> <p>Her head fell backward and she closed her eyes. Her eyes were watering and her breath was coming in short, ragged gasps. She could feel him slowly rubbing circles around and around her areola. Her hand was still tightly clenched and gripped his cock. It grew harder and harder beneath his hand. Her nipples were sticking out of her shirt, and they felt so sensitive that it felt like skin was tingling everywhere.</p> <p>He slipped a finger into her wet hole, and he moved up in a second. She groaned, and her lips came back down on the base of his skull. He rubbed the tip of his cock around her ass and up the crack of her ass. He was pulling and pushing his hard on into her, and she was loving it. She could feel his cock move inside her and it was so wonderful. Her moans were echoing in the other room, but it was more subdued.</p> <p>He pulled his cock down a little, and then moved it back up, all the way back in. The tip was resting against her cervix, and he moved his hand to slide it down her back, to the waistband of her shorts. He pulled his hand out and slid it over to cup her, and she jumped when his fingers ran over her clit. She moaned, and her hips began dancing on the spot.</p> <p>He leaned down and kissed her, his tongue slipping in and around her mouth. She knew how much she wanted him, and her body craved him more than anything in the world. "Ohh." She cooed when the tip of his tongue flicked her clitoris. They were in this world now, and she began moving her hips even more, urging him on. It felt so good, and she knew she needed it.</p> <p>"Ahh." Her body shuddered into an explosion and she cried out. Her fingers danced over her nipples as her other hand slid into her panties and began to rub her dripping wet pussy. She could no longer hold back, and when she moaned, and held his head between her legs as she reached a second orgasm, she felt the warmth of his tongue deep inside her. He licked and sucked on her, his tongue making circles around her clitoris. She loved his beard, and knew he liked it too. He moved on top of her, and she felt herself spread on the other bed. "Oh God, oh, ah, Ahhhhhh!" She was on the pill, and she didn't object when he slid between her legs at the end of the bed and slid his cock back into her. She was hot as a firecracker and needed to fuck, and he was going to do it. He began to fuck her with long strokes that made her shiver and squeal while his cock moved around inside and across her clit, and she knew he loved it when she made them come. He lifted her hips up again, and then pushed all the way inside her and began to fuck her hard. He wanted to make her cum, and she knew he loved to hear her moan and pant as they fucked.</p> <p>His strokes were strong and purposeless, and his hands cupped her breast and thumbed the nipple. Her hips went into this new dance, and she pushed back to meet each of his thrusts. She knew she shouldn't be doing this, that she should not be having orgasms she did not know how to have, but the feel of him fucking her made her feel so hot, so much better. Then, she felt a warm sensation as he began to stroke inside her more forcefully and her hips bucked. In that moment she knew it was not only him pumping into her, but the other men watching them.</p> <p>He leaned in on her and kissed her deeply, and her hips thrust up involuntarily. She could feel the hardness underneath her, and wished she could tell him in her bones that she loved it. He lifted her off her feet and dropped her back down on the bed again, and began to move his cock in and out again, getting more and more pleasure for her while he fucked her hard. He had slowed as his own orgasm approached, and she began to see the other men watching them, and she knew that someone was watching her and she loved it.</p> <p>She could hold back no more and her body began to shake and shudder as her orgasm neared. "Mhmm. Mhhhmm." She cried out and her head fell forwards as she began to scream into her pillow in triumph.</p> <p>"Mmm, Mmm..." She managed, to not let on how good he felt inside her. She knew he loved her to cum hard and that it meant him wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
