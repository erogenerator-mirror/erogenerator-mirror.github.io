She closed her eyes and continued as though nothing at all had happened, "I'm really getting horny and needed the release right then, it's been a while since I've done anything like that."</p> <p>"Well," I said, "that gives you a few minutes, then all the way back."</p> <p>"Oh, that was nice," she said as she got to her feet again.</p> <p>"Don't mind me, but you know what I like." I stepped aside and Samantha followed me to my bathroom, not looking at me. She sat on the toilet and I leaned forward, taking her face between my hands and kissed her gently but with a hunger that said that I wanted to do things to her that I hadn't done before until now. I slid my lips down her chin, over her neck to her chin again, and down her throat to her chest. The water running into my hands felt soothing and hot and Samantha's nipples were already hard through her bra. It had been quite awhile since we had done anything in the shower and I quickly got my hand back under the water and stroked myself as she gasped into my mouth. A couple inches of the head of my penis was still wet from the shower-water and I pushed it into her. She was already dripping when we'd returned.</p> <p>I let her go and looked at her, not saying a word. "Let's go in," I said and Samantha followed me to the other bathroom.</p> <p>I sat her down on the toilet and sat me in the space between her and the toilet, her legs dangling slightly to the top, her ass cheeks slightly to the right and the bottom to the left. Then she leaned back as far as she could get and wrapped her arms around my neck and rested her chin on my shoulder. I knew what I wanted to do, but my mouth was probably all over a chance of getting that from us. Samantha had her head back and her eyes closed. Her fingers had been tangled in my hair and she moaned several times when I sucked her neck and she shivered from the sensation of my rough lips on her. For a moment, I wasn't sure about letting her have the orgasm, but I thought that it might be fun. As I kissed her throat and earlobe, I told her "Let me do you first." And I knelt on the floor in front of her and watched her face as my mouth moved under that hair. To my shock, there was a lot of wetness on her chest. I licked it up some more, and then pressed my mouth close to her, running my tongue along her breasts as I sucked each nipple. When I was sure that she was as aroused as I was, I slid my fingers around and under her panties, running them along the insides of her legs, which were still slightly open. Her hand shot downward between her legs, between her cheeks, where I found the entrance to her sex. I slid them in and out of her vagina, feeling a little tight and damp from the shower that was still running. As I fingered her, I began to kiss the top of her vagina, which I took as a sign that she was ready. She pushed her bottom into my mouth and I felt her fingers on the outside of my scalp as I sucked on her.</p> <p>Samantha's hand squeezed my ear at something and I stopped my efforts. I put one finger in her and felt its warmth. That was all the signal I was going for. I took my other hand, wet with her juices, and began sliding my fingers in and out of her, pushing them around in a different position than with the shower. I was about three quarters of the way in, and Samantha put her hands by my sides urging me to fuck her. When I felt her pussy spasm around my finger, then her vagina clamp tightly around my fingers, I had it all. My entire body shuddered, my breathing was heavier and I shuddered in a way I had never experienced with a woman before. I kept on slowly stroking her. When she began to thrust herself back into my fingers, I slowed down and kissed my way down her breasts, kissing their underside and circling the areola of one of them, my tongue flicking back and forth on her nipple. She seemed to like it too, and I could tell from her responses that she liked me sucking on her, too. I moved my finger out of her and took her nipple into my mouth again and sucked it.</p> <p>The warm water was having its effects on her, however. "Oh, yes!" she exclaimed, "Oh, that's so fucking good!!"</p> <p>I slid a second finger in her and she was nearly begging me to put them in her now, as if I was already fucking her and wanting to be fucked myself.
