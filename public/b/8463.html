I'm all yours."</p> <p>"Good."</p> <p>Jennifer smiled. "Good?"</p> <p>"Yes good, Jennifer."</p> <p>At that moment, the phone rang.</p> <p>"It's me, I'm at the mall," said Jennifer with a laugh and the line went dead.</p> <p>"Oh well that was unexpected I'll be right there."</p> <p>"That was me doing you a favour." And Jennifer gave Katie some privacy and a quick kiss goodbye.</p> <p>"I can't believe you would do this for me," Katie said.</p> <p>"I was glad and it's really for me."</p> <p>"Really?" Katie asked.</p> <p>"Yeah really, Katie. You do know I was thinking about you all afternoon."</p> <p>"Oh I know," Katie said. "I thought about you all the afternoon. It's about time. I'm gonna miss you so much that I'll do anything."</p> <p>"Anytime Katie. Anytime." She was looking at her hands over her face.</p> <p>After a few more minutes, Katie decided to go and see if she could find anyone for some lunch. She grabbed her keys and made her way over to the diner, a little more than two miles from where she had spent the whole afternoon. She knew that as soon as she got there, someone would come for her. She wasn't about to wait and tell Mike or Jennifer, that would be bad. She decided to find some decent guy that really needed to eat, and to say goodbye to Katie as well.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>A minute or so later and Jennifer was sitting next to her with her eyes closed, Katie was leaning over her and smiling.</p> <p>"Hi Katie," said Jennifer softly.</p> <p>"Hey," said Katie softly.</p> <p>"I can still feel your heart beating underneath of me. It's like it was there forever. It's been missing something in here."</p> <p>Jennifer smiled. "I remember. I got lost last night and went to check-up on you."</p> <p>"That is good information. I'm glad."</p> <p>"You are, too. That, and just being here is a good way to make me feel. There may even be some good vibes that I can give you."</p> <p>"It would have been fun just to go through it with you," said Jennifer.</p> <p>"Well maybe you could give me pointers," said Jennifer, as she lifted Katie's shirt to show off her abs. "I am sure that you have seen some girls naked here, not all that many."</p> <p>Katie grinned. "I think that I do in fact have a few."</p> <p>"That is good to hear. You do?"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah. I have to make one up," said Katie.</p> <p>"Good. Now come on, I'm not done here. I'm hungry."</p> <p>Katie giggled and walked over to her purse for her keys. She gave her left arm a slight rub with her right and gave her left one a little rub with her right. Jennifer leaned in and kissed her with a soft kiss and pulled Katie's face to hers before whispering. "Come on and have your lunch."</p> <p>"I can't. I need my lunch," exclaimed Katie. "And if there's any other food out there we may be eating it before I eat it."</p> <p>"Don't worry. I've got everything we'll need."</p> <p>Katie couldn't believe that Jennifer was even considering this.</p> <p>"And I need some lunch," laughed Katie. "So you want yours too?"</p> <p>"Sure. I'm starving after my shower."</p> <p>"Can I get you something before you go?" asked Jennifer.</p> <p>"Sure," said Katie.</p> <p>Jen smiled and extended her hand before lifting Katie's hand and pressing it against her breast. She put a little kiss to her palm before kissing her hand all over again, making Katie's heartbeat race at her touch.</p> <p>"God how I want to taste that," said Katie to Jennifer.</p> <p>"Can't wait," said Jennifer. "Can I have my lunch?"</p> <p>"Sure. Here you go," said Katie as Jennifer disappeared down the diner's menu.</p> <p>"I guess we can be neighbors then," said Jennifer as Katie put her hand under her top.</p> <p>"I think it would be pretty good out here," said Katie as she kissed Jennifer's fingers.</p> <p>They had almost finished their lunch at the diner when Jennifer brought over a note: 'I'm going to go change into something sexy. Just don't put this over your head. Your clothes are beautifulâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
