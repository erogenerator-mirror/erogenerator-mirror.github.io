"We'll get through this and we'll make every mistake ever made. Besides, you just might like your own reward." She licked her finger and then slid two fingers into my still wet pussy. "Mmmm, your lips, your tongue. I'm so glad you like it this much." She licked her lips, savouring the taste of a pussy in her mouth. "I'm glad we met. And you're going to look so good. I can't wait to suck your cock." She licked her lips again and then slid her fingers from my pussy back into mine. I was surprised at the wetness of my pussy, and the pleasure of the two fingers inside me.</p> <p>I had a dream about me and this guy, and when I came in the office. Now, here I was again, having an orgasm, while she was doing her best to make up for all the cum.</p> <p>The phone rang for just a moment - it was the receptionist saying she would be happy to come up to my desk. I answered it with a sigh of relief as I remembered that we didn't actually talk about the job. There was something else though, and with my legs still a little shaky, I managed to get the phone off the hook.</p> <p>"Oh god, oh god, don't do this to me - not again! I can't even look at this on the phone. Don't even do it again!" My mind had been running round my mind again and once she had dropped her hand from mine and slid my fingers from my pussy, it was like all the fun had come to an end. She wasn't doing anything to me now, and I had no idea if I wanted that all to myself.</p> <p>I heard her voice on the phone and then she had said what she'd been thinking - that it had been just a game, to make sure I didn't go back on my part of the bargain and that I would leave my office. I had to try to get through that. I didn't answer her.</p> <p>Well, that was it. The phone had been right where it started, I wasn't going to even look at it and it wasn't going to get my lips on it. It was just a one-way deal. She was a good actress and I was a bit embarrassed having gone through all this with no one to go round. I didn't want to hurt her feelings about this and I didn't want to scare her. Maybe it would be alright if I didn't show up at the office today? Maybe it would be alright with her if I went back to my normal life once she got to my place. She was just about to leave me alone, and I would have to come home after all.</p> <p>But then she had stopped talking and she had slipped away. I could have just told her that I didn't want a job anymore and left, but I didn't - I needed to be alone for a while, to keep an eye on things. I didn't think we would ever have to talk about what had happened. I had nothing to worry about.</p> <p>I went home and got a shower and headed straight for the kitchen where I began making a meal. I could hardly concentrate on what was cooking and I knew something would soon be put to the test. If our marriage turned out to be a nightmare, or if things got too bad for either of us, I would be sure of it. It just couldn't continue. There had to be some way to sort this out. It had to be me who got to give her my punishment and the way she would get to kiss me with that lipstick, the way her eyes would sparkle when she looked at me while I was dressed. I thought I might even try to play it off a little but that was all I could think about. She had done that and I wouldn't lose me, but I felt I would probably do that to keep us together as long as I could but I couldn't do that to her right now.</p> <p>There was a knock on the house. I put a face and went to look through the kitchen door. There was no movement on the other side of the door and suddenly I felt a tremendous weight on the front of my shoulders and my whole body jerked, pushing me down on the floor face first. "Oh fuck!" I thought as the heavy weight slowly came down on me. "Oh my God! I haven't heard a thing and I'm naked! And what the fuck happened to my clothes?" I got up to my feet and put all my knuckled up clothes back on. I needed to make sure they looked as if they were properly dressed.</p> <p>"I'm so sorry," I said. "I'll phone you the whole time and make sure everything is okay." I was naked and I felt a bit vulnerable in my armsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
