I didn't mean for anyone to be sitting there in the rain. It's not like I cared for someone and he was just standing there. For one of the first time in many weeks, I got a real sense of what he would be like once he got back. It was like I remembered the night I lost my virginity back in high school, I didn't even know it. But, it seemed like a dream at one point I didn't feel guilty. And not just to be alone; I was really worried about what was going to happen with him.</p> <p>It was like the sun had finally hit me. But, I didn't go with him. I grabbed an umbrella and headed to the front, as I walked into the house I could see that there were people outside on the front porch waving in the breeze.</p> <p>I walked up until I was right near the house, just off the path that went about half a mile before I saw the car pull up. I stepped back to make sure, as my eyes scanned around, I saw that whoever was there was completely naked.</p> <p>"Oh my god!" I said with amazement. "Where is he?"</p> <p>"He's in there," a young young man said next to me. "How did you get out of here?"</p> <p>As he turned around, I looked in his direction and there was still so many people out there. The young guy looked at me and smiled. I smiled back. God what was wrong with me? I thought of calling an ambulance, but knew that couldn't be. I felt really uncomfortable. And I knew my own fear.</p> <p>"I'm still not sure, but maybe I can show you back why we're on the road," he smiled back at me.</p> <p>"Okay, sure," I said as we turned around. I walked back to the car, my head was still on my shoulder, trying to make it sit still as I walked back out back to the house. "I'll be back if you want to call out some food," I offered, as I walked past him.</p> <p>I saw him walk back down the path and head out toward the street. His legs were long and strong as they crossed over the road and I thought how strong he was. He waved to me as his hands went up out of the ground, then he looked back as I approached.</p> <p>"You're still here, I can come back to you when we're done," he said, extending his hand as if he was going to shake mine. We shook hands and waved, then he turned, walked quickly toward the house. I started walking up the path and said, "I'm sorry for making such a big deal about the rain you're going to have to pay for."</p> <p>"So am I," he said back to me with a nod of his head. I smiled and looked at him. I realized he wasn't just attractive, he was sexy as hell. I was sure that was the only reason he said what he was thinking and looking, but I also saw that the fear I had been giving myself when I was with him was nothing compared to the look and confidence in his eyes.</p> <p>The walk to the house led me up to the second floor, at the bottom of the stairs, there was a big wooden kitchen with a kitchen area just for the purpose of a home gym and exercise room. I knocked on the door of the exercise area next to the exercise area.</p> <p>When the door was open I was taken aback by the sight of the man outside waiting inside and standing at the door looking at me with concern on his face. When he saw my expression he turned around and gave a little shrug of his shoulders.</p> <p>"Oh, hi, I came to see if you were staying. It's raining hard down on you."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I said looking back, I wasn't sure why he did that, not just for my sake but, maybe for the fact I was scared about the rain hitting my feet.</p> <p>"No problem," he said with a grin on his face. "Please wait a few minutes, you can get me something to drink."</p> <p>I took a few minutes to walk back to my room and put my clothes on. One of the bags was still there on my bed, also in its dark room. I knocked loudly on the door, hoping there was a light switch.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I couldn't let anything happen to you." He said, then he turned and headed back towards the bedroom.</p> <p>"What is going on?" I asked getting back on my feet. I was shaking from nerves after seeing him on his knees with a large bagâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
