Why on earth would I go to that church and listen to some woman on her knees begging for forgiveness."</p> <p>Heather put a hand up to my shoulder and looked at him sternly, "You should not have gone and sat in the bathtub, because you would have caused me pain. I forgive you, but I would not have been able to help you if you had asked."</p> <p>Heather stepped away from me, taking my arm and walked me to the bedroom. I was shocked to find that she had not left the room since she had come. There was soft music on the stereo and an old-timey tune, "My Lady," by The Eagles, played on the stereo. She led me to the bed and sat me down. She went on in as she began to caress my chest and play with my nipples.</p> <p>"Do you see what you have done?" she asked. "I would like you to spend the week with me here. I really enjoyed being with you... and I wanted you to have a wonderful time at dinner tonight. I saw that Tom and Mary are still here."</p> <p>"Oh, I think you have already made up your mind," I replied. "I wish we were married, with an open marriage, but as your Lord, I want you to have a special place in my heart and in my body. I do not know what to expect in my marriage, but I think it has already been decided... If I may say so, it was with you..." I started to say more, and I stopped myself. My mouth was dry and dryer was running. I hoped she would give me all that I asked for in return for my kindness, and would at least want to know what it was all about. She must have found something that was not so important to me at the moment, because she smiled that smile and said, "Yes, my friend, there's plenty of time for that. Come to me... take my hand, please." The look on her face was that of happiness. She helped me stand up and I could feel her smile on my face as she helped me out of the bed and into the bathroom. I took off my robe and stepped into the shower. Heather was waiting for me. I turned the water on and began washing her hair. When I had finished with her hair, she turned and I began to wash her lovely body.</p> <p>As she had told me, as a child I had never washed Heather's body, preferring to wash hers. She had always preferred to let me do her, and when I had asked her about it, she had said that she preferred to be cleansed. Even when I had spent the rest of my life washing and bathing her, she wasn't afraid to ask me to do her body. She wanted to be cleansed, and she would take any of it as long as I would have it all. I washed and washed until I felt like the one that she had never let me wash, and so I continued. Every surface of her body seemed to have a life of its own. Her breasts seemed to swell and her nipples seemed to be hard and long and she seemed to enjoy sucking them. Her bush was trimmed but she had never trimmed it, and the hair just hid the little nub that I was already hard for, waiting for me to give it a good washing. As I washed her body, Heather was gently rubbing her pubic hair, which was now as soft and wavy as the hair on her head. Her fingers and her fingers were so gentle and gentle that when she stroked my cock and I got closer to coming, she stopped me and asked me to turn back, which I did.</p> <p>We remained like that for a long time until I asked her to turn around and bend over, which she did as I was washing her lovely buttocks. I soaped the globes to her thighs and began to wash them with my soapy hands, slowly massaging the water-drenched hair, and then the round globes surrounding her puckered anus. When I finished with the last of her ass, I reached for the shampoo and began to stroke and caress her lovely soft hair, and Heather let the shampoo fall to the floor. I soaped her feet, then her calves. She leaned her upper body back onto the wall and I reached around and began to stroke her breasts as I was washing. This brought forth a smile on her lips and she reached down and began to run her fingers through my hair just like she had done to me. We washed each other, and I soaped her long hair, which she had put in a towel, at the top of my bath. It was a lovely feeling and I soaped her soft hair, letting her hair flow over my fingers andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
