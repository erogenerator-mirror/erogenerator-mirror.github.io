You got to know him and you became friends. You had so many of those... you are like mother to me. You just never thought that you could get a better job, that you had a great life. You felt like just the girl you always pictured you would be, and it was like you were never going to give it up."</p> <p>I could feel my pussy gushing and I knew that I couldn't resist any longer. I slipped off my skirt, knelt down, and then dove between his legs. I knew that in a minute I would have him again, but this time it'd be to the extent that I could take it all.</p> <p>His cock was hard as stone and it's shape was the perfect length. It pulsed, quivered, and throbbed even harder as I kissed, licked, and nibbled it, first his ball sack, then the shaft and the head as I felt it grow and respond to me.</p> <p>Then I slid him out into the warm mouth that was going to take more cock. That was it. I wanted to do all of that! I had to make him happy, and then I would reward him in a way he wouldn't expect.</p> <p>I wrapped my lips around him and slid him home. As I sucked him hard and deep, I could taste his cum on my tongue. A drop of it escaped my lips and dripped off his shaft. I felt him arch and my lips tightened around him. Then he was in a state of intense desire and began thrusting into my mouth. My mouth was sore from his intrusion and I needed to use all my strength to keep him from hitting my gag reflex.</p> <p>I wanted him to cum in my mouth. I wanted you to see me pleasure you and I was going to give you every last bit of pleasure it could.</p> <p>As he began to speed up and then, as he began to grow and his body shuddered uncontrollably, I couldn't help but be afraid. I knew that I couldn't take him off, but I hoped I wouldn't get to much of it. Then as suddenly he pulled me up to a standing position.</p> <p>He kissed me deeply and deeply and as we did he reached down and began to stroke his cock back and forth, all the while I was still sucking him. He got very stiff and started to jerk with a loud grunt.</p> <p>I looked up to see a glistening drop formed on the corner of my mouth. I opened wide and began to massage him with my tongue. I ran my long tongue down his shaft, down and up and back up as he began to move back toward me.</p> <p>I looked up at him and he was staring down at me. His smile was that devilish smirk that I so loved! I knew that when finally he pulled me up, that it would be that little bit of heaven, that special moment of my life.</p> <p>Then he pushed me back on the couch and climbed off of me so that I was positioned over the end, and then again he began to rub his thick cock up and down against me. With his hands he held my hips and began to enter me from behind.</p> <p>I felt like I had never felt this before. I'm sure that all of the pleasure I'd experienced last night was simply from what we were doing. I was a virgin all over again, all I really knew was that I wanted to be happy.</p> <p>As he was pushing in, I felt his hips move, but not very carefully. He wasn't a patient man and it seemed like he was trying to do it slowly. As his dick slid in and out of me, I was glad because that sensation was just the opposite. As he filled me more and more of his shaft was going into me, I began to feel the tingle of the beginnings of my first full-blown orgasm. I wanted the feelings of it all again, and I wanted to make you. To make my man and to make me happy.</p> <p>I reached down and began to caress his balls. As he continued to thrust hard and fast into me, I began to cum.</p> <p>I thought it was just about ready to explode. Then as his dick began to speed up, he began to feel me cum again. That feeling was something I could not get over. It was that feeling that made me orgasm and I felt that intense warmth shoot through me. It was like something inside of me had just snapped and I was there. It was the warm, sweet, salty taste I was beginning to crave again, and at the same time it was the intense feeling of his dick moving in and out of my pussy. It had the same effect as when I was riding him.</p> <p>My thighs were wet with his pre-cum and they were getting sore from being so hard for so long. It felt so good that it made me arch my back and grind againstâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
