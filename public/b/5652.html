I felt like I was going on a magical high as the first of the week rolled around. My pussy was still wet and tingly, I got so fucking excited to cum. My nipples responded to the cool air and were so hard they almost hurt, but they also seemed to stand proud. The whole weekend was going to me. I didn't even realize I didn't have any clothes on. I don't think I was wearing anything except a pair of tiny, sheer panties that fit perfectly. What a sight!</p> <p>I found my bra in the closet and put on a small white t-shirt that could easily fit over a bikini style tank. I took the rest of my things off and went back to the dorm room. I checked my wardrobe and made sure I had everything I needed in my top drawer. There was only one more room to go in and I needed a change of clothes. This was it. I changed into my tiny swimsuit. It was so short that if I bent over slightly the bottoms of my ass peeked out. It would only seem to show a small bit of my upper thighs but would leave plenty of leg showing. After my swim I put on sandals and slipped into my panties. The fabric was thin enough that the sides of my lips seemed to show through in the way I wanted. I noticed I hadn't really worn any underwear since a few months prior.</p> <p>As I went in the door I could have sworn I heard voices in the restroom. It sounded to me like they were talking, but there were no doors. I decided to just keep it to myself and get right into my new room.</p> <p>I walked into the room to find that the bathroom was empty. I didn't bother locking the door though as I had expected it would be empty. I changed and slipped my panties on. It felt good on my bare skin and the taut material felt incredible as it ran over my naked skin. I slipped on my sandals and headed to the bathroom. I felt like a little slut, but it felt good at the same time. I looked in the mirror. My taut body looked fantastic and it gave me something to do when I was at home. I could have easily stood here and let some guy fuck me. I looked to see if anybody had noticed. I thought for sure somebody would if I bent over like this. I could feel the material against my tits. I felt incredibly sexy. As I walked I could feel how wet my panties were. My nipples were hard and stood out with the soft material. I could feel my pussy tingling and knew it wouldn't be long before I was coming. My body felt like it was on fire with desire. This would work the night out.</p> <p>As I entered the bathroom the door to my room opened.</p> <p>"Come on in," my dorm roommate said. She stepped in and closed the door behind her. She was naked except for a pair of white panties. I was stunned. I didn't know if I could handle her but she had told me to. I just smiled. She pulled the door closed behind her and walked over to me. She pulled me into a long kiss that left me breathless. I had to kiss her back. She tasted so good and I knew I wanted her. It was a strange feeling to have you pressed up against someone as you wanted to kiss them, kiss them and touch them.</p> <p>She kissed me all the way from my lips to my shoulder and back to my neck. I never realized how much of them turned me on. Each one was different, from the same spot to the same place on my body. She made me feel sexy like this. She knew what would turn me on, so she teased me and made me feel so good. I could sense the effect she had on me and it made me feel things I had never felt before.</p> <p>She took my hand and led me to the bathroom. When we got in the bathroom she started rubbing her body against mine. This made my nipples seem to get harder as they rubbed against her body.</p> <p>"Lie down on the bathroom vanity," she said as she turned to the sink. "I'm going to make you feel so good." She reached down between her legs and started rubbing my tits, rubbing the nipples with her fingers.</p> <p>I felt so sexy. She was still wearing those little panties, but they had no back. The silky cloth was cool on my skin as I started feeling the skin of her tight panties. They were so sheer that I could feel the outline of her pubic hair as they brushed against me.</p> <p>"You have a pretty ass, don't you," she said as she pulled the strings on the back of her panties. "My pussy and ass are so tight..."</p> <p>"What?"
