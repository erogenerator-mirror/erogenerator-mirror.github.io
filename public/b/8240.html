I felt it for a full minute as she moved in small waves. I did not want her to move for a long time. I wanted her to last long and give herself to me to savor. And I had wanted to feel myself on top of her body.</p> <p>My hands went to her ass and I felt the cheeks of her ass. She lifted her head from my chest as her eyes flew open wide as if she could see the stars. I smiled as I felt her climax. Her back still arched and her legs wrapped my body. Her hips started to move slowly again until her whole body was a mass of quivering muscles. I kissed her hair to watch the expressions on her face. Her eyes were half closed and a smile played around her lips.</p> <p>"You're beautiful," I whispered to her. "I'm the luckiest man on earth."</p> <p>She kissed me deeply and said, "Are you?"</p> <p>I just looked down at her until she turned to kiss me. I kissed her again and she looked surprised to see me looking into her eyes. I smiled at her and moved my hands up to caress her face and head. I ran my hands down over her shoulder and arm and then back up the length of her neck and on to her breast. I moved them around for a while but she didn't like my going over her in this manner. As much as I loved the touch of her skin on my hands and then her body in my hands, I wasn't going to rush it. I wanted to savor this. When I moved my hands back to the front of her body and began to caress her again, I looked into her eyes again as my thumbs moved over her erect nipples.</p> <p>My hands moved over her body again but this time she didn't move. Her eyes were closed and I saw that they were full of love, but fear as well, for that was her only emotion. I didn't let her come down from her orgasm yet and continued kissing her. This time, when I rolled her over and got her on her back, I lay between her open legs. Her eyes looked up at me as they opened at my kiss. She smiled as she saw me kiss her and then saw my hand moving down to her pussy.</p> <p>I began to play with her opening and her thighs went wide. I slid my finger into her hole and found my way to her clitoris. I started to play with it while I slipped my finger out of her and then back to her clit with the same motion. I wanted her to know that she was in control.</p> <p>"Please...," she started.</p> <p>I moved my finger out and looked at her.</p> <p>"Please?" I whispered to her and kissed her ear.</p> <p>"Yes, please."</p> <p>Her eyes closed and she said, "I'll do anything."</p> <p>"Anything?" I asked and smiled at her as I slowly pulled back.</p> <p>She looked up at me as if she did not want to say anything but then said, "You can do anything you want to me."</p> <p>I smiled to myself and moved down to her. I kissed her as I held myself over her, not touching her. Her breasts were firm and her nipples stood up at attention. I kissed them again and then started to lick and suck them. I rolled each nipple with my tongue.</p> <p>Cheryl was breathing heavily while I worked over her body. Her nipples were standing hard and she was moaning to my touch. I moved down my body stopping to lick her thighs and belly button on which her legs were spread and she was rubbing her thighs against my face.</p> <p>I stood and leaned forward placing my hands flat on the bed. I rubbed my penis as I looked at her. I wanted to take her right then and there. I wanted to make this lovemaking last as long as possible. I wanted to make a beautiful and long lasting relationship. I wanted to see it all. I wanted to be with her the moment one day when I let myself in and could give up what we had fought for. I wanted to love her with everything I had and wanted to be hers in every way I could.</p> <p>My penis was rigid and I was looking at her sex with anticipation. I moved my knees apart and she looked at me. I could see the desire in her eyes and her breathing was getting faster. I moved my face up to kiss her and she smiled as our lips met and then moved her mouth to mine. We kissed as our bodies moved into each other. Then her legs moved around my hips and she opened for me to enter. They wrapped me with an endless tightness as I entered her.</p> <p>"Ohhhhh...!" she moaned.</p> <p>I knew she hadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
