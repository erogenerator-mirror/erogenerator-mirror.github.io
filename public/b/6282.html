As soon as she was out of sight, I quickly started sucking on that little patch of skin and she was squealing in joy. She came at least twice before I had a third strong orgasm, and she squirted just as heavily as I had.</p> <p>I had my hand back on her pussy, stroking her labia, and the last of this glorious sexual feeling was going to push us both over. She started pushing herself into me, and started breathing hard. I don't think she could even speak. We stayed in each others arms as we both came down.</p> <p>It felt like we'd drifted off into a happy and contented state; I didn't care what it was. She looked at me, and I just nodded. Her fingers were gently massaging my face and forehead, and her eyes were filled with contentment. After a few moments, she kissed me, and then pushed herself off my body. As she moved back towards the bed, our legs fell, and as they did, she brought her thigh up and sat on my face. She looked amazing, which gave me a full blown hard on. When she leaned back, she was looking down at me smiling. She reached back and, grabbing my dick, pushed it back into my pants. The look on her face at that moment was the most erotic thing I could ever imagine.</p> <p>With her legs out of the way of my head, I could actually see her pussy and my cock, which was still in the same place I'd been just moments before. She smiled, and kissed me again, before sitting back on top of me. She reached a hand down, and started pumping it gently. Her other hand went down toward her pussy, and started rubbing her clit very softly again. She looked me in the eye, smiled, and winked at me. Her breathing picked up and her face began to turn a darker shade of red. Her moaning slowed a bit, and she started biting her lip. I looked around the room, before feeling the bed move as she sat more upright, and her ass was sticking up in the air.</p> <p>It only took a few seconds to realize she was masturbating me again while leaning back on my body. She didn't seem to notice that we had moved off the bed entirely by now and had her face directly in front of my cock now. She started sucking on it without any further thought. It was already fully erect, and she was able to get it fully into her mouth with no problem. She kept sucking, and she was stroking my cock, and making me almost forget I was actually standing in the middle of the big bed. Her free hand had returned to rubbing her clit, and her eyes were closed and head tilted back. She was biting her lip again, but her head shook back and forth just enough to let her know that we were both going to cum at any moment.</p> <p>Just the idea that I was going to watch her orgasm was enough to send me over the edge. I started spurting my load into her mouth, and she just kept pushing her fingers into her pussy, and I was shooting streams of hot sticky cum into her waiting mouth. She kept pumping me until every drop was gone, before pulling her lips away from my cock. She was smiling, and she was still rubbing her pussy again. I started thinking to myself that it really did take a lot of effort for this beautiful looking woman to actually cum. For a good half an hour, my thoughts wandered as I watched her take half a big glob of sperm in her mouth, and swallow, as well as the rest of it. Finally, I was completely spent from my exertions, and when I looked down she noticed that I was done. My semi-hard cock was now lying in a heap in front of me, with a drop of glistening sperm at the tip.</p> <p>"My turn," I said, as we both got up. I laid on my back, and she sat next to me. I reached down, and started rubbing her crotch. She pulled me down so that I was on top of her. I wanted to kiss her so bad, but when we stopped, and started kissing again, I thought it was time to turn it down.</p> <p>"I have to tell you that you did have the kinkiest thing. It just gets me so hot. And you did it with great skill. I love it. And we should do it a lot more...," she said with a sly smile. Her eyes opened, and her smile was just a little bit smug.</p> <p>"Mmmhmm," was all that was going through my mind as I pulled away. I could see in her eyes that she was still lying there, and that she was thinking that I could do it even better. I thought she was kidding.</p> <p>"Let's goâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
