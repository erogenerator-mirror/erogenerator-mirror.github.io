The look on her face was priceless. He smiled up as she slid onto his lap in his lap. "Are you enjoying the rest of your stay?"</p> <p>"Are you kidding? I'll be so grateful when you're able to fuck me again."</p> <p>"Good. I'm looking forward to it."</p> <p>"That's nice, babe. I'll make sure you feel all the way to the top."</p> <p>She pushed her ass away but he kept his cock buried in her and asked what he could do to help her. "I thought I'd bring my toys," she said.</p> <p>"Okay babe, let's get that done, then I'll let you sleep and rest. Come to bed after you go to sleep."</p> <p>"Good night babe!" He kissed her cheek and told her he loved her and hoped they were seeing each other soon. She hugged him and rolled off the couch and turned out the lights. She felt so much better when she slept. He'd made love to her and felt so powerful. It was like there was no other woman for her.</p> <p>She was so grateful that he had decided to let her sleep and was going to bed after they finished playing with her body. She didn't feel self conscious; she was happy to be there with him. His touch and his eyes and his touch... she loved it. She didn't even remember why she agreed to go to bed at first. She didn't mind lying there naked in bed naked, and she didn't have to hide herself a bit either. It was so new to her and made her feel safe.</p> <p>*</p> <p>"Crap! Damn it! Let's watch a movie!"</p> <p>He had the remote to his TV off by now and he put the book into the bottom drawer of his night stand. He closed the cabinet to the side of the bed so there was only the two of them. He took the remote and put them back in the drawer. "Do you need a drink to get it down?"</p> <p>"Yeah, water please." She got up a little but he was still getting ready. They were both getting tired of drinking water. They had only been in bed for a few hours, but tonight they both were starving for food. His phone rang and he answered it.</p> <p>"Hello?"</p> <p>"Hey! Do you have your toy for the night? It's in the middle of my room..."</p> <p>"Yeah. How much do you want?"</p> <p>"It's not too much, really. What about you?"</p> <p>"I'll give you fifteen minutes but I'll take fifteen minutes to get my vibrator."</p> <p>"Okay. Thanks. Bye" He hung up his phone and turned around. He was getting the first two fingers into her pussy now. He could hardly hear her breathing on the other end of the phone. "What the hell is wrong with you?"</p> <p>"I'm not you, and you know damn well what I want. That's my vibrator you're holding, so I want to hold it while I jerk myself off." He started massaging her clit with his thumb. "God dammit! No way!" She wasn't sure if she was screaming or sobbing, but she wasn't going to call security to tell them she was in the middle of her own orgasm.</p> <p>"Please don't do that, or I'll stop. I don't want to hurt you." But she did need his cock inside her.</p> <p>"Please don't touch me!"</p> <p>"That's not it at all. Just hold my cock with your hand for a minute." He put one of her nipples into his mouth and sucked on it, then moved his hand up to her pussy and inserted a finger. He slowly moved it between her lips and into her pussy, then pushed it up against her cervix.</p> <p>"Stop! Please stop!"</p> <p>"Sorry babe! I'm sorry!" and he moved his finger around in her hole and down to her clitoris.</p> <p>"Please, don't do that! I'm not ready to take anymore!"</p> <p>"Hold it!"</p> <p>"What's wrong?"</p> <p>"I'm sorry for not playing fair." She let him go and he put his finger to his lips and kissed them. "I'm horny!" He moved his finger and put it back on her clit. "I'm sorry!"</p> <p>"Sorry doesn't cut it, hon. I'm sorry."</p> <p>"Fuck off," she laughed. She was exhausted and couldn't move. She had nothing left to give. He pulled his finger out completely.</p> <p>"What's wrong?"</p> <p>"I'm okayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
