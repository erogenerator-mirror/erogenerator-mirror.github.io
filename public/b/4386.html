"It means I have a responsibility to get rid of her. That's why I do what I can."</p> <p>"Okay," her voice grew shaky. It had been a while. I wasn't sure I'd managed to get her to give me up before that.</p> <p>"We've been together for years now. Sometimes we share our bed," I smiled.</p> <p>"Do you really say that you would agree with that?" she asked, eyebrows raised.</p> <p>"No, I didn't agree. You know. You're a girl with a strong libido. She's very sexy. Her body is a bit larger than yours, so we have sex more often. It wouldn't stop me from fantasizing though. I don't want to leave her."</p> <p>The way I said it sounded so corny to say, but I was sure it was true. I was sure that if I wasn't so uptight about it I wouldn't believe. I felt a bit of pride that I could have her answer from the same. I mean, she could always say that she felt it was something for both of us, but we couldn't always argue over who could say it.</p> <p>"Well, I am certainly a girl that appreciates a good orgasm."</p> <p>"I think you're quite a woman." she said, smiling.</p> <p>"Well, I'm glad you like my body. I've always wanted to see a boy naked. Have a little fun." she grinned. I don't know why, but I felt that I had. That was true with Rachel, too. But I also had a certain urge to go down on Tina. The thought of what I was about to do to her just wasn't something I was comfortable with to do. But Tina didn't like it. But she seemed okay with it.</p> <p>She reached out and ran her finger back through her wet hair. "But I can give you a little more. If I really do it just for you." I reached behind me, and ran my hand through my hair. I guess it made sense to me. Tina was not as experienced as I was.</p> <p>"All this talk about not letting a boy touch me makes me pretty horny. Are you sure you're okay with all this?" my voice was quiet so she could hear me.</p> <p>She nodded, and took her finger to her lips. "Yes, I do believe that if it's all right with you."</p> <p>"I won't make any promises," I whispered.</p> <p>"Promise?" she responded.</p> <p>"I promise. I just want to be inside of you," I whispered back. Tina's eyes widened for a split second before she smiled and lowered her eyes as if I'd said something wrong.</p> <p>"I didn't mean the word 'I'." she said softly. I nodded and reached over to her and pulled her closer. We held together as one body for a few seconds before our lips met and our kiss was welcomed with a soft mew from Tina. I ran my fingers through her hair, feeling it flow over me even as she snaked her arm around my lower back. Tina didn't kiss me long, and just held me as I rested my head on her shoulder.</p> <p>"I've had this for a long time," she said. "When I saw you walking the street after you drove over here yesterday, I kept hoping to see you again, but I never had the nerve."</p> <p>"Me either," I whispered softly in the dark, but it felt so good.</p> <p>"When I see you coming down the street again this morning, I just want to go out there in the morning. I've only been going out with my husband all week. It's been such a long time since I've been alone with another woman, and I don't want to be alone with anyone else." Tina looked across the parking lot at the empty storefront where her car was parked. "I wish I could see you again."</p> <p>"Do you think so," I said softly.</p> <p>"I'm sure I have," she said, pulling me in for another kiss.</p> <p>"Do you want to do it again like last time?" I asked, not sure how we'd answer that.</p> <p>"Definitely," she replied, and it was as if the words had escaped her.</p> <p>I lifted her in my arms and carried her to her car, feeling the weight of her in my arms as I settled her. I kissed her and felt her legs part for me. "You're so beautiful," I said after a moment of hesitation. She was right. I'd never felt that I could see myself so completelyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
