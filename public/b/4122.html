"A little over eight months and I still haven't had another man. I still want you though."</p> <p>"That's fine," I replied, "I have never had a girl since I lost my virginity."</p> <p>"Really?" she asked looking at me with excitement in her eyes. "Well, there's no other girls around you know, so I could have you."</p> <p>I laughed as she said the last, "I'm game."</p> <p>"I'm the most important person in my life to you?" she asked as she took my hand to her mouth and kissed it.</p> <p>"I might start dating for you before this week is over."</p> <p>"No, it's only been eight months and that is already the longest I've ever been with another man."</p> <p>"Maybe I should take care of you myself."</p> <p>"I can't imagine," I said looking at my watch and "Let's get out of the hot tub." I helped her down and stood between her legs as my hard cock slid across her naked pussy mound. "God, you're wet!" I said looking up at her. She put her heels on the hot bar and spread her legs wide apart. Reaching between her legs I spread her swollen lips and ran my fingers over her clit.</p> <p>"It's too late now," she sighed as I gently touched her lips. I looked at the wet pink interior of her pussy and she gasped at my touch. "My body's ready. Go ahead, baby, make love to me." Her words were so sexy when she spoke them to me and her face showed as if her eyes were about to pop from her head right out of her head.</p> <p>I dipped my head between her legs and tasted the wetness from her pussy as she opened for me. I looked over her beautiful belly as I reached my tongue up to her clitoris. I could feel her shudder as we made contact. My tongue and lips began to work over her clitoris as my fingers plunged in and out of her hot, wet hole.</p> <p>"God, this feels so good."</p> <p>I stopped long enough to flip over onto my back in the warm water and she straddled me. Holding my cock she lowered herself onto me. Her hot pussy felt so good sliding down on my hard cock as our bodies moved back and forth in it.</p> <p>"I want this to last," she said as I could feel her breasts against my chest. My hands were on her firm ass as she lifted myself up so that I would enter her again.</p> <p>"Oh yes!" she cried as I felt her warmth around my cock. I could feel her walls clench around me like a vise as I slowly pushed into her and then felt her bottom as I withdrew.</p> <p>"Harder," she cried out as she started to lift herself up again. "You feel so good," she cried as she pushed herself down on me.</p> <p>I leaned forward and began to lick and suck on her stiffened nipple and her hand began to pinch and twist it. This set her off and she buried her face deeper in my neck as she came.</p> <p>"Yes! Yes!" she cried. Her body shook with her orgasm as I continued to thrust up into her pussy.</p> <p>"Baby," I whispered. "Your pussy was so hot, so wet and so tight. Your pussy felt like a hot hand as it gripped my cock."</p> <p>"God, yes!" she cried as my words and actions sent her over the edge again. With one last thrust I slipped out of her and she collapsed on the hot, wet floor of the hot tub, gasping for breath.</p> <p>"God, that was incredible," she said when she caught her breath and looked up at me. We held each other and kissed for a while. "Is this going to happen again? If not, at least for a few weeks."</p> <p>I leaned forward and held her and we kissed for some minutes. Then I sat up and began to stroke her breasts. "Will you marry me?" I whispered.</p> <p>"I've dreamed about it, and I wanted to wait until I was twenty to make the proposal."</p> <p>"What if I was twenty-five?" I asked, "What would your parents think?"</p> <p>"What about my parents? Does your dad still keep an eye on me?" she retorted, "You have to know, I still love him as much as you do, and if he knew he would be hurt, he would kick the ass of me."</p> <p>"Will your parents still kick my ass if I had known that we would have been together?" I asked, "I didn't say I couldn't live with youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
