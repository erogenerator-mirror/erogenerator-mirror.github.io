"The way you lick my face you do not need my mouth to feel the taste of your cock on the way up."</p> <p>I could never get enough of his mouth on my lips. It was like magic.</p> <p>After a minute (the next few seconds) I could get the words out without a single sign of strain on my face or in my voice. "When we did do this we stopped at the airport; did you know your father and I were on the way to the airport?"</p> <p>He didn't answer at first but continued to gently stroke my face and nibble my ears.</p> <p>"Of course, I did." He kept caressing my face with one hand and kissing me deeply as he said these words.</p> <p>"When our luggage got here we were at the same place. I had packed our bags so they would not get separated and it had not been a long drive to the airport. You had to wear your clothes and the flight was uneventful. It was a great night, and you were a little jumpy and excited. I made some small talk and offered to let you shower with me for a while. We left the airport and then walked to the first cabin and went to have one of the rooms decorated. When we came back we stripped and made love, the way you said and the way I have done ever since - on our first date."</p> <p>He said it so slowly his words made me tingle with anticipation and I started to feel so aroused in just a few seconds. It did not take long before my sex filled panties were soaking. I was sure it would be the hottest sex either of us had ever had and we both knew our sex life was at its most intense.</p> <p>I leaned my face in to his and gently kissed him the mouth. I couldn't believe how much this man had been wanting this since we met in middle of town. I had always thought I was "the girl of his dreams".</p> <p>He continued. "When we got to the room we did another 'naked' kiss; this time I got naked and he took off his clothes. You were right when you told me you had never seen another man's cock! His cock was as long as I remembered mine and thicker.</p> <p>I had always thought it looked more like "Bill's" but seeing him naked now and knowing you were watching me I was almost giddy with the excitement I could feel. He was stroking me gently and with both hands and the feeling in my sex got more and more and more erotic and I was getting really excited by the time he got down to business.</p> <p>He looked down at my nude body and thought to himself that I must be his to do with whatever he wanted. It took several minutes and then he moved back up to me. We kissed deeply and then slowly started kissing again. I felt the softness of his lips, the warmth of his face and the hardness of his cock pressing against me. That was all I needed. The feeling that I was getting from this was pure sexual stimulation. When he placed his mouth over the tip of my aroused sex I started to move my hips and he stopped. He moved back away from me and said.</p> <p>"That's ok, I wanted to be with you tonight, but I never thought we could continue this way."</p> <p>He said it so sweetly that I could not believe how much he had meant it. He said, "I wanted to make you feel like you were my first and I know you want the same thing."</p> <p>I said, "Then let's get this show on the road!"</p> <p>I wanted to please him, but I couldn't ask him to take my virginity. I knew he was a virgin. I guess he saw the same as I did about you. I wanted to please him and make him wish he had never made his first move. I told myself to take the words that I had to be honest.</p> <p>"No, please, make it last!" I said, but I am so excited, he is so good in bed and with someone as beautiful as you I am going to lose myself in it."</p> <p>He kissed me again and said, "I will tell you that I will always keep you happy and I will always take care for you until you are happy and content, until you have a baby and you wish for me to be happy too.""</p> <p>I smiled and said, "You will always be our first and maybe even the last."</p> <p>I leaned down toward him and said, "I am going to really like you, even if we're both virgins."</p> <p>"You're on!" and I put my arms around his neck and he kissed me again. We just pressed our bodies together and when I felt his manhood slowly rubbingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
