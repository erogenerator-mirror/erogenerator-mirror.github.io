It was James, we all said hi to each other as we entered his house. James looked at our nakedness as he handed us the towels and began drying us off, "Lets get your clothes off". He directed us both towards his room and began pulling the towels from the walls and closet.</p> <p>"Jenna," James was pleading a bit, "don't take too long." I turned to face him, he looked as I had when in the bathroom, he reached out and held my hand tightly, "Oh, my."</p> <p>I laughed and tried not to think about the wet room. Jenna looked back at me and grinned, she looked me up and down before she got up and stepped close to me and kissed me, I closed my eyes and kissed her back, she slowly ran her hands up and down my front, she wrapped her arms around my neck and gently pulled on the front of my shirt, my cock began to grow under her touch.</p> <p>I pushed her away, "No, you have to go with James." I turned and walked into the bedroom leaving her there, I took the towels from the wall and helped her undress, her breasts were beautiful, I couldn't help but wonder about the ones she had in the pictures? Damn, I hope it was real, I hope her nipples were real in my imagination.</p> <p>Her pants came off without a fuss and she stepped into the bed as I laid beside her. My hands were on her tits, squeezing them, they were nice firm breasts with nice nipples. My hands were squeezing her nipples as mine were on her stomach. We laid there, her nipples rubbed along my chest as I ran the tips of my fingers over her belly button, "Jenna," It was difficult because she was so excited but she smiled as she pulled my shirt up and off. I let go, "Lets get into the shower." She pulled me onto her as I stood in the shower, we kissed, I pulled down her panties, she spread her legs, I kissed the inside, her clit was swollen and she was getting wet.</p> <p>We spent some time kissing, I ran my hands over her belly, up her legs, then moved her back and held her, she slid my head between her legs, I sucked her clit into my mouth and started licking and sucking on her love button, she began to push me away, I resisted as her hands held me firm and continued to suck, her legs were shaking. She pulled me up and kissed me as her tongue found my lips and ran into my mouth, she tasted salty as she did. Then I was on top of her, her lips tasted sweeter. I pushed my cock into her warm sheath, her legs closed around me, I felt the pressure of her muscles, I began to fuck her hard, she had one hand on my head holding me to her body. I grabbed her tits as hard as I could, I was biting her nipple as she held me, she was beginning to shake, I couldn't stop, I shot spurt after spurt of my load deep inside her body.</p> <p>We both fell on the bed, I was exhausted and she felt weak from the effort of lying on top of me. I kissed her lips and her head and we kissed several more times.</p> <p>I looked over my shoulder and she was staring at my face, "I am sorry, I really am."</p> <p>"No, it's ok, I wasn't mad."</p> <p>"Can't you see she wanted it, she looked at my eyes, and I looked down at her.</p> <p>"How do you feel?" I asked.</p> <p>"Really strange."</p> <p>"I feel good, I don't know why I didn't push you away, it felt good, we should do it again." she smiled as she reached back and touched the hair that covered me, I reached down and touched her hair.</p> <p>"Do you want to?" I was hoping for a replay of that first time, I loved every movement of it, and again, she reached down for my cock, it didn't seem to want any more of it since the time before.</p> <p>"No, no I'm good, I just didn't." she smiled a little, "We have to do it again, but not tonight."</p> <p>"I want to do it again, please?" she pushed me back to the bed and lay on top of me, I felt the lips of her cunt on my cock; I slid my cock into her warmth. It went in a little deeper than before, I wanted to feel her, her heat and wetness. Once I had all of it, I pulled back a little, looked down; there was a little cum on the inside of her thighs. When I pulled out, I looked at it and smiled. I felt the juice in her cunt, myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
