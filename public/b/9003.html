Let's just fuck!"</p> <p>"I need you too much now. My clit needs a little action."</p> <p>"I need this. But just a little, I'm so aroused," She said before lowering herself down, engulfing my cock in her warm wet pussy.</p> <p>We both moaned in ecstasy, feeling like the world was falling away as she began to slowly move her hips up and down. As she moved up and down on me I moved my hands to her beautiful round ass, and caressed her skin all over, all the way to her puckered rosebud, which I teased as I kissed her, nibbling on her ear and neck. I kept one hand on her hip to support her on me as I started to move my hips on top of her, pushing my cock hard inside, feeling each inch of my cock as I pushed into the warm depths of her pussy.</p> <p>I could feel her pussy starting to tighten around my cock as the pleasure started to build in her pussy, slowly pushing out and then pushing back again, her breathing becoming deeper and heavier. It was driving me insane and I knew I couldn't hold back much longer either.</p> <p>"Mmmmmm, fuckkkkk!" I yelled as my cock started to swell inside of her. "Oh, yeahhhh!" I moaned as my balls prepared to explode.</p> <p>"Ooooo!" She moaned back, her head back and her eyes closed, her pussy milking my cock now, causing me to cum deep inside of her hot tight pussy.</p> <p>Exhausted, I pulled out from inside her and walked across the kitchen back into the living room, laying down beside my best friend's mother.</p> <p>"Thank you baby, that was amazing," She said to me, lying next to me and cuddling with me.</p> <p>"Well, I gotta get to the gym as well," I said.</p> <p>"Oh, I'll keep myself close to you, I'll be right outside," She smiled back at me and snuggled closer to me.</p> <p>I was already feeling very guilty about what had happened. It made me feel more guilty and I needed a little time to think. I couldn't sleep, so I decided to go home and see a movie. I wanted to stay in touch with her, but it seemed to me that she needed some relief.</p> <p>On Friday afternoon I called Amy into the office while I worked on a new client list and she was excited.</p> <p>"Oh, good news, Amy, I finally got a new client today. He's a big hit with the marketing department today, and he's got a new model that might be worth a few extra bucks."</p> <p>"Excellent," She replied with excitement in her voice, looking at her watch on the kitchen counter. "Is he worth three bucks?" She said as she glanced down at her watch and grinned broadly once more.</p> <p>"That much, huh, what a coincidence. I'm happy, that's a bonus." My new client, Ryan, had been pretty easy on me.</p> <p>"Well, do you mind if I call him?" I asked as I turned off the computer.</p> <p>"Of course not, I want what you've been earning, and I'm in the process of filling out my new survey. I think he owes me one."</p> <p>"You can pay me anything today, but you have to pay him something tomorrow and every day now in an extra hour."</p> <p>Amy grinned and nodded her head.</p> <p>"Of course, I'll be sure and be on my best behavior at every step of the way," She then added, "You get what I'm buying today."</p> <p>I smiled and nodded to her.</p> <p>"Sure." I said, as I walked out the door and down to the gym to get my bag.</p> <p>A few minutes later, Amy was sitting on the treadmill in just her pink sports bra and a pair of pink running shorts, her legs crossed and her feet on the bench, giving me plenty of time to talk to her.</p> <p>"That's great, I feel really good. I'm actually looking forward to meeting Ryan today."</p> <p>"You can meet him tomorrow, he's been looking forward to doing this for months. Are you going to meet him?"</p> <p>"Yes, I think so. He'll probably be up in his room talking to some new models or something."</p> <p>"Well, it's good to hear you admit to doing some work and getting something out of it."</p> <p>"Yes, it's good to hearâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
