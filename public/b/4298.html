Mabel said, taking the bottle from him, making a show of licking her lips.</p> <p>"I know." He said, taking his arm off of her leg and turning to look at her, his expression showing that he hadn't forgotten what had happened. "I got a little carried away before."</p> <p>"I'm glad I could help." She sat back up, rubbing her thigh against his and feeling him respond. "I guess it was an accident..." She laughed, kissing him on the lips. "I know why guys aren't all that into you, especially when they know you were doing that to me."</p> <p>"I thought you were going crazy." He smiled at her as they stared at each other, finally breaking apart.</p> <p>"I'm fine, and I'm sure you're not." She giggled as they walked into the living room. Closing the door with a hiccup, Beth looked up, her face flushed with excitement.</p> <p>"Hey you!" She squealed, falling on her bed.</p> <p>"Hey." He smiled, sitting on her as he joined her. "Is this why you took on women?"</p> <p>"Oh, no." She shook her head, smiling innocently at him. "But every once in a while, I like to have a boyfriend." She closed her eyes, resting her head on her hands. "Do you have girlfriends?"</p> <p>"What is the point?" He reached over to kiss her hand, brushing it against his face. "I have a girlfriend. I just wanted to get to know you..."</p> <p>Beth pulled away, leaning back against her bed. "Do you...?" She asked, her eyes twitching.</p> <p>"No, you can't!" He pulled back from her, his hands covering them when he walked into their room.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" His voice was almost pleading.</p> <p>"Yes!" She grinned at him. "I have been on dates before, and they never lasted long enough!"</p> <p>"... and now?" He smiled, looking up at her.</p> <p>"I think it's time for us to get back to the way we used to be." She laughed. "Are you sure you don't mind?"</p> <p>"I suppose I could keep going if you don't."</p> <p>"You know what I mean!" she grinned.</p> <p>"Yes, please." He agreed, his voice full of emotion.</p> <p>Beth looked up at him and pulled him towards her, her eyes filled with wonder. She put her hands down on his hips, running her thumb over his jeans. "You're so hard!" She laughed as he leaned down towards her, his arms around her waist.</p> <p>"Bethany, I don't know what came over me, but you look so gorgeous!" He gave her cheek a soft kiss. "So nice!"</p> <p>"I'm glad you like it." He grinned as he leaned down, running his hand up her cheek to her lips. His lips caught hers, feeling her give a soft, loving smile.</p> <p>"I love you, Bethany." He smiled. "And I will always love you!"</p> <p>"And I always will love you." She smiled back, her head resting on his chest.</p> <p>After the second kiss, he ran his hands from her back up her side, slipping his hands through her long blonde hair. He lifted his head to kiss her cheek, then her nose. When she tilted her head upwards, he pulled her towards him, kissing her mouth. Bethany's arms clung to his sides as she pushed back, groaning softly to feel his weight. She had a feeling that he was falling in love with her too, but then when he reached for her, she shuddered.</p> <p>"Baby girl can't get enough!" He murmured, pressing her against the wall.</p> <p>"Don't... hurt me!" She pulled away. "I'm not on the pill." Her voice was shaky.</p> <p>"It'll just hurt for a little while, but maybe we can let it be our last time." The last part made his face fall, but they didn't talk about it.</p> <p>"It was your eighteenth birthday. You were nineteen years old when you did." She pointed at him. "Your dad gave you the condoms..."</p> <p>"He never said I could wear them!" His voice was almost sad.</p> <p>"But he knew for sure." She smiled. "I could hear you taking off that rubber at birth. I remember how much it bothered him, but he didn't say anything about it, so... there you are."</p> <p>"What... are you making me say?" She put her hand on his face.</p> <p>"If you're asking how my cock gets hard from thinking about you, it helps."</p> <p>Bethanyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
