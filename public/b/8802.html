This was the whole plan. This is what it was all about. There, I said it. There was no going back now. This was pure, unadulterated happiness, as if I was living it again.</p> <p>"You just let me try to make it right. You have to do as I told you and you don't get mad."</p> <p>In that moment, I did want to make it right. I felt that if I tried to make it right I could never feel this good again. This is what life was all about. This is what life, I could do with this. I felt the tears well up in my eyes as I nodded. If I could give this life something I would do anything. Anything I knew would make this better than I could ever dream of. It was so simple, the one thing I wanted was for it to end. This was all about happiness and love.</p> <p>But my heart and body had other plans.</p> <p>When I felt the first tear sliding down my cheek, I could see I was about to receive a new gift – a man's penis. It had been years since the last time I had been with my first penis.</p> <p>"Please, honey, now, you have to put it in me."</p> <p>I could feel my insides begin to stir as I waited for my new toy to enter. I didn't know what to expect. It began to go soft but it stayed hard, and when the tip slid in, I felt every single centimeter of it penetrate me, as if it were real. I knew the feeling well, from being a girl and being stimulated by a man's penis, through my body, was a unique experience for me. The feeling was incredible... the feeling of being inside a man was beyond anything I had felt before. I began to wonder how far she would go.</p> <p>It wasn't long before I felt her weight, as she got me to her knees, forcing me down on my back as she pushed it in a little deeper. I heard her moan softly as something wet and smooth touched my asshole. I looked up to see her moving my cock around inside her, as she sat on me, giving me a massage in all the right places. I leaned into her as she let her weight settle on me. My hands reached up to touch her breasts, my fingers running between her breasts as I found her nipples with my fingers. My hands went to her ass, pulling her down on me. As the cock inside her slipped in, the feeling of this new penis inside me was absolutely heavenly. It didn't feel so bad when she was as wet and as hard as it was when I was. Just wonderful, like something out of Star Trek and as wonderful as it was in real life. I felt her tighten up a little around me then pull her down a little further, so that her pelvis was hitting mine and I could feel every single inch of this new penis on my entire torso, stretching out the most wonderful sensations I had ever felt. She was getting closer.</p> <p>"Oh, my God," she said before she had to turn her head away as she began to breath in long, slow gasps. Her breasts swung as her pelvis moved slowly up and down on mine.</p> <p>"Do you want me to continue?" she said breathlessly. I closed my eyes, trying to think of something to say. It didn't make sense. This was the thing that mattered, in me and I wanted it all.</p> <p>"Yes....."</p> <p>I was too tired to be embarrassed, so I responded. "Can you?"</p> <p>In answer she moved more than an inch forward, taking me in deeper with each thrust.</p> <p>"OH!" I exclaimed, as I felt her pubic hair touch mine and it felt as if I was being penetrated there, on my body.</p> <p>She moved faster, her pelvis grinding me every which way. The sensation of this foreign feeling in my body was too much. The feelings I felt were beyond description and I couldn't hold back anymore. I moaned and writhed under her, trying to get as close to her as I could. Her vagina was sliding up and down on my pubic hair as it was getting faster. The head of my cock had begun to turn red and I looked down to see that it was leaking.</p> <p>"Please, honey, finish me off," she said softly. "Put your legs on my shoulders, please. I want you to come inside me."</p> <p>It wasn't long before she was moving, slamming down so that she would have gotten her new penis inside me. I had never felt anything so wonderful. She had a way of tightening her vagina over me just like I had done to her, so that it seemed to move with me each time she got us right.</p> <p>She was panting hard now, while my dick—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
