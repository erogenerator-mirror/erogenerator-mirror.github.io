Did you do this before?" I asked.</p> <p>"No you didn't. I'm really happy to be doing it with someone different but I'm not that special. I've been saving it all for your boyfriend." he replied.</p> <p>I was shocked but I just said, "I do hope you have a good time. See you later!"</p> <p>And I turned to go to the bathroom. I heard the shower turn off and I couldn't help but start to feel really hot. I looked in the mirror and noticed that the bathroom was full of steam from the shower, which caused me to take another hard look in the mirror as he had his eye on me. I knew from the start that it would be a fun night, but I was going to make the most of it.</p> <p>I walked back out to the living room and saw that he had his dick in his hand, which was slowly stroking up and down. His left hand was around one of his balls and his fingers were stroking the tip. I looked at him and said, "I knew I shouldn't watch if you wanted to make this a nice night."</p> <p>With that I got to the middle of the living room and sat back next to him. He leaned in and kissed me. This was getting sexier than I thought it would. He said "Let's try again." and pulled off his shirt. I wasn't sure how to react but I was quickly doing the same. Our lips were almost touching. I let my right hand wander down to his chest then moved up so I could touch his nipples. They were still hard and he felt it. I kissed my way down to his stomach then moved down to his jeans. I ran one hand up the leg of his jeans until it brushed against his dick. He said, "Well, I guess we both know why we're going to take the party to another level."</p> <p>"Yeah, let's hit that now." I replied</p> <p>He pushed me back to lay back on the couch. I was pretty drunk and my legs were very unstable so I knew there would be some resistance. He pulled my jeans down and they fell around my ankles in a pile. I didn't know what he wanted as I had gotten up in the middle of the room to pull my shirt off.</p> <p>I was still in the middle of the couch sitting across from David. He had a beer in his right hand and a glass of wine in his left hand and I looked down at him. I think his hand had just been under the hem of my shirt and was touching my bare breasts. After a few seconds I realized that his hand had slid up my leg. I looked up at him with my big blue eyes and said "You can't touch me." With a mischievous grin on my face I smiled at him.</p> <p>By then, I felt his hand slip off my breast.</p> <p>"Well, come on now! I'm only going to ask you one question."</p> <p>"No, David. I'm going to ask you."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"I'm going to make both of you suffer for a little while until you're rested up enough to take it." I said as I took a sip from my glass.</p> <p>"But what will you do if I can do that to you?" he said.</p> <p>"Well, I'm getting there, you'll just have to make that happen." I smiled and said</p> <p>With that he pulled his shirt over his head and started to undo his shorts. When he got that off his dick got in his hand, which was already growing in front of him. He started pulling down his boxers, which I saw were now hanging on one leg. He pushed them down a little and I saw his now huge cock come into view. It was huge and uncut and it stood up straight and proud.</p> <p>"Wow. How big is it?" he asked.</p> <p>"It's at my size." I replied</p> <p>"It'll probably make it worth it." he said jokingly</p> <p>So I asked, "So what are you holding back?"</p> <p>"Well, I think it's important for you to see what you can."</p> <p>With that he took both hands and placed them flat on the table next to the table and started to stroke his dick.</p> <p>I was shocked at first but thought "Wow. It has to be 9 inches long". I said "It's 8" thick and it looks just like your dad in the movies."</p> <p>"It's thicker than his dick and when my hand is stroking it's about 2.5" across and 3.5" long."</p> <p>"I'll bet this would make that difference." he said</p> <p>I couldnâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
