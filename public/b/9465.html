I knew what she wanted, and the way she used my tongue did what she wanted. She started to moan and she started to tremble so I could hear very little because the bed was rocking, and I knew that would make her cum hard. Her body began to tremble, and I knew that my cock was ready to burst also.</p> <p>I stood up on the bed, and moved my body up hers to straddle her chest. I had her still pinned against the bed, so that I was sitting between her legs, with my erection at her lips. Now, this was another way that, with the proper technique, I should take care of my own needs too, and it didn't take much of my attention to make my cock swell and get hard again so that Gina could reach it. She reached out her free hand, and I placed the head of my cock at her lips.</p> <p>She looked up at me as if she was a little scared, but I knew what she wanted, and I let go of her head. I let her look up at me as I slowly and carefully began to move my cock in and out of her mouth, and as I did, she tried to get me to go faster. My balls started to tighten, and I thought she was going to start to blow me again in a hurry, but she didn't - she just held my cock with her lips and mouth and gently caressed my balls.</p> <p>That was it. I couldn't hold back, and I came. I came in a huge orgasm. Gina's body went from shock to ecstasy as her own orgasm tore through her body. My jism pumped out of me, and she swallowed every drop.</p> <p>After both of us finished coming, Gina stood up, and I lay back down so that she was on top of me, and our lips were back to licking and sucking each other's. We kissed and licked each other's faces and our bodies. I felt the love she felt for me, and I knew that she felt the same way about me at the same time.</p> <p>Finally, I managed to roll to our sides, and my penis slipped out of her body. "Wow. That was some head, and you're not half bad yourself," I told her.</p> <p>"I've been thinking about doing this for a while now," she said, her voice still a little breathy. "Your turn again."</p> <p>Gina got up off the bed and stood astride my penis in the air. She lowered herself down on it, impaling herself on it, and taking a moment to savor that feeling of her wet walls gripping every inch of my cock. She leaned back, reached down and grabbed my shaft, and pulled up until she could reach the head of my penis with her hand. She held my dick upright in the air and then began to fuck herself on it, taking her other hand to caress her clit as she did.</p> <p>She took her other hand, with my cock still hanging in her hand, and pulled at my balls, which pulled my cock free of her body again and made her come up off me. She sat back down on the bed, and reached between her legs, to play with her pussy. Gently, she lifted one of my balls, then the other, and massaged my nut-sac - and I felt that I really wanted to come, and she knew it. She lifted my cock, and lowered herself, then sat back on me again so that the head of my cock was on top of her clit, and she started to really start to grind herself into me. Each downward movement of her hips caused her clit to bump against the surface of my penis, which was being stimulated very slowly.</p> <p>She continued to rub herself against me, and her body started to react again to my dick. "Gina?" I whispered. She stopped, leaned up, and kissed me on the lips. I kissed her in return, and after some more tenderness, she said, "I know I'm not very experienced, but you are. You felt like you have my pussy right now, and you're going to make me come again."</p> <p>"Good," I responded, and began to lift her up to her knees. I felt that my dick wasn't quite fully hard again, and I wasn't sure I could hold out much longer. She put her hands on my chest, and I could feel the bed move, as she leaned back against the pillow beside me, and began to ride me.</p> <p>Gina leaned back and had her arms wrapped around me. "I'm sorry that I let you go so far before today," she said, and we kissed, while I continued to lift her, pushing up and down on my dickâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
