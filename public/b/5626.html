I think this place has been on his mind for some time."</p> <p>With that comment, Gail and Jana took her into the house and put her in a room on the first floor. The floor was bare, a dark, dark spot on the floor. Gail was feeling dizzy and needed a little rest.</p> <p>"What the fuck am I going to do?" she thought as she watched.</p> <p>When the lights were turned down and Jana started to undress, she saw that Gail was already standing there naked.</p> <p>"Let's go!" Jana said, jumping up and running upstairs to get Gail. Gail followed Jana into her bedroom.</p> <p>"Why don't you get those clothes off? You look hot."</p> <p>Gail quickly removed her clothes. Gail loved her black bra and panties and stood naked in her bed, legs slightly spread and hands by her side.</p> <p>Kneeling a few feet from her, Jana smiled as she saw the beautiful black bush surrounding Gail's pussy.</p> <p>"So pretty," she whispered.</p> <p>Gail stepped forward and put her arms around Jana as she kissed her. Gail put her arms around Jana's neck and moved her tongue in and out of Jana's mouth. Gail felt a shiver running down her spine as Jana slid one hand to cup Gail's breast. Gail moaned as Jana's finger circled her nipple. Jana's hand moved so that two fingers pressed against, along where Gail's clit was.</p> <p>Slowly, Jana moved her fingers, rubbing Gail's swollen clit as Gail continued to thrust her tongue into Gail. Gail gasped as Jana found what she needed. "Oh God," Gail moaned as Jana's finger found her clit and rubbed it while she worked her fingers.</p> <p>"Harder," Jana whispered. Gail couldn't speak and started to moan louder when she felt Jana's fingers pressing hard against her clit. The sensations were intense, making her want to cum immediately.</p> <p>Gail was on her hands and knees, with Jana massaging her breasts and kissing her body. She opened and closed her eyes as a shiver ran through her body.</p> <p>Happily, Gail opened her eyes and looked down at Jana with a smile. "What did she do?" Gail panted.</p> <p>"Don't worry, hon. Your pussy won't wake anybody up," Jana said, pulling her hand from Gail's clit.</p> <p>Standing beside Gail, Jana lowered herself and sat on Gail's stomach. Gail's head was still resting on the bed as her mouth opened and she closed in on Jan's nipple.</p> <p>"Oh God, I'm so excited," Gail whispered. Her body shivered each time Jan's fingers pressed, rubbed or pressed against her pussy.</p> <p>"You're such a tease. Why are you having fun? I should have known," Jan laughed.</p> <p>"I'm having fun," Gail agreed. "I like being teased. Now I want you to get all of me, don't you?"</p> <p>"You're such a tease. I'm really getting turned on here."</p> <p>Gail's hands moved over Jan's body. The touches were warm and sensual, moving on her skin, feeling her, feeling what the other woman had to offer. When Gail moved to Jan's hip and moved her way down, along the outside of her thigh, her body arched and she gasped.</p> <p>Jan leaned back, closed her eyes and enjoyed Gail's touch. Gail wanted Jan to feel what she felt, and that's exactly what she felt. Gail moaned as Jan's fingers were massaging her nipples, rolling and tugging on them, while her tongue licked around the nipple.</p> <p>"Oh yeah! Suck it! That feels so good," Gail moaned.</p> <p>Gail moved her hands down and around Jan. Her fingers cupped Jan's clit, flicking it back and forth as Jan's tongue danced around her breasts. Gail felt her breath coming rapidly as her body responded to Jan's touch. As Gail's pussy lips separated, she felt the slippery moisture running between them, making it easier for Jan to lick the pussy juices.</p> <p>She wanted Jan to take charge; to take charge of her lover, Jan, as she wanted to do with her. Gail's pussy had always been a little sore when Jan had taken it slow, but Jan's touch was making her feel incredibly sexy.</p> <p>Sitting up a little, Gail moved her hands to Jan's hair and began to combâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
