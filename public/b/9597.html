I had no idea what the future would hold at that moment. Would she just kiss me, touch me, suck me at the same time, and take my ass and fuck me until my ass was numb. I wanted to move closer, closer, as her hands on my body began to caress me. She pulled me in for a kiss, but no touch at all – not a peck at first, as she would have expected, but a slow, gentle peck, and she kissed me softly.</p> <p>"I just want you to be here...just to kiss me. It will go a lot in your favor."</p> <p>I was still, and I'd never felt so vulnerable.</p> <p>"Ok, now. I just want you to...touch me...make love to me."</p> <p>I felt my arms being held at my sides as Karen's lips were now inches away from mine. This wasn't my first time being kissed. This time it wasn't about my ass…no, it was about giving the young man at the door a real live cock, and taking the young man by his throat and pussy. After a few moments of this, I felt Karen's warm breath on my cheek, and she whispered through her mouth, "Now."</p> <p>I felt the soft touch of those soft lips on my cheek, and then she kissed me deeply. Her kiss was like an electric spark that passed through my body and through my body, and I felt myself being lost to the moment. I felt as if I'd never cum. I knew I was ready. I felt so happy! I wanted more...wanted more. She released her kiss and moved across my shoulder blades, then began to trace the line of my chest with her tongue. It was like a sweet torture – every touch was making my heart beat harder and harder. My body felt as if it were on fire. I'd never felt this about anyone. I just wanted her so more – and more and more. My heart began to pound against my chest with every breath. But she was moving so slowly. I felt like I was coming down from heaven...I was being driven crazy by her passion. My body was aching to feel more...to be kissed...my lips...my sweet pussy. I let her lick my entire body once – twice – and I would have let her do it that night if I could have…but not quite yet.</p> <p>At that moment she was gone. She was all that I wanted and needed; I was totally in her power. All I needed was to be desired in return. I would make her wait with open arms and let her make me melt. All I needed was to be hers.</p> <p>I couldn't move. I could only lay there and kiss her all over the place, but somehow, I couldn't get myself to do those things, even though I needed this to happen…but I wanted it to. I wanted to be free… free to touch…to taste…to fuck…to have her...to do things to me...to her. She was such a perfect combination of a sexy young woman and a sexy young man who I could have cared less, and who would have loved to do things to me. I was beyond that, and I knew I could no longer leave that door alone with her. So I laid there, allowing her to take her time and explore me. As she licked around my breasts and to be sure her lips would go where she wanted them, I knew she was the one who I wanted.</p> <p>But she seemed to want to take the same journey with me. As she was still kissing my neck, I felt her arms slide up my shirt and cup my breasts just beneath my bra. Her fingers were still soft but so erotic that it was almost a painful squeeze; it almost seemed to be the cause of me not being able to move her hands. As I felt her fingers playing with the flesh of my breasts, I took in a deep, shuddering breath and felt my nipples harden. I felt a shiver down my body as her fingertips played softly over my nipples, and one of them was moving across my stomach to the junction between my navel and hip. I felt it there – just out of reach – and it made me shiver. Karen moved her hand around slowly and carefully, and she stopped at one point after touching my mound, and I felt her fingertips running down my stomach with feathering touches, and then back up on my pussy lips. I lifted my hips to pull her fingers into themselves, and she stopped her touching, and looked up at me. I wanted this...it seemed so wrong...so forbidden...and so good...so, please...for us to do it together... I knew now that we would—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
