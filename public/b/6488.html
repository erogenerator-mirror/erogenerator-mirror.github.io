I wanted to plead with him to just give me another chance but I guess that wouldn't be a good idea because with just one step and just this once, I knew I was in control. The one thing I didn't want was any more to lose another chance of losing myself to him, I couldn't bear to lose one more.</p> <p>He kissed me tenderly, deeply, not breaking the kiss for a second. "I think you should go now. Don't you think I want to take my girl out to dinner and a dance?"</p> <p>I was so confused. "I'm sorry." I muttered.</p> <p>He let out of the kiss. "Do you really think you have to do this now? Of course you didn't have your chance. You couldn't have made a decision you couldn't have made."</p> <p>I couldn't deny that. "I didn't make a decision about this morning. I was afraid you would think I didn't want you to do what I'd done. Why are you so surprised?" I asked.</p> <p>Allison kissed me deeply. "I've heard from the guy who told me on the net that you thought about sex. I've heard from the girls in a chat room some how, and I've heard that you told them too. But I know for a fact that you've never used it yourself!"</p> <p>It was Allison! Allison was always there! Allison was always there! With all my heart, my body was telling me that I had to get up.</p> <p>"I'm so stupid!" I said aloud. "I didn't know this!"</p> <p>"Of course, the other girls in the chat room have all told me and their stories have all been exciting as hell." Allison said as she started pulling her clothes back on. "I can't believe you've gone back!"</p> <p>"No, I did not!" I told her, not wanting to be anywhere but back.</p> <p>"I thought you would never be! I can't believe that was you!"</p> <p>I turned around to try to explain. I was not sure what to say. I couldn't really say that. I was speechless. "I had no idea." I started in again. "Please forgive me!"</p> <p>"I really think I don't hate you!" Allison said, standing up in front of me again. She had gone out and bought me these big, beautiful, black, satin negligee, and now I was looking at her in my mirror wearing nothing but a bra and my panties, my breasts straining to have to lift themselves out of the cups for support.</p> <p>I tried to be gentle, to stop thinking about going home and letting her show me what men make. This was crazy, why did this turn me on so badly it was just a little bit scary?</p> <p>"I thought maybe when you got home you'd just be mad," Allison said. "Not that you'd blame me. I didn't mean to push it."</p> <p>"Yeah, if you really didn't think it, I would have said something."</p> <p>"Maybe I would have pushed you," Allison replied. "I'm sure some of those men of your age would like it if you'd just go back and do it again." She had me again.</p> <p>"No!" I protested. "The way you feel about sex."</p> <p>"No, I suppose not!" Allison replied. "I'm a woman, of course I can want it. I need it. I'm your girl, after all."</p> <p>And then I was still thinking that. "But the way your feelings about sex just took over yesterday. I think about you almost as much as you touch me. I think about you touching me."</p> <p>That didn't sound too reassuring.</p> <p>"You really think I should go and do it again?" I said, trying to calm down. I turned around at last and looked in the mirror. "I think I should stop before I totally lose myself to you."</p> <p>"It's not that," Allison said, looking for my reflection with a puzzled expression. "It's that if you don't let me, I will. I won't force you." She reached under the bed again. "Do you still want to go through with this?"</p> <p>"I don't really want to," I told her, getting out of the bed again. "Don't force me! Don't force me at all..."</p> <p>"I don't want you forcing me," Allison said again, almost as though the words had been said only for my benefit. "You want me to just take your underwear off and get dressed."</p> <p>"No!" I protested. "You're serious! I didn't think of it. I thought maybe I should just take them off."</p> <p>"Honeyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
