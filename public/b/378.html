She was really into it and she pulled herself up her body and held onto the base of my cock, her legs wrapping around my hips and holding me deep inside her and pushing down against my pelvis. She was trying to thrust it in and make me fuck her as my cock filled her and as her orgasm finally subsided.</p> <p>"Wow,"</p> <p>"Wow what,"</p> <p>Her eyes rolled back in her head as she lay back on the bed, her hair covering my chest and legs.</p> <p>"Wow I want to get fucked," I said with a grin.</p> <p>My cock sliding out of her body and I lay on my side, facing her. I stroked her shoulders and her back and I caressed her tits and stomach and her thighs. She was beautiful as she closed a hand behind my cock and rubbed the head against her pussy lips. I slid it in a couple of inches then stopped.</p> <p>"No...not just yet," she said, not really feeling like that but the feeling of the moment was so intense. I pulled out and moved off the bed again.</p> <p>"Where are you going?"</p> <p>"Don't you know," she said, looking at me, "I want to try one of each."</p> <p>"You want me to show you what I can do on your penis," I said. "So I think you deserve it." She lifted herself up on her elbows and stared at me, taking a deep breath, "I think that's too bad you don't have a real penis," she said.</p> <p>"No, there is something special about one," I said smiling. I moved my hand down her stomach to her pussy, finding it warm and ready. I teased her cunt and then I pushed inside her a few times.</p> <p>Just then the phone rang. I grabbed the phone and answered it.</p> <p>"Hello,"</p> <p>"Miss, I'll call you when I'm sure you're coming down," I told her.</p> <p>My cock slipped out of her cunt making a puddle between her thighs, as she moved to sit on the bed. I pulled one of the little white panties from my pocket as I stood, watching her move.</p> <p>"You can get it if you want," I said.</p> <p>"Thank you," she said.</p> <p>She stood up, her legs still a bit unsteady from what had just happened, and put the panties on, putting her heels on next to mine. She pulled her dress up and looked around. I turned the key in the lock, pressing the button all the way. I stepped in and closed the door behind me, pulling her towards me.</p> <p>"Do you still want me," I asked as we kissed.</p> <p>"Yes I do," she whispered.</p> <p>"Good," I replied.</p> <p>I put my arms around her waist and pushed her back with my still hard cock, slipping it down so she could feel it pressing hard against her ass. I placed my mouth in front of her ear and breathed in her ear. I rubbed my cock against her ass, pushing down on it so it rubbed against the back of her cunt, making her feel the wetness. We both took a soft breath.</p> <p>"I need a break," she said softly as she pulled my head away and looked into my eyes.</p> <p>"I can do that," I replied. With that, I got onto my knees, my cock sliding in between her thighs and she moved down to kneel before me.</p> <p>"Are you ready to try some other things?" she giggled.</p> <p>"No," I told her.</p> <p>"Then give me the key to the car," she replied.</p> <p>She pulled on the belt, undid the zip and let it fall to her waist. Her beautiful firm body was almost completely naked before me. She reached out her hand and guided the cock that I had just slid into her as she stepped up and sat on the bed. She reached out her other hand and I took the keys from her, holding up the two as she did.</p> <p>"There are a few things to try," she said as she got off the bed. "I'll be back in a bit, ok."</p> <p>I put the key in the lock and I stood up and followed her, pushing open the door and pushing the door shut behind us. I unlocked the door and opened it, turning and holding the door to shut it again. I closed the door and turned the lights on. They were small, about ten feet long, and three on the floor. I put my hand in one of the pockets and pulled out the condom. I put it on and I walked around to the bedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
