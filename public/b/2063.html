Krista said.</p> <p>"Well, you know me," Krista sighed.</p> <p>"I like you, too," Jazzy said.</p> <p>"I hope you get to join in with us next time," Krista replied as she walked away.</p> <p>"I'd like that," Krista nodded, then turned and left.</p> <p>A moment later, Jazzy turned around, and saw her boyfriend leaning against Jelena, who was on the couch.</p> <p>"Hi. You look familiar," Jazzy said.</p> <p>"Yes, I remember you. What are you doing here?" the big girl asked, her voice sounding foreign to her.</p> <p>"I just wanted to see what you looked like," Jazzy replied with an accent, adding, "you okay with taking the time to come over?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm feeling like I've been in this room five seconds."</p> <p>Jazzy turned to look at him, and smiled as he smiled back at her.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"It's me," Jazzy said, before leaning over to kiss him.</p> <p>After the kiss, Krista turned and kissed her new friend before stepping back.</p> <p>"Let's go upstairs, shall we?" she asked, turning to walk away so the two girls could each take the first step up to Krista's room.</p> <p>Once, they made it to Krista's door, the two girls were shocked when someone knocked on the door to Jazzy's room. It was Kajira, of course.</p> <p>"You guys are so sweet," she gushed, pushing the door open.</p> <p>"We've been waiting so long," Jazzy said, trying to contain her nervousness as she stepped into the room.</p> <p>"You've been waiting," Kajira said cheerfully, stepping inside the girl's room and closing the door behind her.</p> <p>"You didn't come get me?" Krista asked.</p> <p>"Sorry, I'm still kind of busy," Kaj said.</p> <p>"Me too," Jazzy replied as she stepped inside Krista's room.</p> <p>Jazzy sat down on her bed and pulled her chair out for her friend to sit beside her.</p> <p>"What's troubling you so much?" Krista asked as she leaned against the wall in front of the closed door.</p> <p>"Well, I haven't been spending the best part of the week alone," Krista said, sitting there quietly.</p> <p>"You like me?" Krista said, her tone serious when she asked her.</p> <p>"Yes, I do," she said, her smile growing.</p> <p>"But you haven't spent the best part of the week alone," Krista said, leaning forward to kiss Jazzy on the cheek.</p> <p>"Well, I thought you wanted to see me too," Jazzy said, looking up.</p> <p>"I do and I know you did," Krista said.</p> <p>"This is so wrong," she said, kissing Krista.</p> <p>The kiss was passionate, and it was a first moment for both girls.</p> <p>"I don't wanna keep you."</p> <p>"What's wrong with that?" Jazzy asked, putting her arms around Jazzy and leaning into her kiss, her tongue searching for and exploring the girl's mouth.</p> <p>"I feel like I need to make love to you," Krista said.</p> <p>Jazzy's eyes grew wide as she saw the meaning in her friend's words.</p> <p>"Do you like it or not?" she asked with a teasing grin.</p> <p>"I like it and I like you," Krista said, as she pulled Jazzy close.</p> <p>"You are so adorable when you're all scared," Jazzy said as the two girls kissed each other.</p> <p>"I'm scared," Jazzy said shyly.</p> <p>"Me too," Krista agreed.</p> <p>"I can't go on," Jazzy said, turning to kiss Krista again.</p> <p>"Me neither," Krista said.</p> <p>"I've never gone on with someone before," Jazzy said, then turned to kiss her friend again as her arms went around Jazzy.</p> <p>Krista didn't pull back for a couple more seconds, then got up to turn on her bedside light, before walking to a chest of drawers, taking out the condomsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
