Don't think you're going to die of pleasure," he joked. "This isn't going to feel so soft as it does now, is it?"</p> <p>He felt his breath as it left his lungs. She could feel it too. Her body still trembled.</p> <p>"N-not really," she mumbled; "I've been a while."</p> <p>"A while?"</p> <p>She knew what he meant then. A while was a long time. He was sure he was about to die.</p> <p>He wanted to die.</p> <p>"Oh no, not just yet. Let me," he pleaded, lowering himself down once more. He moved himself closer, kissing her with all the intensity he'd learned from her.</p> <p>"I need to kiss you," She said. "I'll hold you off, I promise. I'll suck you dry, then I'll..." She paused only long enough to whisper his name in his ear.</p> <p>A momentary silence fell before she heard his breathing again, and knew he wouldn't feel it. This was all too much for her. She looked up at him and, still looking away from him, said, "You have to kiss me."</p> <p>Her breath escaped from her slowly, like a sigh. The words were so delicate and full of emotion; they couldn't be real. He closed his eyes as he moved his lips to hers. The feel of her lips on his was the single best thing that had ever happened to him, and he was in a trance.</p> <p>When he opened his eyes, it was as if he'd been caught in a dream. Her face was all he had left to see. He had never known a person quite like her. He was in a dream. Her eyes were as blue as blue oceans. They looked a little different than any woman he'd seen. Their color complimented each others every expression. They looked far more intelligent. They had a kind of innocence that seemed to melt together. Her hair was the color of wheat that had no roots. She looked as if she would grow into a person at any moment, but he felt it move as she smiled and looked up. She had that glimmer of intelligence that made his heart melt in ways he couldn't explain.</p> <p>"M-mistress..." He murmured. She seemed to hear what he wanted to hear, like a little girl getting ready to be schooled.</p> <p>"Yes, my pet? Are you ready to kiss me?" She said.</p> <p>For the first time, he wanted to get out of the room, so he could think. But he couldn't, because his body had become rigid as he fought an urge to say it. He didn't want to say it. He didn't want to sound stupid. He was afraid to say it. He didn't want to say it. It would sound stupid. He felt her lips on his as he felt her. Her soft caress on his cheeks, her lips on his hands. Their tongues tangled together.</p> <p>When she broke, he was still holding back a sob.</p> <p>"Ohhh my angel..." she said, looking down at him. "I...I can't...I still can't say it. It won't make sense. I don't want to sound stupid. I know it was wrong, but... But..." She broke to her knees as she spoke. "Look at me, my pet, I'm not crying... I'm so proud of you." She ran her fingers down his face.</p> <p>"I'm a girl..." He said, trying to bring her back to the world.</p> <p>"Yes you are, my pet. And you're my girl. And we'll always be together." She squeezed her hand against the small of his naked back and kissed him once. It was the first time he'd ever seen his beloved. He had thought it might never end. After she said that to him he knew she meant it. She'd never said anything mean about him. She'd never asked him a question of him that she should have had asked him first. He knew that if he asked for her he should be truthful. There was nothing he wanted more to do in the world, except ask her, and love her as her was.</p> <p>As he looked at her beautiful face, his heart pounded in his chest as he moved back on top of her. He'd been right about a man; she was truly beautiful. And her love was so strong and vibrant. She was so fragile.</p> <p>She had a perfect heart. He loved seeing her smile.</p> <p>When she felt him touching her again, she sighed with pleasure.</p> <p>"You like that, don't you?"</p> <p>He had no reply.</p> <p>"How does it feel, my pet? I know it's wrong to be asking you that, butâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
