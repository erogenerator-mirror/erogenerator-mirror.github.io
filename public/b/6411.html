"It looks so pretty," she said, moving forward to stand in front of him, sliding her panties down her thighs slowly as she took his hand.</p> <p>"We did this before," she answered, pulling his hand and moving into his arms, turning them toward the couch. As soon as they came to her, she took his hand and guided him towards the couch, sitting the chair. He was seated when she climbed up onto the couch on the other side of him and pressed herself against him. She kissed him and their tongues did their best to dance inside each others' mouths. His hands went to her hips and he felt the softness of her ass before he cupped it firmly, letting his fingers trail lightly upward until it passed against her cheek for warmth and then back. He felt the soft warmth of her sex pressing into his leg and shuddered. He found the small nub of her clit and teased it with his fingertips, feeling it harden into a little bud until he had the softest, tightest and most sensitive part protruding out.</p> <p>"Oh God, I haven't had anyone touch me there in a long time...no matter how many men I have been with....," Alissa moaned as his fingers found her clit and pressed it in small circles.</p> <p>"Oh, Alissa..." he rasped, his erection pressing against her ass as he rubbed at the opening to her cunt. "I love your cunt, but yours is even better. I love your soft skin that just begs to be kissed."</p> <p>"Oh...please...do....me," she moaned as both of them slid into position, his cock being held in her cunt as his legs rose up from where they sat.</p> <p>She slid down his body until her hair was in contact with his lower body. He sighed with pleasure when she nuzzled his cock, feeling the warmth of her mouth on him as she opened her mouth and the heat of her mouth as she took him in. Her tongue slid around him as she drew one of his nipples into her mouth as she stroked the shaft of his cock with her hand. Their lips remained in contact as she took his cock out of her mouth and began kissing down his chest and torso until her mouth found his cock. His eyes closed when she opened her mouth fully and enveloped his head, his shaft as much into her mouth as it was in her hand as she slowly drew the head of his cock down to her throat. Her eyes looked into his as she did this, and for a second when she felt the weight of him in her throat, she closed her eyes, her face slightly distorted from the intensity of his pleasure. She drew him out of her mouth with her hand, holding the crown of his cock as it came within inches of her mouth.</p> <p>"Oh, Alissa, I wish we could do that all the time, it would be great....," he murmered as she drew him into her mouth, her fingers still stroking the shaft and her lips working the thick vein beneath the head.</p> <p>Her eyes opened a moment later, and her full lips met the head of his cock as it slipped past her lips. She slowly drew him into her mouth, holding him tightly as her tongue slid sensuously around his crown of flesh as her lips closed around him. His hand slid down from her shoulder to the back of her head, his fingers holding the skin of her silken hair as her mouth enveloped him. He felt her lips moving, holding back just a bit when he felt them touch his cock as if it were the first penis he had ever felt. She felt his pulse and heard a hiss as his muscles began to twitch beneath her. Her lips slid up and around him, the motion bringing the base of his cock down into her mouth as if it was the handle of a cock, not even his own as it drove up into her mouth and swallowed him down. Her mouth opened, slipping his cock into her throat as she held him there. Her hands came up to cup his balls as she moved up and down, rolling them gently around in her hand as she continued to suck him, her mouth sliding up and down, her fingers slipping up and down the root of his shaft as she sucked up and down his cock. She pulled at him with her lips, the sensation of her lips sliding along his cock almost as if he were holding her there, holding him as she kept him in her mouth as wide as she could. She drew off her face, but only for the barest glimpse of his eyes as she looked up into his, her finger stroking along the underside of his cock as she sucked on him.</p> <p>Hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
