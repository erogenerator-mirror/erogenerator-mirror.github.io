I fantasize about that day I fucked you on the bed of my cousin while he was getting it. I even fantasized about kissing and being kissed by him too. He was so hot for me that I can’t tell you when he was fucking me, but I've also fantasized about making love to some other guys. Just remember, whatever happens I will keep this as a fantasy of mine. I promise.”</p> <p>“Okay buddy, just wait. We still have a lot to tell”. I looked back into her eyes, and was rewarded by the vision of her naked body. Her nipples were hard and standing straight up. Her eyes drifted down to her smooth and hairless pussy lips and the wetness running up and down her thighs.</p> <p>“I hope you enjoyed it. It was an amazing day and I hope I can do this again anytime. I’ll be sure to tell my friends about this and be sure to keep this a secret with them”.</p> <p>“Y,yes. I loved it”, she said smiling back up at him.</p> <p>“I hope you want to find out about this sometime. I think you will.”</p> <p>“I would do anything I could to learn about this, no matter how taboo it is, and I’ll definitely remember it”.</p> <p>She smiled at him and said, “Don’t worry buddy, we can do this a lot in time.”</p> <p>“I promise, “ I said laughing to myself. And he did too.</p> <p>After our return to the cabin, it was late before we could relax or even take another swim. We settled back into the pool, and the sun was really doing an excellent job of cleansing the afternoon’s sweat, so we decided to go for a swim in the warm water. I went through a couple of pairs of bathing suits and put them on, in the hopes they would cover up any tan lines. I knew that the one that I was wearing the first time I wore it would be ruined when we hit the water. I got out of them and into the water and dove in.</p> <p>As the water was swirling around my feet, the coolness felt good to me as I treaded water in the cool water. I pulled off the top and dove myself in. The cool water felt good to my skin. I felt all the water rushing around my body. I took my time treading water as it felt great and I felt safe.</p> <p>When I reached the pool, I went inside. There was a bench right out there on the deck area. I climbed out of the water and stood by it. The cool breeze seemed to cause me the most when I first came onto the surface. It felt so good to relax under it; especially since I had been doing this all this long. It felt as good as I would have if I had a cock in my hands.</p> <p>As I was standing there, I heard a voice call my name. I turned around to see the owner of the voice, standing there.</p> <p>“John, is that you? That looks like your friend from the hot tub,”.</p> <p>I reached out and took the plastic wrap off the bench lid and tossed it towards him.</p> <p>“Hey buddy. Hey man, what’s new this far out? No surprise there, I’m here alone”</p> <p>“Yeah, yeah, it really looks like the hot tub is here”, he said.</p> <p>“I thought it was,” I said as I looked at him.</p> <p>He was smiling then. I thought he would smile a big smile of victory now but he didn’t. He just looked happy to see me there with him standing there.</p> <p>“Come on over with me friend,” said the owner to him once more.</p> <p>I followed him outside to the pool. It was really cool, and I was about to feel warm enough underneath to have a swimsuit.</p> <p>We walked over to the bench that was in the middle of the pool and sat down.</p> <p>“I want to make sure you are comfortable there buddy,” said the owner as he slipped out of his shoes. “I want to put these on just so you can keep swimming,” he said as he stood in front of me.</p> <p>He had on a pair of briefs that had the crotch cutout in the front and one side cutout in the back.
