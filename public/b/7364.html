He asked, not knowing that she could. She nodded and lifted up her skirt to reveal her panties. He reached out and pulled her panties down as he had expected. He had to stifle a gasp of astonishment as his gaze dropped to her bare nakedness. She looked stunning, his mouth dropped open and his hand started to shake. He could feel himself getting wet and his cock stirred in his pants, he was beginning to feel embarrassed about being caught.</p> <p>"How about we go into the spare bedroom?" He asked her.</p> <p>"Ok" She smiled, and we walked in his room. They didn't talk much, just sat on his bed, each lost in their own thoughts.</p> <p>"So this will be your first time?" He asked looking at her.</p> <p>"Yes, very special" She answered, still not a word out of the car.</p> <p>"Do you want to be my first?" He asked, knowing he shouldn't have asked like that. But he was so turned on that he hadn't had sex with women before.</p> <p>"Yes, I want to fuck you" she replied.</p> <p>"Ok, just sit back for a minute." As he sat he could only stare at her. She came over and stood next to him, leaned down and kissed him softly on the lips. She pulled away, "we'll go further tonight" she whispered to him. "I want us to do this so gently."</p> <p>He sat back on the bed, still not saying anything. He watched as she walked over to the side of the bed, picked up a scarf and held it up to her neck, covering her eyes.</p> <p>"I can't" She looked back at him, "I really don't want to do this. Will you let me go?"</p> <p>"No, I'll tell you if you want me to."</p> <p>She turned and walked to the bathroom, he could hear her shower running. He thought of her as he looked at her naked body. It was a very soft beauty. He imagined being in her bed, with her legs spread, her soft lips, her body against his. He moved down from his chair and sat on the bed as she came back into the room and sat next to him. "So, did you enjoy fucking her?"</p> <p>"Very much, she has a sexy pussy, very wet indeed." He replied back as she sat down on his lap with a smile on her face. "Did you like fucking her?" She asked leaning back against him.</p> <p>"Very much" he replied, he ran his hands over her body, "very much... you know, very nice and sexy."</p> <p>"How did you know that I like to fuck a woman?" She asked, now leaning on his side, one arm across his chest, both facing him.</p> <p>"I found out after she told me about me fucking her, that you liked to feel women touch you? I found out that you like women to touch you?"</p> <p>"Oh yes, you know about that too don't you?"</p> <p>"Yes, very much!" She said as she turned her body so that he was leaning over her, he kissed her soft lips again. They both felt very good, now she was so wet. Feeling her body against his felt so sensual. After a few minutes of this, she lifted her body up to his, she could feel his hardness under her pussy. He reached down, rubbed her pussy lips with his hand, as she rubbed his cock.</p> <p>"Oh god" She cried as he started to rub her now. He thought about his wife's sexy body, it was so beautiful. He thought of her in his arms, kissing his lips as he rubbed his cock. He started to move his other hand up to find her nipples, he rolled them between his fingers, pinching her a little. He couldn't take it anymore, he had to feel her hard nipples on his hard cock.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I couldn't make you come" He said as she lifted her hips up to him, and he slid his cock into her pussy.</p> <p>"It feels so good you can do this all the time."</p> <p>"Yes, but first make me come." He told her as he leaned his head on her breasts, pinching her nipples between his fingers.</p> <p>"Oh don't stop" She moaned, her mouth hungrily sucking on his. They both came shortly, then sat up and caught their breath.</p> <p>He sat up and they kissed, long and hard.</p> <p>"I have another surprise for you, but I've got to go." He got up and went out of the room, while she lay on the bed moaning. She knew something else. She saw a note attached to the door on his bed stand. She looked at it then at it again a few minutes later sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
