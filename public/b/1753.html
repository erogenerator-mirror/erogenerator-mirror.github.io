"Do you like being naked in front of me?" she asked, leaning her head back, so she could watch. I did, and she smiled widely, looking down at me and rubbing soap over my chest. "Do you have a favorite position of yours?" she asked. I said yes, and she moved to my lap.</p> <p>Her ass just barely covered my already hard member. "I want you to fuck me," she said, looking over her shoulder at me. "Oh, and tell me what you like the best, you little slut. Say it, sweetie."</p> <p>"Just, just, just do me," she told me, sliding her body closer to mine and giving me a quick peck. "Oh, and I will ask nicely," she added, leaning in and kissing me.</p> <p>The warmth, moist press of her mouth to mine made my knees wobbly, and it took all I had not to pull away right then. This was one gorgeous woman, and I could not imagine what it could be like, but, I knew all I wanted to do was kiss her. And, I did, kissing her back for a while and letting her arms go as we wrapped our bodies into one another again.</p> <p>It felt great to find an open, loving woman to share my shower, but I had to feel her. I turned over, letting her slide under until I was facing her. She moved her hands out and began washing my chest and shoulders. "Do you want to fuck me now?" she asked when she came up for air. "No," I said, sliding my arms up across her chest, and then back down over her ass and hips in turn. I felt her body sliding against mine again, and reached around her to play with her nipple. As I rolled her nipple between my thumb and finger, she lifted her ass from my lap a bit so I could slide my middle finger on up the crack of her ass. She felt wonderful, and the hot water began to run down her body. I continued washing her, letting my finger wander up until it brushed against her anus.</p> <p>"Oh," she said, sounding uncertain. "Oh." She looked around and saw the washcloth lying in the corner. "We can soap both of us up," she said, and I reached up and began to dry her off. Her hands went immediately to her own sex and her back went further up my legs as I continued to stroke her as best I could.</p> <p>As I finished her, she looked back at me, smiling. "Do you want me to put soap on you?" she asked. I reached out and took the offered finger and began to slowly stroke it. It only took another moment before she had her arms up behind her back, and then reached down and began to run her fingers through my hair. "I know a good place for your cock," she said. I felt a little ashamed, but she seemed to be enjoying herself so much that it would not have mattered, and I was grateful. Then she ran her hands around to my face, brushing it gently so we could kiss.</p> <p>We continued that for a while that way, kissing and touching until the water ran cold, and we stopped when it was getting cold. Still holding each other's hands, we stepped out of our clothes—both of us wet and ready to shower again. She reached into the shower and turned it into a warm, wet sauna, so the steam would escape the main room into the bedroom. After showering and drying each other off again, I joined her on the bed. "Do you promise not to laugh at me, when we finish making love together?" I said.</p> <p>She was wearing one of his terrycloth robes, and she reached up slowly and hung that in front of her as I sat on the bed and watched her. "I might laugh at you," she said, turning herself so she was facing me. "I don't have a problem saying it. You've a good looking one. Why don't you come and sit next to me for a while?"</p> <p>"I don't think I've made it here before tonight," I said. "And, if I wasna'y to have been with a woman."</p> <p>She looked up at me with her hands on her hips, letting me see her nervousness. "You're not going to...," she started, looking down at her feet as if she was afraid she would slip. "I just want to..." She hesitated a little. "I just want to do it with you," she said, turning back to me and reaching up, putting her hands behind my head and pulling me down on for a long kiss. "I just need you to be comfortable," she said, breaking the kiss.
