He looked down at me, looking into my eyes. It was hard for me to look at him after that. I was afraid he would think the way I thought he did. He had looked at me after we were together.</p> <p>I just stood there for a few moments, letting him look at me, knowing he couldn't deny me, wanting him to see me as I was.</p> <p>"Do you love me?" he asked, breaking the gaze.</p> <p>"More than you'll ever know."</p> <p>I smiled. It was hard to explain, I'm not sure why, but after what I saw in that second with him it felt so right. He loved me and was so happy with me.</p> <p>"Do you love me?"</p> <p>I nodded eagerly. I looked at the clock. It was about 10:00 am. I didn't even bother to dress.</p> <p>"Get into bed. I'll be there in a minute."</p> <p>I stood up, my pussy still dripping from his mouth. I quickly undressed, taking my time so I didn't embarrass myself, or any of the guests. I crawled onto the bed in my panties, feeling the coolness of the sheet on my skin. I curled up into a ball, unable to move or think. As I drifted off into a deep, happy sleep all day long it never crossed my mind to feel the excitement I had felt the evening before at the pool.</p> <p>THE ENDâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
