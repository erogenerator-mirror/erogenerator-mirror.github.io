Thank you... Thank you for everything."</p> <p>But just the tiniest of things, she'd never spoken so softly for a man's first time. This had somehow broken her.</p> <p>And he was going to, too.</p> <p>"Come on, sweet girl," he said. "Time to get this dress off you..."</p> <p>She felt light-headed. She couldn't say what she thought would happen in the next minute while she walked to the bedroom. She was completely unaware that, as her body began to respond to his command, she found herself almost shaking, her heart beating faster and her cunt throbbing with excitement.</p> <p>Finally, after what seemed an age, he told her to take off her blouse. So she did. There was no bra, and no panties underneath. Just the simple brown, cotton teddie, the one that barely covered her breasts. It would not be far. And then, finally, she saw it. Her father's mother... he was...</p> <p>Her knees buckled. He was right. A large part of her wanted... oh, she couldn't... she really wanted to say, "Oh, yeah, Daddy, take my bra off!" She didn't have to. Not just so that he'd know what to do. Not because he'd already said so, but because she wanted him to. He had, had to. She was trembling, too, her heart beating frantically, her cunt afire. Finally, she pulled the teddy off her. She felt so wicked, standing there in her bra and panties - naked, naked, in front of her Dad, who had just walked in on them! And now, not only her, but his - as well, as, she found now, she had turned him all around!</p> <p>So that the night... as they'd all watched her and played with each other, the sight of it, of the two of them, his huge cock pulsing, the taut naked ass and those tits he'd just seen - it could not be over too quickly, but she could never let go of him. He was her father's age! How could she be her biological father?</p> <p>She was shaking, and it was all a rush; she couldn't help herself. As if it were her own body that was responding to the situation she was in, her hand wandered down to where they were joined, and she began to rub herself. She closed her eyes and opened her mouth, and she did it like she'd been doing it herself: opening her eyes and looking up at his face, and then to his cock... She just knew. She could feel it. She was really sure her father's cock would do the same! She wanted it too, and she needed to feel it. It would do anything for her. And soon she would feel it.</p> <p>And she was right.</p> <p>His cock, though, was not just it. It was big and hard and...</p> <p>In spite of everything that had happened to her in the past, the reality that, though small, in the back of her head was what would set her off: she wanted it. She wanted to feel it, to touch it, to... the things it had been doing to her!</p> <p>"Mommy..." she said, "it's okay." She didn't move away. She didn't need to. For a moment she felt his hand on her shoulder. She closed her eyes. What was wrong? What was the big deal? But she didn't even try to get up. She felt her knees weaken and she collapsed. And then he was there.</p> <p>"Oh, my goodness," she sobbed, "do you really expect me to..."</p> <p>"Don't even say it. Daddy loves Mommy."</p> <p>"And?"</p> <p>"Yes," he said, "and it means everything to me."</p> <p>"And why does Mommy need... to be this good?"</p> <p>"Because she's so perfect, and she's all mine," he said, and she felt a tear slip down. "I love seeing her and her Mommy, and she loves me too, but that's not all that's important to me."</p> <p>"What does she want then? A Daddy?" she asked, but he just put his hand over her mouth. "Don't say that! Don't let it!"</p> <p>"I don't know, mother. I guess I just don't know anymore. I never thought..."</p> <p>"I did," she said, "and it's my fault. You never should have let me feel it though, you always said it was wrong. I don't blame you for wanting me," she said, smiling broadly. "And I can't blame you for wanting me!" She turned to run and he put hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
