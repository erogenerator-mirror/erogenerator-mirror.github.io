There's a couple over by the barn that needs to get things warmed up before dinner. I'll be quick." She picked up her bag and headed out to the garage with the others.</p> <p>"It looks like we'll have to make that ourselves. We'll get supper ready first."</p> <p>The other kids didn't even care how much they ate or how the rest of the weekend was going to end. They all got up and cleaned the house as a group. Mike was sitting at the kitchen table, and Tina went over to sit by him.</p> <p>"What took you so long?" Mike asked her. "My room's the one on the left."</p> <p>"Well, it's right over there. How about you?"</p> <p>"I think I'll stay home. I hate it when the first time I get to play this game," he said as he lifted his fingers to his mouth.</p> <p>"I'm glad your Dad took the liberty of locking you in your room for the weekend. What happened when you locked me in my room?" she asked him sarcastically.</p> <p>"I was hoping that you weren't going to say anything. I think I just put a little bit of a spark back in your eyes."</p> <p>"I was looking forward to it, Mike," she said walking over to the counter and picking up the two pots and pans that littered the cupboards. Her hands made their way into the pots and pans but she couldn't use them. 'I'm so tired of this shit. I'm going to bed.'</p> <p>"I'll make a pot of coffee. Coffee, water, juice, coffee, tea, whatever you want, it'll be ready in fifteen minutes. I gotta say, we have grown comfortable in each others company. I wonder if we're even close to the same age."</p> <p>"I want you. I'm tired. Go to sleep and I'll do whatever I can to make it up to you."</p> <p>"I'll give you a few minutes, if you'd like to join me," he said with a giggle. "We'll talk when you're ready."</p> <p>"Okay. I guess I can stay a while longer." There was more chuckling from the others, and Tina's mouth parted several times before she could say anything. She stood at the counter by the sink putting the pots and pans to the side in the kitchen sink so she could wash herself off.</p> <p>Mike sat down in a chair across from her in the kitchen. "Well, what do we have here?" he joked.</p> <p>"What?" she asked, not wanting to believe that he'd taken the initiative.</p> <p>"Come here," he said leading her towards him. He sat down next to her, placing his arms around her. "I wasn't kidding. Don't you feel the same way?"</p> <p>"Nope," she smiled as she leaned down to kiss him on the lips and he pulled her into his arms letting her kiss her way down his neck and chest. When her lips came in contact with his nipple and she rolled it between her thumb and fingers, which made Mike moan.</p> <p>"You like that, don't you," he said huskily.</p> <p>"Yes, I do. Very much," she replied, rolling the other one between her thumb and forefinger.</p> <p>"We'll finish this tomorrow?" he asked. She smiled as she rolled them both over so that she was on top, and he was straddling her hips.</p> <p>"As soon as we find someplace more private, okay?" he nodded and she kissed his mouth to remind him that it was time to do as she'd told him, and go in search of someplace to change clothes. It was almost ten when they were both ready to leave, and she thanked Mike for his kindness.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>Two Weeks Later</p> <p>Mike came home that evening as soon as he could get away. The next morning, he made his way to the barn to wash the coffee off the windows to the right. He had finished cleaning up their house, and had set out the picnic hamper by the back room at the back of the house to wait for his new lover, who she'd decided to call Kathy, to join in.</p> <p>She and Mike had spent several hours talking and laughing, as they ate their breakfast in silence. Mike wondered what it would be like to be the older partner with whom he'd shared life together. Their discussion went on for almost two hours, and when it was up to him to take her home for the night, she didn't want to part from him. He was ready to call her at the drop of a hat and take her gently to bed, so he letâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
