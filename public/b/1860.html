As her body went into quakes, I pushed into her as deep as I could, her tits pressing against my chest and her soft lips on my throat. The kiss got long and hot and the sounds coming from our mouths filled with passion and love.</p> <p>We both felt the passion building in our dicks. We could feel it in our bodies as if we were making love instead of fucking. It was as if we were taking our time. We kissed until she came again and I felt hot waves inside me. The waves were strong and as I felt them, my body got weak again and I slumped against her.</p> <p>She turned and kissed me again. The passion was gone and once more we shared a tender kiss.</p> <p>We stayed with one another for some time but we did not move from there. After we finished our kiss, I kissed her on the lips and we shared a breathy kiss so we could taste. We parted our kiss with a gasp and she kissed me again.</p> <p>We lay there on the bed, breathing heavily and not able to move. We lay there kissing and touching each other. My dick got hard again and she was getting it ready for a fucking. I moved over to her and we moved so I could kiss her with mine, as I had done that day yesterday, when I held her waist in order to kiss her. After a minute, I moved my tongue back to hers and we kissed lovingly.</p> <p>Then she moved her hand to my dick and stroked it lovingly. As much as I loved touching her, I didn't want to cum inside her. She seemed to sense what I was trying to do but wouldn't make me.</p> <p>"No, it's OK. I want to hold you. Please hold me, I like it," she said and I nodded. I kept kissing and stroking her body. At this moment, I knew that everything to do with her was right. This is our best fuck ever, that I love. This is our chance to do something that we can never do, anything except this time.</p> <p>Slowly I moved my body on top of hers. My dick had no resistance anymore. It wasn't only soft; it was rock hard. I pressed it between her legs and she spread them invitingly. I pushed in just slowly so as to heighten the feeling. It went in very easily with the wetness of my body and the pressure from her cunt.</p> <p>She let go of our kiss and opened her mouth. I kissed her mouth again and we tasted each others tongues. As we kissed, she grabbed my ass. I moved my body and she lay on top of me. Our arms reached out and embraced each other. Our breasts touched and I felt her hard nipples press into my naked body. My cock remained hard and it slid along the length of her pussy.</p> <p>I held her close to me and we kissed till she came again and we came to again. This time was slower and our movements were less frantic. I pushed her back to lie on top of me and we stayed like that for a long time. We kissed and touched each other.</p> <p>"Let me suck your cock," she said. Her voice sounded as if she was in pain.</p> <p>I kissed the part of her that I was not yet giving up to her and I got up till I was behind her. I took my dick and held it just near her wet pussy. I pressed it inside her pussy and started moving. The feel of that cock was amazing. I was just about to cum when I stopped and rolled her.</p> <p>"Put my legs over yours," I said and she lay on my chest, just looking back at me. Without hesitation, she spread her legs and I entered her. It was so smooth and hot as she was wet. I moved slowly and with slow strokes. Her juices were mixing within my cock when they hit her inner flesh.</p> <p>I liked how tight we were and we got more aggressive. I kept it going longer and she kept it going longer. My cock was rubbing all over hers and it almost started hurting. The feeling of that pussy enveloping it was really feeling like being fucked. She was loving it.</p> <p>We were breathing heavily on each other and I knew we had to slow down. We did not want this to end too soon and we could not move for too much. I pushed her legs further and got her feet on my shoulders. I held them and started fucking her again. Her mouth was open and her lips were trembling.</p> <p>My whole lower body was hot and sweat was dripping on her. I could feel it in my dick and felt the muscles flexing all over it. My body was also feeling hot and my whole body was getting tired. I was trying to control my climax this time. It is my first time to do aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
