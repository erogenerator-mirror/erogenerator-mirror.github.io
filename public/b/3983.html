She added with a soft whisper, before continuing. "I've been feeling self centered and self exposed since I've done this, that I need to go find a quiet place to finish my self centered feelings." The words, when spoken from her own mouth, were so soft that he lost his erection for a moment. "Please."</p> <p>"Okay." He stepped forward and pulled her to him, and with great gentleness, he kissed her forehead as he wrapped himself in a tighter embrace. He loved the fact that he had turned her into the lover of his own decision. He loved it. It made him feel alive and wanted. "You need to come home." He whispered it with such reverence that it would seem inappropriate, but she could still feel it in her heart.</p> <p>"Home?" she teased back at him. She felt so safe, so vulnerable, and loved in that moment. He had promised that he would always be willing to honor her wishes, and in return, he would help her into her rightful state, when she really needed it. "To where?" she asked.</p> <p>"To be with you...and I can't stop myself from loving you." His breath was warm, and the sound of his deep voice, combined with the softness of his embrace told her that he truly meant it. She was not sure if it was because of his words, that he had found a quiet place, but just how close he had made them, she did not think she would be able and would need to go. He held her in his arms, and at the same time, she heard every word coming out of his lips.</p> <p>After an awkward pause, he looked deep into her eyes as he kissed her. "I love you...and I want to do anything and everything I will ever do...to be with you."</p> <p>She loved everything about him. She liked the feeling of his mouth and hands caressing her, knowing she had never felt anything like that before, and just as a matter of fact, she couldn't be mad at him for doing that to her. "I don't really understand you..." she trailed off.</p> <p>"You can't. You will tell me, and I will stop." He replied as he gently rubbed her chin with his thumb. He gently raised her face slightly and looked deep into her eyes, where they glowed. "I'll be gentle with you..." he stated as he kissed her forehead softly. "Will your body react to me?" He asked with a bit of urgency in his voice, wanting her to feel a bit of urgency at the feeling of his warm lips on hers, he loved it when she just melted into him, and he knew that she would react the same way.</p> <p>"All I'll feel is that wonderful feeling of your body, and I'll never let it go." She told him with her eyes wide in excitement and lust. He just looked at her with such understanding, she felt so safe with him in his arms, and she felt safe being his. Their heartbeats were so close, and she was so content with him in his body. She felt safe; and yet she felt as if everything was so foreign, and so distant. She felt a little overwhelmed but couldn't really say it.</p> <p>He just smiled as she blushed, and she realized she would have felt that way with him if he hadn't been so gentle and patient. "I know that." He replied softly. "I think it's time I put a stop to it." He leaned forward and kissed her lips gently, and she responded in kind. He wrapped his arms around her and they held each other as they kissed for what seemed like forever. Feeling his mouth move down...the tip of his tongue sliding over her lips, she closed her eyes, savoring the feeling of being held and loved, without really knowing how it happened.</p> <p>"Don't take that the wrong way, please. I think I want this to go on for a little while." He whispered with a smile as his lips moved down, leaving her wet, warm...the feel of his hands on her body made her pussy clench as his lips caressed her again, and she felt herself getting aroused by it all. She wasn't sure what feeling it was; it was not something she needed to experience in the slightest, but she liked the feeling of his kisses all over her. She felt as if she herself would be the first one to get laid, and she was certain she wouldn't want it to stop...not really. She felt the need to make love with him once again, and she was certain she didn't want him to see her as a sexual being, and that she would be in no way ready to go that path.
