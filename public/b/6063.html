Come to my room, naked so I can enjoy yours... we'll see what the evening brings," she offered.</p> <p>I tried to hold it back but, it was too late, my cock was fully hard now, hard as steel. "It's not the weekend!" I said, getting to my feet and leaving her to go and find her a dress of hers, "And I'll need to shower and wash my hair," I added as quickly as possible but before I was halfway out of the bathroom, I found her leaning against the bathroom wall as I turned on the shower.</p> <p>My cock was already straining as it began to twitch, thinking of my girlfriend and she naked and wet and feeling her body pressed up against mine as I stood in the shower, naked. My fingers were already working in time with the movements of my body as my mind began to wander again.</p> <p>I was already imagining getting naked and then fucking her, feeling her body on top of mine, feeling the water splash against us, feeling my cock being rubbed against her body. I tried to think of other ways to make love to her but nothing came to mind.</p> <p>After the last of my shower, sitting on her bed, watching the television, I saw my phone blinking in front of me, but I really wasn't interested in the program at the moment and decided I would call her when I could find a time to get in to talk with her.</p> <p>Maybe I was the latter, but I knew enough about the world to have an interest in anything sexual at all. It was just a matter of time before she'd be calling, I thought.</p> <p>Just for an hour, I thought and then, "Maybe when we're done..." I had heard it and I couldn't wait any longer.</p> <p>And just before she called, I got off my bed, naked, and headed back to the shower.</p> <p>I had thought of having sex with my girlfriend a little while ago and decided with a few drinks in me to wait, but now the prospect had come to me... it was too late.</p> <p>I stood in the shower, shaking a little, just a little, and watched the water trickle down my stomach, through my pubes, down my legs, and onto the shower floor. I didn't need to think about it - I loved everything about that shower, and it made everything else so much more real.</p> <p>I was just enjoying the feeling of my cock between her legs, rubbing, pushing, caressing, feeling the water on her pubes, under her thighs - and I suddenly wanted to do something else.</p> <p>"How does it feel?" I asked when we were in the water in the bedroom and felt her take my hand and place it between her legs. "Is it okay?" she asked.</p> <p>"It seems okay. Now I think I'll enjoy everything!" I responded and let her turn around to sit on the edge of the bed. It took me a moment to understand what she had done and what her intentions were. "I want to take this up to my room, feel the power of being naked with you." I added, trying to take what I had just said down.</p> <p>"You want to do this for me?" she asked, looking at the wall clock and smiling.</p> <p>"Yes. I want to do this for you," I agreed.</p> <p>"Let's go," she said and reached down and gave me a little push and then turned around to face me, taking me in her arms, and kissed me in the center of the room.</p> <p>"I'm so excited," she said with a smile.</p> <p>We had moved to the top of the bed when we turned into each other and our lips met, our hands and arms touching, hugging. "We have to do this," she said and kissed me again, "Or else they won't come until we both have the time..."</p> <p>"I want to do this for your own," I said, "but we'll have to wait a little longer."</p> <p>"We'll have to wait if we get home tonight," she said as we kissed once again.</p> <p>"Just say when..." I replied and kissed her again.</p> <p>"I'm going to wait the next five daysâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
