"You'll do it?" she said, eyes locked somewhere off the side of her face, her head almost bobbing on her shoulder. "Don't worry!" she reassured, "I won't have to see it!"</p> <p>"But," she added, "I can get to it."</p> <p>"If you wanna try, try it and, if you don't like it, we can leave." She looked at me, "But if you do, it's okay." She leaned against me for about five seconds before turning to turn on her side and facing away from me, "I don't want you to see it," she said, "And it's okay." She looked back. I could see the faint shadow of a blush spreading over her, "Well," she continued, "you can see and I want you to see." And she slowly, ever so slowly, turned around, spreading her legs apart, and turning away. "See you in a little bit," she said, "and no touching."</p> <p>I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Two beautiful women were offering me their wares and offering a man. But, despite his embarrassment, he was actually turned on. And, from all the orgasms I'd given him, he didn't think it was fair that I had to be touched as well.</p> <p>"That's an invitation..." I teased.</p> <p>"No touching!" she said in my ear, "You know that's wrong!" She turned and sat on the bed with a smile. "I thought you might be in a better mood for this, but there're going to some conditions," she said, "First, I'm here with my husband tomorrow and I want to have fun!"</p> <p>I laughed. "I've had a lot of fun, and I'd like to share that with you." And I leaned down so that the tip of my nose was just inches from hers. She made a gesture toward me with one finger, "What are you up to?"</p> <p>I was nervous, "I was just hoping to be a bit alone."</p> <p>She reached out and put one hand on each side of my head. "I'll be your little sex toy. You won't need any help doing anything, will you?" she said with a laugh, "I promise. And, for that, I'd like to just do this..." And she pressed her lips against mine. Her kiss was slow, her tongue snaking out, caressing the outer edge, "... to make it even better?"</p> <p>I was in shock. I didn't think I'd ever do anything this erotic but, here goes, "Okay." I wasn't sure what I'd expected for some sort of a relationship but, the truth is, it was nothing. I wasn't sure how I felt about all this but, as far as I knew, there must have been some kind of a weird kind of intimacy in it. I pulled away from her, trying to remember what had just happened, and looked into her eyes, "You're all I've ever wanted. And you're my best friend, and you just made it even more exciting. It's like you wanted to have sex, to have fun and I wouldn't let you stop me. Like I said: it's wrong."</p> <p>Her arms were around my neck and her mouth was against mine, and I reached behind, grabbed her ass, and pulled her pussy against my face. "It feels good to have you as close as you make me feel!" I joked. "So warm and soft and soft, right on my mouth!"</p> <p>"It's not so much to me, but I like to feel your mouth on me when you kiss me like that."</p> <p>"Let's try another first," I said. "Would you like to feel my tongue on your pussy?"</p> <p>"It might be a while", she said, "if I can get that tongue tip between your lips. It's been a long time."</p> <p>"That's not what I meant!" I said. "And, by the way, I wouldn't want to have your husband in the same predicament as we've been in." I smiled at her. "And, if you like to be touched, go ahead."</p> <p>"It will be nice if you have that tongue of yours inside my pussy!" My smile faded, and I was afraid that someone might see the flush in my face.</p> <p>"No, I will, I promise." I had to be careful what I said, but I think she sensed a little more than just trust that I still trusted her.</p> <p>We kissed again and she spread her legs, "Wellllll, have to admit it, you don't haveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
