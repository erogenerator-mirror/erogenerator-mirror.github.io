He rolled his head on my shoulder as he lay, holding my face in his hands. We spent a long time talking about the past several minutes, and then he rolled over and sat up. He was breathing heavily. When he was settled, he asked me if I wanted a drink of water. I nodded, and he went outside to get a bucket of something. When he returned, he poured me a glass and handed me a drink. I drank mine greedily. I had been in a state of mind where nothing but a light went on, and I had to get over it!</p> <p>I looked at him and he asked me how he felt. "Good, bad, and yes, I am all right," I managed. We sat in silence for a while, and then he said, "I wish I could have said something a little more profound about you. I wish I could have made it clearer, for whatever reasons, to you. Your life is wonderful. And you are smart. I wish I could have made it clearer. I wish I could have been the first person you've ever been with."</p> <p>I smiled at him. "I'm not the first girl I've been with. And I'm not even the tenth girl. I'm sorry for assuming you don't feel the same way."</p> <p>He reached over and put his hand on my leg. "I don't think it's the same."</p> <p>We sat there in each other's arms for a while. "This can wait, until we're back in school. We have to figure out how to be together, and work it off. I can't believe this is starting to become our regular life."</p> <p>He looked at me and smiled, and that look reminded me of a movie. "This isn't a movie. I know you are going to be okay with me taking advantage of you, with both of us. I can't believe that is possible. When you were the first one, you went out with me and then we were just good friends. But, you're going to be okay with this. Your life is better now."</p> <p>The smile he gave me told me he was sincere, and I felt proud that I was his first. I put my empty glass down and sat next to him. He pulled the blanket over us and we lay there, holding each other. We smiled at the new dawn. I thought at my dream. This is the first real person I met, and I don't have a soul to share with. I think I am glad I met you, and I love youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
