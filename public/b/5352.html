She felt the heat of his breath on her spine, it sent shivers up her spine and the shiver was broken as she began to cum again.</p> <p>"Fuck, yes, oh yes," she growled, the words trailing out. "I'm cumming, cumming. Go easy, just fuck me," she urged him, her eyes rolled up into her head as she continued to shake. She bit her lip, she would hold on till she could calm down some, but her excitement was growing with each passing moment. She wanted to feel him deep inside her. She wanted to take him hard and deep, to feel him fill her pussy with his seed, he'd never known she was capable of this. He needed to be inside her. Wanted to feel the last tremors of pleasure as her pussy clenched around him tightly. But, there was nothing that he could do about it, he withdrew completely a few inches before thrusting again, more quickly this time, harder and feeling the sensation of her body shuddering with ecstasy, his hand instinctively reaching over to her nipples for her and he sucked on them.</p> <p>"Yes, baby, I'm cumming. Don't stop, I want this for you."</p> <p>Her words were soft and sweet, he'd never even considered them as of true meaning. He was lost in the sensation and the feelings she evoked, the electricity of the intense pleasure. His whole body felt like it was on fire, and despite himself he could feel himself trembling, feeling his cock pulse in her pussy, as it filled her and she screamed with pleasure, the words sending electric waves of pure pleasure through him. He had no idea how long he was going to last. She had been right on the edge for some time, and that feeling was finally at the verge of taking him over and over once again. He heard her breath become short, her body tremble and shake, her face cringed and with each thrust forward and withdrawal, her juices running down his balls and legs, her body convulsing wildly, bucking on his cock.</p> <p>It was all he could do to refrain from crying out as he felt himself explode inside her once again. And this time was not about him. He had done his best to not cum inside her, in fact, it had been some time since his ex-wife had been able to cum so much. He'd never let her have an orgasm like that, never, never, ever, ever. It was so intense, it had been intense, and the fact that it was his that was doing the fucking, it seemed so natural that it felt natural to him, a fact only his ex-wife could know of. But, as he looked down at her beautiful, flushed face, her eyes rolled into closed lids and her hands holding on to his hips, he was sure that what he'd just done had somehow caused her to have an orgasm. It had been his cock that brought it the most intense pleasure. He'd felt the sensation, so strong that he could almost hear his ex-wife making the loudest noises in the world above the bed as she was cumming and cumming and cumming. He could do nothing but groan, the words spilling out onto her as she came again and again, the waves of pleasure washing over her body. It had been his cock that had caused her to cum. It had been his cock that had caused her to cum while he was fucking her. He could feel the pressure of cum inside her as it pulsed and throbbed between them. It had just been his cock and his ex-wife's pussy, it had felt natural. But, as his penis throbbed, it was hard as a rock, and he didn't think his wife would be able to take another one. Her muscles spasmed and jerked and clamped together, gripping him tightly. He watched as her mouth fell open in a silent scream and her hips bucked wildly from the intensity of the orgasm she was so willingly feeling.</p> <p>He had made little conscious effort to remain standing, his body shaking, his cock still hard as a rock while it pulsed in the tight grip of her pussy. He couldn't have even imagined going soft as his cock throbbed, the pressure of his heart pounding against his chest and his cum was still pumping out from his balls. It had been the one of those moments that no matter how hard he tried, still had the effect of sending his cock racing inside his ex-wife. When she came, she came with such force, she looked so different from her usual self, he was having trouble believing that she was his wife, his ex-wife that he'd just fucked.</p> <p>He had tried to stay still but couldn't stop his hips from thrusting intoâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
