Ahhhhhh!" The two of us climaxed one of my favourite things: a scream or moan but no coherent sound, a cry or even a sound to get the ears tuned on. Finally we stopped and just lay there, recovering and kissing as if it were the most natural thing in the world. "That was amazing," I finally said with a soft smile.</p> <p>"Oh!" she replied with a laugh. "That was something else."</p> <p>"That was absolutely amazing," I continued, "and now," and she gave me a light kiss on the lips again. "Would you like to do this again?"</p> <p>"Sure," she said and smiled again as she got up, walked to the bathroom and turned on the showers. "Want me to try this again," she asked, "as our shower?"</p> <p>"Definitely, but for something completely different," I replied, walking up to her, giving her a kiss, and putting my hand on her shoulder and we headed to the shower.</p> <p>When we had the water running, I turned it on a small dial...</p> <p>"Oh, I'm so sorry! Oh, you were right!" she gasped.</p> <p>"Yeah, just what the fuck is wrong with you?" I replied, gently soaping every inch of her body as I fondled and caressed her beautiful boobs. Leaning down, touching her chin with just my fingertips, gently, but firmly, I kissed her lips which were very smooth. My hands slid down her body feeling the softness and texture of her body; I could feel her tremble under my touch...</p> <p>"Oh, baby!" she moaned and returned the kiss. "I am so horny for you."</p> <p>"I know," I replied, "but I have to go now; I told you to lock up, and you can go to sleep now."</p> <p>"I'll stay here," she said, "sleep with you tonight." She kissed me again.</p> <p>"I'd rather you didn't," I said and she laughed. She reached around to caress my naked cock through my shorts and said something to me that I probably shouldn't have said.</p> <p>"Go to sleep," I said, moving slowly, feeling her tight body around me, as if my every move was her every waking thought. I closed my eyes briefly and felt something wet against my lips...</p> <p>My mind began to wander. There was one thing that kept racing in my thoughts. The question about what she was wearing... her underwear... my imagination became very vivid... but, fortunately, none of that made any difference today. She had been wearing a light blue thong, just the way I liked it: small, barely there but so incredibly sexy on her body... as if she had been wearing nothing at all but a thin string. If anything, her panties were completely opaque and I knew she had been bare down there.</p> <p>All I could think about when she kissed me was her gorgeous, young body with its thin, smooth skin and that amazing little clit that always had a way of making me want to lick and suck on it. I had had a small orgasm with the feel of her lips and fingers so gently sliding over my lips and tongue... and now I was going to be able to lick that tiny little pussy of hers and...</p> <p>"Oh, David, are you awake yet?" I heard her whisper as she pressed her body against mine.</p> <p>"Yessss, baby," I replied, "I couldn't help it."</p> <p>"Good!" she replied, her words so gentle and loving. "I haven't been able to control myself since that first night we made love last night."</p> <p>I felt my face burning as I struggled to stay awake. "I want you," I heard her say... the tone and tone of her voice, "now."</p> <p>"Oh, baby," I heard her sigh in my mind and it was like I could feel her heart beating and beating in sync with my own. "I want you," I heard her say again. "Just like that!"</p> <p>I felt the softness of her breasts pressing into me and then her body moving up against me, making me feel like a man, like a giant, like a stranger and I loved it!</p> <p>"Oh yes!" she moaned. "Now, David, now, now!" she groaned. "I want you now!"</p> <p>"But I gotta go, baby, I have to go..."</p> <p>"No, don't go; let me stay, oh please, just stay with me, I want to feel you, I want to taste you... oh, God," she whimpered, butâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
