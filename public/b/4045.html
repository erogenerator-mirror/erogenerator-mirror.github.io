My body is going to respond to your answer right now but it doesn't mean I'm ready for it yet.</p> <p>Your body language now tells me I have just the right thing. Your hands are on me now. I can feel every inch of you sliding against me.</p> <p>"Go slow until you're all the way in, okay?"</p> <p>"That's so nice, I feel so full." Our chests are pressed together as we move together. I push in so much that we are grinding against each other. I want to feel that sensation where your skin meets mine. I don't want to push too deep because it's the wrong direction. Not when I want to enjoy the full feeling of your body against mine. I want to hold you so close that you can look at me from any angle you want until I stop moving.</p> <p>I start out slow, but it's hard for me to be sure. We're both aching and we're going so long without making love. Your breathing is heavy and we can both feel the heat from your body against mine.</p> <p>"Does that feel good?"</p> <p>"I've been wanting you the whole time I was getting ready to go slow. I know you can go deep and go fast, but it only makes it hotter."</p> <p>"No, wait. I'm going slow, but you can do it again if you want." I don't know if this is true, but I don't doubt you will be able to do it.</p> <p>"No." You're moving slowly.</p> <p>"I'm just too good. I can tell it's going faster and harder if you let go."</p> <p>"No, wait. Don't cum until you're ready." We've both stopped moving.</p> <p>"But I want to. I think I could cum again if you did it." You push yourself down as hard as you can and I can finally see you start to come. I can feel you clenching your thighs and pushing into my hardness and you moan with pleasure.</p> <p>You look at me. "Do you really want it, Mark? Do you want to make me feel like that again?" I just look into your eyes and nod.</p> <p>A tear is starting to run down your cheek. "Yes, I love you. And I love being your wife!"</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess that makes this perfect. I'll never stop loving you." Your eyes shine with pride and I can feel them grow moist. Then you start to smile. "Are you sure this is what you want?"</p> <p>"Yes." Your lips are back against my ear. "I just want to be with you again." We kiss deeply, our bodies grinding into each other's.</p> <p>"That's what the best is all about. Loving you."</p> <p>"And me."</p> <p>We kiss so deeply that I can feel your lips rub against mine and our tongues join and slide against each other. I can taste the saltiness of your body on my lips. It would be hot to kiss you in the middle of the summer, just like this.</p> <p>"Fuck me now. Cum in my hot cunt," I yell. You smile knowingly and slide out from under me and stand beside the bed.</p> <p>I start sucking on your balls to make you want to cum again but I warn you that I'm starting to get cold. You don't need any more incentive. You lift each leg onto the bed and slide slowly back into me. The softness of your cock slides on my pussy and as you start to move you come to rest against my g-spot. I can feel the start of your orgasm building and I push back against you to make you cum.</p> <p>You start to feel my body tense with excitement. Your body is getting hard against mine and I don't think you are ever going to get out the car just yet. With a groan, I start to come and we both start shaking hard. You're thrusting so hard into me that I can feel a little more of you inside me each time. You are leaning against my body as if you might want to hold on to it any longer.</p> <p>"I'm gonna cum, I'm going to cum." Your eyes darken. You're fucking me faster and faster.</p> <p>"Do it. I want it. All of it." I'm not sure if this is the right thing to say to make the perfect lovemaking partner.</p> <p>Without warning, you drive yourself into me and your hands come up to my mouth as you explode. I kiss you deeply and taste myself on you. We pull away and look at each other, you smile a little, almost proud of yourself.</p> <p>"I think I'll go for a walk."</p> <p>Chapterâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
