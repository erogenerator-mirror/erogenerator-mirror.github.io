Alyssa murmured.</p> <p>"How does the pill work?" Ryan asked, as she smiled and rolled him onto his back.</p> <p>"This is it... and everything after that." She promised as she kissed his swollen cock.</p> <p>"So it's just a pill?" Ryan was curious.</p> <p>"It's a long and complicated process of elimination." She said, as she slipped a finger into his ass and wiggled it around. "It's important to me. When will we have the opportunity?"</p> <p>"Well.... well it's not really easy... but it's worth it." Ryan murmured as he ran his hands over her lovely body.</p> <p>Before he knew it he had turned over on his back and was snuggling up to Alyssa as she lay on top of him. It was a long stretch of silence... but they knew it had to be done. All they needed to do was enjoy each other's bodies...</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Alyssa lay on top of Ryan's hard, muscular body, as both her legs were wrapped around his waist, as he held her close. She felt so connected to him... so in love with him. And now...</p> <p>Alyssa opened her eyes as she felt a soft, delicate breeze drift across her body. It tickled her thighs a bit, but then stopped just before reaching her breasts.</p> <p>Ryan chuckled and kissed her. It sent a jolt of pure pleasure through her.</p> <p>"I never... felt this much passion... before." He murmured softly as a finger brushed over her nipple.</p> <p>Alyssa shivered and closed her eyes. For a moment, neither of them spoke.</p> <p>Ryan brought his hands up and caressed Alyssa's breasts. He let them slide down a bit, and her nipples were hard little peaks.</p> <p>Alyssa squirmed a bit as Ryan's fingernails tickled her nipples. She bit her lip. She felt so alive... so free.</p> <p>Ryan kissed her neck and slid his hands down her sides, slowly and smoothly.</p> <p>Alyssa lifted her hips and slid down on him. She felt her hips rise up the bed as Ryan held her hips firmly in his powerful hands.</p> <p>Ryan rolled her onto her back. When Alyssa opened her eyes, to gaze up at her husband, he lowered his mouth to hers.</p> <p>He kissed her as his fingers kneaded her breasts. It was all he could do not to take her, to take her hard nipples in his teeth. But he needed to take a little time to savour her. After all... she was his, and he was going to have her. He pushed her legs apart and licked at the soft curls in her pubic hair, before teasing a little with his tongue. She moaned as she felt his tongue flick over her moist, throbbing clit.</p> <p>Alyssa reached up and drew her lips to Ryan's mouth. He slid a finger into her pussy. It was slick with her love juices. He ran his thumb over the bud and she jerked her hips up, feeling him slip a finger, two, into her.</p> <p>She gasped as he started to rotate his fingers inside her, pushing deeper.</p> <p>"Oh," Alyssa moaned as Ryan started to thrust his fingers into her.</p> <p>His mouth was hot and warm as he sucked on her nipples, while his fingers teased her pussy.</p> <p>Alyssa's hands were gripping the arms of the pillow, as though she were trying to pull it closer to her. They were locked in a deep sexual embrace. He lifted his hand and replaced it with his cock again.</p> <p>"Yes!" she hissed. She lifted her hips.</p> <p>Just as Ryan felt her body's need and desire to jump up, Alyssa wrapped herself around him and wrapped her legs around his hips.</p> <p>Her pussy ached as she squeezed his cock... her legs were trembling, and their bodies were slick with sweat. Alyssa knew she could not hold herself back as she held onto Ryan, close to her release.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Ryan watched the two lovers, with an intense expression on his face. He wanted to kiss her, to touch her breasts, to caress her skin... but could not move a muscle. He saw the beauty of Alyssa on the bed... the sensuousness of her body as her eyes fluttered and she let her head drop back to the bed.</p> <p>"I want to taste you again." Ryan murmured as he kissed her neck.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Alyssa slid slowly to her knees in front ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
