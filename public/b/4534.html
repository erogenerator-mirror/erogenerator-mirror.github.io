I could tell that they were both very attracted to each other. I looked over at the other window and saw the girls getting undressed in the small hallway that separates the two rooms. We could see them slowly making their way toward the edge of the room, which turned out not to be the bathroom. As they neared it, I could see that the water was running, making it just as hot in the small room. As we began to pass the doorway, I realized that, even though this was the only window, there was much more to make out. Both girls were completely nude, and they were standing in front of each other, waiting eagerly. They slowly, slowly, slid out of their clothing in front of each other.</p> <p>The girl's were even more beautiful than the ones I had earlier seen in the hallway, or more than I had been accustomed to. The dark hair between their legs began to darken as they approached each other, and they kissed passionately again, their hands playing with one another, pulling each other toward their mutual climaxes.</p> <p>They moaned and writhed together, as one, until they both came, and then both collapsed onto each other. As they did, I watched both girls lay on each other, the water still streaming down neither of them. I reached to the window to survey them and I could make out the two girls. One was tall, with a long, straight, golden blond hair. The other was shorter, a lighter blond, but with darker hair in a little pony-tail. They had been sharing showering and shaving each other, but had decided to continue, not to wait at all, although it did take more time that was required for both. They were so beautiful and so incredibly sexy. Both girls had light brown, shoulder-length hair, and the other had a very delicate complexion, that she had had, and would likely always be able to feel in her own hands. I felt sorry for them, as I felt that I should be, that I would ever be that way. I closed my eyes and imagined what they would be like if we'd been able to talk. Both girls moaned as I reached over for them, wanting so badly to hold each other in their arms again. We'd have the world to ourselves.</p> <p>As one girl held her lover's ass and pulled herself together, the other moved onto the other's back and kissed her. As she lay down next to us she asked, "So, my lover, do you realize what I'm doing with the next two hours?"</p> <p>"What you're doing with it is nothing compared to what you're doing with mine," I said, "but I think I would like that more than being watched."</p> <p>"I was wondering the same, so I'll just put it out of my head," she replied.</p> <p>"If the pleasure was any different with what's happening, the pleasure I feel right now is what it would be," I told her, "but if you just think about it, if you like to do something like what you do or think about doing in front of people, then it's all right. I have to agree with you.</p> <p>"I can't have that, and I've really been enjoying myself anyway, and I'm getting my rocks off. I can't explain how I feel about it. I guess I'm just as turned on as you are. And you don't seem to mind, do you?" I asked her, honestly, smiling as I leaned over to her with my shoulder and kissed her ear.</p> <p>"No, we're not done yet. I can't wait to do it all again." She moved to lie on her belly, and I slid between her legs. She held her arms around me as we lay there caressing one another. I could feel her own heat radiate into me, and I kissed her shoulder, feeling her shiver when she came, and she shivered again as I began to kiss her belly button. I couldn't believe our experience this first week was so new to us. I was really beginning to enjoy her company, but I was still nervous about what would come later that evening. I had hoped that she would take things slow and that she didn't have to, but she had been a little rough sometimes lately. But I guess that's what happens when you get into trouble with your own sexuality. When it's all about you, there's no stopping you.</p> <p>My hands were playing all over her backside, from her shoulders down her body. She coiled her legs over my hips as I moved between them again. I slipped a hand between her legs, and she was already wet as her lips parted in anticipation. We were both breathing a little heavily. I could feel her body trembling with pleasure. I slid one finger down her crackâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
