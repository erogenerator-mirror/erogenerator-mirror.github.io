I need to leave him.'</p> <p>'You're right.'</p> <p>'I want us to become a couple. I want us to be together. And like I said, we need to talk. Okay?'</p> <p>I didn't reply.</p> <p>'And I'll be there when the need is, with my arm around your waist.'</p> <p>Her voice had taken a sudden change of tone. A light flushing of colour appeared across her cheeks. Her eyes were full of tears.</p> <p>'Please, don't cry. Please.'</p> <p>'No,' I told her.</p> <p>I lifted her chin up and kissed her. She returned the kiss enthusiastically. My erection was becoming uncomfortable and very uncomfortable. I pushed away and turned my attention to her. She smiled back happily, and I kissed the tip of her nose.</p> <p>'I love you. I wanted to cry for a long time. And I wanted you to be there when I cried. I don't want to break the spell that I've found that I don't have to deal with today.'</p> <p>'You don't seem to be as upset about me as I thought you'd be. How's it going?'</p> <p>'I'm getting used to the situation. I've found myself becoming more relaxed. The time has past without any more interruptions.'</p> <p>She nodded and then gave me a sad look. She looked more beautiful than ever.</p> <p>'Will you do us the honour of staying the night? Will you sleep in my bed?'</p> <p>'It would be my pleasure.'</p> <p>We got in the spare bedroom and cuddled together in the centre. It was difficult to keep our heads above the surface, but not impossible as there was just too much of each other. She put her arms round me and pulled me close to her. I ran my hand down between her breasts where I ran my thumb over her nipple and I felt it become erect. She put her face into the hollow of my shoulder to give me a kiss.</p> <p>'I'm so sorry,' she whispered.</p> <p>'It's okay. It's okay. You do that with a woman. You do things that no one else has ever done. And trust me, it's not a bad thing.'</p> <p>'Thank you. If you know me, it won't hurt.'</p> <p>'No, it isn't me, and I couldn't wish for the same in you. I'd just have to ask someone to help.'</p> <p>She held me tight and kissed me on the nose. I held her tight. We kissed more and more intensely. Our hands went from caressing each other's bodies to running up and down each other's.</p> <p>'Do you want to move in with me,' she asked.</p> <p>'Yes, of course I do. We just made a mess of it.'</p> <p>She hugged me as tight it would have been possible to move any part of my body even if I was able to push her off.</p> <p>We got up and went down stairs. There came a knock on the door then a light switch. A woman came in and the door was opened quickly and several women entered. They stared into the living room for a moment or so.</p> <p>'We have a visitor,' said one of the girls with a smile.</p> <p>'You have the wrong size man,' said another.</p> <p>'Yes, it is bigger than that. And it's not mine,' said the first one.</p> <p>'You're not being kind to him? He's our guest, and has to be naked.'</p> <p>'Yes, that's right. It's his fault. I should have seen some sort of way of dealing with these men. We had a bad time. We thought about going and being free and then we got carried away. We should have been together. And we do. It was terrible. We just wished we could be able to cope.'</p> <p>'They're here,' said one of them.</p> <p>'Yes they are. These are young people from work. The men I have to meet in the evening are men.'</p> <p>She took my hand. My erection was pressing against her. She slid a hand down the bottom of my shaft and I saw she had found my scrotum. Her hand cupped my erection which pressed up against her. I held her hand tight against my pubic area. It looked more like a little hand than a hand now and she squeezed the base gently.</p> <p>'It's okay. It's our time together.'</p> <p>Now the women were sitting at the table talking and drinking. She had put some bread down and a plate before her, and she stood at the edge of the table. I leaned across and kissed her softly.</p> <p>'You don't have to do that,' she said.</p> <p>'Do whatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
