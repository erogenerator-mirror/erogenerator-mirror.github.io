He said to me, and I got up and went inside.</p> <p>My sister and her husband had left us a couple of weeks ago and left us their home. They were all gone for six months now, leaving us alone to decide with our own thoughts what to do next.</p> <p>We had the feeling that we were going to be alone, for I don't remember what we had talked to each other about yet. I didn't care, because when I was with her, the way she looked and what she felt, I had become. "Suck me off." Was all I knew.</p> <p>Well the last thing on my mind. I heard the doorbell to the house. It rang the night before, as was expected now. It was a familiar chime from our last conversation. "That will never stop you. Oh and don't call before the show starts in a minute."</p> <p>What could I say? I was never going to talk about that night again. It was over the top, the moment just started and there were no excuses for a lifetime. There was no going back to him for the next two years. And I never would.</p> <p>I went to the door, I didn't want to open it. I waited until the doorbell rang again, but that didn't help either. I didn't think we would be able to open the door again in six months.</p> <p>I knocked but didn't see anybody. I opened the door to find it was dark outside. I walked through the door, there was a man there, standing not too close but far enough to hear my footsteps. I stopped, I couldn't move. The man looked a little younger than me. He smiled down at me. I was in my element here. The man was about six-five or so, maybe two-foot, and thin. He was obviously a lot younger than I was. I have to admit, my eyes were going right to his cock which was now bulging under his light grey trousers. This was getting really uncomfortable. I said something though, I don't think he heard right. I looked at him, I was about to say something but before I could, he said something that I didn't believe, and I felt his hand move slowly from my forehead down my neck to the top of my breasts. I felt him squeeze my breasts and then feel them harden under his touch. I looked down and he looked up and saw that my shirt was pulled up to my chin to expose my breasts. All he could do was look, he lifted his face up to look and then back to my half open mouth. I could feel his tongue sliding through my lips now and the kiss went on for some time. He pulled my shirt down to expose my tits. He cupped them and pulled on my nipples hard. He smiled and continued to look at me, his eyes locked onto my nipples, and his breathing picked up again.</p> <p>"No." I said, and he smiled as he pulled me toward him.</p> <p>"No?" He was grinning again, and now he slid his hand inside the waistband of my shorts to feel me through.</p> <p>"No." I said, but he was already inside me and with one hand I pulled myself into his cock. I could not believe it. This man was now touching me in one of the most intimate places of man and woman. This man was in my house holding me from behind, his cock rubbing against my pussy, rubbing against me, and pushing against the tip of my cervix. I was completely at his mercy now. My hands were above me in his hands. It wasn't just me. My sister was watching him. My pussy was filled with this man's fingers and I could feel it quivers in my womb. He had taken off his pants now, and he stood, holding his hand still inside me, as I felt myself becoming a part of him. He began to stroke me harder now. I had moved my legs apart now. He was right now. I was. He was moving my sex against him. He wasn't kissing me, in fact I am pretty sure he had not moved his cock inside me at all. No, he was pushing me into the bedroom. Suddenly I felt him stop and he was gone from my vagina. That is when the sound of the bedroom door opening came from, and then everything went black. I'm sorry to say that he was a little annoyed. I should say something, I know it wasn't a good idea, but I just don't have the courage to tell him. I did my best to stay quiet. It was almost six months ago. I have no idea why. All I know is it felt like five or ten days, before my whole family took a vacation, without saying anything. All that and more. A few days ago I remember the night when I was with my mother and herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
