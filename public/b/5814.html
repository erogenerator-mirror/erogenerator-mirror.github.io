I could sense her body tensing with excitement as I reached the point of no return. The sensation was intense, and I felt it build and explode. I pulled all the way out, just letting the head of my cock be enveloped in her warmth then slammed back into her. My thrust was rapid and hard, and I held myself there as her entire body jerked and flexed under me, and her moans matched with every thrust from my hips.</p> <p>We moaned together, as my cock began to convulse, then I released the deepest feeling and felt my cock pulsate again deep into her. She groaned as she felt it, and I felt her body tremble, and knew that I had finished and was going to explode inside if she hadn't held on so far. But she held me tight against her and kissed my neck as our bodies were still shaking together. I pushed down on her shoulders until her face was resting against mine. Then, I kissed her, and she responded with a groan as I slid a third finger into her. I could hear her murmuring as her body relaxed and she wrapped her arms around me.</p> <p>I slipped from her and lay next to her gently, then we sat there, holding each other as I felt her relax. She kissed my cheek as her breathing slowed. She lay back, just staring at me with the most loving eyes. My chest was heaving as the heat of our love making seeped into my own. I kissed her cheek and her lips, then kissed her neck and up to her mouth. She opened her mouth, and I slipped my tongue into it. Her tongue found mine and they joined, and it went into my mouth in a perfect mating dance. And we kissed as her lips opened for me to kiss her again.</p> <p>She pulled me down to lay next to her again, and I could feel the wetness between her legs against my leg. I slipped down and lay down on top of her and kissed her, then laid my face on her lips. She pulled me down to have her kiss me as we lay next to each other, and I could see the look of pure desire in her eyes as she kissed me. I felt her lips close around my ear and her fingers stroke my hair.</p> <p>"I want you," she whispered. "I want, but won't I be a girl when you get to know me, to know the truth about me?"</p> <p>"I promise," I managed to say, and kissed her again.</p> <p>"If we make love again, we'll never forget about you," she promised as she pulled the hair from my face.</p> <p>She rolled her mouth to mine and our lips met and caressed each other, before she rolled up and lay back on the bed. She looked at me and I could see the fire in her eyes, and said "I'm yours." And I did. I leaned over her and slipped my tongue into her as I lifted her hips up a little and slid onto my back. I could feel her hot body move beneath me, her breasts rising and falling with each groan. Her hair was tickling my chest as I kissed her. We laid still for a moment, each one in our own state of love, before she took my chin and kissed me again.</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yes," and I lay back and took her hand and brought it to my face. Then she put her hand on my cock, and I pulled it up so that she could take the head of my dick into her hand. I could feel myself as it entered her, through the folds of her inner lips. We were both breathing heavily as she slid her hand up and down slowly, and I felt the sensation of her hand gripping me, slowly caressing me, as she caressed on me her pubis hair. My hand on her leg was caressing her, but my heart was not just in the pleasure of her touch, but in the feel of her. "What are you doing to me?" I whispered quietly, as my body continued to move. "Are you sure? Is it ok to feel me?"</p> <p>"Of course," she said as she took the head of my cock in her thumb and forefinger and slowly slid the first three fingers of her other hand down inside me, and stroked me slowly. "I'm yours!"</p> <p>She pulled up a little, then took me in her mouth, and I could feel the hot saliva between our bodies.
