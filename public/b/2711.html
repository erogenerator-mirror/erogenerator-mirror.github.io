This is my last chance!" I told him. "Do you really have to kill me first?"</p> <p>"We'll need to kill you to get to the main body!" He retorted.</p> <p>"What? Why?" I asked.</p> <p>"I know why! I've been wanting to do it forever now! For a start, I can't stay here no more! I'm not going back. I'm no longer my son's mate," he told me looking at me strangely.</p> <p>"Your son's mate? Who is he, how did he get your mate, where was he? How long have you been...?" I asked trying to find the right words to use.</p> <p>"You know it!" He replied snappishly as his body shied away from me, backing away so that he could go to the bar.</p> <p>"Yes, I know it! But I don't want to be another statistic anymore!"</p> <p>I took his hand and we turned and fled from the alley. But I wasn't as fast as I thought. I had been walking for years, my body was too active at the time and I missed this. I ran, I ran, I ran! My hands were flying around and my heart was pounding so hard it scared me! I stumbled out of the alley and tripped over something I couldn't see. I was on my side, I was on my back, and I wanted to run at least, but I couldn't escape that pain. I wanted to die! What else could I loose?</p> <p>Eventually, I was able to catch my breath as I came to my feet. I looked down upon my body and saw I was completely covered in blood. In the distance, I could hear the sounds of people who were talking together. It was quiet.</p> <p>"W-w-what happened?" I asked.</p> <p>"You must be hurt," she said, as if she was concerned.</p> <p>"No! I'll kill you if you kill me! I can't be... I'm not his mate! We're nothing. I can't be... We have to die..." I said, fighting back my tears.</p> <p>"We can't! You're a Vampire! You should have taken us!" she said, as if she was offended that his mate didn't take him back.</p> <p>"I'm not a Vampire! It's not about us! It's you, and what you do!" I exclaimed, not understanding the words behind them.</p> <p>"You're still in your blood! We can't do anything!" she explained.</p> <p>"I'm still as a Vampyr, still as a Demon Vampyr! We're not being attacked by a stranger!" I demanded.</p> <p>"We're killing each other," she said.</p> <p>"You have to kill me!" I screamed. "Why? Why can't you kill me? Why are you trying to kill me?" I demanded.</p> <p>"I can't tell you! I'm not his mate! He doesn't... I wouldn't tell you he's still a Vampire! I'll kill you! It's not you!" I demanded, not understanding it all.</p> <p>"Who is this female creature? You must kill her!" I wanted to cry as my blood ran cold. "What... She's my mate, that's impossible!" I said, pointing one finger at her. "This female creature is my daughter!" I screamed. "Please kill me, this is my only chance!" I begged.</p> <p>"I'm not killing you," she said, not stopping her gaze down at me. "Now, you'll need to be able to get out of this alley."</p> <p>"No! I said! I'll kill you." I demanded.</p> <p>"You're not going to kill you. I'm not an animal. You can't live until you die!" she said, still not giving me the chance to talk.</p> <p>"You don't feel too strongly about killing me, do you?" I said, still with my hands clasped in front of me.</p> <p>"We can't make it this way!" she said. "If you stay alive, we'll kill you! We'll be very sorry to do so to you, but we will kill you if you stay alive!" she exclaimed, as if she wanted to tell me something. "We want you alive, not dead."</p> <p>"No," I argued. "This is madness! You can't kill me!"</p> <p>"Yes we can! We'll kill you. You see, we can't go back!" she asserted. She was being too forceful in her tone.</p> <p>"But you killed him!" I exclaimed, still holding on to her handsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
