She smiled at me and pulled the door open wider for the two of us, letting in more light. Both of us smiled.</p> <p>"Thanks," she said. "It was nice to meet you." Her voice, again, was very low and seductive, "I mean, if you haven't noticed, I'm not a professional. I'm just a lady coming over here to see some friends."</p> <p>"Oh, so you've decided to hang out with us?" I asked nervously. "But, you won't be seeing any of us, will you?"</p> <p>"I know I will," she replied, "but, we're really really a tight knit group here. We have our own little townhouse upstairs and I've brought a friend a few nights ago. She wanted to be sure we could get together on occasion for a little, um, fun."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sorry!"</p> <p>She nodded toward another door to the right. "If you want to go upstairs and catch up with friends, you don't need to go through that door."</p> <p>"But, but, but. That's really none of your business." There was a strange sense of uneasiness there, though, as all along, she was being very kind and solicitous to keep me company.</p> <p>"It's no business of your business what you are doing upstairs and why you are being so kind to me," she said. "We're just going to have some fun." I thought I detected a little hesitation in her voice and the fact that she didn't seem to be holding back more than she had. Either one would be just fine, I thought.</p> <p>I followed her up the stairs and into the second floor, where the bedrooms were on one side, the master suite on the other. We entered the door to the door on the right and there was only one door on the left. There was no sign of anyone else in the kitchen.</p> <p>"If you two can stay, I'd love to have some cocktails, and maybe get me something to eat," she said before we both had time to say anything else. She led me to the kitchen counter, where a pitcher and saucer and two wine glasses sat, the kind that I saw on the refrigerator for the past month. I'd never really been a drinker before, but the drinks made me forget them like they were a drug.</p> <p>She took a drink, a half-glass, and set it on the counter next to the glass. She offered me her hand and I followed her as she pulled away from me. We walked quickly around the counter and went to the bar. I was on my third drink of the evening and decided to finish it. After another sip, I pulled out the second glass, filled it again, and set it on the bar to my left.</p> <p>"Thanks, but, it's just a little too early for a celebration." I pulled the empty glass away. I hadn't been drinking very heavily since the first time I'd had a couple of more cocktails. She smiled at me and took the glass from my hand. "No need to hurry. I can pour another glass of wine for you." She turned her back to me and reached behind and with her fingers, unzipped the neckline of the bikini top. She let the top drop to the floor. The top, I noticed, was even more transparent than the bikini. The material showed that she wore nothing beneath the top.</p> <p>The material had an inch-thick edge that went far beyond her breasts. I could see her nipple standing on its tip. I drank in the sight. It looked so pretty to me and I couldn't wait to see it. I raised my glass and offered it. She turned her back toward me again and as she moved toward me, she pulled her bikini bottom down, freeing her right hip and her swollen pussy lips. I sat the glass away, raised the glass and raised mine, giving one of her nipples a tweak. She took the glass and set it down on the bar in front of one of the large iron bar stools at the opposite end of the bar. Her hip was now in plain view. It looked even sexier than I had imagined that it would.</p> <p>"You've got one hell of an ass, I would like to stick my tongue up your ass," she said, reaching out with her one hand to take a couple of her fingers, tracing a line from my shoulder down to my waist. We stared at each other as she opened her mouth and slipped three of her fingers into her mouth. A drop of moisture formed in her opening, as she sucked her juice off her fingers. "A good taste, maybe some of the stuff you ate last night.
