I'm sure it would be nice for you to go in and use him."</p> <p>I'm not sure where that comment came from, but I am not going to try to put it in words. I was still wearing my boxers when he got dressed. As he walked past me, I caught his hand in mine. I smiled and he left.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>I can't tell you how many thoughts ran through my head. I was nervous, like I couldn't find any one. Finally after an hour, I had decided it was time to take some time to think of something. I went to my own apartment and packed a change of clothes and a bag. I decided to go back to the college, which meant changing for my ride from the curb in the car. As we drove by, a few of the guys in the dorm kept making comments at me, including the one guy named Steve. I didn't like being the center of attention even more. We stopped in front of the dorm and I got out of the car. He took my money and we went inside. It was dark, it was cold, but it felt cool. The air conditioning was working fine.</p> <p>I told them that he was looking for someone to get him some ice, and I made him strip. I made him stand with one hand over him. I lifted his legs and pushed in. I pulled his shirt over his head and started to rub his dick while I played with him. I started to suck, and he made little moans of enjoyment. I licked the back of his neck, and down to his chest. I sucked on his nipple and he grabbed the back of my neck tighter for support. I moved on to his dick and stroked his length. He was breathing so hard and moaning in my ear.</p> <p>After about five minutes he told me he wanted to fuck me. I was scared that he wasn't going to come. I don't think I could handle that. He grabbed my hand and held on, and I put it where I needed it. He lifted my shirt onto my head, and I didn't even have the shirt on. He rubbed my shoulders for just a minute before he put his full lips on me. It was intense and the first guy in the back seat. He was about fifteen. He pulled away from me. I didn't know if my heart was beating faster there or my dick was even harder.</p> <p>He put his hands on my shoulders and kissed his way down my chest. I let him do it for about five minutes until I felt his dick on my pussy. I was so wet. He pushed in again, and after a few seconds his dick was inside of me. I had been turned on more than ever and I had to have that monster inside me. I lifted my leg and put it over his, as he pushed in again. I put my legs high, to give him even better penetration as I wrapped my legs around his waist. He held on to me like he was holding on to bread. I had never felt anything this good.</p> <p>He started to go faster and faster as soon as he was in me. The only sound I heard was the noise of our bodies slapping together. My breath started to come out in ragged pants. I was close. I had never felt such an intense orgasm. I had never felt so turned on. As he hit this spot, I had to grab on to the back of the truck to keep from falling into his lap. He was pumping in and out of me without pause. With one final push I felt the warm spurts of hot cum explode inside me. He collapsed next to me on the seat behind us as I was still shaking. As I calmed down my eyes were closed and I knew it was only a matter of time to take my chances of getting caughtâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
