Her fingers worked it like it was a piece of silk and she stroked its swollen, rock hard shaft, causing it to stiffen.</p> <p>"Oh...this is going to be one hell of an enjoyable flight!...oh God...this is so...amazing...I mean...I just want to go home!"</p> <p>I wanted it to be as much of a surprise as possible for her when she got home. I took off my suit coat, and hung it on her bedroom door. Then, I took my shoes off and slipped my dress slacks off before walking to my tuxedo.</p> <p>When she walked into the living room, I closed the door, turned on the TV and sat down to wait for her. She sat down on the sofa across from me, and leaned against a far end.</p> <p>"I have to tell you, Tony is a remarkable man, and I really love him, and we both love being together. He's very respectful and kind and sweet to me. I have no desire to hurt you like that! You're quite the lucky woman, if you could look at me that way."</p> <p>As she spoke, she leaned forward, reached behind her back, untied her bow, and pulled it out from under her dress. It dropped to her ankles. "My turn, now!" and she unbuttoned the dress.</p> <p>Her hands moved up to rub my shoulders and chest as she undid the buttons holding my shirt open. As she lowered the front of it, it pulled open the front of her bra.</p> <p>"Here, let me help you," she teased. She reached back, unhooked her bra, and let it fall to the floor. She leaned back against the sofa cushions, then spread her legs.</p> <p>I watched, watching her legs as they spread, inviting her to touch herself. As her fingers glided down her breasts, the straps of her bra slipped down her arms and fell to the floor. She leaned up slightly, and took her hands and hands from her breasts and rubbed them on her nipples, tugging and rubbing them while she took her hands from her breasts and brought them back up to her mouth, kissing her nipples with her tongue. She rolled her lips around them, sucking them and pulling on them with her lips. Her breasts bounced as she rolled her nipple between her thumb and forefinger, making loud pop as it popped out. She slid her fingers back into her panties, teasing her clit before she slid two of them into her pussy. She began slowly inching them in and out, and soon was moaning in pleasure as she finger-fucked herself while rubbing her clit against her fingers.</p> <p>I watched her as she brought two beautiful breasts to her mouth and rubbed them against her own nipples. I was in shock as she sucked each of them to life.</p> <p>"God!...so good. So hot," she said, her eyes closed.</p> <p>"I want to see you come...," I said. "I want to see you come."</p> <p>She smiled and put the breasts back where they belonged, spreading her legs as she moved to lay on the couch. She looked so wonderful, her brown hair fell over her shoulder, across her breasts and over her belly. She ran one finger through it, as if trying to make it as long as she could.</p> <p>"Let me know if you want me to come...," she whispered.</p> <p>I moved down to her, moving up her body until my face was near her pussy. She let go with a sigh, and pulled away from me as I slowly began to lick her there, stopping to suckle each nipple as I flicked back and forth. She let out a soft moan, and spread her lips for me, then lowered her legs and allowed me to continue to tease her.</p> <p>When she began to get quiet. "Please, Tony, please don't stop," was all she could manage to utter between moans.</p> <p>I moved back to her pussy and found her clit. I moved my tongue to it gently as softly as I could, and began to rub it as I flicked her now hardening clit.</p> <p>"Oh God," she screamed. "Do it. Oh, Tony, please do it."</p> <p>I continued. She grabbed my head and pulled me in and pushed me in deeper. I moved back, and brought her closer. Her body began to shake in orgasm as I began to suck and nibble her clit again. As with before, she seemed to want to come, and began to moan and scream.</p> <p>"Oh...oh...don't stop...you can take it...oh God, let it go for a second," she continued to beg. "Oh yes...please..."</p> <p>Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
