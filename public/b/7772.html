Even though she wanted it to stay that way, that he was teasing her, teasing her body with his cock, it was still hard to tell if her body accepted what was happening. Her body was starting to ache with need. He just looked up at her and smiled. He grabbed the back of her head, and pulled her against him, as he started moving his hands over her body, running his hands over and around her breasts, rubbing her through the thin fabric of her shirt, feeling her nipples against his palms. He pulled her shirt off, and looked at her stomach as he slid his hand up to her breasts, feeling her hardening nipple pressing against his palm as he cupped one breast, feeling her nipple growing in his hand.

She knew he was too big to fit in there tonight. He started to go to her, sliding his fingers into her as he kissed her neck again. He slid his hand under her and started to rub her clit, stroking her from base to tip, sliding a finger from the heel of his palm to the other side, making her moan as he touched her. She reached over and grabbed his cock, and started to rub his dick in her hand, trying to get some friction against his head while rubbing him, feeling him through his jeans. She stopped him.</p> <p>"Let me get dressed for a few minutes." His head snapped to hers. "You still think you're going to be back inside tonight." She leaned up and kissed him on the cheek as she pulled the shirt over her head. "I love you, sweetie."</p> <p>"I love youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
