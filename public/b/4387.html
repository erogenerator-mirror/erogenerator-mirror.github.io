I moved down to her breasts. My cock felt so hard, pulsing through my pants. I could feel her nipples hardening. I could feel her soft breast through the material of her shirt. I rubbed my cock through my shorts.</p> <p>I leaned over her, kissing her nipples, flicking the tip of my tongue around and into the mouth of her left nipple. Karen arched her back and moaned. I kissed, then sucked, then bit her nipple gently. She held me tight, moaning and moaning.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, I like that."</p> <p>I kissed my way down, my hand reaching up to feel Karen's breasts under her shirt. I kissed her neck, my tongue snaking out to taste the soft flesh of her skin, her scent, the way she moaned.</p> <p>I felt hands on my pants. Karen was getting braver. I didn't want that, but I did anyway.</p> <p>I unsnapped her bra and it slid off. Karen turned to look at me. She pulled my shirt over my head.</p> <p>"I want you naked," she whispered.</p> <p>"I love you," I murmured, as we kissed again.</p> <p>Karen took my nipple between her thumb and forefinger and pulled gently. I felt her other hand slip underneath my boxer shorts, reaching for my cock. A finger wrapped around the base, then back up to gently tug on the tip, lifting it to make me squirm. Karen sucked it softly, then squeezed it gently.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she murmured. "I love you too."</p> <p>I slipped one hand under her sweatshirt to fondle her bare breast and she responded by pulling the fabric further up her body.</p> <p>I slid the panties over her hips and she lowered them to the ground. The panties fell to the ground behind us and I grabbed the waistband to tug them off. Karen lifted her hips, spreading her legs. I pushed her sweats down as she spread her legs widely again.</p> <p>I slid onto my side and positioned myself between her legs, lying on top of her. She lifted her knees to my shoulders and reached out her arms to rest them on my chest and to hug me.</p> <p>"Wow," she said when I slid my hips down and entered her.</p> <p>"What?" I asked, "Didn't you feel good?"</p> <p>"That was incredible, but I think we can finish up here."</p> <p>"Do we do?"</p> <p>"Yeah. But hurry it up quick to get it inside me."</p> <p>I slipped my hips around, trying not to put too much weight on her.</p> <p>I began a slow pace. I reached out and kissed the tip of her nose. Karen took it in her mouth and sucked. I pushed deeper into her with each stroke. It felt so good, just the way I liked it.</p> <p>"Jesus," she said while pulling her lips away from my cock.</p> <p>I could see in her eyes how much she loved my cock inside her.</p> <p>"Does it hurt?"</p> <p>"Just a little," she answered.</p> <p>I pushed in deeper with each stroke. I didn't know how much I could drive her to it. Karen's vagina was wet, so I felt the walls of her vagina slide all the way to the base of my shaft. I looked down and my penis was sliding up and down. I loved feeling it up against her.</p> <p>"Oh, Mike," she cried. "It feels so good, in you. Like.... It's so good, I'm gonna cum, soon."</p> <p>I could feel her pussy squeezing my cock in a way just like a pussy.</p> <p>"Yes, cum now, my darling."</p> <p>Karen began moaning again. She started thrusting her hips back against me in a series of small circles. I felt her orgasm as I felt the one wave of her love wash through her. I could feel my own orgasm growing, but I wanted to fuck her some more. "I want to feel it inside me, Mike."</p> <p>"Just for a moment," I responded. "Let it hit. I'll hold out."</p> <p>Karen opened her eyes. "Mike, I want you, too."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I asked. "I mean..."</p> <p>I thrust harder, feeling her lips wrap around mine. Our tongues danced in a mutual frenzy. We kissed each other deeply. My cock was throbbing harder and hotter against her pussy. Her breasts pressed my chest, and we fucked.</p> <p>One of her legs was still around mine, but I didn't press my penis into her as deep as I could. I lifted my hips, feeling her muscles tighten, feeling my pubic hair on her soft mound. Karen's hips raised to meet me. I thrust faster and harder, wantingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
