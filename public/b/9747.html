He sighed.</p> <p>"Do you want to watch me touch myself?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm all wet."</p> <p>"You must mean you want to rub some of your cock." I said, pushing my fingers into my panties until they were soaked through.</p> <p>"I have to, no, I mean just, I want to lick you first..." He said, slowly, tentatively.</p> <p>"I need to, you mean lick your tongue... then put it in you..." I said, pulling his hand away from me and moving it to my hip.</p> <p>"Just put it in me..." He mumbled. I moved his hand away from my hip and put it on my shoulder. I slowly rubbed my neck and back with the back of his hand. He groaned in my ear, and I felt his cock jump under his boxers. I turned and smiled. I turned back and lay down on the couch, turning onto my side.</p> <p>"Put it in me so hard I can feel it throb, I have to sit up." I whispered to him. He did and I could feel his warm hardness against my ass cheek. I spread my legs, and he placed the head of his dick against my lips.</p> <p>"I have to, I think I should touch myself too. Touch your nipple as I stroke my cock. It needs all of that stimulation right now. Just put your dick in my mouth." I said, opening my mouth up, running the head from my mouth to the end of him and back.</p> <p>"I want so much to, I need to feel you. I am so wet, there is nothing that I have wanted since this morning." He said as he slowly put the head of his cock past my lips.</p> <p>"Hm, and there is plenty of it right now..." I said, running my tongue around it. He held his breath as I started bobbing my mouth up and down on him, running my tongue on the base and back up the head, then letting it slide on back down. He grabbed me by the back of my head and pushed his cock further into my mouth. As soon as he did, I felt him jerk a little, and a warm spurt shot into my mouth.</p> <p>"Oh! Oh!" he said, and I could feel him twitch a little again.</p> <p>"You taste so good." I said, smiling.</p> <p>He smiled back, stroking my hair. "I like watching you." He said. I giggled. I wasn't sure if I did, but I couldn't stop staring at his cock, and it was getting hard again. He put his hand at the back of my head again. I knew what he wanted.</p> <p>"I feel so good... I can't stop..." I said, stroking him faster and faster. I rubbed my cock again and he moved his hand back to my hip, to hold onto it. He moved his hips forward and I felt his cock go deep into my mouth and I could feel it throb with the motion of his hand. I could feel myself getting hot again. I moaned a little, and then I pulled him in for another thrust. He held my head for a second to help me, then pushed forward again and held my head again. He slid further in and I felt his head bump my throat. I sucked on him, and he bucked his hips against me.</p> <p>"Ah, oohh..." He said loudly, his dick coming out of the back of my mouth with a squish as the head touched the back of my throat. His cum seemed to flow out of him, and I gagged for a moment. He pushed it back in again as I sucked on him. We were both breathing a little hard, trying to catch our breaths. He grabbed my head slightly and pushed himself farther into my mouth. I could feel his head at the opening of my throat. He held my head steady for a second, then pulled my face down over him.</p> <p>"Ahh! Ah! Ah! Ohhhh", was all I could say. I could taste my own cum on his cock, and it tasted just like my own salty taste. As I sucked on him, I could feel his fingers tighten up on my hair and push hard.</p> <p>"It feels so good, don't stop." He said. He grabbed my hair and pulled my head hard into him as I sucked on him. His cum kept coming in thick spurts from the tip of his cock. It seemed endless until he stopped again, but before it was finished he pulled me off. Before his cum could drip from my mouth into mine, I did too and opened my mouth to let him put the head of his cock in. He held my head as he pushed himself into me.</p> <p>"Yesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
