She had missed lunch.</p> <p>"We don't have lunch until you come back to school on Monday," Bill, her dad said cheerfully. "You know how it is."</p> <p>"But don't I have to go back?"</p> <p>"Yes, you do," Bill said firmly, but he seemed more interested in what was on the menu. He pulled out a chair out for Amy to sit on and handed her a glass of water. "To us," he said, "till you're back to class...and for us!"</p> <p>She drank deeply of her tea.</p> <p>"Here. I have to go to the bathroom."</p> <p>Amy got up quickly.</p> <p>"I'll go get breakfast."</p> <p>"Can I have one too," Bill said and grinned, "or does my dad want a glass of his dad's favorite?"</p> <p>"Of course!" Amy said, and they shared a playful smile.</p> <p>"Now I want to go and get ready," Bill said. "Come sit and do your part."</p> <p>Amy quickly walked back to the living room, a note in her purse lying on the coffee table. Beside it was a note that stated "Come make yourself comfortable." She didn't doubt it for a second.</p> <p>Bill was sitting on the sofa, reading an article on sports. He smiled wryly at the magazine. It was a little sports reference.</p> <p>"You're such a darling," he praised. "I'll come get you then."</p> <p>Amy took the water from the bathroom glass.</p> <p>"I have to tell you, it was really a surprise."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"You saw my surprise?"</p> <p>"No. I didn't. You did. You got up to go to class and I didn't."</p> <p>Amy hesitated before continuing, "Well, I didn't have any homework to do."</p> <p>"Good."</p> <p>"But I guess there was a little bit of my skirt showing, in addition to my blouse."</p> <p>"Is that all?"</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Then you must think it's a waste of a good thing," Bill offered.</p> <p>He laughed. Amy raised her eyebrows, obviously confused.</p> <p>"It's not a waste," he said, holding his arms out in a mock gesture.</p> <p>Amy gave him a puzzled look, but her face warmed quickly to the smile that remained on her face. She took the glass of water and set it in front him. Slowly, she brought it to her lips and swirled it around in the water. The cool splashes on her lips, back to her mouth, and cheeks seemed to be sending chills all over her body.</p> <p>"I think you missed breakfast, but I think I'll make my mom breakfast," Bill said.</p> <p>Amy took the opportunity to step up the ladder toward the bedroom. Bill pulled his own shirt off. He unzipped his belt and the jeans were the next to go. Bill turned his back toward her as she stepped up behind him, slipping the jeans and panties down his legs, and then he stepped out of them. Amy took some small pieces of paper from her purse.</p> <p>"Here's how I want you to eat breakfast this morning. After you get yourself cleaned up and get back to class, that is. You come back to school, and you'll have your homework graded, and I'll have mine graded," Amy read out loud.</p> <p>"Really?" Bill said, looking back behind his mother.</p> <p>"Yes," Amy said. "And I think it might be fun to help her with her homework," she said.</p> <p>The idea that she could be helping her friend in school to grade some homework came to her mind.</p> <p>"What is it?" Amy asked, confused by what he had said.</p> <p>"I was wondering if I could help. You and Bill are the two of you. You are both helping Amy," Bill said.</p> <p>Amy had no idea what to say. She was sure that her dad had a fetish for panties. It's not that he loved them—too much of a problem—but he wasn't sure if he could help her. But what was she thinking?</p> <p>"Sure," Amy said, not at all sure what to do with the time.</p> <p>"Why don't you start with me and we'll see what happens," Bill said as he put his hands on Amy's shoulders.</p> <p>Amy took Bill's hands, which were now at the sides of her breasts. She looked into his eyes and kissed him. It was a very soft, but forceful kiss. It was only a brief moment of contact.</p> <p>"Do you mean to say," Amy pressed closer, "that I'm making an arrangement between you and Bill for lunch or something—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
