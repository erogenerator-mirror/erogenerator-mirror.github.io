She held him lightly, and he knew she had made love with a long time ago. His cock surged as she stroked him with long firm strokes, until his cock jumped and twitched with the excitement of her soft hand, and the desire that seeped in to her loins.</p> <p>She knelt before him, her hands holding his thighs lightly, her lips kissing the underside of his erection, her head turning toward his legs.</p> <p>She lowered her tongue, licking his balls and then up the shaft to the tip of his cock. She licked him slowly and deeply, his body shuddered, and he groaned deeply in pleasure, the first release to come filling her mouth.</p> <p>Once it was done, his eyes snapped open to see her hovering over him, a gleam on her eyes that made his mouth water. "My God!" he thought, and ran his hands through her short short hair, gently stroking her head. "You are a natural!" he thought. He was in ecstasy.</p> <p>She took him in her mouth again and let him enter her warm little mouth for a moment, letting him feel his shaft touch the softness of her throat. She sucked gently on him, the movement of the head brushing his inner scrotum causing his body to jerk with an intense pressure.</p> <p>His hands caressed her hair, loving the feeling of it brushing his skin between his fingers. He knew she was watching him, he could feel her breath on his cock.</p> <p>Her lips went slowly up the length of his shaft, making him writhe and groan with desire, until their lips met, and he felt his body arch with desire, his hands finding her head.</p> <p>She took him as slowly as she might, and with each stroke she drew him up into her mouth. Her tongue began to dance around his head as she descended, taking him deep inside her hungry mouth.</p> <p>He felt her tongue caressing the underside of the shaft as it slipped into her lips, and it didn't take long to send him high. He grabbed her head, his hands holding her head firmly. His cock throbbed and throbbed, each time her tongue slid over him, and he felt the first spurt of his sperm run out of him.</p> <p>He was exhausted, spent, and he was in ecstasy.</p> <p>She fell onto him, his legs hanging off the side of his body with the weight of her. She raised her face from his cock, her eyes shining with passion and desire. Her eyes were full of love and passion, and she was hungry for more.</p> <p>His cock twitched once more, and she lifted her body, her pussy still hovering over his eyes, "Let's rest," she said softly.</p> <p>He lifted his face up, feeling her wet, hairy pussy press on his lips. He felt his own passion, and then her soft, hot lips pressed against his, and he sucked her lips tenderly, her kisses sending his head spinning with pleasure. He kissed her, feeling her soft breasts pressed against him, and his cock jerked involuntarily as she pulled away, taking it out of him.</p> <p>"God, I've wanted to that for months," she said, sitting up on the side of the bed. He sat up, pulling her gently toward him, kissing her hard and passionately. She pushed him back onto the bed, straddling him, her hands running up and down his chest, her fingers rubbing his nipples gently.</p> <p>"Do you want me?" she asked, her voice a throaty whisper.</p> <p>He could barely speak, he had never wanted anyone as bad as he wanted her once again.</p> <p>"Yes!" he gasped out, and her eyes closed with love. He cupped her face in his hands, his fingers playing with her hair.</p> <p>"Let me!" she whispered, placing his hands on her hips to steady her, and taking him with a tight, impassioned kiss.</p> <p>He felt her legs wrap around him, her body moving against him, and they held each other tightly. He felt her hands on his chest, as they began to move slowly up to his shoulders, her feet caressing his legs.</p> <p>He lifted her and her slid her down to lie on the bed as he moved beside her. She opened her legs, waiting obediently for him.</p> <p>He moved atop her, her body feeling him, and he began to kiss her, his hands caressing her back as her breasts were pushed gently against his chest. He felt her hands on his shoulders, her breasts rising and falling as he felt her breasts being pushed between their chests.</p> <p>His hands left her, moving quickly down her body, taking his time as he felt his fingers teasing her body, tracing her navel, down her thighs.</p> <p>Then he took hold of herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
