It's like something out of a movie."</p> <p>"No it isn't. We can talk at length about the weather and stuff and maybe get to know all of us."</p> <p>"I like being with both you and Sarah. I think we really got along."</p> <p>"I'm glad we all got along."</p> <p>"Me with Jon and you with him."</p> <p>"How does it feel to have a little relationship between us if not with Mike and me?"</p> <p>"I think it does. Now just think about it. Do you know how to feel about Mike and me going off with each of you two if we decide that it would be better if Mike took you off the hook?"</p> <p>Mike was listening intently as he thought of what was in store for them after the conversation with Sarah. "I think that Sarah should know that it will get harder for me if you two get to know each other better," he said softly.</p> <p>"I have a solution," Sarah said as she picked up a small box from the drawer by the bed. "Jenny told me what it is and why Mike would need a condom, so I figured it was safe."</p> <p>"Thanks Jen, you are very wise."</p> <p>She gave him a quick kiss on the cheek and went to help Jon. She got on the bed and spread out the box on the floor before sitting down between Mike's legs. He reached for her as she sat back against the pillows. Mike spread his legs as Mike reached between them for the condom. As Mike slipped it on it, he held Sarah's hand in the small of her back and looked over at Jon.</p> <p>"Here. Take this. Then do him as you saw Sarah do."</p> <p>"You know Sarah loves cock," Jon said as he picked the condom up off the floor and held it to Sarah's face. "Come on, let's try it."</p> <p>Jon lifted the end and slowly inserted the condom. "It's so cold," he said as he turned to face Jon. "Let me know if it's necessary for both of us"</p> <p>Mike and Sarah watched as Jon quickly replaced the condom on his rock hard cock. Jon then placed the end of the condom on the tip of Mike's cock.</p> <p>"We're going to try it, but I think Mike's going to cum first," Mike said as he got to his knees in front of Sarah.</p> <p>Sarah stood up in front of Sarah. Her eyes were closed and she seemed to be in euphoria. Jon looked back at Mike and smiled. Mike then placed a condom on top of an empty condom on.</p> <p>"I need to help Sarah with something," Jon said as he sat down on the edge of the bed. Mike got up between Mike's spread legs.</p> <p>"That feels so good," Sarah said. "Can I touch Jon? You ready?" Jon pulled at her hand. "Let me do it" Sarah begged.</p> <p>"Well, OK" Jon answered as he positioned the tip of the condom over the tip of Mike's cock. It took him a few second before he had the condom opened enough to place the tip of Mike's cock in between Sarah's lips. Sarah began to run her tongue down the side of Mike's cock. When she felt the head of the condom against the tip of her tongue she reached her hand down to his cock. She gripped the outside of the condom with her fingers and started to lower it. It took a short moment to go over the tip of Mike's cock.</p> <p>"Don't put it in yet. Mike's going to cum," Jon said to Mike as his cock was pulled from Sarah's mouth."</p> <p>"No, it's OK" Mike said. "I don't mind," he agreed.</p> <p>Mike slowly slid the tip of his cock up to the head of Sarah's tongue and slid it down the side of Mike's cock. When Sarah's tongue touched Mike's cock Sarah almost came. She then wrapped her lips around Mike's cock and started to bob her head up and down Mike's cock with Jon's help. Jon had a little help of his own from the other side of the bed and helped Jon slide his cock up and down Sarah's tongue. Once Jon got his cock in position, he took the head, a small amount of material and slid it down over Mike's lips.</p> <p>"OK. Now put the head of your cock in."</p> <p>Jon positioned the swollen tip at the entrance to Sarah's pussy. As Sarah's lips came together, Jon quickly pulled it back towards him. Sarah's eyes shot open as the swollen head of Mike's cock pushed inside her. Once Jon had it all the way in, he lowered himself on Sarah so that his balls were slapping against Sarah onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
