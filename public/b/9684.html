I've been so horny, haven't I?"</p> <p>My cock still hard as a rock, and as she moved her hands round to my back, she pulled me closer to her. She kissed me, deeply; slowly, softly, gently, our tongues meeting as they danced, the taste of her mouth, her scent, her musk still on my lips.</p> <p>"We're going to go slowly, my precious boy?" she grinned, and she eased herself back onto the edge of the table. She leaned backwards, as I looked up into her eyes; my heart pounding. I moved towards her, my cock standing proudly, rigid and hard. As I neared her, she turned to look down the front of her blouse, and said again, "Go ahead, my boy, get to it, you know you want to."</p> <p>Her hand reached out and slowly gripped the end of my cock, running her fingers up it.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck, yeah!" I groaned, as her hand closed on my rigid stem. She stroked it a few times, letting me feel the size, the heat of it, before sliding the top of her hand back down, to repeat the motion. We kissed, our tongues entwined as she continued to stroke me. Then she turned me round, and pushed me back onto the table. Again she lifted herself, this time sitting down on it facing me. I could feel her wetness all over, her outer lips gripping me, her nipples hard and rigid. She bent her knees, and moved her pussy right into my groin, pressing my knob against her lips. Her hands reached for my chest, and she began to ride me, letting out a soft gasp when it hit her clit. She lifted herself, as she lifted herself up, her full weight, her full body, crashing down onto mine. She let out a little squeal as I hit a spot that only she could do; my cock slid almost completely inside her.</p> <p>"Come in me, Tommy, come in me! Fuck me - I want you in me!" she moaned, "I want my lover to give me this big cock!"</p> <p>She began to move her hips faster, lifting herself up and down the length of me - my cock. My whole body shook with tremors of pleasure, the pleasure of feeling the taut muscle of her pussy gripping me, the feeling of her wet heat encircling me, squeezing me, pulsing around my cock. She held herself steady as my cock began to spasm inside her, the feeling of her hot wetness, the sound of her juices. I could feel her vagina gripping and squeezing me, I could feel her wetness as the inside of her pussy seemed to squeeze and stroke me, she started to buck and rock on my cock as the spasms started in my balls. She reached up and gripped my shoulders with her hands, as she continued to ride me, her breath ragged and ragged as she felt me pulsing as well.</p> <p>With one final gasp, she leaned back, exhausted on me, her tits heaving, her lips swollen, and her eyes closed as she concentrated on what she was feeling. I felt the cum boiling in my balls. I knew that after all this was happening to me, I wouldn't last long, and I didn't want to yet.</p> <p>Slowly, she climbed off me, and as she leaned over me, she took my cock with her mouth, lapping up the last of it, her tongue swirling round the end, sending sensations through the length of my body. She smiled, and kissed the tip of my nose, and I kissed her, sharing the taste of myself on hers. Slowly, she came up, licking my lips, her eyes, and her hair.</p> <p>"You have a nice cock, Tommy," she grinned as she leant over, "Will mine and that young friend's ever get as long as they want?" She paused a moment, and looked me in the eye, "You can tell him if he wants to fuck meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
