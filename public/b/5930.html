She knew that she was exposed to the coldest weather in the country. A large gold cross hung from its neck, as did a second one hung on the stone above the door. It was the sign of her service to the church! A symbol of their devotion and devotion to their faith. In her small hands she held the cross, the blood-red silk dress she was wearing, a gift from her Father. She wore it so innocently, she had forgotten that it was there. Only now did she understand it. The cross had a golden heart etched into it, and she knew it belonged to her Father. She took it from the alter; the cross was part of her church. "I am now a priest of the Church, the church you have consecrated to me!" she cried. It was a sign that she was no longer the Sister of The Order.</p> <p>The priest was a man with dark brown hair and green eyes, a smile upon his lips. He was tall for a priest, with tanned skin, a pair of blue eyes; and a trim body that would have a hard time keeping up with the demands and dangers of his day work. He carried a leather bag on his shoulder.</p> <p>"May I enter, Father?" she asked, not sure how he would answer that question.</p> <p>A dark laugh filled the room, as he nodded his head and opened the door. The priest took a small stool before her. He approached her, as she raised her left hand and gently rubbed the cross. "It is your mission to be married to me, my dear Sister... to worship me," he said, and then added in his gravelly voice as he gently took her hand. "My daughter, her sister, my wife. You have served me faithfully."</p> <p>Natalie lifted her hand and placed it on his cheek, then looked up into his face with a smile, "I will, Father. I will. I pray to our Lord that I may serve my country as a Priest!"</p> <p>"You have performed well in your service to me..." he replied, lifting her chin with his hand "to serve me by being willing my children!" He stepped back as he reached out for her right hand, and removed it from the cross. "To me!" he commanded. Turning her chair, his hand reached out to her and gently caressed her arm, as he gently put her hand behind his back. "My bride. My bride, my new bride!" He pulled her arms into his.</p> <p>Instantly she pulled back and looked at him, as she felt the collar of her dress being pulled tight, and the collar being unzipped. She felt the rough silk press into her skin, as his fingers gently drew a nail down her throat. She looked at him as he stood before her, eyes still lowered, with his dark hair falling down his shoulders. He was a gorgeous man, her Father, her Father...and there, on this very alter, she wanted him to touch...to kiss... to possess... and she wanted him to...to fuck her! But, he knew exactly what she wanted, she wanted him to do to her as his Father had done. His eyes had a gleam in their eyes as he took his place at her knees, and slowly slipped his right hand from her neck into her hair, and gently placed her head back. He bent his head down and kissed the top of her head, the tip of his tongue teasing her skin. His lips pressed softly against her, and his hand gently held her down as he slowly lowered himself to his knees in front of her.</p> <p>He slowly leaned forward and kissed the top of her head, gently kissing the nape of her neck, and then continued downward until he was sitting on the chair facing her. He looked up at Natalie, as his hand slowly pulled the buttons of her dress from her shoulders, down her back, to her thighs, and then along one thigh then the other, pausing at the edge of the skirt she was wearing before continuing on to her thighs. As he watched, his hands slowly worked their way slowly back up to cup the soft, smooth globes of her ass, and then slowly he kneaded the globes as he softly kissed the nape of her neck.</p> <p>She moaned softly, and slowly her hands began to run up the insides of his thighs. He slowly removed his hand from her head and let it slide down the smooth material of her dress. Natalie moaned when his hand felt the firm muscles of her ass cheek. He smiled as he kissed the bare skin just below her shoulder, before sliding his hand down her back and under her skirt. Her legs parted as he slid his hand up her back and over her dress, to find that she wore no panties. He was surprised to find that she did not wear any; in fact, there was aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
