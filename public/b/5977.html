"I can do it, just with my eyes."</p> <p>"Hey, no, no, you're no where, and you know it. But right now..." she said as she slid her hands over his shoulders. She leaned over and slid her lips against his, kissing him. The kiss was soft, so gentle and gentle that it melted both of them.</p> <p>"Do you really want me to?" he said, his lips still slightly parted.</p> <p>She nodded. "You have to promise to be honest for your first time," she said with a smile. "What if it's like that first time we did it, like I said?"</p> <p>Brad laughed nervously, "You're kidding right?"</p> <p>"Nope," she said with a warm smile. "You'll have to promise to be honest because you need me. That's what makes this so special."</p> <p>"That's sweet," he said as he pulled her into his arms. His lips met hers and they were the kind where it is you never break off, they just stay put, waiting for the next to come.</p> <p>Their mouths remained pressed together as their hands roamed over each other's body, exploring, stroking, squeezing, caressing. Their tongues battled with one another in their mouth, finding the places the other had left off. He felt her breasts press against his chest as her hands explored his back. His hands moved back to her shoulders, slipping under her shirt and caressing her skin. In the dim light from the firelight Brad realized her bra was gone. He caressed lightly over it with one hand while his other hand found the top button of her shirt. He unfastened it, feeling the soft skin of her shoulders, running his hands over them before slipping under the fabric, feeling the satiny softness of her skin.</p> <p>She let out a soft sigh and her hands went to his chest. He kissed her again, just a feather soft brush of each of her breasts, then she kissed him once more and ran her fingers down his chest to find the top of his pants. He pushed her gently against the log, his hips pressing hers, feeling the softness of her. Taking his hands and running them over her bra straps, he kissed down her neck, making his way to her collar.</p> <p>With her shirt undone he dropped to his knees.</p> <p>"What about the bra?" he asked.</p> <p>"You'll see," she said, then slid to her knees in front of him.</p> <p>His hands went right to her breasts, feeling the softness of her skin against his palms. He slowly lifted each in turn, feeling them, kneading them, caressing them.</p> <p>The sound of music and the smell of fire and smoke drifted through the air as she unclasped her bra and let it slide down her arms. Brad looked down at her beautiful body. His eyes moved over her body, noting every curve and contour. He cupped the orbs, caressed her nipples against his palms. He could smell the scent of her skin as he let his fingers slip between them, feeling how hard he could make them. Feeling his own arousal rising within him, Brad lowered his gaze to her legs and took in every inch of her. She was beautifully smooth, like soft skin that begged to be kissed, sucked, licked, stroked, squeezed, and caressed. His fingertips slid from the soft tops of her thighs to the soft skin of her thighs. He could feel the heat coming off of her skin, she was very beautiful. His fingers moved closer and closer to her pussy to feel the moisture that she generated there.</p> <p>When he touched her, he could feel a rush of desire that he didn't know he ever felt before. That feeling that the soft material of her panties was barely going to hold on to it. That feeling that she was ready for anything. "Oh, God," he moaned, looking down as his fingers gently brushed her.</p> <p>She smiled up at him, her eyes glowing in the flickering firelight. She rubbed her hands over his shoulders, feeling him through his shirt. "Do you like my body?" she asked.</p> <p>"I like your body. I like your tits," he said, kissing her again. She moved down to his hips, caressing up his thighs and belly. She lifted his t-shirt over his head, tossing it to the side. Brad's own arms went to her neck, then he ran his hands softly over her nipples that were standing up straight, hard, and proud. She gently pulled his shorts down and he stepped out of them. He pulled her to him and lifted her and sat back in the log, then they began to kiss again. His hands slid down over her stomach to the top of her panties, then slid them offâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
