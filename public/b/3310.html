I asked.</p> <p>"My name is Jack," she said as she walked into the kitchen.</p> <p>I followed her into the kitchen and sat down at the table. This is what she did all day at work, she cooked me dinner.</p> <p>"So where are we going this evening?" I asked.</p> <p>"We won't need any clothes, Will," she said.</p> <p>"I didn't know that was going to happen," I said, surprised. "What are you up to?</p> <p>"Just get me my panties," she said with a grin.</p> <p>"Oh, uh, no, we can't get you out of the house," I said, and she just laughed, a bit of a little nervous feeling in her. "I'm good," I said.</p> <p>"I don't think it's going to be that easy," she said.</p> <p>She went to retrieve her panties and put her bra and tee shirt back on.</p> <p>I'm going to meet my old college buddy tonight, and if I didn't take my panties off, we could have fun before his parents come up," I told her.</p> <p>"If I don't have any panties on," she asked.</p> <p>"No silly," I said, "but if you do, I promise you that you will look great on me."</p> <p>"I'm taking my panties off too and I'm not going to get a hard-on," she laughed. "Besides, I think I'll like that," she said, tossing her bra at me.</p> <p>I picked hers up off the floor and put it in my pocket. I went back to my room, got in my bed and waited for my dick to get hard; I didn't make it. Just before my erection had taken over, I heard her knock at the door. My heart was pounding and my back was stiff.</p> <p>She opened the door wearing her panties. They were a little white and fuzzy, and showed the dark shadow of her pussy. She smiled, and came in and sat on the other side of my bed. We were sitting there talking before I even realized that she had the covers off of me. I was trying not to get hard while she was sitting there talking to me like she said, and looking me up and down. She was right, and if I tried to look down at myself, to check if my penis had gone down, I would be in trouble.</p> <p>"Well," she said while looking at me again, "did you finish your shower?"</p> <p>I shook my head, "No," I said.</p> <p>"Well, I think you better get up, I'm going to go," she said, smiling. "And get up, because I'm going to be horny all day, tonight," she said, and she got up and went over to her bed.</p> <p>"Where did you go?" I asked, trying to figure out what she was talking about.</p> <p>She didn't seem to like talking about me. "I went across the lake," she said, "and I'm going to my cabin," she continued. "I didn't want to wake you up," she said.</p> <p>I knew from past experiences and my experience that she had the habit of telling me where she went, what time she got on the boat, what she wanted to do, and other like things that would make the time she spent in my bedroom more fun that it used to be.</p> <p>"Where are you going?" I asked, confused now.</p> <p>"I'm on my way to my cabin. Well, what time are you going?" she asked.</p> <p>"It's late, is the house still closed?" I asked.</p> <p>"It still is," she replied. "And I'll probably be a few more minutes, I'm hungry. So, get up, and let me know if there is room for you in your room," she said, and she walked over to the doors.</p> <p>I stood there wondering how I should talk to her, and if I should tell the rest of the girls at school how I acted or that I was the same one they told her about. "So, are you going?" she asked again.</p> <p>"Sure," I said, and I walked to the door, and I was standing at the door, my dick bobbing from the action I had just been doing, when she knocked again, with a bit louder this time. When I opened the door, she was standing there, in exactly the same position I got in the previous night. My dick was pointing in her direction. She looked at me and winked.</p> <p>"Hi," I said, and my dick jumped again.</p> <p>"Hello," she said, "how are you?"</p> <p>"Wow, I'm surprised," I said. "I mean, what are you doingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
