You look incredible, the way you're dressed, especially as you walk. You should be proud of yourself." He told her as he pulled her into his arms and kissed her hard letting his tongue plunge deep in her mouth. "You've certainly looked amazing."</p> <p>"I've wondered what my friends would think of me as I'm dressed up so well for our wedding, Sir." She told him.</p> <p>"You did. Your friends have been very generous of yours, especially for you. What about your dress?" he asked as he moved back so they could continue kissing once more. She had never felt so alive in all her life.</p> <p>"No, they've been too nice to refuse to come to my church for my bridal party dress. I thought it was so special and beautiful." Sarah said as they moved towards the dressing room to change.</p> <p>"I didn't know you liked weddings." He said as he opened the door. "I do, you look fantastic."</p> <p>"Well, I do. I'm glad they took their time. It's so kind of you to buy me the dresses, Sir. I've never worn anything so beautiful. I really wanted my husband to see me in sexy dresses. Are you taking me shopping again?" Sarah asked as they walked out to the car.</p> <p>"No. I'll pick up all the dresses I wanted. I just got them for you last night." He said as he opened the trunk. "When we drive over to your wedding, I'll get a few things we didn't use last time." He said as he put the car into first class.</p> <p>They talked as they drove down the road. Sarah thought this place would be perfect for their wedding. It seemed so formal, and he spoke with such confidence about the world just above his head. His friends were the wedding party, and he was their man for the day.</p> <p>It was obvious that they weren't as good a husband as he was, and it was evident to her how much they cared about her happiness. This wasn't the first wedding they had been to; before all this time it had been a private outing for them. She loved the way he kept to himself, and the way he treated her so well. All in all, this was a nice dress he had purchased for her as well.</p> <p>They reached the wedding party and walked towards the door. As they walked, they exchanged smiles, and felt the familiar tug of attraction. All the way over the reception line, he pulled her against him, and kissed her again. Sarah knew she was going to see him in the dress he would give her, and for this special occasion, she had to remember their moment of passion.</p> <p>After the reception, they stood together at the front door as they waited for the chauffeur. He didn't open the car door for her immediately as he got in with her, then drove into one of the side streets of the marina to pick up his dinner. When he reached the city, they stopped at a restaurant that was conveniently located on the waterfront. The limo driver walked around to meet them as they got off the boat and walked into the restaurant. Sarah couldn't believe how hot he was, and how he had the nerve to walk up to her, put his hands on her hips, and make her look at nothing except his wedding dress.</p> <p>He smiled as he picked her up for their formal dinner.</p> <p>"What brings you back from a long trip?" Sarah asked as they got down to the restaurant. He was dressed in a stunning cocktail dress and white knee high stockings. He was wearing his first wedding dress with white flowers, and was wearing white ankle high spike heels. It was so beautiful.</p> <p>"Well, your bridal dress is just a little short for me, but I'm really looking forward to marrying you soon. Is this your present to my friend?" he asked as he took her hand and kissed the back of it.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, that is yours." Sarah replied as he led her to a small table in the far corner, away from the people who knew him.</p> <p>They sat down and ordered their cocktails while they were waiting for the waiter to bring their dinner. It was his second wedding anniversary. They'd met in a wedding ceremony that she attended.</p> <p>"Sarah, I'd like you to meet someone, who has been my friend for years. It's my sister Janet." Janet told Sarah as she handed Sarah's drink. They talked animatedly and smiled into each other's eyes as the waiter brought their dinner. After he had been out of the dining room, they sat down side by side in what was obviously the back room of the restaurant. They were in a private booth that was adjacent to the restaurant.</p> <p>"This is our lastâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
