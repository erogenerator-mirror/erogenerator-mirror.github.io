"You mean like this?" he said. I started to argue to him, since he was going to fuck me too. It only made him laugh more. "She has been a whore to some guys, for a long time. If you're trying to get into her knickers, don't be an idiot. She's the best at everything; she's good in bed, has a great appetite...she's a great cumslut. Just think about all this; you are so hot for this woman that she's going to have you begging her for it."</p> <p>My heart was in my mouth. "No, she's not," I said honestly. I just really thought I was over her. To get to her, I had to know that she was in fact a cheating whore. That was all I wanted.</p> <p>"Well how about a little something to go along with it then," he asked.</p> <p>"Yes, I think I can do that," I said, then added to myself, "but no more than that."</p> <p>"I thought you might," he said. I started to say something else, but he had me pinned to my body. He pushed deep inside me and I was able to take him further in than before. My orgasm overtook me as his large body took mine.</p> <p>"Oh my God," I moaned as he kept fucking me. I felt like the girl who had her first sex. I didn't think I would ever need to stop. I felt a warm glow inside me, just as I remembered the way he had just fucked me. I just thought he wanted to keep fucking me longer than just one session, just like I enjoyed when he did. It was wrong, but damn he knew it, right? So wrong.</p> <p>He pulled out of my pussy just as I came with such force I was surprised. The room echoed as he kept on fucking me. I looked around the room. The windows were not shut, and even without the overhead light I could see the bed from where I was lying. I had to be careful not to cum on it. I could feel the walls around it. It looked big too; I had not had a chance to sleep in it for weeks.</p> <p>"Shit," I thought. The bed moved, and someone was moving in it. I looked out at the room I was in and saw a guy that I knew not even my husband had been before that had gotten over some sort of a weird experience the last few weeks. He looked at me and smiled. My pussy pulsed on his cock and I could feel the cum beginning its run of down into my ass. As he pulled out he pulled me off the bed and into the middle of the room. He held me, his cock still firmly inside me. "How?"</p> <p>"Oh, I was just thinking, do you wanna watch for a few minutes?" I smiled, even more confidently and not trying to get it over with. It was so different.</p> <p>"Yeah," he said simply. He took me by the shoulders and began walking me toward the bed while looking at me. He picked me up and carried me to the bed. "But don't cum yet," he ordered me with a wink. I smiled.</p> <p>"Ok," I agreed. I couldn't even look at him. He had a smile on his face. It would be nice to have someone watching while we fucked. I just wanted it to be good. He leaned forward, resting his hands on either side of me from below and kissed me. His hand moved over my body, leaving nothing untouched except the thin robe I put on. It covered my breasts at least, although I was able to feel and feel the slight outline of them through the thin material. The man who had just taken my virginity still had it on his mind, and I was glad.</p> <p>He got on the bed and started playing with my breast. He took his left hand to my hair, then ran it down my back. His other hand found its way to my pussy and he rubbed the outside of it. I shivered as he inserted a finger into my tight ass as he played with my pussy. He brought his thumb over my clit and his finger into my mouth. "Don't cum yet," I said, so he put his thumb again in my mouth. I sucked on it while his thumb fucked me, causing myself to tremble in his room.</p> <p>"Just watching someone else pleasure you," he said from a doorway, then moved over to the far side of the room. I watched his naked form moving down the hallways. Then he stopped himself. "Ok," he said. I followed himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
