He held a clipboard in one hand and a clipboard in the other. He seemed to be working on the subject. He didn't seem to be getting a good sketch of the woman.</p> <p>"Hello. Name?"</p> <p>"Elizabeth. Name?"</p> <p>"I am from Jamaica."</p> <p>"Ah. You have a name. Is this my place? I have not had visitors before."</p> <p>The man laughed. "No, no, it's my old town. I live here."</p> <p>He moved to the door. "Please go in. Just come back later. I will be in touch with you."</p> <p>"You will. My name is Elizabeth. I'm here to see my friends"</p> <p>"And I will be back at a fair bit of time."</p> <p>The man opened the door to the woman's house. The man left. Elizabeth waited while the woman returned from her shower. Elizabeth tried to speak to her once she entered her room, but the woman just laughed and pulled her arms away from her.</p> <p>The man came back out with a tall man who looked much like the man Elizabeth had met with him earlier. "I see that your friend had seen you earlier."</p> <p>"We were just leaving." Elizabeth spoke and her friends looked at her and laughed.</p> <p>"She is beautiful. I must say that I like her."</p> <p>"And I like you." Her friends said.</p> <p>The man walked over and extended his hand. "Nice to meet you Elizabeth. I'm David. Please call me David. And I'll be with you soon."</p> <p>As Elizabeth stared at the man, her thoughts went back to the two men in the next room. "Did you even know who they were? Did they even know that I exist?"</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"You wouldn't believe it if I told you!"</p> <p>David looked at the woman. "I believe that."</p> <p>"Please come inside. I will be with you shortly."</p> <p>Elizabeth hesitated only a few seconds before she moved to the other side of the room. Suddenly, she felt David and two men embrace as David pulled up her panties and took her in his arms. She cried out as she was put on display in all her naked beauty. Finally, David came to her and pulled away from David.</p> <p>"You are very beautiful."</p> <p>"Thank you. That is quite a compliment." Elizabeth stood with her arms at her side and her hands by her face. "But I have to tell you something. That man is a fool!"</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Why? I thought that you would never admit it. I would have laughed if I had heard that, had I not known."</p> <p>"Ah! Elizabeth, you are beautiful!"</p> <p>"I am also very beautiful! I know that you admire me! And even more than that, I admit that I love the attention you are getting!"</p> <p>"Really? Elizabeth, you are a gorgeous one!"</p> <p>"But... but why? Why do you think I'm beautiful? You cannot be."</p> <p>David moved closer to Elizabeth. "Well if there is such a thing as beautiful, then you are."</p> <p>Elizabeth nodded her head as she looked into David's eyes. "That's certainly true."</p> <p>"I want you to look at me," David continued, "and I want you to take a good look at me. I know that what you are doing is not right, but I don't like it. Please don't be too careful with this man."</p> <p>"I'll try to be gentle. I'm a married man."</p> <p>David took a step closer and kissed Elizabeth on the mouth. His lips quickly closed over hers. As they started to kiss, but a tiny bit of one kiss only lasted for a few seconds.</p> <p>Elizabeth felt David's body press against hers. She felt David's lips pressed into hers and his warm breath. His tongue slipped between her lips and she parted them and enjoyed the sensation of having him at her.</p> <p>The two embraced in a very passionate kiss and Elizabeth kissed him back. After a few minutes of kissing, David started to unbutton her blouse.</p> <p>Elizabeth stood and pushed away from David with her hands on his sides. "Please. Just do it, you can have us both."</p> <p>David started to take off her blouse. She took it off. Before being able to take it off, David put it on a chair and leaned on the side of Elizabeth's shoulder. Elizabeth sat down slowly and David walked up to her. She took his face in her hands and kissed him again.</p> <p>David grabbed her by the hands and slowly unbuttoned Elizabeth's coat. The woman's shirt fell to the floor. Their embrace continued and they made out for a few moments. It was all either of them couldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
