"I got you for such a pretty girl.</p> <p>"And I'm pretty well prepared to be his own woman, even if only to fuck the hell out of me!" he huffed.</p> <p>"What's that want?</p> <p>"It's not sex, love," he said. "It's just one of the perks of being a married man."</p> <p>"But you are?" she asked, putting her hands on his chest and pressing him to her.</p> <p>"Well, all to hell with that!" he chided. "I get to have my way with you, now!"</p> <p>They continued to make out for the rest of the night.</p> <p>Chapter 13 - Saturday</p> <p>On the surface, the first night they made love seemed like the worst sex ever. But then the next morning, the thought made her horny again. She had gotten off in the bathroom and returned to the bedroom. Tom, still in his boxer-briefs, was lying on his back on the bed beside her. He pulled the sheet over them both.</p> <p>She was looking down at his face for the first time. Her hand was gently stroking his chest and stomach, which was exposed from his boxer shorts. Her heart was pounding and her pussy was wet.</p> <p>"Well," she said in a matter of perspective voice, "I guess that means we did."</p> <p>"You mean you got off?" Tom asked with a smirk.</p> <p>"Yeah," she whispered. "It's been a while since I did it to you."</p> <p>"You know how to make it a night like no other," he said, looking at her face. She smiled again and then rolled over on top of him.</p> <p>"That was nice, baby," she said. "You have had a lot to offer me this time."</p> <p>"You think?"</p> <p>She thought.</p> <p>And the next day, she met Jason at the mall. She hadn't done anything yet but she had been looking forward to going on a trip to the beach.</p> <p>She'd taken the day off from work and had a late flight. She thought about Jason briefly and then decided to get him alone and to enjoy his company. The rest of the day had been a blur for her.</p> <p>She thought how much she loved him. She had gotten that feeling that she needed to do something for him and he wanted to do something for her. She needed another man.</p> <p>But Tom's idea was different. It had been a very long time since she had made love to a man like that and she was just thinking about it.</p> <p>She looked over the guy to see what his reaction was. There was a nice, muscular man in her field of vision at the far end of the aisle.</p> <p>He wasn't all that hot.</p> <p>He had that look of an athlete with his tight, tan body that looked good in a suit if not on an athlete, with his green eyes and jet black hair. He was lean, athletic looking and looked athletic and strong and it was hard to tell he was in his early forties.</p> <p>It was kind of a classic look of an athlete but in a good, comfortable way. She looked down in the aisle to see what his reaction was as she turned her eyes back to him.</p> <p>And this man was young, obviously very nervous. He had some sort of European accent, a little nervous, sort of like, 'this is going to be fine.'</p> <p>That look was unmistakable, she thought.</p> <p>She smiled at him as she approached him. "Hey," she said. "Hope you are okay."</p> <p>He smiled. "Better than okay, actually. You have made it happen."</p> <p>"Really? Oh, you are really going to come back? With us?" she asked.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah. That would be wonderful," he said. "We need a drink, if that's all right with you."</p> <p>"I'm ready to party the night away," she said. "Have more fun with our friend, I mean. We really are gonna enjoy ourselves."</p> <p>"We can't," he said. "No way! "</p> <p>"But you are a nice looking young guy," she said, smiling at him. "You could get all the ladies in town to jump you. Besides, we are going to be in town for the next week or two in anticipation of a great party."</p> <p>"Really?" He asked. "No big deal?"</p> <p>"Yes," she said. "You'll get out every weekend."</p> <p>"Can't promise it won't be an entire weekend?" heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
