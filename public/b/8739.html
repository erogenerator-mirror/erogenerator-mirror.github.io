It was your sister's phone, which was your sister's last number. You didn't recognize it so you quickly responded saying my call sounded like it belonged to you. You had just hung up when you heard your sister call on the phone and your brain started to run.</p> <p>The way you acted, the way you said you needed my number was all a bit too much for you. You didn't even consider it when your sister had left your voicemail message on the phone, but it still scared you so much that you had completely lost control of it. You were getting scared that someone could call the police.</p> <p>There was another text alert, "You have my number, please don't come to the bathroom at all" you didn't even react as your mouth fell open. You typed back, "Fuck!"</p> <p>The phone beeped again, "Oh...hey bro. How was your night?" I replied.</p> <p>"Fine, but not as I remember. I'm at my mom's, my aunt is out of town." I explained. I was going to explain what happened, but I was nervous about it at the same time.</p> <p>After a few minutes of searching and a bit of searching while I listened in on your sister's voice I eventually got to what was going on in your head. You were on your way home from school and it was obvious that you hadn't gotten out of the house to check your phone.</p> <p>The last thing you heard was "Ok" as you listened to your cell phone.</p> <p>"What?!"</p> <p>"What's up." I replied as you pulled up your car and entered your mom's house.</p> <p>"You are the most beautiful man alive," you replied as you slammed the car door and walked up to your bedroom.</p> <p>You stood there looking around until you spotted your dresser. As you sat on the edge of your bed you realized your night dress was gone. What you would have never noticed was that the hem was now only about 3 inches above your knee.</p> <p>With a little shock you found yourself leaning over your dresser with your phone beside you. The top three buttons were undone; no surprise, you had no bra or panties on to begin with. Your whole right breast was hanging free from your dress. You closed your eyes as you took your time looking at my photo.</p> <p>"It is beautiful, thank you." You thought to yourself "I love your body."</p> <p>You took your phone out of your pocket and pulled out another photo of your back. It was not really a photo from you because you could see that your butt had also disappeared. It was a picture of your beautiful long legs. The rest of the photo just showed your ass and that you were in the right situation to be looking at it, so the bottom was the same. "I know that would be impossible to explain to you. My sister and I would be in our underwear. We've never really done anything like this before," you thought.</p> <p>"Well, why would I be embarrassed?"You asked.</p> <p>"Oh, is it just to ask, you know? To look at when I walk up to you? I don't get it. I mean, this is just what I wanted and had wanted and needed." My voice was quiet, but I could hear the gears in your mind spinning.</p> <p>You looked at my picture again, trying to take in what your mind was working on. You noticed a couple of the last pictures showing your ass, though they were not really a picture. They were in more than 1 person's view. You were looking at a close up of you and your ass. You couldn't even imagine what it look like to you. It was an awesome view and you could feel it. You couldn't remember the last time you had felt lust at looking at someone else's ass.</p> <p>"I think I will see you tonight," you said in a very breathless voice as your mouth hung agape. I can't even imagine being in this position right now. Here I am almost naked, in front of my sister's neighbor and it is your own little sister with her phone camera focused in my underwear.</p> <p>You took your phone out of your pocket and looked at my picture. "Why am I such a tease? Is it just because you are wearing so much lace and stuff?"</p> <p>You knew that you had me when you asked, but you didn't really believe me. You didn't know what kind of person I was. All you knew was that you were attracted to me. You had wanted me for so long you were afraid that you would not be able to go through with it.</p> <p>"Do I have toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
