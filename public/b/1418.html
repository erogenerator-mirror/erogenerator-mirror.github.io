He wasn't looking at the computer, but at me.</p> <p>"Me neither."</p> <p>We were quiet for a bit and he continued to read his book for a bit.</p> <p>"I think I'm tired. It's been a very long day," I said. His hand went back down to my leg just as though he had never touched me.</p> <p>"Maybe," he said. I could just picture how that would be.</p> <p>"Maybe. Maybe there's something I ought to do?"</p> <p>"I'm good to go," he said.</p> <p>"Good for me? Good for a while."</p> <p>"Oh, good for a start."</p> <p>"Just so you know, I'm looking forward to watching the movie again. Maybe tomorrow." It made the question I asked so obvious even to him. "The day after tomorrow."</p> <p>"Yes, I'm looking forward to watching the movie again." He gave me another smile. I looked at him and saw the big, dark one and smiled.</p> <p>"I've been thinking about you ever since I saw you at the party with that bag of yours in my lap in the driveway. It's been a fantasy of mine all day."</p> <p>Oh, I loved the thought of him seeing my tits. I felt the warmth of his chest against my bare back as one of our robes fell open. I felt his lips on my shoulder. Our skin met. I felt something, as soon as I felt his lips on my bare shoulder, my hands were in his lap. My hands found his face. I could feel his eyes on me. I felt his hand reach across, I could feel it under my nightdress as it went high over my mound. Just as I was about to feel the first warm rush of pleasure, he said: "I love your breasts." I heard a click which made me almost jump out of my skin. I looked down to see that his belt had been undone and his belt already open. I was standing on the side of the bed and then I saw his hand slide up between my legs. I looked back and saw that his lips were there and we kissed and we kissed again. I could sense the hardness of the other hand as it ran under my nightdress and felt the warmth of the other. We stopped and kissed a while. I could feel his hand running up the inside of my upper leg toward my mound. He lifted my nightdress and pulled it off my shoulders, to the floor, in a single movement. Then while I stood there in my nightdress, he took off his robe. Just as he dropped it to the floor and we kissed again he slid the nightdress over my head and I stood there, in my nightdress, with the only thing that still covered me with nothing on underneath. I could already feel him pushing his cock hard down into me. My breasts were only a few inches from his face and I could feel its heat and weight as it pushed into me through the thin material of my gown. It felt almost as good as it looked and it was already all I could think about. We kissed some more as my hands found his cock and he pushed it up against me.</p> <p>He turned me around and sat down on the bed where I'd been. I felt myself spread wide on the bed as he kissed my upper back and then his arms went around me and his hands began to slowly feel around my stomach. He slid a finger under the back of my nightdress and onto my mound. I felt his finger slide across my outer lips. He was gentle with them, running his fingers around my opening then inside me a bit, going inside a bit, all the way. He touched me there but then he took his finger away and pulled at my lips, opening them up.</p> <p>"You don't have to do that."</p> <p>He looked at me in the dim light of the bedroom for a minute. "You know it's a fantasy of yours all day," he said.</p> <p>"I know, but it's one of the greatest things about it."</p> <p>His hands moved on my inner thigh and he pushed on my legs together, then pulled my legs apart and then lifted them up and I felt the coolness of a sheet on my skin. He did the same with the other leg.</p> <p>He lifted my legs over his shoulders and I lifted them up, feeling the softness of them on his shoulders, which he leaned all the way up over me. His chest was on top of me as I rested them one at a time on his arms, while he kissed me. I moved my legs just enough to raise my hips upward and felt his cock push into me, my lips. He lifted one leg and pushed it forward until it met the wall of my pussy.</p> <p>"You're so wet.
