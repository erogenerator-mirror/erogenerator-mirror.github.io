We walked out to the porch steps and then I asked him about the house I'd bought. He grinned and told me I could borrow. We kissed and he let me lead the way. I was glad for it. The rest of the walk to my house, I could feel myself wet between the legs as I walked. I was really glad I had brought panties with me as well.</p> <p>We walked the first two blocks to my house and he stopped to help me into the little one bedroom. I didn't dare ask him around but I knew if he knew it was all a one-room house I felt safe enough. He closed the door behind us and I took a moment to look around. The room was a large kitchen and I was glad I had a spare key with me. I could have easily gotten more use to it. My heart sunk when I took a look in the mirror. I did not like what I saw.</p> <p>Darling! It didn't even occur to me. I had never done anything like that before. I was so embarrassed but at the same time I was really happy. I put my little hands on his shoulders and tried to think about just what to wear that week for the party. I put my things in my bedroom and left him in the kitchen for fifteen minutes or so.</p> <p>It was a huge house and I was a little sad I had to leave as quickly as I had but I had no way to get home without ruining things. I had to see what was keeping him and why if I would hurry then we would see each other and he would not have to see me. We stood there looking at each other for a minute, then he pulled me up and kissed me with what you might call an 'old-fashioned' kiss. In the end I was very embarrassed and couldn't explain it. We stopped and I held him. He was so strong and I think the first thing we both realized the entire week after the end of our first date was a kiss. He really knows how to kiss. Our kissing was so nice and tender it was unbelievable. It was one way to say we have been dating until tonight and that it would do both of us and us no harm as long as we kept it strictly from being spontaneous.</p> <p>I started to ask him after our kiss if he knew how to kiss for our last date but he stopped me and he said he would be back in a while if it was all right with me. The next thing I knew, the bedroom door bell rang and I rushed in to answer it only to find it was Mr. O'Connor. His face was that look you are afraid to show and I felt a little shiver race up my spine and I wanted to tell him to go away, so I made a face, grabbed the damn thing and went to answer the door. I was in the lobby waiting for the door to open and then there was a knock at the door. Oh no! I started to say something then he pulled me into his arms and kissed me so hard I had to breath in and then kissed back. I didn't want to be kissed. I didn't want him. I didn't want this moment of our relationship to ever end. He stopped and I heard the knock again, then a third time and then a fourth time before the door opened again. Mr. O'Connor saw me through the door and stood as he said: "Mrs. Tisdale's parents are here. He knocked a bit louder then he should have. They came in and there were two dozen or so people at our table." They were all very nice, including Mrs. O'Connor. I could tell that was a disappointment.</p> <p>Suddenly, my heart started pounding and I couldn't help but think about Mr. O'Connor kissing me. I was going to say something to stop that but he pulled away and stood there shaking like an idiot. "Mrs. Tisdale is this good?" He asked as he sat down. I sat down and he smiled that same self-assurance smile he had in the beginning. I just couldn't do anything but nod. "My mom was right, you are a pretty great kisser," Mr. O'Connor said with a twinkle in his eyes.</p> <p>I really wished I could say something to stop him but I couldn't. He wasn't going to go away without saying something because as much as I wished that I didn't, I couldn't do it. He asked where I lived and I told him. He wanted to know where I would live since I lived only about a half-hour's drive away. He just smiled and said: "I can drive you over there," as he pointed.</p> <p>He drove so fast that I wasn't sure where we were when the two of us got out. "Where to? In your car?" he asked with a smile.</p> <p>"In your car?"
