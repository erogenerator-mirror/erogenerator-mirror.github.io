"Don't you worry about that." He kissed her lips again, again and again and again, and she had to smile. When he pulled away, she had the feeling that she was going to explode.</p> <p>"Are you okay? Does he hurt you?" James asked as he wrapped his arms around her again.</p> <p>"He shouldn't, but... oh God..." Melissa said, shaking uncontrollably as another wave of pleasure rushed through her body. James wrapped his arms around her again and pushed her even more, so she wouldn't fall over. He kissed her lips again, then her neck. Melissa's heart pounded as he took her into his arms, and he held her tightly against him. She felt like she was floating, but when he kissed her neck, she just lay there, letting him lead her, and not caring. She loved how his lips and hands felt on her body... that's a first for her and she wasn't sure whether she preferred him or not.</p> <p>When he stopped sucking on her neck, a drop of sweat ran down her cleavage. At least she thought she was sweating. James kissed her again, and Melissa moaned. If she couldn't have that, she could have sworn she could smell his sweat, but wasn't able to say that.</p> <p>"Are you okay?" he asked as he kissed her lips again.</p> <p>"I... I'm fine." She whispered.</p> <p>"I'm so sorry," he said and she shivered all over as he bit her lip so lightly. His hand caressed her neck, then back to her face. "I'm sorry you felt that way. I didn't want to hurt you."</p> <p>"Stop it," Melissa pleaded. "Please..."</p> <p>"Not yet," he said and he ran his hand between her breasts again. She shivered again as he slid his fingers into her valley, and slowly pushed against her until she was completely open to him.</p> <p>Melissa wanted to feel him inside of her, for him to make love to her. She was scared and upset. Her body couldn't help but feel like a ripe fruit that wanted to be nurtured, but didn't want it to. She was scared to feel him. But there was still something about her that had her feeling guilty and excited. She felt like she could feel the energy that would come out of her as his manhood pushed inside her.</p> <p>James kissed her nose, cheek, and then her forehead, before his lips touched hers for the first time in over a month. He was careful not to break the kiss. Melissa knew that kissing would be the most intimate contact she had ever had with him, and even though she wasn't sure if she wanted to do this, she didn't want him to be the one to initiate it. She opened her mouth to allow him gently, and he ran his tongue over his lips and across hers. He slowly sucked her tongue into his mouth and gently explored her lips, teeth, and tongue. He felt her body react and she almost couldn't breathe. This was all so perfect, and so very wrong.</p> <p>"Oh, James... James..." Melissa moaned in his mouth. There was such an intense rush of desire, and then it was gone. He pressed against her and pressed down even harder against her. He lifted her chin up so their eyes met for the first time since they started kissing. Her breath came in jerky gasps. She looked into his eyes, searching for the love she felt in there. It was impossible to find it. He had only known it for so long, and he saw her as being so beautiful in his mind's eye and he wanted to be her.</p> <p>"I love you," he whispered as he kissed her forehead again.</p> <p>"I love you," Melissa whispered back, and she saw how his tongue moved across his lips, as though he wanted it to stay with her forever. She kissed him again as he lowered his mouth to hers once more. She felt her body respond to him as she felt him move against her, his hands running the backs of their hands over her backside and ass as they shared the soft moment of being one.</p> <p>And then all at once he pushed her against the bed and moved on top of her, his cock hard and throbbing deep inside of her. "Wait!"she cried out, and James released her hands as he pinned them above her head.</p> <p>"What?" he asked, surprised and shocked. What was he doing? Why did his body react to hers like this?</p> <p>"I want you. I want you to know that I love you." she finished and she could see in his eyes that he was a little drunk but it didn't seem wrong.</p> <p>"I... I don't know how I should feel. I don't know why I feel this way. I... I think I should leaveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
