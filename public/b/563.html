I leaned against the wall so, once again, she was standing just two inches from me, as she ran out of hair to one side of her shoulders and kissed me softly, as if the kisses were the start of the journey to a romantic union.</p> <p>"Thank you," I said as she pulled back a little, catching my breath, "You're not just saying that, you're amazing. I don't know if I could have imagined being so fortunate on any level at all. It's just that you're a nice lady and a wonderful person. Even in the worst possible nightmare you're the most caring, romantic, kind and beautiful woman I've ever met."</p> <p>"I'm not the least bit worried about what you might do next. I've just recently discovered I never have been very smart or clever in my school life, in fact I'm a little scared of the kind of people who are going to be trying to help me," she said as she put her arms around my waist, "I never had anybody else as good as you in my life and I'm going to have you in my bed again as soon as possible." "I didn't know you felt that much for me," I said as she kissed me again, "I don't mean to be the kind of romantic woman that you're going to fall asleep on the way to sleep with the man you love." I let her kiss me long and hard, pushing her back to sit down on my lap and wrapping her legs around my own, our mouths making sweet love to each other.</p> <p>"Oh God, it was so good last night," she moaned softly, "I don't know what to expect but I did let the night go by so slowly and gently." She pulled away and looked me in the eyes and said softly, "I wasn't very experienced at the most," she added as she rubbed her cheek against mine, "I never thought what being with you would do to me because it wasn't me with my husband anyway."</p> <p>"I did," I said quietly, "The idea of you being with another man and sharing him with me never crossed my mind that night. Of course I'm not a monster," I said as I kissed her and hugged her close tightly.</p> <p>"What was that all about?" she whispered in my ear as we broke the kiss, "That you had another man in your bed?"</p> <p>"We just sort of stumbled across it together," I said softly while kissing the corner of her mouth "I was just having a relaxing night with you, you being with another man and all." I slipped one hand down over her naked hip and slowly moved it from front to back so I could caress her firm, warm flesh with my hand. I knew there was nothing that could be done but gently and lovingly so I leaned back against the wall, giving her room to pull herself away from me so I could kiss her, to feel the warmth of her mouth.</p> <p>She rested her head on my shoulder as I gently squeezed her hip with my hand and kissed her lips gently, teasing her.</p> <p>"You know, I'm feeling a bit nervous about this whole thing," she said, her eyes misting up a little "I mean, it seems like every guy in school would be asking me what was going down, if I got lucky," she giggled as she kissed my ear and then slowly worked her way down my jaw line until she found my lips and kissed me gently. She slid her hands up my shirt and gently massaged my breasts as our kissing continued. I lifted my arms and pulled my arms up high above my head so she could have full access to my chest as she unbuttoned my top. She pulled the shirt off and then leaned over me with the other hand and looked up at me for a moment before whispering, "I can't believe this is happening," before she ran her tongue down the side of my neck and then started to run her lips over my ear and down my torso.</p> <p>We were in the middle of my bedroom floor, in the middle of the room. We were in a hallway way in back. Our backs were to each other. She bent her head and gently kissed the side of my face, moving to my earlobe and planting a slow, passionate kiss on me.</p> <p>She pulled my hands away from my sides slowly and began to slowly unhook my bra. I slowly slid my hands down from hers, placing them into the waistband of her panties where they were. She slid my panties down as she pulled them off my shoulders and off. When they finally fell to the floor she pushed them into my face so I could kiss them. She began to kiss me so softly and sweetly onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
