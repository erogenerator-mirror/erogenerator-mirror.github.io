"Where's the little one?" John asked, grinning at the look on her face. She had her hand in the middle of his chest, her face turned towards him. She took his face between her hands and started to kiss him hard. As their kiss broke, she said, "I can't wait to get home. I feel as if I'll never be able to walk."</p> <p>"You'd better," he said, kissing her again. "I think we'll have fun."</p> <p>"I think so," she said. "Let's get going, then." She stood up, and kissed him again. "I'm starving. Come on," she said to him, "and we'd better change the restaurant and go shopping."</p> <p>"I'm going to put that away."</p> <p>He went to the bar and put in on the phone. Then he went to the bathroom, got in his cart and walked out. He put the phone back in its cradle. Walking out the front of the apartment, he paused. Looking at the apartment, he saw that it was dark except for the flickering glow of the streetlights outside. He went back to the parking lot and got into the car. In the back seat of the car, he put on his street clothes, a change of clothes for a night out.</p> <p>He thought about going back to her apartment when he arrived back at the restaurant. This time, he just wanted to stay inside. She would be gone for an hour, leaving him alone with his thoughts. He remembered the last time he had stayed at her apartment. His heart started to beat faster with every minute that passed. He thought about putting on a pair of shorts and just walking out the door. He remembered how wet he'd gotten. He didn't mean it.</p> <p>As he left, he felt better than he had been the past two weeks. He started to put on his shirt, but decided that putting on his shorts was not the best route. He got a wash cloth and started to wipe up the wet spots from the road before he could leave. He washed his hands, then put on his shirt and left the wash cloth in the washbasin before walking back into the restaurant.</p> <p>John walked up to the front counter. It was quiet with the sound coming from the back room. "Just to get back to the front desk, sir," she said to the back of his head when he started to walk back towards her. He stopped, turned around and waited. When he was a step from her, he stopped. "Excuse me?" he said.</p> <p>"Oh, hey, John," she said with a smile. "I'm going to make myself comfortable." She turned towards a tall man in a hotel robe who looked like he was in his fifties.</p> <p>"Oh," he said, "I'm sorry to interrupt, are you, John?" She smiled at him. "Hello? You can call me John." She gestured towards the man. "You're John, right??"</p> <p>"Yeah...um...yeah, sure. Is there something wrong with me?"</p> <p>"Well, I was just wondering if you wanted a table," she said. "The place is very dark so I was just going to get a booth," she said, then left the men's room area. "This way," as she closed the door behind her to make sure he could not hear her. She walked with him into the dining room, sitting him down a chair. "How do you like that room?" she asked the man.</p> <p>"Sure, it's nice. It's comfortable to be here with you again. I think I'm a big fan of your cuisine, sir," he replied. "I know some good places here."</p> <p>He reached for the waiter, but she said, "Please, put away the menus," and stood up. "Thank you for asking," she said, then walked out onto the terrace. She sat down on a chair and the waiter walked back to the table while the men waited for the table. "Did you get all this menu?" she asked. He was looking up at the pictures of great cheeses on the wall when she put her index finger up to her mouth. He smiled.</p> <p>"My treat," he said as he sat down beside her. "It must be about thirty-six years in the making since we last got here..." as he took of his shirt and left the waiter a tab. "And I thought I might know what you liked."</p> <p>"No," Kate said. "We have a lot of what you like...a real treat coming from you."</p> <p>The waiter came back with the menus, and they began to eat. It was a nice lunch, with them both enjoying itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
