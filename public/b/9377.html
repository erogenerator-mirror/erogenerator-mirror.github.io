We need to discuss things. And I'm in it for the long haul."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>We arrived at the beach house and were in an embrace, a passionate kiss, with a passion of our own that felt like sparks fly. The house was a good fit as we fit. It had a nice beach, which was actually quite impressive with the huge bedroom, the kitchenette and hot tub in the bathroom, and an open plan living area that was decorated in a dark green that looked like it was finished with the typical family home theme.</p> <p>"I want you," I blurted out in a low voice. "We need to do something big before we make...this move," I muttered.</p> <p>She had one of her palms placed firmly flat against her belly in a gesture as if she was giving it an 'ass-up' sign. I was surprised for a brief moment when she did that.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I know that sounds cheesy but I couldn't help it. You are my friend," she apologized, in a way that was sincere and sweet, "and I know that's what was gonna take time. If there is anything you need...anything you want to talk about, talk about, we can do it."</p> <p>"You are definitely different than most girls, you're a beautiful, sensual being. I'll never forget the last time I saw you and you made me feel...gorgeous. And now I'm your friend," I said, "I can tell something else too. So what's the problem? You aren't comfortable with it but I can't help but want to make good on those promises we discussed the other day."</p> <p>"I have to admit that it's a little overwhelming. But I've had these feelings of my life before...and it seems that for some reason I could never be the same again. But what I can't seem to understand is why we need to be doing this now. I can't give you a big wedding gift right now..."</p> <p>"Because if we are going to do this, the only thing we have to do is talk," I said. I felt the tension leave me. There was no way that we could continue living a romantic relationship like this, with her so openly in our lives. I felt so...empty.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" she asked.</p> <p>"The other day, I wanted the other time. I wanted to make you feel good. So I made you feel good. And I didn't want to cause any...pain," I said, "So I wanted to make you feel good."</p> <p>I could see my tone as it dropped and dropped under the weight of her weight, down to hers.</p> <p>"Oh no, Jack, don't change your thoughts. You will feel good later. After tonight you can make sense of things. So let's make this work. The only thing in here you can really know for sure is that you are not gay but you are a guy, and that you just want to have a good time with...you. The only way I can see you has a way of taking it," she said.</p> <p>"Really," I said emphatically. I liked that little extra bit. "I wasn't sure if you really meant everything you said. You were a beautiful person and...and I...I'm not going to hurt you. I just want to make you feel good. And the only way I could..."</p> <p>"There is no need to be scared, Jack," she said, "and I'm not going to hurt you either. We are all friends here too. I want to make you feel good. I don't want to go on the road out of control or the road behind us. We need to make this more clear by trying to make you feel good. If you want, I can give you a bit of a push."</p> <p>I was still in my boxers and was feeling a little vulnerable, but the heat in her gaze was comforting. She seemed to be a little calmer, maybe a little more composed, and she was not upset by what I had just said. She was definitely ready to help me.</p> <p>She started to take off her robe, then turned around and dropped the robe. She slipped out of her bikini bottoms and stepped out of them, revealing a neatly-cropped bush that looked just a little like...that hair. Her pubes, when it was completely shaved, were nicely shaped and her bush looked really sexy as she turned and spread her towel to show us that she shaved it. She sat down on the towel and spread herself open, exposing her neatly groomed pink outer lips and pink inner lips and what I couldnâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
