I said, sitting up on her lap again after a few times of gentle caresses.</p> <p>"Mmm... I'll give you all the things you need!" I said, my little pout on my face while still looking to see how she would react.</p> <p>- "I think we all need it now!" She said, turning around and bending down. "But I think you're in for just one big ride tonight. Are you sure we'll have time?" she asked as she grabbed my cock and squeezed hard, causing a shiver to ripple through my body before she quickly bent down to put some lube on my shaft.</p> <p>- "Ready for it?" I asked. She looked at me, her mouth still wrapped around the head of my cock and I knew I couldn't hold out much longer. "Oh my god you're so big!" she managed to say before backing off and quickly grabbing a pillow. She pushed it under my cock and pushed it back in, the next couple of movements she made in turn getting both of her toys in both her holes. I held her hips as she pushed the toy from her ass and my cock forward, the sound of it squishing wetly as it was crammed in was music to my ears. I took both sides of the pillow and used the pillow to slide my cock in and out slightly, the sound of her ass cheeks being squished wetly as I did so was music to my ears.</p> <p>- "You do that, that's it! That's right! Just like that!" I said as I leaned forward and leaned into her as she moaned in approval. "You feel so good. You know how much we love you?" I asked.</p> <p>- "We don't love you, but you know what's best for us?" I said.</p> <p>- "Then we'll have to wait." she replied.</p> <p>- "We have to wait, but I think we can wait. If all goes well, then we don't have to do this for an awful long time!" I said, knowing how much of a commitment it was to wait for her first time.</p> <p>- "Don't make me break my promise too soon. I don't know why I wouldn't try and be good for you at all!" she said with a grin, pulling me down with her.</p> <p>- "That was a nice idea, and I certainly didn't know that was possible so soon after being with you for so long!" I said.</p> <p>- "Good, it's going to be just as good for us both." She said as she leaned into me once again kissing me passionately. "So we'll wait until we're both satisfied... before our first time..."</p> <p>She pulled herself off and started playing with a ball sack of her toys. "Come on, we need another rubber." she said, pointing to the bag on the table. "And we're both going to need something to wipe off our dirty ones."</p> <p>By now I was half reclined on her bed, her legs spread wide as she went through the toy bag and laid it gently on my side of the bed. When she found nothing, she looked up at me, looking me in the eyes as she turned the vibe on once again. "Do you want to be dirty for me, or do we need to wait." she asked.</p> <p>- "We do need to wait. But I think we need a little extra help." I answered.</p> <p>- "I don't know just how to tell you exactly how you'll be dirty for me." she said as she stood up, the other end of the toys still in the bag, setting one down on the bed right in front of me.</p> <p>- "And I'm not asking you to be an old pro for me." I said as I lay back down.</p> <p>- "Oh you are. I think we've got a lot in common now. And as with everything else, I'll just have to decide that when the time is right." She said as she pulled up her panties to leave a trail of her wetness all along my body. With her legs straddling my body, she pushed me back on the bed. I grabbed the toy as she knelt down astride me again and pulled it from my body. I took in the sight of her breasts as she lay on top of me again, only this time her lower body came down on me as she started her ass onto me again. She rubbed herself up and down my shaft as she felt for the tip, and pushed gently forward, teasing my head to the tip with her ass.</p> <p>- "Are you sure you want me to do this?" sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
