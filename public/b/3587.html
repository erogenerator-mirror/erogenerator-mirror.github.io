A tear rolled from the corners of her mouth and her body shuddered with the emotion she felt. I sat looking at her, trying to understand what she had just done. Had I heard right, she had just sucked him off and swallowed his seed? For what reason, I had simply not put it into my life, it just felt wrong to say those words. It was as if my mother was asking me to tell her. That this was how I felt, my father would do for me. I had always considered it odd that incest was more of a perverted fantasy then I wanted to admit to myself. My father must have read my mind as he looked at my reflection as I was sitting on the toilet.</p> <p>"It's okay, I understand, I know I should've felt guilty and ashamed and ashamed, but I just couldn't, I just had to." I looked at my reflection. I was ashamed to be what I had become and I knew that I had gone back to my old way of thinking with my father. It had seemed so wrong to think that there were people doing it; it was like I was a child being punished. I didn't mean to be crude but it was all I could think... it was my father, the man that loves me, the man that I am with, that I want...to be with.</p> <p>The guilt was hard to shake off. I wasn't going to just do this, do what she demanded. I had no doubt in my mind; in fact, I doubted many people would do what I was about to do. Yet, here I was, my mother, the son of my father and this man, she wanted to be with me. I had no choice but to get back to my task, this was so unlike me; how could I refuse to be his and be his wife?</p> <p>I couldn't let myself do things like that because of her. Yet, that wasn't the case anymore. This act, this act of disrespect, it was the same thing that had happened to me, the same thing that I had done that day. My father never would have done what she did and it was just as wrong to think it. Yet, he had. For the most part, it seemed like we both understood each other. The guilt was stronger then, in fact, it was stronger then but there was more to it in my way of looking at the events.</p> <p>"I'm sorry mom, I didn't mean to be so mean," I muttered as a second thought popped in. This was so much like what I imagined would happen to me, to her.</p> <p>"No," she said firmly, "it's okay."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, mom," I said as firmly, "I didn't mean to..."</p> <p>"Hah, that's okay! Hah, you don't mind, do you?" she snorted, "I'm getting a bit worried though. There must be others, I think," she said with a sigh. I had only assumed she was going to explain to my father that I was their daughter. Yet, with a shrug, "I guess... that I know it would be just a bit strange. Still, maybe," she said, "for all these years, we should try out something a little different."</p> <p>"What, is I not her," I retorted while laughing. I was having a hard time keeping my sarcasm from flowing around the tablecloth.</p> <p>"Yes, you're my son," my mother answered me. Then, she said to me, "What would I be to you if I was to become your own woman? I'm married to the man that loves you!"</p> <p>I took a swig of my soda and tried not to be too pleased. She was right. For the first time in a long time, my father let me talk... he understood. And the way I acted I would have done it any time that he wanted me to. She was right, he didn't force me to do it. In fact, no one forced me to do anything. I felt as normal as ever as I spoke out. Yet, I still had feelings for my father and that bothered me something. I wanted more then sex but my father didn't seem to like it... he was a demanding man, more demanding then I was, and no one was willing to be that way with my father.</p> <p>"Why me, Mom," I muttered, "I think what we have in common, what we share, is that we share the same heart. I still haven't understood any of what you just said."</p> <p>"Oh dear," my mother said, "I was just being practical."</p> <p>"You're not, at least notâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
