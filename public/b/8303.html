"Of course," I said, "What else do they do? I mean."</p> <p>Andrea got really serious. She looked away, shaking her head once. "How is that possible, you moron?" And so it started again, this time with Amy, "I mean...not in the least, though, really...what they do? "</p> <p>"Huh?" Amy said, then stopped and looked back.</p> <p>"I'm not sure," Rebecca said, "They might have had a reason or something, I'm not sure."</p> <p>"Okay, I think I made more sense in a dream than in actually believing something," She said, looking up.</p> <p>"So that's something you were doing," Rebecca said.</p> <p>"It actually felt pretty weird to have a guy come in and not only do all that to me but also to the guy himself," She smiled sadly, "And yet I felt more than that at the time. You know, you could have seen his eyes and ears, or his hands. Or he might have known which of those things was which!"</p> <p>We all laughed. There was an after-party discussion.</p> <p>In the end, it began with a little girl, but we did not notice the resemblance until after the party. My girl Andrea was pretty similar. She had the same hair. Her eyes looked a little younger. She had a similar build, but I could see they were not from a mirror, but from a friend of mine in university. Her body was slender and smooth. She was not as tall as you might expect or as fat as you might expect, but she was a good looking kid, and in truth, I think we all felt that she deserved to be seen with, not just because we were all very much alike, but because of the fact that she had a crush on me, maybe even more than Rebecca.</p> <p>I saw Amy and Rebecca chatting for a while, but soon it became quiet except for some of the others, and Rebecca's words, and for a while I could tell that Amy was listening, too.</p> <p>"You should have seen the people! They were all going to be going away with me after tonight so this time they'd stay with us," She said, in a mockingly cheerful tone, "They would all be going out with us!"</p> <p>"You're kidding me!"</p> <p>"They may not be all going away," My girl Andrea said, and Amy grinned, shaking her head, and I could tell there was no point in saying anything else, "I don't think there will be any 'girls' in 'our place', do you?"</p> <p>"You know, it's just that this weekend was a kind of dream come true, if you know what I mean," Rebecca said, and then paused. "I mean, you can't really expect us to sleep alone all week, we are the same size!"</p> <p>"How's that?" Rebecca asked.</p> <p>"Well, if you could just go off alone, and pick one of us up every other night, just to sleep together in your room, that wouldn't be so bad, and we can stay in your room, too,"</p> <p>Amy looked a little relieved, "Just go to your room tomorrow morning, I think."</p> <p>Rebecca and Amy looked at each other, then back at me, then back to each other, then back to each other. Finally they spoke, "If you don't do it, I am not sure what the hell we will be doing," Rebecca said. "I mean, I really would feel like I know you and I can't have any of my own."</p> <p>"The hell if I know you," I said. "Why don't you come with my sister this weekend?"</p> <p>"We'll be busy," Amy said, "My friend Amy can pick you up in the car and we can leave for the night."</p> <p>The rest of the group had finished their drinks and were waiting for us with smiles wide so that we might not recognize them at first. Rebecca was grinning again, and they all cheered. I knew what my sister must have been thinking. Rebecca was a little girl. At only eleven years old, but she was really a little woman, and had probably always been pretty nice to me. But this was really going to be a new experience by ourselves, and I really wanted to know whether Andrea was going to be okay with it.
