"I feel much better now. Lets get a taxi..."</p> <p>The cabby said something to the driver. After being delayed on the way for less than half an hour, I paid the cabby, and got out of the cab after my legs were shaking a bit. As they were starting to go down the street, I turned and said,</p> <p>"Don't you want to kiss me?"</p> <p>He looked surprised for a moment. They had been kissing a few times in the past, but this time, she was asking him to be her escort and a friend. As they came to the front door, she unlocked it for him, opened the door, and he took me in. They were a couple. He was tall and lean. She was short and slim, and had long auburn hair. He was much taller and had longer hair.</p> <p>She sat me down on the sofa and leaned over to give me a quick kiss. She slid herself up onto the sofa with her legs over my lap, and the rest of her legs were on my chest.</p> <p>When he arrived with me, she gave me a kiss. "Would you like to go for a walk or go somewhere else?"</p> <p>"I would love to take a walk!"</p> <p>The next morning, after a quick coffee and croissant for breakfast, she said, "I feel much better. The last taxi was so bad I was having trouble walking. It's going to take a lot more time to get to my hotel."</p> <p>"How about lunch, after the conference tomorrow?" I suggested, as we were waiting for a taxi to arrive."</p> <p>He looked surprised again, but agreed in the end. After we ordered our meals and discussed our meetings with the organizers, he looked at me, a funny look on his face.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," he said, "I thought..."</p> <p>"Why do you think?" I said, "I don't know you, or would know you, but I didn't think you would agree to sit in on our conference if we got to it early and you won't get a hotel room."</p> <p>"I agree. In fact it's about as close as we'll get."</p> <p>"I'll make an executive decision in the morning on where we can get our rooms. We'll have the night to ourselves, and then decide on tomorrow. After that I have a lot of time to catch up with the next big issue I have to tackle. If you want to sit, please let me know."</p> <p>He nodded and said "I'd like that more than anything at all." We finished our meal and paid our cabby, and they left the room. She got dressed, put on a robe and said,</p> <p>"I love to cook," and they both looked surprised. It's hard to explain, but I'll come back for more detail later.</p> <p>During the conference dinner, he and I discussed some of the technical aspects of the program, and the importance of my decision. I agreed with him most of the time, and he was good to me, but at some point I would have to accept a job offer from the software company, or at least give it some thought.</p> <p>The next morning, I went off to work. I had just spent the last two weeks of the conference with several of my co-workers. We had the conference in the morning and were leaving before the afternoon session. She had been in the room for almost 45 minutes when she entered the room. She stopped in the hallway and smiled at me as she said,</p> <p>"You looked so tense yesterday. I was surprised. I just expected you to go with it, or to just give it your approval."</p> <p>"Your approval? Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?"</p> <p>"No, not kidding, just kidding," she answered, then said, "We'll see."</p> <p>At the end of my time in Atlanta, and while I had lunch in the hotel restaurant, I decided I had better get a shower and get down here before the conference had ended.</p> <p>I called my buddy, Jack. We were in the room at different times and Jack lived in Chicago. He was a software engineer for a very wealthy family. As he told me, he was a partner in the software company in Atlanta, and knew some interesting people.</p> <p>He told me they were both in Chicago visiting family members, so I told him about the conference and about the meeting with the organizers. Jack was very friendly, so I figured he was on board.</p> <p>The meeting was over at five, and I had to leave at eight.
