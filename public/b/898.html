"Thank you, Mom, it's been very good for me too. How long have you been at the gym?"</p> <p>"A couple of weeks. That's when my daughter was born."</p> <p>"And just as I've always been there for you, you're always there for me."</p> <p>"I feel like everyone will find me when I'm at home."</p> <p>"Well, my daughter hasn't been to the gym since yesterday, but I promise I will keep an eye on you and be there for you wherever you go from here."</p> <p>"Thanks, mom."</p> <p>As we walked to the door, I heard the click and lock sound of our door being closed. Then the soft door opening and closing again, leaving the one thing we were sure of: privacy and safety. It was an invitation with very little risk of being rejected. I could feel the warm wetness of my mother's pussy saturating my pants. I felt so proud to be with her. Our eyes never left the other as we walked down the drive and into the parking garage. We hadn't really even been there. I was sure she hadn't had much time to get ready for the visit.</p> <p>The large black Mercedes was still sitting in the driveway. There was no one in the garage, no one inside and no one else coming for her; she was safe from what would be happening later. "Oh, Mom, I'm so glad you're here. I just wish you could have stopped the car from going out and giving us the full treatment," I said kissing her on the cheek.</p> <p>"I'm here for you... and if you really want me to stop, then I'll stop the car; but I want you to know that I'll tell you when it's time." I felt a strange sense of comfort as she said that. I wanted to get to her, comfort her, let her know that everything was going to be okay. I think I still expected her to call and tell me of their impending separation.</p> <p>Mom and I stood looking at each other. "Thank you for caring about me, Mom."</p> <p>"Thank you, Mom." As she gave me an innocent hug, and I returned the hug with equal affection.</p> <p>We walked up the hall to our room, then stopped on my own. "You are a very special, special young lady, son," she said as she kissed me on the cheek.</p> <p>"Well, thank you, sweetheart, and everything is going to be okay again."</p> <p>Once we had entered the bedroom, I felt like a school kid again. As I turned her towards me, our lips touched. I felt so alive as she pressed her lips against mine. We didn't want to let go so we didn't. I kissed my mother and felt as I did, she was my first kiss. Not just by another man whose lips were touching hers, but by a woman who was kissing her. I felt the heat of our bodies together as we kissed. We weren't even really kissing as lovers, but I think by the time we came apart, we were sharing our intimate secret in our minds, our hearts, our soul.</p> <p>Finally I said, "I need to get some sleep, so please give me a few minutes."</p> <p>Mom gave me one of those smiles I couldn't believe, and said, "Okay, sweetie, I'll give you a few minutes and let you go to sleepâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
