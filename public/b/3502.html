I started.</p> <p>"So, why don't we just get some sleep and meet up tomorrow for an early flight?" she asked.</p> <p>"I'm sure we can do that," I replied.</p> <p>A few minutes later, my wife was curled up next to me in the king-size bed. "I need some sleep," she said as her hand gently caressed my cock.</p> <p>Her hand started to gently stroke up and down my cock as we drifted off, and I drifted off with her.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>A few hours later, I was awake. I heard the front door close and the sounds of her getting into bed next to me. I opened my eyes and immediately felt her mouth wrapped around my cock. She started slowly, first letting it slide down her throat, and then moving it up to her tongue. After a few minutes, she had me hard and ready. She slid off the bed and stood in front of me. I pulled her to me and kissed her deeply. She broke the kiss and stepped back. Her hand went to the front of her bikini, and began to massage her tits. I kissed her again, gently as I pulled the cloth away. I could feel her nipples becoming erect as I lowered my lips past her bellybutton and my mouth to her pussy.</p> <p>I felt her hand reach between her legs and touch my dick. She started stroking it slowly. "So, did that work?"</p> <p>"Oh, God yes," she replied. "I like having my pussy stroked, and I enjoy hearing the man moan too."</p> <p>"You like me sucking on it, don't you?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes," she said, her breathing becoming ragged, "but if we didn't...you know, do other things, why would that make it?"</p> <p>"To spice things up," I replied.</p> <p>I lowered her onto her back, and began kissing and licking her body from shoulders to her breasts. My hands went to her thighs and thighs, as I kissed down the middle. When I reached her pussy, I licked slowly and then began running my tongue up and down her pussy lips. I would kiss the sides and run it up to her clit, and then continue to use my tongue on her clit and pussy.</p> <p>"Oh, God, Michael. I want you now," she said, as I slowly lowered my pussy down on it.</p> <p>"I want you too. Let him do you," I could hear her groan.</p> <p>I could feel her hand begin to run down my arms. I kissed down to her naval, and then back up to her lips. I reached around and massaged her breasts and squeezed them softly. She grabbed my hair and pulled my lips down to her. I could taste her cum again and smell the aroma fill my nostrils.</p> <p>Her hands found my cock as she raised herself up, and her lips locked around the head of my dick. Slowly, she lowered her pussy down over the head of my dick. I could feel my cock entering and her lips sliding down her shaft. I could feel the warmth of her pussy on the head as it slid into her.</p> <p>"Ohhhhhhhh, ohhhhhhh, fuck!!!" I heard her scream when I bottomed out inside her.</p> <p>Her hips began rolling and her legs began to wrap around my body. She stopped and leaned back some, allowing me to work my dick in and out of her pussy.</p> <p>"Oh, God, Michael! That feels so fucking good. We should fuck!" she exclaimed, as she felt my cock start to pulsate inside her.</p> <p>"Fuck, I love seeing you spread out like that," I replied.</p> <p>"Yes, we should fuck," she replied.</p> <p>"Do you want me to pull out and fuck you, or would you like me to?" I asked</p> <p>"Don't cum until I tell you to," she responded.</p> <p>"Do what?" I asked.</p> <p>"Fuck me, but don't cum inside me," she said. "Besides, I want you to fuck me like I'd fuck you."</p> <p>"Ok. Whatever you want," I replied.</p> <p>Just before she reached out and wrapped her fingers around the shaft of my dick, she said, "Ok, I got it!"</p> <p>I could feel her pussy juice coating my cock as she slowly pulled her hand up and down.</p> <p>After a few minutes, she stopped, laid back on the bed andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
