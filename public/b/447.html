He wasn't the most attractive man, even for her when she didn't normally dress like that. And she liked the contrast of his rugged features against hers, which was something she preferred.</p> <p>But at the moment, he had this silly grin on his face, and after he sat down they were just the two of them laughing and joking about a game of chance.</p> <p>Then suddenly she had leaned back in her stool, hands over her lap, as if waiting for something, and, just like that, she was pulling his face down to hers for a kiss. It was a very intimate, intimate kiss, and this time it was different than the last, as it was completely uncharacteristic for her. She knew he would kiss her back, and she decided to reciprocate by lightly, and after an hour, they finally parted.</p> <p>That night when they finally were able to have some fun, this time, he held her in his arms a few times as they were making out.</p> <p>"No, make this last, baby," she whispered. "I want you to fuck me tonight, baby."</p> <p>"Mmm, we have an agreement here, baby." He replied, and he leaned in to kiss her again, but he pulled away and they were soon kissing again.</p> <p>And this time his tongue slipped in alongside hers instead, and they began to kiss hotly. As she ran her hand down his muscular body, from his chest, down his stomach, and then down his pants before he reached around to feel some of his own body, she wanted something else, but he wasn't responding with enough intensity in that department.</p> <p>"Mmm, yes," she said, "do to me what you do to me."</p> <p>His hand slid under her chin, and he raised her head and looked deep into her eyes.</p> <p>"You know, when I first saw you in the club, I wanted you as much as possible. I don't know if I'll ever get over it, baby. But..." Again he was kissing her, but this time their lips were only meeting briefly.</p> <p>"But it's okay, hon," she said, "I'm not going to be your girl any more."</p> <p>"It's okay, baby," was the only answer he got. With his answer however, she didn't pull back from him, and he felt that was the right thing to do as he was kissing her back so intensely. All the while they both knew they would one day be alone.</p> <p>"I'll always love you, hon," he said, then kissed her one last time, but then moved on, and they both knew there was a chance of that happening in a matter of weeksâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
