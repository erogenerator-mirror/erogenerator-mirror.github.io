My hands roamed over her body, feeling the texture of her skin, touching every part of her naked back. "Your hands feel so nice, Sam. Can you feel my hands all over?" she whispered. She held onto me so tightly, it was hard to breath, and my heart raced with the passion I'd been feeling for her for months. We laid close together, and she wrapped her legs around me and lifted up high for me. "Please fuck me," she pleaded. She opened her legs wide, and I pushed into her again. It was like a dream come true, the moment was real, and I knew it was time to start over.</p> <p>I fucked back, hard and fast. Her wetness was like fire. I felt my dick throb inside her, and we both came for a second time as I unloaded deep inside her warm pussy. I fell out of her and she rolled onto her back. I could feel her pussy contracting around my dick, and we moaned as we finished.</p> <p>She grabbed a tissue and wiped some of my semen out. "I got so fucking hot," she complained, "I was hoping it would only end there," she said. "My pussy's still in need of it," she added, still half on the sofa. I couldn't help but chuckle, as I lay next to her and closed my eyes. "How could you ever expect me to say no to your beautiful body?"</p> <p>"What makes you say that?" Sam asked. "Your legs are great, but you're so big. Can I do the work a little?"</p> <p>"Yes," I replied, "if you want to, I'm up by the time I get home."</p> <p>"I'd love to, I know I'll never be able to tell it's you that makes me that way," Sammy replied. "My body sure can use the exercise."</p> <p>I laughed. "I know."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Sam was so involved with my little story that she barely noticed where I was standing. She caught me watching her closely. I felt guilty, and she smiled at me knowingly. I started to walk down the hallway. "It was nice to see some of the city from the view of the road."</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm pretty high now," she said as she followed me.</p> <p>"I like it," I said, "especially that big house on the corner of the street, with the huge garden," I added, and I winked.</p> <p>Sam took in my hand and turned it down, which surprised me. She turned me with her other hand and our faces were almost touching. "Can we go back a while?" she asked, breaking the contact.</p> <p>"I guess so," I said. "I know I could use a nap."</p> <p>"Don't be silly," she said. "You're in no hurry to get that out of you. We can't do anything to stop when we get to the bedroom."</p> <p>A naked couple came up the hallway. I was surprised they had sex in a bedroom, though. Maybe they just wanted to fuck while Sam slept? I don't know. When I looked into their faces, I noticed a beautiful woman, who had to be a mom. I knew she wasn't as short as her daughter, even though she looked much younger. I started to notice the rest of the apartment.</p> <p>As they were all in the bedroom, I asked, "Who were you?"</p> <p>Sam sat up, her skirt riding up. "John, I don't remember your name, but I remember you," she replied.</p> <p>"Sam, Sam, please remember, we're not lovers." She laughed, but then looked at the others. "I'm a long time friend of Ed," she told them, "so we might as well get going, huh?" With that the others got dressed, and walked off into the living room.</p> <p>Sam looked at me, smiling. "John, I'm going to take off all my clothes, and I don't want to go that far with you here." As we got our clothes off, she sat back and said, "John, do you want to do it behind the door, or let me do it here?" I nodded my head. "Oh, John, are you going to fuck me while we're in the bedroom?" she asked again, giggling. I didn't know what to say. We got in the shower.</p> <p>She took me into her arms, and kissed me. We touched each other everywhere. I think she even liked to touch my dick, which was hard.
