I mean, the thought of you fucking me all night isn't something I ever want to consider."</p> <p>"How about you? I would love it."</p> <p>"Why? Does it bother you?"</p> <p>"That is up to you. I think your body is better than what some people can see."</p> <p>"My body? Do tell."</p> <p>"It's hard to describe the kind of person you are. I mean, you are young and so young. No, I would never think of fucking this guy for real, not that it's anything to write home about. I'm just glad I met you. I have no idea how to have sex with you without hurting you. Maybe, if you would help me, I could try for a threesome, for example."</p> <p>"You are something else, too, Bill. You are sexy. I will help you be sexier and I'm willing to help out and I'm just glad I met you. What do you say for me?</p> <p>"Good-bye. I won't be seeing you again if I can help it."</p> <p>"Thanks. We have so much to discuss."</p> <p>We finished the bottle of wine. After the meal, I went to the bathroom to clean up. I returned, wrapped in a towel, with a smile on my face, and I walked off the patio to the pool. I was about to jump into the water when I stopped.</p> <p>"Whoa!" I said. "Don't worry about that. You're not going to hurt yourself."</p> <p>"Oh, yeah. I didn't know about that." I turned around and began swimming. I was beginning to feel uncomfortable. I wanted to go out back.</p> <p>"No, not with you. Maybe we can have a few drinks before we head back. I don't feel comfortable talking to you like that."</p> <p>"You are a wonderful conversationalist, Bill. You're an excellent conversationalist."</p> <p>"I know. I have a lot to thank you for."</p> <p>"Well, thank you. I thought the night was over."</p> <p>"I didn't see you come out there."</p> <p>"You could say that, but I don't think that's what I meant by it. I'll just go to the house."</p> <p>"I'll see you in the pool later."</p> <p>"Yes-bye, Bill."</p> <p>After I got down to the pool, I had a really nice buzz going. Maybe I could get some ideas to spice up what we had done. I did, however, notice that I was doing something different. I was feeling pretty good in the pool. I could feel an incredible buzz getting into me. My cock was starting to get hard. I thought I could feel it throb in my hand. If I could feel that hard cock for just a few seconds, it would be the biggest boner I've even ever had! It felt just like my wife's.</p> <p>About half an hour later, I was feeling much better. I was thinking about what I wanted to do for a new job. This was a great opportunity for me.</p> <p>"That was a great idea. You did that all right, Bill," I said.
