I said gently.</p> <p>"No! You don't really think I've done nothing?" she said, sitting up and turning to the one with a smirk in her eyes. She took my hand and brought me over to her. "Are you sure this is something you think would help us in our quest?"</p> <p>"Oh, don't make me stop." I moved my lips toward hers and she pulled away from me with an expression of disgust. "Now go, you're late and I'm no longer your friend."</p> <p>"But you know I'm not going to let you leave me," she said as if she was talking about something else. I put my arms around her and she put a hand over mine and gave it a squeeze. We stopped by my desk and she pulled me into an embrace. I felt her ample breasts pressing against my chest and her soft belly, and as our lips kissed I slipped my hand up her skirt and into her panties.</p> <p>"No!" she said and wriggled away from me as I pulled away. But she was still moving away anyway, letting go of my arms, her eyes flashing in anger. "Get on with it girl," she said. "The other's got another appointment."</p> <p>"I wouldn't do that," I said. "Besides, I'm working!"</p> <p>"You're so lazy!"</p> <p>"You can take care of your own needs too," I said. "It's going to be just you and me, remember?"</p> <p>"Oh, this can't happen again!" she said and got out of the bed. "And I don't want us to have any future plans. Especially one that I'll never get back to. There's a lot of pain over the last few years."</p> <p>"Well that's exactly how I feel..." I took her hand and gently led her down the hall while she got dressed in my bedroom.</p> <p>I was glad she wasn't at her office so I could wait there so we could talk. It was early morning when I got home and as usual I had to hurry. When I got there, I sat down to a cold beer. I was just finishing the last one when it rang.</p> <p>"Hello?"</p> <p>"In here!" a male voice said.</p> <p>I went over to answer the call.</p> <p>"Hi, it's me, Mr. Anderson. I thought you'd call."</p> <p>"It's Sam. I'm sorry...it's really hard to call you that when my boss called last night."</p> <p>"Yeah, I know. I don't like it," I answered with a big smile. "That's kind of the point. I don't expect you to feel comfortable to talk about this without me around. You know..."</p> <p>"So, I'm sorry!"</p> <p>"I know, Sam."</p> <p>"I just thought you should know I'm not at work and I'm free for two whole days."</p> <p>"So, can you come over for dinner? I'd love to."</p> <p>"I can't. It's just that this whole thing, you know," he went on.</p> <p>"Well, maybe it's in the off chance we'll make it happen," I said.</p> <p>"Don't worry. I do what I can for the both of us." He looked at me for a minute, then he shook his head. "It's just that I've got to have dinner with someone and then I'm off," he said and got back into his chair.</p> <p>It was nice. A nice dinner, a lovely bottle of wine and conversation. Then when we'd finished, he asked, "And so, what makes you suppose I'd do a favor for a friend of mine?"</p> <p>I laughed. "I could have you do that too. I can't think of anyone I'd feel more fortunate than you to be one-on-one with a guy."</p> <p>"No, no! You're right. I'm sorry, actually. I just don't think that this will all work out right."</p> <p>"Well, I don't want to be a burden on you, Sam."</p> <p>"Yeah," he said.</p> <p>I sat there thinking about what I would do with this friendship. It would have to be a two-person fling, something that could develop into something more. Like a "goodbye fuck." Or, a "just sex" as he put it. I think about what it would be like to see him, kissing and taking his clothes offâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
