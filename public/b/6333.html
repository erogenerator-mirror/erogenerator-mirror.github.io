He got into the car and backed out the driveway while she walked from the door to her house.</p> <p>He didn't have to look back, he knew exactly where they were going.</p> <p>~*~*~*~</p> <p>~*~*~*~</p> <p>She stood in front of the mirror, her heart beating wildly in her chest. She knew that she was a mess. All he had to do was walk by and she'd be naked and he'd take her to sex again. He was her best man. And he was going to make love to HER one last time. She closed her eyes and looked to her face as the mirror's light flashed down over the smooth curves of her face. The mirror reflected her emotions: fear, apprehension and desire. She couldn't remember everything. She knew that every man who walked by her house at night would be thinking of the sight he'd just witnessed. And she'd feel like she had been branded by his eyes.</p> <p>~*~*~*~</p> <p>Just before it was over, he drove quickly to her house, pulled the car off and drove her home. She had a hard time thinking. She couldn't say a word. He pulled into the driveway, got out and grabbed her keys from the counter as she came to stand at the door. He looked at her as she approached carrying the keys and he dropped the keys beside the door. The tension grew and grew again. He looked at her with his dark eyes. She could barely make out his face as the door opened and there he was, towering above her, his dark hair hanging loose behind his back, he wasn't going to be able to take his eyes off her.</p> <p>Without saying a word, without saying anything he walked backwards and took her hand, bringing her into the house. She walked with him as he led her to the large comfortable couch in the foyer, sitting her down. He moved so that he could take off his shoes and shoes and placed them beside her. He sat down next to her and leaned her against his chest, he looked over her shoulder to see her staring into his eyes. He could see her fear and uncertainty. He wanted to hold her, to pull her down to him, but he couldn't. They talked and laughed as they spoke. A smile crossed his face, his hand gently running over her face as they touched.</p> <p>He leaned in, his breath warm against her neck as he put his lips to hers. As his warm lips pressed against hers, he felt her lips part at the tip of his tongue, feeling the warmth of it slide across his lips, as his touch slid down his tongue before it returned once more. Slowly, his gentle kisses moved over her lips, his tongue licking her lips, her tongue licking them. Their hands slowly moved to each other's cheeks. She felt his hard chest against her breasts, and when his hand slid down her stomach, she leaned her back forward and he pressed himself against her. Their kisses continued. He felt his hard member press against her wet panties, as their mouths met and he felt her hand move to wrap around his. She pulled him into her, their bodies pressed tightly together.</p> <p>He lifted her chin up to look at him as he slid two fingers inside her pussy. She moaned loudly as he slid them inside her. "You're so wet, so wet." he said.</p> <p>She didn't answer. He moved his kisses over her neck again and started kissing his way to her ear. He could feel her shudder. "You want me to fuck you?" He whispered in her ear.</p> <p>"Yes." She said.</p> <p>With the other hand, he rubbed his shaft against her crotch, feeling her breathing deepen as she moaned. He kissed his way up her neck, and he felt her lips part to take his mouth. As he slid his lips down her shoulder, he felt her hand tighten along his hardness.</p> <p>With one hand, she opened her mouth and his tongue pressed against her lips. He moaned, his mouth moving toward hers. She opened her mouth to let him take control. As his hands slid up her body, he caressed her breasts, pushing the softness of the soft, warm, soft skin of her breast. His hard cock pressed against her as it slid down her stomach.</p> <p>The feel of her soft flesh had his mouth on hers, his touch like the softest kisses, as they met, as they moved together. He could feel the slight burn of her body as he pressed against her, the tautness of her belly and breasts as he slid down further down her bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
