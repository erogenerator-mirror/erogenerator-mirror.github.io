I knew, but I couldn't seem to say it all. The car rolled faster, the wind howling through the windshield. I turned so that my leg was in my lap as Jim was driving down the road. He looked at me and said, "You've gotta be tired."</p> <p>I said, "It looks alright, but I need to go." He looked back across the road toward the house. "Don't go."</p> <p>I reached behind me and untied the halter letting my body fall forward until my head was dangling between my arms where my hair floated around my neck. I turned around and kissed him. I then reached my hands down my sides and pulled my shorts and panties off while his eyes were glued to me. Without a word, I pulled the shorts and underwear off and laid there letting him watch me.</p> <p>When he was satisfied that he had all that he needed to watch and wanted only to see me naked, he stood up and put his jeans and undershorts on and walked into the house, leaving me sitting there waiting for him to return.</p> <p>I watched him as he moved around the house. When he came back, he walked to the front of his car and opened it. I heard the car door open and closed. He came inside and closed it as he went around front and pulled his jeans up and over the shoes. As he exited the car, he reached for his shirt buttons and said, "You're sure not all that tired?"</p> <p>He went around back to my door but I could feel the heat radiating from him. His shirt came up and we kissed slowly and passionately just one more second. When he stepped back and turned to look at me, I quickly dropped the shirt over my head and pulled my top off slowly, slowly taking each inch of skin with it until it hung over my bra. I could feel his hands running over my breasts as he knelt to unclasp my bra.</p> <p>He pulled the straps down my shoulders, undid the clasps and said, "Don't be so nervous, "I've seen everything you've got, you got it, I have." I said with a smile as he gently started working on my breast. I reached down and started to unbutton his shirt. He looked down at me as he reached down and slowly pulled the shirt off and let the shirt fall to the floor. His eyes never left my body as he let the shirt fall to the floor as well. He had a look in his eyes as he looked at my body, a look of wonderment as he looked at my breast and saw what he had seen.</p> <p>I reached behind me for my shirt and he helped me get it off the floor in one fluid motion. I kicked the sandal off the foot of the couch and let it slowly slip off as he followed with the shirt. He took my hand and lifted it so that it dropped to the floor as well and then he slowly took my hand and put it on his shoulder. He stepped closer to me and moved my hand slowly up his body, down his torso as he moved back to my side.</p> <p>When he was kneeling, he leaned forward and put his face between my breasts and he slowly, gently kissed each nipple, not with any real tongue action, but just the lightest of kisses with his lips and teeth. He moved his lips up and down my body, kissing, licking and sucking as he moved toward my neck.</p> <p>He stopped long enough to put the tip of his tongue down there and play around for a moment. I felt a tremor run through me, this was what I had been waiting for and I had wanted this for the longest time. Jim's cock was standing out like a flagpole from the front of his jeans and I took it in my hands as I continued to kiss his neck and his shoulders.</p> <p>Slowly, he moved his hands up to my jeans and undid them while he took my breast out of my bra which he quickly moved back down to my body so that he could have easy access to what I longed to feel. As he lowered himself again, I pulled downward on his pants and slowly, almost reluctantly, pulled at them. As they came off his legs, I pulled more of his pants off to join the shirt. I lay back on the floor and took off his pants as one hand held the shirt together on his thighs and the other went up and down his thigh.</p> <p>He watched me as he slid his leg up and down my bare leg several more times before he stood up and moved to put the pants in the top dresser drawer. I had to do a mental double take as we were standing there together in only our underwear. I had never been with two guys at the same time, but it had always felt so intense when Jim and Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
