He then turned and headed downstairs to the kitchen to make himself a drink, when he'd heard the shower turn off. When she emerged from the bathroom, she looked as scrumptious as ever, dressed in her sexy blue silk nightgown, holding her hand over the towel rack to her body. He couldn't help but admire the way her legs tapered so seductively to her shapely ass. Her nipples hardened noticeably beneath the thin fabric as she dried away several strands of her hair.</p> <p>"I'm not gonna try to hide it!" she chuckled as she wrapped the towel back around her body and turned to head to the kitchen to make herself one too.</p> <p>Jack laughed as he watched as she walked gracefully and purposefully, her sexy ass swaying beneath the silky fabric. He couldn't wait to feel it against his cock, and to make love to her sweet juicy cunt, while she gave him some very hot and steamy blowjob.</p> <p>***</p> <p>In the kitchenette chair across from the coffee pot, Jack watched as Ashley moved around the room lighting candles, which she proceeded to do until she was completely lit. When some of the luster was gone, she sat down in one of the matching chairs and spread her legs, giving Jack the perfect opportunity to feast his eyes on her succulent pussy.</p> <p>He moved toward her when she started to pull the nightie up higher; his eyes locked with hers as she lifted it to reveal the creamy skin of her thighs and the top of her beautiful ass, barely covered by the tiny purple panties.</p> <p>"Would you like to touch my pussy, Jack!" she cooed while raising her hips to pull the panties up to her waist. He was almost taken by surprise when she slipped her legs off the chair allowing him full access to her pussy. She smiled at him seductively as his hands reached for her pussy, gliding over her smooth pussy lips and into her panties. When her panties were finally off, she handed them to him, and he stepped back, giving them to her. She gave him a mischievous grin and pulled them again over her wet and hungry pussy, the silky material parting to reveal her gorgeous pink labia.</p> <p>"That was just what I wanted," she giggled again as she pulled the panties down, revealing her sexy crotch. "Did you get anything else?" she asked him.</p> <p>"Not really; just the nightie, this time," he said, grinning.</p> <p>"Yes, please, as I'm wearing nothing beneath it," she begged as she sat up as high as she could and turned so that she could slide out of the sheer bra. They both laughed as he sat on the chair, pulling her to him.</p> <p>"Let me finish making you a drink," she said.</p> <p>He reached for the cupboard again and pulled out a fresh bottle of rum, his eyes roaming over her body once before he leaned forward and kissed the bottom of her sexy nipple.</p> <p>"I'm glad you like this," he whispered softly, and then kissed his way down between her legs.</p> <p>"Mmm," she purred as he kissed her crotch, his tongue running lightly over her lips. Her hands grasped his neck, pulling him closer, his cock rock hard in his pajama pants.</p> <p>"I'll be right back," she smiled, and got off the chair when she heard the door open and close in the doorway. She felt hot from the heat of the hot tub and her pussy tingled as she imagined that it was him kneeling between her legs sucking her cunt...</p> <p>His eyes fixed on Ashley as she walked toward the door, her body glistening with beads of sweat, and a hint of excitement in her voice. She stood on the other side of the room a while longer, watching him eat her pussy; her nipples growing hard as he did so. Her head tossed back in pleasure as he kissed lightly, taking time to lick and suck the wet lips of her pussy and clit. He moved to slip his hand between her legs and she spread for him, as he slipped one finger inside of her; her reaction so close and intense that she thought it would send him flying. His fingers moved faster.</p> <p>"Oh yes, Jack... yes," she moaned as he fingered her, bringingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
