Your brown-blonde hair falls down right in front of your shoulders. Dark blue eyes sparkle with mischief, your cute nose. You look absolutely ravishing.</p> <p>Your skirt sits a couple inches above your knees. It's very short, and I find it's quite uncomfortable. I take note of your pale skin, and the way it shines from the sun. I see the small marks from previous visits to your room, and it's hard to believe that someone didn't do it before.</p> <p>My stomach drops at the thought of going through this. No sooner do I start this conversation then the waiter's arrival, and a moment later your smile, her beautiful eyes, and a hint of a smirk flash across your lips. Your legs move slightly apart, and your legs seem to take on an air of command... like the command your pussy provides as you walk. Your feet start to uncurl as your hips are now turned ever so slightly. "I'm ready, my dear," your voice says. I can almost feel your heart pounding. "Just a moment," you say, and walk over to the bar and order yourself a drink. You glance back at me, as she follows behind you. "I'll get it," you say, as a quick smile on your lips. She returns with your drink as the waiter turns to leave.</p> <p>"I have a good time tonight, and I will see you tomorrow morning," you say as the waiter sits your drink down, and heads out.</p> <p>"And I hope we can play a little," your next words start to fade into the sound of my heart.</p> <p>"And maybe go a little further," my voice starts to fade too as suddenly as it arrived. I know this is the one thing that I haven't felt in a long time. Having an audience with you. The way her eyes are looking at you. The way her breathing is hard and heavy. And the way her soft lips are moving... oh... so much sexier, but so... so... so... not me...</p> <p>"Well?... I didn't know.... You have to give me a kiss..."</p> <p>You turn your head to me. I don't know what to do. I stand up, and my heart is pounding harder as I stand in front of you. You look at me, and you look a little nervous. "I don't even know what to do for a kiss," you say hesitantly.</p> <p>I pull your face closer to mine and kiss you ever so lightly on the lips. You look at me, as my lips kiss you more fully than ever before. Your lips open, and I slowly slide them in and out of your soft lips. I kiss you so deeply, and your face tenses against mine. Your lips come together as I kiss you again. You press your firm body against me, as our lips come together for the first time. I feel your breasts against me, and my hands move to your hips. I can feel your hard nipples pressing against my chest. Your breathing is heavier, and we can hear you softly sighing. Your body is warm and wonderful against me. I slip my hand into your long dress, and feel your hand slip beneath the hem of your dress. I cup both breasts, and feel the nipples tighten against the palm of my hand.</p> <p>"My God," I think to myself. "I've never done it like this before... never...." I'm so nervous, and excited by the thought though, and the sensations that I'm experiencing, that the whole thing is unreal. Slowly but surely, slowly, I begin to kiss your lips. Your breath is hot and moist against my lips. I kiss you again, and feel your lips part against mine. I press my tongue into the opening of your mouth, and it's very warm and slightly wet. Our tongues swirl against each other for a moment. "God, this is so wrong," I think to myself. I feel your lips press against mine as my own mouth meets yours. We begin to kiss passionately, and both of us can feel the electricity course through our bodies. Your breast rub against my body, rubbing against me. Your tongue plays with mine, and we can both feel the moistness of each other. Softly, tenderly, your kiss becomes more and more passionate and urgent and more passionate. Your kissing turns more feverishly heated, as we both feel the electricity between us. I move my hands behind you, and slide my body against yours before I lift you onto the edge of the table. Your body sits on top of mine as we kiss with an intensity that I've never felt before, and I can see your eyes shut slightly as I kiss you harder and harder.</p> <p>I feel your breath coming faster against my lips. I feel you pressing against me harder. Her tongue slips into my mouthâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
