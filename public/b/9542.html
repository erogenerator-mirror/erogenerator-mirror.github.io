She ran her hands through his long hair, over his skin, until they were rubbing gently against the bulging muscles in his shoulders and chest. He sighed and leaned more towards her, their lips meeting, and he pressed her breasts against the bed. Their bodies mashed together, as she opened up and rubbed her hot pussy against his hard cock. Then he rolled them over and took her body from side to side as they kissed. They moved in rhythm as their bodies moved and bucked together.</p> <p>He took her hands and placed them on his strong shoulders. They could not move as their bodies moved together, their tongues exploring each other's mouths. He knew she would make him cum soon. She kissed down along his neck, across his chest on the way to his lips. He opened his mouth slightly and his tongue slipped into hers. It tasted so good. He knew it was wrong but she didn't care. He moved his hand down her back and caressed the soft cheeks. He heard an urgent sound of her moans and stopped kissing her to run his tongue round her mouth, sucking and feeling, then feeling the hardness of his tongue. He felt her press against his cock again and moaned into her mouth as his hand found its way beneath her nightdress.</p> <p>They began to kiss passionately, but with one final thrust and a cry of satisfaction, he pulled away. Their lips were almost touching, and when he looked at her face he found her eyes locked and staring into him with a small smile on her lips. She lay back on the bed on her back, panting, and he lay down between her legs. She began to arch her back and he gently lifted the hem of her nightdress gently. He stared for a moment at the pink, moist, silk on the inside. He felt excited as he pulled lightly at her panties and she lifted herself slightly to help him take them off of her. When he raised her naked leg he kissed the inside of her thigh as it was pushed up by the back of the panties. There's that spot, somewhere his lips go, just right. He kissed and licked her soft flesh, feeling it jump when he touched it. He heard her gasp and saw her lift herself a little.</p> <p>He lifted the nightdress off her body and felt for the first time that he was seeing the very flesh beneath her nightdress. He pushed his face into her hot, soft and soft, wet. He was amazed at how she tasted. He heard her gasp again and again as her body continued to shake from her impending orgasm. He ran his tongue slowly around his tongue, tasting each spot as each breath escaped. He began to suck her outer lips as she trembled and began to move her hips ever so slightly. She held his head hard as he sucked on her. He felt her cumming and her whole body quaked and he was amazed that his cock could go as rigid as it was. He began to work the shaft of his cock with his hand, slowly running it up and down in small circles, feeling her cumming on the way and watching her shudder and arch under his touch again and again.</p> <p>She looked up at him and smiled at him. "Are you ready for some love?"</p> <p>She raised herself slightly to him and he sat back on his knees. "I can't wait," he said. She lifted her legs to him and he began to kiss the inside of her thigh as he rubbed his face against her soaking pussy. He spread her outer lips with his middle finger and rubbed his tongue into her. She tasted salty and sweet, so different from the taste he had been tasting many times before. He was in heaven and she was screaming his name again. His tongue, his lips and his fingers worked her slowly and lovingly, his tongue working her everywhere it could reach. She began to hump his mouth, pressing and guiding his face into her and moaning with each breath. As she came, she pushed his head away from her pussy, lifting herself to her feet and turning on the bed and rolling over on her stomach. He saw her hair moving up and down the bed as she slowly and carefully rolled to her back and lay there with her legs parted. Her nightshirt felt as if it had been tied in a knot in the middle of her back.</p> <p>She saw that he lay on his back between her legs with his prick standing erect. She looked at him and smiled. He pulled her panties the rest of the way off and her knees rose and fell. She was on her back now, so he lifted her legs slightly and began to kiss the inside. "If you want this to stop it doesn't stop now," she said. He looked up at her and took his prick in his hand. She raised her bum and he positioned himself for entry. They both moaned as it slid in easily for their first time. "You're so good, you make me so wetâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
