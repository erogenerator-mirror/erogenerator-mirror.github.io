Sarah said, not offended, more amused than offended perhaps, or at least that is what I thought.</p> <p>"I thought he was supposed to be my boyfriend." Emily said</p> <p>"Yeah, I know, I'm sorry that I never told you." I said, glad to hear that Emily had changed her feelings about me, but at least not to anyone else, maybe I could have been different from the other guys that we knew, and I felt bad that she had to worry with someone else.</p> <p>"Don't you find me attractive?" She said, still playing on the edge, smiling a little at the double entendre in her words.</p> <p>"Ya, I do. How do you mean?" I replied, I hadn't realised, but I realised that if she wasn't a virgin she probably could have been, but if she was, she could always have gone.</p> <p>Emily and I stared at each other for a moment and I had to be quiet, I'm sure I saw tears form in her eyes as she was about the turn of events. Not that she needed to be reminded of what happened when she took my virginity, she was the next to the next to the next, but I couldn't help being in love with her. We were both on cloud nine and we made it.</p> <p>"I don't want you to regret it Emily." I said, brushing a strand of her hair back and away from her face.</p> <p>"I'm sure I will." She said, breaking the tense silence and looking back at me again, my hands now resting on her shoulders. "And you can just get dressed if you want."</p> <p>"Oh no, I'm not that desperate for someone else." I said, taking a step backwards, Emily and I still face to face.</p> <p>"Right, I need a bath then. I'm out of the shower for an hour, I'll be out in a bit, I'll be going out later, just grab something to wear if you'll be back." Emily said, starting to walk down the stairs.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I asked, still stunned at what our friend had just suggested.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm sure, you just grab your stuff, I'll take care of it." Emily added, as I watched her naked bum disappear into the stairs, she turned her head and smiled at me. "Don't wait up for me."</p> <p>I headed home, after telling my mum about Emily and I going to stay the night and I went to bed. I knew that I wouldn't be thinking of Emily that night, nor would I even touch her, so I just drifted off to sleep thinking of her.</p> <p>I woke up bright and early in the morning, after showering and dressing, sitting in the lounge looking through the cupboards looking for my underwear. Emily was in the kitchen, she looked fantastic, wearing just a red satin teddy and matching black bra, and a pair of black high heels. "Good morning." I said, sitting down at the table in front of her.</p> <p>"Hi." She said, sitting down opposite me.</p> <p>"Hello, have a nice breakfast?" I asked</p> <p>"Thank you."</p> <p>"Good coffee if you're lucky." I said, leaning back in my chair and crossing my legs.</p> <p>"No, I'm not." Emily said, with a small smile.</p> <p>"Do you want coffee then?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes please."</p> <p>I finished my coffee and placed it down in front of her. Emily got up and grabbed a paper cup, she then turned around and set to breakfast, a few minutes later, she sat back and put her paper in front of her again. "I didn't mean anything by it, but it's all of its own."</p> <p>I finished my coffee and poured myself another one. We sat together for a while until my mum started asking questions. "So are you staying the weekend at my friend's in Bristol?" she asked, interrupting my thoughts as she asked the question.</p> <p>"Yes." I said, trying to be helpful.</p> <p>"I'm sorry." She started then added. "You don't know her." she said, before I said. "It's a bit difficult now, but yes, yes I'm staying in Bristol." she added, as I could tell she was shocked.</p> <p>"So do you want to move at some point?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Do you want me to move?" She said, not taking her eyes away from mine.</p> <p>"No, it's hard to say. It might take a while to get used to. I have nowhere to go and just my bed is not big enough to accommodate all my stuff."
