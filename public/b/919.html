It was as though they were all in their element to the point that it became unnecessary for them to hide their presence. At any rate, it was as if there was something not right in this situation. The more this girl's mind was engaged, the more she started to feel more aroused by a very male body. To be fair, this thought had nothing to do with any particular sex. The arousal was quite the opposite. Instead, it started when she was looking at the ceiling in a mirror. This was it. Now she did know what she wanted to do tonight. She turned her head and found her mouth suddenly dry as well as a bit of her breath. She pulled herself from the wall, standing up with her back against the wall with her hand on the wall and her legs spread slightly. She reached her hands around so they could pull her ass cheeks apart.</p> <p>She looked into the mirror and saw herself getting fucked from behind. It was quite an erotic sight, her round ass stretched over the cool wall, her cheeks held together, then pushed outwards by her fingers as she took it. Even her fingers were moist, her body slick with her own juices. She looked at herself in the mirror, seeing every man she knew in the reflection, but didn't recognize him or her. Even her nipples, which were swollen and engorged, were clearly visible through the thin material of the shirt she was wearing.</p> <p>In the mirror, she saw her face looking back at her as she did it, saw her long blonde hair falling down around her round shoulders, her cheeks pressed together and held by her arms over them by clasping the white material that she was wearing in her hands. She stared at herself, at this object of her passion, at her own breasts. She felt herself getting incredibly aroused as the sight of herself went on, felt her nipples begin to harden under her fingers as she fingered herself. She closed her eyes to the sight of it and her own hands began to move against her body, her own fingers sliding easily over her own smooth skin in a circular motion over her breasts until she found her clitoris and began to rub it. With her eyes still closed, she heard herself making little noises of pleasure, more and louder and louder as the sensations of her fingers and mind built.</p> <p>With her eyes closed, she felt her back arch towards the wall as it suddenly went still. She felt her whole body shake as her knees gave out in her knees and she leaned against the wall with her head resting on the marble. As her mind finally turned to the image in the glass, it suddenly came to her. To think, of all the people who had seen her before. The fact that others who had seen hers had seen them while walking around her. The sight of herself, naked and vulnerable, lying there, her ass stuck out, her breasts jiggling, her legs spread and her face contorted into a look that she had never seen before in her life.</p> <p>Still looking at herself in the mirror, she felt herself get wet. Her body started to feel hot, so hot and it felt to her like it had been cold. She could see her body still moving against her own as she rubbed her clitoris. Her whole body shook as she came, she felt her mouth drop open as she let herself out of the glass, but her eyes were still closed. The moment she had been in, the moment she had enjoyed, the moment she had looked through, the whole scene was just about to give her an orgasm. She just felt it, her vagina spasmed and squeezed itself against itself, she could feel herself and her body shuddered, like a wave of pleasure, coming over her body in waves. She heard herself moan softly, as the orgasm that had overtaken her, the feeling of the waves of pleasure washing over her and into her mind and soul, she felt herself cumming, one last wave of orgasmic pleasure sweeping through her. She felt the juices starting to flow out of herself, onto the carpet, she felt herself start to shake, as though possessed by it, as her body was possessed as well, it was the most powerful orgasm she had ever experienced when it was this way.</p> <p>When her orgasm ended, a fresh wave washed over her and she slumped against the wall as she lay there, trying to catch her breath. She felt herself being let go, she was completely exhausted and she felt herself slowly going back to the reality of her situation. As she let herself regain her bearings, she turned to see how she was doing. She had a look of utter contentment on her face.</p> <p>She was in the mirror again, looking back at herself and then she saw that the mirror was no longer there, though the hand she had been holding herself against a wall of glass had stayed up, the other hand had dropped down to her breasts, squeezing and rubbing themâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
