So, I slowly pulled her body up to mine and felt her lips press gently on my lips in return. I was about to kiss her again when we both stopped and looked at each other.</p> <p>“What does it take for us to stay like this,” we both asked each with almost equal ease.</p> <p>“I’m not sure, but I don’t want a one night stand like we have always made love, now is the time to make love,” she answered, “We can’t have a second chance any time soon.”</p> <p>While we talked we stroked and petted each other, as I had in the past. But, today, we wanted to make one last time of it.</p> <p>“Let’s go to the bed and make love,” she whispered, “I don’t know what I like better.”</p> <p>“Come on,” I pulled her to the side of the tub, “don’t worry. I’ll do anything for you.”</p> <p>I stripped, jumped into the tub and she climbed in next to me. We climbed under the warm water and I took her nipples in my hands, then massaged them in front of my face.</p> <p>“Oh, that feels so good.” she moaned between her kisses.</p> <p>So did I. We were both horny as a pair, and she wanted to make love now. She rolled onto her back and I rolled onto my side over her. I took her in my arms and moved so I could kiss her long and hard. She returned the favor by kissing and nibbling on my nipples, which brought all of my attention back to her.</p> <p>She broke away from my chest and sat with one leg up on the ledge in the tub. Her body was beautiful, as my eyes were all over it. Her legs were spread apart and my cock was pressed to her pussy. She had the look of a woman possessed; like she’s dreaming, while my eyes traveled from her eyes to her body. Seeing her nude body was a turn on and I could hardly wait until our evening was complete. She was going to take us to the heights of ecstasy and make us both crazy as we made love. But, today, we had to be sure, and go slowly.</p> <p>I reached down her body and felt her breasts. It was a great turn on; to be able to play with her errant nipples.</p> <p>“Oh, God,” she groaned as if she’d heard it, “that feels so good,” she said with her voice trailing off. I couldn’t believe that I was making love to this lovely young woman, her body was so close, it was almost touching me.</p> <p>But I didn’t move. Her eyes were closed, but her lips were open and my face was near hers.</p> <p>“This is what you want now, isn’t it,” she breathed to me.</p> <p>I nodded and moved down her body. Her breasts made my mouth water and I made the most of it. I took the nipples gently between my fingers and rolled them. She groaned loudly and then moaned again when I put another hand flat on her abdomen and began to move downward. I could feel the softness of her pubic hair and marveled at the beauty of the mounds of flesh that rested on them. I loved it, I loved those little bumps. When the mounds were swollen and her inner lips were parted I saw her slit. Her flesh was like a flower. I kissed one as each breast became firm and felt her hardening nipple press into the palm of my hand. I could feel her arousal and desire for me. I was on fire with lust as I kissed downward.</p> <p>Her pussy was open and inviting, and I leaned down between her legs and kissed her slit again. Then, I moved one of my fingers down to her opening and traced it around the outside of her lips until I found the opening. She responded strongly to my attention to her pussy as I slid my finger down and up her opening, sliding it through her opening on each pass. Our kisses became more intense and our hands were everywhere caressing, touching, loving, and exploring each other. Her eyes were closed and I could see her face and throat and face. We held each other, like animals, kissing and exploring, savouring every moment. I moved her legs and she moved up so I could kiss her there—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
