I know it shouldn't feel like that, but, I hope it's all right. He's so handsome. I like it when he smiles. Did you kiss him?"</p> <p>He chuckled and said, "Yes. It's nice for me to talk to you again while you're here in a real sense, and I hope it's all right too."</p> <p>He reached down and grabbed my hair and he kissed me passionately. I was so wet. My skin was so alive and so different from all the other people's. Our tongues intertwined and danced on the others lips. I could feel myself wanting to feel him inside me. Just as soon as we arrived, I could feel him pulling the gown from my shoulders. I felt him slide my gown off my body as he lay on top of me.</p> <p>"What have you gotten me?" I said.</p> <p>He reached down and lifted my legs so he could pull the gown completely over my head.</p> <p>"You will be here all day tomorrow, and you will do exactly as I tell you, and you will even like it!"</p> <p>He was a little scared to tell me the whole truth. He didn't want to scare me too, but he didn't want to do it by himself either. His arms were around me and as he laid me down, he slipped his fingers inside the front of my panties. His fingers slid around the edge of my pussy and he slowly and gently teased me. The entire time he was slowly teasing me, he told me how beautiful I was, how sexy I was and how much he wanted to please his new fiancée.</p> <p>"I see..." I thought to myself.</p> <p>He slipped a finger inside me and ran his finger down to the base of my pussy before slipping back up to circle my clit. He continued fingering me until I was on the edge of an orgasm. I wanted him to give me the pleasure I desperately needed before I went insane with longing. So, just as he'd done to her, he slid his finger in my pussy and began to pump it in and out. His other hand was busy playing with my nipples, and I could feel his cock pressing against my leg as he continued to finger fuck my pussy.</p> <p>"Come on!" I cried. I needed it so badly. The moment I was near, he slipped a finger inside my ass. "Oh yes! Yes!" I cried as I orgasmed uncontrollably. My body shuddered, and my thighs were so wet his finger slid easily inside me as my pussy spasmed around it. I felt so happy to have let the whole world know I had found someone to love and loved them all of my life.</p> <p>"I know you really love me!" he said to me as we lay side-by-side—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
