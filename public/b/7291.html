He's gonna fucking go fucking bananas when he sees this!" I hissed.</p> <p>"Ha. Yeah, definitely," she giggled.</p> <p>After we finally returned our clothes out of the bedroom, we sat on the couch and did a very quick wash-up. I was amazed by how sexy she got and what she said. She started with, "So, what did you do tonight?"</p> <p>"It was nothing special. It was just you and me."</p> <p>"Oh, my God, you're making me hot," she laughed and then leaned over and started to slowly kiss me. Her lips were very soft and her lips were soft and her tongue was very warm. If I had a choice, I would have been turned on and I know it. This was going to be as good as a night of sex.</p> <p>As her kiss ended she whispered into my ear, "So, what did you expect to accomplish with your little game tonight?" "Well, when I got back into the house I was surprised to see what was going on in their room!" I told her.</p> <p>"I couldn't have imagined!"</p> <p>We both sat there looking at each other, waiting anxiously for the next steps. This was going to be very interesting!</p> <p>"And?" I asked</p> <p>"I told you, this place is going to be fun!" she answered, squeezing my hand, "And I just might even let my dad have the first go on my first night here!"</p> <p>"How would your father feel about it?"</p> <p>"I dunno. I kind of get the idea that all things are a little messy but it's kinda fun to pretend. He'll be glad to have a girl who isn't as freaked-out as you." Her eyes were sparkling with excitement.</p> <p>"I have to admit the best part was that I'm not sure how you guys ended up in here together," she said, "and I mean we were kinda drunk and the first thing I realized after I got back was I had never gotten with my parents back there. I think they were really pissed that my parents weren't invited."</p> <p>I felt a little jealous. Not only that we had met at someone's house but that she really met him!</p> <p>"But since we met, I don't think that you have made a move on my father yet," I giggled, "so we're just going to wait here until tomorrow to make sure he's not expecting me to come."</p> <p>"Oh, come on!" she yelled, "I know it'll be fun for you two!" and she jumped up and started to run towards the bedroom door! "We might be able to talk more later."</p> <p>I stood up and said, "I've gotta change." I started putting my clothes on.</p> <p>"I had planned on you just coming and getting back to my room to get dressed but I guess I forgot."</p> <p>I quickly changed.</p> <p>Once I was totally dressed I came right over and put my arm over her shoulder so that she could feel my erection through the front of my pants.</p> <p>"That's really nice," she purred.</p> <p>Once we made it to the bedroom I kissed her gently and started to get out of the bedroom with her.</p> <p>She pushed me against the door and we were kissing once she was out of the way and got down on her knees. Her hands ran up and down my body. I could tell that we had been touching for a long time but didn't want to get too rushed so we stood there. We took our time kissing while our hands ran all over each other.</p> <p>When I first put my head in between her huge breasts she reached around and pulled my ass cheeks apart, giving me better access to her hot and horny pussy. I started to doze off just before she said, "No, get back in here!"</p> <p>I crawled back to the bed and laid back against the pillows. She got on the bed and pushed me out of the way. She started to kiss her way down my body, stopping at every spot she wanted to be touched and tasted. She made the first move with her mouth, kissing me gently with only a couple of inches of room between us. She worked her way down to my hard cock, which was starting to get erect again. I felt her hand at the base of my penis and gently started to stroke it with her hand as she made her way back up my body. As she kissed, she would kiss my nipples and then continue to lick themâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
