I moaned softly at the touch of her lips, then groaned with pleasure as she ran her fingers along the underside of my dick and squeezed me.</p> <p>"This isn't the first time you've done this, is it sweetheart?" Aya asked.</p> <p>"No." I replied, nodding my head in agreement, smiling because she was doing something right.</p> <p>Now that we were back in a position where both women were kissing the tip of my dick, the other one started going down on it, her hand going to another part of my dick with little twists. The feeling and taste were both new to me... and the scent was just perfect to the taste of her cunny on her lips.</p> <p>I pushed my hands into the front of Aya's head and started to push it up and down the base of my dick, which had gotten really hard when I felt it.</p> <p>"Good," Aya cooed, as she pushed my balls gently up against the base of my dick. She kissed them and took them in her hand, rubbing them as she moved her mouth up and down my shaft, making an "um-hmm" as she licked the underside of my dick.</p> <p>The feeling was just absolutely incredible. I was feeling nothing like this in years! It was kind of like masturbating at this moment, but with a more primal feeling.</p> <p>"Oh!" I moaned, surprised when I felt her tongue start to slide along the underside of my dick. I had never had one of these done before... nor had I known of a woman's tongue on my dick. It felt like a dream come true!</p> <p>Aya must have felt it too, because she got up off of me and told her partner to lay on his back. Then she straddled him and I reached for her, kneeling over her as she was on top of him.</p> <p>"Is that okay?" I moaned as she guided the head of my dick to her pussy, but then started sliding it in as I was already there. "I can't fit you inside of me... but I can get you in there."</p> <p>"That's okay." She told her partner. "Just go slow, and just breathe easy."</p> <p>I was trying hard to do what she said. I was so lost in the moment that it took me a few seconds to register my surroundings. Aya was lying on top of me, my cock still in her well-oiled pussy. We were both looking up at the ceiling, eyes closed as we started rocking back and forth.</p> <p>I wanted to do everything but thrust into her, but was trying to hold back. I was feeling very good, my hand moving all over her. It felt amazing!</p> <p>"Oh, wow!" I told her.</p> <p>"Mhm," she said. "That was amazing."</p> <p>"Yeah," I told her, continuing to thrust into her. It felt great!</p> <p>"Now I know for sure that my lips will be wrapped around your dick," I told her. "They're always tight on your dick, aren't they sweetheart?"</p> <p>"N-no," she said as she started to grind her hips faster, her legs sliding up and down on mine, creating a smooth friction. "They are tight on me, too." "Good, because you're fucking really tight on me," I said, trying to catch my breath.</p> <p>"Ooh, I love feeling you inside me, babe!" Aya cooed, her moans of happiness adding to my pleasure.</p> <p>"You're a very special girl, my sweetheart," I told her. "I've never wanted anything as much as I want to be inside you right now."</p> <p>"We're going to have so much fun." I said as I felt her start moving her hips faster, causing a wetness there. "I want this to be wonderful for you so much... I don't know if I'll ever be able to get used to having you inside of me."</p> <p>"I don't know what you're talking about." Aya said as she put her hands on my chest and started lifting herself off of me. "But you'll see for yourself..."</p> <p>"And I'll get to feel it inside of me..." I answered, sliding my hands around her sides, holding her there, as my hips started thrusting into hers to meet hers.</p> <p>"Mmmnn... ohhh..." Aya moaned as I started to slide out of her. "Oh, please... please do it again... ohhh..."</p> <p>Aya lifted herself off of her partnerâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
