If you've had enough then maybe you should tell me where you've been and I'll let you go. If you've had more then..."</p> <p>I could feel the fire of desire ignite in her eyes. She was excited and quite frankly I had no idea how to begin to explain it.</p> <p>I continued; "There was nothing in my world more important then how lovely your body is and how happy it makes me. I think this, too, was a most wondrous gift."</p> <p>"Oh, I think you do," she giggled as she said it. "Is that a question?" Again her eyes went around the room and found and found their way onto my face.</p> <p>I laughed as I looked into those eyes. "I take it I'm not the only Master who likes to see you naked."</p> <p>"No, you aren't," she said simply. "At least, not fully. In fact, if I don't get to the sex soon I won't see my slave long. She's already lost her mind." I laughed again as I added, "Besides, I told you she was a very beautiful slave, isn't she?"</p> <p>"Yes," came the voice of Milly in the dim lit room. She looked up from its memory table that held the photos that I had left. "Yes, she is." Her eyes went back to my face and seemed to linger there.</p> <p>"So the only thing that you were sure you would mind doing was taking your own clothes off. Did you think about me being your slave?"</p> <p>It was obvious that she didn't want me doing that; "I don't think I wanted to do that. I'm afraid that it would be an indignity that you'd want to see me doing."</p> <p>She didn't even blink as she said it, but she looked at the pictures again. There was a sense of anticipation in her eyes and she seemed to be waiting for the opportunity to say something. "It would be a pleasure, actually. I'd like to see you nude too." She was looking at the photos of me in a state a little more serious right at that moment. I'd almost forgotten about her. I saw the lust in her eyes as she continued to read my name on my face. "I wonder if it makes for a more interesting lifestyle. Why, are you looking for a slave who would come here and be your slave? Can't you find me more interesting than that?"</p> <p>"Well, I'd love to be your slave."</p> <p>"I'm sure you are. I know that for a few minutes it would be difficult for you to be with another woman." She laughed. "Maybe another woman, though, isn't it?"</p> <p>"Why, yes, it is."</p> <p>"And besides, I thought that we'd have a threesome, I mean, a real threesome. A threesome with another woman. Would you like that, a real threesome?" Again she looked at the photos. "I want to see."</p> <p>She seemed to think about it for just a minute before she said. "Maybe you'd like that, too. I mean, we won't know the rules of it, but I'm sure you would like to have a threesome with another woman."</p> <p>As my face reddened I added; "What do you say? Of course I'd like to have a threesome with another woman."</p> <p>"I'm happy to go along with that," she said with a smile. "It would mean that I could be with another woman, no, other men, but there's no question as to when we'll be able to share my slave, now that I've seen you. You won't do anything that I didn't think you wanted to do."</p> <p>I tried to smile, but it was hard because she seemed so serious at that moment as her eyes roamed about the photos and I knew that it wasn't what I had wanted to talk about.</p> <p>Milly was right in front of me but I could think more clearly on that. She continued speaking for just a minute then I realized that she wanted me to stay in complete control of the whole situation. It was her way. I hadn't really gotten into it so much as what she had been hinting at with me at the beginning of my marriage.</p> <p>"I could stay here if you really want me to," I offered.</p> <p>She thought it over for just another few seconds then responded. "If you really really would rather stay, I'd understand, if you'd like."</p> <p>My face was burning a little under her gaze. It seemed almost a touch of panic when she said; "Yes, I'd like toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
