"And I really should give you a hug, too," he added, with his head still resting on her shoulder. She could feel his chest rising and falling, and she smiled a big, happy smile at him.</p> <p>"No, no, stop, that's not a nice way to start," she replied as she took his hand again, "we have time." She pulled away from him and sat on the sofa, pulling him over to her and letting him hug her from the other side. He pulled her against him in a tight embrace and she enjoyed that. But then she realized that she was still naked except for his shoes, and the shoes she had worn earlier, as well as the necklace they had given him. She thought about that for a second.</p> <p>"How did you know that I'd left my underwear for you?" she asked. "You said you had to know," she added.</p> <p>"Well, in for a penny, in for a pound," he replied, "and I did think it would be an amazing gift."</p> <p>"I love you, my lover," she smiled again, "and I'd love that inside me, if it were possible that we could continue."</p> <p>Michael smiled at her, not believing all of what he was hearing. He had been waiting for her to say something along the lines of, "No," but in his heart, he knew that she had simply said "Yes," and she had never said no this evening.</p> <p>"How do you feel?" he asked, trying to see into her eyes. "Is it safe? I mean, this is really very nice, you know, but it's not as if you're having some kind of weird or weird night with the whole neighborhood, you know, just some random, um, one time." He didn't even know what that was, but he had to give her credit for trying to help him overcome his nervousness about what she had intended to do. Of course it had been very awkward, at first. It had been because she had decided to be a bit more daring in bed than that, that's why she had dressed up just a little earlier than he had, and it was also because she had told him that the night was really turning her on. In truth, she had probably been feeling that way a good deal earlier. But what really had been a strange feeling had been when he had first seen her, and he knew that what they had done would probably be a lot to take in later.</p> <p>"It's ok," she replied. "This is for all of our enjoyment and, really, that's all I really want right now."</p> <p>He leaned forward and kissed her cheek, which he knew was going to be covered by her ear as he reached up to undo her bra. After he had slipped her bra off and slid his hands along her full breasts a little lower, he stood and pulled her hips into him so that her ass was nestled against his groin. She moved to kiss him, but his hands went around her and grabbed her waist in a firm grip. He let his hands move between them so that they were holding one of her breasts. He pushed his chest against her as his mouth went to her ear.</p> <p>"Suck on it, please," he said softly.</p> <p>She smiled at him and did, first with her lips and teeth, and then her lips and tongue and his to his ear, and finally with a hand on either side of his head, urging him onto her. And he did just that, his mouth on one of her breasts while she kneaded the other gently with her own large breasts. Her hands went up and around his neck on both sides and back. Her legs opened wider and her weight came forward.</p> <p>She was so close, and when he finally released her from his grip, she let her head fall back. She was already breathing heavily and her cheeks were flushed. But then she realized what she needed to say.</p> <p>"Oh, oh no," she heard herself say. "Honey, this was not planned, it just sort of happened, I'm so sorry, I know you want to, you have to say something." And suddenly she was afraid of what she might say. What if she made another wrong choice, or a new one that she hadn't considered?</p> <p>"You are not being completely honest with yourself tonight, Katie," Michael said softly into her ear. "If you're too uncomfortable we understand and will just do it our way, but right now, you feel the heat building between us, and I want you to feel my warmth radiating from me."</p> <p>He reached down and put his hand back on her hip, giving her some more space to get her mind in the right orientation while she let the words sink in.</p> <p>"Yes, I wanted you to, tooâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
