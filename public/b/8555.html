Looking up into her eyes I said, "Your turn."</p> <p>I kissed her forehead and then down her neck. I started to kiss in between her shoulder blades. As I slowly made my way down her chest, I could feel her body tense up. I quickly kissed her neck and then down to where her cleavage was almost completely exposed.</p> <p>My lips followed my eyes. I kissed from one to the other. I kissed down to her breast. I kissed around the edges and then pulled back up to her nipples. Her breathing was becoming heavier.</p> <p>She moved over me and straddled my lap. She wrapped both arms around my neck and kissed me hard. I could feel her breasts pressing on my chest. She looked down for a time and then slid her fingers between our bodies and pulled my sweatshirt up. I slid my hands over her shoulders and helped her free the cups of her bra. When she was done, we just stood there holding each other for a long time.</p> <p>We finally broke for air. She then lay down on top of me and put my head on her left breast. She leaned her head back and said, "That feels so good."</p> <p>There's nothing like a guy's wet pussy...and so do her tits. When he moves his hips upward and presses against my cock I slide upward to the side of the bed. She was now on her back with her skirt pulled up to her waist. She started to pull my sweatshirt up to my stomach. I don't know how she does it. I don't remember much of what happened in the last hour.</p> <p>She pulled my sweatshirt up and off and then started to kiss my chest. I can honestly say that she's the best lay a guy has ever had...well except for the woman. She had my cock in her hand, looking up at me with a smile, and gently kissed it over and over. I moved my hand to her thighs and began to tease her labia. She seemed to be soaking wet. She took the hint.</p> <p>She moved her hips a little, then pulled my sweatshirt up so my bare chest was on bare skin. She moved her mouth to kiss me again. I could feel that she was wet and hot. She put her hands on my breasts to caress them and pull on my nipples.</p> <p>After a moment of this, she moved down my stomach, letting her lips trail along the inside of it. Every inch of skin felt like a new lover's lips were there. I felt the cool air rush across my stomach and then the heat and softness of her lips as they moved higher, higher up.</p> <p>She stopped at my navel. She traced the line of my pubic hair with her tongue and then sucked my lips into her mouth. I could feel the vibrations of her lips as they brushed over them. The taste in her mouth was wonderful. Then she moved between my legs. As she reached my lips I felt that she was going to take me right into her mouth. That's when the strangest thing happened... I couldn't believe it, but she started with her tongue and then slowly and gently moved up my body, stopping to kiss every inch and then moving in for the kill.</p> <p>She reached my clit, but then did something I didn't expect. She reached down and spread my ass up slightly. I was now spread in a second for her. Her hand went around me, cupping my balls in her hand. She slowly and carefully started licking my anus. I was shocked that she could do it, but I had never had anybody do it to me before and I knew it would drive me crazy.</p> <p>"You're really wet." She looked a little down at me. "What I'm doing is so wrong." She lifted up my waist and then continued up my back. I put my hands on her back and pulled her toward me. She positioned herself between my legs. She took my hard cock in one hand and guided it in to her. Our eyes met and she broke the kiss. Taking her hand she pushed my cock deeper into her body. After a moment of feeling that she stopped. She looked down at my cock and said, "Sorry... don't go in."</p> <p>She looked up at me and then started pulling me out slowly again. I could feel her hot juices pouring out around my cock. Then she slowly came back down on me with her mouth again. Just as I wanted, she sat up and then started sliding down to take the entire length of me into her mouth. She bobbed and sucked with all of her strength, and I could feel my orgasm starting again. She stopped just beforeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
