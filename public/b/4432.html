It makes me feel sexy."</p> <p>"You know, these feel fantastic on you." I said looking up at her full, dark brown eyes, and my cock.</p> <p>Her legs were a bit wider than mine now so my cock was touching her thighs on the right side of her ass cheeks. As I leaned forward, her breasts were resting lightly on her stomach.</p> <p>She sat her feet apart as my cock pressed between her legs.</p> <p>"Mmmmm, that feels nice." she said almost looking up at me through her lashes. "Oh you have a nice cock." she said again a long breath and just as softly as before.</p> <p>"I have a feeling that you are going to enjoy this." I said looking down at her eyes.</p> <p>When I spoke, her eyes followed in my hands. I started on her nipples and slowly began pulling them up and down. "That feels fantastic." She said almost breathing deeply and then looking up at me, she smiled. She looked very sexy.</p> <p>While I continued to play with her nipples, I slid my hand down and began to rub her pussy lips through her shorts. The shorts had a large wet spot on it, which made my hard cock even more pronounced. And, as I rubbed her lips, she had opened her legs further. I could sense her wetness was getting more wet, as her shorts rubbed against my cock through the fabric.</p> <p>"Oh fuck..." she muttered, looking deep into my eyes.</p> <p>I slowly began to move the shorts lower on her hips. "It would be so nice if you kept those wet so they wet the side of your face." I said quietly as my fingers moved up a bit. With my free hand, I slid a finger over her clit.</p> <p>"Oh, oh, oh." she said loudly, not saying much.</p> <p>But, I knew she wanted to make a move. The next motion was much harder than before and when I brought my finger up to her clit, she was now breathing deeply and rapidly, letting out loud guttural sounds. My fingers kept pressing on her, and were making little circles around her clit. I moved my hand from her clit and let my middle finger rest on her.</p> <p>"Fuck me with your finger." she said almost out of breath now, eyes staring at me again.</p> <p>As I slid my fingers up and down her slit, her breathing was becoming more labored. One of her hands gripped the back of my neck and pulled me to her. Her other hand was on the back of my head, holding me to her mouth. Our lips came apart, tongues meeting. We had never kissed in that way before, just the kiss of lovers. Our tongues were like two snakes. I felt a slight trembling in her knees. My cock was pressing into her ass now, and she was grinding herself into my hand as we kissed. We broke apart just long enough to whisper "Fuck me!"</p> <p>Both of us felt the electricity between us. We both wanted. In some way, our passion was matched in another. Slowly, we sat on the bench and began kissing and licking each other's face, ears, necks, mouth's, and ears until she finally got the words "Take me." We heard the click of her front door open and close.</p> <p>"You aren't going to do anything that will make an arrest. I'm just going to give you what you needed, and it will be worth it. You just wait to see what happens from here."</p> <p>As I slid my shorts and shorts down, my cock was now straining against my shorts. I knew I could cum in only a few minutes if I didn't cum right here.</p> <p>I stood and grabbed her waist.</p> <p>"C...take me?" she repeated to no one in particular.</p> <p>"Yes." I answered and felt the head of my cock slide along the slit between her thighs, which were now parted.</p> <p>I held my cock and gently pressed it against her soaked pussy lips and then I slid it between them. I felt her gasp as my hard cock slowly began to slide up into her.</p> <p>My hand slid down and across her ass cheeks as I felt the soft hair on her pussy. My cock slid smoothly up into her and I felt her body tense.</p> <p>"Oh fuck..." she murmured in my ear. "Fuck me."</p> <p>I felt as my cock slid easily up inside of her. I just kept fucking her. Slowly now, but the pressure never stopped. Slowly, the pressure built up as I felt the pressure on my cock getting more and more intense.</p> <p>I looked into her eyesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
