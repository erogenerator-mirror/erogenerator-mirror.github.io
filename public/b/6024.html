I asked.</p> <p>She nodded. "I, I've always wanted to try. I never knew a man could be good for me, and with him, I never felt so fulfilled." She smiled. "He will be good for me. I hope it doesn't hurt to have him."</p> <p>"It will hurt," I agreed. "Just think about it. He would not take the time to explore me. He would take the time to touch me. He would feel my body. He would rub my breasts, lick her nipples. And, he would make love to me. I knew I should stop talking and just enjoy some of that pleasure."</p> <p>I closed my eyes and pictured her in my mind. Her head was on my neck. Her breasts were soft and yielding, and her nipples pressed into my back. Our bodies were touching. She was a goddess. And, oh so beautiful. She was a goddess and I was nothing more then her lover.</p> <p>And, my thoughts went like that. I was her lover and all I would ever want would be her. The thoughts of her were like a fire on my cock. There was no way to deny it, but it was necessary.</p> <p>That night in bed, I was thinking about how she made love with my body. I still did not know why but I would have liked to share it with her later. Then, all thoughts of sex with her disappeared. I drifted off to sleep in the knowledge that the next time would be betterâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
