I don't need much of an explanation. Do you want to start with me playing with your big cock?"</p> <p>"Oh yes, I would love to. Do you want to put it in or come in me?"</p> <p>"Mmmmm, let's have a nice evening and explore the wonders of sex together. I don't want to spoil anything, but can I be your one and only for now?"</p> <p>I said, "OK, but I think we should leave your cock here so you can enjoy the fruits of your labor!"</p> <p>I pulled back the foreskin and held it, stretching it out so he could see.</p> <p>"Does it taste different? If it is, don't worry, like the fruits you like, it tastes just like yours."</p> <p>We continued down my pole with slow strokes, enjoying each other's body to the fullest. It was difficult to control him, but I was happy that I was with my own pleasure so much. As our climaxes became stronger, he began to push his hips as he pumped into me faster and faster, and I felt his cock head rubbing against the back wall of my rectum. His penis pulsated as spasms of pleasure shook his body, making it throb even harder with his hands on my waist gripping me.</p> <p>His thrusting slowed down, and his cock softened, although it was still semi-hard. He lifted his hands to my breasts and squeezed them.</p> <p>"I like that a lot," I moaned as my eyes closed and I savored the feel of those hands squeezing my firm breasts.</p> <p>As the last of his orgasm subsided, he turned down the bed so they were spooning, and he placed his left hand on my tummy.</p> <p>"I want you to know what to do next." He said. "Go ahead."</p> <p>I reached down and slowly pulled his cock up again, causing it to jump again just as he was about to do it again but this time he stopped it. We lay like that, side by side, his dick still soft, and his hands gently pinching and pulling at my breasts again. After a while, we could feel him getting harder again, and he put a hand on top of mine which had been resting on his penis.</p> <p>"This is what I like," he said, "and what you should do."</p> <p>So I got onto my back and spread my legs.</p> <p>"Come here, and put your head on my stomach and let it stay there. Feel my abs with your lips, and when you go on my thighs, you are making love to my tummy. Let it rest there."</p> <p>I felt his dick and his hands move down my stomach and between my legs, and he got his head down to my vagina, where he parted my legs, and looked at it. I felt his tongue on my outer lips. I wanted to say something to tell him that he could proceed further in that area, but we had already made love, not once, today, so all that could come was something to do. My head was still on his stomach, so I didn't let it drop down, so I was totally lost in him. His tongue moved more, moving down from my vulva, until he was licking my pussy lips again, which he was doing as well as his hands, which were on the bed now, on my breasts as I sighed.</p> <p>"You are a sweet lover, and I am going to make you feel as good as ever. Go ahead, and stick your tongue in there until you feel it touch you again, so you know I'm going to go on again."</p> <p>So I moved myself on the bed, with him still on one side, and I started moving it in circles with my tongue, slowly, almost as if I was teasing a cat, not really. It felt wonderful. The sensations of him licking my pussy made me moan, and it was wonderful, as I loved it when it was as my body was reacting to his tongue.</p> <p>When I felt him gently moving his tongue inside me deeper to my cervix, and I started moving my hips slowly in rhythm, he stopped moving his tongue out and let it slide in a little bit deeper then slowly moved his tongue in circles again. His tongue felt good, but the sensations in my vagina were getting stronger, as I felt my juices start to flow. I moaned louder as he took his tongue out again.</p> <p>"Don't stop now. It feels like my tongue is working in a circle for you; it feels good, but you need to feel it on my balls," he said, trying to sound soothing, which he didn't really be at all, as I felt him pushing his hips up and down slowly, slowly, until his penis was completely inside me, and he was resting on my pelvis.</p> <p>I closed my legs tightly and wrapped my hands around him. I pulled myself up onto his cock and wrapped myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
