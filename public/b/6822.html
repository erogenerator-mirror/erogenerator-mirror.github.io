A shiver ran through them. As the two men left, they walked back and forth nervously. For a moment, he tried not to think about the possibility of being caught.</p> <p>Then, he remembered his own life. He remembered it for the first time this summer, and his eyes became full of tears.</p> <p>"Are you alright, honey?" he heard Sam answer softly.</p> <p>He turned to see Sam holding a small hand full of papers. He held them out to him, and he was brought back to the present by a long, loud knocking sound outside the door of his classroom.</p> <p>"Shit," he said. "Just what did they want?"</p> <p>"They don't," answered a man in a well-oiled voice, "Not from you. This is for you."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm okay," he said.</p> <p>Sam laughed.</p> <p>"Well, you must be," he laughed back, "They'll pay to come to my office around eight."</p> <p>"Yes, ma'am," smiled the other man.</p> <p>Tom quickly walked to his desk and grabbed a pen and a piece of paper. He wrote an address, and after he placed the papers in the lock, he followed the man up to Sam's office.</p> <p>Sam's room was on the first floor of his home office. Tom pulled the door open and was greeted by a large suite with a fireplace, a nice couch, a loveseat, and a nice bar. The suite was built into the floor and walls, allowing easy access for the men.</p> <p>"Do you want coffee?" said the man behind the desk.</p> <p>"Sure, let me go ahead," replied Tom, "And I'll get you some coffee."</p> <p>He grabbed one of his coffee mugs and headed into the kitchen to refill it. Then, sitting down at the end of the couch was Sam. He was seated in front of her with a mug of steaming coffee.</p> <p>"Thanks for coming over this morning," Tom said as he sat down next to her.</p> <p>"Yeah," he answered.</p> <p>Sam's face fell into a quick smile. "Why don't I show you the office a little better?"</p> <p>Tom leaned on Sam's desk. He leaned down to kiss her softly on the lips. Slowly their tongues entwined as they shared the beverage.</p> <p>"How did you know where the office was?" asked Tom.</p> <p>Sam smiled. "I heard what you said, about me being a little too much of a pussy for you," she whispered.</p> <p>"It's fine, I don't mind," Tom answered. "I like talking to you."</p> <p>Tom gave Sam a quick kiss on the mouth. He then stood up to leave. He stopped when he saw that Sam was watching him.</p> <p>"I'll see you later," he said.</p> <p>Sam smiled.</p> <p>Tom left the office and walked back to his office. He locked the door and looked back at the man in question standing over his desk. He shook his head as if to shake the dust off the desk was that his finger and thumb just touched.</p> <p>"Come sit down on that couch," said Tom. He took of his shoes and socks and set them on the arm of the couch, then he sat down on the couch next to Sam. He leaned back to see. "If you can't come to me for breakfast, then join us for breakfast in a little while. Don't get up until about nine."</p> <p>The man in question looked around the room at the other students. It seemed to be a student's dream to have a good English lesson.</p> <p>"It's not so bad if you get the hang of it," Tom said. He looked at the man he had noticed and waved the hand as if to motion the professor over. "Maybe we can find someplace to eat and drink in the cafeteria this afternoon. After that, we can go to the movies."</p> <p>The man looked around the room, but his eyes kept returning to Tom. "I was joking, Tom. You just made me nervous."</p> <p>"I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, Sam. I just thought you might like some of the food you know I like."</p> <p>Sam looked at Tom. "Well, what do you think? I'm not exactly a screamer or a fast reader," Sam answered.</p> <p>Tom chuckled. "I'm sure you can get by without it, and I'm not a screamer either. And anyway, if it doesn't work, it's fine, the men have fun."</p> <p>Sam laughed again. "I'm not the screamer. I just want to hear you say nice things about me."</p> <p>"Okay then, it works for me," Tomâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
