"I'm going to get this little game over with now. Don't expect to love this little game too much, okay?</p> <p>You walk me to the side of the bed and take my hand and walk me around it again until you're behind me with your arms around me. "Let's get this little game out of the way now Honey. It's time we really got to know each other and really have a good time!"</p> <p>You bend me over at the waist with my head on the bed and my back on the bed. You put your other hand around me and gently rub my clit. You slide two fingers in me and slowly fuck me. I love it. I love it. I love you!"</p> <p>While I'm talking you have moved to a position on all fours with my head on the mattress and your body next to mine. You whisper in my ear "Tell me when you're going to cum again and I'll go do that! I can't wait much longer!" You slide your thumb into my ass and move up.</p> <p>I feel your other hand start to rub my pussy again. I start fucking you back just as I want to. I'm so horny. I'm not sure if I want to do that, but I do.</p> <p>Then you start finger fucking my ass for me and I start fingering your puckered hole. Your moans getting louder and your thrusts ever deeper. I can tell you're getting close. My own pussy gets soaked with my wetness as I start to lose control. I think, oh no. I'm going to burst.</p> <p>"Oh, Honey, you're going to make me cum again, aren't you?"</p> <p>You respond with an earth shattering roar, "Oh, fuck! I'm going to cum, don't stop! Please don't."</p> <p>I can't help myself. I'm so close. I hear you let out a long groan as you start to buck. I know that's it. I hear you say, "Oh, Yes! Take me, take me, and make me cum."</p> <p>Your body shudders in response to the contact with my pussy. You collapse on me on the bed and your arm comes up and wraps around me. We lay together with our arms around each other and your body still under me. When you turn your head, you say, "So, how was your first time with another man?"</p> <p>"It was fantastic Honey, better than I have ever imagined. You felt so good inside of me and your cock tasted so good in my mouth. I wanted so much to be your fuck toy and never tell anyone about it, but we agreed that we needed the freedom and privacy. I knew from the beginning we would never stop loving each other but we both decided we really enjoyed the time we were together."</p> <p>I kiss you softly and caress your hair. You seem really very happy and relaxed. We don't know how long we'll be together, but we'll tell you that much more in the long run. We both lay still for a few minutes.</p> <p>"Did you really enjoy yourself?" you speak softly into my ear.</p> <p>I respond with, "It's very enjoyable. I've enjoyed many times this first time, but this is really new and I really feel special."</p> <p>"How do you feel about your first time? Was it the same as yours?"</p> <p>"Sure it was and we'll tell you more in the future."</p> <p>"So, how'd you like to do it again?"</p> <p>"I want to do it all the time."</p> <p>"It will be our secret."</p> <p>"It can be ours also."</p> <p>"Do you trust us?"</p> <p>"I don't know. We need to be honest with each other."</p> <p>"You have to be honest with me too."</p> <p>I can't help but tell you that I love you. You say you trust us. We never get any secrets from each other. We never lie back to each other ever. That takes one's soul to some other level.</p> <p>I kiss you good night with a big hug, "That was very nice. I really enjoyed it. Thank you for understanding." I smile and we kiss a long and passionate kissâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
