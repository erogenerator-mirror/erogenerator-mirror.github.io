She was thinking about my own admission, and I wasn't about to tell her it.</p> <p>"Did you get a chance to fuck that ass?"</p> <p>"I got a chance to fuck that butt." She was trying to put my mind at ease, trying to make it sound like a joke.</p> <p>"Was it so good?" My heart beat fast in my chest as I realized that I had taken the first shot. She was on top of the bottle again, but her face was in the middle of her tits and I had gotten a good look at her ass.</p> <p>"It was good for me, but not for you," she said.</p> <p>"But you like it better," I told her. I reached my hand under her skirt, and found that she had no panties on.</p> <p>"It's not as good as your dick. But maybe we both could get it better." She rubbed her hands over her tits for a little bit, then dropped down. After a minute or two more, she stopped and said, "Can we move down a little, please?"</p> <p>I pushed my trunks down and slid them off. She kept her tits in place, and I leaned into her, kissing her and working my tongue into her mouth again. I felt her hand on my cock, rubbing it slowly. I put my arms around her and pulled her to me. She grabbed my ass with one hand and pulled my leg to her side.</p> <p>"Maybe we can fuck," she said, "Let's cum together, then, OK?"</p> <p>"Oh yeah. That's perfect." She was starting a slow rhythm. I felt her tongue on my dick head. I was thinking I couldn't take much more of this. I pulled her to me so her head was on my shoulder.</p> <p>"Take your finger and move it around." She moved her finger around between our legs, then I used the other one to feel her hard nipples in my palms. She started moaning louder. "Oh yes!"</p> <p>My dick was so sensitive, it was making a little twitch every time her finger passed over my head. I started to feel her tongue on my balls. "I've got to cum. Where do you want me?"</p> <p>"Now!" she cried out. Her whole body trembled, and she pulled her finger up my shaft and rubbed my tip with her thumb before pushing my hand down onto her head. It was too big to handle, but she pushed my hand down, and I felt cum shoot out of me. She took a finger and brought it to her lips, and I could tell the taste was real and not just coming from her.</p> <p>She leaned down and kissed me, then put her lips around my head and worked herself up and down in rhythm with the sucking motions. I was pushing my dick up her mouth so she couldn't keep her lips closed all the way. My body was getting harder. She was going to make me cum, and while she kept up with me, I felt her other hand start to rub her clit. She started moaning even louder. I felt her start to tighten up with her climax. Then it went off. Her body stiffened, and the next thing I knew, a flood of juices exploded around me as she pushed herself hard down onto my fingers. Her tongue went wild on my shaft, and she kept up her rhythm even through her orgasm. Her whole body was tensed up, and I felt she was about to explode, but she kept going until her body went limp.</p> <p>When she finally pulled up, I took my soft dick out of her mouth. She didn't seem to care; the whole thing was white everywhere. She put her panties back in place and pulled off her shirt. She turned around and looked at me. "Sorry I got carried away."</p> <p>"No apology needed there, and that was exactly what I wanted."</p> <p>She came over, grabbed my dick, and started to stroke me a little, then put my dick back into her mouth. She made a little humming sound, and her tongue began to dance along my head. I tried to hold my breath long enough that we could stop breathing, but then I started to pull her head hard down on my dick, and she could tell it was too much. That was enough to send me over. She sucked as hard as she could, and pumped my cock with her hand in two different directions. "Oh yes!" I cried out. She looked up at me with half closed lids, and I could smell her perfume on the other half. "Oh baby," I said. She was almost there. She squeezed my cock with her hand faster, still moaning her orgasm. I could feel it building again. Suddenly I was about to come, and she pulledâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
