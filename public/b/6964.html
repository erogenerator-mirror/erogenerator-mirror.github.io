I tried to tell myself it would never happen but my cock was so hard it was aching. The idea was all too enticing.</p> <p>"Fine," she said and jumped into my lap. I felt her tongue caressing my lips and I quickly responded to her, sucking her tongue into my mouth.</p> <p>"What are you doing to us?" I asked.</p> <p>"Just getting you guys warmed up for a little fun. We're gonna show you just how much we want to get you hard as soon as we get you to come!"</p> <p>My eyes were bugging out as I saw this and then there was the look of intense desire. She leaned toward me and rubbed my cock with her soft hand and my cock jumped as much as I had at the prospect of getting to see that.</p> <p>"I'm not going to suck you off," she said and I just looked at her.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't care. I'm not going to come myself either," I said nervously, even more afraid than before.</p> <p>"Fine," she said and she got up off of my lap and went over to my chair and sat down. She sat there and I didn't know what to expect, but she leaned over and kissed me on the mouth. Her lips were firm and she licked my lips as she did.</p> <p>She said, "I think I like what this looks like!"</p> <p>She leaned in and licked my chin and then kissed it so delicately and hungrily. She tasted salty as she gave it to me and soon I felt the heat coming from her body. She pulled back and then, in a seductive voice said, "I think you're so hot for me you're about to make me come!"</p> <p>"Really," I said and reached out my hands to touch her breasts.</p> <p>"Oh, God," she moaned as my fingers felt the soft, sensitive flesh of her cleavage. I pushed a little higher and she parted her lips, her face a mask of a smile as I started kissing her neck and her shoulder.</p> <p>We kissed deeply for a while and then she leaned over and kissed my tongue as she ran her hands down my chest. I took a deep breath and she sat back and rubbed her breasts over my chest as our tongues dueled. I felt one boob as she rubbed the nipple between my finger tips and my tongue swirled and I watched it as it grew hard in her palm. She kept playing along my body with one hand and massaging my manhood in a way that made me ache.</p> <p>She leaned her head down and kissed my lips and neck, first one side than the other, leaving a trail of kisses all the way down. Her lips moved down and her tongue flicked across my nipples. She looked directly in my eyes and said in a very sexy voice, "My God, I just missed this feeling. I can taste you in my mouth."</p> <p>I leaned back into the chair and kissed her again, feeling the heat of their kiss. I felt her hands on my chest as she rubbed up and down and across my ribs and stomach. It was my turn to be embarrassed, to be nervous and yet I also felt like an animal under her. I felt the heat of her body and the way she rubbed against me.</p> <p>She pulled me to her and kissed me some more but I turned her around and kissed her so quickly I almost lost control. I broke it off when she whispered into my ear, "Oh, my God, I think you feel amazing!" She took her hands and slid back a little, the back of her legs rubbing up and down my legs and I reached up and began massaging her back.</p> <p>"I don't want to hurry too much for you or for us," she said as she leaned in against my chest. Her breasts were on my chest and I wanted to touch them but she pulled my hands away and took my hand and slid it between her legs as though it was a mission to do so!</p> <p>"You have no idea," I said, my eyes riveted on my finger tips as I pushed into her wet warmth. She pressed back against him.</p> <p>We broke the kiss and I looked down at her and took her breasts in my hands as I began to slowly wiggle the fingers of that hand across her stomach. She watched me as I moved with them. I felt the muscles on her stomach quiver underneath my fingers. With each pass across her skin, each finger rubbed the underside of her body. I moved with her as I moved with my hand across her stomach until I felt the underside of her hand where my fingers gently brushed the underside of her breast.</p> <p>The feel of her skin was magical, like a thousand gentle hands and they massâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
