At that moment she knew that the girl beneath her wouldn't be able to keep from going insane but she didn't want to stop. She loved him and she always wanted him... But she couldn't bring herself to let go of him all together, did she? Wasn't it enough to love him that much? But, she needed him to hold her in his arms. She needed him to love her, to protect her and soothe her when she needed that.</p> <p>"Is it all right, Alyne?" He asked again, stroking her hair as he spoke. "Don't you want to make love?"</p> <p>Alyne bit her lip again, looking at him. Did he mean it? Not the way she was dressed, but certainly in a way that didn't suggest a lie. She felt herself getting lightheaded, her heart going a little too fast, but she had to look away, because if she kept looking at him, she'd end up saying what she'd been about to say. And if she did not, she would go over to where she was and say she hadn't felt love in ages but it had been replaced with something else. She would see what was in the girl's mind behind the dark circles around the girl's eyes. "It feels right, Joss, it's so... I don't know. It's just... .ah, I don't, I don't know." She said again, blushing, and she closed her eyes. She felt his fingers stroke against her ear. "I... don't know what to think, Alyne. I never thought I would feel this way."</p> <p>She heard him sigh and she realized how vulnerable she felt right now, just from hearing him say it to her. This felt too damn real, but still she had to say it. "It's what you want, Joss?" she asked, still looking away from him.</p> <p>She felt his hand slip around her shoulders as he lowered them back to the bed. She felt it slide around her waist and she felt an inch sliding between the two of them. His fingers were brushing the inside of her knee and he slid them up a little so she could feel his cock start to push into her as his fingers slid up the other.</p> <p>"Are you ready, love?" she heard him say as his fingers came up and he took the little bit of fabric that she had left on the top of her thigh and slid it away from her, exposing the soft flesh between her breasts. He bent down and kissed her collarbone, his lips lightly taking her earlobe into his mouth as his hands slid down inside her shirt, her heart beating hard in her chest. She felt herself beginning to melt, her nipples hardening beneath his fingers, her breath deepening, until he slid his fingers inside her. He slid one of his fingers down and began to stroke her hard against her, feeling her pussy open up to him as he slid his fingers a little farther inside her and then slid his index finger inside her, and started to pull them out again. She felt the sensation of his finger inside her so different from his cock inside her, and she wanted to say, but it was to difficult, she gasped and her neck arched, pushing against him.</p> <p>"Joss," she said, her voice barely more than a whisper, "please, don't, don't tell anyone."</p> <p>He did not stop, but his finger pushed inside and she felt a sudden change and then he was pulling it out again. She was panting and her whole body was trembling all over, with those delicious feelings of pleasure she'd always known were fleeting, but now they seemed to be overwhelming and she was struggling against him, trying not to show the pleasure she felt without knowing what to do with her hands.</p> <p>"Oh, god, if I don't touch you, please, please don't tell anyone," she moaned when she felt him kiss down her chest, his hand sliding down to the bottom of her little blue tank top before he took it up and over her head. His hands were still stroking her as he reached for the zipper on her skirt, letting her skirt fall completely down just before he let her skirt go.</p> <p>"Please, don't," she moaned again, but as he continued to look down into her eyes she felt herself opening up just a little bit. His lips had slid down to each of her nipples then, slowly, drawing them through his lips and gently biting them as his hands slid round her waist, sliding up and down the front of her thighs and back up again, feeling the swell of her lower belly. As his hands slid around her and slid up to fondle herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
