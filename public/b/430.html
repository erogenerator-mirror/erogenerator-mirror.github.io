"This is too far."</p> <p>"We have some time," I said. "We have to be quick."</p> <p>The first two steps down was tricky. She reached down to grab the bottom of her suit so she couldn't get the top over her head, but was held by her hands. It would have fallen to the floor if it were not for my hand holding her in place. I pushed her shoulders down, and she fell to all her knees. I let her kneel for a while before sliding the bikini off.</p> <p>"There," I told her, "your top is off."</p> <p>She smiled around her gag and stood, giving herself a chance to recover, before I kicked it off of her. I picked her up and put her on the bed. I went into her room, and got a box of condoms, handing them to her with a smile. She smiled again, but this time for different reasons. I walked out to the window and looked outside.</p> <p>"So we're going to do this," I said. "We're not just going to walk away from each other. We're going to come back here with us. It'll be like us and only we, and even more so if we both are good boys or some kind of sexual beast. And... oh there's one of us. So if we're both good boys... I guess we can be good beasts."</p> <p>She nodded her head.</p> <p>"Good beast?" I asked.</p> <p>"My, my, I do believe we're good?" she said. "Do we have any chance of coming back for more time?"</p> <p>I nodded, with a smile. That smile did indeed make perfect sense.</p> <p>I walked back along the beach for some good exercise. After a little longer, the weather darkened, and the sun was beginning to warm the air. Just before I got back, I stopped and watched her get on the raft. There, her head hanging down, she watched me getting changed.</p> <p>"Can I do it?" she asked, with a sexy smile.</p> <p>"What? Are you getting dressed for the water?" I asked.</p> <p>"If I wanted to," she replied. "I did have to let the suit ride for a moment."</p> <p>"Okay," I told her. "The water is free."</p> <p>"But... I don't have any clothes on."</p> <p>I didn't have to tell her that that wasn't true. I'm sure it looked that obvious.</p> <p>"Sorry," I told her. "I'm going to get my bikini off right now. Maybe next time. But, you can always wear the rest when you're not wearing any clothes."</p> <p>"Really?" she asked. "Why should you do that?"</p> <p>"It's just," I said with a smile. "I don't think I have a very good foot fetish, so all I'll do is take that off, no judgments."</p> <p>Her eyes rolled back in her head, probably the most obvious thing of her life.</p> <p>"Okay, fine," she said and got up to leave.</p> <p>"Wait, will that get the water going?" I asked. "I can have a little fun with that."</p> <p>She walked out into the water with her suit still on, but not before I'd taken off her shorts, her shirt, and her bra.</p> <p>"Here," I said to her and sat down. "Try those on."</p> <p>She came out to where I was sitting and gave me a sly wink. I loved it.</p> <p>After the beach was cleaned up, her suit was thrown away as well. She laid in bed, waiting for me to return. She asked me to lie down on my stomach and she lay on top of me. It felt good to have my arms wrapped around her for comfort and it was all I could do to keep from moaning. And when she kissed my cheek and neck, one last sweet kiss, I could barely breath.</p> <p>We were going to get caught... she thought so. Of course, that might have meant her coming back sooner, but this morning certainly didn't. As her tongue ran across my chest, I could feel her body pressing down on me, and I wanted... needed... more.</p> <p>She was still kissing and working down my body, eventually she had my shorts off and was running her lips down my thigh, finally she was lying next to me. I couldn't wait. My cock was so excited I forgot who or what I was.</p> <p>"My turn," I said, getting to my elbows and looking at her. "I'm naked."</p> <p>"Oh," she said, her eyes never leaving me. "You are?"</p> <p>"Yeah," I said, standingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
