I said. "And I am sorry if I was rough with you."</p> <p>"Don't be." She said. "You aren't rough. But you are gentle."</p> <p>I didn't say 'my lord' because of my lack of experience. I'm sure we wouldn't have agreed to that, not before now, not with the fact it was now her right.</p> <p>I leaned up and kissed her gently on the lips. "You're welcome."</p> <p>"I thought so." She said and looked at me, but she was gone. My sister came in, took a drink, and brought another. I thought to myself that since I was still a virgin, I might as well have the alcohol on me and get drunk. I had never done anything with a man for that matter. I think there are no women like you at all, but I'm not sure I would be one just to take a guy's virginity.</p> <p>"So is that how it's going to go?" I spoke with an exasperated voice. "Or is it just a quickie??"</p> <p>She laughed. "I know! My, you're getting into it fast."</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess we should get going." I said. So I started getting out of bed.</p> <p>"What??" She asked.</p> <p>I went past her and started for her door. "I have to go out. We need to get ready for tomorrow night."</p> <p>Her face was a mess. For some reason, I was glad she wasn't going to be up late. She didn't look good to me. "So we're going home?"</p> <p>"Sure." She said. "We're going out tomorrow." I shook my head and grabbed my stuff.</p> <p>"I'm really sorry."</p> <p>"You aren't sorry? Are you?" She was still laughing</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Then what's up with you? You are always being treated like a piece of meat. I would never treat someone worse."</p> <p>"It's been good." I said.</p> <p>"I just don't get what people are like in the first place. Some people are like that, but you're different from them."</p> <p>"Well, you're different. Don't blame you one for treating me better than you can."</p> <p>"I didn't mean to..."</p> <p>"I know that." She said. "And I'm not asking you to get hurt. Because I don't think you do. I think you just kind of get out of control. We can take it from here."</p> <p>"Where do we go from here?"</p> <p>"I guess, if you are willing to do the asking, and do what comes naturally." She offered. "Can you do the same??"</p> <p>I had never even dated a girl. Even in High School I wasn't allowed to date a girl until I knew her intimately. She was a woman, a very strong, very pretty and passionate woman, and that I was willing to give to her in front of all of those guys. So I nodded.</p> <p>She came in and sat down on the edge of her little dresser. "What are you doing? We hardly even made it in the first place."</p> <p>"You got here just in time. You should be the one doing what you're told."</p> <p>She smiled. "Thanks. I'll go start breakfast."</p> <p>"Oh sure." I said and got back into bed.</p> <p>"I need to get ready." I stated. "And I forgot about food. Sorry."</p> <p>She smiled and kissed me. I felt her hand slide down my back to my butt and she squeezed it as she headed towards the bathroom.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>When I was done with my shower, I got dressed and went back out to my room. My dad was already asleep on his bed, and mom was just getting up. I went to my room and sat down on the edge of my bed. I could hear my sisters in the hallway. "Good morning." I said. "How did you sleep?"</p> <p>She just gave me a weak smile that she was used to. "Good." She said as she started getting up and following me to the bathroom.</p> <p>I just started to say "I can't seem to, oh," but she wrapped her arms around me and grabbed me. She pulled me close and I was too. She held my face down against her chest and I was pressed up against her, my face pressed into her bosom.</p> <p>"No kiss goodbye?" She askedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
