I can't stay this way!" She started to sob.</p> <p>"No! You're not. I'm not going anywhere with you. We'll find a good woman." He looked into his car and smiled. "I think I'll call in sick today. I'll be seeing a doctor tomorrow."</p> <p>I pulled a face at her tears, and she wiped them away with her finger. I sat in my car, staring out the window. I stared at the world in a haze of despair, and thought of her on a street corner. I felt a deep satisfaction in my heart, and wanted to see her again.</p> <p>The next day, my friend, Julie, called me, she asked me to bring my friend for a visit. In the short time we had known each other, she'd never come out of her shell, and I felt a lot of responsibility. My friend, was a beautiful thirty one with pale green eyes and wavy medium brown hair. She was slender and curvy, she had a lovely smile and large brown eyes, and her body was trim and toned and fit. She looked like a girl in high school and yet she made me feel confident around her, she was a good friend who loved us, and a sexy one at that. I was a little uncomfortable with her presence, and for some reason I worried about her. She looked good, she was attractive, but a girl that could have some serious issues was never going to happen. At the same time, I was feeling a little bad about this situation, and was wondering what I was doing.</p> <p>"This is a good day," I said to Julie as we drove to her friend's house.</p> <p>"I think we'll be going to a ball, and we'll see what the hell we're doing in that club," She replied enthusiastically.</p> <p>"I have to go to the bathroom, and I need to put on a skirt before they get here."</p> <p>I didn't say anything, and Julie smiled a happy smile that made me feel good.</p> <p>Julie and her friend arrived at the ball club and took a seat at a table. They looked pretty good, and I got the impression that they were in their early twenties, about the same age as I was. I guessed they were in their late thirties or early forties, but they looked much younger.</p> <p>It was a beautiful day, they were in their early twenties and very attractive. The guys made jokes about them not being the best looking he'd ever be, until I saw one of them at a wedding party. He looked like Eric the way he looked at a party with no wedding band. The other guy in the bar, a tall lanky guy, was a bit younger, and he was just kind of hunky, well built, with an ass in the right place. The one we got to talking with got up for the dance, the one I thought that he might be interested in. I'm not sure about just flirting with him on the spot, it might just turn into a conversation, but his look was really good, and he was really good looking. I felt something flutter in my gut, but I didn't tell Julie about it.</p> <p>The conversation was mostly about ourselves and things that we were both thinking about. I started to get a little uneasy in my relationship. I was a pretty self-confident guy with girlfriends who were willing, if not eager to go out with a guy while they were just looking for a little excitement. I just had to have them, but I was starting to wonder if I was being a little hypocritical. I guess I was just trying to find out how they felt about me. I don't think it was any good. The fact that I was a virgin probably wouldn't make up for the fact that I was just trying to be a good friend as opposed to going to a party. I wasn't sure of how to go about asking them to join me. If they were uncomfortable with that, I definitely wanted their support. They weren't asking to spend money on me, they were asking to hang out and watch, and maybe have a go at fucking a hot guy. I was feeling nervous, and so were Julie.</p> <p>"I guess we need to take this party up with some clothes on." Julie said as she pulled her chair out for me.</p> <p>"I guess that's just part of being a girl." She smiled.</p> <p>"Not really."</p> <p>Julie laughed. "You're serious? The last thing she did before we got married was take her clothes off in front of a bunch of strangers. She was embarrassed."</p> <p>"I guess I kind of am."</p> <p>"Yeah. I think she was kind of hoping that you'd come on to her after the wedding." Julie said.</p> <p>I was starting to think she was rightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
