I don't care if I don't or we don't, I want you. I told him what my feelings and I want him to get his heart broken for it."</p> <p>When they had talked about him not talking with her I knew it was going to happen but I still worried about what they felt like and what would happen to them. I would have liked a chance to start with a nice, if only friendship, but then who knows how things change before they change. I thought long and hard about what to do. I had never really gotten to know her before and how she felt about me. She did what I wanted her to do but if I didn't get myself out of the way she wouldn't give me the time of day.</p> <p>She finally admitted, "I do have feelings for you but I'm afraid if I take the time to love you I might hurt you or you hurt me or I'm no good at this or I'll be a shit about it like everybody else."</p> <p>"It's going to take time for me to say those things and you better be ready to take them."</p> <p>"I like you more now that I know you don't have feelings for me. I want to say those things to you and I would not want to hurt you or anyone else. You don't need to feel bad for yourself because the love I think for you should feel good and if you love me you will tell me and that will be enough."</p> <p>"We'll see." I told him with a look and then said, "We have a lot to talk about before we can make any decisions. What I have to say has to wait till we've had a drink or two." I didn't want this conversation to end so I said to him, "I think we need to talk about something else but first we need to leave this room." He looked at me and replied, "The dance floor is in our room." I said "Yes and your wife will dance with you." He agreed and I got up and kissed him as we were leaving the room. My stomach was churning and I knew that I was heading with a bad stomach for the rest of the evening but my pussy was throbbing and a little ache came to mind. I didn't know what to do and didn't know what I really wanted. The last thing I wanted to do was make an emotional mess of everything but it was too late. I knew she had been with other men and I was afraid to make any progress while we were in the room. Our flight arrived at seven that night. We stayed at the hotel a lot and I asked him if that would help. He agreed and we went back to his room to get some dinner. When we came down on the street I realized that I had made a mistake. We ended up at a fast food restaurant and I started to realize, the only thing that would get me through dinner was I had to go home and call my parents.</p> <p>I guess I should have given up when I saw her again and we ended up getting something to eat. When we got in the car she said that she needed to take a quick shower and change into her clothes for the dance. When she got in the bathroom I started and told her what she had done and what our conversation had been about. She said, "Well you better tell me what to do or I'll get it again." I said, "That's a good idea."</p> <p>She looked at me and said, "Ok but I need to get out of this dress." and she got out of the car. I said, "Where are you going?" She replied, "I have a surprise for you."</p> <p>"I thought you liked to get things done in the hot tub." I told her as I got out of the car. The surprise was on the back seat with my clothes but she was already naked. I saw one of the most beautiful sights I had ever seen and could hardly believe that my best friend's wife was getting her pussy shaved and had just made love to another man in public that day. I was shocked how much she had missed it.</p> <p>When they walked towards the tub they noticed that I was naked and they asked me, "What's up?" I didn't know that I could talk that well. I tried to be casual about it but it got worse when they got my hand on the shaft and the front of my dress was soaked again to the point that it was soaking through.</p> <p>They got up and followed me out to the hot tub and told me to lie down and I did. I was sure they had heard my moan when she had made love to me in the hot tubâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
