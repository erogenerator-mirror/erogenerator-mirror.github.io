I pulled my shirt off over my head and dropped my pants along with my shorts on the grass. Taking hold of the elastic on his shorts, I pulled them down. He lifted his hips enough for my dick to slide into him.</p> <p>"I think I like our little play," I said, "I just wanted to see how long it was going to take before I couldn't get it in any more."</p> <p>He didn't even say a word, just wrapped his arms around my neck and thrust his pelvis toward me a little.</p> <p>"It's the longest cock I've ever seen." I said.</p> <p>"You wanna fuck?" he asked, "I'm good for anything now."</p> <p>He turned on the other side and lowered his lips to mine, slipping one of his hands through mine. My arms moved around behind him, holding him tight to me, one of his hands reaching down between our bodies to start caressing my cock. We kissed like that for a little while then he pulled away and started to get up and walk off to lay on the grass.</p> <p>"I want to fuck," he said.</p> <p>I pulled my pants off, got down on my knees and got in between his, pulling his hard on out so his glistening helmet was pressed against my lips again for a kiss. I looked up at him as I started to kiss the tip of his dick again and then opened my lips and slowly let my tongue glide up and down the underside of him while my hand cupped his balls while my mouth and tongue teased him. He got this incredible look on his face but he looked like he was enjoying himself.</p> <p>It didn't take long before I felt that familiar pressure building in the bud of his cock while he started to flex his hips.</p> <p>"Suck my prick," he said.</p> <p>I did as he asked and he put his hands on my head as he thrust his dick all the way into my mouth.</p> <p>"Suck me all the way in," he murmured to me, "I'm coming. Now."</p> <p>I felt the surge of his sperm start to erupt in my mouth and I sucked him hard to make sure.</p> <p>"Oh, that's it," he moaned as he exploded and went off like a fire hose. I pulled my mouth off his cock just in time to catch his come splashing on my face in my eyes, cheeks and nose.</p> <p>"I want this to last forever," he groaned as I slid off him.</p> <p>I had been stroking for some time now and felt a little of something to go with the come and the heat, so I decided to take a shower first. I followed him through into the bathroom and felt the water run over my shoulder into my armpits. I was trying to catch my breath while looking at this guy doing a striptease and I couldn't help myself.</p> <p>He went to the shower again, got in and came out only in his boxer shorts. He grabbed my towel and wrapped it around his waist before he started washing his face.</p> <p>"I don't think I'll be able to do anything about my hair on the ride back to the school. That'd hurt more than it looked."</p> <p>"No it looks fantastic on you," I said.</p> <p>"Yeah," he said, "It's my hair that matters most and I love it on you."</p> <p>"You shouldn't be staring at my hair," I whispered to him.</p> <p>"I'll be your guy for a while," he whispered, "It would be more fun and a lot more fun than being able to think about you and keep looking at your hair anyway."</p> <p>"I think it's time for me to go," I said.</p> <p>"No, don't go," he replied, "Go out there and fuck me, I want to be able to see you from my hotel room so I can see you."</p> <p>At least, that's what I thought until I felt him slide a finger against my ass hole and felt the reaction on my dick. The hot water hitting the small of my back ran so down between my shoulder blades and over my balls. I felt a surge rush through my body, from my dick to the rest of my body, until I started to fuck back. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath and then I opened them just a bit to see him standing over me, his erection and the look of lust on his face. I felt myself grow thicker inside him with the anticipation of what was to come and the image of us together. I closed my eyes again too, feeling his hand caressing my cock through the wet thin fabric of my boxer shorts. It slid lower and lower and closer to my assholeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
