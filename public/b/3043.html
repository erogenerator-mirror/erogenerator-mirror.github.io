You're the only thing that could make me happier right now, and make better time for you and your family."</p> <p>I took her hand again and put it on my heart, and her hand returned to my own, with a warm, glowing glow of happiness.</p> <p>"I'm very happy for you dear, I don't know what I would do without you, but I'm sorry I couldn't be there to make it better for you. You're like a dear brother or a wonderful friend to me, and I was afraid that no matter what happened, you'd come back to me to help me through my problems."</p> <p>I moved my arms away from her, and she pulled me tightly against her, and we held each other as we cried together, while I told her it was my pleasure. "I'm so happy to call you Rachel. You've given me so much to feel. It's only a matter of time before things are right again with us."</p> <p>I took her hands out of mine and she held back tears and hugged me to her. "I love you, Rachel. I never wanted to feel that with you before now as much as I wanted you when I saw you. I love you too, and I know it was wrong on all of my parts, especially for Rachel, but I can't ever tell you how much I love her, and how much I love you also."</p> <p>When we finally stopped crying, our hands were still in the same place, and our faces were only inches apart. I put my finger over her lips, and she smiled at me as she took her finger into her mouth. "You're going to need to clean up a bit, honey." I lifted her face to mine, and we kissed and hugged each other again.</p> <p>Finally she spoke, "I love you so much, honey, do you know how much?"</p> <p>"Yes, I know, but it's not as much as I mean it. I think I've made some friends, and even a couple of very nice ones. I know you need it as much as I do, and more. I know you'll love what's coming our way."</p> <p>And she did. I was amazed, and I know she knew I did, because she had been so honest with me the first time she told me. She told me that her family was very supportive of the past couple of years, and she had helped to bring them to such an end, and I realized I didn't even know her then.</p> <p>"I knew how much you meant to me, Rachel. I've known what to do since the second time I saw you, and I'm sorry."</p> <p>"I love you, too; thank you, sweetheart."</p> <p>After we finished our hug and a kiss on the lips, we stood up together and we kissed, and hugged tightly, as our hands explored each other's bodies the best we could for what we had to do together.</p> <p>She asked, "Do you remember the rest of those memories that we've shared, all those great times with you, and how much it pleased me even to remember them?"</p> <p>"Of course, honey. It was the best time of my life when I saw you, and felt your touch, and when I remembered the way you looked, those were like the greatest memories I've ever had of my life."</p> <p>"Can we do that again soon? I have the perfect memory of what we shared between us, and so far, if you're still coming, I'll do whatever you want to do to me," Rachel asked. "I love being my own man again, and that's what we always wanted."</p> <p>"That sounds great! I always loved sharing your memories as much and as often as you did. Of course, if we can do that a few more times, I think we'll always be a couple on that count."</p> <p>"Maybe one more time, hon, then we can do some talking about us then," Rachel said as she slipped her robe back on, and I could see a big smile on her face that I hadn't seen in ages.</p> <p>"I'm glad to hear you say that, sweetheart. I'll see you in a little while. How about you and I do have some more of that hot chocolate in the oven, or go grab some lunch and sit down?"</p> <p>We walked back into the kitchen, and we both had the hot chocolate in one hand, and the hot tub in the other.</p> <p>"I'm going to have a shower first, and we can talk some more about this," Rachel said.</p> <p>"That sounds great," I answered. I stood up, kissed her again, and said, "Okay, go get me the tub, and I'll get you clothes inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
