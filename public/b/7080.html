"You're too good for your own good."</p> <p>He pulled out to see the look of frustration on my face and, without saying another word, slammed back into me, thrusting himself back into my wet pussy.</p> <p>"Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!" I moaned aloud.</p> <p>With one final lunge into the deepest depths I cried out a low, sexy moan as his balls bounced off of mine. We both lay there for several moments, taking in the feeling of him deep inside me, and not wanting to be parted.</p> <p>"Thank you, Sir," I whispered into his ear as I rolled away from him and pulled up my panties, "That was nice, Sir."</p> <p>He smiled and lay down beside me. I slid a knee between his legs once again, and slowly slid his jeans and shorts back up over his body. When he saw that his cock was standing proud, I gently stroked it, bringing a gasp of pleasure from his lips.</p> <p>"You've done so much for yourself, sir. I owe you one."</p> <p>He just smiled, and he reached out his hand, taking mine, pulling it towards himself to say as quietly, "I'm always grateful, Miss Rose. Always."</p> <p>It was too late.</p> <p>I slipped my panties back on over his cummerbund and zipped the jeans back up. He pulled up the shirt he'd been wearing, a couple shades of red, and handed me his panties.</p> <p>"You can change back into your clothes if you like," he told me as he put his hands in his pockets for a few seconds.</p> <p>I smiled and grabbed the shirt, the last two buttons coming undone as I pulled it over my head. I put my fingers into the waistband of the shirt and pulled it over my head and it slipped down my arms, leaving my breasts exposed. I pulled it over mine and buttoned it, tying the red ribbon between my breasts to release some of my own scent.</p> <p>The shirt was completely wet and when I slid it on over it, we both looked around for a moment. I glanced over at him again, and saw that we were standing behind the camera again. My stomach twisted a bit at the sight of him, but I smiled and looked down at his shirt, feeling slightly guilty, knowing that I had left him wanting my body... not my heart. But, I was proud of how well he'd turned out.</p> <p>I slipped him my shirt back under my arms and buttoned it properly, knowing that I looked like I'd just gotten out of the shower. I slipped on my shorts and went down to the kitchen to get the wine from the refrigerator for the second. I brought it over to him and sat down at the table, pulling one leg up on his lap as I went.</p> <p>"Good evening, Sir," I greeted him as I slid an arm around him.</p> <p>"Good night, Ms. Rose, and yours, Sir."</p> <p>"Thank you, Sir."</p> <p>We sipped our wine as he talked about his day, how he was planning on spending the evening.</p> <p>"Let's do this one first," I said. "I think we should be able to find something that he can really enjoy. He won't be able to get enough of your body to satisfy him like I'd hoped."</p> <p>"You know, I'd have to do it myself," he chuckled. As he sat down in the chair, I took the wine from his hand and poured a little into my hand. I leaned over, taking his arm with mine, pulling him to me as I leaned in for a kiss. His arms automatically wrapped around me as he eagerly returned my kiss. We kissed for several minutes as my arms went under his as I pressed myself against him.</p> <p>"I can tell you want me, Sir," my voice was tinged with a hint of the submissive tone from earlier. "Do you crave me?"</p> <p>He responded with a simple nod. I leaned back against his chest, kissing the top of his cheek and neck once more as I brought another breath of air into it.</p> <p>"Do you want your Master?"</p> <p>He grinned, "Maybe, Miss Rose."</p> <p>With that, I lifted my shirt off to reveal my breasts to him and brought him to me with no protest from his lips to my nipples.
