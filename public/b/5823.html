He pulled her to him tightly, crushing her body against his, and she began to grind her hips against him.</p> <p>Settling herself on top of him, he brought his hands up her arms and found her breasts. He took one in his hand and began to trace her nipple, enjoying the look of pleasure on her face. She pressed her breast closer against his hand and he felt her nipple respond to him. He slid his hand down over her hip and over her thigh till he found the bottom part of her shorts. She spread her legs a little so he could reach under and into her shorts, and he quickly pulled them down over her thighs and off her legs, and left her with only her panties on.</p> <p>He bent forward and slowly kissed every part of her body. He traced her ribs with his tongue, and moved over to her breasts to taste them and to feel them with his tongue. In his mouth, he could feel her body quiver with pleasure as her breasts and pussy began to respond, and his cock began to become hard. He loved the feel of her as she had become. He was glad she liked it. He kissed his way up to her neck, kissing her all along as he kissed her.</p> <p>"God, you taste good," he whispered into her ear, then quickly pulled away to look in her eyes, and see her in ecstasy. She looked so beautiful. And so vulnerable. She looked so hot. He wanted to fuck her right there.</p> <p>"Take me in your hand," he instructed, and she reached up to take his cock in her hand, but he grabbed her hand, stopping her. She began to protest again as he moved his lips down towards her nipples, but he pulled her hands away and kissed them with his mouth, sucking them. She began to feel dizzy. He began to kiss down her stomach, licking her navel, down her belly, and finally to her naked, swollen pussy. Sinking his lips onto her pubic hair, he kissed her there before opening her lips and kissing her just inside.</p> <p>As his lips moved towards her pussy her hands moved to the back of his head. "Put your hands on my shoulders, put the head of your cock just inside my pussy," she pleaded. He did as asked and moved his hands up under her body to touch her breasts, caressing the hard nipples between his fingers. He loved the feel of her breasts. The feeling of her hard nipples in his palms was amazing.</p> <p>He slid his cock out, and she gasped when he moved her feet to move her legs apart. He did so slowly, taking his time for her. He wanted to feel her as she was so much. He moved his cock back towards her pussy and again slid his fingers up slowly, teasing her a little with his fingers. She was so receptive, so responsive. He moved his cock to her opening - slowly, deliberately, so he could tease her as much as he wanted. He pushed against her slowly, and watched her eyes with anticipation. He didn't want to make her wait too long. He would make her feel so good. Her vagina was so wet and open, and when he slowly entered her, it felt so warm and welcoming. His cock went in easily and he began to fuck her gently as he bent forward to kiss her. He lifted her legs up and placed them against his forearms so that she was lying in his arms as he drove himself deep into her. She was so wet. God it was good.</p> <p>As he moved inside her he felt his own muscles flexing. There was a feeling of ecstasy as his cock expanded inside her. It was so good but he needed more. He slowly began to move his cock in and out of her, listening to her whimpers of approval as her body responded. It felt wonderful as he got used to his size.</p> <p>"Do you want me to fuck you harder?" he whispered into her ear as he leaned over to kiss her cheek.</p> <p>"Yes," she gasped. He lifted his face and said, "God yes." She pulled his face to hers and they kissed again as he slowly began to move inside her again. She felt full, as if he were in her, and it felt so good. He paused for a moment to kiss her again, feeling the warmth in her body that his penis moved against.</p> <p>"Where do you want me? Do you want to be fucked?"</p> <p>She replied: "Just put the head of that cock at the entrance to my vagina. God yes, yes, fuck me."</p> <p>He felt a sense of urgency in him as he watched this woman who had given him so much pleasure. He smiled as he began to push his cock in and out of her, making it a smooth, regular rhythm. He felt like he had never gotten this fucking before.
