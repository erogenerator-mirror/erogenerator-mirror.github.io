"It was never anything more than a business deal. Well, not exactly, we tried to save up extra for our vacations but we never did anything like the trip and the one thing we had is this place in New York."</p> <p>"Oh," was all she said as they left the house with her carrying a large bag.</p> <p>"You need to get dressed for a trip," she said. "We should be there in an hour."</p> <p>"How will we get there?" I asked.</p> <p>"Why don't you go down to the airport and drop off your stuff and meet me at the airport in the parking area?"</p> <p>I had decided to do it this morning to see what kind of places we would be visiting but, instead, I decided to stay in the hotel suite to help get things set up. On my way into the room, I took a short look at my clothing but, instead of finding it, I thought I would have to look in my closet for something else.</p> <p>There was a nice little closet in the room and I turned on the light and checked myself out.</p> <p>To my surprise, there was something very nice and exciting about the way the hotel dress was designed. There was a large white canvas sun lounger on the ground next to a picnic chair that looked like it used to have the day care worker that we used. The sun lounger was a little more revealing than the other loungers, but nothing that would really be too uncomfortable. The sun lounger had a big screen, that seemed to have about a dozen screens running over it. The one on the other side had a big screen to show the whole area.</p> <p>The second lounger on the far side had another screen with a big flat screen so that you could sit and watch the waves and people from the beach.</p> <p>There was a small bench in one corner with a couple of chairs on each side. I sat down and they each picked up one of the recliners and I sat there for a minute as they all looked around the area.</p> <p>"What do you think?" said Sarah, speaking up.</p> <p>"It is very nice," added Julie, "not as big as the rest of the resort. The chairs are really thin and it is comfortable to sit here. Maybe you could be comfortable in there and I could sit in that chair."</p> <p>"I think that is the ideal place to sit if you really want to do one of those beach shots."</p> <p>"Maybe," I said smiling.</p> <p>I looked around the area and found that we were the only couples in the area so my roomie and I had a pretty good idea of what the others were talking about.</p> <p>"Let's sit down," said Julie, "we will be right in."</p> <p>They had chairs and each had one of our chairs set up. I looked around and it was not surprising that there were a few people in the water that afternoon. There was one couple in a pool full of clothes. That woman was sitting close to him and she seemed to be looking at Julie as if she really was looking at him. He was smiling at her and she seemed to be looking into his eyes as they passed on their own. It was obvious that his eyes were fixed on her legs and he seemed to be looking at her legs. The next couple of couples I hadn't noticed were on the deck loungers and they were looking at nothing. My guess was that they were interested in what was going on around us and that it wasn't a big deal, that they were just sitting there. I looked at the couples and they were standing about two feet apart talking but at least they were not being too obvious. It was clear that they didn't have on lot's of clothes and that made me wonder how they were keeping their feet under control. Most of the couples seemed to be the same way and they weren't making a scene.</p> <p>Sarah had finished up with her drink and when she was getting another, she got to see the whole beach and the other couple who had taken some time outside. As she was taking her drink, I was checking out the other couple on the lounge loungers. They were very slim and my guess at her age was that she wasn't at all all into skinny dipping and was really enjoying being skinny and being exposed. At one point, she even had a huge smile on her face. She was staring at me and then turned to Julie.</p> <p>"Is your date ready?" she asked.</p> <p>"He said that he had to pee real quick," said Julie. "I'll catch him in a minute."</p> <p>"I think you will catch him soon," Sarah said as she walked over to Julie.
