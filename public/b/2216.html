I'm a slave... a whore." She said as she pulled me down and kissed me. "I like to be owned." She said.</p> <p>"I like that too." I chuckled.</p> <p>She stood up and grabbed my shoulders, and stood again. This time I grabbed her and led her over to the bed. She fell onto the bed. The bed on which I still sat. I pulled her onto my lap and laid on top of her. My hard cock was pressing into her stomach. Her hands slid around and rubbed and massaged each of us, making sure no mess was made. She leaned over and licked my ear.</p> <p>"Now let's get you cleaned up." She giggled. "I want to eat you out."</p> <p>I rolled off of her and pulled back the covers. She looked and gasped. I ran my arm under her shoulders. She laid her head on my chest and let me rub her back, chest and hair. I took a finger and massaged her face.</p> <p>"I know you love being my slave, but you've been missing out on things." I said. "The last time I saw you I was walking in your house and you were naked."</p> <p>"Yes. I'm sorry I was so careless. I'm sure I can handle it." She said.</p> <p>I wrapped my arm around her and pulled her against me. The next moment we were both asleep, tangled together in each other arms.</p> <p>~~~~~ 2 weeks later!!</p> <p>After two days without any activity, I woke up. I felt the bed press between my thighs. I opened my eyes as I realized something had actually changed. I looked down and saw what I assumed to be a beautiful naked woman sleeping next to me. I slowly moved my hips closer to hers. It felt strange, but so natural. My eyes widened as I saw the face of a woman. Her hair was down, and I could see she had long, golden, blonde pubic hair. Her skin was a rich shade of brown, and it was smooth to the touch. She had a face that was angelic, but that beautiful part of her, I guess.</p> <p>I moved my hips forward. Her eyes opened and she sat up. Her mouth came forward and she began to kiss me. I could feel the kiss turning into my body as we made love. I grabbed her beautiful hips and moved to lay beside her. My hands reached up and began to play with her hair. I moved my hips against hers more. I was now in between those smooth legs of hers. My lips went back to her chin. Her neck became my playground. I gently grazed my lips across her jaw up and down. She pulled her body against mine, she was so warm and soft. I kissed her jaw and across her neck. I slid my mouth down her throat over her breasts. She moaned as I bit down slightly on her lower breast. I kissed her chest again and went down to her belly. I reached her pussy. My tongue flicked against the lips, and then down. She moaned as she raised her hips to meet my mouth. She lifted up a little and I ran my tongue quickly across her clitoris. Her hips lifted up as my tongue went back to her sex.</p> <p>"Harder baby!" She cried.</p> <p>I pushed a couple of fingers up into her tight pussy. I rubbed her clit with my thumb as I sucked on her lips. She screamed, as the orgasm hit her. My tongue went in to taste her sweetness. She grabbed my hair and her hips lifted up again as another wave of pleasure hit her. She pulled me away.</p> <p>"I want to go fuck your ass." She said. "I want you to see me do it."</p> <p>She got on her knees between my legs and grabbed my ass. She licked my cheeks and licked and kissed my hole. It was the most erotic and erotic thing I had ever felt. I could feel my orgasm building. I held her hips back as her tongue went inside my ass. She went in and out as her fingers fucked my pussy. Then she came back in for air and looked at me.</p> <p>"Are you ready to fuck me in the ass." I asked.</p> <p>"Yes. I'm ready to fuck you in the ass." She replied.</p> <p>"Turn over. I want a good look at your pussy."</p> <p>She turned over, and I was there staring at her. The beauty of her pussy and ass. Seeing her made me tingle even more.</p> <p>"Lay down." She directed. I did as she said, as she climbed over me. She spread her legs. She slid her pussy over my dick, as she lowered herself.</p> <p>"Fuck that pussy. Cum." she called and then began to stroke me.
