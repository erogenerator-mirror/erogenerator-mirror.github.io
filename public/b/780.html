He held her hair again, guiding it in and out, using her face as support, not so much to pull back, but to keep her head in place. He would have liked to feel her lips all over it.</p> <p>He got up on a barstool at the edge of her bed and started massaging her scalp.</p> <p>"Mmmmh..." she moaned, "That feels nice."</p> <p>"You like that," said the voice again, "does it make you hard?"</p> <p>"Yesssssss," she cried, "fuck me."</p> <p>He knelt behind her, his left hand massaging her ass, his right hand sliding back and forth over her pussy. He teased her slit with his index finger, and she gasped when a finger dipped gently into her.</p> <p>"Oh my god," said the voice, "you're dripping... that's good... feels so good."</p> <p>He got up on his knees before fucking her, making her ass move as he thrust against her, both of them moaning and groaning together as they both got off. When they slowed he picked up his phone.</p> <p>"On the phone, you stupid slut," he said before taking it in his fist. "Now I know how long it's been."</p> <p>"I want to stay in the game, I think," she said.</p> <p>"I thought you might have," the voice said. "You didn't think. All I really need to do is tell you I'm going to be gone for two days. You can do whatever else you want..."</p> <p>"And if I'm not back home before then, I want to be on the phone with you on the phone," she said. Before she gave him the chance to reply, the phone beeped. It was almost nine, and she was hungry.</p> <p>She was in bed after she heard the message pop up in her iPhone's camera when she was finally able to get dressed. They'd been fucking for two months, and she was hungry. But not enough to make love.
