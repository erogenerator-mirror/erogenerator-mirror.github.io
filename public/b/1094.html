It brushed lightly across her outer lips, and she gasped as she felt his fingertips caress her. His fingers dipped inside her and brushed through her wet slit and circled the entrance of her sex.</p> <p>"Oh my," she whispered, her eyes closed in pleasure, "I wish I could be completely naked right now."</p> <p>"Oh, that is exactly what is happening right in front of you."</p> <p>Hearing the words, Karen slid her body back slightly and spread her legs invitingly. Her breasts heaved as she rubbed her erect nipples between her fingers, while continuing to play with them, as if imagining what it would feel like to have a hard cock shoved up inside her when they reached the apex of her legs. Her voice rose and fell, and she was breathing more deeply as he fingered her slowly.</p> <p>"Would you be naked for me if I was here?" He asked, taking a moment to slip his finger back inside her. Her body responded to his fingers, twitching and moving with his touch. After slipping his index finger into her, he worked both finger back and forth and then twisted them around inside her.</p> <p>"Yeah, I will," she agreed, her hand moving away from her breasts, feeling her body tense and shudder. She couldn't quite describe to herself exactly what her body felt like, but she was certain it was wonderful.</p> <p>She closed her eyes and let her body respond to his pleasurable feeling by arching her back and moving her hips in a rhythmic response. His hand remained on her sex as his fingers danced over her, sometimes slipping inside her and moving around inside her before returning to tease and tickle her clitoris.</p> <p>Her body responded to him in ways unknown to her. Her hips were rising and falling, and she was breathing harder again. Her hands were still on her breasts, kneading it gently as his fingers teased her sex. His hand glided along her body again, making her entire body ache for his touch.</p> <p>She felt the pleasure building in her body. It was the first time since that evening they had been together that she got to know what her body felt like. She knew it would be fantastic to be with him. She felt her orgasm building, and the first of many to come.</p> <p>"Please, take your hand out," she gasped, her body still spasming, making her more sensitive to the touch of his fingers, "please. I'm going to come for you. I want you to kiss my pussy. I want you to slide your tongue in there."</p> <p>He stopped his hand, taking it away from her body completely, "Take your fingers and put them in your mouth."</p> <p>"But—but I don't know if I can do it"</p> <p>"Karen, you know what I want you to do. Just put one finger inside me."</p> <p>She smiled, and obeyed, using two fingers to wet the inner lips of her pussy, and inserting them inside herself. As she touched herself, she imagined that she was doing it exactly now, and the feeling of her fingers inside of her caused a fresh wave of sexual energy that she had never felt before. The fingers that had come in her fingers were now sliding over her inner lips and inside her. Her body responded in ways she hadn't imagined possible to feel before. She could feel herself becoming wetter, and the orgasm was building. Her body rocked back and forth against him as she reached the point where she could lose herself in the pleasure and not feel it again. "Yessss."</p> <p>She looked into his eyes, and saw tears of sheer pleasure on his face, "Yes," she moaned, "oh, yes," she chanted, "yes ..."</p> <p>Her body convulsed in another climax that brought on the first of what seemed like a million orgasms. She closed her eyes and moaned loudly. He watched her as she moved her hips slowly, and her body trembled with every movement.</p> <p>"I'd better go, "he said.</p> <p>She nodded and looked up at him.</p> <p>"Okay?" he asked, sitting up on the bed.</p> <p>She nodded. "Okay," she repeated, holding him gently in her hands.</p> <p>"I won't be long. Take care," he offered.</p> <p>"Okay," she agreed, kissing him briefly before leaving the bed to go to her own room.</p> <p>He laid there holding her in his arms, and felt his own body reacting to her touch. He gently caressed her body and moved his fingers from her lips to her nipples, pinching and tugging as she responded to his touch.</p> <p>Karen knew her body was responding to his touch. She could also feel warmth creeping up—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
