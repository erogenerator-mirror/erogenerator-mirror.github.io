He said, his voice soft as he pulled the door wider. He turned his back on her briefly as he slid off his shirt as she pulled off her jeans and underwear, tossing them to the hallway.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," he said, pulling on her hand as if reluctant. "Let's go. There are many more surprises waiting. Come on, we've got to get you out of those wet clothes before we get you into trouble."</p> <p>A sudden rush of embarrassment swept her. "But I...this wasn't my house--"</p> <p>He gave a light laugh. "Oh, stop! Don't be such a baby. Take as much time as you wish. I promise the place will get busy and your clothes will be a mess. Hurry now."</p> <p>"But we can't--"</p> <p>"Nope. Stay right here on the couch. Don't move. When a boy touches him--that's when I'll move up to his lips and fuck him. You may want to take your hands away from your breasts. Be gentle. And be sure you're looking at me."</p> <p>She nodded. And then quickly turned back to her tasks.</p> <p>He was right, of course. His lips were as soft as he had described. The skin around his mouth and the scent of his lips in his nostrils made her knees buckle. She swallowed hard, realizing just how weak she still was. She wasn't even aware that she had dropped her panties and was holding them in with one hand. She was too weak to do more than hold them up and keep her legs from shaking. She looked up at him as he took his clothes off and moved over her, lowering his face into her crotch.</p> <p>The warmth and scent of him washed over her. He kissed her gently as his hand moved over her mound. Her hands fluttered nervously against his head and she felt as if she was afraid he would take advantage of her, but she could do no wrong. He was the one that had her.</p> <p>A new, familiar rush swept through her. It made her pulse speed up. She whimpered as he continued to rub her, circling her clit as his fingers slid inside her. His fingers slipped inside her and she squirmed.</p> <p>"Oh, baby, yes, do that. More, it feels so good. Don't move. Stay still," he said, kissing her face as his fingers moved in and out of her as she moaned. "Good. Very good."</p> <p>The hand around her shoulder was moving gently. She glanced up to see his eyes on her as he leaned over kissing her neck for a moment. He bit her earlobe lightly, teasing her there and making her shiver. He was the one who's hands weren't moving, touching, caressing her. She realized how little her legs could get under her as he brought his mouth back to her ear and nibbled down her neck and collarbone, nipping at her skin as he went.</p> <p>Her heart beat accelerated. Her breathing ragged. She needed to be fucked badly, but she didn't want to come so quickly. She wanted to keep her legs from shaking, but they trembled and her palms were burning against his neck. Her fingers clutched at his hair as she came, trembling and moaning.</p> <p>When her knees went weak and she lay panting, she gave one long, slow, long moan. After a few moments, he pulled away from her and stood up. She followed him as well, holding him gently as he stepped out of his shorts.</p> <p>"You are beautiful. I can't believe you got all wet with me just in your mind."</p> <p>She nodded as she removed his shirt; her mind was now a fog. She couldn't think straight. How did something so simple come so badly? How did she have the nerve to...what? And was she sure this was it?</p> <p>He was shirtless again as she took of her clothes. He had a nice, dark chest and broad shoulders. He was not exactly short, but he had a six-pack that made her breath come easier. As she laid them on the couch and looked down at herself, it dawned on her. She was naked. He had seen her body already. She had had other fantasies—and she knew what she was wearing—but she didn't expect him to take the time to get her all ready.</p> <p>"I think I'm a little overdressed. Let's go change."</p> <p>Her hand reached to the zipper on the back of his jeans and she began to slide them off his thighs, making him turn to walk to the stairs. He smiled at her as she reached down and picked him up and set him down on the bed next to her.
