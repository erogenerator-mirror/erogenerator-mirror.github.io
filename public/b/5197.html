At this point we were all in the bedroom.</p> <p>"So who had the fun" she said as she sat back on the edge of the bed.</p> <p>"Do we know your lover?"</p> <p>"Yes, and how about you"</p> <p>"Your lover" I said.</p> <p>"Don't you think the guys at this club would like to see something happen?" she asked.</p> <p>"You know I sure would."</p> <p>"Well I know it will never happen to me. But I have a boyfriend that wouldn't mind a few days ago. So do you mind if we do a show for the guys. I would love to see it" she said as she removed her clothes slowly, letting me see her body turn and shake with every move. It was a sight she would never forget. After I had stripped she turned and kissed me again. After getting down on all fours she walked over to a stereo. She turned it on, then put the sound up to about 4 or 5. Then she got up on all fours and slowly raised her ass. Soon it was time to enter "this new way to have fun" I thought.</p> <p>Laying on her back as I entered her she turned her head over to me and told me to move quickly. I did and she moaned. Pulling her down to me, she said that the music was for two. I could feel her ass sliding up and down my cock. As I thrust into her she moaned, I could feel that she was close to an orgasm. I knew she wanted me to cum in her ass, we just lay there together and enjoyed the show</p> <p>"Now it is your turn", she said. I rolled on top of her and slowly inserted my cock into her ass. She was so fucking soaked, I couldn't believe how tight she was. I was in her as deep as I could go, her pussy felt better than I imagined would feel. I looked at the ceiling and smiled. I knew she could see my eyes as my cock was all the way up in her ass. I began thrusting hard now into her ass, not only did my cock feel this amazing, but she seemed to be enjoying herself. I could feel myself nearing my limit, she too was about to cum. The music continued as she began to get vocal, moaning almost screams. I knew I could cum in her ass now, I stopped thrusting into her and said I was going to cum in her ass.</p> <p>"Fill my ass up with cum for me. Fill me with your cum honey", she said.</p> <p>I pulled out of her ass. The music stopped, and we remained laying on the bed. She was smiling at me as said "That was incredible Honey" and I walked over to her and kissed her. We continued to lie there for a little while. She seemed so content. "It isn't every day a young gay comes over here and kisses his wife in the presence of a friend". She smiled, then fell asleep.</p> <p>The next morning we were in the kitchen getting the last of the breakfast things put on. Then I heard a car door slam down the drive. "I think he has left the car at my house". And I could hear voices and laughter from the other side. As the door closed I heard her say "I can't believe I just did that to another man". She got up and started running around the table. She then dropped the clothes she was wearing and hugged me tightly.</p> <p>"Oh Honey"</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sorry I have to get out. I have some family I might run into there and not want to leave her."</p> <p>"Oh it's OK. Just bring her back sometime".</p> <p>She then turned to leave but I put a finger to her lips to stop her as she reached my ear.</p> <p>"Don't go I want to talk to you later about tonight." She gave me a kiss then walked out without saying another word.</p> <p>The rest of the day went by pretty much the same. We went out to dinner, watched the show I had put on (she came out to my table and said she had to go. She told him she had to go and he told her he had a great time too). We left about 2, the guy that was sitting there turned and said hello and asked if she was going out again, and she laughed. A little later they both came back.</p> <p>I knew this was about to be a regular occurrence. They went into the bathroom and turned on the Jacuzzi. They had to be hot too which felt good. The conversation was light and they both became aware of it.
