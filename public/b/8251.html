I downed half of the wine in one draught.</p> <p>I followed him upstairs to his room. He was in another bedroom. He turned on some music on his bedside table. I sat on the edge of his bed. He went to his dresser and began opening drawers. He returned with a glass of Chardonnay and a bottle of wine. He poured two glasses and handed me another glass. We clinked glasses.</p> <p>“Well, you seemed to be doing a good job raising these young ladies.”</p> <p>“Thank you, John.”</p> <p>“I wanted to say something, but I have to talk about something. If you want, I’ll even leave the door open.”</p> <p>I took off my coat and hung it on the back of the closet. I took him by the hand and led him to the bed. I leaned into the room.</p> <p>“This shouldn’t be an intrusion, will it?” he asked. I nodded. I sat down next to him and began rubbing my breasts over his chest. I kissed him on the lips and caressed his hair.</p> <p>“You seem to have enjoyed yourself,” I said.</p> <p>“Mmm, yes I enjoyed it very much.”</p> <p>I reached down between his legs and rubbed his erection several times.</p> <p>“Are those for me?” I asked in a little girl voice.</p> <p>“Yes.”</p> <p>“Mmm Hmmm.”</p> <p>I unzipped his pants and lowered them down around his ankles. My hand was stroking his dick under the silk pants.</p> <p>“I want you to fuck me,” I said and rose to stand in front of him. I kissed him. I got up and stood behind him again. I slipped down into the skirt on the bed. Slid my finger into the elastic of her panties and pulled them down. I ran my finger along her slit to her ass.</p> <p>“Oh, God, that feels good,” she said. I put my finger into my mouth.</p> <p>“I’ve been fucking you ever since last Monday,” I said. “You sure gave your pussy a rest.”</p> <p>“Mmmmm, it was different today. I just wanted you to give me another one,” she said.</p> <p>“What do you mean?” I asked.</p> <p>“What do you mean?”</p> <p>“What do I mean.”</p> <p>“You mean ... the first one,” she said. “I want you to fuck me again, but I don’t want to feel it,” she said.</p> <p>“Oh, no. That’s all right. I can’t hold back. I’m ready to give you one more chance,” I said.</p> <p>I put a hand over his crotch to stop him from pushing my hand away. I kissed over his shoulder.</p> <p>“If you really want me to be ready for my second time, that should be more than enough for me,” I said.</p> <p>“I'm still a bit tender for that,” he replied. “Would you like to take the next step?”</p> <p>“Very much! That would be great.”</p> <p>He reached over and pushed his fingers into my mouth, which I sucked as I put him away.</p> <p>“I think we’d better get cleaned up before I give my clothes back to the bar. I want them to be on before you come back down this evening,” I said and got up.</p> <p>I went into the bathroom with him. As I started to wash his clothes he pulled his head back. I was standing behind him with the water cascading over him.</p> <p>“If you don’t stop what you’re doing, he will have to fuck you first,” I said.</p> <p>“Oh, no, please, please,” he said. He turned around.</p> <p>“I wasn’t kidding,” I said. “My pussy is on fire with your cock on my belly.
