I'm sorry." His hand had disappeared inside the zipper of her skirt.</p> <p>"What?" She asked, her eyes darting to the back of the girl's face.</p> <p>He raised an eyebrow at her. "You got undressed, that's what." His fingers moved down her neck and onto her collarbone before returning to her top. "It's only fair to have a little fun with them."</p> <p>"I'm not sure..." she hesitated.</p> <p>"Don't argue with me," he stated.</p> <p>He pushed the top button and pulled it from the hole at the side with care and carelessness. She frowned, then he bent down as the skirt was lowered over his head, exposing the small piece of underwear, heft-hopping in his hands, heft-hopping out the bottom. He took it and placed it on the bed behind her.</p> <p>They looked at each other, confused until she looked into his eyes and then back up. He was holding the red material out to her while she looked away, then he looked at her again. This time she looked back.</p> <p>"You're very beautiful."</p> <p>He chuckled at her. The girl squirmed against the wall, obviously not sure if she should try to turn and face him. He chuckled again and she looked away. He leaned on top of her and took the thin fabric between his fingers and pulled it up and over her shoulders. She hesitated, then he pulled the flannel shirt over her head, she shrugged and looked away again. She stood there, naked, with her breasts barely covered, her pussy exposed. Her hair stood in a ring around her head and back, and he brushed it away, and she took his hands so that he could take her left breast in his right hand.</p> <p>"Oh. My," she said quietly.</p> <p>"And what is it?" he asked as his left hand moved over her body, his right moving up to caress her right breast.</p> <p>"T.S.A.S."</p> <p>"Oh," he said and kissed her lightly. She leaned back against the wall so that the girl could have a better view. "Are you sure you don't think I'm handsome?"</p> <p>She smiled. "I'm still a little shocked," she said, "I mean, I could never even wear half-dressed like this."</p> <p>"There's nothing to be ashamed of," he said.</p> <p>"That's too bad," she said, "I mean, I feel like I just have to wear my sexiest outfit anymore."</p> <p>"And how's this?" He asked, pulling the flannel over her head. She shuddered and her chest tightened as he removed it.</p> <p>"It's not so bad," she sighed.</p> <p>"Do you want to do something about it?" he asked with a grin.</p> <p>She nodded, her body swaying against him. "I don't know," she said.</p> <p>He turned them so that they were on their hands and knees. She had the look of shock on her face again before she looked up at him. He was leaning over at the edge of the bed with his hands under her chin and she could see his hands gliding over her neck and across her hair. She felt as though she were going to cry.</p> <p>"Oh. My. God," he whispered and lifted her. "Now get over here and take the boy off of you."</p> <p>"But... I thought..." she began to say. He kissed her and then pulled the flannel shirt off and held her against his chest.</p> <p>"No, you said there's no need to feel ashamed," he said. "I didn't say anything, I just helped myself to you."</p> <p>He caressed her hair, gently brushing it aside. "You didn't seem to like it when I started making you feel comfortable." She nodded her understanding but was unsure of himself. His hands moved again to run over her shoulders and upper back and his lips trailed across hers. She closed her eyes in surprise and then sighed.</p> <p>"I like the feeling," she said as he slipped his hands down the sides of her body.</p> <p>"You don't have to put this on, though," he pointed out after they'd been kissing for several minutes. "They're free places. They're mine as long as you keep them."</p> <p>"You're right," she agreed. "You don't have to..."</p> <p>Her voice trailed off as his hands slipped under her T-shirt and pulled it from her body.</p> <p>"Not without a bra," he said, kissing her again just as his hands came back to the front of her and slipped under the thin cotton.
