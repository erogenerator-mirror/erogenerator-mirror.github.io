I turned her around and we started kissing again. I felt her hand slide down to my cock. I think her hand was trembling as I gently pressed against her stomach. She gasped as my tip touched her mound.</p> <p>She broke our kiss and pulled at the bottom hem of my T-shirt and threw it over her head. I pulled my t-shirt off as we kissed again. She ran a hand down my bare chest and ran a finger lightly along my pecs. I was already hard from the anticipation of being with Melissa.</p> <p>We continued moving in each others arms as we walked, but with our hands all over each other. As we went towards the bedroom I pulled back the duvet. Melissa quickly covered us up and went upstairs. In the lounge we sat facing each other, still naked. I stroked her inner thighs and she grabbed my cock, squeezing gently.</p> <p>"Do you want to fuck my little slutty little bum?" She whispered. "Or should we finish what we started earlier and give her cunt a rest?"</p> <p>"Your bum is the best" I smiled as I ran my finger along her cheek. "You are one hot little cunt" I cooed as I caressed her outer lips and her clitoris. She slid down onto her knees and looked up at me.</p> <p>"Fuck me lover boy. Fuck my cunt. Fill my pussy with your huge cock. Fill my belly with your sperm. Don't stop. I want your fucking sperm to knock me into jelly" She was so eager for sex with me. "You've got a lovely cock" and she stroked me hard as I positioned her. I could feel the heat of her vagina and I wanted to get my cock into her again. Then I pushed my knob into her. "Are you ready for your first fuck?"</p> <p>"Yessssss" she whispered as I eased the full length of my cock into her. "Please put it in me. I want to feel you. Fill me with all your sperm. Don't stop. Fuck me lover boy. Fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck me" The room was filled with her moans and cries of passion as her body began to respond.</p> <p>I began to move in and out of her as she wrapped her arms and legs around me. Her legs were spread wide, almost as if it were a gift from God. She was meeting my strokes as we kissed. We moved gently along the wall and up and down. I held my body against hers, almost as if I were fucking her. All I could smell was her perfume and make out of her sweat and my sweat. She seemed so very close to an orgasm and I held on to her gently.</p> <p>"Come with me" she whispered to me. "Do it baby I need you" was all I could say. I pressed myself against her and just before I exploded the feeling of my load deep in her cunt was like nothing I had ever experienced.</p> <p>She pulled her hips up, pushing my cock from her. She stood up and walked round to face me. The whole room went silent as my cock softened. I reached out my hand to her and she took it, pulling my naked flesh into her face. Then she kissed me and I returned her kiss with passion and lust until I was totally spent and she had run out of air. We stood up and I started to get dressed. "No. Now I have to go and I'm sorry" she smiled, as she looked back at me.</p> <p>When we reached the bedroom she went back to my room and got changed. I went for a swim and then made myself a coffee - not hot, but hot enough for the mood. I went to my room and she came back down. I got her a cup of coffee and we sat down around the table to talk about all of the girls we had been with.</p> <p>The only ones I had met were the girls from earlier that weekend and I had been told that I would be going round on Monday and Tuesday nights. I told Melissa if she felt that way about me then she was all for my being in our circle of girls. The other girls were just a bit more conservative than this other girl. Melissa was the only to have been with another man and it seemed only fair that she could be on the same boat with me.</p> <p>I was sitting down to my coffee when Melissa came over. "So?" She asked. "Did you just fuck my little pussy tonight?" She gave me a sly smile. "Are you upset with me?" she questioned. "No. Of course not" I answered. "Well you did really well. When I asked you to fuck my pussy I know it was just another night for me. I think it's going to make me even moreâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
