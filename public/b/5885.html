Um, what if I do this?" she asked, turning to face him.</p> <p>"Like I said, it's all about your eyes," he said, smiling with a wink.</p> <p>"Um, okay."</p> <p>With that, he stepped up to the sink and started to wash dishes, turning down the hot water when he looked up from the counter to see her standing there holding the hot water.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" he asked, suddenly realizing where he was standing, trying to get his mind back on the question.</p> <p>"Oh, nothing really," she said, leaning over the sink to let the water heat up, trying to get a grip on herself again. "Just...just so you know. It's just your eyes."</p> <p>"Just be yourself," he said, his voice still thick with sarcasm. "It might be a bit distracting with your legs in your pants, but there's nothing that we can't do."</p> <p>"Oh, I don't think that's any fun," she said as she let her eyes roam the back of his as she shook her head and sighed.</p> <p>"I know. I'm trying. It's just that I don't want to do anything with my eyes because it's always distracting."</p> <p>"Oh, that's funny," she said, nodding in agreement. "I guess that will be alright."</p> <p>"It's okay. It's just...I..."</p> <p>"I just want a second chance," she said, and as he closed his eyes, she reached up and ran her fingers through his hair.</p> <p>"And I want you right here."</p> <p>She tilted her head and smiled. "You're right," she said, running her hands through his hair. "Can you see my legs from your eyes?"</p> <p>"Um, yeah, sure."</p> <p>She laughed softly and looked around. "You have such a fantastic view. I wish I had one of those," she said, putting one foot up on the counter next to him.</p> <p>He turned a darker shade of red, realizing she was right. He hadn't realized that she was looking down at him, so intent was she in her gaze.</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess. I'm sorry. That wasn't very...gentlemanly of me." He took a deep breath and cleared his throat. "Oh, don't worry about it. You're just like the rest of the world. You get caught up in it."</p> <p>She put both hands on the countertop, leaned over, and ran her fingers through his hair like her mother did back in high school. "Yeah, it's okay. I kind of get how you're looking at me. I mean, I try to look at you, I guess you like it that way, but..." She laughed, looking like she was having a serious conversation with herself. "It's just that I can't believe that you like watching me like this."</p> <p>She put her hands on the countertop again, leaned over and tilted her head up to look at him. "What?"</p> <p>"Well, there's the way you... you're like..." she said, looking up at him.</p> <p>"Uh huh. Like... you like a lot...you can't believe that I get you so hard at night, like that."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I...uh?" She looked over.</p> <p>"No, not at all," he said, still trying not to laugh. "I just mean, it's just, um, you're so beautiful, there's no way that I want to be attracted to you..."</p> <p>She laughed. "That's okay. I'm sure you will find some way to find out." She smiled and winked. "Hey, if I could go a few minutes without touching myself to make myself cum all over your face like last night, maybe I could get you naked, too."</p> <p>He was already blushing. "Oh, that could be pretty fun, right?" he smiled. That smile and that smile was a very sexy thing to watch.</p> <p>"Yeah, it would be fun." She laughed again, letting her eyes linger a bit on his hand. "And I'm just talking about you."</p> <p>"Oh, okay," he said, turning off the water and stepping out of the tub. "I'm sure glad to help you clean up in case you get cold hands, okay?"</p> <p>"I'll be honest," she said, stepping out of the tub.
