I could tell from his expression I was hitting the right spot, as his body began to tremble and shake as he began screaming my name.</p> <p>He couldn't take it anymore, and before I could get any more of that sweet feeling coming from his groin, he started cumming. My own orgasm had arrived too quickly, and it felt as if I was cumming so hard that I couldn't even hold it back any longer and it was pouring out of me in a stream that was more like an express train than a stream of cum. I let out a loud cry as this happened, then my body went limp as he continued to convulse on the floor below me. He continued to rub it into his cock as it continued to spasm and twitch inside me. I collapsed in front of him, gasping for breath and enjoying the afterglow of our lovemaking and the warmth of the moment.</p> <p>After what seemed like hours of post-coital bliss, I sat up straight, looked up at him and asked, "So, did you, um, um," and he looked down at me, nodding his head and continuing to stare at me through his eyes, "have you ever had a man fuck you?"</p> <p>He was blushing and looking me over, as if I could make him do something terrible, and he still managed to get some words out before I asked, "What kind of a man would you be if I said I liked the guys I was with and they went down on me??"</p> <p>He just stared back at me and laughed for a moment, and then looked down, and said, "Oh yes, you could find it incredibly erotic and you could be all kinds of wicked, but I really, really don't do that sort of thing."</p> <p>I started laughing again at his blunt honesty, as if to say the same thing. After a few moments, I leaned forward and wrapped my arms around his neck, and said, "You just haven't been to much of one lately, have you?"</p> <p>I was in the mood for a quick kiss, so I kissed his lips softly, and then pulled away with a giggle. "Oh no, that was not a kiss in the past," he countered with another nod.</p> <p>He looked at me like I was an idiot, "If you really want me to do that again, if you really don't mind, I would love to kiss you again, but I think we should wait a few minutes and then move over to the bed."</p> <p>My heart was now racing, for a few moments I think the thought of doing that again while we were standing at the hotel was enough to make me feel like a little girl again, just like I really was. He smiled again, and said, "That's very considerate of you to ask me like that, sweetie. Although it would be a lot bigger than that, I think."</p> <p>I nodded as we stepped out to the elevator, and we went to the elevator together. When the elevator doors opened, I stepped out, grabbed him and pulled him back into the elevator with me. Once we stepped off, I let go of him again, and we stepped outside out on to the street. He walked over to the curb and stopped to pick up his car keys, then pulled both of us back up to our car, opened his car door, then said, "I love you!"</p> <p>I just smiled and climbed into the front seat with him. "I love you too, lover," I replied with a kiss.</p> <p>We drove toward the hotel together again, and after a couple more minutes of walking and kissing and groping, we got into the elevator and we got out, and got into my car. As we drove to the hotel, he turned on the engine as he turned and gave a wink. I couldn't help but smile as we walked to the restaurant and started to eat. After a couple bites, he got a quick bite of his meal and then picked up his car keys. We walked into the restaurant and he put his arm through mine and we got into the elevator. When it came to the 14th floor on the 14th floor, we walked by the room and it was dark but I looked over at him and I saw a small grin on his face. I put my arm around him as we walked up the stairwell, and he turned me toward him so that we were kissing passionately. Our lips met and our tongues started dancing in each other's mouth, as his hand caressed my back and my ass. I let go of his and got out of the elevator, and turned around as he followed me inside the hotel and into our bedroom.</p> <p>After we got undressed, we got into our bed and he laid downâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
