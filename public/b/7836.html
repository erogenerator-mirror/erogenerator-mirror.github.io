He said with a smile, "The first time was awkward, and I thought I was gay for a long time. So I thought that now wasn't the time to apologize though I will always love to see you happy, which is why I am here for your first time. I hope that you enjoyed this, or that the memories we shared were worth the wait, because it was something else, much bigger."</p> <p>"I think it was worth it, you have done this before, and now you have helped me fulfill that longing which I have only dreamt about so long." She spoke to him gently. With that he moved on top of her and their lips met.</p> <p>As they kissed, they started to move their hands over each other and began rubbing their bodies together, caressing their flesh together. She moaned softly as her hand roamed his body. His hands followed her as they stroked every inch of her body, then moved lower to caress her ass.</p> <p>He pulled his mouth away from hers, staring into her eyes. As he kissed her deeply, he looked into her eyes and he could see that she was in tune with him. His cock was beginning to throb as he felt her soft lips press against it against his lips. His left hand moved down her back as his hips moved in to her heat. A moan left her lips as her sex opened for him.</p> <p>While her left hand moved to his neck, he placed his right hand on her right cheek, and gently slipped him into her sex. She moaned softly as he slid into her, then his body rested on hers. Their kisses became wilder as his shaft moved inside of her. She felt so tight that his cock felt like one large shaft.</p> <p>"Oh yes, oh God YES!!" she cried out. He felt her warmth surrounding his shaft as her legs wrapped around his body. His body moved in time with hers. As his body moved in harmony with hers, his left hand found its way down to her back.</p> <p>"Haley," he moaned, "I know you want me as much as I want you, but I also want to make you happy." He moved his mouth back down to hers as his hips moved in unison to hers and his finger found her left nipple. As they kissed he began pinching both her nipples as hers were pinching her other one.</p> <p>"Oh Jason, oh Jason," she moaned to him, "I want you! Oh god, I want you!" Her body seemed to shake as she realized that she was going to orgasm. Her body seemed to have turned into jelly, as he moved her body around for her first time.</p> <p>"I will take you," he whispered to her. He lay her back on the bed as he pulled apart her legs so that he could better see how wet she was. He leaned closer to her and his lips began caressing her inner thighs. Her hips lifted, wanting to meet his mouth, but did not want to yet. Her body seemed to be begging him to do it again.</p> <p>As his tongue found her sex, he heard her breathing quicken and her moans of approval. He pulled his long, thick finger from her pussy as he began sucking and nibbling on her clit. His thumb found her opening and slid inside her to find her g-spot. He moved his thumb slowly around the center of her pleasure. She started bucking like never before. As the waves of pleasure hit hers, her fingers began pinching her left nipple while her toes curled up and her head went back. Her body shook with pleasure for a long time. Her body seemed to be screaming to him to fuck her as hard as he wanted to and if she got a quick enough nap, she should be able to walk. But Jason was not to be denied. As her orgasm was slowly subsiding, he moved on top of her legs and moved her into a reverse position. His big, hard cock slid into her pussy as slowly as he could and felt the warm wetness around it.</p> <p>After they settled down from their mutual orgasms, he rolled over on top of her and began kissing her.</p> <p>"I knew you wanted me, babe, you were so tight!" He kissed her and moved his body over hers to look into her eyes. "I knew and love that you wanted me." He smiled at her as his hands moved to her breasts. He cupped each one in his hands and squeezed them gently, feeling her hard nipples through her clothes. He moved down kissing her face and down her neck to her right breast. He gave it a firm kiss and began caressing her breast with his tongue.</p> <p>She moaned softly and pushed her breast toward his mouth. His hands moved to the bottom of her breasts and he cupped them in his hands. He suckedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
