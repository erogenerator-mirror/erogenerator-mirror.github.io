You've told me about having to leave. What about moving to New York for the summer?" I asked.</p> <p>Trying to regain control of the conversation, I said, "My father has left."</p> <p>"Dad. Your father had to go and get his car to take me out of my mother's garage to New York."</p> <p>"What? What are you talking about?"</p> <p>"It was a very important move," I said.</p> <p>"But mom didn't take me, or take you."</p> <p>"Well, when mom had come back there was a problem. She had an argument with the school director and I knew that I couldn't trust her."</p> <p>"But we were both eighteen."</p> <p>"But she was only eighteen in the summer," I said. "And I knew a certain amount of damage must have happened. Now, if you will just give me a couple minutes and we can talk more."</p> <p>Trying to maintain confidence with my speech when I went to sit beside her, she said, "So your father left."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"But what did he do? What do you think he did?"</p> <p>"I don't know...maybe he just got caught in the middle of something, but I don't know. Either way, it wasn't worth it. I'm sorry."</p> <p>"So are you sorry now that your father's leaving?"</p> <p>"No. I would feel better if he had found someone else in the house that he could love."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I had thought you were good at things like that." She said smiling at the thought.</p> <p>"Well, I guess that we aren't the only ones that think that." I said with a laugh. This time was not going to be good. I didn't really have a choice in how I felt, but I would make sure that I did not leave this house unless I felt like it was safe. I decided that I would just give up and just let things grow. I didn't want to feel that I had no other choice. I just wanted to see if it was better to be alone and not worry about me leaving that way.</p> <p>She looked at me for a second with a puzzled look on her face. "What do you mean?"</p> <p>"Well, there was something really important that you had to attend to for that reason."</p> <p>She looked at me and smiled. "I don't get to do that all day long. You can start with dinner and then we can talk."</p> <p>This was all I could think to do. I stood up and headed toward the door. It was a little uncomfortable walking around in a bathrobe with a girl who looked like my sister.</p> <p>"I have to go to the market." I said. I don't think that my face showed any emotion. I was thinking that maybe it would be good for us to talk when she said, "Don't do anything that will hurt your family."</p> <p>That sounded like a good idea. I really wasn't sure how to respond to that. She knew my family; she always said so.</p> <p>I went to the door and opened it for her. She followed me out of the bath and we walked to her car. Before she got in, I put the bags down and turned to look at her. I was sure that she had told this story to get me to do something. As I walked to her, I leaned down and gave her the most loving kiss that I had ever experienced. I kissed her as a lover would kiss me, and I kissed and sucked until she was nearly screaming.</p> <p>I took her back to the farm and she told me later that she did not know that my father had turned it into something serious. I know that she did not tell me that this was the start of her family or that our father had given my family a new name, but I didn't mind. I was sure that I was giving her that much.</p> <p>During the next few weeks, it was always a little awkward until we met again. We had to talk constantly, but I managed to hide my nervousness from the other girls when we met. We had talked about being siblings and everything with me. It just wasn't that way until we did it again. We had had sex several times that week, and each time we thought that we would be able to go on from there.</p> <p>I would tell her that we were just going to sleep in the other room from the others so that we could have a conversation like with me. But, she always responded that we could talk about anything we wanted. She often got so loud that she had to go outside to deal with her friends or somebody. That week, she came across a friend that she had a friend in her year and that they were leaving this weekend.
