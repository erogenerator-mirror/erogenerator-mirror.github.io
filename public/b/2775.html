"I can't get enough of your cock!" she exclaimed.</p> <p>I was so shocked it took a moment of repressed and repressed emotion to get over her words, and that I nodded quickly, unable to believe everything that they had said. She slid the covers off, tossing them aside. They were completely naked, and I could feel my face redden, and my heart rate speeding up. And she was naked!? She saw me and grinned, standing at the end of the bed, in her dark bedroom.</p> <p>"You want me to come over to your bed now?" she said bluntly.</p> <p>I was more than a little confused (and very angry at her words). I just nodded, and she slid her dress off, stepping out of her shorts. I stood, mesmerized as she stood before me in her underwear. My jaw dropped.</p> <p>First, she was standing in her bra, panties, and stockings. Then, she looked at me, her eyes wide. "Am I really that hot?" she said.</p> <p>"Yes," I replied, speechless. "You are so beautiful!"</p> <p>"Am I?" she asked, leaning forward and grabbing my hand, pulling it to her waist. The soft touch was electrifying, and as soon as I touched her, I was lost, becoming intoxicated by this incredibly sexy older woman. Her hands were on her stomach, and her long fingers felt incredible in between her legs. I had so much confidence she might be naked, but my hand didn't care. I stroked the swell of her breast, and she ran her fingers through my hair.</p> <p>"Do you like?" she said.</p> <p>I nodded.</p> <p>"Would you like to be naked with me?" she asked.</p> <p>My eyes almost glazed over with desire and the sight of her body only made me more so. I moved my eyes downward once again, and her eyes were the same as when we stood before. Her lips were parted. "Do you want to see me naked?" she asked. "Or I should say, can I?"</p> <p>As I nodded, and she moved to straddle me, lowering herself onto my erection. God, she was good! The first time I had felt this intense desire, and it was now building deep in my veins. I couldn't think as she kissed me, pressing her body into mine, using her weight to drive on my shaft. I felt the warmth and dampening of her hair as she worked herself on me, her lips smacking my lips several times.</p> <p>It felt so good to be under her, so exciting and so natural. I didn't think, I just felt, but I couldn't imagine how she could ever be with another woman. But her hands were everywhere. She squeezed her breasts as she slid up and down me, her hand moving between her lips. My hips bucked up involuntarily. Her hips were hot and moist, and I could feel my balls tightening. Suddenly she stopped.</p> <p>"Do you want to take me to the bed now?" she said in a sultry voice.</p> <p>"Yes," I agreed, excited beyond belief at the thought of anything but her.</p> <p>I took her in my arms, my hands roaming over her back and butt, and I kissed her as passionately as I could for a moment. Her hands were everywhere, touching me everywhere, squeezing me. "I never thought I would feel this way with another man," she gasped when her lips hit mine, "but I have...I've never been with anyone..."</p> <p>I pressed my lips to hers, and she pulled away. "We will take this slow," she explained, "but don't take this time too fast for fear we will change our lives too much."</p> <p>For the first time, she looked at me in a way that spoke the truth. She pulled her dress over her head, and stood naked in front of me in her lingerie. "Undress me, Tony," she said softly, "do you want to see my body?"</p> <p>And I realized why. The first time I had looked at her before seeing her, I had seen her naked but for the first time in my life, she was still fully clothed.</p> <p>I stood and removed my clothes slowly, and when my shorts and underwear slipped down, I stood naked, in my bed. This was a change, I thought, my life changing. What had felt so natural the first night was becoming the worst thing in the world. It felt so strange to be naked and enjoying my own body for the first time, even when it felt so natural. It was scary too.</p> <p>"This is going to hurt, Tonyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
