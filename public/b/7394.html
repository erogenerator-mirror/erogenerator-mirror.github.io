He cupped both of my breasts in his hands gently squeezing and massaging them as they grew. I lifted them for him as he continued to fondle me, lifting my nipples to his fingers and rolling them between his finger and thumb. I closed my eyes and felt completely safe.</p> <p>I felt his fingers leave my breasts and he slipped between my legs gently touching the lips of my pussy and then sliding inside. I parted my legs a little to let him in further and again opened them wider. He stroked in and out a few times before suddenly lifting up his self and dropping back to kneel between my legs. He smiled and bent down and licked my juices from my wet hole. I could feel it on his tongue, his nose pressing against my pussy then he began to lick me like I wanted him to do it. My own tongue began to stroke my clit and his nose pushed into my pussy making me moan and push against him as he continued.</p> <p>He sucked and nibbled on my clit, nibbling it as his fingers continued to penetrate me and play with my pussy. At the same time, he used his other hand to cup my left breast and pull on the nipple. I felt my orgasm building and my body quaked with it as he continued to suckling on my clit.</p> <p>I felt my orgasm rising as I moaned my enjoyment and grabbed his head so that it could better drive his face into my pussy. My hand rubbed his forehead as he sucked my juices off of my hard clit. Then I felt his fingers as they slid from my pussy to my asshole and circled it. He slid his fingertip inside slowly while his lips worked my clit. When he circled it in his mouth, his finger slowly moved in and out. His tongue began moving faster and working my clit harder as he pulled me to him.</p> <p>I began moving against his hand and pushed against my hand trying to ride it. He continued to work my clit with his tongue, fingers and thumb until I exploded for the second time on his face. I felt like I was being pushed into the abyss, feeling as if I could go there forever if it ever would.</p> <p>When I calmed down, he kissed me on the mouth as his finger pulled from my ass. He stood and took my hand and led me to the kitchen. He poured us both a couple of glasses of wine and we toasted to my success. He held me close as he walked me to my sofa. I laid my head on his chest and rested my head on his shoulder. The warmness of his skin surrounded my ear and made me feel safe even though my heart was racing and my whole body so tired; we would have to hold each other as we drifted off to sleep.</p> <p>At last we began to drift off and soon I felt his arm wrap itself around my waist. He began kissing me all over my neck and moving downward. I closed my eyes and felt him run his soft lips along my shoulders, then down along my chest. He pushed his hips forward and his cock slipped through and pressed firmly against my pussy.</p> <p>I opened my eyes and looked at him questioningly. He pulled one of my hands from his side and placed it on his cock pulling it toward me so that I could reach it. I slowly wrapped my fingers around it. It felt so big. I loved it, but then I thought about what an old fashion cock might look back, in its own way, and remembered what I had been doing that night when I fell asleep with nothing covering me and it felt so good lying naked with him, touching him while I dreamed.</p> <p>I rubbed it with my hand, watching his face as I did and realized that his was also in reality. I could feel the heat of him and the wetness. I continued to slowly rub the head of his cock against me, pressing him against my clit, feeling the soft heat and warmth. I opened my eyes and watched him as he took his finger and lightly rubbed it against me, watching his face as my hand closed upon his hard prick. I squeezed my finger against him and then let it snap as it left my hand. He pressed his fingertip further down until it was just touching my lower lips where my pussy lips had spread themselves. He pressed softly back against me then gently lifted it from between my legs letting my hand slide back down along his stomach as he began to massage himself.</p> <p>He took a couple of more moments to take me in and then began to make his way towards me. I was now sitting on the sofa with my legs wide apart and his cock pressed tightly against me. He kissed me, his face close to mine. His tongue slipped between my lips and I tasted myself with it, as his finger ran back up along my lower lips pushing into my body. He pushed my legs wider, spreading them apart and beganâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
