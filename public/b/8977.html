"I don't think I would have the nerve to approach you personally. I would say you know how to approach someone. You will be interested to think about it."</p> <p>I looked at her questioningly. "Uh, I'd be more than interested."</p> <p>"Oh," she said, turning to walk away. "You didn't have to do that."</p> <p>"Are you?" I asked, trying to be helpful.</p> <p>"No," she said emphatically. "We're done. I've already gone out with a friend and met some guy she worked with, he's just moved in for the weekend so I thought I'd head out." She was smiling as she said it. "I was planning to wait on you anyway."</p> <p>I was dumbfounded. "That's so romantic. Are you sure you're ready?"</p> <p>"I'm sure, but I don't want you to think I'm being too eager." She smiled at me again. "Maybe next time don't rush." She was still smiling, but she turned and strode away.</p> <p>It was getting late and I wondered what my mom was going to say if I invited her back to my room to stay the night, or something in the morning. However, before I could ask she had already given me her address and telephone number and would contact her when I got there.</p> <p>Then I noticed in the corner of my eye. I suddenly had my own thoughts. I felt as if a big weight had been lifted from my stomach and it felt as if there was something that had been removed, but then she must have noticed the shadow, and at the thought of it, I turned away. I was hoping that she had not looked at me with anger or pity. In fact she looked kind of sad, like someone just wasn't feeling good. The rest of the evening went pretty smoothly, with me trying to avoid her as much as possible. When she got back, she sat on the couch, which gave me a great view straight up her shirt. Her skirt felt like it might be a little tight, and she had on some really revealing white lace panties underneath.</p> <p>I was about to tell her about her plans when she handed me her keys and told me to stay the weekend, then turned the corner and made my way to my room. As I opened her door, I immediately felt like I might fall down. She had pulled her shirt up so her stomach was exposed. I quickly slipped on some jeans and a flannel shirt, before I pulled my shoes off. I noticed she had on some pink-colored socks and sandals, and figured she must have put on something really sexy, but I took no notice for the rest of the night.</p> <p>About an hour later, she came downstairs, still dressed in her jeans. I didn't make eye contact with her or even acknowledge our presence. We left the building and walked to my car. She had made me promise to stay in touch, and we got a lift to her dorm. At first, I felt like we were going to start an affair, but just then she made me promise not to think about it. It was obvious how horny she was and she really wanted to get laid and I probably also wanted to get laid as well. I was too drunk to drive, so I did the math. I had to leave town and never return back to her.</p> <p>We did eventually end up going back to the apartment, only to find out our car was at the curb. We agreed to walk around to get to her dorm, which was also part of the complex. The door was partially open and we had to look it up and down. The parking garage had a lot of people standing in it so it didn't look out of place. As we walked down the elevator, she was right in front of me staring at me. There seemed to be a look of total shock and curiosity in her eyes. I just started apologizing immediately and pulled my shirt up as I kept trying not to make eye contact with her. We arrived at her dorm, and she knocked the door open and led me in.</p> <p>"Welcome, I'm Janice," she said cheerfully. "I hope you didn't think you weren't going to get laid tonight."</p> <p>I didn't expect her to do that, or not even realize that she'd done it until she walked by and looked me up and down. I knew I was in for a long day tomorrow and I was starting to feel a pang of sadness. Janice smiled again, a bit nervously.</p> <p>"It's okay," she said, turning to face me. "Don't worry; it really isn't all that unusual."</p> <p>I took it as she was looking at me in all that lust and desire and probably a little bit of fear. I had never considered it before but I knew it was something girls were more thanâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
