She felt very naughty and excited, but also a little scared.</p> <p>I had to be sure my partner wouldn't go too far too soon.</p> <p>"Keep going, keep going," she whispered.</p> <p>She pulled a bit faster and she felt her own body convulse.</p> <p>"You're going to cum," she hissed as her juices gushed out on the bed sheets. He continued to massage her clit and she felt her own orgasm rising. She held on tightly but also squeezed tighter onto his cock, which was now rock hard, in response.</p> <p>She couldn't take any more and she was ready to cum.</p> <p>"Don't stop, keep going," she called out.</p> <p>His cock grew bigger as she squeezed as hard as she knew she could. It was the last sign of his impending orgasm until she felt him tense, then as he pumped what must have been five or maybe four loads and she squeezed his cock more with one hand and brought it out as she came. His second load was even bigger, and it shot out on to the bedsheets, making a huge puddle of his semen.</p> <p>She felt him jerk and then relax against her body.</p> <p>The feeling of his semen on her was so erotic that she had started to come to herself. She felt that her legs got weak and she let go. He slowly withdrew his cock and lay beside her, both of them breathing hard.</p> <p>"I don't understand it but you have the most intense orgasm of your life." He told her.</p> <p>As she felt herself calm a little she asked something. "I never came so high with anyone, I would have thought I was dreaming," she explained.</p> <p>"I can't help thinking that you have an incredible orgasm."</p> <p>"What are you thinking?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't know but I can't imagine anything else."</p> <p>"Oh, is that all I've got?" she said.</p> <p>He nodded.</p> <p>"This is a lot of fun, but I have something else in mind too. Maybe you will have to give me a massage or something," she offered.</p> <p>He didn't want to and he looked down to his semi flaccid cock. It would have to stay there until he had seen her on the beach, which was just before he went to sleep. He sat up a bit and reached out and gently cupped each of her beautiful breasts. He cupped them and he caressed her nipples through the material of the dress. She smiled to herself as she felt the tingling of the nerve receptors that the sensation caused as he rolled the nipples and then rolled around between his thumb and forefinger.</p> <p>"This feels really nice," she said and she cupped his balls in one hand, his flaccid cock in the other.</p> <p>"I could probably do without this for a while," she said as she took the dress off, "it's still warm and I don't want to take anything off after that."</p> <p>"It does feel nice," he said as he lay back, "thanks."</p> <p>Then as she straddled him, he rolled onto his back, his hard cock pressing against her.</p> <p>She reached down to hold his cock and as she squeezed it, he rolled her on to her side as he lay facing her and stroking her back.</p> <p>She kissed him, as they shared a wet passionate kiss, "Merry Christmas too. We have a birthday tomorrow," she told him.</p> <p>"Yeah, that's a great idea" he agreed.</p> <p>She turned on her side and was now feeling extremely horny again. She took his cock in her hand, rubbing it up and down between her wet pussy lips. He lifted his hips, helping her get to his cock. Then when her finger slipped into his asshole, she came off the bed in ecstasy, "That made me so horny," she said.</p> <p>He raised his hand to gently massage her arm.</p> <p>She smiled, "I feel a sense of security knowing that I will be able to spend our time together. I've been afraid of meeting anyone, especially someone that I'd go out with or someone that I thought I'd marry. As much as I love being alone I feel the excitement of meeting someone that I would let go. I feel a very special connection with you now."</p> <p>"I have to say it, you are really turning me on," he told her.</p> <p>"I feel great too but it's all about the experience. I like doing it with you," she said as she pulled back the sheet and reached for a condom.</p> <p>"We can't do that here."</p> <p>"Why not?
