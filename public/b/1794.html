I pulled it back several inches, a drop of cum was resting there. It was so soft and silky I thought she might be able to feel me cumming. As I held it in place, her head moved back to look at me. She took a big drink of her wine and licked her lips. Then she licked the drop of cum off the end of it. I was starting to feel a little dizzy now, and she asked what kind of wine I liked.</p> <p>I took a slow sip of the wine and said, "Coffee."</p> <p>As she leaned back on her hands now it made a difference. She started rubbing her shoulders, moving up again and down. I poured her another glass and had her fill it when she took a drink. She poured it down as well. As she sat back up to sip it, I told her "I have to do a little something."</p> <p>With that she looked at me again, opened the nightstand drawer again, took out a condom. Then she took it out and put it on. She stood up and started to walk toward the couch. I said "No." she just looked at me and took the condom from me.</p> <p>As she sat back down I handed her the first condom, she rolled it onto her small cock. I told her to roll it down and she pushed the second condom and the third one in again. Before she started to put it on, her cock head looked so nice standing up.</p> <p>She said "I don't do this often."</p> <p>"If you're going to be wearing the same condom," I said, "Then you have to take it off. I'm not going to tell anyone."</p> <p>I told her to roll it down the rest of the way. Her cock was hard again and she was sitting back a little more, so I told her to lay down. She did.</p> <p>With the two condoms that she put on, I put my cock in her mouth and she took it. I started it and started fucking her again, she kept sucking and moaning, pushing me down. It felt so good. Soon we both had cum. The condom had been gone. Once I was done, I laid down next to her and we both fell asleep.</p> <p>I woke up the next morning, it was a cool day and we both were naked. I found myself laying down next to her with my hard cock stuck right between her legs and just up her little fuck hole, she was still asleep on my cock. We fucked as we slept.</p> <p>I didn't have much of a plan, I didn't know what to do, I just wanted to do something to make it up to her.</p> <p>It was early in the morning when we got up and went to the bathroom to pee. I had her stand in front of me, I reached around and cupped her soft tits and started to fondle her nipples, then I ran my other hand down over her clit. She didn't say anything, didn't open her legs. I kept fingering her, my finger making wet circles around her little clit. Then she said, "I can't pee anymore, I have to go to my room."</p> <p>The way she spoke it only added to the fact that she was horny enough to pee. I told her that was up to her.</p> <p>After I left for breakfast and she was off to get ready to go to work, I pulled some of the blankets back and let her go into the bathroom. As she came out, I noticed it was the first time she had been naked in about five weeks. In fact she had been naked as long as she wanted.</p> <p>I watched her walking to her bedroom, so she had gone to go shower as well and was just stepping around her landing strip and looking up at me. I walked over to her and she said, "How much of your cock has you got?" I told her there was nothing but mine.</p> <p>When she came out I saw her take a shower, but she went on a little longer than was necessary, the water was running down her body again and her hand was getting her hair really wet. I took my cock in my hand and rubbed it between her legs.</p> <p>She asked, "Did you cum that morning?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I did. I've been so horny all day. I have been thinking about you the past half an hour. I'm actually getting hard thinking about what the next two days mean. I got a little excited when you walked out last night, but if I say I'm getting hard from thinking about you.</p> <p>She went into her room and came out in her teddy and panties. We got into the shower. We washed each other, got it all down to washing each other off. When we got out and dried each otherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
