"It's so good to have you in your life, honey, I know it will hurt."</p> <p>A soft chuckle escaped from the other woman. "You poor thing. I'm so happy for you."</p> <p>Kimmie closed the front of the car, stepping inside. "I am. Now tell me exactly what's going on."</p> <p>Beverly smiled a bit, then turned into the passenger's seat and buckled her seat belt. "We've been talking about what's going on over the next few years with our new house and, now that this is all said and done, it's time, dear boy, to show all of us what we really need," she said, stroking a hand over her body. "As you can see, our little homecoming is in full swing!"</p> <p>Kimmie's breath drew in again, a smile playing across her lips. "I've missed you so, baby," she purred, stroking her own finger lazily. "Come on," she whispered, taking his hand from her, pressing it onto her bare ass. "Take us in your arms and take everything off."</p> <p>Kimmie reached to him quickly, bringing her fingers to his lips as he did. "Just keep those on my ass, please. I want you both to drive to the hotel before we leave. It is so important that you get there before my folks get back from the airport."</p> <p>"It's too late now," Kimmie whimpered, stepping back. "It's too late."</p> <p>"If you hurry, you're getting in the car in five minutes," Kimmie said, her legs trembling a little while he did. "I am so nervous."</p> <p>Kimmie was a little shaky in the seat, feeling so out of place with her skirt already hiked high above her hips, exposing herself askew, to the other woman.</p> <p>"You look so fantastic," Kimmie said. "The only thing that's going on in those two heads right now is we're going to give our new home a grand finale. You'll see me naked, Kimmie, and then I'm going to do you in every orifice you choose," she said, looking over her shoulder at the other woman.</p> <p>"Your parents are going to leave in a few minutes," Kimmie said, turning to look back at the other woman. She could feel her heart pounding and her palms were sweating as she reached forward, slipping her hand over and grabbing the back of Kimmie's hair in her fist. "Let's go!" she cried, trying to pull Kimmie's mouth onto hers. She could feel his lips press into hers as her body shook and her breath came in gasps.</p> <p>It was hard to find a man who wasn't shaking, shaking with lust as his hand roamed over her body. Her lips never parted until they were once more on his, his tongue in her mouth and his lips devouring hers. It was all the kind of passion she could ever imagine.</p> <p>Kimmie knew she could not wait to show her new home to those people, to do them the same thing. She needed every part of her to be in a room that would be open to her for hours. She also needed to feel her friends loving every moment she had, caring as she did for the love of her life while she was at home. Her breasts were bouncing against her bare chest and her nipples were erect begging to be licked and squeezed.</p> <p>Kimmie's hands had been shaking so hard that she thought she might float and was about to collapse in the seat when she remembered she was in the hotel. She took a deep breath and opened the door so they could get out.</p> <p>There, her friend and lover for all she was, Kimmie was standing with Kimmie fully clothed, their hands stroking each other's bodies, kissing every inch of one another's body as they were.</p> <p>Her mouth opened as if she wanted to protest, but she couldn't, not even as their hands wandered over each other's soft skin. Kimmie's hands found Kimmie's ass and squeezed it lightly as her lips found her friend's nipples and kissed them, sucking them and massaging them the way she knew those luscious boobs would.</p> <p>"Ohh, I love you, Kimmie," she whispered, releasing her breast from her own soft lips. "Don't stop," her legs trembled as she lowered herself onto the seat before her.</p> <p>"Kimmie," she moaned, kissing her way down the other woman's stomach.</p> <p>Her tongue was flicking over Kimmie's navel, pushing deeper and deeper into her bellybutton as she pulled at theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
