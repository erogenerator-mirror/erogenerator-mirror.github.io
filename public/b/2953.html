He knew she was enjoying it so he slid his finger inside her again and she moaned his name as he curled his hand inside her pussy. He slid a second finger inside and she moaned his name again as that long and hard, thick finger slid inside her and she felt as complete as she had felt all night.</p> <p>Just as she was sure she couldn't hold back another orgasm from him any longer, he pulled his fingers from inside her and lifted his head. She couldn't stand it anymore, her knees weakened and she fell to the sofa. She fell to his side and he slid his arm around her waist and rested his head on her breast. Neither of them said a word, except for a few mumbled words.</p> <p>She didn't know what to do. Part of her really wanted to go to sleep but if he would wake up and come back she didn't want her mother to see her like this.</p> <p>She felt him slip his legs under hers and she smiled and reached for her robe, she hadn't closed it, but it was completely open and she pulled it on and stood up. He did say she was naked, and he'd just seen her naked from a distance. He leaned over and kissed her deeply. When the kiss ended, she wrapped her arms around his neck and nuzzled her face into his hair as he did the same to her.</p> <p>When he stood up, she reached out and ran her fingers though his hair again. "Thank you." She whispered. "For everything."</p> <p>"My pleasure." It was almost as if he meant it and she felt as if she had known him forever and he had never left her body for her.</p> <p>"Mmmm, you're welcome." She smiled and he kissed her and then pulled her to him for another long kiss and she loved him holding her the way she was.</p> <p>"Let's move out." He said with a smile. She looked at him confused, but he smiled at her and stepped back to pick up his clothes. They both went to the bathroom for a quick shower and then he picked himself up in his arms and carried her to the bed. He laid her down and they both stood at the edge of the bed and looked into each other's eyes.</p> <p>"I love you." He said and they fell silent. At that moment, in the midst of just feeling, in a way that she probably hadn't felt in a long time, she couldn't have held back the tears that were falling.</p> <p>"I love you too." He leaned over and she closed her eyes as he kissed her. She sighed softly and he stroked her cheek with his finger, looking into her eyes, before he turned the other way.</p> <p>"I'm not sure I can even go back?" She thought, and the thought made her smile.</p> <p>"Do you really want to go back?" He asked, surprised, and he leaned forward and kissed her forehead. "No," she said, then added, "I mean, I really, really did love you."</p> <p>"I love you." He said, and just smiled at her again. "Now, is there a better place to keep going than to get your bath water turned off and to fall asleep?" He asked, knowing that they were going to do something like this again.</p> <p>"Yes." She smiled. "That's the only place I want to go. I just want to do it again."</p> <p>"No, I love you too. But right now, I'd like to start in your arms." He smiled at her and kissed her. "Let's get out of here, so we can go to sleep."</p> <p>In just a few minutes, they were both naked and kissing and caressing each other. They knew that they would be spending the weekend together again but they also knew that they'd let their relationship continue and they'd move on.</p> <p>But that wasn't going to happen. As her hands ran through his hair she thought she had once again been able to get him into bed and he wouldn't want that. But that wasn't the reason they had gotten into it so fast. She'd had to watch him grow up and learn how to please a woman, as was he too, and if he had wanted her to stay as well, well, maybe now was the time. Maybe tonight was the time after the wedding where he asked her to help him choose a lover to go with. It was the time for him and he wanted her to let him be with her. Tonight, they got back together. That was now all she knew.</p> <p>He got up and kissed her once more as he picked up the bath water that he'd found along the wall the other day; it was a lot cooler and he knew it would keep the water from chilling too longâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
