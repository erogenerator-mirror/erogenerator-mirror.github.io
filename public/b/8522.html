How may I assist you?"</p> <p>"Please follow me into the large sitting room. There, the table for an early breakfast awaits. Do you know of anything that may be required of you?"</p> <p>Tommy nodded and walked in the room. In the center, he saw a table at the foot of a single chair that had beaded covered in bright color and that was at least four times wider than his own.</p> <p>"Mrs. Thompson?" Tommy's lips twitched.</p> <p>In the center, he saw a pair of white lace panties. He had an idea. "Do you want what I can't have?" He said, his lips twitching again.</p> <p>"Oh yes!" She said, reaching into the drawer of the side table once more. She pulled out a small pair of thong panties as well. "Do you want to put them on? I can fit these on right now."</p> <p>Tommy nodded. "Okay, Mrs. Thompson." He walked around the chair to the back and slid the panties under his butt.</p> <p>"How do you feel?"</p> <p>"I don't know what to do...but it does feel wonderful."</p> <p>Tommy's mind reeled with possibilities. First, there were the questions; how could he bring himself to have sex with another man? Second, did he ever do anything? Third, why is he thinking of women all this time? Why is he still single?</p> <p>When he got back to the kitchen, Mrs. Thompson was standing naked in the center of the table. After a few seconds, she stood up and walked around the table. She had two small bowls of fruit, slices of bread, a fruit salad, and a loaf of bread.</p> <p>"Mrs. Thompson, would you like some bacon, bacon and sausage?"</p> <p>"Oh, no, Tom. You may not, if you would rather eat from the bowl, the food has to be fresh in the house." She put her hands down, showing off her long, slender fingers.</p> <p>His stomach lurched as she picked up an extra piece of fruit, and then a second piece. "If you say so, Miss. Please take one bite. Then, if you would prefer, another. I know you enjoy the taste, although you may not take more than a bite as it begins to taste bad."</p> <p>Tommy smiled. He placed one of the fruit into the center of the bowl.</p> <p>"Mrs. Thompson, please don't worry about the bacon."</p> <p>"Do you want some food, too?"</p> <p>"Yeah, Mrs. Thompson."</p> <p>"I'm not interested in the food, please take it." In a move to take another bite, she lifted her hands up to a small bowl in the middle of the table. Then she walked over to him. She lifted the bowl, took half of it into her mouth, and then proceeded to lick the cum off her fingers and fingers. She stood up and put the bowl back in the bowl.</p> <p>"I'm hungry, Tom." She took a step towards him and leaned over the table. "Put me in a bowl. Please."</p> <p>Tommy's dick tented his boxers. He knelt down in front of her. When he reached out, he slid his fingers over the wetness between her legs. He slid his hand under her and felt a pair of fingers that he had touched before. He heard her moan and heard her say something.</p> <p>He started to pull his hand away when she grabbed his hand and put it back on her crotch.</p> <p>"No, I want more." She whispered. "Now!"</p> <p>Tommy pulled his hands away and knelt down behind her. He felt her hand on him again as she turned around to face him. She guided him into her. She sighed when he slid into her and held onto his own balls on either side of him. He began to rock while they were joined. He felt his cock start to throb with each thrust and each pull at his balls as he continued to move into Mrs. Thompson. He let out a moan every time he pushed deeper into her and more as his balls were emptied. He felt himself nearing climax, almost ready to explode. It seemed like they kept going for an eternity. Neither of them moved. It felt as if they were completely connected as the rhythm they were on. When it finally ended, he slid out of her.</p> <p>After they had cleaned up, they sat in front of the window to collect themselves.</p> <p>"Tom?"</p> <p>"Yes?"</p> <p>"Could you please come up here to rest for a while?"</p> <p>Tommy felt him getting hard. "I'm sorry, Miss." When he didn't get another word out, he leaned back.</p> <p>"Mr. G."
