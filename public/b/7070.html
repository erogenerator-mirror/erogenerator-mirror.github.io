"How about you, Mary?"</p> <p>She was about to answer, but I caught her hand. I turned her hand over to the other hand, to the right so we had a good grip. I kissed her hand, pressing her body closer to mine so it was pressing up into mine, and then kissed her gently on the lips. She opened her mouth, and allowed me to French kiss her. Her cheeks blushed, but I could hear her breathing as she continued to hold on to my hand.</p> <p>"Mama's not going to leave us alone," I said. "And this time, we'll be together!"</p> <p>The next few moments of kissing, as I got my arm around her body, she seemed to really like the affection.</p> <p>"You have no idea, baby," she told me. "After everything you did to give birth to your family, and your baby...I'll never get tired of loving you, but this time...you won't feel this way if I stay with you. I want you to stay with me all the time."</p> <p>The kiss went on longer this time, a lot longer when I held on to her body for balance, as if we didn't know what was happening. My hands moved up to hold her cheeks. She was flushed with heat, her face had reddened, her heart was beating through her chest. A small smile came to her lips as I felt a surge go through her body. It made her body quiver, even though the kiss was still lingering. "Let's take a shower," I said, "or we can call it a day."</p> <p>"Let's get you upstairs," she said, "and then back to the bedroom." I led her back to the bedroom, her right arm around my neck, her left hand on my chest.</p> <p>The shower would have been the most intimate, intimate, intimate moment of my life, but this time was much more...a lot more...erotic. There was much softness to the water, yet there was also something more...intimidating and intimate. I helped her out of the shower, and then got in with her. I wanted our relationship to last for days. I don't think she even suspected my motives after what I had done. Once we were both clean and clean, I pulled her up against me and kissed her. She kissed me back, letting whatever passion she had left build up for her, and when the kiss ended, she wrapped her arms around my neck. Our mouths locked, as if we were made in the moment, and neither wanted to break the connection.</p> <p>I took her face in my hands and kissed her, sliding her down onto the bed and onto her back. I moved a hand up her body and down to her hip, and around to her waist. I found her hand with mine, and guided it back to my waist, and then lower to her side. The gentle brushing over her hip felt nice. I got back onto the bed. I kissed her again on the mouth, and she opened her eyes, looking at me for several moments. Her hand slid over to my crotch, where her fingers found my hardness.</p> <p>After that brief moment, I moved to her breasts, kissing them, kneading them, pinching them, and pulling on her nipples to make her gasp. I took a nipple into my tongue, making her almost throw forward. More wetness came off her center, and I slipped two fingers into her. She made a little sigh, and then looked up at me. I reached up for her breasts, and pulled them down toward my stomach.</p> <p>"We'll have to wash this," I said, lifting my breast up to her face. She held the sponge between us, and I used my fingers to spread it over my nipple. Then I moved back to kiss her again. I made her lay back, and I kissed the part of her lips that she hadn't gotten wet, then slid the sponge down, leaving a line of water. When she made a sound, I moved the sponge, taking it in between her legs. I kissed her all over, and when finally my tongue made contact with her, her whole body went rigid. She kissed back, hungrily, and moaned while her back arched.</p> <p>She opened herself to me, and I got down on my knees and took her left leg in the other. I was in my middle-eastern fashion, kissing her legs, her thighs, from her knees forward to her center, and her toes. Her breasts were hanging down again, slightly out of my way, with their nipples fully erect.</p> <p>She moaned again when I took herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
