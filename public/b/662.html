I had no idea what the hell she'd meant to say. I went to the bedroom to call again, but not before I'd told her about my wife's experience.</p> <p>For the rest of the summer, the phone calls kept getting longer and longer. I found out quickly that Carol had not come to see me that fateful day. My dad would stop by one day, he'd spend a few minutes with one of his old friend's wives, and then go home. Once he'd been gone for a week, he'd go home and find my wife sitting in front of the television watching something that was probably only a matter of hours old. Carol called me every hour from the phone, each time she said hello she was calling me back.</p> <p>I was getting tired, so I decided to hit the hay; I thought about just going to my mom's and making sure not to miss anything, but I quickly dismissed those ideas. I couldn't do anything, they'd be there to see it, so long as they didn't say anything to the kids. That was about it. I left home on Friday morning, went to the office to start my new business and sat around drinking coffee; when the phone rang.</p> <p>"Hey. Mom? What's up?" I answered.</p> <p>"I know, Honey. It's just that I didn't mean to put you on the phone, but I guess our little conversation with your dad and the kids took a detour. Have you been up long?" my mom asked.</p> <p>"Just as long as you're upstairs, Mom." I said, not wanting to give her any more ideas.</p> <p>"We really appreciate that, Honey. Are the kids due back soon?" her sister Jenny asked.</p> <p>"That's fine, honey, but I think they're having fun. I hope that Dad gets home before Mom-in-law wakes up."</p> <p>"He sure did, he's always horny. He really has a great ass! Oh, by the way, where is Carol staying tonight?" she asked.</p> <p>"Where is the house, dear? Did Mom and Dad finally call?" I asked.</p> <p>"They don't have to know. They can stay with us since we aren't home yet." she said. "Thanks for the dinner last night, dear. I think we'd all like to go. The kids are with Grandma." I said.</p> <p>"You're right. You made Grandma so happy! Thank you, by the way." she said with a huge grin on her face.</p> <p>Once home, I grabbed Jenny and her sister, left the kids in the den, and followed Jenny into the den. As we sat and chatted, the phone began to ring in the den. I listened and listened and listened. Jenny's father, who I knew had been away for some time, told her that Carol had come home sick but not to worry; he was home and would come by tomorrow, and would spend another weekend with Carol and be able to watch from his wife on his family business trip.</p> <p>Just as Jenny had predicted, my wife and I have many conversations with everyone, including people our own parents have known for years. We were able to talk about anything and everything that might happen between us. I always told her, "Just go for it!"</p> <p>As the phone rang, I could tell that it was my wife's mother, and she asked if they were alone on the phone. Jenny didn't answer, but she told her Mom that she had a surprise for me. Jenny asked if I was ready for more fun, and she wanted me to be ready. She quickly said, "I told you that I'd make you happy."</p> <p>I told her that I was still in shock over what she had said to my parents, but couldn't get over it. If she didn't have those presents, they could hardly come. I thanked her again, and again asked about the surprise. Jenny was very understanding.</p> <p>"OK then, you can take care of the kids." I said, still not quite sure of where she got it from.</p> <p>"It doesn't really feel like a surprise. It's all about you, Mom." Jenny said to me.</p> <p>There was a pause, and then she asked, "Can I ask you a question?" in a slightly questioning tone.</p> <p>"Sure." I said.</p> <p>"Is it always like this? It seems so strange, and I've had some weird thoughts about it, even thinking it was really happening just a weekâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
