He was holding her in his arms but it was not a hug, it was just a soft caress of hands and hair. She leaned back against him and closed her eyes enjoying the moment.</p> <p>"Honey," she said, placing a hand on his chest, "I don't expect you to go anywhere."</p> <p>"Good girl," he said, "Just stay and rest now."</p> <p>He turned, taking her hand and leading her to the bathroom. "It's late," he said, "I have to go."</p> <p>"No, wait," she said, as he closed the door. He had always wanted her there...her behind in his bed when he would go out to have sex with them...her tongue...even if he didn't know it, it was something he would never forget. He was a long time his friend's boy and he had never had a girlfriend.</p> <p>He turned to look at her and smiled, "Now it is late."</p> <p>"You don't have to go yet," she said, "the movie is on and I've got some free time. I'll call my roommate for us."</p> <p>He pulled her close to him and felt her hand reach out of his back to his chest again, but this time she pressed lightly and moved her hand down to his crotch, which was covered with a silky blanket. Her fingers danced deliciously over him until he felt them getting hard, "Let me," he said, "I have to do something."</p> <p>She put down her phone and looked at him, moving around until she was standing in front of him, "What is it?"</p> <p>He turned quickly and looked at her face, turning away. He didn't want to make her feel uncomfortable, but he had promised his roommates not to touch him...he had made a promise and now he needed to make it happen. She moved behind him and rubbed her hands along his shoulders, down his arms, over his hands and behind his head. She traced a finger along his lips, teasingly, "Shhh," she said, "no words, just relax."</p> <p>She ran her hands again down his arms as she knelt facing him. She took his ear lobe between her teeth and licked it. He was not surprised, he had thought his roommates would never do this and was surprised, she sucked on it gently. His heart pounded a little and she was standing so close to him. He felt as though she could feel his cock in her hand. When she pulled his ear into her mouth, he felt the slight burn of her teeth. As she sucked on his ear, her hand started to work, she rubbed it between her fingers, and gently pinched the side of his cheek.</p> <p>"I wanted to do this," she said softly.</p> <p>"Please, I want to."</p> <p>She moved her hands and pressed his body firmly to her chest. She could feel his hardness pressing into her and she squeezed him lightly against the hardness of his cock. "It's OK," she whispered, "we can't do it here."</p> <p>"Ok," he said, "just...don't."</p> <p>His hand found her face and his fingers ran over her cheek, pressing in slowly as she slowly tilted her head back, exposing her neck. He leaned down and sucked gently on her neck as his lips moved lower to the soft flesh. She felt herself get damp in anticipation. She tilted her head back her lips brushing up against his and she sighed deeply the sound escaping her lips. He was sucking her neck as he lightly caressed under her chin with his hand.</p> <p>As he moved to her ear, she closed her eyes and leaned her head back. She felt him lift her chin up and kissed her with a hunger that she had never felt before. He nibbled her ear and then sucked softly on it. His fingers were trailing down over her ribs, caressing around her stomach and then under her shirt. She felt it becoming difficult to hold back and she closed her eyes once again. She could feel her pussy getting wet. She started to move her hips in a small circular motion and she opened her eyes with her head still back.</p> <p>"Honey", he said softly. "Let me...put...up...a kiss...I...want" and he licked the side of her neck.</p> <p>He pulled the blanket away from her body. He was looking down at her and when he spoke, it was not a question but a command. She felt him lift her by her hips so they were together again.</p> <p>He reached around her and grabbed onto the blanket. He grabbed a handful and pulled upwards, pulling the blanket over her head exposing her shoulders. He then took his hand and started to slide it into her shirt back...slowly...just enoughâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
