I wondered how long it would take to get him to ejaculate before my hand could encircle him. I knew I didn't have to hurry or even stop him. I could feel my thumb in small circles inside him. As he began to breathe more heavily I looked closely up to see the little drop of pre cum on the tip of his penis. It turned me on even more knowing he was cumming with me. I thought I could see his cock twitch and pulsate. A few long seconds later I felt his cock shudder as if I had given him a small blow job. A couple long seconds later he finally let out a moan and I felt his cock twitch some more. I kept stroking softly until he had completely stopped thrusting.</p> <p>I looked up at him. He was smiling down at me with those big, brown baby blues. His lips were parted and his eyes sparkled with excitement that were matched by sparkling lust. He looked so sexy, so young and so beautiful. I wondered if I would be able to go through with it. I wanted to take advantage of this moment. I could only hope that I wasn't to late for my next party. I felt so much more comfortable with him than at any party. He looked as if he might wake up when my hand stopped its movements and I began kissing his lips again. What a wonderful feeling. I wondered if he'd be able to remember what his next session was like after that. I began kissing and fondling his chest as I felt his lips caress my breasts. He was breathing so heavy and so quickly. I knew that I made the right decision by continuing this kiss and making it even longer. I couldn't wait any longer...</p> <p>I broke the kiss and stood up. I had never felt so liberated that this feeling. I pulled him up. I gently unbuttoned his shirt and unzipped it. I pulled it over his head and tossed it on the floor. I looked at him and saw that his pecs were already hard, but there was only so much. I looked up at his eyes. His eyes were closed, he had a dreamless expression on his face, and I took him into my mouth. I liked the feeling of him in my mouth. His eyes never opened. I could barely see his body, but as I sucked and sucked and sucked my own tongue traced over his nipples and down to his stomach. I stopped sucking on him for a while and looked up at him.</p> <p>"Would you like to feel me up, David?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes," he said with a soft chuckle.</p> <p>I stood up and undressed. He watched with approval as I tossed my clothes aside. It didn't take much effort to pull my underwear down, his eyes and hands quickly glazed over me. He pulled my panties down my legs and lifted me up so that he could pull them off and toss it on the floor. He moved up between my legs and rubbed his hard cock up and down my slit.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," I said. "Make me cum David. Please make me cum."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" he asked</p> <p>"Yes," I replied. "I need to cum now. Please make me come."</p> <p>He grabbed hold of my hips and pulled me onto his cock. I couldn't believe it. His cock was long and it fit inside me very easily. I felt the weight of him as my pussy lips pressed against his pubic hair and my stomach. He began to move his hips but as hard as he tried he became lost in the sensation of that huge slab of flesh moving deep inside me.</p> <p>"Oh, wow," he said. "Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yes," I assured him.</p> <p>"You'll be glad you came to this party, aren't you?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Good. I want to watch you cum."</p> <p>My words sounded as if I spoke more than asked. He began pounding his large cock, hitting my inner spot just the right way. I couldn't help but let out the sounds I was making, almost growls of pleasure, of pleasure. Soon enough I was nearing climax, but I wasn't ready to cum yet. I pulled myself free and dropped my hands to the bed, knowing there wasn't much time for him to last. He looked up at me again, just as I reached that plateau I so longed for. There was no rush now. The excitement of feeling him inside me again, with the feel of his body against mine, was too much. I felt that if I got him to that point then I would be able to stay with him for ever! After so many years, I felt ready to wait.</p> <p>This couldn't happen now. I had no doubt about its inevitability. This was too good. I wouldn'tâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
