I need to rest now, so let's get to my bed, so I can sleep tonight, ok?" I said as I walked away, closing and locking the door.</p> <p>I walked back into the bedroom and looked at my naked body. There wasn't a single doubt about what I needed. I lay down and put my head down next to her. I took the handcuffs from her hand and walked off the bed. I got into bed and snuggled myself into her.</p> <p>"Thanks, you looked good in the nightie," she said as she kissed me on the lips. I kissed her back at the same time and I could feel her hand softly caressing the inside of my breast. I let out a low moan. "God, that feels good."</p> <p>I didn't know if she knew what she was doing to me, but she didn't seem to care. I had to admit that she looked good. She was still asleep and I couldn't stop staring at her. I couldn't keep my hands and arms from roaming all over her.</p> <p>I kissed her forehead, her nose, her eyelids, her chin and finally her lips. I let her kiss me for a few minutes before I stopped myself. I couldn't do that to her without waking her, so I let her kiss me on the lips and then slide my tongue in her mouth. She had to have known right then that I had felt her hand caressing my breast and her other hand on the outside of my ass.</p> <p>I couldn't have stopped her if I had wanted to. I wrapped my arms around her and felt her body against mine. Even on my knees, I could tell her tits weren't that great to squeeze all on their own. I just didn't want to ruin the feeling for her. I knew it wouldn't have worked out that way.</p> <p>I had to admit that I liked the feeling of her body against mine while we kissed. It excited me knowing that there really wasn't anything wrong in loving someone as much as I did. But I also knew a few things. One was that I had slept in the same clothes I wore yesterday. That made me feel naked, but I didn't feel that was wrong. I figured I had lost everything, and that was more important to me than what I had to earn. If I didn't earn her love, if I didn't find her beautiful and desirable and in love with her, then what was I to do with a naked body against mine?</p> <p>This kind of thinking, I know, but I just didn't want to lose her. She was amazing, she was sexy, she had an amazing body and I had a feeling she was just as beautiful and desirable as I was, and she had me feeling safe and happy in all that she had.</p> <p>"Are you all right," I asked.</p> <p>"I'm sorry about the nightie, but I just couldn't help myself."</p> <p>I kissed her neck again and took a nipple between my lips. I felt her moan. "Please, don't stop," she whispered. "Please kiss me again. I need you. I'm aching to be kissed."</p> <p>I went back to kissing her, feeling her hands caressing my body. "Let's get cleaned up a little before I put this nightie over you," I said, walking to the bathroom.</p> <p>I sat on the toilet to pee and felt my ass being rubbed for the first time in so long. It felt so good, so exciting. As the flow subsided, I had to wonder if I was going to lose her again.</p> <p>I finished my toilet and walked to the bed where she was still asleep. She looked so sexy lying there. I knew I would be hard for her. She just smiled and turned toward me. That was as good a time as any. I started to kiss her lips. She opened hers slightly and I felt her tongue inside of her mouth. We continued kissing as I lowered my hand between her legs.</p> <p>She was soaked and it slipped right in as my fingers found her clit and started to stroke it. I felt her lips part for me as I began to kiss down her body on my way. I kissed her navel and could feel her shiver under my tongue. My tongue started to explore her pussy. I lapped up her juices as I wanted to make sure I got her as good as she had been.</p> <p>I pushed my tongue inside her and found her clit. I kept one finger inside her, pushing up on my finger, but avoiding her clit. I continued licking her while I moved my finger in and out slowly as I pulled my tongue from her wet pussy as she began to moan and push her hips into my face. She tasted so good.</p> <p>I worked my fingerâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
