After just talking to you earlier I've been thinking about you too."</p> <p>I felt my face blush a little and said, "Well, thanks for being so sweet to me. You're such a sweet girl. Your Mom probably wouldn't have stopped even if it hadn't been for you."</p> <p>Her smile turned to a mischievous grin and she pulled me up into a hug. Her breasts flattened against me and she lifted my chin up, then planted a wet kiss on my mouth. As our lips came together, our tongues danced and danced and danced and as a groan came from my lips, she lifted me back up a little more. When one of her legs rested on the bed between my legs I wrapped my arms around her to feel her body pressing into me. I felt her arms slip in under mine, and I felt her breasts pressing against me, too.</p> <p>We kissed deeply, our mouths open, our tongues battling against each other. The sounds of our bodies breathing and moaning filled the room with our sounds, which were joined more strongly as both of us became more aroused and more excited. Her breasts felt wonderful against me, her nipples so much smaller than mine that I could almost see them through the material of her bra.</p> <p>Her hand made its way downward, cupping my buttock as it went. I could feel the firmness of her butt cheeks on my inner thighs as it rested against them. I kissed her neck, then down along her chin so that it rested against one of her breasts, then back up along the other as she lifted one of her arms and held it out away from her body so that I could suck on it. As I kissed there, I heard her moan and her hand came up to cup the side of my face. Our mouths opened again, more passionately this time, and her body pressed a little more tightly into me, her lips pressing into my neck as she did so.</p> <p>Her hands came up around my neck as she pulled it, her other body pressing against mine, her fingers running through my hair as she rubbed her tits against me. Our kiss, her fingers running through its length, grew more urgent and hungry. She pulled her lips from mine, then kissed her way down my neck to my collarbone, then into my cleavage, then onto my belly, and on to my leg, which she did not neglect as her hips moved faster and faster, pressing herself harder against me.</p> <p>I took a breath, trying to catch my sweet daughter's hot breath as it landed on my belly button, as we kissed and kissed and kissed. Her hot breath flowed down to kiss my inner thighs and her body humped me even harder. My own body trembled as her hot breath washed over it and then she did it again, as though breathing on it through the material barrier.</p> <p>She pulled one of my legs up, lifted it off the bed, and then pulled my knee out, holding it up high, so that I was lifted up, my knee in the air. Then she put her body up over mine so that my own knee was pressing back down into my stomach. She started to move up my body, her own legs in between mine, rubbing our bodies again, our mouths pressed hard against each other's, our lips mashing.</p> <p>My body felt so warm, I could feel the excitement growing inside of me again. It had all been my imagination, but here it was. We were kissing, sharing our first lesbian make-out experience. I could feel her lips on mine and our tongues were touching against each other like fire. My heart was beating wildly as her pussy pressed back and forth against my leg. We kissed each other and kissed and kissed and kissed and kissed each other until I could feel her body tremble a little and she started to kiss me more frantically, as she was moving herself against me more urgently.</p> <p>My whole body was trembling a little and I began to thrust myself up and down against her. Her breasts felt so warm against me even as they hung there for my viewing pleasure. I put my arms around her and pulled it firmly against me and she responded with a moan as our kissing became desperate and filled with our animal lust.</p> <p>I could feel the heat of her pussy heating up and the wetness inside of her as it rubbed against me and we continued to kiss with all the fervour we were feeling. The sounds of both of us in our mouths rang in my ears and I could feel my own breathing as I pressed my lips harder against hers, holding her with one arm and my knee between my legs, as I squeezed one of her breasts hard with my other hand.</p> <p>With one last groan from both of us, I broke our kiss and said, "Mom, I love you."</p> <p>She kissed me with more heat and said, "I loveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
