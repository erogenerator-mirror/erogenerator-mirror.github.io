"I'll make you some dinner while you're at the office..." she said turning on all the lights before leaving. She came back out naked, and said, "Let's go get ready for you."</p> <p>It took me no time to get into my clothes and followed her out of the bedroom. She picked out the short dress that I had bought for her to wear the night before. It was a sexy little number that was so cut on the front that it showed how little I had taken her to buy. When she opened the door, I knew what she had in mind. She led me out into the bright yellow front yard to the pool. The air was cold and humid, but she didn't seem to care. The air was cool enough that I had the feeling that she would turn it up a bit. The day was hot, and there was plenty of shade to cover me, but no one around. The breeze was blowing in and I found the feel of it to be quite exhilarating. The pool was huge, and I had been thinking about swimming for a while, but now I wanted to just jump on the side. My heart raced, but my dick remained dormant. She led me down the steps, not even letting go of my hand. She went down the steps behind her as I walked up.</p> <p>She had turned to pick one for me, so I had no idea what she wanted in her. She picked a blue one, but I could only follow her up the steps. Once she reached the pool, she tossed her arms down to the sides and pulled the top down for me. I followed her down to the hot tub, and she sat down on the cushioned seat across from me. Her legs were spread and her knees almost in the hot water. My dick instantly came up to full attention. She looked up at me as if to say, "You can come join us, but it would be too much fun if you were naked," and winked.</p> <p>I jumped on her lap before she could protest, kissing her deeply as she ran her hands all over me. I turned her head away from me and began kissing her neck. She moaned loudly and ran her fingers through my hair. I was getting close, so I pulled her a little toward the wall, and started sucking on her earlobe, causing her to press her body against me. Her breathing became shallow and I could tell she was in the midst of an orgasm but was fighting it back. She came back to reality as I let her go.</p> <p>She pushed me back and pulled her dress off of herself, "How do you like my surprise?" she asked, as she lay back in the hot tub and turned in half profile so that I could see her pussy, and it was wet and pink, and it was spread open for me to see. My face was inches from it. I leaned forward, running my lips over hers in a slow, sexy kiss. She moaned softly, "God," at which she spread her legs apart again and leaned her pelvis back toward me.</p> <p>I slowly moved my lips to her ear and started kissing the hollow. I could feel her breathing quicken as her pussy became wetter. I put my arm around her and started rubbing it against her. This was turning her on so much that she took my fingers and put them in her mouth and licked them clean, saying, "Thank you," almost as if it were an accident. I kept pressing my fingers against her pussy as I kissed her ear. She began to moan even more loudly, which seemed to drive me on as well. With my free hand, I continued teasing her neck. She wrapped her legs around me and pulled me close as I kissed her neck and collarbone.</p> <p>"I think I'm ready," she breathed in my ear. Her voice was barely a whisper and sounded so damn sexy to the other people in the nearby yards. Finally, she pulled my hand away and took my fingers into her mouth, sucking on them while gently licking her own juices from my finger. She then took it out of her mouth, put it in a champagne glass, and held it in front of me. "If I suck your fingers like this," she asked, "I'm all over you."</p> <p>I wasn't sure how to respond, but I did. "Let's do it," I said. I stood up from the hot tub, and led her over to the lounger by the pool. She stretched out on the soft material as I pushed her knees toward her breasts. She looked up at me a little nervously, but her expression said, "This is your choice, honey."</p> <p>I started kissing my way up her leg, and up her thigh, teasing her with lightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
