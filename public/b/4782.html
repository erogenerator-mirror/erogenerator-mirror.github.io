This was supposed to be romantic. If she had hoped to have sex with him she might have found it easier to get him into bed and to just fall off to sleep. She certainly didn't plan to seduce him on the rebound. Yet here she was. She had to know how much he hated to get ahold of her in the bathroom. She was a bit shy.</p> <p>She turned and smiled at him, which he smiled back with. He was a good kisser. She liked that in a man.</p> <p>"Hi, I didn't hear you come up," she teased.</p> <p>His lips curled up, and he grinned. "You look pretty good." A blush crept up his cheeks and his breath quickened, giving him away. He reached to place a hand on her waist.</p> <p>"Is it still raining? What took you so long?" she asked, leaning back against the sink, her back to him and looking out into the back yard.</p> <p>"Yeah, but it is getting better," he said. "If we stop by my place for dinner tonight we could always make love again."</p> <p>She shook herself out of an embarrassing tic, and turned back to the counter. "Do you really think I could come back here, if you would kiss me? I don't want to get you in any trouble."</p> <p>"You have no idea how much I wanted that. And I'm sure we could get together and have a good time, if it's the right thing for the both of us," he said.</p> <p>"I'm sure you'll like it. I would love seeing how you react to the kiss." After a moment he reached for another glass of wine and handed her a glass, which she took gratefully. "Thank you."</p> <p>"I am so happy you're having me over. Would it be too awkward if I stayed here and made out with you until we had to go to my place?"</p> <p>"Is that how you feel?" she said in a pensive tone. "I wouldn't have believed things if you hadn't offered."</p> <p>"I feel very confident when I'm with you. It's nice to have a girl friend with someone I really care about, even better when it comes time for you."</p> <p>"So when will I get my first kiss?"</p> <p>"I don't know. I really don't know. Maybe I should ask you, would you like to come over one evening and kiss me?"</p> <p>"Well, I suppose it wouldn't be that terrible," he hesitantly said, looking down.</p> <p>"Well, I'll give my first kiss to someone I care about, then I'll have to make my point and pick the next one. If you really don't want to, I'll understand."</p> <p>"Can I come with you?" he said hopefully, his face full of concern. "I really would like to kiss you too."</p> <p>"Okay. I think I'd like that," she said, smiling at him and then pulling the towel up over her head, letting it fall to the floor. "But that would be awkward. And I'll be here."</p> <p>"Can you stay?" he asked. "If you want."</p> <p>"Oh sure—and if you change your mind...." She kissed him on the cheek. "Let me know in a minute. I think I'd like to give you a proper kiss at least."</p> <p>"Can you come anytime?"</p> <p>"All my friends are expecting me to come, so I'm not going to let them be disappointed."</p> <p>"Okay. Bye."</p> <p>"Bye."</p> <p>"Bye."</p> <p>When she was on the couch, her head in her palm, she opened her legs and let the light from the street lamp slide between them and lightly touched her lips to his, which made the first kiss of the night deepen even further. She was pleased with herself for holding herself back, even if she had to take the risk of breaking off from him.</p> <p>"Wow," she whispered when the kiss had ended and they stood together, embracing each other's hands.</p> <p>"I'm so happy to hear that. And I've got great news for you..."</p> <p>They kissed again. His mouth moved along her hair, then down her neck and upper chest. He gently pulled the towel away, revealing her breasts as he lowered his lips down to one of her erect nipples.</p> <p>"Hey," she whispered, breaking the kiss.</p> <p>"I feel bad about that," he said. "It's all too sexy for me to think you would be madly in love with me."</p> <p>"Don't worry," she said. "And as if he wasn't enough to satisfy you, I'm going to give him a real treat when we get there.
