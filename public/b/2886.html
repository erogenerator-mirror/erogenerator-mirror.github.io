If you feel he wants some dick, don't be shy – you are in charge.</p> <p>But, at the moment, he didn't need a dick to satisfy his lust.</p> <p>His cock was growing and getting larger, more engorged. His pre-cum was a lubricant and his skin was wet and shiny. And the head was shiny and purple. His body had all its muscles tight. He was breathing hard. It felt good to have control over his senses. To be able to feel the power of an animal – a man in need, control it, control it – and it would soon be unleashed.</p> <p>"Are you ready, Baby?" a voice said, and the man who'd been kneeling by the bed let his erection spring out from under the sheet on one of its downward strokes. The man had been watching and playing with it, and knew its true form. All it needed was a quick jerk.</p> <p>"Yes," the guy said, "But please don't give it to me."</p> <p>It was hard to believe, even now, that a man's cock was actually attached to a well-defined set of muscles.</p> <p>"Ohh fuck yes, Baby, I know I'm ready, baby," the man said as the man's cock started to lift.</p> <p>So, the man moved down onto his calves, lifted them high, and wrapped them up with his arms, so that he was sitting on his knees. The guy's legs went up and back, and then out, leaving him high enough to lay his legs in the air and hold his legs up. His erection was straight and thick. But still he had not been given permission to touch it. So, the man let him fall back, and his hands were free. He felt his legs being lifted, and he saw that his own cock was waving in front of his eyes.</p> <p>"Oh my," he gasped, "Oh yes, Baby. It's so big, Baby. Your own cock doesn't feel so big. It seems to fill me up. Come on, Baby. Fuck me, you are so hot. I need you. Give it to me." His excitement was in full-fledged battle.</p> <p>Suddenly it was over. The cock was gone, and the balls was pulled out from under the tight sack. He heard the zipper as the man's fist slid under the sheet. Suddenly, both of them lay on their sides, one with the other on the bed. He kissed his chest and face – the lips were cold and chapped. They were both warm and smelled sweet, and knew how this must feel. When they were both ready, the man lay on his back, legs on either sides of the other and held his legs high.</p> <p>"OK, Babe. Just put it in," he said.</p> <p>He lifted the ball sac and found two orbs. Both filled up. They were as thick as his hand and both were just a tiny bit over-full. He knew, without knowing it, one of his own had grown too. He felt the tight balls under the hairy sac, and as he pushed the one up and down, the other pulled a little. The whole length was wet. And the heavy weight of it moved.</p> <p>He couldn't help thinking, "Oh yes, Baby. Your balls will be heavy. It will feel right."</p> <p>He rolled a little on his leg and lifted it. He was sure, because he'd just had a blowjob, that his balls would be in his hands. He felt his own cock at the head, and he started pulling on them. It felt wonderful. He heard the man tell him, "Oh yes. You have got to make one more, Babe. Let me feel you."</p> <p>The man had pulled the balls up a little to the base and was lightly pulling, and the man had a strong grip on that spot that gets you hard and swollen.</p> <p>They both heard the man say, "Yeah, like that, Honey. Oh God. It feels so good."</p> <p>It felt different, somehow, and it was feeling good at this moment, not aching the tension from the balls, and as their chests pressed into each other, they were both in a higher state of pleasure, both of them in a trance of pure physical pleasure.</p> <p>"Yeah, Baby, that's good. You like that way, Baby." It felt so good to him. "That cock, it feels good to you, Honey," the mans voice said. "Yeah, fuck it. That's how it's supposed to feel."</p> <p>Their chests were crushed, and he could feel their breasts against his own. Their lips were a little too close, but it felt good to be able to kiss. His hands were around her and they could each feel the man's erection on his own chest.
