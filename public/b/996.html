Her eyes looked to be as brown as the rest of her face; her hair and face were slightly dishevelled, and her chest heaved.</p> <p>"Can you hear me?" I asked.</p> <p>"You do understand, don't you?"</p> <p>She replied, "Yes."</p> <p>Then she raised the glass to her mouth and she tilted it up to me.</p> <p>"You are going to have to do it," she said simply.</p> <p>I nodded to her and then I put my glass down and turned to look at her again and then I took a good long drink of my Scotch whisky as we both drank our whisky thirstily.</p> <p>After a while we turned to look at each other again and once more, it was the same expression of pure and unadulterated lust that she had on her face. Our bodies were both responding. We both needed to be released. This was what we had been waiting for.</p> <p>I raised my glass and she said, "Shall we go?"</p> <p>So we went to bed together and I made love to Alice with my hands and mouth. By then she had both of us to whom the needs were greater and our hands were busy doing many more things to our bodies simultaneously.</p> <p>I loved her. She had the most beautiful face, the most sexy body, the most fantastic breasts and the most amazing breasts. All her body and every inch of its curves belonged to me. But it was her face that had so attracted me; it was her eyes that had made my heart beat so hard that it felt as hard as stone. She was the best, the most beautiful thing that had ever been in my head...</p> <p>I must have fallen asleep next to her on a Sunday morning. I was already feeling so much contented from what we had done, and I could tell that Alice was feeling the same thing, not even being as randy as I had thought she would be.</p> <p>I was happy; all my troubles had been swept away from me, from my mind. It was only a fantasy; not something that I had ever imagined to even contemplate but that I was now going to have to live with.</p> <p>My thoughts drifted back to that wonderful night and to the fact that I wanted to be her lover. A lover who would not be able to resist making love to every part of her naked body. I felt very good having Alice as my companion with whom I could make love to her without guilt. There was no turning back - no way that I could ever do that, not with Alice. I was her husband - her slave!</p> <p>As I watched her undressing she was totally naked, which seemed to have an effect on her. She let the clothes drop to the floor and she bent slowly to take my half erect cock with her mouth and she was so sexy when she was like that. Her breasts moved delightfully under her and her skin looked as beautiful as the rest of her body.</p> <p>She took my cock in one hand and used her hands to get my cock as close as she could. She slid first one, and then two fingers past her labia into her pussy. She stroked her clit gently, then she started masturbating with her fingers. It seemed natural to me to be here for the very first time.</p> <p>Her pussy was as inviting as I remembered and there is never enough light in the house to see how she looked in her naked state. The bed had made a high contrast in colour, making it look even more like the white one that I had used in the shower. It was soft and smooth. We both got wet as I washed my wife and made love to her.</p> <p>Alice is a woman who is really turned on by sex -- it's difficult to have more than one orgasm and then, if you have it, only just stop, just hold it and hold me there. She made me wait for hours to get my answer. Once she had let loose a big load of sex honey in my wife, she had me get out of the shower again.</p> <p>Her hand and fingers continued to work on her pussy and she didn't come in seconds. She lay on the bed with her face up on the pillows and I was on my knees between her legs, my head resting on her thighs so that my face was next to hers. She didn't say anything but I knew that this was to tell me what she wanted.</p> <p>I knew that it had been to be the last time we were ever alone together, and what we did together had never happened.</p> <p>"Can we do it again?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes?" she replied.</p> <p>"Please," I saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
