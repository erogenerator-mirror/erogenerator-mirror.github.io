We just need to stay in each other's arms to get the blood flowing." I had been sitting on my back and I could feel her moving. She was on my side facing me. She began to rub my arm. "How long will we stay together?" she asked softly. I hadn't thought about that, but for some reason I could't bring myself to tell the truth. She slid me closer on the bed. She moved to the center of the bed and put her lips on mine. With my arms over her head, I could feel some tension returning. She broke our embrace and slid her body down. I was lying on my left side, staring up at the ceiling.</p> <p>"Don't you want to know?" I felt her hand slide over my cock. I couldn't think of a single thing to say. "Go on, I have a question to ask you."</p> <p>"Sure," I said finally. "Go ahead. What?" She began to slowly stroke my length. Her hand moved slowly over the length. "Is that a cock?" She looked at me questioningly. I realized then that she must be in some kind of trance, that if it wasn't for what I had just experienced, I probably would have been as hard as a rock. "I mean, it is hard"</p> <p>"I mean, does that mean it's true about you?" She didn't blink, just kept her eyes looking at my hardness. I nodded, not able to speak. I had wanted a blowjob from years ago, but I had never gotten one. She looked at me, smiled and asked with a bit of mischief in her eyes,</p> <p>"Is that what you've been dreaming about?" I could feel her breath coming in my ear. I knew instantly, that she would do anything to make me feel good. I didn't have to make any effort. My cock was ready for her. "I'd even like to suck your dick" The question caught me by surprise. I was having some trouble talking again. She laughed at me and continued to stroke my cock. I was speechless. My words caught in my throat. Her hand didn't speed up at all. It was so innocent. "Do you want it?"</p> <p>"Oh god, yes," I moaned, "I want it in my mouth, all the way." She leaned over and kissed me. I didn't know what was happening at that moment, but it felt like she was licking my lips and sucking on them. She took both my hands and placed them on her breasts. I felt her soft flesh against my palms. I had fantasized about it ever since I was in high school. My hands slowly massaged each firm breast. It felt like I had touched my first nipple. She leaned down and kissed me hard again, as she pulled herself away. "God, you really turn me on," she said with a soft grin. She took my hand and placed it on the softness of her stomach. Slowly, with her arms pinned against the bed, she pushed the rest of my hand up her skirt.</p> <p>"Oooh," I gasped, "I can't believe you're wearing hose." I looked at her face, which looked like a cat. She took my other hand and placed my hand on her pussy. I found out later she had been wearing panties since we began this little adventure, but, she left that out of it. "I bet it feels good," she sighed with a sexy laugh. She took my hand.</p> <p>"Oh yes it feels good, it's wonderful." I began to rub her pussy. She raised up on her hand and pulled my head between her legs. I could smell her. It was all I could do to keep from licking her pussy. She pressed my forehead against her thighs and closed her legs around my head.</p> <p>"Oh my god, oh god, oh god." She cried for some reason but, all I noticed was her breathing. It didn't stop, but instead, it was more and more like, oh god, she was moaning with it. I moved my head to catch her pussy with my lips. I licked her clit quickly. It was so hard. She groaned and began to buck under my hand on her pussy. She pressed my head into her a little harder as she came on my lips. She was coming for almost 15 minutes. As she caught her breath, she smiled at me through her eyes. She opened her mouth, showed me her tongue and kissed my forehead. "I love you." Again, all I wanted to do was kiss her. But she didn't move so I kissed my way up her body, kissing her chin, neck and ears. As I got to her breasts, I kissed her shoulders and the hollow of her neck. I kissed her earlobe and ran my tongue over it.
