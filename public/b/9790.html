I asked.</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"Did you take off my clothes?"</p> <p>"In a heartbeat."</p> <p>"You okay, Nick?"</p> <p>"Yeah, yeah, keep going."</p> <p>I was having a great time too. I knew, as usual, that this was going to be hot. I could feel the heat all through my body. The sun had set, but there was still quite a bit of cloud outside and the temperature had risen. I could feel the humidity of the cabin heating my legs and my body. I could still feel warm water running over me in the water. It was warm, but I knew, under different circumstances, a bit nicer.</p> <p>"Oh, God, Nick..." I heard him moan and it was like a bolt of pleasure ran through me and through my body. It seemed to go on endlessly. It felt like a part of me could turn into someone else entirely. I had only the one dream that I was feeling at that moment, and it was definitely the most powerful sex I had been in in years.</p> <p>"It's okay, Nick. I'm okay. I'll go shower and get ready for you."</p> <p>"No! Don't." He was almost begging me. He just wanted to please me, please me with his body.</p> <p>"Of course I will," I said before I really got very far. "Get dressed and we'll go get started."</p> <p>"No! You're not taking my virginity."</p> <p>"Shh," I told him. "It's ok. I still feel safe, you don't have to do anything you don't want to."</p> <p>We walked towards the door and he stopped me. He didn't want to go through the same nightmare again.</p> <p>"I won't," he said quietly.</p> <p>"Don't be ridiculous," I told him. "You're not going to take my virginity this time."</p> <p>He took a step closer and was now right in front of me. My face fell. I'd never done this before, and now I felt like I'd been slapped and even if it was a very powerful feeling, this was the way I'd come to feel.</p> <p>He grabbed my left wrist and lifted it up as far as I could reach. Then his hand dropped. He put the index finger of his hand against the fleshy part of my wrist just under the cuff chain.</p> <p>"Put your hands back on the bed," he told me calmly, "right now."</p> <p>He pulled my hands over my head and over my head, making sure to touch the collar bone. My wrists were held at their cuffs above my head, and I felt him unzip his jeans, then move his legs apart and kneel between them. He grabbed my hair and pulled my head back, which made the collar chain, and the chain that hung down from my head, pull on my hair as well.</p> <p>A little of the pain radiated from his hand on my head as he forced his body to the side and onto the bed. He moved behind me, then knelt on the bed, pulling me off the bed. He kept pulling me until the headboard was against the wall. The bed was only two feet from the floor. My ankles, wrists and collar had to be stilled out by now. My legs were pulled up higher and farther up the bed. I wanted to put one leg on either side of the bed. My head and wrists were spread wide.</p> <p>I could feel the bed moving as he got closer. My knees were forced forward, and I had the bed up to my shoulders. He was standing right in front of the bed, my hands bound to the bed above my head. I couldn't move my arms. They were trapped against the bed and my head was held in the air.</p> <p>Suddenly I felt the collar being pulled off of my neck, it was so soft and cool. A moment later, as I felt the collar being tightened, I realized that the collar chain was moving against my neck so very gently.</p> <p>"What are you doing to me, Nick?" I asked, barely above a whisper.</p> <p>"I'm just going to hold you for a bit while you're being tied up. That will keep you still and you'll think long enough for me to finish," he told me, "so you don't try and get away."</p> <p>He pulled my arms up and off of the bed. He used the rope to tie my wrists around the cuffs. Then he pulled a short length of rope up to my hips and tied it off, leaving the other end of the rope tied to the bottom of the bed.</p> <p>I felt him then pull the end of the rope up from my hipsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
