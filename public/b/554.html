She whispered.</p> <p>I said, with a laugh, "I think it's hot!"</p> <p>"I think it's hot too," she said.</p> <p>"Well, I really enjoyed our time together that first time." I said.</p> <p>She got that look, her eyes looked wild, like she really enjoyed what she was doing to me. I looked at her again and said, "You have no idea how long you stayed up, dancing naked."</p> <p>She got me up and led me into the other room, by the hand, to where she set her purse down on the table on the other side of the glass door.</p> <p>The party was pretty busy except for a couple couples going through the door when we passed the bar.</p> <p>"Don't forget to close the door on that, will you?" I said.</p> <p>She did.</p> <p>"And one more thing, you look like a really attractive lady."</p> <p>"Thank you, Jack."</p> <p>I said. "So I didn't hear anything that night."</p> <p>She leaned in and kissed me.</p> <p>I said, "So have a nice evening, Mrs. Anderson."</p> <p>I gave her a kiss as I said, "I think we'll make a lovely couple."</p> <p>I stood up and walked towards the door. She stood right there, with a big smile on her face. She was beautiful. I told her that the party was over and the rest of the evening was just a matter of getting ready for the next round of drinks at the buffet.</p> <p>The second round of drinks was a big success.</p> <p>As we came out from the dance floor we noticed that almost everyone had left and no one was taking the seats. One or two folks were having some drinks and the guys sitting at the other table were on the dance floor and enjoying quite a bit of dancing.</p> <p>We headed back into the room, toward the bar, and when we got there, a tall dark skinned man was standing at the bar.</p> <p>"Would you like some wine after the party and maybe a beer?" the guy asked us, handing us two wine glasses.</p> <p>"Sure!"</p> <p>"Sure." I said, picking up a bottle of vodka to have opened while sitting down.</p> <p>"This is nice. It's not all about the dancing, but everything seems to be just good." I said.</p> <p>"Let's get to it." He said, and took us out to the dance floor, where he began to dance very seductively.</p> <p>I got pretty hot, as he moved his body very close to mine, brushing it every which way in every position. I could feel his cock rubbing up and down between my legs, so hard and long. I noticed that he was getting quite aroused.</p> <p>When the song changed, he moved his hand to my shoulder and he moved it downward until he reached my ass. I felt a large bulge and felt a twitch in my own cock, which in turn made my heart beat a little faster. I looked at him, and he smiled, clearly enjoying the dance and the affect he was having on me. A very beautiful man. The guy I've fantasied about for 18 years got me to a point I'd never reached.</p> <p>He continued to dance with me, sliding his hand underneath my shirt, under the elastic of my pants, rubbing up and down on my cock, which was very hard now, even in those pants.</p> <p>"Let's go back to the table." He said, leading me back to the table, where the two of us sat for about 30 seconds or so.</p> <p>One of those conversations that occurs between lovers about a good time is a huge turn on for me.</p> <p>The conversation turned to our sex life.</p> <p>"I've been with plenty of women over the years. I really need a good time, a real good time, and I really want to get a real good hard cock in my pussy. Now this man is great."</p> <p>He looked at me coyly and said, "I just wanted to play the part, in case you want to try."</p> <p>I saw him getting turned on, probably because he had an obvious bulge in his pants. He was moving his hand very quickly now, all about, rubbing up and down the length of my long leg. In addition to that we were both breathing heavy already and it was a very sexy atmosphere.</p> <p>He finally looked at me and winked and said, "I think that's it, then?" He stood up and took my arm to guide me back to the table.</p> <p>"I'll take him back to the bar." He said, smiling.</p> <p>When we got back to the table, he turnedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
