He said, rubbing the pad of his middle finger around it for emphasis.</p> <p>"Really? Can't afford some of those?" she asked.</p> <p>"That's why he's doing it for me."</p> <p>She was looking across the table at him again. "Oh..." she shrugged. "Yeah, I guess..." she shrugged again. "But...he's still a man. He's just...different..." she said, looking like she was trying to figure it all out.</p> <p>"What?" he said, smiling at her.</p> <p>"I can change...if you like...I'm just gonna..." she said, her eyes going from his face to his eyes again. "I can't say. I still like him, but I don't think I'm ready to face the music." She looked down, looking her hair for a while. "But it's a deal." she said. "I got to admit, it seems like he does kinda fit in here." she added. "He's different and...different, I'm sure of it. It's not as if he really likes the idea of being dominated."</p> <p>"How can he be dominant, Ms. Jenson?"</p> <p>"He's...I dunno, different. He's more of a...I don't know...like you." She said. "He's not...or doesn't have the confidence to really do it to me."</p> <p>"You have confidence to do that?"</p> <p>"I suppose, sort of!" she said. "But...he does like you. So that's pretty special."</p> <p>"And you're pretty smart." he said.</p> <p>"Oh...so you're gonna...do this?" she said.</p> <p>"Of course!" he said with a smile.</p> <p>"Good!" she said. "Because...I'm tired of these..."</p> <p>"What if we just go to the motel?" he asked.</p> <p>"Maybe," she said.</p> <p>"Or....?" he said. "If we go out again. I'd like to get to know you better..."</p> <p>"I'm really tired of that," she said, her eyes going from his face to his hands. "It's a long story."</p> <p>"Okay," he said.</p> <p>They finished their dinners and he paid for them for the day. They went to the motel room together. They were on their second date and still hadn't had sex.</p> <p>She sat against the wall to his left and they both kissed when the door to the motel room opened. He took her, guiding her against the wall, their legs tangled together. He dropped to his knees, pulling her dress with him as he kissed her again.</p> <p>Once they had both had themselves undressed, he moved them over the chair next to the bed and leaned her onto it. He started kissing the side of her neck, biting lightly there. He trailed kisses across her skin as he felt her body shiver.</p> <p>He pulled her dress up and cupping her breasts, she felt free. His hands ran over them, squeezing her and then squeezing, his fingers stroking her nipples until she was moaning.</p> <p>Finally, he pulled away. He stood, looking down on her. Her eyes met his, they smiled, but they held a promise. Without a word, he turned around and walked toward the bed.</p> <p>"Are you sure you're okay, Ms. Jenson?" he asked her.</p> <p>"Definitely, I'm good."</p> <p>"Yes, I'm sure." He said. "I won't forget."</p> <p>"Oh...really??" she asked.</p> <p>"Yeah." he said.</p> <p>"Oh!" she said, her eyes going in the direction of his face. "I don't know what's wrong with me, but I like it. Don't you?"</p> <p>He moved toward her, his hand moving up to cup her ass. "It's not something wrong with you...You're sexy, and you're fun to be around-the-house, and... I don't know, I'm not going to..." he said. He pulled down his zipper. "Oh...no..." he said with a smile as he dropped his pants. "Not anymore!"</p> <p>In the blink of an eye, he was hard again, and in one fluid motion, he dropped himself between her legs. As soon as the head of his cock touched her, there was a shockwave of pleasure that shook her. His touch made her body tremble all over again. As hard yet softly as he put it, this was a touch to send a message through her body.</p> <p>Her lips opened to kiss her newâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
