She was still dressed, though, and the light of a kitchen light highlighted her curves. I was surprised and pleased, as she hadn't moved while she was making dinner, to find my mind and heart aflame with feelings for her.</p> <p>"You aren't getting married?"</p> <p>"I hope not, but will need one soon."</p> <p>I didn't understand any of her plans, though. The thought of having the children in the meantime came to mind. I couldn't say anything else, and, to my surprise, my cock reacted accordingly.</p> <p>"Well, why don't you go clean up, get cleaned up, and we can have lunch? We'll see what happens. It looks after itself pretty quick though."</p> <p>"Yeah, sure, you know where to."</p> <p>I made my way to her room, turned on the light and brushed by the bed to find an almost-naked woman on her knees before me. She had turned to look at the TV, and the picture of myself before her was still on. I was still not sure what to say, until I remembered that she was going home later on that day and I didn't know how to start.</p> <p>"Do you have any idea how horny you are?"</p> <p>"I was just going to tell you I was sorry, but I couldn't. It has been a while since I had sex."</p> <p>"Hmmm."</p> <p>"So, I guess having to admit that to yourself will have to change now," she said, with a wry smile.</p> <p>"It's been a while since I've been with a woman."</p> <p>"Well, what do you think?"</p> <p>I sat down on the bed and crossed my legs, giving her room to kneel before me. She slowly lowered her head until her lips touched mine, and her tongue explored my mouth. I let my eyes drift to hers, noticing their sensual curves in shadows that I was becoming accustomed to. Her hands were still on my stomach, lightly tickling it, as they had before. Suddenly, she pulled away, smiling at me. Her eyes were red, the glow of a fire I'd seen before, from outside the sun.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I think I know a way that would work."</p> <p>"That's a great idea."</p> <p>She seemed surprised by my suggestion, but quickly accepted my offer. She got my trousers undone and removed them and my boxers, and stood up to take my shoes off. I could see her wet pussy through her silky panties, clearly wet between them.</p> <p>"Do you want to taste my juices?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>She reached behind and pulled them off me, revealing my erect cock. She slid her panties off my body, kneeling next to me, and took my cock in her mouth as she'd done earlier in the evening. She started with light kisses on my left side, moving up to kiss my neck. As she did this, she moved a finger to my balls and massaged them. She repeated this for my right side and I felt her tongue and then lips against my cock. Her tongue worked its magic, licking the bottom side of my shaft and moving along my skin. As my cock moved against her face, more of my juices leaked out, onto her. Her tongue moved deeper at the base of my cock, licking off the head and then moving along the ridges. I thought it almost hurt she was sucking me, my cock was so sensitive, but I guess a little pleasure comes into your own experience after all. She moved along my shaft, licking both sides of the head as its head was caught in her teeth. Her teeth raked against the tip several times, and my cock jumped in her mouth. Her mouth never moved, even as one finger moved over the head. It was the most pleasurable thing I'd experienced in a long while, and I knew what I was about to come.</p> <p>I felt my balls tighten, but she was in control of the situation, and my orgasm would last longer due to my sensitivity. She sucked me off as best she could, enjoying my reactions. I'd never come this way before, but it just felt good, very good. She removed her lips and tongue, releasing me from her mouth, and moved around the bed. She kneeled in front of me, placing her hands on either side of me. Her kisses were still slow, but I could still smell my woman on her, a hint of my after-shave. She used her hands to caress my face and neck, and I felt her fingers rubbing the front of my cock. She kissed around myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
