So fucking much of my cock pushed against my hand. I pulled off the cucumber, the head popping out of my hand. "No" I told her, "Fuck me now."</p> <p>Dorothy leaned forward, her hand still at mine, spreading her legs slightly. I guided the head at her opening. It was slippery with juices, and slid in easily. My fingers pressed into her sex. She began to move her hips. I pushed back, sliding out, then in to the entrance. I pressed gently.</p> <p>Her sex slid onto my hand. "Put it in again, give yourself to me." I pushed forward, her sex sliding back on me. "Yes, push into me" she groaned, "please do me."</p> <p>I pushed into her, her hips pressing back at my cock, her hand twisting around mine. I pushed further, then again. I pushed in deeper, deeper. I looked into the mirror as I did all those things. Dorothy's mouth opened even wider, her tongue sliding through her lips. I looked into the mirror as her head moved, her hair hanging like a ball in her face. I grabbed her waist, my free hand pulling her ass to me as I thrust in.</p> <p>Dorothy's eyes were closed, her mouth opening to take me in. Her hips moved back and forth like she wanted me to take her again. I pushed deep, and she moved so I had fuller access. I pulled back again, then again, and again, until her hips were pushing into my hand.</p> <p>"FUCK ME" she moaned. I pushed back into her, her sex driving onto my hand. My hand came away with just enough room for me to pull out. "Fuck my ass," she whispered. I pushed into her, pulling out. "YES!" she yelled, her body moving back to me, her hips pushing back again. I pushed against her. The head of the cucumber pushed hard against her rear passage. I pulled back, my hands holding her ass. Slowly, just enough so her bottom hole pushed against the head, I pushed.</p> <p>Her body began to move in time to my thrusting. It pushed back again, I pulled back, and she moved with me. Her body responded. I pushed forward again. "Yes," I groaned, "fuck me and fuck me, all your way"</p> <p>Tears ran down her cheeks as she pushed down on me, her body moving on my hand. I looked at the reflection as she moved faster and faster in front of me. "More," she whispered, "come inside me." I felt the cucumber start to slide out, sliding down my hand. "I'm going to come again," I said, pushing back into her.</p> <p>Dorothy's body thrashed between my hand and the countertop. She leaned on me. "Yes baby," she groaned, "fuck me faster and harder." It was all getting too much for me. I pulled back again, then again, my hand sliding out. I moved my hand back and forth, pulling them out, then pushing again. This time I pressed into to her. Her body jerked back and forth in time with me. Her cries grew in volume and pitch. Her back arched off the countertop. "Fuck me baby!" she moaned. I pressed into her, moving forward, not pulling back but thrusting forward.</p> <p>"No," I heard her whimper. "Don't stop!" "Again, please!" It was just too much. It wasn't enough. I pulled back and forward, thrusting into her, her body trying to pull me into her, her head lifting off the counter as she screamed and gasped. "Fuck me!" she screamed again. I held myself buried in her as her body stiffened. I pressed into her as deep as I could. She shook against me, as I felt the first waves of the warm fluid of her orgasm pass through her, washing over me as my own hips continued to thrust away.</p> <p>I lay next to her, completely spent, breathing hard, just holding her close. I leaned back and looked at her. She was still wrapped around me and had collapsed on the counter. I slipped out of the bed. I moved to her side, pulling her down to my chest. I kissed her and stroked her cheek from her cheek to her neck. She seemed to smile. It was clear then that she liked that, that it wasn't what she wanted.</p> <p>*</p> <p>When the kids got back, I went into the kitchen and made them some soup. Dorothy was doing a very good job with the dishes. There were just so many things she could do. They ate silently. I helped her clean up the kitchen. I sat out on the porch to watch as her kids played with the toysâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
