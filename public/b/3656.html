I want you to fuck me like you took me down." As I slid out of her, I brought my fingers to her mouth, running them over her face. She began eating my hand with fervor.</p> <p>"Fuck me, please fuck me" she screamed. I moved to mount her, laying on my back behind her. Taking the cock, I slid myself back inside of her. She was so hot that I didn't think I could go on like this. I reached for some lubricant on the nightstand and lubed the dildo in. I pulled my legs back and put my feet flat on the bed, pulling her back into me. Her hips began rocking back and forth under my fucking, and she was moaning like a madwoman.</p> <p>"Ohh, fuck me! Fuck me, fuck me, oh yeah, just like that, I'm going to cum!" she screamed. Her hands gripped the sheets as her hips pumped her pussy against me. She rode through her climax, until it subsided, pushing her face down harder to keep her head up. I felt my dick throb as she came, my dick shooting out its load inside her pussy.</p> <p>She leaned back on the bed, pulling my cum-covered cock up into her and grabbing it, pulling every bit of friction out as she jerked my cock to an even higher state of stiffness. I pushed her legs back further toward her chest, exposing her tight, wet pussy to me. I put my arms under her legs, and she wrapped hers around me. Leaning forward, I took her nipple into my mouth and sucked on it lightly.</p> <p>"Ohhhhhh, yes. Just like that!" She cried out as I moved my hips over hers and pushed them up toward her. She lifted her hips to meet me before I drove them down again.</p> <p>"Come on! Let's do it that way. Stick it in my hot wet pussy. Ride me, oh, come on, fill me up!!" she cried, bucking her pussy on me. I was thrusting with her, so hard we were both crying out at the top of our lungs, as each of our climaxes was building more and more.</p> <p>When we were finally finished, kissing each other while still standing on our backs, we sat up again. I looked over at the clock on the nightstand. I realized that it was 6:15 PM, still half an hour before lunch. I stood and walked to my bag, grabbed it and started looking for my keys.</p> <p>"No don't!" she yelled at me as she slapped me across the face. "No getting dressed. I already had to shower before school...I can wait!"</p> <p>"Okay, okay, I'll just get the keys," I stammered.</p> <p>"But honey, I have to go to the mall, and you have to pick me up in the morning. My mom will be gone for a couple hours."</p> <p>"You're kidding, right?" She said as she slapped me again, and began walking to the door. "Honey, my mom will be gone in a little bit!"</p> <p>"Okay," I said as I walked back to my bag. "See you in the morning...and you better not forget to lock the door." I quickly closed the door, grabbed my keys from the hook behind me and walked out. My dick was throbbing, and the room filled with the scent of sex as I walked around to pick up the keys.</p> <p>"MOM!" I yelled to her as she came in the door a few minutes later. My mom has been coming in every Saturday and I still hadn't picked her up for lunch. I heard her yell again before I saw her.</p> <p>"Mom, are you okay?" I called while walking past her on my way to school.</p> <p>"I just woke up. You two were in the middle of something," she said. "You had your fun, didn't you?" We both laughed. I just laughed and shut down my laptop, not noticing her at first. She seemed so sweet and I just didn't realize until now how much she had changed. I was thinking that whatever happened between me, my mother and my sister may not be much, but, that's another storyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
