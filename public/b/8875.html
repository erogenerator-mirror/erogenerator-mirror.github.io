Ohh!" she moaned, throwing her head back as she came. Her hands, which had been caressing her breasts, were now tugging on her nipples.</p> <p>"My god!" Karen cried, her voice full of emotion. "You're making me cum again!"</p> <p>Her pussy spasmed around him. "Sooo good," she grunted. "So good! Sooo fucking good!"</p> <p>Her legs fell to the bed, as she pressed them against his chest. He held her close to him. Her breathing stopped for a second, and then resumed.</p> <p>"That was amazing, honey," he said.</p> <p>She sighed. "Yes ..."</p> <p>"I always love you, Karen," he said, holding her tightly now, their naked bodies pressed together. "Always," he added.</p> <p>"I love you," she said, with a whisper. "And I never wanted you, but I love being with you."</p> <p>"I know," said Paul.</p> <p>Karen wrapped her arms around him. "You're so good to me," she said. "You're never going to leave me. Never! Never!"</p> <p>He pressed her back gently, then lifted her face to kiss her. Karen's lips parted. Paul was on her in a heartbeat, his mouth hot and wet against hers. Their tongues swirled against each other, and Karen moaned when her husband's cock slipped inside of her. She wrapped a leg around him and locked his waist, and they began to move together.</p> <p>"I love you, Karen," Paul said, his voice a husky whisper. He kissed her and stroked her breasts, his hands kneading them gently.</p> <p>"I know you do, Paul," Karen told him softly. "I love you. Always, always!" she added, pulling him tighter to her. "And never will I leave you! Never, never! Never! I love you! I love you!"</p> <p>"I love you, too, Karen," Paul agreed. "And I'll always be with you!"</p> <p>Karen smiled, and kissed him again. She was breathless, but she continued to rock to the music. She had always been a happy girl, and she seemed to be aching to be with her man again. Her legs tightened around him, and she moved her hips down, grinding her cunt against his. She was lost in the music, and she didn't even realize that her husband was doing the same the next moment. Their mouths were sealed.</p> <p>"Oh, God," she sighed as her hand pulled the zipper of his suit down. "Don't let it go! Oh, god!" She broke their kiss long enough to look around them first. "This has to be the most beautiful thing I've ever seen!" She pulled his suit off and cast it aside.</p> <p>"Shit ...," she groaned as he began to stroke first one nipple and then the other. "That's it! Mmm!" Paul's hands moved to her ass, pulling her pussy against him.</p> <p>They locked eyes. Their lips were parted slightly. They both knew that they were breathing heavily, and Karen knew, with her eyes and her hand, that she was going to be as wet and sticky, as she could be.</p> <p>"Do you love me?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes!" Paul agreed. He felt his cock swell again. Karen was so fucking wet, and she wrapped her legs tightly around his waist.</p> <p>"Oh, god, yes!" she moaned when her husband stroked his cock into her. Then she leaned forward, kissing him hotly. "I love you, too!" she moaned as she rocked her hips faster. "Oh, god! Oh, god, you're fucking me!" She began to push his cock in and out, faster and faster, and she could barely breathe. She was panting, and her mouth hung open so she could talk. "Yes!" she cried. "Yes! Oh, god!" She couldn't take anymore. "Fuck me, Paul! Oh, god, Oh, god! Oh, god!" Her fingers were on Paul's hips, and she had moved to press herself against him.</p> <p>"I love you, Karen," Paul told her when she came. "I love you! I love you!"</p> <p>"Do you love me?" she asked. "Do you love me? Do you love me?"</p> <p>"I love you, baby!" Paul told her. "I'll never let you go, honey! I'll always love you!"</p> <p>"That's right! Oh, gee, no, that's not true! I love you! Oh, fuck! I love you! God, Paul! Oh, god! Oh, god!
