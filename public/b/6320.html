I pulled out until just the head was inside her and then back in, working my cock with the tight muscles of her pussy. Both of us could not get close enough to each other, the room filled with the scent of our lust and the sounds of the music. My hand left her ass and I began to stroke her clit between my fingers. I could feel my own excitement rising.</p> <p>I could feel the tension in my balls tighten as I watched her pussy slide down my cock with each stroke. With my cock in her, I wanted nothing more than to thrust once more into her pussy. As I looked down, the way mine felt inside her, I saw my own balls throb and my balls ache. With one hand she reached underneath herself to hold my balls and her fingers reached down to her asshole, pulling herself open for me. As I continued to tease her clit, I felt two fingers push inside her ass.</p> <p>It took all the control I had not to cum at this point. I could not hold out any longer. As I watched, I came like I had never cum before. Wave after wave, each one weaker than the last. As I came, she pushed her ass against me one last time, crying out and cumming a third time.</p> <p>When I pulled out and laid over her, my cock still hard and dripping, "Oh, it feels like I've been doing that long enough." She just rolled back and forth and moaned like a little girl. It felt so amazing. I rolled off her and lay on my side, trying to catch my breath. She lay there next to me, "Let's just get him out of here. That was fantastic!" I lay beside her, enjoying her beauty. We kissed, her breath coming in quick shallow breaths.</p> <p>"You're not mad about me or what you did to him?"</p> <p>"No, not really, I just wanted to be sure." Her voice sounded relaxed, but I could tell it was laced with a little fear. I didn't understand it and didn't ask her why. When it was out of my head, I knew what she meant. Maybe it made me realize just how much I loved her. She was very special to me and all I could ever want was her. It was never any matter but her love that mattered or how special we shared the experienceâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
