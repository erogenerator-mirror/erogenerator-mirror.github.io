Her legs flew open and closed as her head thrashed, she was unable to take the sensations, her mind was blank. Wave after wave of bliss rolled over her as the waves of pleasure kept rolling in.</p> <p>He lay beside her kissing her neck, she tasted of salty shampoo and a little of her own musk. He rolled the duvet over them both and gently rolled to face her. Her eyes opened to meet his as he slowly moved himself over her body. Her legs hung down along side his sides as he moved himself over her, their bodies moved with a sensuous motion.</p> <p>They were on the bed gently kissing as they savoured the feeling of each with his fingers caressing her body. She closed her eyes letting him have his way, it was like they were lovers at last. They rolled over with slow sensuous movements, he held his weight above her and she felt her heart pound. She felt totally fulfilled, she was no longer concerned about whether he knew she was in fact having intercourse with other men.</p> <p>She felt his body touch hers as he lifted himself over her. He rolled himself to lie on his side, he bent over her and kissed her forehead.</p> <p>"I have a confession to make," he said.</p> <p>"No?"</p> <p>"No. If I ever find out anything that will make you jealous I'll come into contact with some guy and you'd know it." He paused. "Are you coming with me? Is this what you want? I'll be there, I'll be there when you feel the need for sex."</p> <p>She laughed. "If you're going to keep on as I'm doing, then fuck me then. I have my own little secret to keep."</p> <p>"And will your pussy still be available after you've had me?"</p> <p>"Yes," she laughed. "Just don't get it on the first date. I want you!" she laughed.</p> <p>He laughed also. We had sex on our wedding night, even though we hadn't been married since he had a vasectomy. He didn't have to worry about the size of the boy's penis, she didn't even let him fuck her after the deed was done. It wasn't a big deal after all, not the first and certainly not the last.</p> <p>"Don't feel you can fuck me now. I have lots better places that will give pleasure to my body," he pouted. "Are you ready to take me now?"</p> <p>"Please." She pouted, she was really eager, but there was no going back, she didn't want to come to him again.</p> <p>She felt him move away from her. "Let me turn us over," she said. He rolled over on his back, and she got on top. He lifted her onto herself, he lay in the middle. She reached out for him, and he moved himself to cover her.</p> <p>"No," she said, trying to get herself on his back, "please." She had no illusions with what she wanted.</p> <p>She laid herself on top of him, feeling the firmness and feeling the excitement as his soft penis started to grow inside her. She began to push herself up, he lay on his back. She moved herself to lie on him, moving his penis around between her legs. His penis was longer than she had imagined it, but he was as hard as stone.</p> <p>She lay on him, she could feel him hard against her. She was still holding herself up on him. She couldn't do that, she loved feeling him on her. She looked at his face. It was a big surprise to see it was really him. She wondered if he knew. He didn't say a word, he simply looked at her and his face was all expression.</p> <p>She began to push herself down on him and to press him to her, she was moving up and down, slowly at first, then moving faster until she felt his first jet of sperm against her cervix. They both screamed. He spurted and she felt him move. The sperm had begun to have an effect on her, and she felt another orgasm building. He was smiling as her vagina clamped around him.</p> <p>Her body was twitching and twitching as her heart beat away inside her head. She felt the orgasm begin to fade. Her emotions were gone. He had finished up inside her. She felt him withdraw so that her vagina left him. She smiled at her achievement.</p> <p>She pushed herself up. She felt proud. She had made her man feel better than ever, and she felt so happy that he had completed her sexual conquest. She felt a tear roll down her cheek. "I'm happier now than I can think," she said with a tear in her eye.</p> <p>He hugged her and gave her a hug tooâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
