"There is no need, you don't need to worry about it. We won't tell anyone that you and I weren't friends."</p> <p>The rest of the week was uneventful. My parents and my brother spent time with us while I spent time in my room and they were going to take advantage of me for the day. Monday morning brought a loud yawn and I awoke feeling refreshed. I wandered downstairs to find my parents making breakfast and I was not disappointed when my sister, wearing my brother's shirt, opened the door to my room, a questioning look on her face.</p> <p>She asked, "Can I sleep with you this way?" I smiled and nodded before pulling on my sheets and following her inside.</p> <p>On Saturday morning we were back in bed when my parents took the family room and closed the door. I turned over and began my explanation.</p> <p>My parents said, "You can keep us busy until you are ready and I can get your breakfast ready."</p> <p>I laughed and said, "I know exactly what that is. I'm not going to argue with you, even if you tell me to go eat."</p> <p>They laughed and said, "Yeah, we'll probably tell all the family when it is time to eat."</p> <p>We had breakfast naked and I left out to use the bathroom. When I returned, my mom was still on the couch where I left her before she got up. I was a bit surprised as she didn't seem upset with how I treated her. Mom came over to me and gave me a big hug, saying good morning and promising to see me in the morning.</p> <p>I thanked her, kissed her cheek and left the room. My brothers came down, asking if they could play football until they were up. They all agreed.</p> <p>I told them I didn't want to see them any longer but I'd still sleep with them and have a shower and a change of clothes with me when they were done.</p> <p>It was around half eleven when my parents gave me the keys by my bed. I got up and walked towards the bedroom. I found my brother laying face down on my bed with a pillow under his head. I went over and gently kissed him.</p> <p>He smiled back and stretched. "That was a good night." He rolled back over to face me. "Thanks, but thanks for being a good person."</p> <p>"Gee, you're just like me." I said, sliding my hand over his chest before lying down on his bed. "We need to pick up your parents when we get home."</p> <p>"No, no, we have enough time if I need to do that." He rolled over to face me, holding my hands in front of me. "What's the big deal? You said you wanted me to take you to bed." I nodded. "Is it safe to get up?"</p> <p>"You need to go take care of things for one more day." He got up and walked to his room and closed the door. Mom and Dad were busy talking, the whole time I was looking at my brother. Mom glanced at me, who was still staring at my brother, then looked back at Daddy and sat down. She smiled.</p> <p>"I know you have to go," she said. "I'm sorry," it didn't really sound like she was speaking of him. "You can stay if you want, but I'll never leave you. I don't take it personally."</p> <p>I looked at her with her eyes still wide. "I hope you realize that you are a good brother," she said. "Now go play."</p> <p>Before I could respond, a phone beeped from the nightstand next to the bed. I picked up the phone. It was my dad. "Who's calling? Oh shit," he said with a nervous voice that made his body quiver and his voice shake.</p> <p>"Who?" I asked.</p> <p>He was looking at me like he was trying to figure out the words. "Why did you answer my phone this morning? I had to go to the bathroom to answer it," he said, leaning forward.</p> <p>"Did you not want to talk to me now?" His voice had the edge of panic in it. "I was upset and I didn't want to talk again and now my brother is here."</p> <p>He was visibly shaking and almost started to cry. He turned my face to face him. "Why didn't you talk to me last night when we came home?" He said. "I need to find out who I want to talk to and what the hell it is that you have to do now? I don't want to bother your brother any more than you need to know about me."</p> <p>"He's out of the houseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
