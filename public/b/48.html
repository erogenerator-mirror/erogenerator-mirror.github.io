As I continued up her legs and finally to her stomach, my fingers moved to the tiny bit of material covering her breasts. They were so small and yet so hard. I kneaded them gently between my fingers and thumbs. She let out a soft, throaty moan. I continued up until I reached the top of her breasts. I squeezed them tightly, my palms kneading them as they heaved up and down. She arched her back, lifting her tits with her hands.</p> <p>I ran my thumbs down to her waist and slowly made my way down her stomach. When I reached the top of her panties, I gently tugged downward. She opened up her mouth to catch any sounds as my hands slid down and under her panties. I felt her shudder when the thin strip of fabric disappeared through her labia and I could tell how wet she was by the sound of her voice. When I pulled her panties off, she opened her legs wider, allowing me better access to her. The juices now glistening from her swollen pussy lips. My fingers had only begun to trail along the crack of her ass.</p> <p>I leaned in as, taking another step back, she spread her legs ever wider so I could access the depths of her sex. In response, I could only wait.</p> <p>As I leaned in, she closed her eyes and parted her pussy lips with her fingers. The wetness made as wet as it was. Her clit stood proud and up, begging for attention. I was not sure if she was anticipating my touch but it was not a moment to be embarrassed. Instead, I leaned forward to capture her clit between my lips. The moment I did, her cunt opened and she began to ride my face.</p> <p>She kept moving her body to meet my tongue as it slid across her clit. Her eyes were still closed as she ground her pussy against my mouth. Soon she was humping me to the point of almost knocking over our bed.</p> <p>"Yes, yes, yes!" she moaned into the pillow. "Oh, yes, yes! That's what you do to me! Oh!" At the exact moment she was cumming, I could feel her cunt start to spasm, and it wasn't just from orgasm, it was from the intensity of her orgasm. I felt her pussy gushing all over my face and was surprised how she had not cum on my face before.</p> <p>She collapsed in on her side as she lay there. I held her, one hand stroking her back and the other running across her cunt. As she came to, she looked in my eyes, smiling. I took that as a good sign and climbed onto the bed, rolling over so she could look me in the eye.</p> <p>"Goodnight, Tom," she said softly as she drifted off after cumming.</p> <p>"Goodnight, Mom," I replied as I leaned over and kissed her lips. "I'll see you tomorrowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
