I'm looking forward to getting rid of her when I get home.'</p> <p>'I know what he means though. I really am looking forward to a long stay in the country.'</p> <p>This time we spent the rest of the day together and we talked about how nice our apartment sounded and about our relationship and the lack of sex. We decided to go to the museum again and we spent that last day together enjoying every second of each other's company and we decided to do something other than shopping.</p> <p>'Come home for dinner tonight, you won't get a chance until tomorrow.'</p> <p>'What should I wear?'</p> <p>'What do you think?'</p> <p>'Just go with the flow and wear my favourite outfit, a dark green dress with black leather and a matching skirt that comes down to my knees.'</p> <p>His heart rate was increasing, and he felt that he could pass time with his thoughts while he made love to me. He couldn't wait to tell my husband about what he saw so far.</p> <p>'What outfit?"</p> <p>'A dress that I know and love very, very much and I don't mind being recognised.'</p> <p>'Well you said 'dressing' and 'dressing' together.'</p> <p>"I know what you meant, and I'm just trying to make a point.'</p> <p>"I know, just go with the flow, it's really hard not to.'</p> <p>'I'm sorry, it's just that I was wondering if you'd mind if I wore some of it?"</p> <p>'You can dress, I don't think it would bother me if you did. My reaction to clothes being pretty much how they are is that I'd get a kick out of the thought of being dressed by you while we're at a club. I'm not sure that I'd want to go on a date with you wearing something like this.'</p> <p>'That's what I'm thinking. I would get quite excited if I wore something like this which is what I saw you doing last night.'</p> <p>'Wow, that was a bit hot.'</p> <p>"Yes, but it was also very exciting and erotic, and I think it would really come easily to you.'</p> <p>'I can honestly say that I can't say that with the way that we're going to be together, but if you can agree to wear the dress I've in my house that it's all that I can ask for.'</p> <p>'Are you sure this is okay with you?'</p> <p>'Of course I agree, but I also agree if you decide to wear it.'</p> <p>'I agree, but I also agree that wearing something like it will come naturally to you.'</p> <p>'Well, do you?'</p> <p>'I don't know.'</p> <p>'I think it'll look great, it certainly will.'</p> <p>He told me that the idea of wearing something as dark as that outfit didn't bother him and he thought that I was very pretty that night with that dress in front of him.</p> <p>'What's the matter, are you worried that I'm not to think too much about the dress while I'm inside that apartment to be a woman?'</p> <p>I'm not sure whether I was being a woman or not but that evening it felt so very right for me to be dressed so sexually to the outside world but to wear something like that when we were at a club. I also felt so very naughty and so sexually excited that I felt like my sex was making a presence in my house. The last thing I wanted to do was to appear too eager as the dress that I was wearing was something more suitable.</p> <p>'I feel so sexy and wicked like this, like I'm a real woman wearing something so sexy.'</p> <p>'Well, you can't look as sexy as you feel,' I told him. 'Just look as real as you feel, like this is the real thing.'</p> <p>As the night ended we went to our respective houses where we had the whole house to ourselves and went to go on our own dates. When I suggested that we go out for dinner again that evening I got a devilish smile on my face at the thought of making up in the apartment with her. I felt so excited and so naughty at the prospect of being dressed in that outfit that I couldn't help but imagine what it would be like to feel her and she feeling as sexy as my house was feeling. Of course I would be doing some things that I knew that she would enjoy too.</p> <p>I was still feeling guilty about how I dressed after that evening with his wife. I thought if I was as excited as I was feeling by the idea of being dressed the way you dressed it would be more exciting too.
