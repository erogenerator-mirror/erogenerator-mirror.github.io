Her nipples were erect, and looked good with a little extra pressure on them, looking good.</p> <p>“Okay, you can leave now,” she told me and I left. As I left I noticed the robe was gaping a bit, so I quickly opened it to try to figure out whether it was one of those things that would make some people get mad. So I closed the robe and got dressed. This part of the vacation had started a while back so I decided to just take one more dip in the pool as I left town.</p> <p>“I wonder how much more there is to this pool than a hot shower?” I thought. The water felt warm, and the chlorine in the water felt kind of good. I swam about a couple of laps and had a beer. As I went back to the house I could see the back where we had moved our suitcases. In the front hallway, where I was sitting, that the door was open, I noticed that there was one light on. I assumed she was in the shower. The shower was not as big as mine, so there was plenty enough room to stand and urinate and clean up after.</p> <p>There was one big difference though. The one light on in the bathroom allowed me to see much better, though the shower was really big and full of water. I found a towel to sit on so that I could dry off and I had a big fluffy towel to wrap around my waist. I also took the opportunity to put some soap on my cock, as it jumped slightly when I washed it. Maybe my wife hadn’t noticed. In the bathroom I felt so comfortable. I looked around and saw that our pool was only about ten feet from the door. I felt like I should do something; I mean that I was probably the first guy at our new club who had ever tried it; but it felt good to do that and I felt free. I stood up, took another step, and I felt myself grow to full strength. My head was buzzing with the alcohol when I walked over there. I opened the door. There was a girl in the shower with her back to me, her hair dripping water all over the place, which only turned me on more. She turned her body around as the water poured down on her naked flesh. It felt so good to see her.</p> <p>“Hey, you coming in?” she asked, giving me the biggest smile I’d ever seen, and I told her I was. She came in and closed the door. “This is Bob,” she introduced herself, “and you must be Mike,” she said, pointing to me. She was really sexy, and I was actually attracted to her. I stood up and kissed her on the cheek and we started walking back toward the house.</p> <p>We made the walk about two blocks towards our house. She kissed me on the lips, and I could taste myself on her for a second, and then she pulled back and said, “You’re really sexy,” and kissed me again. I was getting hard again. I was beginning to think that maybe there was no way that there could be anything between us.</p> <p>She grabbed a towel out of the cabinet and wrapped it around her, then started drying her hair. She looked incredible in the outfit, which meant that she had no need for a bra. She turned and looked over at me and her hair looked pretty good to me. She smiled and smiled some more. I could feel my cock rising. She turned around and walked back the way we came. I was looking up her leg. I looked up her body when I got a good look at her ass. It wasn’t the best or the best butt I’d ever seen; it was the best ass I’d ever seen, as well as the biggest I’d ever seen; but I liked what I was seeing. Her ass was full and round with a good amount of padding, and it was so good in the water, I found myself thinking of it at every opportunity that I had. I felt my cock pulse. That was one of that things they did in the bathroom sometimes.</p> <p>Before we got back to the house we took some drinks and went downstairs on the patio. There was also an umbrella. We sat down at the table and had some more drinks. I was thinking about her and my trip and she was thinking about mine and how much of a turn on it had been. While I was thinking about her, she’d just—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
