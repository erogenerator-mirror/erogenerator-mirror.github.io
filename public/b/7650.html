If only...</p> <p>She looked up, and his eyes nearly popped out of their sockets, as she reached down and took his hand in hers. With the lightest, sweetest, most intimate motion, she closed his little fingers around her palm, one at a time, and they slid slowly and easily inside. He closed his eyes, and breathed in slowly as the feelings of intimacy washed over his entire body. There was no turning back.</p> <p>He put his mouth on hers as he pulled her body closer to him. His hands slid from her wrists, down her arms, finally cupping her breasts at the same time.</p> <p>Their lips parted suddenly. His hands fell from her breasts, and she immediately leaned up and brushed them over his cheeks. He shivered and opened his eyes, gazing at her. She tilted up and kissed him full on the lips again.</p> <p>She pulled back suddenly and looked down to his expression of surprise. "I didn't know you were..." Her voice quivered and she swallowed rapidly. "I don't even really think..."</p> <p>"I thought you did," he said with the hint of a grin and a blush on his face.</p> <p>"I know; but..." She smiled and kissed him again.</p> <p>With a laugh she sat up, facing him. She pushed him on the bed, and then leaned back in, resting her head on his shoulder, one hand lightly touching his cheek.</p> <p>A wave of heat surged through her as his hand moved across her stomach. She looked over at him, and he was staring at her, his expression half-lidded, half-innocent, and she felt a shudder run through her body.</p> <p>"You feel incredible..." Her eyes widened at his confession, and she gave a little curtsey.</p> <p>He grinned back and looked up at her again.</p> <p>"Good to hear, Ms. Parker," he said. "I'm all for taking my lover's virginity, too."</p> <p>"But you'll want a lot more for me, won't you," she asked.</p> <p>He tilted her chin up, and smiled. "I think you already have. Not that I'm complaining," he said, and ran a single finger down her neck and across the back of her ear. It sent a shiver down her spine and jolted her body with jolt of pleasure.</p> <p>"You're the most incredible man who ever made me feel like a woman."</p> <p>His thumb ran lightly along her cheek, then across her lips again. "You mean like a man. Just like a woman, Ms. Parker," he said. "Oh my gosh, you're so... pretty."</p> <p>She reached down to trace a finger under his cheek. He smiled again, and then moved his face forward to brush her lips lightly.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>She felt his chest and face against hers as he lay beside her.</p> <p>He kissed the top of her head and she leaned back and grinned. "That was good," she sighed.</p> <p>He leaned down and nibbled on her ear. She let out a little moan as he kissed her neck under her hairline.</p> <p>"I'd have never thought you'd feel so confident and confident, Ms. Parker." He nuzzled her ear, then kissed it again, then let his lips travel slowly down her neck once more.</p> <p>She sighed and sighed again, and he was smiling, too. "I've got a lot of confidence in you," she said in a sultry voice.</p> <p>She felt his hands run across her belly, up her thighs and up the insides of her thighs to touch the sensitive skin at the edge of her thighs. His skin slid slowly across hers in slow, languid circles, and she closed her eyes and ran her fingers through his thick, dark, manly hair. She sighed and he moved back down to kiss her neck and shoulder.</p> <p>She let out a little squeal as his lips kissed their way slowly to her collarbone, and up to cup a taut nipple in his mouth. He sucked softly at first one side and then the other, making her shudder and shudder as the pleasure filled her. He began to move his hand, moving it up and down the outside of her thigh on her warm flesh, up to her abdomen, then moving up toward her belly button to stroke at the top of her breasts, feeling her shiver and goose her skin as his fingers stroked her. He let the hand caress her skin as he ran it up and down her body, and she sighed and put her hands up to run along the sides of his head as he teased at the soft curls atopâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
