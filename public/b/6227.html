You still want me to touch you?"</p> <p>"Yeah." She nodded.</p> <p>"Okay, you asked for it. Now, let's see if you can get me to be really gentle and make you feel good. This time I don't need that crap. Now give me that fucking phone!" He slammed his hand down on his desk to stop her as he got up and reached into his desk drawer and pulled out a small piece of paper. He threw it right at her. It slammed loudly into her hand and she felt a sharp pain shoot through her legs. She looked down and saw blood on her fingertips, but it didn't stop. She put her hand up to her mouth and began to suck that bloody finger. Then she felt a pain, and her eyes flew open in shock at what was happening.</p> <p>"Oh my god! I'm bleeding!" She screamed.</p> <p>"Yeah, sorry. You did that by accident. Did you know? It wouldn't have happened if you didn't run down and get us the fuck over." Eric laughed as he pushed Amy aside, and pulled up his cock. She sat still as a rabbit in a headlights factory as he slid over her, her legs going taut like he was taking her. He was careful, and she felt her pussy tighten around the intruder. He pulled her even tighter, and she could feel every bit of his cock rubbing against her lips. He leaned down and began to kiss her neck, and she began to grind her hips into him, wanting it all the way in. He felt her hips begin to move against him and he realized she had stopped talking.</p> <p>"Oh my God! Oh no." She looked back at Eric, her eyes questioning. He held her firmly with one hand and reached over to her stomach with his other hand. He could feel the swelling of his stomach through the thin fabric of her dress, and realized once again that the fabric was probably getting in the way of his cock now. He looked at her once again and saw all was lost, there was nothing left now, and her legs would be his forever. He reached inside her dress to find her bra, but found she was wearing a thong, and he knew it was soaking wet. He looked up at her face and saw a look of panic, a look that he wanted to see forever, and it wasn't fear. Instead, a look of pure lust and ecstasy.</p> <p>"What am I going to do? I've never let anyone else touch me like this before!" He didn't care what she thought was or wasn't about it at that point, he saw in her eyes just what was wrong with her, there was no love or happiness to the look on her face, only total, unbridled hunger.</p> <p>"Come here, baby. Don't say it." He walked over to her and stood right next to her. She looked at his crotch, and saw that his cock, and whatever part of it it was that was sticking out from under his pants, was hard as iron.</p> <p>"You should touch me, Eric." She said softly as she tried to sit up.</p> <p>"Fuck, what's gotten into you?" He ran his hand under her chin, lifting her head up and kissing her mouth. She tried to pull away, but he held her down and pulled her neck back to his. He slipped his tongue into her mouth, and began to roll it around her own. Her hands were still at her sides for a moment and then they began to slide in circles all over his chest. When he pulled away he looked down and saw the same look she had just gotten and the blood on her hands, and he had a hard time not having the urge to rip her clothes off. He ran his hands down her arms, down the side of her body, and then up her sides to finally feel her ribs. She squirmed her body in response and he grabbed her and pulled her right arm up and behind her back as he continued rubbing her arms with his hands, feeling the muscles and her skin, feeling her tension, and knowing that he would never let her go.</p> <p>"I never wanted anyone like this, but I can't."</p> <p>"What was that? Are you crazy?" She asked, looking down at his arms.</p> <p>"Nope. I just want you so badly." He reached over and pushed her legs apart with one hand, bending down just enough to slide his cock into her. She had to let go of both her arms to keep from falling in front of him. She felt her own excitement building. Eric pulled her legs up and pushed the tip of his cock in slowly. He could feel the wetness of her already. The whole time he just looked at her, watching her body being violated by this huge thing. Amy could feel herself gettingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
