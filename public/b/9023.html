He began to pull her down the front of his shorts revealing their mutual nudity as they approached.</p> <p>"I'm ready...if you are. You know there's nothing more...to make this better." He gently kissed her nipples eliciting shivering moans of delight, as his fingers traced down her rib cage where her body still ached.</p> <p>"Now I'm ready..." As he bent over to plant a kiss on her stomach that drove her wild with passion.</p> <p>As he pushed her down on the floor, she began to kneel between his legs and she eagerly lowered herself down between his legs. "Mmmmm...that's my pussy...mmm..." Once her pussy was at his mouth, she immediately began taking a hot, wet tongue out into his waiting mouth.</p> <p>"MMMM...so good...so delicious..." She licked his chin, then kissed downward until her mouth was inches from his cock. Instantly, she engulfed his cock with one hot, wet motion and it felt absolutely wonderful. "Ahhhhh...that's it...mmmmh...don't stop...suck me...suck me hard..."</p> <p>As he pulled her head back down, she wrapped her lips around his cock and began to slowly, methodically, bob her head up and down.</p> <p>"I've missed you this month...I'm here for you..." she said with a smile as she kissed his shaft, then licked her hand, which was still slowly stroking him, up and down.</p> <p>Once she wrapped her hand around his cock, she began to stroke him in rhythm to her hand. "Oh...god...that feels so good...please...let me suck you..." She began to pull him, then, just as his hands were on her head, she pulled him out of her mouth with a loud slurp.</p> <p>"Now you're going to fuck me...I don't know when your coming back to me..."</p> <p>He grabbed her hand and led her back across the room to the side of the bed and placed her on the blanket beside him. "Lay down...and make yourself comfortable."</p> <p>As she did as she was told, he quickly moved over her, straddled her hip, and began to kiss her lips again. "I want you to just lay there...and relax...this is perfect..."</p> <p>He took one of her legs and placed it on his shoulder and moved around to the middle of the bed, still kissing her lips and her neck. "I'm a long way from you," he said as he began untying her halter-top.</p> <p>"Mmmm...I'm so glad to be wearing this," she said as she lifted her arms as he released her breast's from their restraints.</p> <p>As she lay there taking his tongue in her mouth and feeling him slowly running his fingers thru her pussy, she wondered if there was something more...her body's needs...just waiting to be unleashed. "Mmmmm...I think I'm gonna be okay...and I'm just ready to be yours..."</p> <p>As he removed his lips from hers, he slid them down her neck and back to her left breast, with the same intensity as he had in her mouth. "Are you ready to be completely mine?" he murmured.</p> <p>"Oh yes..... I want to be yours...but not just yet." She slid down the bed slowly and lay facing him.</p> <p>As he laid on his side beside her, they began to kiss again, while he reached one hand down to her pussy and began to rub it in an ever so familiar rhythm. "MMMM...please.....I want you now...I need to be yours..."</p> <p>"All set then." As they had earlier in the evening, he slid down on top of her, now fully on top of her.</p> <p>As he began to kiss her lips again, his hand began to rub her nipple as hers began to rub hers. "Mmmm...you taste so nice..." he whispered as he began to slowly lick her nipples while he continued to slowly kiss her lips and neck.</p> <p>"Mmmmm...this must feel so good to us..." She began to moan in his mouth as he continued to move to the tip of her other nipple, his lips beginning to nibble again. "MMMM...yes...please fuck me now."</p> <p>He slowly pulled himself out of her and laid down on his back. As he did so, she grabbed his cock and positioned the head between her legs, teasingly sliding herself down on it. "I think it's time to begin..." she smiled as she rose up and moved down along his body, stopping only to kiss her way down his stomach. "Ooooh.....I knew this morning when I first saw your beautifulâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
