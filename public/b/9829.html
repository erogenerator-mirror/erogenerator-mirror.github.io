I don't think I was expecting that I had caught her, at least not her face for that matter. She had dressed, which left just enough material covering her breasts, though, it didn't appear that she was wearing a bra. A black thong showed just enough to leave nothing to the imagination beneath, and her breasts were almost naked. They were perfectly encasing her form, and her nipples showed almost perfectly between them, too. In short, she'd got dressed, too.</p> <p>'I'm sorry,' I said. 'I thought you had a boyfriend.'</p> <p>'So did I. I was going to take a shower, then, but I have one myself,' she said. 'Come on.'</p> <p>She turned around and went off through the other door. As I came into the room, I saw that the curtains had been drawn closed. It made me want to look away from the mirror; a door to the opposite side was open, and my eyes were drawn to her naked form. It looked as though she was going to start the bath for that very purpose, however.</p> <p>'I'm not...' I started to say.</p> <p>'Yes you're not,' she said. 'I want to join you. But first, get to know each other a bit. I want to know if you're good in bed. I've been on a couple of affairs at home, so my experiences have been quite short. That is, if you want me. After all, we've been friends, right?'</p> <p>She pulled me towards the bath. I knew that when I got close to her I would kiss her, because her tongue was in my mouth earlier. My hand slipped back round her side, feeling the swell of her breast. She lifted her leg slightly, bringing her knee up, and I slipped my hand under the material, onto the smooth flesh of her thigh, which was bare to touch. I felt her soft skin, and caressed her, moving my body up her.</p> <p>'That's very nice,' she said.</p> <p>'So very nice,' I replied. I put my hand inside her panties, and felt the warmth of her. It was surprisingly damp, so I moved my fingers closer and ran them smoothly over her mound. She started to move herself against me, so I removed her panties and threw them away.</p> <p>'That doesn't seem so bad, is it,' she said, looking me in the eyes. 'In fact, it looks very nice.'</p> <p>I nodded, looking up.</p> <p>'You're just going to have to make it up to me.'</p> <p>I lifted myself up the sheet on which she was sitting, leaving some space between us. She didn't seem to notice however, and turned her upper body towards me. I slid my hand down over her cheek, towards her lips. Once it was there, I slid my finger across her lips, making her suck it. I moved my finger against hers, and she sucked against it too. I moved my hand down, to her pussy.</p> <p>'It's so pretty,' she said, taking hold of my hand. 'It's like, you're a woman, you can make it as much of yourself as you like.'</p> <p>I didn't say anything. I moved my finger inside to her clitoris, feeling it rise up under its hood. Her leg was spread wide, so it was easy to find the opening to her vagina, where my finger continued to stroke.</p> <p>'That's very nice, Tom.' But then she turned her head to the side. She looked as though she were having second thoughts. 'There's nothing wrong with a woman having sex with you, is there,' she said. 'It's part of a woman experiencing pleasure. It's just part of sex. Isn't it?'</p> <p>She sat back. I was starting to wonder whether maybe I had overreacted, but I knew that, despite what might have happened before today, I didn't want to take things further. Not for the first or even second time today.</p> <p>'What do you mean?' she asked. I just stared into the bathroom mirror at her.</p> <p>'It feels so different to just holding the penis, just inside you, that is.'</p> <p>'But is that what it's like to be inside a man?' she said, laughing a little.</p> <p>'Yes, it is. You're so full inside, and your body is so tight. But it feels good, too, although I've not quite thought of that. Does it feel good, to have a man inside you...?'</p> <p>'Yes, I suppose I must feel good with a man inside me.'</p> <p>'There is something I can do with that, as long as it isn't too rough,' I said. I wanted to say 'I want to see your breastsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
