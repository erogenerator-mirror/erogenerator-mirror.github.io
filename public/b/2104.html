I said, and I turned to leave the bathroom. "Wait, please don't go!" I heard a voice call. I turned and saw it was Jessica.</p> <p>"I'm gonna go get a shower," she said as she walked past me. I closed the door to the shower room, turned the water on and washed the blood off my body. I dried it off and went out into the shower. I put on the sweats and the shirt and tried to dress. I finally finished and stood in front of the mirror.</p> <p>"No way!" I said loudly to myself, "I have to change!"</p> <p>I stepped out of the bathroom wrapped only in a towel. I got into my bag and changed.</p> <p>"What's that mean?" I whispered to no one. I took my gym bag, got in my car and drove toward the gym. I had no idea where I lived. A minute or so later a car pulled into the parking lot and pulled in behind me. I looked up at the clock. It was 9:00. The door was unlocked. The door opened and I stepped outside. The car pulled away.</p> <p>"Where are we going?" I asked.</p> <p>The driver got out of the car. I stepped back into the living room. A moment later a woman came out of the room. When I stepped in another car pulled up next to the old one. This time she stepped out first. As soon as she got in the other drove into their space, then came right back. I walked out the back door and walked into the kitchen. When I got through the kitchen doors she was standing at the counter.</p> <p>"What's going on here?" She demanded.</p> <p>"I'm here!" I exclaimed. She put her head on the counter and smiled. I could see her face was smiling also. She looked out the window.</p> <p>"Where ever is this?" I asked. The woman walked up behind her. I could feel my legs wobbling. She slapped her hands at my back a couple of times and moved in for a kiss. This is my daughter! I knew what she wanted but what would I do?</p> <p>"Who was just outside my kitchen window?" She demanded.</p> <p>"Jessica?" I responded her in a slightly more normal tone.</p> <p>This was my daughter! Her arms went around her body. She pushed her hands into my ass so her palms were covering my ass cheeks, pressing my chest against her. She kissed the top of my mouth and pushed her hips against mine, grinding herself into me. I felt a shiver run through my body.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" I asked again, but in my best Mom voice.</p> <p>"What? She wants to know about tonight!" she countered.</p> <p>"No...no, what did you just say?" I said back.</p> <p>She stepped back and looked me deep in the eyes.</p> <p>"I think I can guess...I hope," the young woman said looking at me. "Do you think..." She said. Her voice trailed off. When she looked up I had a look of disbelief.</p> <p>"I want to eat her pussy!"</p> <p>I looked at her in surprise.</p> <p>"Eat me, I want to eat her pussy," she ordered.</p> <p>"I want to eat her pussy!" I responded.</p> <p>"Okay that's over!" she snapped and pulled away from me from the counter. I moved to the refrigerator. I found a can of salad.</p> <p>"If you eat that you will eat me!" I demanded and moved over and sat down at the table. I grabbed a fork and ate her pussy. My hands covered my lap but they couldn't stop from touching my crotch as I sat there. It had become too sensitive. I had to put down the fork. The young woman watched me with raised eyebrows.</p> <p>"You are a dirty old man! What the hell are you doing? No I know that's not true," she said as she looked me up and down. "I think I can tell!"</p> <p>The man's face reddened as he looked at me. Her eyes turned red as she saw me looking at her. She walked over so she could slap my back a couple of times.</p> <p>"How are you so young? You sure do get a lot younger!" she said with a smile.</p> <p>"I think I am the only one who could possibly be this young," I said. I reached into the refrigerator and pulled out a cucumber.</p> <p>"No, you can't!" she protested.</p> <p>"This is my daughter, I think you will think she is beautiful," I said back. I got down at the kitchen counter while I waited.</p> <p>"How can she possibly be thisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
