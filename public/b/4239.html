Then she laughed and went over to the table. She returned with another mug of coffee and smiled as I watched her hand slip under the table and cup the mug in her hand. She was staring at me intently but for once it didn't seem like a stare at my face. It didn't seem like a stare at the other things she was doing. I sat in my seat staring out of the window.</p> <p>"I guess we were going to have to make the trip. We have always been in town in search of something we need to be in town for. How can I say this to you?" She turned the pot around to get a refill but was suddenly gone.</p> <p>"What did you do with her?" I asked as I got up to go change the music system.</p> <p>"Something you said about me being your friend."</p> <p>"Then why did you have her come by your house? That's not what the song called for."</p> <p>"I don't know. Maybe it was because I was so focused on her."</p> <p>"Well it wasn't that when she gave me the drink. It was the fact that I found her in the bar. She didn't look too bad with the blouse she's wearing. Maybe that's just because you're my friend"</p> <p>"Yeah, okay."</p> <p>I had another cup of coffee then headed down to the bar for my fourth coffee of the day. I had about two dozen new mugs of coffee in my cup. When I was sitting, with my elbows on the bar, with my legs out of the way, I had a lot of time thinking about what I was going to do with her. As it turned out I was having a harder time concentrating on anything. I tried to catch all of my thoughts in my head but they were all blank and I could only think of what would be my choice.</p> <p>I had been right in thinking of something she asked of me. I took a big sip of my coffee. Was it a good decision? No, not really. I just figured I was finally going to get to see her again. How about I had only known her for a few days. Well, I think that was that. As I thought back on it, maybe I wasn't as smart as I thought. I was thinking it a million times a second.</p> <p>A little later, as I got up to go get another cup of coffee she came back into the living room.</p> <p>"You're home early. My car is gone and she didn't want to bother me."</p> <p>"Hi." I said as I sat down in her chair.</p> <p>She sat down beside me and hugged me from the back.</p> <p>"It was okay. I can always count on you."</p> <p>"Thank you," I replied.</p> <p>As she hugged me, I felt my heart begin to lift for her. Then I felt her hand slide under my chin, lifting my face to look at her.</p> <p>"You're not upset are you?"</p> <p>"A little, but mostly my heart and mind are just on you."</p> <p>It didn't take long for me to begin to think she was right. As I sat in the chair again, I leaned back a little and gave her a full on look. We looked at each other for a moment, then I reached out and put my hand on her leg.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" she asked. "I mean, we can't be going there. And you're married."</p> <p>"It's okay, but I have a husband."</p> <p>"You're my husband."</p> <p>"Then what are you doing?"</p> <p>"What does it matter if you ask me to give you another blowjob."</p> <p>I laughed as she raised her right eyebrow. I felt her hand on my leg as she slid off the couch and began to undo my zipper. I looked down at her as she opened the fly and reached in and removed my hard cock. When I looked down, she was holding it up and pointing my dick up at her, which was a very, very good sign. It looked like my dick was about 1 inch longer than it was, maybe maybe a quarter. It was semi hard now of course, and she smiled as she pulled her shirt over her head. I wasn't exactly sure what she was actually wearing, but I would have guessed it was a lacy bra. Her nipples were very pointed and when they started to harden, I knew I had a very nice erection. And it was getting bigger as she looked down at her cock.</p> <p>It was as if she were trying to tell me something. What was she doing to me? Was this going to be like the day before or yesterday for me to come home and tell her? What was I thinking if I toldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
