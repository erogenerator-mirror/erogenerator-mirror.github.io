He whispered, "You have such wonderful breasts."</p> <p>He reached around and took my breasts in his hands and began kneading and caressing them with both of his hands. I closed my eyes. I moaned. I felt my vagina beginning to leak again. I was beginning to wish that I had been able to make love to him.</p> <p>We rolled toward each other and I could not resist kissing him again and again. I felt a tingling throughout my entire body. My legs began to tremble. He began caressing my face. I kissed him. My nipples hardened and my vagina began to leak once again, although no more copious. He began running his hands all over my body.</p> <p>I pulled myself up and turned to face him and began kissing him once more and then I slid down and got on my knees and began sucking his penis. It was a moment of intense intimacy. Our mouths met and tongues began exploring each other's mouths once more. He began running his hands over my body and I felt his penis growing. I could feel it growing hard against my stomach. I pulled him out of my mouth and looked up into his eyes and smiled.</p> <p>He smiled back and grabbed me in his arms and began thrusting into me with greater speed and force. I felt my vagina contract, my body begin to spasm and my own orgasm was upon me. We made noises as we came together. My body became rigid and he joined me in it. We kissed passionately as his sperm shot into my vagina. We fell back onto the bed and lay with my legs spread wide and his penis still inside me. We kissed again. He held me close in his arms.</p> <p>"Are you sure you are ready for me?"</p> <p>He said, "Yes please."</p> <p>"I would like that very much and I think we will continue in the bedroom."</p> <p>We were on our backs once more and he moved into position. He took me in his arms and began kissing me again. He moved his penis up and down my vagina in slow strokes and I could feel it rubbing against my vagina. I wanted it inside me, I didn't care that it was hurting, but I was afraid. He moved it around as well and I could feel a pressure build. I couldn't believe that I had made the decision I made.</p> <p>"I am going to come," he said between kisses.</p> <p>I squeezed him and squeezed him and he moved his penis back and forth over my vagina and onto both clits. He was going to explode and I just held on.</p> <p>He suddenly went stiff and his penis jerked in between us. It hurt. I could feel a lot. It seemed as if he was going to come everywhere. There was so much sperm in his penis, but I could feel no pressure.</p> <p>As he lay on me afterwards, I could feel his semen leaking from me. I turned to look at him. His lips were swollen and red and almost seemed to glow. He looked exhausted and happy. I could guess what was going on back and forth in the kitchen and what I hoped was going to happen when the rest of the world returned. He had made love to me. I felt guilty for cheating with my best friend. I wondered what my secret would be, but I was happy that I had made the decision to have sex with a different man in those few seconds between kisses.</p> <p>Later that night, we lay in each other's arms and were in no hurry to get up and head to the bedroom. I could still feel the afterglow of our lovemaking. I lay there on my back. It felt like he had been in there a while. We were like an old married couple. I could not remember when I last fell asleepâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
