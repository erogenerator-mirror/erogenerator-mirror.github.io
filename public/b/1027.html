The images still playing in his mind... the memory of being in those legs made his cock twitch. He had to get out of here. He had to calm down.</p> <p>"Yes," he managed to gasp out.</p> <p>"What... what are you doing?"</p> <p>"I was looking at some pictures of you and Mom. I'm trying to convince her to let me go home with her," Lance answered.</p> <p>"No. Dad wouldn't let me stay with you," she said.</p> <p>Lance looked in shock, but her hand held him tightly to the chair.</p> <p>"Please don't try to escape me. I know she would just love it. I won't let you!"</p> <p>Lance groaned and leaned back in his chair, eyes closed, lost in his fantasies. The images remained in his head, and Lance's thoughts were still racing. He was sure if he opened his eyes later, he would see her face and her eyes glazed over with fear. His cock was fully erect, but wasn't as stiff yet. He really hoped that he wasn't going to be able to cum.</p> <p>"Lance?" her voice whispered in his mind. He looked back over his shoulder to see her. She had her arms tucked behind her, and Lance could see her fingers in her hair, as though she were in a trance.</p> <p>"I don't think I can hold back much longer," he whispered.</p> <p>His voice was rough.</p> <p>"No," she whispered back. Lance saw the fear in her eyes. He heard the whisper as though she would wake from the slumber of the dead. "Please," she implored. "Hold me. Let me feel you inside of me. Please!"</p> <p>"Oh my God," Lance said feeling his cock twitch again. He had to resist the temptation to rub himself all over her beautiful, shapely body. He would have to remember every second of this day for sure. He really had to get some relief so that he could get some sleep!</p> <p>A voice inside his head said, "Okay. I'll go see if Mom will be up."</p> <p>Lance looked up out the window, and saw Mrs. Bickerstaff peeking out from behind closed curtains. He saw her move from her seat and walk down the aisle toward her seat where she was. He saw Mrs. Bickerstaff get a glass from the cupboard in one of the adjacent booths that led to her mother's room and stop by the counter.</p> <p>"Please, Lance. Please let me stay with you. It's not that easy. I know you still haven't figured out how to have sex with me yet," her voice whispered. Lance could feel the tears in her eyes as she spoke.</p> <p>"It would help if he did," she said to herself. Her voice rose in pitch, as she walked down the aisle toward her mother's seat. "Please, don't tell him!" Mrs. Bickerstaff pleaded with her.</p> <p>Lance could hear the desperation in her voice and tears in her voice, as she took all of her mother's hand and pulled her to her feet.</p> <p>"Mom, I... I can't. Please help me, if you'll let me stay with you for as long as you like," he pleaded. "I do want to stay with you, but right now I think I'm done with my Mom!"</p> <p>"Lance, I'm sorry. Forgive me. I think you should stay for as long as you want to. I will pay you anything."</p> <p>"OK, Mom, it's just that the next time I see Grandma, I'm thinking about you."</p> <p>"I know. We'll probably have to talk about it some time. Right now, I'm with this man and I love him," Mrs. Bickerstaff said to him. "But I think it's best that I stay with Aunt Melissa."</p> <p>Lance had the feeling that something was afoot. Mrs. Bickerstaff hadn't told him much about Melissa, since her Grandma had died. That had been a couple days after Melissa had died. Lance would have to wonder if he had known what she was going to say. It might be best if Melissa had gone with her now; they wouldn't have to talk if she didn't want to talk.</p> <p>He looked out the window again as Melissa's back began to shake again. His penis surged again, as he saw the expression of a woman's sorrow as she was suddenly thrown into another life and an altogether different ending. That's all it would take. He would have to think a little deeper and be certain that she would stay with her family. If she decided that she wanted to stay, he would be veryâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
