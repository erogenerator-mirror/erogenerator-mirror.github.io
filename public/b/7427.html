"You still like it don't you?" he asked her.</p> <p>"Yes, that was beautiful."</p> <p>"Thank you. Do you remember what I said to you?"</p> <p>"Yes... I'll remember you saying that if you like me now?"</p> <p>"What was I thinking?"</p> <p>"Nothing, come here." He laid himself on top of her pulling her to lie on top of him. "What are you thinking?"</p> <p>"That I've been pretty naughty and want to be naughty." She pulled the blanket off herself and spread herself out again feeling its warmth.</p> <p>"You are lovely." He kissed her. "That's it lay back and get more comfortable, you don't have to move or say anything to anyone." He reached down and undid his clothes "You'd better get some sleep. I have work to do."</p> <p>"Yes master."</p> <p>They lay down together and held each other close he caressed her breasts feeling their warm flesh against each other and knew all would be done soon. He got hard and climbed between her legs and slid into her.</p> <p>"I thought you said you wanted more?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes I did, I want more." He had her legs wrapped tightly his mouth and tongue working on her breasts. He slid himself into her wet hot vagina then began to rock slowly. He fucked her slowly getting faster and faster. Each time he drove his hard pole into her she cried out.</p> <p>"I'm not making love to you," he whispered to her. "I'm fucking and loving you."</p> <p>"Yes, you are making love to me," she replied. "I like how we are connected. I'm sure we can make each others love."</p> <p>Her own orgasm was building and she knew they had to go back at her own side soon. He pulled out of her.</p> <p>"Let's go back where we can finish." He got up and they put on a short dress. The day had gone by fast and quickly and they hurried back to town. Back at the apartment they showered and came back into the bedroom. He pulled her on the bed.</p> <p>"Do you want to do me now?"</p> <p>"Of course, we will be back in bed soon."</p> <p>They went off to get ready for his trip and she was ready and waiting for them to arrive. She thought she would be able to keep her hands off him after a while and get his motor running again at the same time. She was still thinking about her orgasm when he pulled up over the front of the house they'd been going to, parked and jumped in the front and drove back to the apartment in a cloud of smoke. The car had been in the garage and locked. On the drive over to the house she'd wondered if his friend could be over. He pulled up with a blanket on him and two women arrived in his car.</p> <p>"I'm so glad we found each other," she spoke to him.</p> <p>"Are you?" he asked her.</p> <p>"No I'm not. But I am going to keep coming back to the same old same old."</p> <p>"How long until your friend comes over?"</p> <p>"Soon enough." She thought she'd be able to keep her hands where they were and just forget about the situation. "How about I meet him in the gym?"</p> <p>"Sure, that would be a good idea."</p> <p>"You do want me to go there with you?" he asked.</p> <p>"No. I've waited so long for my first time. I'll be ready."</p> <p>"I want everything to be all right."</p> <p>"That would be nice," she said smiling as they went inside to find him sitting at a table in the exercise room. They talked about his friend coming into town and all that. Her mind was filled with all the things she had hoped to do but never had the chance. The thought of having sex with this man made her want to cry. It was too late now.</p> <p>The man who was with her arrived. She had met Mr. Jorgen several times but he never had the slightest interest in her. He was in his early forties and had gray hair that was very black and very sexy. "How long have you known me?" He asked her.</p> <p>"Almost a year."</p> <p>"Did you know where you were?"</p> <p>"No, I didn't know where I was."</p> <p>"I'm glad you came here," he said.</p> <p>"I'm glad you came, I've been waiting all day."</p> <p>"What day is good for you," he asked?</p> <p>"My day is always good."</p> <p>"Do you think itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
