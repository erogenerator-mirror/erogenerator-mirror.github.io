She sat back in my lap, her hands sliding over my chest. I reached up and caressed her breasts, tweaking her nipples.</p> <p>"Might as well get started now," I said, moving quickly and getting off the couch. I stood at the side of the bed and watched her, still rubbing her breasts. She smiled, reaching out and sliding me back to sit on the bed.</p> <p>"Do your hair," I said, standing up so her hair covered my lap. "I'll be over in a little bit."</p> <p>"You can't just stand here," she said, looking up at me. And then, looking down suddenly, she smiled and winked.</p> <p>"Yes. I'm going to."</p> <p>I leaned against the headboard and stared up to the ceiling, then back at her, my hand on the back of her head.</p> <p>"Let me show you how that feels," I said, slowly caressing her head. I moved forward a bit and leaned my face to her ear.</p> <p>"You don't have to, if you don't want to..." I said.</p> <p>"No, but I want to." She turned her head to face me. "Are you going to do this too?"</p> <p>"I think so," I said. Her hair made me feel more confident. I sat back down, turning my face to watch her.</p> <p>She reached up and ran her fingers through her hair, moaning, before reaching up to rub the hairless skin of her neck. I could see her eyes beginning to glaze a little.</p> <p>"Is there something we can do to take the edge of...," my voice ended abruptly, my voice ragged, "of this?" I asked. I saw her eyes widen in her head, and then her smile.</p> <p>"Mm-hmmm."</p> <p>I had to think about how to ask her to do something.</p> <p>"How about if we just...," again I paused, my eyes glazing slightly more, "ummm."</p> <p>"I'm not going to let you stop."</p> <p>"But, how about just doing the right thing?"</p> <p>"That's so important. I think it's okay."</p> <p>"That's okay too," she agreed but now seemed a bit more shy, a bit less confident. I started to think maybe I should keep it to a bit of a secret, but as much as I wanted to, what would the rest of the world think of the two of us being naked with each other?</p> <p>"You're right," I said, sitting back down again. I took her hand and started to rub her fingers. "Sometimes I don't think we're really going to do this."</p> <p>"I'll be the judge of."</p> <p>"And we're going to."</p> <p>"Good."</p> <p>I brought my head forward and kissed her. I felt her tense, but didn't make any move to stop it. Instead, my fingers traced up her arm as my lips parted hers. We kissed lightly, her hand gripping my shoulder. I felt something warm and damp on my shoulder, felt her hand on my bare skin, then her fingers running along my back. I felt her other hand running gently over my hip and up my leg. She had stopped touching my erection and now ran her fingers lightly up and down the shaft, making me jump a little.</p> <p>I brought my mouth back to hers and I ran my tongue in her mouth as she ran her fingers back down and back up. I let her hands go, and then pulled her so that her lips were hovering at my neck. She kissed me, her tongue darting out for the tip, then moving it in slow circles, her hands moving all over my body.</p> <p>I pulled back from her mouth to look at her as her hands started to unbutton my shirt. "I should leave, so I can take better care of you, you know," I said, smiling with myself. She looked at me, a little puzzled and a little disappointed.</p> <p>"No," she said quickly, "please."</p> <p>"I'll see you in a while."</p> <p>I turned and got up out of my chair. "I've gotta check to make sure everything is alright," I said to her. She looked at me, a little unsure, and I could see by her face that she understood.</p> <p>"Oh," was the only reaction I could get from her as I closed the bedroom door. It's funny.
