I got up to answer and found Sam laying naked on the bed beside me, holding my hand.</p> <p>"I had a surprise for you tonight too, my love!" Sam said and I could almost picture her naked, with a huge, round and very large black bush. "I brought the clothes out of her closet..." I said as I got up and laid the clothes on the floor. "I did a complete 180, and you'll have to wait until you see what you're gonna find, lover!"</p> <p>"A surprise like that..." I said as I started to pull her up and she lay on the bed with her legs open wide for me...her bush spread open...and me to see.</p> <p>I got between her legs and went to town on her nipples, kissing her and running my tongue around her areola...I pulled her nipples to the extreme, pushing them and licking them, then taking the whole of them into my mouth and biting them slightly. Sam moaned and raised her hips to help me with my sucking and licking.</p> <p>"Mmmmm, yes!" Sam said softly and I knew she liked it that way.</p> <p>I sucked and bit each nipple, which made her arch up against me and her breathing became more shallow and her hands were running through my hair. Just when I was sure she was close to coming I stopped.</p> <p>"I want you to eat me!" Sam said and I grinned and she climbed up and guided me in...her back to the wall, and soon she was on her back and I was inside her again and again.</p> <p>"Your pussy feels good on my cock. You know you like it?" I said and Sam turned her head and we kissed, gently at first. I moved up, pulling my cock out very slowly, until only the head was in. I moved myself back as Sam opened her eyes and she looked up at me again.</p> <p>"Fuck me, please!" Sam cried out and I drove myself back into her. "Yes, fuck my pussy, make me cum!" She started to cry quietly and I knew she was very close, too.</p> <p>"Oh, I want to taste you" I said and Sam started to move her hips up to make me push into her for her. I knew she wanted me to say what she wanted. I looked back at her, and Sam could see my cock through my face and then she looked up at me.</p> <p>"Put that black monster in my body...I...I want you to fuck me!" She cried out and I drove myself back into her, causing her wetness to run down my legs once again.</p> <p>"Yes, fuck me, fuck me harder...Fuck me!" Sam cried out as she came hard and it was as if my balls were boiling.</p> <p>"Ahhhhhh!!" Sam moaned again as she pulled me tight against her. I kissed her again as we recovered and we rolled up together in a soft embrace. Sam wrapped her arms around me and pulled me down into her warm and welcoming wetness.</p> <p>After a minute or two of tender petting we were able to say that we had a lot to talk about next.</p> <p>"How do you like all those presents?" I asked and Sam nodded. "I got everything and I'm sure you had more to add." She grinned and said, "Not very much, I did about half of them, but more than half is even." She laughed and laughed...and kissed me.</p> <p>"So...are you ready to be in love with the other person?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Oh yes, right now, I hope so, but in the long run it's a lot easier to not know what to do than it is later on. I'm still getting reacquainted with everybody that we're in love with." Sam said as she looked at me and then moved towards me and kissed me.</p> <p>"That was so nice, too," she said and looked into my eyes. The way the night just went was just fantastic, and my cock was rock hard when she put her arm around my neck and slowly brought her lips to mine.</p> <p>"I never thought of this as just...having sex," Sam said and then said, "but that's not a lie. You have a lot of experience with women. We'll have to try that with you a little later, OK?" She looked into my eyes and I nodded, thinking this was very unlikely. Suddenly, she pulled back and we looked at each other.</p> <p>"Are you sure I can't trust you?" She asked me, "Or you could try me, too." We said nothing, but we both knew the answer.</p> <p>I felt Sam's arm go around my neck and was kissing meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
