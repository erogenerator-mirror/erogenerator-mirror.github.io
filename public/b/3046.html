She looked at it and seemed a bit surprised at its swollenness, and with a slight smile, asked, "Are you ready to join the party?"</p> <p>I nodded my head, "Yes please," and she opened more windows, and I entered the kitchen. She got back, sat on the bar and started taking things out of the refrigerator, and then went down to eat. She sat back down at the bar, and I took the wine glass again and took a few sips. "Want some?" I asked, "I will pour you a glass when you are ready. You look so sweet and innocent. Do you want another drink?"</p> <p>"No," She answered, and I gave her another glass. "But please take me to the bedroom."</p> <p>We got up from the bar and walked through the house, looking into the other bedrooms. I had my eye on her bedroom, and she reached into the open door, and found a white garter and held it in front of her. She looked at me and smiled, and I smiled back. She said, "Here it is." And then went into the bathroom, where she turned on the water.</p> <p>When she came out of the bathroom, I turned off the lights and locked the door. I picked up the glasses off the bar and we started taking our wine glasses. I opened her wine again and put the glasses down, sat back down beside her, and she took a sip too. I reached out and took her hand, and as I did, I put my hand under her skirt. She lifted a leg and I got an ass cheek with my hand. I put some of the wine into her and squeezed.</p> <p>I put my other hand under her top, and she pulled down a little so I had access to a very nice pair of mounds under the teddy. She pushed the teddy out from her and took a sip of her wine. I reached out and put my hand on her knee, squeezing it gently. Her leg opened and I let my hand slide up the inside of her leg and over her panties. She said, "God your hand feels good." I started rubbing her leg lightly, and she started rubbing my leg with her other leg, and we were both breathing heavily. I took her hand off my leg and led her to the bed.</p> <p>We undressed each other and we each had to move back so we could get our underwear off. I removed her teddy top and saw a beautiful, dark pink nipple. I gently slid my hand under her teddy, and put my fingers in her pussy, feeling her wetness. She moaned, and reached down and stroked my cock. I moved my hand back under her and pushed her hand farther up and under the garter and pulled her panties to the side with one hand, and stroked her pussy with the other. Her juice was flowing, and she took my cock with her hand. I moved up her body for another round, putting my mouth over her nipple for a second, and sucked on it, then bit it gently and she went wild.</p> <p>I moved on top of her, and we fucked ourselves until we both came. I lay on her for a little while, and she rolled me over, and she lay on top of me, kissing me, as she stroked my cock. Her breasts were pressed against my chest, and as she moved, I could feel the weight of her breasts on my chest, and I reached around with my hands and pinched her nipples. Her arms wrapped around my head and we kissed some more.</p> <p>She said, "I want to taste you," and sucked my cock hard and deep and then licked and tongued the head of it, and then went down again. She tasted good, and I was surprised when she brought me to the edge while she was sucking me hard with her tongue, until I exploded into her mouth and she swallowed my cum. She made my cum, she licked and sucked it clean. I was surprised at how much she liked it, and she licked me dry.</p> <p>We lay like that for a long time, and eventually she got up off me and said, "I just want to go to bed, so we can get better acquainted." I sat up and took her in my arms and kissed her deeply and then led her into the spare bedroom, where the lights were off and she was naked. I lay face down on the bed next to her and we lay there kissing as I stroked her belly, then her tits. She reached down, stroked my cock and said, "Mm, I like it that you like it, too," and she ran her fingernail along the tip of my cock.</p> <p>We didn't get dressed, but just laid on our side, spooning closeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
