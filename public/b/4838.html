She gave my dick a kiss. "I think you're ready to give that to me now, now, baby, take off my skirt, will you? I know you're gonna LOVE this outfit, it is going to be fantastic on you, no better for me, no worse for her than you could ever imagine."</p> <p>I stood up and pulled the hem of her skirt up over her thighs. "No panties?" she asked in surprise. I turned her around and dropped her skirt back down, and it fell to the floor. We both stared at the dark triangle of silky blonde hair between our legs. "You like it?" I said in mock surprise. She didn't know what to say to that.</p> <p>"You know what I like, don't you, Laura" I said.</p> <p>"Oh, I guess," she said and sat down again, now a little more confident.</p> <p>"I like it too," she told me. I walked her over to a padded bench and sat down to wait. She looked down at my dick again, then back up at me.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" she asked, not really wanting to hear the question, but really wanting to hear the answer.</p> <p>"You bet I am. Come on," I said, and reached for her and put her down in the bench. She laid her head on my lap and looked up at me with those deep blue eyes. We hugged again, we kissed, and I felt her pussy quiver a little.</p> <p>"Are you sure I'm ready, or do you want to do this?" she said, not asking anything in the least.</p> <p>"Come on," I said, and moved us to the bench. It faced away from the other two girls so we were facing each other. I got the bench set up against the wall and Laura laid her head down in my lap on one of the padded bench's arm rests. She looked at me.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" she asked. I didn't really care, I just wanted to feel her soft lips and the warm breath on my dick before I put it inside her again. I felt it, the warmth of it, like it might be heaven.</p> <p>It was heaven, I know, but I wanted to be inside her soon. I had only been thinking about it for a minute or so, but I had to move the bench a little more. I sat my dick and Laura's face, our arms still pressed against each other, but she didn't stop me from moving her head away. I got the bench down to its normal position, I put her legs a little higher off side of the bench. Then I leaned over to her, I kissed her, and her heart did the same. I could feel her heart beat just a little, she didn't have a heart, but hers beat was very good.</p> <p>We kissed for a long time, I felt the warmth of her body, her legs, her chest, everything, I thought I was dreaming, just a dream.</p> <p>She moved her head from side to side, so her hair brushed up against my crotch. I slowly reached down and rubbed the front of her panties, feeling her pussy lips and her soft thighs. She got up and straddled my lap, her head on my shoulder again, I felt her breasts pushing against my back. Just like when we were young in the hot tub.</p> <p>When I felt her moving her hips up and down on my dick, I started to kiss her lips and forehead, on the nose, I ran my tongue along her brow as I was making the motion, feeling her eyelids drift down and back up and then back up. We kissed again, passionately now, tongues dancing together again. I rubbed her panties up and down on my dick, it got hard and big in only seconds, we were both moaning, groaning now, feeling more and more horny, wanting to feel my prick inside of her, so ready to cum, ready to go, I wanted this, I wanted this so bad.</p> <p>She got up first. She grabbed my hand and moved it up between her legs, and down to her pussy, she felt me slowly stroke my fingers up and down on her clit, she was wet, wet everywhere, I could feel her juices running down both between our legs and down the bench. She sat up to kiss me, then lowered herself to lie back, I felt the warm moistness of her pussy lips against my fingers, I slid them up and down between her legs, up along her thigh to her pussy, over and over, up to her lips, back down to her clit. She was dripping wet, I had to see. "Lie down baby, lay down," she said. I got up and looked over her shoulder. She was watching me, eyesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
