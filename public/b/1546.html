He turned slightly, still looking at Melinda's face, her smile still there as if it had just fallen from her eyes.</p> <p>"No," He said again. He took a step forward. "Let's do this the old-fashioned way."</p> <p>Melinda nodded and held her hand out for the bag. He did the same, and she took it from his hand. "Where have you come from?" She asked when he handed it to her.</p> <p>"It's all I can handle at this point."</p> <p>"I can relate to that."</p> <p>"There's not nearly as much you as there's the rest of you."</p> <p>The two continued their discussion about their life together.</p> <p>"Melinda," Michael began, "we're going to try again - not as well this time....to be honest....." He shrugged his shoulders and glanced over at her, trying to look serious.</p> <p>"I'm sorry?" Melinda sighed.</p> <p>Michael nodded slightly. "I'm sorry. This would all be so much easier if you were here. I just can't go without you this much."</p> <p>"Please do Michael." She looked back over at him, "Let's begin again."</p> <p>Michael smiled and walked over with her to his couch. He sat down, his cock beginning to stiffen as he saw Melinda lay on her stomach.</p> <p>"Now take the panties off."</p> <p>She raised herself up, her ass now at his eye level as she lifted the panties up to her knees, her face staring at him.</p> <p>"Hmmm, maybe I'll let it stay in there." He reached forward, sliding it into her wetness. Her ass cheeks tightened a bit, not nearly in shock.</p> <p>"Thank you." She said as he began to work the panties into her hole.</p> <p>Michael worked into his pants, and put Melinda's thighs back together again, placing his hand at his groin and smiling as he took his dick out. The two kissed slowly and passionately, not saying anything. Melinda's hand found Michael's shaft and began to stroke it. He closed his eyes to savor what she was doing, and smiled when she ran her fingers up the underside of his dick and into his balls.</p> <p>"Don't you want her now?" Michael asked as they kissed and caressed.</p> <p>She shook her head, "Nooo."</p> <p>Michael nodded. "Then take off that dress."</p> <p>Melinda looked at him and shook her head again.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Oh yeah.....yes." He looked at her, giving her an unreadable smile and holding onto the couch. She sighed out a breathy "yessssss..." as she complied. He lifted her hips from the floor as he sat there, his hand slipping down between her thighs with just a hint of fear still in his voice, "I think I'm going to be a very happy boy."</p> <p>Melinda's eyes widened in shock. "Just take you fucking panties off!"</p> <p>Michael laughed, and ran his dick over her ass again, but to his disappointment, her knees slid back and she lifted her head, pulling off her panties with them. They landed on the floor and he took them in both hands, wrapping his fingers around them and pulling them up off, his dick throbbing hard now as he stared at his girlfriend's pussy. She smiled and leaned forward.</p> <p>"Let me get these off."</p> <p>She turned back toward him, her eyes still on what he was about to do. Michael didn't miss the chance to look around to see if anyone else was watching them, but nobody else seemed to notice at all. A wicked look came over him as he knelt before his girlfriend, his hands sliding forward to fondle her breasts while he sucked her breasts in his mouth, the sensation of them rolling around his mouth like his dick was alive. Her nipples were hard and erect. He rubbed them, and Melinda moaned.</p> <p>His knees bent as he knelt before her with his eyes glued to her as he felt himself grow even harder. His balls drew up as his balls contracted, which felt incredible as she continued to stroke his shaft. Melinda pushed back against his hand a little, pushing her ass towards him. Michael grinned as he felt her slick opening, and began to stroke himself a little harder, his fingertips brushing across her clit as he continued to suckle her breasts.</p> <p>He slipped a finger up her, and pressed them against her g-spot as he finger fucked her.</p> <p>"Fuckkkkk...." He moaned. "Melinda....." He tried to look at her, but couldn't.
