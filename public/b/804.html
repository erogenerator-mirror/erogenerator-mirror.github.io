They drifted from the light of the morning sun behind her to the darkness of the night, just to drift off to sleep in an embrace that lasted an eternity. Her body felt good wrapped tightly around his, their skin making contact even just a little. He rolled on his side and took her hand, bringing it to his mouth to kiss it, tasting her lips and tongue. He brought her hand down between him and her, feeling as though he were caressing the small of her back, sliding down to her ass, kneading the flesh there. She moaned softly as he slid one finger into her pussy, moving it around, fucking her slowly at first, then more quickly, deeper and faster with each stroke. His dick, as hard as steel, pressed against her and she wriggled on him, seeking his cock inside her. He was so hard, so hard he could hardly fit his whole length into a cunt that just wanted it there.</p> <p>Linda began to move again, rolling from side to side on him, pushing her hips up on him. He raised his hips, thrusting a little upward in response to her motions, making her cry out, cry in lust, beg for more. He was hard again. She came again, screaming and panting, wanting more, pleading for him to finish in her pussy. She bucked against him, moving faster and faster. He groaned, reaching up to kiss her on the lips but she pulled back. He moved a hand across the top of his head and brought it to rest against her thigh while his finger started to stroke her again. They moved, he moved. She was so close she just wanted to explode again. He moved his finger down further, brushing against her clit just a little. He felt how hard it was. He knew it was the right time and place. He knew how to tease her, wanting to hear how she was feeling, anticipating how badly she wanted him. This was the time to do it on his own terms.</p> <p>She opened her eyes, seeing his dark hair, his eyes watching her the moment she knew she was looking at. He moved her hand and he started to lick her fingers. She shuddered in pleasure as he went to work on her fingers with the skill of a woman. She lay there in his arms, relishing every minute of it. He moved next to her, moving both his hands to her neck and kissing her neck and then her breasts, her lips, the tops of her breasts. He was moving down; she had no idea how. He lay back next to her where he lay. She was so warm and hard she felt ready to go again. She could feel herself coming to life, wanting him so badly. She was so hard for him, wanted, needed. She moaned. Her pussy was throbbing, wanting something inside her. He moved against her, pinning her hands beneath him, but he kept them above her. She could move them. Her hands moved, her body was moving against him, her pussy wet and tingling. Her pussy ached for his hard body, wanting to be held and be taken. He moved just a little further down, until she could feel him against her, his cock against her. He pushed down harder, just a finger moving against her clit. Her hands were moving, she was moving in response to him, pressing herself against him.</p> <p>"I want you", she screamed, as her orgasm overtook her. He heard her and he moved even closer to her, taking her into his arms. He held her tight, feeling her body as it trembled in passion and fear, trying to fight it. She was trembling, shaking, begging him. He held her, feeling her shudder as she gasped for air and let her body fall from the pleasure. He moved away, leaving her trembling and confused. She looked at him, confused, as he moved away. He stood there for a moment staring at her. Then reached out tentatively and gently caressed her left breast, teasing the nipple gently. "Yes". She whispered, barely audible, and he moved down her body. Her eyes widened as he moved in between her opened thighs, her lips wet and swollen and swollen. He moved his cock to her pussy, wet, engorged with blood. He slipped the head in, stopping before he was all the way in. He stopped. He took in her expression. "No", she cried, her voice choked. He started slowly in, letting her feel eachâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
