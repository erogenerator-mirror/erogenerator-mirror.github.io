Tom had a beautiful wife, which always seemed to be better than any other he'd ever had. He was used to her getting him off with sexy fingers, but she was still insubstantial. It made her that attractive, and her long legs were incredible!</p> <p>Sam was glad to see Julie leave their room, she'd have to get up the nerve to take her home in the morning.</p> <p>After eating and some wine, the guests returned to the living room, and Sam and Tom went up to join them in the kitchen, but Julie stayed in the bedroom for some other times. The next day, she and Sam and Julie were going to go shopping together, before being picked up and sent home!</p> <p>The day after that, Tom and Sam sat in his living room as they watched a movie, watching it as their wives came home from shopping.</p> <p>Sam asked, "What happened to you Julie, why hadn't you married?"</p> <p>Julie answered, "I guess Tom hadn't been a very happy man, that's for sure."</p> <p>"Julie, we have no kids, and have no right to be married to my cheating wife. Tom has said we must never get married again. You're cheating!"</p> <p>"I didn't cheat, you didn't get what yours did was my idea!"</p> <p>Tom continued, "Tom, Julie has to be a very convincing wife!"</p> <p>Julie said, "No! Julie has to prove to my husband that she loves him!"</p> <p>Tom laughed and said, "Well she certainly has, hasn't she?"</p> <p>"If she was, I'll bet my panties are wet."</p> <p>"Why don't you show them to him Julie."</p> <p>"Ok."</p> <p>Tom opened the nightstand, took out a condom and slowly rolled it on the end.</p> <p>"There. Now for some fun." He said</p> <p>Tom stood over Julie, took the condom off the nightstand, tossed it in the wastebin and dropped to his knees. He started licking Julie's pussy from clit hood to butt hole.</p> <p>Julie, surprised, said "Oh my, I never knew you were like this."</p> <p>Tom smiled and said, "I guess I haven't."</p> <p>Tom said, "Well don't call it fun. Julie has to know that your husband is still having sex in their bed and that I'm on the sofa with my cock buried in you. We'll get in trouble if you show him your vagina.</p> <p>"Tom, honey, I know you were really nice, you've wanted this, now, just relax."</p> <p>Tom started moving his tongue lightly in and out over Julie's clit, and up and down her pussy lips. He reached out and rubbed her clit with his thumb, feeling how slippery and soft it was. He could feel her juices running down his chin.</p> <p>Tom paused for a second, as he felt Julie's pussy clench down on his tongue and her body started shaking.</p> <p>"Let's try some of this." Tom said as he slowly pulled Julie's legs up and over his shoulders.</p> <p>Tom took the condom off his hand and handed it to Julie.</p> <p>Tom watched as Julie dropped to her knees and took the condom off and put it into her pussy. She spread her lips and slowly slid the rubber up and down her pussy.</p> <p>Tom sat down on a chair and let Julie work her magic. He thought for a second that maybe to make her more attractive to him, maybe to show him, in a way, her pussy was ready to be fucked, while in her mind there is someone else she liked very much in the world.</p> <p>Tom couldn't take it anymore, he started pounding her pussy, as his hips slapped against her tits, her face was buried in the cushion, and he moaned, "Jules, I'm about to come. You want me to pull out or come, do it in my mouth or come!"</p> <p>Julie didn't want Tom to come in her mouth, but she knew that he would. Her pussy was still feeling numb from all the action and she needed to come.</p> <p>And she could feel his dick getting harder and harder as she continued to lick him.</p> <p>Tom had to cum for a second. Julie's hand found his cock and started stroking him really hard and hard.</p> <p>He pushed himself off her as he came, and Julie was still between his legs.</p> <p>He pulled the condom off and dropped it in the wastebin. He lifted her legs and flipped her over onto her stomach. He leaned forward on the couch and put both her legs over his shoulders. He leaned in and started kissing Julie's ass hole. He tongued her rosebud gently as he lifted up enough for his cock.</p> <p>Hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
