He says with a laugh, grabbing us both and pulling us in for a hug.</p> <p>After that we are sitting, leaning against the picnic table, he's holding me, holding me, kissing me, rubbing my body with both hands, pressing my chest against him. I love this, it is a feeling that I haven't been able to fully appreciate over the years, but when I do now, it has this magical quality, every fiber of my being alive, and feels like it is the most wonderful feeling there is. He has me wrapped around his finger, and is running the fingers of his other hand over my lips, my tongue, my cheeks, on our lips, as it melts and dances over them.</p> <p>He pulls away, kisses me again, pulling me in close, holding me for awhile, enjoying the feel of me, the smell, the feel of my fingers on his body, my hands, his chest, all around him. In that time, time that he will not let us go, he takes two more steps back, leans me back, and I can feel his excitement, his hardness, his eyes dark with lust. His breath is hot on my ear, his hand, his voice, his eyes, and his lips, his tongue.</p> <p>He kisses my ear, and whispers softly in my ear the entire time.</p> <p>"Do you want to see my cock?"</p> <p>I nod.</p> <p>"Let's get him out of those clothes".</p> <p>I smile, my heart beating rapidly, my breath hot on my ears, as the feel of his hard body on mine, feels too good to pass this up, and he stands me around the picnic table, facing him. My eyes are drinking in every centimetre of him, all that is, is the light flicker of his erect cock on my skin-</p> <p>"Is that what you want, what you've been needing all your life?"</p> <p>My breathing comes in short sharp breaths, as I feel the heat of him on my body, and I nod again, feeling his hardness and hardness press into me. He moves behind me, pulls my shorts down, and my dress over my ass.</p> <p>"Look at this!"</p> <p>He's grinning, and I can only just manage to look at him. His face is just like those of his fathers, but his eyes are dark, his pupils wide with lust, his mouth slightly open, his hands behind his head, the look is just as hot as that of his father's eyes. I feel a jolt of excitement that comes from both, and I can see a shiver go down my spine-I don't know what it is, but I can see in his eyes, both look to want more, and it is both at the same time.</p> <p>He leans down, kisses me, running his lips over mine. I feel his lips on mine as he moves around, and I let him, but it doesn't take long for him to kiss every inch, as passionately as he did in the restaurant. His hands are on my hips, massaging my inner thighs, his fingers slowly opening my lips, running through my pubic hair, feeling the slippery wetness, before dipping in the way, and spreading me apart.</p> <p>His fingers feel around the soft flesh, as if searching for something.</p> <p>I am so hot, with his touch, feeling the blood pulsing over my body, the blood rushing down to my cock, as he makes it harder and harder to control himself. His mouth is close to my ear, as if to say, Oh, what do I care what he thinks, as if just saying "fuck me" would stop him from saying more. My eyes start to water, thinking he has said the words to me, "fuck me" before he had said them. Oh, that would be my first time, if he did, it would be the beginning of things. I'd never been this close to a man before, only once with him, and I really wanted to just touch him, to take his whole body in my hands and feel it, and feel how soft and smooth and thick it is as it fills me, and I think at this moment, it would be easy to simply lean in, close our bodies together.</p> <p>"Don't stop!" I whisper in his ear.</p> <p>He doesn't stop, his fingers are still in me, he pushes two of them in tight and starts to move them in tiny movements. The rhythm is driving me crazy, I'm almost yelling, but I manage to get out a quiet, "Oh! Oh!" as it just barely seems possible, I can feel him as his fingers brush against my skin on my bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
