I'm supposed to go home this afternoon and I thought if I got a chance of coming back here I should just go."</p> <p>"I guess that might work." She said with a laugh.</p> <p>"I guess," Sam said. "I mean, I'll miss you, and hopefully I'll have some time to myself," he winked and walked off with Amy.</p> <p>"Sam, there's something I wanted to say," Amy said as he sat down at the desk with a frown on his face, "and that's all it will take. If you want to make the trip home the way you have I would be more than happy to help you out."</p> <p>"I'm not going," Sam said. "We need to work something out."</p> <p>"It's not that Sam, but since you're not going, I'm not going," said Amy.</p> <p>"Fine," he said, sitting down in front of the computer. "Just tell me so I can start working on this."</p> <p>Sam started searching and found the last file under an old photo album. He took it out and clicked through it looking for any information that might exist on the story. He found many stories about vampires and other vampires that were related so much that Sam was even thinking about taking one to another.</p> <p>"I like this guy," Sam said, pointing back to the picture of a black wolf running at full volume, "maybe he's like that really."</p> <p>"I don't know who he is, and he's definitely not a vampire. But if that's the case, maybe you want to go for the real thing."</p> <p>"Do what ever you want. And no one is around to judge, I'm not asking you to kill them, I'm asking you to help me."</p> <p>"Fine," he said as he turned on his heel and started walking back to the main library.</p> <p>Sam sat there for a few minutes staring at what he had just seen on the computer, unable to believe what he was seeing. After a few minutes he sat down and started reading in frustration.</p> <p>"So Sam," said Amy after a few minutes of thought, "did you really go for the wolf?"</p> <p>"No, of course I didn't," said Sam. "I'm not like that... what did it look like?"</p> <p>"Come on," said Amy. "Why didn't you get back into your apartment to get yourself a suit?"</p> <p>"No, actually no," Sam said, "the wolf did what it was because he wanted me there. Plus it seemed to be something that someone liked."</p> <p>"But why?" asked Amy. "What did it look like?"</p> <p>"Weird, actually," Sam said as he ran a hand through his long brown hair. "Look I'm not that kind of guy, I just want you to be happy."</p> <p>"And there isn't anything you can do that will cause me to be happy?"</p> <p>"Of course not babe," said Amy with a big smile. "You are going to be the hottest guy alive. And besides, I'm not ready to go yet," she said looking over at Sam with a cheeky smile.</p> <p>"Ok, I've got what I came for," said Sam sarcastically.</p> <p>"Don't you dare say that again," said Amy. "I like your idea of being a cool guy."</p> <p>Sam shrugged and stood up. "I'm going to go talk to my mom and see what she wants with me," he said and grabbed his backpack and headed out the door.</p> <p>The rest of the day was a blur for Sam. He started by walking down the road walking past the library. It was still dark outside so he got a hold of his backpack to see how it was getting there. It was still pretty cool, it wasn't so bad he thought. By the time he grabbed the pack and started walking he had walked a good ten minutes and found the bookmarked section of the shelf to his right. He walked over all the books that were currently at the top of the shelf and found this one. It caught his eye and he picked it up off the shelf and started reading.</p> <p>After he finished the first chapter of this chapter he picked up the next one and read it again. He had finished the second chapter so he picked up the last one after that. By that time he was starting to feel guilty about being late. After all he hadn't been able to stay in school. After looking out for Amy that day he decided to try and make something of himself.</p> <p>"Hey," he said when he found Amy outside the library with her brother. "What's up?"</p> <p>"I have some really bad newsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
