It was like she was in a world of her own. She knew she had to tell me, but there was not what she wanted to say. It did feel as if the pain and the fear were real, like just a normal mother and son talking about their own fears and desires.</p> <p>There was no way that I could tell this woman that something as extreme as what we shared in our relationship would lead me to hurt her any further than I already had. And what if she didn't speak? What if there were more complications to be dealt with if she told me what she felt? What if everything I had said about her hurt her, because there was no way I could take away what I had just said to her.</p> <p>How do you tell the difference between a parent and a child in your everyday life, and what the difference between us in age has always seemed to mean? How come we only share more of our lives. How does your parents communicate with each other on every level? Does your mother know what a man and her might feel if I told her what I felt about her? Does her mother feel that she has a father who is willing to share her bed?</p> <p>I had never actually considered this before. I had thought of myself as just some young man. And I had always dreamed of having a relationship that would take place in my own house. But my parents never came to mind my thoughts.</p> <p>When I spoke to her one time about sex with girls, she was always shocked. How could she be interested in having sex with someone like me? And I couldn't tell her that. She would be disgusted and resentful, and even worse, maybe hurt if she ever found out that I was with another woman. Maybe her boyfriend would take over when he came home.</p> <p>She seemed like a child at that age, so maybe it was my inability to give her what she wanted or needed that made me do such a terrible thing as betray her confidence. Maybe because she could never find someone like me.</p> <p>I thought about everything that came to mind and it just seemed that I wanted to make love to her. That was why I had come to her. And she seemed to have other ideas.</p> <p>That wasn't what I wanted to do, but to kiss her, and taste her juices, and make her cum.</p> <p>She made all those questions that are so difficult to solve, and I was determined to know them. I had to make up my mind now. She was my wife and she had to come to me now. I had had my turn. But first time, first time is over.</p> <p>I looked at her, and she nodded.</p> <p>No. No. Not yet. I was not ready now for that. She knew how she felt about me, what I enjoyed doing with her. I thought there were too many questions for me to put it simply.</p> <p>She took me into the kitchen and kissed me. Like the most passionate woman I had ever met, but the kiss was not as intense as I had imagined it would be. I could see the fear in her eyes.</p> <p>She whispered into my ear, "Just to be sure, I don't really want to lose you, but this has to be a decision for us to make."</p> <p>She held my hand and kissed the palm first. "Let us decide what to do tonight. There is nothing you have to change, nothing you have to do."</p> <p>That was all I cared to hear. I just knew this would be a long and wonderful night.</p> <p>When I walked into the bedroom, all three of us stood in the doorway, both of us breathing hard.</p> <p>And then she stopped me with a look as she said, "We can do this."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"Let's just see what happens."</p> <p>"Ok," I said, and pulled her back down on my lap. She kissed my cheek while my hand slipped under her T-shirt. She was sitting so close, her breasts pressed firmly against my chest. I could feel their large softness as I rubbed them. I had never felt such a sensation in my life. I wanted to kiss her so much as a lover, the only way I could tell anything could be wrong with that.</p> <p>"This is so wrong," I thought to myself, "we shouldn't do this."</p> <p>We were now kissing for all of eternity. My lips explored her mouth with fervor and it was so delicious. She wrapped her arms around my head, feeling her breasts pressed firmly against my chest while our tongues intertwined.</p> <p>My hands went between our bodies to her skirt covered crotch. I undid the clasp and she stepped away from me to let my hand go to the hem of her jeans. I pulled down the denim skirt upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
