I move my right hand, I run my palm over her cheek, and brush my thumb over her lips in anticipation of her reply. In the end, we both go numb.</p> <p>I slide my hand back towards her mouth, her head lifts as my thumb brushes against her lips. My own body responds in a way I wouldn't have dreamt of. I feel the warmth from her tongue and press my thumb into her mouth a little more urgently. I hear her moan, as my thumb slips easily into her mouth.</p> <p>I open her mouth even wider and slide my thumb deep into her warm wet mouth. I begin to slide it in and out of her mouth while rubbing her tongue across my thumb. I can feel her warm breath on my hand on her face, the heat of her body radiating onto my forearm, through me as I slide the thumb deeper into her mouth. I feel her tongue licking it, the little wet bits coming back up against the palm of my hand.</p> <p>I slide my hand out of her mouth, and slide my thumb deep into her throat. The feeling of her throat sucking my thumb and tongue is exquisite. I slide my hand down her face and slide my thumb over her chin. I bring the tip of my thumb to her throat and push it slightly down before pressing my thumb against her neck. I press it down again, she swallows but has no immediate effect on her. She looks out the window just in time to see the taxi taxi take us to a seedy bar that has its own door, and not really to your surprise or dismay as it does that one when we are walking down the street. The taxi driver honks. I turn to her and face her again. My head moves down, so I can kiss her neck, then reach round her and grab her hand. She grips my hand in hers, and her mouth opens for air in a half-hearted attempt to say something.</p> <p>"Get it out of her, then." I say as I press the tip of my thumb against her lips. She doesn't open her mouth or move it. I'm enjoying this, getting her to open her mouth a little. I take her mouth again, and press her tongue against my mouth. My thumb slides out of her throat. I press it against one lip just as she opens her mouth to speak.</p> <p>"What about her?" I ask.</p> <p>"What about her?" she says, her mouth is half full with saliva.</p> <p>"What about her?" I repeat.</p> <p>"Do you want to watch her, watch her fuck yourself with your fingers?" I say and she nods. Her back arches as I take her mouth again, and slip one finger inside her, then two. I press my thumb against her throat now, making it harder to suck her own breath. I press my hand flat against her cheek, my thumb pressing against what I believe is her. I feel the wetness on my thumb that is being squished between her teeth. She has her hands on my wrist now as she moves her mouth backwards to meet my mouth. My hand moves to kiss her and my hand slides down her face and onto her neck. I feel my thumb pressing against the flesh of her throat, rubbing against it, as I press my thumb down into her throat and press it down inside her. She is trying to speak, to try to say something. I lift my face away from her and move to press my lips in a line across hers once more, before lowering myself to her.</p> <p>She resists me at first, so I press my hand to her mouth and press our lips together. I feel her lips opening for my tongue, which forces it against hers and finds it. The first time my tongue slides deep into her mouth. Our kiss grows more intense, our tongues twining. Our tongues touch and dance across each other's saliva coated tongue, as I begin to pull the hand which is sliding in and out of her mouth with more and more urgency. Her own arousal is as high as mine. She moans into my mouth and pushes her tongue back into me and laves my face and my neck. She lifts herself to me, and I am able to slip my tongue out of her mouth to lick her throat, around her jaw. I press my mouth to her neck and slide my tongue over the soft skin there, up and down.</p> <p>Her breath is coming in short pants. I don't know where one kiss went next, and yet we do come back to this one. I slide my tongue back as far from her face as I can, then slide it down her throat to her shoulder and back, over her collarbone, and across her upper chest.
