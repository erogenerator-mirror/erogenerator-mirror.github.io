She wasn't sure whether or not she had ever been with such a man. He was tall, dark, handsome with dark grey eyes, full lips and a small, firm body with an incredibly large round tits. He was a little bigger than her, perhaps a little under six-feet, and had very large, wiry brown pubic hair. His tongue was huge and curved inside his mouth, but with a thin coating of sweat, some of it on his forehead. He made the most of her.</p> <p>She pulled her hand away.</p> <p>"I'm sorry."</p> <p>"Don't, please," he said, sitting up and slipping to his knees.</p> <p>Sarah was embarrassed by his sudden withdrawal from her now. She didn't dare move away.</p> <p>He grabbed her breasts with both hands.</p> <p>He massaged both of them. She felt a jolt of desire run up her spine.</p> <p>"Mmm," he said, his mouth hovering above hers.</p> <p>He kissed her. At first it was an erotic kiss, but as she pushed her tongue further into his mouth he pulled away.</p> <p>"No, don't," he said.</p> <p>He reached over to a little desk drawer and pulled out a condom.</p> <p>"Don't, please. I don't want to..."</p> <p>He kissed her again. Sarah could taste blood on his lips.</p> <p>He opened the condom.</p> <p>He stroked his cock, waiting for his turn.</p> <p>He put on the condom.</p> <p>Sarah felt her panties getting incredibly damp. She was sure it must be because she'd been playing with her clit without thinking.</p> <p>"Please," she said.</p> <p>"Please what?"</p> <p>"Please do it... I need to come."</p> <p>"I don't want you to come."</p> <p>Sarah couldn't believe she was saying those words.</p> <p>"I need to come, dammit. Please do it."</p> <p>"I can't," he said, and looked at her. "Can't?"</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Yes. Okay," he said.</p> <p>He pushed on her legs.</p> <p>"No. It's too big. I'm too big," she said.</p> <p>Sarah's eyes pleaded.</p> <p>"Please, put it in. Do it. It's just a little bit bigger than I normally have. It's not a penis. It's a nice long nice fat cock."</p> <p>Sarah stared at his huge manhood. Her pussy clamped down on it.</p> <p>"Please put it in..."</p> <p>He pushed, but he pushed too hard.</p> <p>The small head popped past the first few inches, and then it began to sink into her pussy tunnel.</p> <p>"It's too big..." she said.</p> <p>He pushed deeper.</p> <p>He was thicker than any man she'd ever been with. He stretched her open more than she'd ever been stretched before.</p> <p>Sarah felt like she could explode, and he felt so good inside of her that she had no idea that she had ever been so turned on by a man.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck me."</p> <p>She didn't say anything. She didn't have to.</p> <p>Her body was his.</p> <p>He began to pump his cock into her.</p> <p>After a few thrusts Sarah knew that she was coming.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck me."</p> <p>"Yes, Sarah. I'm about to come," he said. "Do you want me to keep it in? I'm not going to stop."</p> <p>"But it hurts too much," she said.</p> <p>"It's okay, Sarah. You'll be okay in a couple of minutes. Just a little more. Just a little more."</p> <p>Sarah pushed her hips up.</p> <p>As she thrust her body down onto him her tight pussy took his huge cock in deeper. Sarah thought she could take all of it. When he pushed in even deeper, she came again.</p> <p>He held her tight to him and pushed his cock into her again and again until he almost couldn't go again.</p> <p>Sarah began to move again. Her hands ran along his back. Her fingers dug into his flesh.</p> <p>He held her close to him while she came. He felt so much of her and yet felt so much of her around his cock.</p> <p>She was losing her will to herself, although there were still moments when she didn't know what she did want.</p> <p>Finally his hands moved to her buttocks.</p> <p>He lifted her off of his cock and then pulled her down with him. He put his lips to hers. His tongue probed her mouth, and she moaned into his. They had never kissed before, neither of them had ever kissed anyone before, and when they French-kissed Sarah thought she was goingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
