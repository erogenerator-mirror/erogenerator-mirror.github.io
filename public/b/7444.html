Just push on my lips slowly, but not so much that I'm begging you for more.</p> <p>Dana: No, don't stop. Just do it.</p> <p>Dana moaned loudly and I could feel the wetness on my fingers as I kept rubbing on her clit. Her hips shifted forward until she had to move her hands to her tits to keep from falling off of the table. As my fingers slid over her lips, I pushed the whole index finger into herself as far as I could. She closed her legs and held on for the moment, letting out a long, slow moan. Her hand moved to her pussy again, and this time, I pushed the whole finger of mine forward as far as it would go...</p> <p>Dana: So I need to get my clit out?</p> <p>Dana: Yes.</p> <p>Dana: You like to go down on me?</p> <p>Dana: Mmm... Yes, but make me cum first.</p> <p>Dana: Ok. Keep fingering my clit and I'll let go of it when you're ready...</p> <p>Dana: Can I take your cock out?</p> <p>Dana: No. Don't be upset or upset with me.</p> <p>Dana: Ok, but put it back in.</p> <p>Now I had the finger all the way up her pussy as far as I could and then was completely in her. I could feel her lips and her wetness on top of the finger that I was so deep inside of her. I was amazed at how wet she was. Slowly, I pulled my fingers out, then shoved it back in a few seconds, letting her wetness coat my finger. After a few seconds of this, I pushed it back in, a little further this time. Then I pulled back, then pushed back in. Dana's hips began slowly moving back and forth. I could feel this whole time getting more and more wetter by her moans of pleasure. After a few seconds, she pressed harder against me, and I could feel that she was ready to cum. She opened her legs so she was standing on her knees, then slowly went back to her hands and her hips.</p> <p>I pulled my fingers out of her, and she immediately sat back down. She grabbed me forcefully around the waist and kissed me. She didn't move or move back and forth, but instead, she lifted herself up slightly so that her clit could rub against my dick. This only took a minute, and Dana was now practically bouncing wildly up and down on the table. Finally, she put her hands on each of my shoulders and leaned back, as if trying to hang onto the feeling. She was still holding on, but she started to lift each thigh up on each side of mine so she could wrap her legs around my thighs and rest her knees against my calves. I let my hands find her breasts again, then leaned forward to kiss her lightly. She reached behind her, found my hardness, and wrapped her fingers around it. She started to move her hips up and down. It felt great and I could keep my face away from her breasts, so I didn't kiss. I tried to kiss her face, but she pulled away. She stopped moving, and just held me down. She wanted that all out now. Then she reached behind me - her fingers were still working me up again. She moved a little higher, and this time she lifted her hips to wrap them around and over my pelvis. I could feel her wetness around me as she wrapped her legs back around me and her pelvis against my crotch. It had a nice little bump, and it felt so very good against my skin, and it felt great.</p> <p>Dana leaned back, and leaned against me. She reached around to grab my dick, and started stroking just the head to her own movements while we kissed.</p> <p>"You need to fuck me," she whispered into my ear.</p> <p>"Yes, I need to make love to you."</p> <p>Dana leaned back a little more with a smile, then looked in my eyes.</p> <p>"Well," she said. "Then I think it would be nice if we were to just be lovers, like I am now."</p> <p>"Well, that sounds nice," I replied.</p> <p>We continued to continue on for a while, but Dana leaned back and I took a little of the table edge on the way up and used it for an extra grip that would leave me more room for movement - and also just so that Dana had to move her hips and move my cock. I kept looking at her nipples, and down at her pussy and her clit.
