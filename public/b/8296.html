As I waited for the coffee to take effect Karen came from the house. She walked in carrying an oversized, cream colored bathrobe.</p> <p>"Are you sure you can't get some clothes on?" she asked.</p> <p>"I can try and make it before you leave, but if you could only get up to freshen up a coffee and fix us all some coffee it would be wonderful."</p> <p>Karen looked at me.</p> <p>"OK, let's go."</p> <p>Karen walked back into the house still holding her bathrobe. Looking over at me she said.</p> <p>"Can we borrow something to eat now."</p> <p>"We should talk about this in a bit." Karen said.</p> <p>Karen stood up and I walked over to her and we hugged and kissed with passion. Karen whispered in my ear and I turned to look at my wife, but did not see her. Karen got into the car and we drove down the street toward the beach. It did not take all of five minutes to reach the beach and the beach and we walked around the main area checking out the lifeguard towers and the diving board.</p> <p>"Are we really going to do that?" Karen asked.</p> <p>"Probably so I can help you get ready."</p> <p>Karen took off her robe and jumped into the water. I got out of my wet clothes and went to the side of the pool to wait for her. When she came out of the water I got out of mine and joined her as she went to sit by the bench down by the waterfall to soak. Karen stood up, grabbed her robe, a glass of wine and walked over to her towel. I watched her as she wrapped her robe around her.</p> <p>"God, I have missed you." Karen said.</p> <p>"It is nice to see you again."</p> <p>Karen went to the outdoor kitchen where she started dinner. I joined her at the table looking directly at her. I got the salad ready and we sat down to eat.</p> <p>As she sat down I picked up my empty glass of wine. Karen handed it to me as I finished my glass of wine.</p> <p>"It was nice to see you tonight."</p> <p>"Yeah you too."</p> <p>Karen got up and walked over to me and kissed me on the cheek.</p> <p>"How are you feeling?"</p> <p>"It will not take long for me to get back to normal."</p> <p>"Don't worry about that, I will be fine. It will take me awhile to get back into something resembling normal."</p> <p>Karen finished off dinner and joined me for desert. When we put the desert in the back of the car I asked her a question.</p> <p>"What is it?"</p> <p>Karen looked at me seriously and then said.</p> <p>"I love you."</p> <p>I felt my stomach drop and as she saw the hurt flash in my eyes I realized that she meant it.</p> <p>Karen pulled up the car as she got out of the driveway. As she was going into the house she saw me looking at her.</p> <p>"Go get your dinner and get settled in."</p> <p>After paying for our meal I followed Karen to our bedroom again. I took off my clothes and walked over to the bed. I lay down and looked at Karen with tears streaming down my face. Taking her hands she looked up at me and said,</p> <p>"It is going to be OK."</p> <p>"It has been a while since I have felt this way about anyone. I think it is important that I get a decent husband."</p> <p>"I love you."</p> <p>"I know."</p> <p>Karen took my hand and put it on her breast. She looked at me with tenderness in her eyes as she held my hand. I took over, kissing her gently on the lips. Before I could say anything Karen kissed me, pulling my head down until our lips met. Karen let go of my hand as she pulled us to the bed. We made passionate love that night. When we left the bed I saw that Karen had put her bathrobe on after she tied it around her. I got up and walked over to the closet and got out my camisole and put it in. I was standing there watching her walk into the house with my clothes on when I heard the front door close. Karen appeared at the door with a smile on her face as she sat down next to me.</p> <p>"I guess we will find our old friends later."</p> <p>"I would hope so."</p> <p>Karen reached over, put her arms around me and gave me a deep kiss.</p> <p>"I will be back tomorrow to pick you up."</p> <p>Karen got upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
