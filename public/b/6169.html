The other guest is a beautiful lady and I'm sure that we could get her to stay until nightfall and we could set a little schedule here to ensure that she never gets the chance again tonight. She doesn't have any other partners."</p> <p>"Well, if she does I'll get my wife out of the way," I reply but I can't help smiling at her for that comment but then I had to add my wife did have other partners who liked to party with other women and she loved it and it was only me I found out about when I saw her enter the room later that night with her husband. We had all sort of discussed the whole matter of her 'coming out' with me before and I had to admit that I liked the idea of her being with other men. "Now if you really want to know I'll tell you and then you're on her when you go home tonight. It will have to be a little more discreet." She smiled and thanked me. We got the rest of the beers and she went through to the other room where her wife was still in the mood to party. As we left the bar she gave me a quick kiss. "And for just asking, I was wondering how you'd like to fuck her. I wonder what a lovely woman you would find willing to do that for me."</p> <p>I just smiled at her with a knowing look in my eye.</p> <p>As we walked through the door we paused to take in the view of the pool, which was empty. She said goodnight as she went inside. I quickly headed to bed and in just a few minutes fell asleep. I wasn't sure if my wife was in the mood for a very special evening but I was determined to give her all the chance she needed to make her fantasy a reality.</p> <p>The next day I had a big presentation and I met with the CEO of the company that my company was negotiating with. He was the guy who was making sure that a very successful company has everyone in the highest position. He had already spoken to a couple of the people that we were negotiating with and they would be sending the company's top executive over to my office in about twenty minutes. My office was in the main conference room which meant that it would be right around the corner from our home.</p> <p>I got the room ready and was ready for a long afternoon. The door bell rang as usual and as soon as it rang someone walked across from the door and looked outside.</p> <p>It was my wife and she was wearing a red dress that I had picked out for her earlier and it showed off her large breasts and gave some great cleavage that was straining even though, I noticed her nipples were still very erect. She had obviously spent a very long time with the company CEO and so she had a good time. As usual she got back in front of me where she sat with a glass of wine. As usual I was in a dark mood and so I was trying to keep my thoughts of her to as far from the present as possible. As she reached into the pocket of her dress she removed my tie.</p> <p>"It is now 10:50" and I was just finishing off one more drink, trying to keep it between her chest and the chair while she got us another drink. I don't think anybody in the room noticed but we did but they were having to be kept on my mind and I couldn't continue to make myself look nice for the meeting. I couldn't focus on the meeting because of the tension of the evening and the champagne that she was pouring for me as she leaned in in front of me. My wife was a vision with her long hair tied up and her dress being pushed up her back by her breasts and as she leaned forward her breasts were squeezed tight against her dress.</p> <p>"Have you had enough champagne for one drink? My dear, you look lovely in that dress." She laughed and leaned closer to me to whisper in my ear. "I hope that we can get this far out of our system later, I have a lot of other clients to deal with." She kissed my neck and then she leaned back in the chair again to whisper in my ear.</p> <p>I could feel the heat of her breasts on my neck and when she leaned back I could smell the wine on her breath. As I continued to look down she pulled back and slipped her dress away, exposing her breasts to me. She had a very nice firm body and I couldn't help looking at her nipples while she drank her wine. I looked up to see that she was smiling at me and had her hand on my shoulder. As my eyes drifted down she had moved away from me to stand beside the chair again, placing my hand on her bare thigh. "Are you still feeling the warmth of the room, your arm is getting tired?" she said.</p> <p>"Yes I am, I really do. I'll have another beer if you like," Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
