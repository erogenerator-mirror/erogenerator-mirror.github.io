You know when you get out in the streets you go off like a little child."</p> <p>"Yeah I know but I do have a boyfriend and I haven't seen him so far." I told the girl.</p> <p>"Yeah well, if I see him I'm going to kick him out."</p> <p>"Maybe but I think it's time we put that one to rest, you look so young."</p> <p>She just looked at me for a moment. Then smiled, "Maybe when we get home we can try again."</p> <p>"I think I'd like that. Thank you for the coffee too." I handed the little girl her coffee cup.</p> <p>I felt a lot better, she looked up at me as I offered the coffee and took a large mouth full, she leaned into me and whispered in my ear, "What's your name?"</p> <p>"Paul." I said, "Is it okay if I call you Pat?"</p> <p>"Yeah I've heard it before so I guess I'm just going to call you my 'Pat'." She replied.</p> <p>"Okay Pat but no you're not getting off scot free" I told her.</p> <p>"I would never do that, you're so sweet and nice to me I've been thinking about you for years." She told me.</p> <p>"I have too, and like I say I just got a couple of weeks off and I'd like you to meet my sister, she just graduated last year and moved back here to be with her dad." I told her.</p> <p>My sister, who she turned out to be almost half her age, was still my sister when she was ten with a little younger man. We had never met and when I saw her the first time, I could feel a connection and my heart fell as I was reminded of how much she had meant to me.</p> <p>We chatted about our future and her family. I was thinking that Pat would make more of an impression on me in just a few weeks. This is why I haven't been with a guy in my whole life.</p> <p>After sitting down to my breakfast I made sure I was wearing my best white cotton skirt with a blouse that fit me like a glove. All my white silk panties were on. I had on a light blue button down shirt and that wasn't because of the weather. It hugged me like a glove. I was wearing a simple white skirt. It had little buttons that buttoned down the top so you could plainly see the black silk and lace of my panties. I finished off my breakfast with a mug of coffee and started for the stairs.</p> <p>As I was walking up the stairs, Pat called to me from the bottom of the stairs, "Do we need to talk in here so I don't embarrass you? Do we have to go through that door?"</p> <p>"No not at all." I told her, "I want you to meet my sister, she's already spoken to me."</p> <p>The four of us were in Pat's living room. She sat me down on the couch and then introduced me to her sister who I then introduced myself to like a second time. Both she and I had on our panties, stockings and heels, and we could just see our legs through our open legs. I'm not sure how Pat was looking at us. There were two of us with stockings and heels. We also had on the same stockings and heels.</p> <p>Pat spoke, "Paul, I'm going to be your date for the day. I really want you and I know you would like me. Can we still go over our plan?"</p> <p>"Sure, it's really not a date I'm not a fan of." I told her.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I didn't mean to break one of our plans. I'm really enjoying it. We're going to have some fun."</p> <p>"There's a little party on Saturday night and I'm sure you'd like to keep it a little fun." I told her.</p> <p>"I'm game with that." She said as she gave me a hug.</p> <p>We sat that way for a few minutes. Then I had one of my sister's boyfriends join us for a few drinks. By this time I didn't care and I certainly couldn't drink much or I would certainly get fired. I told Pat she could have a free drink, and that I would like to meet her boyfriendâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
