This night wasn't about sex, but it was about us. There's just no substitute for an actual lover. Just the right and proper love making was the only thing keeping her in bed. I reached over and took her hand and gently guided it to my rock hard cock, she looked at me with wide eyes as my hand began to work her pussy lips. With one thrust of my hand it had her legs spread wide as my fingers began to push inside of her. This was our first time ever touching, so there was no pressure or pain as my fingers worked her pussy, but I could feel my own desires growing as my cock began to harden once again. As I worked her pussy open and my fingers slid inside of me, another wave of ecstasy swept over me as I pressed my hand deeper inside, she gasped in a mix of pleasure and pain. I pumped her harder and deeper, feeling a flood of wetness around my fingers as she clamped her legs shut and began to shudder.</p> <p>I held on to her hips tightly as her passion built. Within a few seconds I felt her orgasm come hard as her body tried to move, and my own came with her. As the wave broke though we were still connected through our mutual orgasms, and she was breathing erratically as her body was still shaking. We collapsed in each other's arms, breathing heavily. As her breathing returned a bit she smiled, pulling me close and kissing me gently.</p> <p>I felt her hand run down my body, over my cock and balls. She slowly began to play with me, stroking and pulling me toward a standing erection. As I felt her hand rub me back I got a slight erection, not quite as big as what I'd been thinking about, but in a good way. As she held me in her hand she looked me straight in the eye.</p> <p>"I've been wanting that for so long. Do you want me to do something to you until you can't move?"</p> <p>Before I could reply I suddenly felt her hand wrap firmly around my cock and she stroked me gently, her body pressed hard against me.</p> <p>"You can do everything to me, anytime you want my baby."</p> <p>With those words, she leaned in and kissed me hungrily as my own hand slid down off her thigh. I could feel it under her skirt, her panties, and the wetness as I slid my middle finger between her folds. Her head rolled back with a gasp as my fingers pushed inside of her, opening and stretching her. She quickly felt the fullness of my cock inside of her, and she grabbed my wrist and pulled myself closer to her. Her fingers slid along my cock as she looked deeply into my eyes. I slid my fingers out and held them up to her mouth, telling her to lick them. Her lips stretched to suck the juices from my fingers and she began to lick and tease me with those wet lips and tongue. I felt her hands slide back into her panties where they had found my shaft and found it as well. She pressed the head of my cock hard against her opening as she slid the head inside. I slowly began to thrust my hips forward as I felt her relax her muscles so I began to slide further inside.</p> <p>I was surprised at how easy this was, it filled her completely. She was so wet. Her pussy clamped down on me, taking me as deep as she could when I stopped thrust. I pulled and pushed, driving her back onto the bed as I continued to thrust as hard as I could. I could feel the wetness that had covered me as I felt it run down her legs as she continued to suck and lick me and grind against me. I began to slowly stroke her body, trying to drive her through this, not wanting to spoil the moment as she let herself fall into the throws of an orgasm. She was moaning as her body shuddered.</p> <p>I leaned far away, as far as I could. I slowly slid my hand up her body until I reached her breasts. I pushed and held her so she could move on me, holding her close to my body. She squeezed me as softly as she could, pressing against me as I continued to thrust. I took her tits in my hands and began to massage them as she began to breathe deeply, her thighs pressing against mine.</p> <p>As she began to move, her legs pressed harder against mine and with a guttural groan, she began to move her hips against me as she climaxed, as she came it seemed, in a way she'd never done before. Her body convulsed, shuddered, and shook as I pushed into her. She pressed tight against me, wrapping her legs around me as her body convulsed at my thrusting into her. I felt her hips begin to move as well, thrusting against me as her body began to shiver andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
