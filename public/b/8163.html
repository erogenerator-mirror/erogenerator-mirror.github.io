We were offered another job and we came forward with it. I loved the job; the quality of my work really increased but my money came up too small. I worked at that company till late one day and I started working with the group. At the time it worked out well. I was hired and I could be satisfied. A few months later, I was with the group again but I couldn't understand much else. They had been getting into a routine in their lives so it just didn't add to my own.</p> <p>On my first visit, I was told by another guy to be a little girl to be taken to another room. I thought it was strange it was my first real adult room.</p> <p>'Mommy will be so sad if you are a little girl.' I wanted to say to mommy, but my mouth just didn't work. My words weren't going to get anywhere.</p> <p>'Please...please don't do it...it will be really good for you mommy. Don't be a dirty old lady.'</p> <p>That one sentence was it. I had no option. My lips could not do that. I couldn't stop my knees from folding.</p> <p>'Please...Mommy...don't do that...' is all I could say.</p> <p>Two days of working in the basement then a meeting and then a month later a doctor told me that my weight gain rate had reached two and a half cups. But this was before all the extra calories that were done. I'd be lucky if I could eat.</p> <p>It became the only job I could get. I was now earning my own wage and I used that to try to get back my normal life. It was easy work which I had in high school. It seemed that all my extra work actually brought me closer to my school.</p> <p>On my second home and in that long period where I was able to eat healthy, I finally got bored with it. I wanted to buy my own house and I wanted an all time servant of Mommy. The only thing that could come out of an auction house could at times be my own name along with my real parents.</p> <p>The only thing that I was interested in was women to help me raise. I was in high school and I had some very high self esteem. My opinion, even without my parents being a part of it could easily be ignored and the way I acted made me think I was more than just a girl.</p> <p>Being home alone and doing what I did was not only a normal job but very risky for a person like me. My father took me away from school and I had lots of things I wanted to do. I worked as well as I could to go to a decent school. I didn't think Mommy would make it.</p> <p>I had made my decision and for that I was grateful.</p> <p>When a family member I grew up with found out about my relationship with her, she was very upset. She was worried when she saw me work for someone else.</p> <p>'Are you going to do it?' she asked and I nodded.</p> <p>She saw the look on my face and she asked me,</p> <p>'Are you going to marry this woman? Your Daddy? She wanted to know if you wanted to. Are you going to be Mommy's maid?'</p> <p>I was in shock by her questions. In just the last couple days, I was so excited I could not even imagine what it might be like for my first day working at this new job that the idea never even occurred to me. I started to think that it might be wrong to ask another woman.</p> <p>I had not given it time to reconsider.</p> <p>With my decision made, I gave everything I had and everything that I did to her. I made it plain that I would be happy working as my Mother's maid. She was very glad to hear that and she told me that her happiness was the only thing that I loved about her.</p> <p>It became the only job I could have, I got up at night to do my chores. Even if I did them on the hard floor, I thought I wouldn't want to put much weight in on it. Even so, they proved to me that what I was really doing was good for my skin. And besides, it was what I needed to do. Being independent really made me appreciate being a girl who worked in a house. My other job involved cleaning and cleaning houses and they didn't seem to take much care. I didn't want them to.</p> <p>A couple days after I finished working that one job, a friend brought it to me. She suggested that if I wanted to work at the club, then I could get a job there. I thought she meant to get into a sorority and I was happy to have a chance of being aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
