This is your first meal, after all, and you'll be all right when you get back to your room." I laughed.</p> <p>"Yes, Mr. White, it is. I thought we might get out of your schoolhouse today."</p> <p>But I had already begun to wonder if the girls in my home town would come to my home for lunch, the girls who used to be my students had left me in tears earlier with no choice but to accept them as long distance cousins. I hoped one day, one of them would ask me for my advice when the opportunity arose.</p> <p>************</p> <p>"Hi, David." I turned sharply toward the smiling face greeting me from across the room. There, sitting next to me on the sofa was Melissa, smiling and shaking hands with her school principal. Her skirt was up and I could see she was wearing pink panties and a tight sweater.</p> <p>"Mr. White, I guess I made you uncomfortable?" Melissa giggled as she shook my hand, which was not as soft and warm as she had intended it to be. Her large round butt pressed up against my leg and I felt a stirring in my loins as her firm breasts pressed against my arm and her soft pink lips found their way to my earlobes. "Let me go get you something to eat, David. I can't wait for you to be back." I looked at her and could see a little blush on her cheeks, a small smile on her lips and her eyes sparkling. I wasn't able to resist her.</p> <p>I stood up and began to walk toward her and my jaw dropped when she said; "Wait just a minute, Mr. White. I want to sit for a while with you so that we can talk."</p> <p>"Okay, Melissa, but just one more thing first." I pulled a small paper bag from behind the sofa. "These are your underwear, not yours." She looked horrified as I pulled some panties out of the bag along with a pair of white cotton panties and handed them to her. "That's good, but I don't want to start with your bra. I like young girls wearing panties much better, and I like my hands a lot better."</p> <p>"I guess it isn't that obvious. You know, David, you are definitely the prettiest girl I have ever seen and I think I could keep you all to myself." She smiled brightly at me.</p> <p>"Thank you, Melissa. There's also something for you in the locker room if you would like." I pulled two folded up panties from the bag. "Here, lay these on the coffee table." I handed one pair to her and she picked the other pair out of the pile in front of her, then I took her panties and laid them on the seat of the sofa. "That was awfully nice of you, Mrs. White." She was blushing. I thought she might run. I also wondered if she might want me to eat her too.</p> <p>We sat silently for a while, my hand in hers, studying her eyes as they turned from the principal, to the TV, to Melissa and back again and back again. When we had all our food in front of her, she leaned forward and kissed me on the forehead as she whispered: "Thank you, that was very nice." Her kiss was tentative, but as I returned it, it became a lot more intense.</p> <p>When we were done eating, Melissa turned her attention to her friends. "Melissa, I don't know if I'm even going to be able to get through the rest of the afternoon without falling down on you." She giggled as she picked up her panties. "I don't know if I'll even be able to walk straight in two weeks." She leaned back down toward me.</p> <p>"Well, I'm sure you will find out, young lady."</p> <p>She did look at me in a way that I couldn't quite describe. She was beautiful, tall and slender with a face that was very pretty, without being vain. She had long lashes that seemed to trace around her cheeks a lot when she smiled and her dark eyes held an exotic nature. She had a slim, almost delicate voice. I wondered if she had any children and wondered about her background. Perhaps she had one, but I would have bet that none of the girls from my school would ask her about it.</p> <p>"Can I ask a question, Ms. White?" I smiled.</p> <p>"David, please do," she smiled. She had already pulled out a pen from her small purse and had scribbled something down on the paper that she had placed there. "I just wanted to say, I'm not quite finished with our conversation now. I don't want to ruin your evening or anything like that."</p> <p>"I know.
