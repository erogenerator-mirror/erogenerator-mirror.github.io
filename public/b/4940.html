He said.</p> <p>"Yes. It's what I'm here for. I think I'll be a very good whore." She replied.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"I want it. For you."</p> <p>"What did you mean?" He asked.</p> <p>"I mean, you can make me your whore forever," she said staring at him as she held his hair. "Make me your whore forever."</p> <p>"No, you're not!" He said. "You're a whore. I love you for it."</p> <p>She laughed. "It's funny." She said as she turned her back and began lowering herself down onto him.</p> <p>She gasped as she looked down and saw his hands coming back to the head of the bed. She looked back up into his eyes. He held on to her hips and held her tight. She could feel his hot breath on the side of her breast. Her eyes closed. She could feel him pulling her hair. She could feel his lips against hers as she moaned. He kissed her tenderly. She closed her eyes. She could feel his hardness against her, as she lay flat on top of him.</p> <p>This was his woman! He thought. This is my woman! Here lay in his bed with him! She's in his arms! He felt the strength in his arms as he pulled her toward him in a slow steady move. It was a slow move that she used for self-gratification. His cock had never been a hard, pulsating, hard as it was, and it seemed to grow. He was getting a hard on right in his shorts, as he held her.</p> <p>"Fuck me!" She hissed as she lifted herself up. The kiss was long and hard. As one was, they were both in the same mood they both were. The passion of the moment was in synch with an urgency to cum. She needed the hard, fast, deep fucking that her body was craving.</p> <p>The pace of her movement became more vigorous. His hand found her breast.</p> <p>"I love the feel of your firmness in my grasp."</p> <p>"Ahh, I love it. I love fucking you."</p> <p>"Do it! Give it to me!"</p> <p>Her back arched against his strong, muscular chest.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, baby. Yeah! Yeah!"</p> <p>She moaned as she felt the tension of his cock between her thighs as it rose as high as possible. She could feel it's heat against her belly. She could feel it's power as it rippled along her legs. Their bodies were on fire and she was on the very brink! The passion was more than she could bear! The way his long, slender cock rammed her pussy while his hands held open her ass, made her realize that there was no turning back.</p> <p>"Oh, Oh, yes!" She cried out as he pounded his cock into her pussy for all that she had right now.</p> <p>The pace had increased. In the midst of it all, she was going into full, screaming orgasm over and over again! With each thrust she could feel her body's entire muscles tighten and release. She could think nothing and feel nothing except for the burning in her pussy! The pleasure was too strong for her.</p> <p>"Oh, Oh, YES!" She cried out as the first wave of passion struck her.</p> <p>She didn't expect the way things went from there. She just kept riding him as her body seemed to come down from its long-awaited climax. She was still in the midst of it when he finally pulled out of her. She felt his cock leave her pussy. The emptiness, the pain mixed with the lust she had felt earlier, she cried in frustration. She couldn't even move her hips, they were so sore! She wanted to feel that cock again. She wanted it inside her.</p> <p>"Oh, baby, you're so wonderful!" He said as he pulled her up off the bed. She felt his cock slip away from her once more. He bent down and pressed his lips against hers. They kissed for a long time.</p> <p>When they released from one another, they looked at each other. They were both satisfied and the fact that he could cum with the same force as she did that time made it that much sweeter! She could hardly tell how satisfied she felt, as she lay on top of himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
