I reached around him to pull him up.</p> <p>"No, no. I wanted to fuck you," he said.</p> <p>"Okay. Fuck me, Jason. Fuck me. Fuck my pussy," I said. I put my hands on his ass and drove my cock into him in one, then went all the way in. I fucked my best friend's best friend. I was fucking him because I like getting a blowjob. I'd done this since I turned seventeen. I had no idea if this would be any less fun or worse than having my first real cock fuck me. My dick didn't care. I pounded his ass with every ounce of strength I had left. We were both gasping and cumming.</p> <p>"Shit. Oh, shit," he said. "Fuck, your cock feels good," he said. I was close myself. I pulled out, and stroked my rod. I came, and I came again. Then I got my clothes together and slipped out the hotel room door.</p> <p>"Wait," I said. I didn't know what to think about what happened.</p> <p>"What? What happened?" he asked.</p> <p>"I thought we should talk," I said.</p> <p>"I thought you'd better talk. Did I say something wrong?" he asked.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p> <p>"You really liked me when I sucked your cock. Did it turn you on, baby? Do you like to suck cock?"</p> <p>"I like sucking cock."</p> <p>"Good," I said. I picked up my briefcase and walked into the room.</p> <p>I put on latex gloves and grabbed the suitcase. I got a robe on and checked my appearance in the mirror. The outfit really did look good. No way was I going to walk back inside the hotel room and have Jason take me out. I looked in the mirror again and could see my mouth agape. 'Oh, Jason,' I thought. 'I'll fuck him.' I opened my suitcase and checked out. The suite had a king-sized bed and a desk. I turned to look at Jason.</p> <p>"What if we let this happen? Will you let me...?"</p> <p>"Yes. Yes, Baby, I'll let you. You're such a good little fuck toy. Let's have some fun."</p> <p>He just stood, then kissed me. We kissed and it got harder. I turned around, pulled the robe off and threw it on the bed. It went on for a second as we stood on the bed, then I ran my hands over his ass and gave a little squeeze. We broke the kiss so he could get dressed and we had a chance to talk about me. I did a quick, hard, open handed job, then we were off to the bar. As we walked in, Jason said, "We've got some time. You go sit on the sofa while I go do my business. I'll meet you in the bedroom in fifteen minutes."</p> <p>I felt like a teenager, feeling horny from a half hour of sex with someone I didn't know. I was drunk from all the fucking, but I didn't care at all. I stood there, while Jason went around the room. He put a little make up on me. He put a big, wicked grin on his face as he did this. He had a little bit of a clown look.</p> <p>We sat in the lounge, and I made sure to sit on the sofa to give him room to sit next to me. He sat down on the other side of me and we just kind of kept looking at each other and I just got hornier that was, as he continued acting like it was the first time.</p> <p>When we were alone in the bedroom I saw a set of lights come on in the corner. "Who could that be?" I said to myself. I had no idea what was going happen. We had just got done fucking, but I didn't know what to expect. My fears were unfounded. Jason sat next to me on the settee, and I said, "That's my sister. She's the one that caught our attention."</p> <p>My suspicions were instantly confirmed. My sister was actually there. The look on her face was unbelievable! "Wow! Are you two OK?" I asked Jason.</p> <p>"Yeah. We're cool," Jason replied. "Now I should be going. I'm tired."</p> <p>I got up and watched Jason walk out the door as he walked away from me, then I went over to him. I put my arms around him and held him gently. He was so tired I hardly noticed that he fell asleep beside me. We spent the rest of the night just cuddling each other, kissing and caressing. When it was time for him to go, I said that I wouldn't beâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
