She was wearing a tight pink button-up cardigan shirt that accentuated her smallish breasts. She had a red skirt, but it was knee-length with long sleeves, and a button below the shoulder. A very short pleated skirt with dark-blonde stockings. She had one knee cocked out, with the toes of her black high-heels sticking up and I had a sudden sense of déjà vu. She was gorgeous, and I could not resist her eyes when she looked me up and down again. She was a sight that I would never forget! Her long brown hair framed her pretty face beautifully.</p> <p>Her body was well-toned, but she had to have known that under the loose cardigan. My cock had risen to the occasion, having just walked into the restaurant and was slowly rising in spite of the soft material clinging to it. I was in control of the scene with no conscious thought! The fact that she was standing there in a business suit and that she was gorgeous really made me feel powerful.</p> <p>She put her hand out to me with a soft smile, and I reached out for the wine and took a sip. She took my hand and gave me a very sensual kiss. It lasted longer than the rest of the evening. I felt a little like a kid again with her lips pressed to mine, and a warm feeling that I had not experienced in years.</p> <p>When we broke the embrace, she held me close. "You aren't that hard to see," she smiled. "You look good," I grinned. "Thank you."</p> <p>"You don't waste time, I have to hurry," she said, with a slight bow of her head.</p> <p>We made our way out of the parking lot, and had a coffee when I stopped to look at the town around us. It was a little cloudy with no mistaking that we were walking along the streets, but the sky was still clear enough for me to feel the heat of the day. We had a cab waiting outside, that I paid in advance by accepting a twenty and a change of fee.</p> <p>As soon as the cab left the sidewalk by the sidewalk, she reached out to me again and grabbed my hand and stood on her tiptoes to give me an open mouth kiss. She was wearing lipstick and no perfume. The fact that she was dressed so provocatively was alluring. Her lips were full and sensuous, not like those of the actress Jennifer Lopez, or like that of my sister Christie. Her lips were moist. She sucked my lips and licked my cheeks with her tongue. I reached out for her waist and started unbuttoning her blouse, as her hand slid off my tumbler. My hand slipped around the curve of her waist and under her arm to caress her soft skin.</p> <p>I slid my right hand up her skirt, across the soft skin of her ass and up her inner thigh until it found her panties. She pulled her arm through mine and reached behind her to pull my hand to rest on her breast. As soon as I touched her soft flesh, she spread her legs so I could feel the texture of her stocking beneath my fingers. I slid my hand all over her soft skin and felt the fullness of her breast under my palm. Her nipple was hard against the fabric of her bra and the outline of her breast seemed to push into her chest, as if begging to be cupped. It almost looked painful as if it might come through the bra.</p> <p>Our lips pressed together for a long moment, and then she pulled back and leaned over to whisper something in my ear. When I turned away, she leaned toward me and whispered something else. After a few seconds, she leaned back to look me directly in my face and said: "I want to be your first, I want to watch you masturbate over my friend's breasts, right in that red dress that she's wearing. But if you don't want that, then you must leave right now." She kissed me on the mouth again.</p> <p>My tongue slipped past hers and slid into her mouth. I could feel her warm breath on the inside of my cheek before her hot mouth met my own. We kissed while our tongues danced together, first in her mouth and then in mine. My hand had found its way under her sweater and was lightly caressing the warm skin of her breast above her low-cut bra. The softness of her breast felt so good around my hand. When I touched her nipple, the smooth flesh felt incredibly soft against my palm. It felt as though her skin had a soft, slippery quality—which was very unlike the softness of her lips, or her lips, that she always seemed to hold back in response to kisses and when they were not. She began moaning at the touch of my fingers—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
