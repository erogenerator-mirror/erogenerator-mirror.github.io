This was my wife. "Do the same."</p> <p>The dildo was still pressed into my pussy, but so turned on as it stretched me. The vibrator was still inside, sliding into the other side of the dildo on one side.</p> <p>I pressed my knees up as far as possible and reached back with one hand to hold my ass, and the other to stroke my cunt, now wet with anticipation, but aching for more.</p> <p>It was so exciting, so erotic, and so forbidden, so taboo I couldn't tell you if I liked it or not. But my excitement level, my anxiety about it, was rising.</p> <p>Mistress was in front of me now, standing up between my parted legs, her long, hard black cock jutting slightly upward toward me. My legs were spread even wider apart. I held onto her hands, my fingers sliding down toward my thighs.</p> <p>There in front of me. My eyes were locked in on her stiff cock, and my own cock, throbbing in my panties. The anticipation built in me, swelling from the inside out.</p> <p>"Look at me," she said softly, my eyes locked on her shaft. "Show me how much you want my dick."</p> <p>Hesitation and hesitation. My husband's dick is long, hard and pink. This girl's dick is really thick.</p> <p>I nodded and took another breath. I wanted it, wanted it, needed it.</p> <p>My gaze dropped back to her long penis, standing out from her body, and I reached out to touch it. My hand barely wrapped around it, and I could have wrapped both hands around it for all I knew.</p> <p>"Oh! Oh, my God!"</p> <p>I let my hand drop away from my pussy and reached down to the base of her shaft. I touched my lips gently, feeling that it was soft and pliable, as I had promised him.</p> <p>What's my husband got, now?</p> <p>"Touch him," I whispered. I wanted him to put my fingers inside me, feel my pussy.</p> <p>"Is this okay?" he said, a bit uncertainly. "Does it feel good, Mistress?"</p> <p>"Do it. Rub yourself on me."</p> <p>He hesitated. I was watching his face as I reached out to my hand, cupping his cock in the palm, feeling its hardness. I heard myself say.</p> <p>"Mistress likes it when you touch her cock," I said softly, my hand still holding her shaft. "Do it."</p> <p>Without turning, I pushed my middle finger down, feeling the smooth head in one hand, feeling the pressure of the big vein, feeling its length and its heat. I opened my hand and let him feel how I touched myself, felt how hot and wet I could be.</p> <p>"That's good," I said, "Keep doing that. Don't stop."</p> <p>He let himself feel it. Her skin felt warm. And hot.</p> <p>"Look at me, baby. Watch me masturbate for you."</p> <p>I let my gaze slide back down to her swollen head. My husband's cock is big like it, a fat black pole that I love to see. It's like a monster, so wide and big and thick, just for me.</p> <p>"Oh, my! Look at me," I said, my fingers running over the purple tip as my eyes kept returning to her face. He kept touching himself. We were both touching each other. He was stroking himself, and I was. I wanted to be touched that way, just the way he wanted me to touch my cunt all night.</p> <p>"Your wife touches me all the time," I said, and looked down. My eyes met his as I touched mine and let my hand go down to cup his full cock, feeling it under my hand, feeling him twitch and grow a bit.</p> <p>The thought of him with me excited me even more. I wanted to feel my fingers inside him, feel him cum inside me, his balls tightening and his dick throbbing, throb deep inside me as he held my hand, his eyes closed, his mouth open in pleasure. As I slid my hand down, I could have held him forever.</p> <p>I felt his fingers, the back of my hand, sliding over my palm as I let him touch me. I could almost feel his hand on my skin, and the muscles of his stomach, on my skin, in my hand.</p> <p>"Touch me, please. Touch the inside of my cunt. Please."</p> <p>"Please what?" He was holding my hand and watching me as I touched him.</p> <p>"Use me, Mistress. Please."</p> <p>"Where do you want my finger? Here, you can have it first."</p> <p>Heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
