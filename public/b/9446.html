I kissed his cheek and walked him out.</p> <p>"Here is the key to my bedroom."</p> <p>A few steps away we said good night and I closed the door as he left.</p> <p>My pussy quivered as I walked into my room. I could picture the naked man I had just had tonight standing next to my bed and his cock hard as a rock. I felt my hand trembling and went to get me a pillow and blanket. I was about to wrap the blanket around me when he opened the door a tiny bit and came in carrying a large box.</p> <p>"Thanks for the fun."</p> <p>I got some clothes from the room and put everything on as he started to walk down the hall to the bedroom. I was still shaking but not much. As we went to my room he placed his hand on my stomach and began to stroke me. I felt so good. I knew he would come back anytime.</p> <p>"So, how about we do something to start off our trip."</p> <p>I wasn't as sure what he meant.</p> <p>"No, I like what you're doing. Maybe we should try some other positions first?"</p> <p>"We've been married for a year now. You've certainly been able to take care of yourself. Are you ready to try some new positions?"</p> <p>Without a word I closed the door and put the box down on the bed. I was getting horny feeling the blanket. He dropped down, took me in his arms and continued to stroke me. He pushed my top up under my tits as his mouth and tongue went out licking the nipple and just kissing my tit. As he licked, sucked and kissed my tit I could feel myself getting wet as his cock grew hard and began to rub in between my legs.</p> <p>"Are you coming for this?"</p> <p>"Yes," I told him in the same little girl voice as before.</p> <p>I felt him pull my top off and I threw it on the dresser. I could feel my tits sway in his hands as he slid his hands under my bum, his lips left my nipple and began to kiss its sensitive skin. This sensation sent bolts of electricity throughout my body. I closed my legs but let him continue.</p> <p>I couldn't believe what he was doing! I had never been so turned on before. When he stopped, he kissed his way down my stomach and my fingers felt his teeth pull my pussy lips apart. He moved my legs until they were around his neck and I could feel his tongue on them. He was going to take me like this. I felt my wetness begin to flood his mouth. He licked and stroked my pussy slowly. I could feel his breath on me as he sucked on my clit. I was getting close and he could feel it. He sucked it hard, then slid a finger deep inside me. Just at the point of his fingering I could feel my body begin to shake and he could tell my climax was close.</p> <p>"My turn," I gasped.</p> <p>As he pulled me up off the bed he kissed me and rolled me so I was lying face up against the head board and as my legs parted he entered me. I was in heaven again.</p> <p>His cock was like something out of a book! It was so long, it felt so big, even though it was going in only a couple of inches at its length. I could feel it pressing against my cervix. It felt so good I started to get wild. He must have known it as he started to pick up pace fucking me hard and fast. I could tell he was losing himself but his thrusting pace did not lessen. I could feel it as if his body was trying to get as much as it could deep within me. It became too tight as he held me still but managed to force his cock deeper than he had earlier before.</p> <p>As I was nearing my climax he pulled me upright and I moved him back until the head of his cock hit my bum. I sat back on top of him, our bodies just touching. I felt him slowly enter me as I lifted my legs up and reached down with my hands and he entered so deep his balls were on my bum. I could feel his cock pulse as I felt him hitting hard against my bum. I closed my eyes tight and felt him as he began to fuck me harder.</p> <p>"God yes you're so hot, I love you."</p> <p>"I know I am; your cock feels so good, it just feels so good inside me."</p> <p>My words were too short to makeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
