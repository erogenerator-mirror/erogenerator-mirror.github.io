You shouldn’t have sex with her. It’s wrong. I was talking to your aunt’s husband.” His voice sounded very convincing.</p> <p>“Ahhh…yes. You can still call my aunt. I’m sorry I haven’t."</p> <p>“I’ve done it with my friends. It’s ok. She’s your aunt. I’m flattered."</p> <p>He was beginning to relax.
