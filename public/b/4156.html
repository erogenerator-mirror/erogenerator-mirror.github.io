"I'd still love to fuck your mommy, Mom....if I'd known you were your sister," he chuckled, looking me in the face. "But... I'm gonna fuck your sister."</p> <p>"She'll never tell," I said with a look of disgust, "she doesn't even give me her address."</p> <p>"Yeahhh," someone said, getting a kick out of our little game, "she'd think I was my sister fucking her brother in the ass after your mommy came barging in on us."</p> <p>I looked over at the door, not quite believing that what was supposed to happen had actually happened. I wasn't sure if I wanted me to call the shots anymore. "You are my sister, you're my girlfriend, and you belong to me, Mommy. So fuck it," I said and then turned and started backing out of the house.</p> <p>"And if you don't fucking leave us alone, well," I said, closing the door behind me, "if we end up fucking on our wedding day...."</p> <p>I was quiet on the way to my parent's house, thinking back to some last night with the two of them. I guess the two of them had a lot in common and that it was apparent that they were really into each other. The girl I was dating was a senior in High School when I met her and they got married shortly after graduation. The two had been best buddies since middle school and it was at that point that I realized that both of them probably had at least one thing in common. They had gotten married within the first two years that I was married and that's when I found out that they were in love with each other. It shocked me a little. I thought that maybe that was just a phase of me but it seems that I was wrong.</p> <p>One thing I couldn't deny, they were in love with each other and there was nothing in hell that you shouldn't be fucking your friend's daughter. The two of them had been married over two years and before that, they used to have a good time. When I first met Mom and she and I dated over a year that spring, we were together, and I guess both of us wanted to know every bit of sex that we had with each other. I was pretty horny and I hadn't had sex in about a week when I realized that I wasn't the only one there who was horny. Both of the girls that the two of us were fucking weren't even home when I got home. They weren't even the mother and daughter that we had been talking with in my room when they went to bed. I guess I never was able to tell them that I was gay and that mommy fucked my brother and they liked that.</p> <p>That made me realize that they also liked that, especially the idea of the two of them having a hot time together. I remembered that the two of them had really fucked, and even more so had I seen my father with a girl in a closet, and what I'd seen was what I'd heard my mother and dad say as they went inside my room. They both were in love with each other. I knew I was just in search of a way to make that happen, but damn... it was going to happen. It was going to be the beginning of a summer break for them.</p> <p>By the time that my parents were already getting off work that evening, I was ready to leave. I was going to take my time getting to school, to think about them and what they were doing right now. I had even made myself a coffee in my room before they got home, wondering about all the dirty thoughts I couldn't control. I knew that no matter what I did, I would always go back to seeing them, and that's why I was going to make sure they didn't have any unwanted thoughts. I knew that if I could do that, I could make it up to them. I was going to seduce them and fuck them to death. I could go through life doing that, but it just wouldn't be that easy. I needed to make the best of things.</p> <p>"Hi, Dad," I said when my folks got home, going into my room before they were even downstairs. "How's your sister?" I asked nervously. Mom seemed more than a little upset, like she was going to lose a fight with him.</p> <p>"She's ok," my father replied, smiling, "she doesn't need me to tell her to let her off the hook," and he took a drink of his coffee and grinned. He shook his head and grinned again at me, "not that she's not sweet, but she can't really do what she just could," he said, grinning too, "she's too embarrassed, I meanâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
