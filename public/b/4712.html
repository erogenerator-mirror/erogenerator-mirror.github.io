The moment was so long ago now, and she could sense it all. She was still naked. She had been naked all night. She didn't have anything to wear for fear of being seen by those that wanted her. All she had was a night's clothes in a little bag.</p> <p>"I know I can't..." she stammered, "and I can't walk out now if you want me...and I'm scared"</p> <p>"Are you really that scared?" he asked. His voice was filled with a warm gentleness. He wanted this conversation to happen again, he knew the answer to that. "You're not so stupid anymore and I'm going to take you into my arms, I promise you. I didn't bring any more of my clothes with me. They'll be mine soon. Come to think of it, the thought of getting dressed is exciting. But you still have to do me a favor. Take off your night shirt and underwear and sit in my lap." His tone was a tease as he told her this. A teasing tease. He pulled her head into his chest and brushed her hair away from her ear.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful, you know that?" She felt herself nodding, and knew that he knew that too. She could feel him smile as she did, and he moved his hand around to her breasts, her nipples hard against his palm. She shivered and leaned her head back into his shoulder. He gently squeezed the bare flesh, and it sent shivers though her body. She turned her face so that she could kiss him, and she did. Her fingers wrapped themselves in his hair, so that he was so close to her mouth, that he could feel it, but not touch. His fingers slipped down her chest and brushed against her breasts, where they were still hidden behind her night shirt. "We're going to the beach after dinner, and I know you'll want to play in the water, it's not so bad after all..."</p> <p>He pushed her backward so that she was lying down, then he lifted her night shirt and sat down on the edge of the pool. His hand began exploring the small of her back, and he gently brushed his fingers against her skin. He traced them over her ribcage, back and forth, then lower. His hand reached the top of the curve between her buttocks, and he gently spread the cheeks even further. He leaned over her, breathing in the scent of her hair. She could feel his breath against her face, and it sent shivers throughout her body, knowing that it hadn't been very long since his last time.</p> <p>"Are you nervous? I've never done anything a bad..." His voice was husky, and his warm breath tickled her ear when he spoke of her, "I'll never hurt you." It was a threat, and it made her cringe from the thought of what he might do to her. She didn't really know what he was talking about. She didn't want him to do anything to her either. They weren't dating yet. He was just teasing. A girl could tell that they had only ever been on a few dates, and they'd already been through so much already. She wasn't sure if she was supposed to be nervous or upset. She was sure that he was the only one she had ever seen naked. She couldn't bring herself to be shy, and she didn't want to be seen as anything more than a woman, so the thought never crossed her mind. "I've never done a thing wrong and never will, and I'll never go too far without talking to you about anything." She breathed her last words, and he kissed her lightly. "We don't do anything. I just want all of the details... and if you don't tell me anything I'll just keep on worrying about it." He didn't bother to remove his hand. He was so much too busy for it to come anywhere near her.</p> <p>"Do you feel any pain? No?" He asked, and she shook her head. "Good" he replied, his breath tickling her ear again. She could feel his finger tracing her skin, moving around the crease where her leg met her belly. He traced a trail around her hip bone, and she shivered. It hurt to move without having to wear panties, but the thought of it didn't bother her, it only made her wet. He was teasing her, and the fact that she didn't actually have any underwear made her even wetter. She shivered, and he looked up at her. He saw her staring blankly at him, and he reached out to her shoulders. He took hold of her hair tightly and she could feel the pressure of his fingers as he pulled the strands away and kissed her. He took her face in his hands, pulled her close to him, and kissed her hard, takingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
