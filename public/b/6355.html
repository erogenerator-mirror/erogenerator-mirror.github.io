"Oh, my God."</p> <p>He smiled. "It's OK, Kitten." He gave her a slow, gentle squeeze, then leaned over to kiss her neck. "Take off that sweater." When he whispered it again, she felt her cheeks turn a deep shade of red. But she ignored it, simply removed it.</p> <p>"Now take off that skirt." And she did. It wasn't the skirt anymore, but a long dark blue camisole. As it went down her legs she felt it tickle as it came away from her body. She stepped out of it and slid it over her head.</p> <p>He reached around her to unfasten her bra and she stepped out of it. As he did her, he slid his hands up under her taut breasts and pulled her to him. She had one arm over his shoulder and the other in a loop on his lap, so he bent their bodies so one would be on the floor. But when he raised himself off the carpet he sat on it and slid her thigh between his legs.</p> <p>"Do that again." He said it as though he were directing her. And she obeyed. "That way it will be easier."</p> <p>"Mmm-hmm, it's been a long time." She felt herself getting wet. She wanted to touch her own sex, but she knew that would not.</p> <p>"Do you know what to do to make yourself cum?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"And does that make it easier for you?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Show me, Kitten."</p> <p>She glanced down at her breasts, where they were almost out of reach from him, and then did. She opened her eyes and licked her lips.</p> <p>"Now, you have to do it for me."</p> <p>"Yes." Now it was her turn to be surprised, but not so much that she stopped.</p> <p>"That is. . ." He smiled up at her, and she found her eyes flutter with each word. "That is." And he reached for her hand. "Hold my hand, if you want. Hold it."</p> <p>She had to look down at herself. How did he know so much more than she did? Her body, from her breasts down, was not designed for the touch of a man. But she let his hand close on her, her fingers curling around it, and then they drew back a breath. She wasn't sure of what was in her heart, but it was there, like the wind, as though they were moving in slow motion through her. But at other times, like when she had wanted to touch herself, or when he had wanted to do that, she had found that she could not stop it. It had grown out of her. And she could only think of what it meant.</p> <p>The realization did not come to her in words, instead in a small sound, but the way he had said it.</p> <p>"I love you Kitten, I love you. I never wanted you to give me any reason to be sad. And now, I can have you to myself, and for the first time I feel free."</p> <p>All she could hear in that moment was a heavy sound, coming from him, a heavy sound with no words, just an occasional inhalation. He pulled her close before saying, "Now I can share you. And I will share you and I will share you and I will." He kissed her, and she could taste his lips on her, the slight taste of an aftertaste that she had longed for ever. And she was still dizzied with him, but for now she kept his lips close to her, enjoying the moment.</p> <p>"I love you, too, Kitten."</p> <p>"I don't care."</p> <p>"So will I," he said with a light laugh. He kissed her again.</p> <p>"Can I stay here long?" She thought her heart might burst. She hadn't told them the word and she wasn't sure she wanted to. But a man was always a man who could ask of a woman. It was a question that was never really answered on the outside, but on the inside she couldn't think what she wanted, what she needed. And she couldn't think of a man she wouldn't love enough to share everything with her.</p> <p>"Of course, Kitten," he said. And she heard him chuckle just a little then. "I'm just asking to be alone."</p> <p>"Oh my God," she thought. "Why?"</p> <p>"I have this thing about being alone sometimes. It's hard going when you have everything else around you..."</p> <p>"What's that supposedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
