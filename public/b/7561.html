He worked his way back up to my stomach while he rubbed the lotion into my legs. I felt the tension in my body subside a little but not until his hands came up and touched my cock. I've always been hard, but this was the first real penis I had ever experienced in my life. He was already hard as he began his exploration. The warmth of his skin and his hot breath on my sensitive member was sending my skin up into my stomach, which had returned to normal size. I must say it wasn't painful at all, his hands felt so good on me. When he touched my scrotum they felt as if his hands could feel them.</p> <p>"Ohhh, your balls." He said as he moved his hand down between my legs. My dick stood at nearly attention. He took her balls in his hands in one hand and massaged the skin with the other. This man knew how to touch a man. I could feel him getting harder under his fingers and knew he was almost to that point. He ran his fingers up to the tip, then back down over the shaft, stopping at the tip again. I didn't know what to do, I just wanted to move my hips and fuck this man. He was not to be denied, he took me from behind.</p> <p>His warm, hard body took over my body, as he spread me open with his hands and positioned me for entry. The man had made his fantasy come true right away. He worked his way up my body, pausing at the base of my cock, to make a point that I could feel his fingers on the outside of my cock. He pulled him close enough that I could feel the heat from his body. A slight vibration of his breath as his lips passed over the head of my penis. I almost came, he was so hard and so damn hot. His hands were warm on my stomach, he stroked my skin with a slight pressure that I know is called a "cup tooth.</p> <p>"We can't, we have to stop," I pleaded. I was begging, I wanted him to do whatever he wanted now. I didn't ever want any other man to touch me like this. He was not to be stopped however. His mouth closed over the mushroom head of my cock and he began to suck again. This sensation was unlike anything I had experienced. He went up and down like a man possessed, my cock was alive in his mouth. The sensation was unlike anything I have felt. He pulled off to the side, still on top of me, and sat his weight back a little on my stomach. He then moved his body up on mine. I could feel his cock rubbing on the top of my stomach and the underside of his. I tried to move my body a little to let him to move over my body. But he was the one trying to get into my ass. He laid down on top of me, I could feel his cock between my thighs and between that thigh and ass. I wanted him to fill me with that cock, to fuck me. But he stopped again.</p> <p>"No, no, no, not yet" I begged "I'm sorry, it's only a couple of minutes." I could feel his cock sliding up and down, almost covering my legs with his body.</p> <p>"Don't worry, I'll make this up to you." He said as he pulled himself up on his elbows. He then bent over to get into position. His mouth opened and he took me in completely. He sucked hard and deep. He took as much of me in as he could with each thrust. I could feel a soft but powerful friction as he entered me and drew me out. His mouth never left my prick, and his hips rocked back and forth, pressing a little further into me with each downward push.</p> <p>"Ohhh, my turn, I need you to finish me," I begged him.</p> <p>"Are you sure my pretty?" I nodded, hoping he would go further. He leaned down a little more, his tongue ran over the head once more, that same slow torture once more. This was nothing like what I had imagined when I had fantasied about it but nothing compared to what that felt like.</p> <p>"Do it, that's it." I said, trying to pull him up. He lifted his hips again. His eyes said, "Don't stop."</p> <p>I did, I moved my hips faster. My hands cupped his ass and moved him in that position, with the same slow rocking he had used to hold off. There was a soft, steady pace that I didn't believe possibleâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
