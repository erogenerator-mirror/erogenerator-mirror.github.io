Not to mention how smart you are."</p> <p>"No," she lied. "I think it's cute. I like watching other guys walk by."</p> <p>"I've noticed." He said. She could feel his body heat as he was close to her.</p> <p>"It's just that I know for certain," she began a short-lived rant. "The man who tried to pull me off of you last night is in the neighborhood right now."</p> <p>"You're going to kill him?"</p> <p>"You know he's just another guy that tried to force me down on you," she snapped back.</p> <p>"He does have a point. I don't have to tell you that."</p> <p>"So where have you been all day this week?"</p> <p>"I was getting a little work done at my favorite watering hole. I didn't know that I was going to have to go back to work today," he said with a big smile. He was so handsome, she couldn't think of a more desirable man to spend the rest of the day with. "Do you want to go swimming?" he asked, smiling.</p> <p>"You're serious?" she asked.</p> <p>"Of course," he said and put his arm over her shoulders. He wanted to push her back into the water and she was so strong, but she was his and he was on his own and he needed to let go of the situation.</p> <p>"Okay, I'll go skinny-dip," she whispered and then they were both laughing as they swam laps. She watched him as his tan, muscular body made the water glisten and splitter. She was actually a little surprised at what a nice-looking body he had. She had thought it was really skinny, but if her mind was correct, she could say that it was more like a dancer's body. She couldn't believe how tall and muscular his body was even with the body of a normal man. The only thing that came to her mind to think about was how big his cock was. She knew she couldn't believe it himself, but she wondered if this guy really knew how to control women.</p> <p>He didn't really see it that way. His body was just a little chubby but it looked and felt like it belonged in her hand. She knew that a fat guy could have an average body, but he did attract very attractive women. She wondered about the other guy's cock. It was so huge and so young. It would be a big deal, she thought. The fact that it was skinny seemed to bother him and she wasn't going to push his luck.</p> <p>"I'm not very good at swimming," she said. "Maybe we can try out each other."</p> <p>"I'd be happy to," he said. "You just look sexy on your own. I guess you'll need to be able to keep your legs closed without them making it all up."</p> <p>"I'm not complaining," she answered. "I'm just not sure about my legs."</p> <p>"I don't mind if they're wrapped around you," he said and laughed.</p> <p>"You're not making it okay that I'm standing here staring at you," he said and squeezed her arm. "Besides, you don't mind being naked in the middle of the water, do you?"</p> <p>"If I go skinny-dipping again, it'll be awkward to swim in the cool water," she retorted. "Besides, I'm almost done." She took a deep breath. "And I don't want to talk about my legs from now on," she said and pushed him away.</p> <p>"You're so sexy," he said and smiled at her. They were both quiet for about ten minutes, enjoying the water and swimming. She could sense him looking at her and that made it better. He had changed into swimming shorts after they got out of the pool. She could feel his body heat. "I'm going to go back to the hotel and check out, and then call the hotel," she said. "If you're okay with that, I'll call to make sure and I'll be up in a couple of hours."</p> <p>"No don't," he replied. "I'm not a swimmer. I'm an amateur at that."</p> <p>"Well, I guess you're wrong," she said, then they laughed a little more.</p> <p>"Well. If you go skinny-dipping again, I won't be long," he said. "I'll let you look for a while. I'm really tired."</p> <p>"You can wait."</p> <p>"Okay," he said andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
