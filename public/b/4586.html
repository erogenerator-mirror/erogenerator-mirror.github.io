I looked down on my naked body and could barely make out my breasts, although I could see my nipples and bush clearly, and that it was a little damp, I couldn't understand why or how her orgasm hadn't subsided.</p> <p>She reached down and took one of my hands with hers, and guided it to her pussy. "You're so wet. It's all mine today. Feel that?" My own pussy, wet from her orgasm, seemed to have an electric charge now. She pulled my hand back until I had to put it down and, still holding it, used it to bring me to attention again. I ran my hand along her slit back to her clit at the same time.</p> <p>"Is this what you want, my little slut? Because it definitely is," she continued to caress me while I pleasured her. A finger gently circled my nipple and I groaned, I needed to come quickly. She looked into my eyes, biting her lip in anticipation, and stroked me back to my own little orgasm. "You are ready for more just now, aren't you?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes," I replied, trying to concentrate on her finger, but she pulled it away. "I want to come again tonight." She bent down once again and sucked my nipple into her mouth, then began kissing her way down my belly to taste herself. My clit was still hard and she rubbed her face with it between her fingers just as I was approaching another climax. "Keep going and let my slut come all over you," she said. "Tell me when you're getting close, so I know you can handle it."</p> <p>"I'm nearly there now," I told her. Her hand left my breast and slid over my stomach, back up toward my pussy and down between my legs. I felt her finger slide up the cleft, but she was avoiding my clit again. "I'm almost there too. How does that feel?" I moaned.</p> <p>"It's so good," she muttered. "Your tongue is so good." I moaned as she started to slide her finger inside me and then began probing it slowly in and out just as I was starting to feel myself approaching my orgasm. My eyes rolled back in my head as that finger slid into me and it felt incredible. This time it didn't stop there. I felt pressure and it pulled me into orgasm, and all else I could imagine was a big smile around the lips that weren't sealed tightly into a kiss.</p> <p>There wasn't a moment of time left in my life when I started coming again. This time, the orgasm was almost there and, when it did, I didn't think I'd ever come that much. "Oh-h... yes... yes..." This time I was the one being in her mouth. And when she swallowed, I went insane. "Yessss! Oh... god-n, yessssss!" My pussy was squirting all over her hand and I swear I was dripping onto the bench seat. Her finger was thrusting into me and every time I bucked against it she came closer to the edge, and when she did bring her hand out from between my legs I felt her cum on it too. We stayed like that for a minute as I felt my body get used to my orgasmic after shocks.</p> <p>Finally we managed to get our breath back and I looked down at her, lying next to me, smiling. I hadn't realized I was still as hard as I was. "Why did you put your fingers in me?" she asked.</p> <p>I smiled and thought how I felt about the little game we'd been playing. "That's what we needed to have a little game where you could do whatever you wanted to me and make me do the same thing you were doing with the stranger you had in your mouth while sucking the stranger's cock. Isn't that the whole point?" she smiled back at me, but didn't respond. She got up to sit next to me, and we looked at each other for a minute. Then she said, "That was beautiful, you know. And I'll just have to do this again and again. Do you know how this game works?"</p> <p>We walked to the bed and lay down, both of us getting tired but totally satisfied. "Now, isn't that a nice way to put it?" I asked.</p> <p>"That was good!" she said, running her nails along my chest.</p> <p>"That's the way I like it when you and I have sex. You can have me anytime."</p> <p>"This time though, though it's different, isn't it?" she said. I looked at her, lying there, with a smile onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
