I could not but smile at him. He stood and came over to pick up his gear. He walked over and picked up the duffle bag and carried it into the van. "It would be nice if I could join you for awhile," He said as he handed it to me. He didn't actually say anything, and I was glad he did.</p> <p>He walked me back to my house and I pulled into the garage and was soon on my way back home. I could see that my car had a small scratch mark on the side and it looked so cute! It was just like the last time I was driving. I was glad I did not have work that day!</p> <p>I walked into my house, showered, cleaned up and packed my gear into the van. I found my way to my parent's house without incident and the kids left about five minutes after I unloaded my stuff. I didn't see Brian at his parent's house at least, I assumed he was taking the kids from their uncle.</p> <p>I started to think about what to wear when I got to my house. I put on a short black skirt, black hose and a black blouse. It was a short dress but with a little jacket on underneath. It was very short but really showed off my figure. It was about mid calf so the skirt was very short and showed plenty of leg. My heels were not very high so it gave me at least eight inches of height. I put on my high heeled knee high boots. I knew that I looked good; I couldn't help it. I put on sunglasses and a coat for modesty sake. I felt so silly wearing the skirt and heels.</p> <p>I took my time cleaning up the house and looking at the clock. I went into my garage and pulled the van out of the driveway. I put my things in my truck and drove away towards the mall. There were a few different stores on offer so I had no trouble finding a parking space. I parked the van and took the few steps to my house. I got out and walked across my yard. I pulled out my truck and walked into the house. I got to the bottom step and I stepped off into the garage, I looked in the living room mirror and saw that my lipstick was bright red and my eyes were nearly matching my outfit. I got out and went to the bathroom, I looked in the mirror and saw how bad I looked. I don't know why but if I had some makeup on with it would look so much better. I looked in the toilet as I ran a finger through my hair. It looked just like my outfit. My nails were dark red and when I put my hair up I was sure I had made more red than red!</p> <p>I stepped to the sink and turned it on; the water was warm and relaxing. I felt so sexy. I opened my mirror and saw that all the lipstick on my face was smeared a little. I walked around the corner and watched the other mirror, I would notice a tiny smear on my lips. I picked up my purse and made my way across my yard. It looked so much better when it was on the other side of the house. The house was warm so I decided to sit by the window so that I could look out. I opened the door and sat down next to my pool. I was not happy that Brian wasn't in the house so I sat there topless sunbathing for three hours. I did not go in there, I did not go into the yard, I did nothing!</p> <p>By then it was almost nine o'clock and my parents needed to be at work for the day. I had to go upstairs because I had to go to my father's house to make dinner. We had to get the kids out of the house because my mother had to go to bed early for work. My father had to go to work. Brian knew this time of year and I figured since Brian was not going to be home until later I wanted to take a short nap. I didn't want to wake Brian so I went downstairs. I went into the kitchen and made a pot of water and sat down in the breakfast nook. I turned on the radio. Brian must have liked it so I put it on. I turned the television on, flipping through the channels. I wasn't paying much attention to what I was watching. I had to admit the channels were good.</p> <p>I was beginning to get very excited. I had to try, right? I turned the channel and saw that one was a horror movie. I put a sock on my ear and listened in. They were old movies that had to be cast in, those scenes were not very erotic. I had to find a way to bring up a sex toy to watch in them. I turned the TV off and sat there in silence while I waited for time to pass. I was so worked up thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
