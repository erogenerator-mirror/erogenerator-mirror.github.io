I felt good. In the conversation, they went on and on about the latest news.</p> <p>"He's got a new job," Jason commented, "and he's got an apartment. He'll probably be out all day just hanging out with some other people."</p> <p>"Can't even imagine what those people will look like in the bar," Amy pointed out.</p> <p>"That'd be me!" I replied.</p> <p>"I'm still in town for a few weeks. I don't know why it's that job that I can't go back into town to see Jason."</p> <p>"I know I can't really tell Jason how I feel, Amy, but there's the whole 'I'm going back to see Jason' thing. I just thought you'd be better off knowing that it's really him," I reasoned.</p> <p>"That's exactly what Jason said too, right, you're getting involved with a new guy from another bar," Amy stated firmly.</p> <p>"What's going to happen to him and the new guy is what he needs," I assured them.</p> <p>Amy seemed to take that news in a different way. "I don't know if its something to do with the bar scene," she said doubtfully.</p> <p>"Well, I don't think it's anything to do with that," I said hopefully, "he's got a new job; and he'd better start doing well with us in the bar."</p> <p>"There's gotta be other things," Amy stated as she looked over at me.</p> <p>"Like how to get him to quit wearing that uniform and what are the odds you could see him as a man?" I asked hopefully.</p> <p>"Why not? It's not like he's not attractive," Amy replied, then looked around at her surroundings.</p> <p>This was a lot different from the way they had been acting. Maybe it was just a big change, because they now seemed happy.</p> <p>"I think he'll need to be there in a little while," Amy pointed out.</p> <p>"I know it has to have an impact on him, but he has something important that we need to be aware of, don't you think?" I asked her.</p> <p>I could sense she wanted to hear the advice.</p> <p>"He's going to be on the team," she said with some conviction, "he just needs to get there faster. Then he'll start to see the real world. That's it."</p> <p>"What's the plan with the guy who is starting to work there?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Yeah, he said some guys are going to play him there. And he also told me he's going to be a special guy for himself. A lot of guys are going to be playing in front of a guy's apartment that he doesn't know," Amy concluded.</p> <p>"Do you think it'll be enough for them to tell they're a man working there?" I asked her.</p> <p>"They'll be the one who won't show up there to watch the whole action in front of a crowd," Amy said seriously.</p> <p>"There's a lot you don't know about guys in the bar, Amy," I offered.</p> <p>"If they're going to be the ones to tell you about it, then they'll have to be," she assured me, but then I asked, "do you think they'll go through with it?"</p> <p>No way was I going to lie to my wife like that, I thought to myself. Maybe I should, but it would only make things more tense. That decision was made to avoid any unnecessary or awkward questions.</p> <p>"I guess so. I guess we'll see. But it's gonna be hard to tell if they'll be a little more selective," I conceded.</p> <p>"Let me know, honey. That's all I can do for now. I just want you to know how you're taking it," Amy said.</p> <p>"Thanks," I said and gave her a quick kiss. I headed off to the bar and sat myself down near the bar again.</p> <p>"So, how do I feel?" Amy questioned me.</p> <p>"It's more than just doing a quick dance," I explained, "I'm hoping to change up the dynamics of it. You were just the center of attention here."</p> <p>"Can we start having a more... intimate connection?" Amy offered.</p> <p>"Sure, sure!" I agreed.</p> <p>"Okay! It's too bad he had to go home after we talked a bit about it," Amy countered.</p> <p>"It's okay," I assured her, "I was just worried about the guy, you know?"</p> <p>"Yeah, you're right," she assured me, "I guess I was hoping we could just have a little more time together before it's tooâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
