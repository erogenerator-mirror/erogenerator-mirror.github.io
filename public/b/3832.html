I wanted to hear what you thought about it all. Finally we arrived just as the end of day approached and my mind was on the excitement for you. We made our way into the lobby before he could speak. My heart racing, excitement all at once. Your smile sent shivers down my spine. You turned towards me, your gaze fixed on my eyes, and smiled.</p> <p>He looked away, and just looked at you, waiting. You came towards him and leaned up towards him. The smile that lit your face was even better now. You kissed him on the cheek. He just shook his head and smiled warmly with his eyes closed. You pulled away, taking a seat.</p> <p>He just sat there, trying to get his breath back, when you looked at him, and said, "You're right, I'm glad you're here, I want us to be friends, and there's nothing wrong with that. Besides, I haven't been here in a while and I want to spend a few days with you tonight."</p> <p>He paused, then grinned and said, "Of course, I like you very much." With that you raised your leg to rest it on his thigh. You leaned in so your mouth was just above his ear. You said, "I'll see you in a few minutes." With that you stood up, looked over your shoulders at the bar, and walked out to your car. Your heels left no question as to what sort of date you'd be having tonight.</p> <p>He sat there in a daze, unable to put up a real fight. "What the hell," he thought. He got in his car, walked out, and drove off to his place.</p> <p>You turned to me with a smile. "Thank you for coming in, it was nice meeting you, and thank you for meeting me too. Don't think you need to be nice, you deserve at least some good things." With that you grabbed my hand and led me into his apartment. We walked to his door.</p> <p>"Wow..." was all I could say.</p> <p>"Wow! Really?"</p> <p>"Oh, wow... yes!"</p> <p>"Thank you." You opened the door and we walked in, you closed it off, and led us to his living room.</p> <p>He pulled me towards him, and kissed me deeply. You pulled back a little, smiled, and said, "Let's get comfortable." You pulled me into his arms, and sat me gently down in a chair in front of his couch. You sat the chair next to him, and said, "I've been waiting all week for this. I have had a hard day, and I want to be nice and relaxed for you."</p> <p>"It's been stressful." I replied. "Why don't we do something about it?"</p> <p>"I can't really think why. I think I'm just nervous."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"I want this, and I want to take things slow. I've always been very shy, and I thought it would be nice to have a friend like that now."</p> <p>"You're my friend, I care about that."</p> <p>"Maybe I should change that, I mean I just thought you were special to me. You've always been very polite and warm."</p> <p>"Well, that counts for something, since everyone in this town is either the same age as you or, like I said, your roommate?" He seemed a little uneasy again.</p> <p>"No... I know about that too. I was just wondering how I could help you, and also my roommate."</p> <p>"I'm not sure I should be asking this. You have always been nice."</p> <p>"I know." Your arms encircled my waist and I leaned into you, my lips brushing against yours, with my hands caressing your cheeks. I was becoming hot and bothered by the way you were reacting to my words. I slowly backed away and then looked into your eyes. "Look, I don't think I can say anything else, but would you... would you promise to call me tomorrow and let me know?"</p> <p>You kissed my lips, which were still damp with moisture, and replied, "As long as you're my friend, I promiseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
