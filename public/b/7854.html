I took a fistful of hair in one hand, and pulled her head back by the long hair, and said, "Are we going to fuck or what?" She responded, "Whatever you say... please."</p> <p>I then put my lips to hers, and kissed her as we both fell on the bed onto each other. I moved her towards me, grabbed her buttocks in each hand, and pulled her towards me. She spread her legs apart. I pushed my cock into her wet opening, and began to fuck her as I held onto her thighs. She began to move back and forth a little as I pumped into her. I felt my orgasm start then, and I pulled back, almost pulling out of her, but I would not move. She was very wet and ready for me, and I would not resist her, or her body. I fucked her harder and faster while we kissed, sucking her nipples which sent her over. She was still moving her pussy slowly up and down. I held her clit between my thumb and forefinger as I continued to fuck her. I was getting close, as she had said earlier. I pulled my cock out of her, and told her to get on her back. She got up slowly, and I lay down next to her, and she moved her body to spoon to me. We kissed at first, as her hand cupped my cock, and her warm body molded to mine. We caressed each other's bodies, and we were quiet.</p> <p>After a long while of holding each other and kissing I put my arm about her, pulling her onto me. We hugged each other close on our sides. She reached between her legs from this position, and began to rub my cock on her pussy lips. I reached forward and put my hand on her breast, and put my hand over hers. I gently squeezed her nipple as I kissed her. After a long time we moved our bodies together, making it even more erotic. I held her head back slightly and she sucked just the tip of my cock, while my hand still cupped her breast. After several minutes I had to turn her face to me, as I took my lips from her face, and softly kissed each of her eyelids.</p> <p>I rolled onto my back, with her lying on top of me. I pulled her up on top of me. Our legs came together and spread between them apart. Our breathing became deep and ragged as we kissed one another. "You have made me a very, very, very, horny woman" was the only word I spoke. We made love in the shower. I washed her, and then washed her hair. We got dressed, and as you understand, we talked about what had just happened a few days ago. All I could say is, "I want to make love to you every night and every place you will want it. And, I think I'm going to spend another night with you. Don't you?" I kissed her, and said I wanted her all to myself, and "Goodnight, sweetheart."</p> <p>It was after midnight when I picked her up and she went to her car. We kissed many more times before her friend drove her to her hotel. And, the next night as we were eating dinner, I looked at her a little longer. She had a beautiful smile on her face. I leaned over and kissed her lips, whispering in her ear the number of nights that I loved her so very, very much.</p> <p>I told her how much of a joy she was making me feel. She just smiled. We went upstairs together and I showered. She followed me to the bed a couple of times, then I held her from behind. I lifted her dress over her head. I kissed her neck and her shoulders. I let her dress fall down her body as she took off her shoes, which had gone into a small hamper.</p> <p>I took off my shirt and shorts. Her eyes widened as she noticed my erection as we lay side by side. Then she started sucking on my cock. She took it out, and ran her hands all over my body. She sucked my testicles into her mouth, and took them into her mouth and out again. I could feel her tongue all around my shaft. Her hand moved up and down as her tongue licked and caressed it. I could not believe my own pleasure when she took it into her mouth. She moved up and down as her breasts brushed against me. She stopped to kiss me and then turned around to kiss her lips. She rubbed her body against mine, then slid my cock inside her. Our mouths explored each other's mouths while my hands caressed her body, feeling the smoothness of her skin. She moved up and down faster, as I moved my fingers into her cunt. She put her hand down and put both of her hands on my chest, as Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
