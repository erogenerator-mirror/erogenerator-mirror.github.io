I don't know this country. If you don't have your clothes down by this time next week I'm gonna throw your ass in the desert for sure." I told him.</p> <p>I felt him relax and was pleased with myself for not causing anymore pain. Then with all that had been done to me I was not even half a lover and I was very satisfied with the result. I smiled at him to let him know I meant what I said.</p> <p>It was about a month after we had met when he decided to be gone. I had called up my friend Sam to see if there was anything for her to do around here. I had been told to stay away from Sam. I was happy just to be gone. She just needed a place to move after what I saw her doing to her mother last night.</p> <p>I drove down there to check the place for her mother and it turned out to be a nice little community. Since Sam wasn't a religious woman I told her to give her mother a visit next week. She looked sad as I drove away, but told me to keep away from her mother. I gave her mother's last name and when I had left her mother stood up and said that for my sake and Sam's. She looked at me in despair and without me even caring what she thought. I gave her the same message I gave for my mother. I couldn't say anything as I left her there for the first time not wanting to even think about what it would do to her if her mother came to see Sam at all. She started to cry and I got to my car and followed her to one of the houses in her family.</p> <p>When we got inside she said that Sam was the happiest man on the planet. I was still a bit upset as I started to cry. She was happy for me and happy that I had been looking after her in a way she hadn't. Sam finally smiled and told me that she was glad I had stopped by once to apologize for what I was doing to her mother. I told her that I had done everything I could to do that.</p> <p>Sam had just finished coming up from the kitchen and asked me what I was so worried about. I told her that I was not worried about her father or that she and my father had just split up. Sam was still upset when I told her. She asked me if I had gotten my license and of all things that she asked for she said that I could have it in the mail if I wanted. I told her that there was no problem at all for the license. After that it was my duty to mail it so that she knew what her mother was saying.</p> <p>Sam told me that a friend of hers had asked her if she and her mother could find another room at the cabin for when she was gone for the holiday. I was shocked, scared to death, and then surprised that Sam had asked. I told her that I thought it was the best idea she had ever had. She said that she thought it was the best idea she had ever heard of. I had tears in my eyes when she told me, then when she hugged me to her in front of my parents. My father and mother had come after me the first day and that was just to put me out of my misery. They were like my father and I was like one of them. I got to be a little older and when I was thirteen and before the parents got me, it was my turn to go to the college in town if it wasn't already in the town. I had to drive home and the only one I didn't go to was Sam's sister, who was still married. I didn't really care or have a problem with it because I knew I would die being her friend.</p> <p>We ended up seeing each other and were happy that neither of us was cheating. I was only happy that this wonderful woman cared about me and so far she was also kind to me. We had just graduated last year and I was really looking forward to seeing Sam at least once a month though, that is until her mother came to see me a few days later. We started seeing each other twice a month but she was still seeing the man on the phone. She was actually very good in bed, but I really didn't want her to see me all that time. She was only seeing me when she wanted to and then when her mother was away. She really never said anything to me about that, she just told me to go ahead and see her on her own if it would make a difference to me. That was all the encouragement I got.</p> <p>When Sam and I started seeing each other more often, she told me that it wouldn't be much longer now before she would be seeing her mother. I didn't know what to make of that. Sam even asked me to come for a visit. I was surprised as she had mentioned a woman there that had comeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
