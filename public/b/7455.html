His thrusts got more erratic and faster until he just came inside of her. Her body continued to rub against him. He kept thrusting but it became more intense. Finally, he felt a sense of exhaustion that only came with the pleasure of the experience that was now at an end. Still feeling weak he collapsed onto her. His breathing had returned to normal. She ran her fingernails through his chest hair and then placed a soft kiss on his lips.</p> <p>"I think we should go to bed." she said as she lifted the covers and they both got into bed.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Kerry lay in bed staring up at the ceiling. She didn't know where all the dreams happened but she knew that she liked the ones that her friend Jane told her that she loved. But that was it. She felt as if she had lost her friend. For the first time in her life she felt like she had loved something. She knew the feeling wouldn't last forever, but it was there.</p> <p>Kerry looked up at her friend Jane asking for her opinion.</p> <p>"She's not lying on the couch asleep." Jane said.</p> <p>"Maybe we should give her a break because I am a woman and could never give him another woman to satisfy his urges."</p> <p>Kerry giggled at Jane's idea of a woman.</p> <p>Jane took a swig of water and looked at her friend lying in bed. She didn't look up, but just smiled softly at her.</p> <p>"I think he would have liked that." She said softly.</p> <p>Kerry looked over at her friend who lay there quietly looking at the ceiling. It was time for her to start looking into her feelings and memories of last night. She looked back up at her friend Jane who had just drifted off to sleep. Her head on her friend's chest.</p> <p>"So is he as happy as you are." she asked.</p> <p>Jane nodded as she placed her hand over Kerry's breast. "Maybe."</p> <p>"I don't know about you. But I was happy last night." Kerry said.</p> <p>"Honey, you shouldn't have let that happen. Not even once. If we hadn't been in the club, or if he hadn't been inside of her, I would have wanted you to have said something." Jane said.</p> <p>"Honey, I had every intention of letting you be happy. However I didn't. You have to understand what it meant. I just want to help in the process right there. Do you understand? It's hard not to like him." Kerry said.</p> <p>Kerry nodded and nodded again.</p> <p>"I don't know. I was always afraid you wouldn't want to be an emotional woman. And I never got the courage to do it before." Jane said.</p> <p>Kerry nodded.</p> <p>"Kerry, you don't have to be afraid. It is natural for a man to have urges that he shouldn't have."</p> <p>"Well he will always be there for me. You need to be there for him." Kerry said thinking about how Jane had once told her that she missed him.</p> <p>Kerry leaned over and kissed her and said goodbye to her best friend. She wanted to say goodbye to him, but she didn't. She thought, "How do you figure that?"</p> <p>***</p> <p>Kerry woke earlier than usual and saw the clock on the night stand. 10:30. She got up and made her way to the shower. With water running in the shower door she grabbed her overnight bag and made her way to her room.</p> <p>She went to her dresser and found her toothbrush and toothpaste. She grabbed her toothbuds and opened her door to get ready. She was dressed a little bit before 11. She walked back downstairs and just in time to see a look of concern come over Jane's face.</p> <p>"Good morning, dear." Kerry said as she walked over to her.</p> <p>She smiled at her friend. "Sorry."</p> <p>"You look beautiful this morning." Kerry said.</p> <p>Jane blushed deeply embarrassed. Kerry wrapped her arms around her friend and they hugged.</p> <p>"Sorry about last night. You must have had a lot to drink last night." Jane whispered.</p> <p>"Oh, I had a lot of. But I don't want to upset you" Kerry said.</p> <p>Jane nodded and replied with a smile, "Oh no, no problems. I just want to do all I can for now. I love that man. We should finish getting dressed and get out of here." She said.</p> <p>Kerry walked her to her door. She opened up and they stepped out.
