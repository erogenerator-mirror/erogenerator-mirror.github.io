A little tear had escaped to her eyes. He cupped one of the handfuls of her breasts in the palm while his other hand went to his pocket where he retrieved his phone. He handed it to her.</p> <p>"Here," he said taking her hand and bringing it up towards him to kiss her hand, "and I think we should set up a little something in bed."</p> <p>"Oh god please fuck me," she cried out again.</p> <p></p> <p>THE TRUTH ABOUT THE TRUTH</p> <p>It turned out that the blonde blonde, Lisa, was a good actress. A pretty, butch in looks who'd done a lot of acting. She also was a good dancer.</p> <p>One day, while Lisa was gone, Steve came into the bedroom and said, "You're not leaving, are you?"</p> <p>"Not until we fuck, honey. Get undressed and lie down on the bed."</p> <p>Steve did as he was told. Lisa lay down on her back on the bed. She was wearing a red lace bodysuit. As Steve stood there looking at her she slipped her arms through a string of pearls hanging over her head. He was transfixed by the sight of her breasts. Her nipples were tiny pointed and were standing at attention to the slightest touch of her hands.</p> <p>Lisa said, "Come and put this on and come back to me."</p> <p>Steve was in a state. He had been feeling neglected and now had just had an intense, passionate and erotic experience. His cock was standing at full attention and he couldn't get his head around the implications of what he'd just done.</p> <p>Without being told, he got on his knees between her legs. Lisa had already taken off her panties and was holding out the bottle of oil with her left hand. As Steve squirted a healthy amount of oil into his hands, she started rubbing it lightly on the outside of his cock. It became a bit hard to concentrate for all the sensations coursing through his body. He felt his cock starting to respond to Lisa's touch.</p> <p>He started to caress the inside of her right leg and was a bit puzzled. His hands were already feeling her up. He rubbed her leg and moved upward to her pussy. Steve's eyes were a bit glazed as he kept on coming back to his senses. He was aware of his own body trembling with a passion he rarely felt.</p> <p>Suddenly Lisa pulled Steve's face to where he'd just been. She leaned over on her left elbow and put her right hand on the inside of his right thigh. She started running her fingers between his crotch and leg. She began pulling on his belt which was still open. Steve's breathing also felt as if he were going to explode. As her fingers ran lightly across his balls, Steve found himself feeling a warm sensation of an electrical flow run across his body. His cock was rigid and he had to touch it, it was driving him crazy.</p> <p>Lisa had the oil and she ran a finger from his balls all the way up to the opening of his cock. She stopped just before he reached his orgasm and slowly slipped her fingers around it stopping to place each ball in her mouth, sucking them gently. She was smiling as Steve's fingers had this electricity on the end of it.</p> <p>"Wow!" Steve said as her fingers moved up. "That really makes my cock ache!"</p> <p>"Now that's what I like," she said as she pulled Steve's cock all the way to the end.</p> <p>She moved his cock up and down over her belly and into her pussy. Steve's breathing was ragged as she pumped him up to within an inch or two of her body. Steve began pumping away at Lisa's pussy from a kneeling position.</p> <p>"Oh yes, that feels good," Lisa exclaimed. "So soft. So warm."</p> <p>Steve was starting to really like this position; Lisa's legs were spread wide at him and she was just using the full length of her hand to stroke up and down the length of his cock. Steve was in awe; feeling as though he were standing above her.</p> <p>"This is so good, my cock feels good, don't stop, just keep on going, it feels so good, I think I'm going to cum."</p> <p>Lisa leaned up and with her mouth closed over the head of his penis she could feel Steve's own penis responding. She then let the head slide off her tongue as she started using the same lips and tongue as her best friend. She could feel his whole body beginning to tremble; almost a jolt of electricity was all that had ever coursed along it.
