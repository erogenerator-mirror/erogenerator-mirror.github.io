She came over me to the bar, and sat down while I got my drink. I don’t think I was expecting her to make a move on me, it was one of the things those kids in high school have done.</p> <p>Her voice was deep and hushed, she was a bit like a kid in the back of her father’s car, and yet so sexy to me. She was tall, but very little on the outside, she was a few inches shorter and slender, but had long dark brown hair and dark brown eyes, like her father and mom did when it was just me. She had a big, soft, yet powerful looking mouth, and she wore a nice buttoned-down shirt, black pants and cowboy boots. We ordered and drank our drinks. "Hey there, sweetheart! Long time no see."</p> <p>It occurred to me that I didn’t know her real name, but I’m sure it isn</p> <p>"Uh-huh," she murmured, smiling at me, I could tell that her smile was genuine. As we finished the third and final drink, she stood and offered a toast. "To making friends I want."She stood to her feet. "I’m out of here. I’m going somewhere.</p> <p>"Where are you going?" I asked, trying to sound as sexy as I could as I placed a small bottle of Astroglide on the barstool, hoping she didn</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>As she drove home, I think about the way her legs looked under her jeans, my little girl</p> <p></p> <p>She came to the house on the edge of town, I could see her pulling her car away in the distance. I heard her door open, she walked in the front room, I heard the TV on.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>It was all going to the movie, I had the entire house to myself. What was I going to do? I wasn</p> <p></p> <p>I felt the heat of her body, how her thighs pressed into mine, she had her hand between my legs, rubbing against the fabric against my pussy. I spread my legs, making it easier to slide my fingers into her. That was all I needed. She pulled away from the door of the house and looked back toward the house. I felt her hand move between my legs, and she moved her hand back and forward against my throbbing clit.</p> <p></p> <p>I felt myself starting to slide into the bedsheets, as she moved from side to side across from my body on the bed. We talked about this and that, she told me how much of a good Catholic girl I had been. She never mentioned her religious experience, but did confess to masturbating when she didn</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"Tell me all about it</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I heard her breathing quicken, she didn</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I could feel myself reaching the point of no return, I needed this, I needed to cum—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
