I love the way it's going. You know how to love it. You can make it feel good too, can't you?" I smiled, feeling like a kid again. And as she did everything I said, I was having the time of my life. There wasn't anything wrong with that. In fact, it was a lot better than I originally thought.</p> <p>"But I'm afraid you're going to make a big mistake, Jen. I understand. You're only too happy to enjoy your new life. That's all there is wrong about your life today. I want our new life to be wonderful and complete and if you can wait, then we have everything we'll ever need and more. Do you know what I'm going to say, to you? I'm going to watch and learn and I'm going to love you because you're going to be everything to me today."</p> <p>The smile on my face said it all. For the first time, I really thought about our new life together and the things it might be good to be as I felt. For a moment, we got a little uncomfortable then, but then I saw that she was enjoying herself just as much as me.</p> <p>"I love you, Jen. So fucking much that I can't wait to see what your life will be like as you enjoy what other women like to do to me. Your husband is only too happy to watch and to do whatever you want to do with me."</p> <p>She smiled then and I was shocked for a few seconds. Maybe she really meant what she said. She meant everything to me. I felt like I knew her. "Can I kiss you, babe?" the thought came out more rapidly than I meant it. I could have sworn she smiled. Maybe she really did. I was thinking about her lips on mine for a very long time when she put her hand on me and said, "No."</p> <p>She didn't know.</p> <p>There was my answer then, "If I let you, Jen, do you know what you need, what you need and what you need now?"</p> <p>I could feel her heart beating, the way it would always do when she was excited and excited about something. She was doing this on purpose. Her hand was on me. My hard dick was standing up against my pants, pointing in the air. I didn't know what to say back. I had to give her the time right now. There was another question to ask first; what was Jen about to do that she wanted to do. I was thinking about things I knew she would have said if she wasn't already doing that.</p> <p>"Do I have to ask again?" I was thinking that if I told her something that made her feel good, and that it made her happy, then we'd just have a good time. The thought sent a message to her that I would do what she wanted, and in a short time, our friendship would endâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
