"We'll see, and don't get me wrong, if you want to make it happen, we do it all. You can help and I have no objection. But if you want to, we'll go from there. It won't be an easy decision."</p> <p>I don't know why, but I had a hard time talking. At the end of the meeting, Mr. Cramer escorted me around the room and over to the other side of the conference table. I stood there like a statue.</p> <p>"I have a message that Mr. Cramer, and myself, should be in the area of your office, tonight," Mr. Cramer said. "I will be here, in about twenty minutes." So, as he was handing my phone to me, I left the table and walked back to my hotel room.</p> <p>++++++++++++++++</p> <p>It was late when I walked in the door. When I went to the bed, I found myself thinking about all that I had learned that night and that morning about my future. The whole trip up to my office, from my desk to the room where Mr. Cramer had helped, had really helped me. I had actually enjoyed the sex, and I could still see some parts of him. I had enjoyed it in fact, but in reality, I was confused by my thinking. I did realize that most of the time he didn't care for me sexually, and I did appreciate it, but it had been too long. That was why he had to have come to me at the party, and he had not come for anything more than a quick kiss. That was why he had taken me home and taken me through to my new home. He hadn't come with me.</p> <p>I had already told him about going to see a doctor and a gynecologist, and what he needed to do to correct his mistake. I hadn't told him all that, and I didn't want to spoil his happiness. But now he had to do it. And to be honest, I had never told him much about how I had ended up fucking Mr. Cramer. I had just decided to give him what he needed. It was the best decision I made in all my years.</p> <p>Mr. Cramer came into the bedroom shortly after, without saying a word. He had been wearing a black tuxedo shirt and tie. He was carrying a bag and he made no move to get out of his shoes. He was wearing a pair of blue jeans and some light green cotton socks, and a black shirt. I couldn't tell if he was wearing jeans under his blue shirt but I wasn't about to tell. His feet were bare, except for stockings or heels. I stood there in his bedroom, with my dress shoes on, thinking about what I had to do. I hadn't said much of anything. I thought that it was time to start putting away my doubts. I had already done my research and I thought that I could do it. I had been wrong, but now I didn't even need to ask. I felt my heart race.</p> <p>I walked directly toward the bed and as I climbed on it, I turned to look at the bottom of the bed and could clearly see that Mr. Cramer was laying there on his back, his shoes were on the floor and his hand was grasping a pillow. I was suddenly very happy.</p> <p>"So you are going to be watching me with my legs spread and a wet pussy and looking down at me, aren't you?" Mr. Cramer was smiling. "The way you said it, I thought you would think I had a pussy and a mouth, so I was wrong. That, and you are a man, so it wouldn't surprise me if you had a penis and my pussy was wet. That doesn't mean you are gay, it means you were fucking a woman that first time around," he laughed then as he was laughing. "So you see, this is what you meant when you said that you wanted me to know what was going on with you in between me and the other couple. This is what you are worried about."</p> <p>"I don't know what to do. I just can't do that," I said. "I don't have a condom in the house. Do you know what you have in the bathroom?"</p> <p>"The other couple," he said with a laugh. "Some women don't get it, but I found a good bunch of them. Not really any more than they are, but enough to use. I told one of the women I would watch the other woman and she said that I would know what to do in a minute and so she got me a packet. I know that a lot of women do it and they don't want an accident and do something rashâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
