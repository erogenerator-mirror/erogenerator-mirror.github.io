If he were to die I would need a way to let him go. He is my brother, I don't care what he said he was and what he did to others, but it was wrong to have him here. So I went to kill him, it isn't easy but I have not been able to do that. It was best I left him behind until you were able to help..."</p> <p>"It isn't that he shouldn't have gone. It is just that he has to live. Not for himself and not for the little brother that is yours."</p> <p>"It is best you go... I won't be any help." She said, her eyes still wet from tears.</p> <p>"Okay, okay. I'll be good, maybe when you get home and you leave I will. I would make sure of that, but you don't have the money to move your stuff back here. Besides it will be hard walking when you do."</p> <p>She smiled at me and got out to help me with the boxes. She said,</p> <p>"Oh thank you, you didn't have to... you don't even know what was given to you. There was more than enough of that in there and there really wasn't much of a life for me. Thank you so much."</p> <p>I smiled and pulled her to me, holding on to her and kissing her mouth,</p> <p>"I can help when you get your head and your back on the ground and if you can get on your feet as well."</p> <p>"I would have never thought of doing that with you before, even if he had said he would give me a chance."</p> <p>But I guess there could be a lot with her when she isn't around to appreciate the fact that it wasn't really his fault. She gave out another sigh, but then she looked down at the box.</p> <p>"I've got these things and I need them."</p> <p>"And you can do something about that." I replied, "It's been a long time since I've given my two cents of the situation."</p> <p>I turned her around and gently took her head in my hands and looked in her eyes. She looked back with the same eyes I had in mine the first time she was here.</p> <p>She looked down at the box and said,</p> <p>"What do you mean I should move back? It's not really that hard."</p> <p>"I understand. I've been thinking about this a lot." I said, my hands moving off of her head. "I never thought I could say this to someone but I was thinking about you."</p> <p>She sat up a bit then, almost standing, and looked down at the box.</p> <p>"How can I know, how can I know what I would know, not even what I wouldn't know?... I haven't said that to anyone." Her voice was a little shaky.</p> <p>"Don't worry about it, it's okay." I said. "I have known you a long time. It's very natural for a brother, but one you didn't know how to be around, you aren't even a very good lookin' model, and you are always coming up to me at least once a week."</p> <p>As I told her, I couldn't be sure. You can't be certain one's thoughts, but even though one's parents are right now with what was said the last time, I knew I would never think about you if I didn't, even if you had said no. I was sorry for that, but we wouldn't do that again and we would be able to deal with it. I guess I should go and go find the box.</p> <p>"No, I was going to go there too."</p> <p>"Don't worry, you'll see me in a minute!"</p> <p>I leaned down gently and got my clothes back in place and went out to get my things. I got to my truck after getting dressed and had everything turned back into the truck so that there would not be a need to get out to put things back on and then drive away again if something happened to you. I got in my truck and looked over at the truck as an idea hit me. If you could go back to the house and get some food and maybe a place to stay and try to get some stuff on the way back, that would be nice for now. If not, and that is what I knew. When I got to my house and I saw that I could see you, you looked even more beautiful in the sunlight. I felt a blush hit me, even though I was the one looking.</p> <p>"You better get going." I said, "I'm sorry that I don't know when I can get back to try to find this box."</p> <p>Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
