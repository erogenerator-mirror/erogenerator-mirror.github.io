I looked at the hair I had just painted across her brow, kissed it and went back to her eyes slowly and sensuously, trailing my wet tongue down to her ear, over her earlobe, down her cheek and finally back to the hollow of her throat, over her chin and then down her neck to her collar bone. She shivered slightly as her neck received my wet tongue, and I took my hands from her thighs and slid them up both of her breasts, over her throat and over her nipples. She gasped loudly and pulled me with her as she wrapped her arms tightly around me and squeezed hard as her head rolled back.</p> <p>I was about to make love to her breasts at the same time I kissed her neck, but she let go of me and wrapped her thighs tightly around my waist. When she pulled my body to hers she began to fuck me again, hard, with long strokes and she was moaning and squealing as another orgasm wracked her body. I was too excited, and so was she. We ground into each other's bodies as we climaxed together. My cock spasmed wildly and I felt that I had to thrust it into her, lest we both faint, but she grabbed it and began to stroke it in and out slowly. Her hand never stopped jerking me and I felt it start to become a regular rhythm.</p> <p>We stayed that way for a while, her thigh muscles squeezing my shaft, my cock throbbing in her hand. Then she released my body with one last push and I fell on my back as the tension drained out of me.</p> <p>She collapsed on the floor next to me and I lay next to her with my arms outstretched. She wrapped her arm around me, the back of her hand lightly running down my back to my ass, where she began to gently stroke my leg over and over, her hands lightly tracing the lines of my leg as it rose from under me. And, as our bodies came together to connect again she slowly slid her hand downward until she found my still hard cock. With a smile she slowly licked her lips, smiled, then said, "Do you know, I was planning on tonight doing my best to stay true to my promise. I never would have let you come while I was gone, you know. But, you have to have your own rules too." I thought as I smiled, "How about we all fuck, in a different room?"</p> <p>She raised her eyebrows then grinned again and slid her hand back down my body, her eyes staring at my crotch as she continued, "I've had to make a lot of men cum in front of me. But you know how bad you taste and I've wanted you for a long time?" I shivered a bit as she lightly brushed her lips across the head where she had been stroking me. She slowly kissed it as, almost imperceptibly, she began to massage it with her hand.</p> <p>"What can I say that won't kill you?" I smiled widely, "We may even love each other. After all, our marriage is over. You can be my woman." I kissed her. She gently released me and stood up. "And don't think anything of it while I'm over there. You've earned it. See you around."</p> <p>The moment left with an awkward silence as we looked at each other, and smiled.</p> <p>I got up and headed into the kitchen to get my coffee and take care of the dishes before the kids got back. I was just pouring my coffee when there was a knock at the front door and my son yelled out, "I know you were just going to come in, but I was going to tell you." Our neighbor yelled back, "I know, I'm a little old to have to wait that long." But, he didn't seem mad, and they both smiled when I saw him coming up the stairs. It didn't really take him long to get there, but when he saw the light and followed me inside, he was not alone.</p> <p>He was a sweet boy. I'd never seen him so confident. And of course that was when I first took his virginity.</p> <p>After our little chat, I excused myself and made my way to the bathroom. When I came out, the lights were dim again and I found that the door on the other side was slightly ajar. When I turned around into the bathroom, I gasped in shock. There was a naked woman in the doorway. She was kneeling on the tile floor and had her head buried in the bedside table. I didn't know what to say or how to react in that moment, but I was shocked by what I saw. She was naked, spread eagle on her back, her legs spread wide as an offering to the gods, and her youngâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
