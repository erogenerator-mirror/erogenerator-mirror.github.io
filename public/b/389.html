We will come back in a jiffy if you're nice."</p> <p>"Okay, here take our bags."</p> <p>Sophie and I set our bags on the nightstand. We hugged and whispered "Happy New Year's Eve" around each other's arms, as we slowly made our way upstairs through the house.</p> <p>Chapter Seven</p> <p>Karen was on the bed, naked, looking at herself from her bag as her husband, Mike, and I came into the bedroom. Sophia lay down on the bed, her legs dangling off the edge, her eyes focused on the full length of my wife's body, the redhead lying there in bed. My wife was slowly stroking her clitoris, watching Sophia touch herself.</p> <p>"You looked so pretty, and sexy looking at the end. We both love taking pleasure from you. Is that the way it should be for our pleasure?"</p> <p>"Yes, I just want to feel it. I guess I feel a little guilty about it when things haven't been good."</p> <p>"Doesn't it hurt hurting? I love it when you do that, it gets me very hot just doing that. If you just use another part of your body, like my vagina, my clitoris, I think it will go away. Do try to get some rest."</p> <p>Sophia leaned over and kissed my wife's forehead, then her lips, as I went up on the bed. I kissed my wife deeply and passionately, kissing her face and neck. I took her breasts gently in my hands again, and they were already hard and sensitive, rising and lowering with her gasps. Sophia, too, was on her second orgasm, her back arched, her eyes shut tight as she moaned out loud. My wife reached under me and placed her hand on my own penis, gently stroked me, and then she put both hands around its circumference.</p> <p>"Let me do you!"</p> <p>Sophia slowly sat on the side of the bed, facing me, and I could immediately see the light shining from her nipples, swollen and erect, a little pink now with desire. I gently kissed her nipples then, as I slid down the bed to kiss her navel, and then down to her labia.</p> <p>"Are you ready now?"</p> <p>"Yes. Now," she replied, looking straight into my eyes.</p> <p>"Yes?"</p> <p>"Yes!" she yelled.</p> <p>I slowly moved between her legs and I lowered myself onto her. Sophia held my cock still for a moment, then I rubbed my organ along her vagina, moving away to kiss her lips. We kissed deeply, exploring each other's mouth with our tongues in a passionate, caressing dance. For the next minute or so, I pushed into her, slowly, as my wife took a breast into her mouth, fondling my balls with one hand. She was moving against me, her hips thrusting against me, as I slowly moved towards my orgasm. Our kissing became more passionate as she thrust herself up and into me, my strokes into her became deeper and more urgent.</p> <p>I could feel my orgasm approaching, and Sophia reached across me to turn her head, our lips and lips joined in a passionate kiss of love. We kept going until I came inside her, then pulled my cock out of her, and I was ready to start again. I moved down her body, licking her vagina, her clitoris, and then my tongue, slowly moving along her clitoris, circling the rim of the head, then moving my way inward again. Sophia was so turned on by my attentions, even though she had been close before, her whole body began to shudder as I started to massage her clitoris with my tongue. I moved up her body once again, kissing the tip of her breasts, avoiding the nipples, and then began to lick and kiss the valley between her breasts, moving from one to the other, her nipples hard, achingly erect, as I sucked them into my mouth and sucked, hard. Her body began to convulse with her third orgasm, her head thrown back, her hands grabbing handfuls of the sheet, her body rising and falling, she was screaming in passion and satisfaction. I kept licking her breasts, until her eyes rolled back, then, as her last orgasm subsided, I crawled back up to her and pushed my still hard penis into her vagina, moving myself on top of her. We fucked, I kissed her mouth, eyes closed, her tongue flicking out between her lips, kissing her passionately.</p> <p>We lay there, enjoying the afterglow. Eventually, Sophia lay on her back, her chest risingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
