I could feel my face getting redder and redder in her hands, and she just looked at me in complete surprise. Then, her hands were shaking, as she opened the door for me.</p> <p>My jaw dropped when I saw her. A woman standing there looked much as I've imagined she'd look. And unlike before, she wore very short shorts and a long sleeve shirt, which barely contained her amazing breasts. As I said, they jiggled so well, I wanted to cover her up right there.</p> <p>She didn't seem even half-decent. She was almost all pink and flushed skin, which made her look more like I remember from last time. And there was this little tattoo of an eagle on her left calf, just above her knee. It looked just like she did the original ink.</p> <p>"You like?" she asked me, her eyes still a little fluttering.</p> <p>I didn't speak, just stared openly, unable to take in the woman in front of me. I could do nothing but stare.</p> <p>"I've noticed you around the store," I said. "And when I came in, you were standing over me."</p> <p>"I was going to put you on a display floor," she said, as she put her arms up around my neck in a hug. And then, she pulled back and leaned in for a kiss.</p> <p>I'm sure if we had been alone again, I would have gotten what I've wanted all day. Our lips pressed together, our tongues dancing in each other's mouth. Before we knew it, she had unbuttoned my shirt and was running her hands over my stomach and chest. I swear, we were the aggressor, but I was so turned on that I couldn't think straight. She slowly pulled it out of my jeans and my shorts until her fingers could just reach my cock.</p> <p>I think she thought I would throw us both down right there, but we both went with the moment. In no time we were on our knees, kissing each other's faces and necks, nibbling on the other parts of our mouths and faces. I could feel her breath on my lips as I looked up at her, licking her lips a little, taking in her sweet taste. I could never get enough of her taste. Her lips were so soft, and every touch of them made my body quiver with anticipation.</p> <p>Then, I felt something warm, smooth, and rubbery against her lips. She was still sucking on me, as she used one of her hands to slowly run up and down my chest. I could feel her tongue gently circling the head of my cock as she gently bit down. It took all my restraint not to grab her head, push her face harder into my crotch, and fuck her brains out. And she did, sucking harder, biting down harder, until I was screaming with pleasure.</p> <p>"Oh, God!" she moaned, breaking her lip lock with my cock and licking it, getting it fully wet. Then, she started to put her fingers into her mouth and moan again, this time a little louder. She had this sexy grin on her face.</p> <p>"Do you like me?" she softly asked. "I'm just so glad it's you."</p> <p>She took her hand off my cock and grabbed it, rubbing the tip on her lips. I could barely hold my breath.</p> <p>"I love you, too, baby." I managed to whisper.</p> <p>She was still rubbing my cock with her hand, taking turns sucking it and licking it for a minute or two, before starting to rub my balls, which were so swollen I could feel them pulling up and down, waiting for her to wrap her lips around them.</p> <p>She licked my cock up to, but never quite going down it. She licked my balls. "I want to suck your cock all the way to your balls," she said.</p> <p>"Your tits are just so hot." I said as I grabbed her ponytail and pushed her back onto the hard floor. She looked at me with a smile from the ground, while reaching back to grab my cock.</p> <p>She looked up at me, licking her lips, before giving me a soft kiss. Then she was back on her knees, sucking me into her mouth, running her tongue over the tip. Her hand pumped up and down, rubbing my cock up and down. Her eyes were closed, biting her lip and moaning very loudly. She was like a woman possessed, sucking me into her mouth and squeezing my balls at the same time.</p> <p>This woman was so pretty. Even better than I could have expected.</p> <p>Her hand left my cock for me to take over. My hand wrapped around her ponytail in my handâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
