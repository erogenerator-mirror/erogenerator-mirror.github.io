It'll be a little more painful for both of us."</p> <p>"Don't think like that..."</p> <p>Her voice trailed off and she looked down at herself. The tears glistened like emeralds and threatened to roll down her cheeks.</p> <p>"Well, I hope you have a very thorough exam," I said.</p> <p>"Don't worry," she sighed. "I'm in an unusual state, and I'm very happy this is the reason you're out in the first place."</p> <p>Her smile stretched across her face. "Then I think I know a doctor and would be very appreciative..."</p> <p>*</p> <p>"What is the first thing that comes to my mind?" I asked her.</p> <p>She smiled. "Now, let's get to the main event, shall we?" And I moved down the aisle to get a look at the most precious thing in my life, a pair of white panties that were the first thing I ever bought when I was twenty.</p> <p>"They're white!" I said, with only a trace of trepidation.</p> <p>She gave a little smile. "Yeah -- I figured that was just a bit too much of a coincidence."</p> <p>"So, who is the lady at the register?" I asked.</p> <p>She reached under her seat and held the bag out to me. "This is my ex-wife, Mary," she said. "She's your aunt, remember?"</p> <p>"You left me last semester at school?" I wondered.</p> <p>"Sort of," she said.</p> <p>"Can't you find a way to make it up to me?"</p> <p>She rolled her eyes at me. "Okay, whatever that would be."</p> <p>I looked at her expectantly.</p> <p>"Is it possible to make love with this thing?" she smirked, pointing to the little package laying on the seat in front of us.</p> <p>"Of course," I said.</p> <p>That was all I needed. I tossed my bag onto the bench next to mine and moved towards her.</p> <p>"What do we really want?" I finally asked.</p> <p>Her smile widened and she put her hand on my cheek. "Trust me," she said.</p> <p>I looked over my shoulder at the woman we were leaving at the last minute and felt my face blush again -- she didn't know what was wrong with me. She kept staring at me, but her expression was neutral. That wasn't her first reaction, I guess.</p> <p>I turned to the lady at the register and we talked for a couple of minutes, exchanging small talk. Her name was Donna. She was about the same height as me, not as tall as I was -- twenty-five, with a little less than a six-pack over that, but thin like a lot of women; I didn't quite know what to make of her looks and her body shape -- no body hair but some soft landing strip, and I didn't have long hair; I was just a little too dark.</p> <p>While that kind of conversation was about Donna and I, we were getting a lot into the role of the couple in conversation, I could hear it well enough that our conversation wouldn't sound as if it was an attempt to get a date to the point of leaving us alone.</p> <p>Just as I began to think that this might be a pretty good opportunity, she looked back at me. "Is there a problem with the panties?" she asked.</p> <p>I held my hand up, motioning with my finger for her to move towards the chair so she could. "Not in the first place," I said.</p> <p>And with that, I stepped forward and pulled her to me. Our lips met and for a few seconds, each one felt an electric connection -- not just between me and her, but between all of us. My fingers explored every inch of her body -- I wanted to feel every inch of her -- and when our lips parted in slow motion, I let my tongue sneak out and run across them before my body took over.</p> <p>I felt Donna's body shiver while our mouths met. The kiss was deep and wet, my tongue sliding between inside and out of her mouth as we made out. A moment later, her hands were sliding up and down the front of my shirt. When I felt her fumble with the buttons, I reached down and began to pull my shirt out and off my shoulders.</p> <p>"Slow down cowboy," she whispered when I took all of it off. "I want you."</p> <p>I reached down and started pushing my way down to the floor in front of my feet.</p> <p>At that point, she took my shirt and put it on the bench.</p> <p>When I got down to myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
