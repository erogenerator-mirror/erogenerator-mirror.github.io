You're just another fuckin' piece of shit! He'd just fucking kill me for being what he said. The next words that came out of my mouth were: Fuck myself."</p> <p>As the image before her flashed through me my heart broke and my breath hissed out of my nose. I watched in horror as a long, slim strap fell to the ground. With it came what looked like a red silk corset that was made of heavy white lace fabric. It was at least four inches long, almost the width of my fingers. Like most corsets you could easily slide the corset on and you just had to try it on. The material was much softer than normal and even though I was a sucker for them, no one ever owned me in them. Of the three dresses I had in my closet that day I had the same corset that had become my favorite dress. Even back then.</p> <p>"Jesus Chris, that's beautiful! I have to have it on!" I begged.</p> <p>"You don't know how sexy you look!" was all he said.</p> <p>I was in a terrible state, the corset wasn't helping with getting the corset on. I turned away from him and slid my hands up the sleeves of my gown, lifting it up more to get comfortable. I kept telling myself that I wanted this as much as I could, but I couldn't deny how good it felt to look in a dress that barely reached her waist, then to run naked through the cold night air. I looked over at the front of the dress and saw that it was made of white silk. The corset covered her legs only, but if she walked out of the dress it left her legs slightly exposed. The corset made her look like something that could melt a statue right then and there. I could feel my pussy start to quiver, but it was just barely. I shook my head and I could see her shiver again; it was her neck that was shivering. I could feel my own legs quiver and my face flushing. I tried not to stare at her but my gaze kept returning to whatever it was that was going on. My eyes kept coming back to that red corset and I looked at the back of it. It looked as though it wasn't going to go no matter how much I wanted it on. I guess it wasn't going to go.</p> <p>"Oh my god!" I said aloud.</p> <p>I was right there in the middle of the room, naked except for my corset and my high top stockings. I had the best view of my entire body in these dresses and this time my pussy hadn't quivered. I looked back at my dress and couldn't believe I had just admitted it all. I looked down and saw my pussy had a strange look to it. I looked up and saw it was a different color, like I had just changed it from red to golden. I had to close the dress. I looked up at my dress. I looked at the corset too. It wasn't a corset. It was a long sleeve sleeve dress with a red top that clung to the small of my back like it was clinging to a tree. It was like the whole top was clinging to me in a way that it would cling to the bottom of the dress. The red corset had made her look like the most gorgeous girl I had ever seen. It was like nothing I had ever seen. It was like she was the most beautiful being on earth. I couldn't stand it anymore. I leaned forward towards it, my eyes still closed as I reached under myself to grasp the hemline of my dress. It came down easily over my knees. I leaned forward for a second and was finally able to get my mouth onto the corset. I felt like I was in a movie and all I could hear was my mind chanting, 'I want this!' as my lips made contact with that first ever thing that I had ever kissed. And this time I didn't get the feeling that I was gonna be the one in the movie. It wasn't. All of a sudden I felt my whole body shiver. And for a second or so, I was startled out of my stupor. I looked over to where my dress was and saw a pair of beautiful, almost silver dollar colored heels on my feet. I leaned up a little bit and looked at them, feeling proud that I wore them.</p> <p>"Oh my fucking!" I said aloud. "This was pretty good shit."</p> <p>But then I started to look at the top of the dress again. The corset had made my top part ride up high enough to show off my ample breasts. I stared at the dress for a few moments as I tried to decide what I wanted to do next. I saw a few more corsets of my own fall toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
