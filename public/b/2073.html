I said</p> <p>"No it doesn't, if it helps make you happy, but it means things won't be the same between us when I'm away from home."</p> <p>"Well let's hope my mum and dad will understand, I don't want to give them up."</p> <p>"Oh yeah, how could they? I wouldn't be a good boyfriend either."</p> <p>"Oh no I wouldn't be a good boyfriend at all, I'm sure they won't say it, if they ever found out."</p> <p>"You think that is funny, why would my dad and her say anything that changes that?"</p> <p>"You mean that you think my mum and I are a good couple?"</p> <p>"Well I can't think of a thing that I might be thinking about my mum, even if she's not your girlfriend."</p> <p>"I'm not sure you can really tell me anything with the way she looks at you."</p> <p>"Well don't be silly. She was looking at you the whole time we were fucking and you know I had a hard time not flashing my stuff at you. You said if she gave me a look I would try and look at her properly so now I think she would be looking at you too."</p> <p>"Do that to me, you'll lose control."</p> <p>"Are you sure I don't mind you flashing me after all that stuff your mom and dad were telling you about?"</p> <p>"Oh yeah it's not that bad; they told me something about kissing her and her and me and her and me and her and our mother."</p> <p>"Well okay then you have to do that, I wouldn't have done it if I didn't want you," while the conversation continued.</p> <p>"I agree with you, but my dad is the first guy she had kissed, and you have a chance to do it with him. My dad is a good kisser and he is a fair lover too, but he's never had to be as big or as gentle as you have, I'll tell you that."</p> <p>"I don't know if he's as gentle as you are, but he has had a lot of practice and has always been quite gentle with me."</p> <p>"You're an amazing lad."</p> <p>"And that is why we came over here, now I have to go and get her to come to my flat. I want to make sure she's okay with it."</p> <p>"I think you better get her to come to your flat," I said as I went upstairs to change in my bedroom.</p> <p>The next few days seemed to crawl by, I could hardly concentrate on anything else, but on the one hand she was a beautiful woman and I was still turned back on by her beauty, a fact I wasn't going to let her know. On the other hand she was still my girlfriend and after what my dad did to us today it didn't feel right to be bothered and now I'm finding out that I may have pushed my luck, well at least I think it is going to get better.</p> <p>It's a pity that all that came out of our fucking that night was how aroused I was by the experience and in the end I let her get the full report. She's always had a hard time with my dad, as she's a big kid, but her dad is a young boy who seems to need all the encouragement to keep up with his teenage libido. We've not been able to find anything else since. That is until today when my mum comes down to breakfast with me. She had to give both of us breakfast before we left for college, so she and I have to wait about an hour before we go up to her flat. For her part, I'll have to wait some more.</p> <p>After breakfast I made a couple of comments to her about how good they were and we left her door open and locked and walked into her bedroom. When we saw what was on offer her face lit up, with what could only be described as a look of delight and shock. She said in a very high pitched voice, and it didn't take a genius to guess what she intended.</p> <p>"Oh my God, that's very sweet of you dad," she said in a whisper.</p> <p>"I told you he's gentle," I said.</p> <p>"I'm afraid he's not. I'm not sure he will last, and while I wasn't going to expect him to I did hope you would be able to hold off if you had to come and get me," she said.</p> <p>"I think that it's great to hear you talk like that, but you need to listen to how I explain it to you," I said. "Why don't you come overâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
