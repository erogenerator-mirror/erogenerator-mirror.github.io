I reached for her, and we embraced again, deeply, our lips locked, our tongues entwining, and she was kissing me so deeply and passionately that my hands wandered over her body.</p> <p>One of her hands moved from my face and slid down across her flat belly. My fingers slid into her, and I held a breast and gently caressed it back and forth. She was still sitting on the couch, and she reached beneath me, and caressed my bottom with her hand, then reached farther up, and finally found my nipple and gently pulled it and pinched it between her fingers. I couldn't stand it, so I pressed her against the front of the couch and moved my hand between us, to caress her back.</p> <p>In response, she started to move toward me. I backed up a little, so that our lips were almost touching. "Hold on...don't move" I whispered. She turned to face me as I reached out and put my hands on her breasts, and my fingers lightly trailed over her nipples, which were still erect and hard. She kissed me again, our kiss deepening, and our passion growing.</p> <p>As we kissed, and started kissing, her hand wandered from my breast downward and cupped my sex and found my pussy-juices, and her fingers entered me and cupped me. They made tiny strokes...I guess they found my G-spot because I couldn't hold back any further and said, almost frantically, "HARDER!".</p> <p>I couldn't hold back much longer, and I felt like my back would bow any moment. I was so ready for some sort of release (something I had never done!) and I pushed into her. Her fingered began to slide into me, and I started to come.</p> <p>"OH - OH - OH - OH - FUCK ME!" I let go, and she began to stroke with me and felt me coming again.</p> <p>I collapsed on her, both of us breathless.</p> <p>Then she lifted her hand from around mine, pulled me close, and said, "you've never been with a girl before", and in a soft, loving voice she said, "no one's ever made love more passionately than me" and kissed me one last time on the lips.</p> <p>A feeling of loss and loneliness overcame me as I stood in front of her, my mind filled with my memories of the night.</p> <p>But, as I walked slowly away, I felt that something more had happened, perhaps because of my experiences with her and our mutual orgasms. There had been a wonderful, sexual night, but even more incredible, we had shared the intimacy of our desires, feelings, and fantasies. The last time we made love, she held me like that, her hands around my neck, and her breasts against my back.</p> <p>At some point in the evening, I walked back to the couch. "That was the most amazing, erotic, exciting, and sexually exciting night that I've ever had, John! We're making a difference in our lives."</p> <p>"Yes, she said, "but it wasn't a 'lesser' than last night, it has been just the most amazing night of your life."</p> <p>We kissed again. And we were just talking.</p> <p>We kissed some more, and I went to brush my teeth. "I've got to run, John, but I'm going to the shower", and she gave me a little squeeze and I turned off the shower. She got out of the tub and wrapped a towel around herself, and I dried and combed my hair.</p> <p>We went back into her apartment and lay down in each other's arms. I told her some of the story of what happened with the young girl. She was a wonderful actress, and she played the seductress as much as I did, and she had a great personality. She was very submissive, and we were both very eager to know some more.</p> <p>But, we both loved the idea of making love together, and our lovemaking started as a relationship, not a physical thing, but our relationship. We continued to be with each other, and to see if we could make a difference, but as this was an extended relationship, we were just there and exploring each other. And it was great!</p> <p>Part 2</p> <p></p> <p>The following weekend, while we were preparing on Tuesday morning, a lot of things had changed. I had seen her a couple times, but it was mostly her doing, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
