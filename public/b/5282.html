With one hand, she grasped his thickened head and stroked it from the backside, up and down before sliding him inside. Their lips met again. This time, she was kissing him like lovers would, and he found that he was kissing her with more passion. When they finally came up for air, she took him in her hand and squeezed it, causing the taut skin there to tauten and tighten.</p> <p>"Honey, I want you to do this." She told him.</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"I need you to take me, and I want you to fuck me, hard."</p> <p>"You want me to fuck you now?" He asked with wonder.</p> <p>"Yes, yes, I want to be fucked hard." She said, and with that, she pulled herself away from him. She stood up on the table, pulled up a chair and sat beside him. Then she leaned back and spread her legs. She had to lean her head back, the angle made things awkward, and when she looked at him, he quickly looked away.</p> <p>"Honey, come to me. It's time, you know you want it and you know I want it. Please come to me." She whispered, and slowly bent forward, placing her mouth at his, kissing him deeply. Her body was quivering when their kiss broke. She stood up, still on her knees, and slowly pulled her skirt up, revealing a neatly trimmed strip of wild ginger hair in the shape of a heart. And then, standing in front of him, she moved down to take him into her mouth, taking him almost right into the back of her throat. He groaned and leaned back on the chair. He ran his hands through her raven hair as she took him deep into her mouth, and pulled off slightly and looked up at him.</p> <p>"Do you want me to stop? Do you not want to come while you're doing this?" She asked him as she sucked more rapidly on his tip.</p> <p>"Oh God yes." He groaned.</p> <p>She continued, taking him deeper and moving it faster, holding his shaft with her left hand, stroking his length, taking him into her mouth and holding his head with her right hand, her mouth working on him furiously. She was on a sexual high, and that excited her. It drove her on to the edge too. Her moans filled the store space and as she sucked him, he felt his balls begin to swell. "Hurry up, hurry up, baby, I'm gonna come!" He pleaded.</p> <p>She stopped her efforts, and pushed him back into the chair. She climbed backwards onto him, holding himself up with a free arm. He grabbed her, holding her body so as not to get into a deep kiss, but as she lowered herself, he guided the tips of his toes into the hot moistness of her pussy. When he felt her body shiver, he increased the rhythm of his toes, moving them in unison with the one on her clitoris. When she was screaming, he held her body to him in the chair and pumped his hips upwards, feeling her wetness coat him as she convulsed around him. She fell off of him and lay on top of him as she caught her breath. He kissed her, deeply, and licked at her lips.</p> <p>"I'm so sorry, I can't believe what I just did. All I can say is that I'm going to do this every time I have a chance. I don't even know how. Okay, I'm good." She laughed as she kissed him, and she reached for the button on his pants. She was a little slower than he was, but after about five seconds, she felt her insides quake a second time. He stood up with his pants still down at his ankles and she slid her blouse down as far as she could and pulled his jeans down his legs. He stepped out of them as she slid his boxers past his cock, and stood beside him. They kissed again, holding each other, as she lowered her panties. They sat down, his cock at her cunt lips once again, and she leaned back against him, his cock still thrusted in her cunt. They kissed again and he felt himself enter her a third time. He had an urge to just keep moving in her, but he wanted to enjoy being inside of her as much as possible. As the end of his cock entered her pussy she reached under herself to play with herself, she was so tight, so wet, and so wet. It was almost like she was the only thing separating them in her mind, she was all that and more. He was in a daze, and just as she reached for his cock again, he felt the warm wetness that had coated him with her excitementâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
