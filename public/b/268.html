"I just can't! I really can't!" I gasped for breath.</p> <p>We both looked over at him and stared at each other for maybe five or ten seconds. I could see that he was completely confused because I never said a thing. I got to my feet and slowly took off my towel. He stood with a stunned look on his face like an idiot. I started for the door and he grabbed my hand and just walked me to the bathroom. I just looked at him as he undid his towel and just started running a hand through his blonde hair. He pulled me close and with kisses I just could not take anymore."</p> <p>"Well let's see how this feels", he said and gently took me in his arms and kissed me. I could taste his tongue as we kissed. This is a kiss that I have dreamed of forever. His soft lips and warm tongue felt so good against mine. I had not expected such a kiss to come to this, not like this, like this right now. I just melted into his arms and we kissed, slowly and lovingly. Suddenly, as it had gotten longer, he took his hands off my face and wrapped them around my body pulling me against him. I felt his erection on my hip bone and his hands were all over my ass and legs, and then down to my thigh rubbing them back and forth. I let out a sigh that I will never forget because his fingers ran up my thigh to the edge of my pussy. I just could not help it. He reached down and caressed my clit. I just stood there with my mouth open staring at him. My eyes were slightly watery and my mouth was full of air. I couldn't catch my breath. Suddenly, our kiss broke and he just smiled at me like a kid that had just lost its best friend by a dozen in a hot tub and was giving me another good hug! As he hugged me I had my hand on his dick and it was pushing back and forth over and around against his boxers. It felt so nice and hard. I had never felt like this.</p> <p>When my lips went back to his and we started kissing again, I could feel him getting harder as I stroked up and down his shaft. Once he had kissed me and was standing there with a boner, I could not get him up any longer. I told him I had to have him in me. He helped me out of my clothes as I helped lay down on the bed. He took off his boxers and I layed down on the bed and spread my legs wide apart. He pushed his head between my legs and licked me very gently. My pussy started to tingle like it never has been before. The feeling sent shivers through me and the thought of what he was doing to me was making me wet just as it was when it was him doing it to me in the tub. He took his hands and spread me so that he could get his tongue on me even more. He started sucking so I could feel my body tremble with anticipation. He licked my pussy like it was a desert without a sun. I could feel my hips move up and down trying to get my pussy closer to his mouth so that he could get deeper.</p> <p>I wanted him to go faster. I wanted to feel him and hear him go as hard as I feel him going. I wanted to cum so bad that I couldn't breathe at all. I told him that before he kissed me it would be so nice to kiss him and to just let it all happen. He just leaned up a bit and put me in the middle of the bed. I could feel his cock and balls over on my thigh and knew that he was now going to slide himself into me. I tried to sit up, to put some pressure on the head, to push him all the way inside me. But the best way of doing that was using just my hips and legs, so that he could rub himself up and down on my clit on his up strokes. I could feel his chest pressed into the bed against me through his thin shirt.</p> <p>The more I thought about it the more I wanted to do that. He would go fast and then slow, but he would slow and slow until I was ready to cum. He would slowly pull out of me until his balls were still hanging down inside my pussy. I loved when his balls pulled his cock up and then slid back down into me, but I wanted him to fuck me fast and hard.</p> <p>Now there is that word. I know it is bad, but that word is a great way to describe his hard cock. There was a moment where my hips were on the edge of the bed with him still in me and I could feel him grinding his hips so as just felt him inside me. I reached down and started to stroke myself. Then it hit me.
