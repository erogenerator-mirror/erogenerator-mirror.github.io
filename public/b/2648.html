But it was like I was drowning in his eyes, as he said that he could never be with another woman, but I'd never be able to stop myself from wanting him too.</p> <p>"I'm gonna tell you something," I continued when I saw he had a serious frown on his face. "Last night...." He took my hand and I gasped.</p> <p>What had started out as a quick fuck seemed to slow down to a crawl. His arms, which had remained wrapped around me for the longest time, were now wrapped around mine, his arms tight around me, pushing us both into a deep kiss as our bodies melted away with my arms around his neck. I could feel the bulge in his briefs pressing into my stomach and he slowly lowered my legs from his body with my legs still wrapped around his waist.</p> <p>"You still want my body don't you?" He whispered against the shell of my ear, "Don't you?" He whispered, "You haven't answered me yet...."</p> <p>"YES!" I shrieked at him, "I want your body!"</p> <p>He laughed and he lifted me up, our bodies still locked together again, his dick still firmly in my pussy. As he wrapped me in his strong arms, we kissed. I could tell that I could still feel his thick cock inside me, feel the strength of it as it filled me from the inside, and I could feel him pressing into me with each movement that he made his hips.</p> <p>"Oh, God," He said looking at me with a grin on his face. "You're so beautiful...."</p> <p>We kissed again, holding each other in our arms, both panting for air. I felt my legs weakening in one last rush of adrenaline as he broke our kiss, his hard dick still in me.</p> <p>"We've only just begun," he whispered to me, "but you'll be able to do it again, won't you?!" He said in a soft voice.</p> <p>"Mmm..hmmm...." I mumbled, my head falling back, "I will......" I gasped as his dick slowly slid out of me, his cum still leaking out of I pussy down my leg.</p> <p>He kissed me again as he carried me back to my bed and laid me down on it. He started kissing me again as he slid his hands down over my body with each movement he made. I could hear his teeth click-clicking as he slowly made his way to my neck, stopping only to take a breath and then kissing it, nibbling and pulling with every kiss.</p> <p>"God," he said as he kissed and licked my collarbone, my chest, and my navel. "You taste good!" He said in his soft voice. He nibbled my stomach. I was surprised at the fact that he continued to make his way down toward my pussy. I lifted my hands over his head and pulled him toward me as he laid on top of me.</p> <p>I lifted his face to look at it. His eyes were closed as he inhaled my beautiful womanhood again. "Oh, God, Oh, God," I said again as he began to lick first my thighs, working his way up to my pussy.</p> <p>"You're gonna make me cum again, don't you?" He asked as he stopped licking and kissed my vagina, then kissed its underside.</p> <p>I wanted my hips to move against his mouth and cock simultaneously, to make him suck my pussy. It would be too easy at that point. I could barely breathe, my legs shaking weakly now. "Uh...." I said as he began to lick my inner thighs. He did as I asked as my hips writhed against his face. "Oh, God," I moaned as he began to move down my body.</p> <p>He stopped licking as I gasped, "Don't stop!" when I looked down at him. The lust that I was feeling was too strong now. His tongue felt like it was moving in a snake as it licked my skin. His eyes were closed as he kissed every inch of my thighs, then moved over them and kissed them. Every inch of my skin seemed to touch the fire. I opened my legs as much as possible, and he was between them now, his face covered in my pussy, his lips locked around my clit as his tongue made contact with my outer lips. "I love you so much", I whispered as I felt the first wave of orgasm hit me at last.</p> <p>He lifted himself as his tongue continued its work, lapping the length of my pussy, making me jerk and then let out another loud moan as his tongue found my asshole.</p> <p>I wrapped my legs around his head, my back arched, lifting myself up into his face.
