"I'm sorry, that was very rude of me."</p> <p>Breathing heavily, she said, "No, no, no, don't worry. I'm just trying to be a good hostess. I would prefer if I were allowed to see you and have a chance to talk to you."</p> <p>"Is it ok?"</p> <p>Nathanael chuckled, "Of course it is. How can I ever thank you, ma'am?"</p> <p>"I don't know what I expected but, I couldn't get through the next few hours looking at you."</p> <p>"I was planning to stay and talk to you but, I need to get changed before we start," Athanasia said.</p> <p>"I understand, I will take this slow. I'm sure you're tired but, you shouldn't need your night clothes on very long."</p> <p>Beneath him, Athanasia felt the warmth of his touch, not of a vampire. It was a long time since a vampire had touched her. It made her ache that a woman would be so... possessive toward a woman. She had seen so much in the past few hours. She did not want to ruin it.</p> <p>Athanasia stood and walked toward the bedroom. She saw Nathanael and smiled, "Let us begin the night now." She reached out and touched his cheek saying, "I'm pleased to meet you Athanasia. I hope you can still see the light." She grabbed his hand and walked through the lobby. She took a deep breath and called out her name, "Nathanael,"</p> <p>The room was empty but for the sound of a zipper. Athanasia turned and knelt to take out his clothes. She glanced over her shoulder and saw his eyes staring back at her. She blushed when she realized they locked on her. She slowly undressed his shoes and socks, unbuttoned his shirt and pulled it off. As she lowered his pants, she pulled his shirt off. She felt his hardness growing harder. When her fingers touched its head, he shivered. "Did you enjoy the show Athanasia?"</p> <p>"Sure," she replied, kneeling to remove his pants, which dropped to the floor. His hard shaft bobbed up and down as she stood. "Your hard cock looks so beautiful." She leaned back to take him in her hands. "You may have to stand over there..."</p> <p>Nathanael stood in the corner holding his rock hard shaft. As his member got harder, he moved back from her. "I was afraid this night would end soon." He spoke to no one in particular. He was aware that Athanasia's hand was in his lap and touching his hard cock. "Your hard dick is very beautiful Athanasia," he said softly, "You are very sexy." He paused then continued, "...very sexy." He smiled thinking he might like it.</p> <p>Nathanasia stepped closer to him and wrapped her arms around his neck. "Nate, I'm very attracted to you and I want you to take my virginity today. I'm ready to lose it."</p> <p>Nadanael didn't know if she heard Athanasia right because it was too out of her. The moment he turned the knob and the door to shut it, he heard her whisper, "Nate, no." It was so quiet. He walked silently to the night table and pulled the blanket out from underneath it. He carefully removed the condom before opening the packet and placing a large glob over his penis, covering it with the condom's contents. He turned to Nadanaes to see if she needed a moment.</p> <p>He took the condom and put it on and then slowly slid it on. Nadanaesa watched him. She had watched his every move many times before and it always made her feel very privileged to have seen it being done. "Oh, Nate, you are so beautiful," she muttered and then closed in.</p> <p>Nathanaanasia's body tingled when she saw his penis entering her moist vagina. She had never been sure of a penis before but she was more experienced in having it in her. She closed her eyes. It was wonderful. The warm softness and the feeling were nothing compared to the feeling they created inside her. Nathanaesa felt her body was alive. She moved, her hips slowly, against the warm, strong man's hips. She loved every bit of sensation as she slowly began to grind her hips.</p> <p>Nathanasia watched her face. The heat generated by her lust was a pleasant contrast to the feeling in her vagina. She wanted to keep riding his cock but she wanted to wait and enjoy herself to the fullest. Athanasia had been waiting her entire life for this moment and she didn't want it to end. She wanted the ultimate pleasure of taking it inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
