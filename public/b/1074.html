"We better sit down."</p> <p>The two stood and made their way, stopping only when they were far enough away to be within arm's reach. It was very uncomfortable and they both knew it. Finally they stopped, sitting down on their chairs in the middle of the kitchen bench.</p> <p>Liam smiled. "So, what do you think?"</p> <p>"It is hard to say, but it was very nice, thank you very much!"</p> <p>"Oh, don't stop," she said, and took his hand, pulling it to her lips. "You're as much a part of this as anyone I've ever met!"</p> <p>Liam looked around. The sun was just now starting to rise. The small kitchen would probably be the last place he would ever venture. He looked over.</p> <p>"I think I can do one last job!" Elizabeth said, smiling broadly. "Make sure you eat everything, too."</p> <p>He smiled. He knew that she could do this, and probably many more. "You always know how to give a lady a big tip in that department!" he joked.</p> <p>"Thank you, and again, and by the way, you made it a very nice tip!" she said, and then blushed. She took his forearm in her hand, stroking it.</p> <p>"I'm glad we're together again now, Elizabeth, it's been too long! I never expected it to be this easy. I just hope you can still be happy to spend your life with me!"</p> <p>She nodded, looking for all the world like she had forgotten she even existed. Then she said, "If you're happy to spend your life with me, why don't you come up next door and let me try it?"</p> <p>"And if I don't like it?"</p> <p>"I could help make it an even more enjoyable time for you," she laughed, and he smiled.</p> <p>"Elizabeth, you're not being very fair, and I think you're just a bit too stubborn."</p> <p>"Why do you think I try to fight back like you are," she asked. "It's my way of telling you how my life really is."</p> <p>"You're more than just my way of teaching me!" he said, but his voice was hard. "It's the way of a family. It's what it is."</p> <p>She turned to him, hugging herself fiercely as she did, holding him tight and crying softly. "You're not making it any easier to tell," she said. "Maybe I'll come see you."</p> <p>Liam's heart leapt. Elizabeth thought she could see it in his eyes! "Please, Elizabeth," he whispered. "I hope I can get through this."</p> <p>He looked around. "What are we going to do?" she asked. She had put on her most cheerful show, but his heart felt like it was going to burst out of his chest. She was right, he was right a lot, and he knew it and more than anything else. "But do you have any idea what I was going to ask that would keep things going so smoothly?" he asked.</p> <p>She laughed. "I don't know, I've seen that look when you wanted to make a point, but how could I ever ask you to spend more time with me? I don't want you to spend as long with a boyfriend as you're spending with a boyfriend!"</p> <p>"Don't you dare change your mind," he said, and took her hands in his and looked her deeply in the eyes. "This whole relationship thing, it makes the best of each person's future."</p> <p>"Maybe it's a good thing to give it a shot."</p> <p>Liam laughed, putting his arm around her shoulder and pulling her close. She smiled, kissing his cheek. "Don't just let it go to waste," he said, pulling back. "I'm serious. You'll love this, you'll really love being with me!" He looked over her shoulder as he leaned down, and leaned into her.</p> <p>Elizabeth's lips felt swollen, and she pressed her face against his, trying to get as close to him as possible. Her eyes had the softness of liquid fire and the warmness of love.</p> <p>"Thank you, Elizabeth, that was very kind." He pulled her a little closer, his lips brushing her earlobe. "But I don't think we've really had a chance to spend much time together," he said.</p> <p>She smiled. "I think you're right," she chuckled. "I would be glad to see you again!"</p> <p>"And why don't we just get into things a bit faster, Elizabeth. I know we've only just met, but we could make a really great couple!"</p> <p>She smiled, and he leaned into her again.
