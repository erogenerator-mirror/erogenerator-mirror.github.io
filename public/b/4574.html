But I think today, today my boyfriend is going to show off his sexy wife, and then I think I might be tempted to get lucky or not!"</p> <p>As she thought, her heart was beating faster and she felt herself blush as she looked at herself in the mirror.</p> <p>She continued applying her make up. This would be quite the look, she thought to herself, so she brushed her long brown hair, and then brushed some lipstick over her lips, making sure she made her sexy smoky eye lashes look longer than she had so far.</p> <p>Looking at herself in the mirror, she could hardly believe what was happening to her. The man she loved, the love of her marriage, her life, and the passion she felt for him to be her new boyfriend, a perfect lover and husband!</p> <p>The idea of going out to dinner was also enticing, even before getting dressed. She had a feeling that she would not be able to control herself when it came time to go to dinner with him!</p> <p>Getting dressed she felt she owed it to her man to know that she was a sexy and sexy woman, and his sexy, sexy wife.</p> <p>The dinner she had been dying to have before the evening arrived, and knew she was too, but decided to go out to the hotel to spend the evening with another man who really wanted her to be a sexy and sexy woman.</p> <p>She got dressed feeling as sexy as the day she had been born. She would give up anything else to have him please her in the way she wanted.</p> <p>As she opened the door to the restaurant, she noticed a waiter smiling at her, and knowing that no matter how sexy she was, there will always be some guy to make her come, and probably be with her, too. She was tempted to give him a quick kiss, but decided not to.</p> <p>As he walked away from her and started to enter the restaurant, he glanced back at her and then at the waiter as he walked past, and walked on by.</p> <p>She watched his ass as he walked away, knowing he was as sexy as he looked, and knew that he would please her.</p> <p>Her fingers trembled as she watched him, and her heart was skipping beats, and she could not believe she was enjoying herself so, and had been since she got up this morning!</p> <p>As she sat down, she felt her thighs tingle and she wanted to pull up his pants and hold him close and kiss him softly.</p> <p>"Wow, that was unexpected, but I think the restaurant was not so bad after all!" she thought to herself. "I wonder if I should try to work the waiter's uniform so I can change my panties, and see if he noticed my lingerie."</p> <p>He returned his attention quickly to her and smiled again as she continued to work on his new dress.</p> <p>She could feel the excitement building inside her as he stood up in front of her, then moved and wrapped something around his neck, neck and chest. "This is for your benefit," he told her, pulling a blindfold out of his bag, as he stood her up and slipped it on her wrists and her arms.</p> <p>"I'll pick those up when we get back here," she whispered to herself and then watched as he went to the door.</p> <p>After a few minutes of walking the street and talking with him, they arrived at the restaurant. He smiled at her as they walked in, and she smiled back, hoping she would be able to take him as he took her, again.</p> <p>They sat across the table from each other and waited for him to get seated.</p> <p>Before he sat down he ordered her to please herself. "I want you to show me what a sexy, sexy wife you are again!"</p> <p>This is it she thought, he will be here in five minutes and he will make a sexy show for me. She felt so excited that she could hold her breath, knowing that he could see her glisten wetly. She had never looked like this before, and as she looked at his sexy, sexy wife, she thought what a great idea it would be to dress like a man!</p> <p>"I like your new dress, and will like it just as much as I would like it to be," she smiled again at him.</p> <p>He smiled back and turned to her, still not sure what to say.</p> <p>"You don't need it anymore, and I have something that I think you might like."</p> <p>She looked him in the eyes and saw his uncertainty, as he spoke.</p> <p>"I have this new dress for you to try on!"
