A thousand reds were a little over the limit for me, but not a lot was too far. My head was spinning just thinking about how we would just go out to dinner and have a few drinks. I couldn't think of why, that's for me, not for him. I decided I didn't need to worry about him having any idea what was going on in his mind. He didn't do anything to stop that plan though. For me it was just a normal part of the morning: work, dinner and a drink.</p> <p>I got up in the middle of the day and went into his room. I was trying to be casual as I walked in while I was trying to get dressed for work; I wasn't so sure I could be a real good manager so early in the day, but his idea of a good time was to go out, not do any work. I knew I was definitely in a position to get my mind off work. By the time I was ready to leave for work I was ready for anything. I took a seat on his bed and started the car up. I'm not sure if it's all the thoughts going through my head right now, what I wanted to be doing while I was in a hotel room, but I didn't care; I just wanted to be in his room that night. He was just a normal college student: not a college student and definitely not a student.</p> <p>I reached the bottom of the elevator and as it stopped in his room door and opened the door the light went on and he came to the bed. I could hear his breathing from outside of the door and I could make out what I thought he was telling me. "C" said, "I'm not as good at it as you but I have to try for my position. I'm going to be working full time for the next two weeks and I hope you aren't going to leave anything to chance." His hand came up to the back of my head and pressed a kiss to my mouth.</p> <p>"Of course you aren't going anywhere." I said, moving my lips just a little higher than his. A kiss I felt sure would never be a sexual thing, but it was. I'd heard so much about the "southern lifestyle." You know how every girl at the frat starts with a little bit on the cheek and then a bit of a kiss for a little bit on the cheek until they're about to hit the "southern dance?" If I was feeling bold with my kiss I'd say that's right; if I was a little less daring I'd say that's right too. I turned my face back onto his and we started kissing. I don't mean the little pecks on either cheek like I'd always done with him before, but this was more than kissing. I started a slow up and down of the length of his tongue and then his lips. I had never kissed someone with his tongue in my mouth and I was sure he was taking his time giving me more time to work with it in my own mouth. I guess he was pretty good at not making it too easy on myself. I know he was getting pretty worked up and I don't even think he could stop himself.</p> <p>I continued to kiss down his neck and into his hair. He was pulling me closer to him and I knew he could feel how hard my nipples were now. I could tell he had gotten really worked up after his last kiss. He began to slide his right hand down my stomach until it was on the bottom of my bathing suit. He ran his fingers up and down the sides and then cupped my pussy. Now that it was happening a little bit of pressure. At first I thought he was just rubbing me over to get me to go on a date or something, but he wasn't. I put my hand down to his chest just to make sure and felt how his muscles worked. I was a little confused because he had never done this before and I wasn't sure I understood the way his body and the sensations were affecting me. I felt sort of like a slut, but more importantly it was exciting.</p> <p>I finally had to get ready to go to work so I stood up and I went into his room to change. I don't know why I did it. I know I wanted to look good for him, but I just found it just a little too easy. I was almost glad to get something casual and he was going to be back early. I was just about to turn when he came back.</p> <p>"What are you doing up here?" I said.</p> <p>He just stood there and let me do the talking from his mouth. We went to breakfast together. It was a little awkward at first, but he was never too embarrassed getting out of it. We both got a small break and spent time together and I got toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
