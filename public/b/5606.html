There was a dark figure standing behind the bar. I knew it must be Mark. I knew I couldn't take this chance. He must have sensed my fear.</p> <p>"Please come dance with me." I said.</p> <p>He turned a bright red but nodded and led me out of the club. Once again we passed an unopened bottle of water at the bar.</p> <p>"Take a look at this," he said.</p> <p>I took in my reflection in the full length mirror. I put my hand to my face and turned to look at my breasts. They were not as full as a C cup but they still looked very desirable. I noticed my nipples, erect and poking against the thin material of my dress.</p> <p>"I love this view!" I exclaimed.</p> <p>"It's nothing to be insecure about. But not to you at least," he said. "Just dance with me!"</p> <p>He led me to the dance floor. We held hands and began to dance together slowly. The music was soft and sensual and I closed my eyes as my hips moved in rhythm with the dancing.</p> <p>He began to kiss my neck. He cupped my breasts and rubbed my nipples with his thumbs. Their shape fascinated him. His other hand explored between my body and my body. He was breathing in my scent and his body felt so warm with the feel of my breasts beneath his skin. He could feel every movement, every shudder. It was all he could do to keep from touching me again. I could feel his heat even through the thin material of his pants but he seemed to know that I was too aroused.</p> <p>He took my hand and we began dancing more urgently. He had slipped his hand under my dress and was feeling my aroused pussy lips. He was pushing his fingers hard against my lips and then pushing in just a little. I found it hard to concentrate on the dance but was willing not to ruin the mood. We were moving with the music and he was moving his hands all over me. My whole body was on fire with desire.</p> <p>As we were dancing I slipped my hand down his pants and began to caress him through his thin shorts. I could feel his throbbing cock and knew that he would soon be able to force its way into me. I unbuttoned his pants and slowly let them fall around his ankles.</p> <p>His cock was rock hard and I knew that he wasn't able to wait and he reached a hand down and ran it along my moist entrance. My hips were writhing on the floor with the force of him pressing against me.</p> <p>"You're so wet, you're so excited!" he exclaimed.</p> <p>I could feel his fingers in my moist hole. This was all it took for me to cum immediately.</p> <p>"Oh yes!" I said. I was overcome with passion and need, in a trance like state. I was so excited and so hot!</p> <p>"You can feel my swollen cock against your pussy, in your juices!" he said.</p> <p>I felt him move his cock between my lips and heard my own moan escape through the songâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
