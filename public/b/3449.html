I'm a little short...I can do it. Don't think about it. Ok?"</p> <p>"I think I can handle it. I've read about being dominant and having to be dominated. I want to be able to let my own body be dominated to the point of needing something to say or do. You can be strong and independent but I'd go along with it. I'm not really that much of a sub in that situation, you know...I haven't had many friends and I've spent a lot of time in denial about it. But I find it very exciting...feeling your submission." His cock twitched and she felt it.</p> <p>"I'm not that way. I've never done it."</p> <p>"You'll never be submissive to me. We'll discuss things later, ok? Take off your clothes. Please."</p> <p>"But I've never done this...before."</p> <p>"No. You will do it. You'll take my cum inside you while being dominated, right? That's so hot."</p> <p>"I don't want to be submissive...but...I need to...to."</p> <p>"Hang on...we'll do this, ok? I need to go get ready for work now. What are you doing? Don't get dressed while I'm gone." She hung a couple paper towels over the wall to keep the dripping from their hot bodies but didn't bother with panties and bra. She got up and headed for the bathroom, not thinking to dress as casually as she might, since she would have gotten cold.</p> <p>As soon as she returned a few minutes later, she saw him getting dressed. At first she thought he'd left the room. Then it was clear he was putting on a sexy teddy.</p> <p>"Hang on a second." They began getting undressed, both of them watching closely for him to leave. They walked through a shower together, then he dried their dripping naked bodies with a towel, drying each as close as he could get. He got back with another towel and wrapped it around her legs, then he wrapped the towel around her. As he got to her thighs he grabbed hers and pulled them apart.</p> <p>"God you're beautiful...I want to lick you." He took a step forward when he saw her blush.</p> <p>"Wait, not here."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"I wouldn't want you to think I'm some kind of weirdo."</p> <p>"No...because I'm a virgin." He saw her blush and pulled up the towel and kissed her. "Just a nice young lady and you look very nice like that."</p> <p>"Are you trying to tell me you're not into that?"</p> <p>"No...but please don't stop," and he lowered his mouth and licked, sucked and kissed his way down her stomach. When he got to her pussy he licked it, tasting her and rubbing his tongue up and down against her swollen lips. He pushed his face deep into her and sucked her clit. He could hear her sighing and squirming around and he licked until she reached down and put his fingers in him, rubbing his own hard cock so that she could watch. Her hips were moving and he could tell she was loving it, too.</p> <p>"I want you inside me...right now."</p> <p>"But...I've been really...jacking off," he saw her blush and smiled wickedly. He kissed her clit, then slowly opened her and guided his cock in. He pushed in and she moaned and sighed, loving the feel of his warmth as he slipped into her. When he was fully inside she reached down and put his hands on her back to steady herself and he began moving. They were in perfect rhythm as she felt him touching her everywhere inside her body. He loved the feel of her soft skin and it was just so comfortable to have her against him as he was inside her. He pulled and pushed while her hips moved in time to his. Their bodies slid against one another in perfect harmony. He held himself above her as his cock slid all the way in with one long stroke.</p> <p>"Fuck me...fuck...fuck me," she cried out.</p> <p>He started moving, pulling completely out and pushing in, then pulling out, back and forth.</p> <p>"Oh God...Oh God...Oh God," she cried and cried.</p> <p>"You love that don't you?" he asked, and as he pulled out, he could feel her clench around him. They moaned together as her hands moved down to his hips and she pulled him tight. He pushed forward and could feel the warm, wet walls on his pole.</p> <p>"Please...fuck me...fuck me..." She couldn't describe how her pussy felt. It felt wonderful to be completely filled up and his balls wereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
