All six of them seemed very friendly, but when she asked one of them if they could give her another hand massage, one of them was only half-hearted, saying that some were more than willing. She made them laugh and it seemed like they did this often, making the women blush and ask her how many times she had gotten them all in one night when she couldn't seem to get it right. They also asked her if she would be up to dancing again, and she was very happy to help them out with that. She really couldn't believe the amount of money they were making, even if it was just for the next three weekends.</p> <p>All the men were a couple of years younger than her husband, but they were certainly fit and energetic! A black couple of the guys at the bar were even prettier than their wives, with a couple of their long-haired wives and a couple of their wives, with short black hair and an even smaller but equally well-endowed Black woman. As they chatted the four black men were having a ball with their wives, who they had been invited to dance with. They were a couple of years younger than Jenny, as well, but as it turned out, both were pretty good looking.</p> <p>She found, quite simply, that they were very nice, with two blondes, a tall and very pretty blonde and a petite, but very sexy young black guy. They both had small breasts, and they appeared to be wearing very tight tops with no bra. Their faces, however, were pretty, with light brown eyes and short blonde hair. One of the guys behind them introduced Jenny to the big-time bartender, Gary, an older, good-looking, older black guy named Steve. Steve asked that she go back to them and he would be happy to pay for her, so that she could go on her own time and be alone with them. Jenny was pretty impressed with what Steve was offering as she took Steve's money, told him that she had already lost her husband, and told her husband, in his own language, that she had always wanted to go out to a dance. When she had asked Steve to come with her, he laughed and told her that he thought maybe she ought to do that for someone else, too.</p> <p>Jenny had to fight her desire to leave at least one dance partner alone, with a guy there and not at a bar! She really loved the variety of dancing experiences around the strip, and she had found that there were only 2 dances a day when she had been working at the strip joint. She and Steve had enjoyed a couple of dances and then came back to Steve to dance with him. Then Steve came over and asked her if she was sure that a guy like him would want to dance. She told him that she was not a dancer and he laughed and told her that his wife would know when he should leave early! Now he was really going to be happy to pay for her. They started back to their table, and it was several minutes later before anyone else came back to see if she was okay, or wanted another dance.</p> <p>The guy at the bar had gone to the Ladies' room, but it was still early. They decided to get some rest, and when they went out into the pool to the back for "a few minutes," Jenny went to get Steve and Gary. She found that Steve had gone to the back of the room to the restrooms, and she took a long time to get back there. She went to one of the restrooms and relieved herself before heading back again.</p> <p>Jenny was sitting by one of the tables with a glass of wine in her hand, when a guy came out of the restroom with a large smile on his face.</p> <p>"Wow, what a surprise!" exclaimed the guy who had been to the restroom, not noticing that Jenny was sitting alone on the bar stool. "It looks like you got lucky today!"</p> <p>"I think so," chuckled Jenny. "It was fun, but after a few drinks, I can't say I haven't had a little fun, even with Steve. Now I have to find somebody, so I better get back to my room or I'm going to leave!"</p> <p>Jenny said to the guy sitting by her, "I'll let you get back to the restroom before you leave, but Steve will not leave until I get back to my room. OK?"</p> <p>"Sure," he said, with his eyes on Jenny's lovely breasts and lovely legs. And not just those legs. He had a big smile on his face and his arm was very obviously around her shoulders, as far as she could tell.</p> <p>As she walked back to her own room, Jenny heard Steve say, "Damn, she likes being nude!"</p> <p>She stopped and just sat there and sippedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
