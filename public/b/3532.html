"I can't wait to see the expression on your face and your happy eyes as you smile at me."</p> <p>The phone chirped. "Who, my friend? Sorry, I'm on my way."</p> <p>"I'll come down immediately," she said. "Come on; if you're too shy, you can give me your number. We both know your roommate is waiting in her dorm for me."</p> <p>"You really are an evil woman; I don't think I can wait."</p> <p>She smiled. "Are you ready for dinner?</p> <p>"I'll take about half an hour. Do you want to make it, or should I take the car?"</p> <p>"No, we'll wait here for a while. I'm not dressed too much; I'd just as soon as I get my shoes on, get in the back, and wait for my friend."</p> <p>"Is she good? She looks amazing."</p> <p>"You'll be surprised. She is not even a looker. Do you know a lot? She has a rack. I'm sure she's pretty good in bed."</p> <p>"She is pretty good I suppose, but she's got an evil edge to her."</p> <p>The elevator was only a short walk down, when we reached the end of the hallway. I could see that I'd missed the last room on the first floor. When that door opened into the main part of the first floor, we entered the building's elevator lobby. I was expecting to find her there, but she said there was someone to my left, so I guessed she wasn't in the building. It was a nice room, had a bar in the middle, a balcony overlooking the lobby and below the elevator where we could easily see the view, and it had a nice big bed with a canopy bed in each corner.</p> <p>She pulled her car into the garage. She got out of the car, put on her jacket, and began walking towards me. She was wearing a white blouse and black slacks under a tight skirt. She said, "I was wondering if you'd show up for a little dinner before..."</p> <p>"I'll do that," I said. "I'd love to be there for the presentation of my plan for the following Wednesday." Then I added, "I hope you liked my presentation."</p> <p>"It was very inspiring—and a very enlightening project."</p> <p>She reached up and touched my cheek. Then she kissed me and said "Thank you for taking the time to talk with me. Now we are going to have a date."</p> <p>And she kissed me again... again... and again... as our two tongues intertwined. I put my arms around her, lifted her chair away and gave her a big kiss and another long French kiss as I put my hands along her ass. I lifted her skirt to cup and feel her ass.</p> <p>She stopped short when she realized we were no longer kissing. "We are just getting ready to go." And she stood up, buttoned off her blouse and dropped her bra on the table. Her nipples were already hard and her pussy was wet.</p> <p>She led me by the hand to the door.</p> <p>I pushed the door open. We walked into the hallway. She grabbed my hand, led me to the elevator and we went up to the fourth floor, where the lights were already on. She walked me to her door, opened it, and I put my arm around her. Our lips found one another and we kissed for a long time.</p> <p>Suddenly, she took my head in her hands. "What's this?" she asked.</p> <p>I kissed her lips so hard that she was going to pass out in my arms. I stood up right there in front of her. I kissed her again and again and felt my heart leap a bit.</p> <p>"I've got to pee," she said. "Let me go."</p> <p>I grabbed my towel and said "No."</p> <p>She stepped back, pushed me into the bathroom, and closed the door. She pulled my pants and underwear down. I was surprised at the lack of a pee fetish: she had already seen to my erection by taking down my pants and underwear by squatting on the toilet. She pulled my briefs down and my cock sprang out. She said "Oh, my!" with a giggle.</p> <p>I quickly stepped into the bathroom—I must have put my cock up her ass and she had taken in my fully erect erection. She turned to close the door, I stepped back, she quickly closed the door and we both stood in the doorway, legs locked. We stared at each other, then we began kissing again.</p> <p>We embraced long, slow-moving kisses. She was breathing heavily and her breath was coming in big waves. I caressed her back and—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
