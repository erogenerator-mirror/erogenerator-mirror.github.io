You know you're married and will never be able to break him out of you. That was what happened the last time."</p> <p>"He was in trouble when she had to go home with her sister. Did he see you again?"</p> <p>"No, he drove home drunk."</p> <p>"So he's gone again on business?"</p> <p>"No, he's with one of his boys. They're going to be back on Sunday. You're going to make him come over then too."</p> <p>"Yeah, that's the thought."</p> <p>"Okay, I'll see you later. Thanks for the flowers and your hospitality.</p> <p>"That's all I'm saying."</p> <p>"Goodbye."</p> <p>I hung up the phone. I walked into the kitchen and sat myself down at the table. I sipped the wine and tried to catch my breath. I hadn't expected anything in it.</p> <p>"You look a little beat."</p> <p>"I look forward to it."</p> <p>"Are you okay?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I am."</p> <p>"Would you like me to take you out to dinner?"</p> <p>"That would be nice. But let's keep it short and to the point."</p> <p>I thought about how I felt about her at the weekend. I was getting close to coming to the weekend. Why had she let things get out of control? I'd have called her up, told her what I'd done but we hadn't worked out anything. I was still struggling to believe that she wasn't cheating on me.</p> <p>I told myself that she'd be the one to blame if something really heated between us. She certainly wouldn't be able to get away with that. I was beginning to wonder what'd happened. I was becoming depressed just thinking about it.</p> <p>I had a lot to think about. My last thought was that she'd done a bad thing by getting carried away. I didn't have much experience with people from that perspective. At any rate, I couldn't imagine living like that any more.</p> <p>It wasn't that we were too close. It was just the fact that we were both married and she wasn't getting close to me now either. I wasn't sure that I was getting close. The sex couldn't come on too fast and with the right person it wouldn't be long before it might.</p> <p>When I came home from working and the kids and found my wife still there at the house, I tried to find out how she was. I did a little digging through my house and found nothing. I called my boss and told him that I had a meeting that wasn't going to be coming until I found out more. I got up and went on home so that I could check her over. I found that I was having a hard time. I really needed to talk to her. I could only hope she wasn't unhappy with what I had done. I'd probably just lose her anyway.</p> <p>I stopped by the grocery store, bought some cheese, ham and a container of potato salad. I tried to convince myself that I didn't want anything. I really did like the salad. I had it prepared and had a little time before getting ready to take a shower and get ready for dinner.</p> <p>I turned on a hot bath trying to relax a little. I soaked in the bath for several minutes with the bathroom a little larger than my apartment. I hadn't cleaned thoroughly since I left my wife the night before. It helped a little. When I was finished, I put on some clean clothes and went to find my wife.</p> <p>"I took a shower."</p> <p>"I know you did."</p> <p>"Yes you did but I wanted to go back to mine. It smells nice this time."</p> <p>"It smells fantastic. You're spoiling me."</p> <p>"Not really."</p> <p>I was trying to stay as cool as I could but my hands were shaking and I wasn't sure whether this was going to be a good or a bad time.</p> <p>"I had just got done when you came home."</p> <p>"Well I took my shower. You're the reason that I never get out of bed."</p> <p>"I don't know about that."</p> <p>I didn't want to hurt her feelings.</p> <p>"I guess that we should clean up. There aren't any dishes and we don't have any clean clothes."</p> <p>"I didn't have clean clothes when we got here."</p> <p>"That didn't mean much anymore but it still counts. Now, I've got some work to do, you got to go."</p> <p>"Okay, I'm goingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
