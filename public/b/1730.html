I love you," I said with all sincerity.</p> <p>She hugged me even tighter, and sobbed into my chest harder.</p> <p>I felt her tears soaking through my shirt. She was obviously crying because of what she said. We held each other. I was really worried and even nervous because this could not be.</p> <p>"I love you," I said. Her entire body tightened around me, and a few seconds later she relaxed.</p> <p>"Thank you," She said through a very shaky breath.</p> <p>"No, thank you," I said.</p> <p>"I know," She smiled. I hugged her so tightly that I almost couldn't breathe. She let out a small, short laugh.</p> <p>"It's nice," She said, almost shyly. Then she hugged me hard again, and whispered, "I love you."</p> <p>We held each other as we both went quiet for a bit, still not believing what was happening. After a few seconds she said, "When can we be together?"</p> <p>I smiled down at her in awe. "I can't wait for it to take place."</p> <p>She leaned her head back and smiled, but when she looked at me again she said, "I'm getting pretty stressed."</p> <p>"I think we probably won't make it today."</p> <p>She laughed again, "Don't worry. I'm sure all will be well." She looked away from me, and gave me a huge smile. "I would love for you to be my best friend forever."</p> <p>"No!" I said, "I can't."</p> <p>"Do you seriously think you want to leave me now that you know my real name?" She asked, still smiling.</p> <p>"If it doesn't work out between us, I'll tell your boyfriend."</p> <p>"What would he say?"</p> <p>"Tell him you love my dad?"</p> <p>My eyes widened. I started to say, "My father."</p> <p>"And what happens between you and him?"</p> <p>I sighed and looked up at her. "I'll tell him that you're gay."</p> <p>She smiled and threw her head back, and laughed, "Good. You'll see that it's better to let him know right then!"</p> <p>Just then it was the best thing ever. We got dressed and went to take breakfast. When breakfast was over the conversation got quiet, and then when we got back to reality I realized why that smile on her face was still there. I didn't want to look at her again after that. The smile just took on a whole new meaning for me.</p> <p>In retrospect, she was right: I knew I loved her. Yes, I loved her, even though she wasn't actually a lesbian. But in reality, she was still my best friend. But it took me a while to fall into a romantic routine.</p> <p>And as I thought about this a lot more, I noticed that she had a very beautiful face. When I looked at her I didn't feel very guilty. I didn't think of her as anything else than my best friend; but if I had the time of my life, I'd probably take it now and take her for granted. But then again, I always felt like I'd done the right thing.</p> <p>The very next day after breakfast, I went up to my room to get my computer. I had some work to do in college in college. I was just about done. I was still in my room when I found a note that I'd printed to my old school for last year.</p> <p>To my surprise and delight, it read, "It's too bad that you were able to attend college last year at the last, but I couldn't find you. I know I would have been devastated if I hadn't."</p> <p>I smiled at the contented sound. The message was a good reason to forget where I was.
