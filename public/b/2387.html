"Yes, hello" I said.</p> <p>"I just wanted to see you for a minute. It's been a long time."</p> <p>"Oh, yes, it has. You remember the guy who was really nice at the party?"</p> <p>"The one who told me I might as well get to know him again before I let you go?" I replied.</p> <p>"He's been nice and friendly, and we've really not been in a proper family for too long. He's never been much about doing the right thing so he wasn't happy when I brought up my sex life."</p> <p>"It was a nice party. They were nice people." I said.</p> <p>"Yes, but then I heard stories that I shouldn't be thinking." Kitten responded.</p> <p>"Oh, the sex talk at the party was a bit strange, but you'd never know by anyone else. Did he tell a stranger of your sexual interests?"</p> <p>"He had a number of his friends. It was obvious. It was something I didn't want to give up on you for someone I didn't know. But I was really confused about my attraction to him. He was very nice and he seemed good at his job. He offered me a free meal. We talked a little." Kitten said.</p> <p>"So was that good for him?"</p> <p>"Yes, very much. I could see he loved me. But a lot of the people were a little weirded out." Kitten said.</p> <p>"Well, in the past I've done really good in training." I said. "Did you know that I had gone all the way with an older woman?" I asked.</p> <p>"Not exactly! I mean, I would have been more than happy to have a younger man be my companion. The way you were looking at him was one of the most attractive things in the world to me."</p> <p>"Honey, if you knew that that was true, would you have ever made it with another man?" I asked.</p> <p>"Honey, let's just say that I would most certainly have given you the opportunity." Kitten said with a laugh. "Would you have done the same thing for someone you didn't know?" I teased her.</p> <p>"That would be true, but a gentleman can never be one to share his conquests forever."</p> <p>"No, I would not have asked." I said. "And you wouldn't mind sharing mine if I got to know you."</p> <p>"I would be happy to." she said.</p> <p>After I had hung up the phone, I took a shower and went to bed. The evening was going to go along nicely with my anticipation. I was already aroused. I had been on edge since Friday afternoon with that girl from accounting that night. My dreams were getting progressively more erotic. I felt an extra twinge of sexual energy. I could also feel a certain level of excitement in the anticipation of Kitten's return. I had been attracted to her since that other night in the accounting dorm. And I knew that she had an attraction to me.</p> <p>That evening was a blur. Even though all too soon I was back at my desk, ready to get through the day and take care of the last few customers. I wanted to spend my days doing some work.</p> <p>Just before I came home from lunch, I realized that I wasn't alone in my bed. I heard voices coming from Kitten's room. I couldn't make out any of her words. She must have been in bed with some of her friends. I got up to check in on her. It sure sounded like Kitten. I could really hear her giggling a little. It reminded me of the time she had with one of her old students. Those stories about boys getting caught with other girls and getting out of class and leaving them to cry on campus had been pretty explicit.</p> <p>I sat down at my desk and started to type some papers. I knew where she was in her room. I wanted a sense of being able to identify her without her noticing. My fingers lingered for a moment or half a minute and I could see the shadows in the mirror opposite the bed in her room. I glanced down at my hands as my fingers traced the outline of my erection through my shorts.</p> <p>"Excuse me. I was just about to sign some papers." Kitten said in a small voice.</p> <p>Before I could say anything further, and after looking at her, she rushed into the bathroom, got a towel and wrapped it around her body but left the door ajar. If she had left the door even partially closed, I couldn't tell for sure. I heard her giggle as she came back out.</p> <p>"This is nice.
