"What are we saying, pet?" he said again, this time without a trace of a smile, which she returned and was rewarded with a slow smile from him.</p> <p>He began kissing up her neck as his hands moved over her breasts. He kissed up her sternum, and she cooed and groaned, as their hands roamed all over each other's bodies, exploring every inch of each other's body. He kissed and nibbled on her ears. He bit it lightly and moved his mouth down a bit. He teased her earlobes with his teeth. She shuddered. The sounds of pleasure were becoming ever louder within her body. She could feel her clitoris get ever harder and it began to strain between her thighs.</p> <p>He stopped the torture he had started, placing his wet mouth directly on her breasts. He slowly and deliberately kissed her nipples, leaving her moaning softly and moving her hands along his head. She moaned and moved faster against him, as she could feel the impending orgasm building inside her. He put his left arm around her, moving it slowly up and pulling her down with it. He moved his right hand so that he could have access to her pussy. She moaned a bit more and moved her hips in response. Her hands moved down his body and around his cock. He placed his right hand over her mound and began working his index and middle finger in and out of her pussy.</p> <p>He started to kiss down her torso and down her stomach, before moving his head back up and down her other body, now taking notice of their movement against each other. He began kissing down the inside of her hip and down again to her thigh. His hands moved to the inside of her hips and back to the inside of her thigh...he pulled back slightly and looked her eye-to-eye...</p> <p>She moved to kneel between his legs, which he reached out and grabbed. She looked up at him and smiled shyly, before he pulled her into his arms and kissed her, pressing their bodies together once again. His tongue probed at her mouth, as his cock poked out at her from behind. She began to move against him and kissed him even more.</p> <p>She could feel herself start to come, as waves of sensations swept all over her body. As her orgasm approached, she reached in between her own legs and grabbed his cock and began stroking it hard again. She could feel his cock getting harder and harder in her hand as she moved. She wanted that cock inside of her, so she leaned forward and kissed him, letting her tongue explore his mouth for a second.</p> <p>He pulled away from her as she had one last chance to go. He picked her up with the other hand and sat down on the couch to pull her astride of him, his cock at her pussy. He reached up and put his hands around her hips, and began stroking them. He moved her body so that her pussy was almost over his cock, and looked at her beautiful face. He leaned over to kiss her again, letting his tongue play with her.</p> <p>He brought his head up again, and she could feel the warm breath on the side of her face as he began to kiss her, working his way slowly down her neck. She tried to move forward but he placed a hand on her shoulders and pulled her back against something. She stopped moving and let his cock move in a circle around her pussy lips, rubbing up and down the side of them, before returning the feeling of his cock pressing up against her lips and moving into her a bit farther. He stopped stroking her for a second, leaving his cock a good distance away from her pussy.</p> <p>He pulled himself out of her and kneeled for her to straddle his cock. It slid into her slowly, before he pulled away completely. It took her a few minutes to get comfortable. He reached up and grabbed her right breast, his thumb on her nipple as he pulled away. He squeezed it a bit, making her moan. He did this until she was comfortable and moved his hands back to her boobs. She leaned forward to rest his cock at the opening of her pussy, and pushed her hips forward. He entered her slowly, feeling her muscles wrapping around him, as he moved within her.</p> <p>He pulled almost all the way out, and pressed the head into her pussy, pushing in once again. He slid in all the way. She let out a moan of pleasure. He slid out and in again, building her up almost to a quivering point, building her confidence. He started to roll his hips, and felt her hips move back against him, matching him stroke for stroke. He looked up at her face again and smiled. She smiled back, still in a state of arousalâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
