It bobbed up and down, with her hand gripping her hair tightly. Her feet slipped in and out of the couch seat's thick cushioning, making it nearly impenetrable as her legs slipped apart.</p> <p>Fingers pressed inside Karen's panties and slipped against her wet pussy lips as more of Jenny's fingers slid in. Jenny's ass gripped a pillow with its firm, round cheeks; fingers sliding past the top, slipping down.</p> <p>The wetness of Karen's pussy was running down the crack to soak the couch cushion's back cushion.</p> <p>A hand pressed against her cunt lips as it slid inside. Karen's body trembled as her hand slid over her clitoris. It made a loud 'crack' noise as one of the fingers slid all the way inside her.</p> <p>The hand pressing against her tits felt so good.</p> <p>"Damn that feel good?"</p> <p>"Oh, god yes!"</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me!"</p> <p>A hot mouth pressed down on her ear as Karen's body jerked on the couch. Her hand was pressing harder, her nails digging into Karen's back.</p> <p>"Oh fuck, I gotta fuck!"</p> <p>Jenny stood up, her hands cupping her breasts. Her nipples were hard points through the material of her T-shirt.</p> <p>"Fuck me!"</p> <p>Karen's hips ground against the couch cushion; her hand slid to her mouth.</p> <p>"Let me fuck you."</p> <p>"Let me fuck you, hard!"</p> <p>Jenny slid into the middle of the couch and laid her head down between Karen's legs. Her lips and tongue dove into her pussy like some kind of starving beast.</p> <p>"Oh, shit!" Karen's body convulsed again around Jenny's fingers.</p> <p>Her body bucked on the couch.</p> <p>"Fuck me, fuck me!"</p> <p>More fingers entered Karen and a third slid from her pussy. Her whole body shuddered again, as she had the first time.</p> <p>Jenny slid her fingers inside of her and let out a long shudder.</p> <p>Karen went limp in her arms, barely breathing. Her body tensed and jerked, her face flushed and eyes half closed.</p> <p>Jenny's hips rose and fell against her hand.</p> <p>"I'll be back."</p> <p>"No!"</p> <p>Jenny laughed.</p> <p>"Please."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>A sudden realization hit Karen. The sound that came from the door was coming from the room and she had her back against the wall.</p> <p>"No, no, no."</p> <p>Karen had barely closed her eyes. A new awareness of where her clothes were had formed and where her body belonged came to her mind.</p> <p>Jenny slipped her fingers from her body and turned to the door.</p> <p>She looked back at Karen and smiled.</p> <p>"Don't worry about it, it's okay."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"Hey Karen, can I ask you something?"</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"What's that?"</p> <p>"Can you have sex with me?"</p> <p>Jenny stood to the side of her. She didn't seem as nervous at not having sex as Karen; in fact, she looked very sexy. She had long red hair and her skin was a perfect shade of cocoa. Her hips were curved upward and her breasts were perky. The shape of her breasts were large and full.</p> <p>"I mean...if you want to."</p> <p>"No, it's not so bad. I mean, we're just doing what we were doing before."</p> <p>"Oh, okay."</p> <p>"Great. I'll get into the bedroom. I'll be right back."</p> <p>She slipped her pants and panties off and stood to the side. She wasn't wearing any make-up but rather wore pink, eye-liner with white lace and black. Karen's eyes lingered just above her mouth as they lingered there.</p> <p>The door closed, leaving an open, silent door and Karen stood there unsure of what to do. Jenny slid down the wall and stood on her other side from where she stood behind her.</p> <p>She could sense what Karen wanted from her. She turned her back sideways to Jenny and put her legs against the side. Her knees, still raised up, came under the couch as Karen's knees rested on both sides of her sides. Jenny had her ass pulled off the couch cushion. Her legs were spread wide. Her hands cupped her breasts and squeezed them together.</p> <p>Jenny's knees were bent forward as she faced the door. Her legs spread.</p> <p>"Is Karen coming in?"</p> <p>"Yes!" Karen whimpered to Jenny's voice.</p> <p>"Is that what youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
