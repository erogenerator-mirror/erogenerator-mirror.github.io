He'd probably get pissed and get a good spanking himself. I also wanted to do something, really something, really dirty. If he was in the mood, I suppose I'd like to do it.</p> <p>As a matter of fact, he was in the mood, but we didn't do anything until we were home. I got off the bed, took the toy in hand, and told him to fuck me.</p> <p>I put my body on top of his, bent over, my ass in his face, and began to spank my ass. If I was really good, perhaps, I would be able to make myself scream. The only thing I wanted to do was to get my husband to fuck me. I would probably be too sore from my pussy for it, but his cock would never quite fit.</p> <p>I spanked so hard that I began to feel my face reddening. I told him to fuck, fuck, fuck, and fuck. I would, indeed, make myself scream with pleasure. I made my body spank like that while I fucked, and as I did so, he started to come. His cock jerked like never before, and he came like a volcano. He came in spurts, and I felt his spurts hitting my back and legs. He began to apologize, and I pulled him up to me, wrapped my arms around him, and said, "Don't be sorry, sweetie...that's all I ask you for, I don't care what you think."</p> <p>When his cock was still hard, I climbed up onto the bed. I straddled him, and took the toy back in my mouth. A minute or so later, I got up straight again, took him in my hand, and got him hard again, again, and we made love again a couple of times. I took the toy from his hand, and guided it into my pussy. I put one, and then another finger inside, all the way up inside me at one point, and then back out. He moaned while I was fucking him, and that brought me to another orgasm. I knew it would take a little getting used to, but my husband, and I, both enjoyed being watched while having sex.</p> <p>When I came down from that last high, I found that a lot of the vibrator's stimulation on my clit had me coming once or twice more, and still come, almost every time. It was more than I had hoped for. When he told me that he got off from the toy alone, but to use the remote, and then the remote in my pussy, I got off the bed, sat over him, pulled the toy out, turned it on, and began to masturbate while I watched. I made the vibrator touch me as close as I dared. I made sure it was so close that I was touching my pussy and asshole while masturbating. I went over the edge with a powerful orgasm with little effort and with a little noise in my throat as I came again. I was coming like a water drum.</p> <p>When my head was almost over him again, I asked, "How many others have you got tonight before I come home? Who knows?"</p> <p>"Only you," he said sleepily. "Only you."</p> <p>For an extra hour, I kept the vibrator up, watched, masturbated, and then made love to him, making love to him until I couldn't do it anymore. Twice more, I brought him to his third orgasm, but then left him. He slept well until I got up, and we didn't talk much, just enough to remember what we were going to do tomorrowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
