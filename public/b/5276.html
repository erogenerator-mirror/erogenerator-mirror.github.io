"That's what I'm feeling about your dad."</p> <p>There was a silence, and then it changed to a long moan.</p> <p>"Mom... I'm sorry," I said again, but I was afraid that the sound of it would ruin the mood that we'd had for the last couple of days.</p> <p>I couldn't find the words to say to reassure her, and she just moaned again, this time louder.</p> <p>"Oh, please, baby," she muttered, before pulling her body away from mine, looking into my eyes. "Please don't be nervous. I'm still upset at how you feel about the whole incest thing, but since you're here I feel that maybe we both made a mistake."</p> <p>My heart was breaking at the idea that my mother was taking me to her for her first fuck. There was just no way I was leaving to see her again. But after that we weren't fighting much at all. She put her hands around my neck and slowly and softly, and started to pull herself free of my body. I got up and helped her, and then we kissed again.</p> <p>"What's wrong, mom?" I asked, as her eyes glazed over. She still didn't seem to want to go fuck but she finally said, "I... I want to but... I'm not sure how."</p> <p>I gave her a mischievous grin as I pulled the comforter away from the bed and pushed her up off her knees, and then got on the bed with her, pulling her closer to me.</p> <p>"Just think, we both know that there are other things that make me so happy," I whispered in her ear, and I kissed down her neck to her shoulder, then down her upper arm, and then back up her arm, making an occasional move across to her other shoulder, and back up to kiss her again.</p> <p>We continued to French kiss, our tongues touching as we made out. Mom broke away, then, "Oh, baby... I'm nervous now."</p> <p>I chuckled, "I could kiss you forever," I said. She laughed back, so I wrapped my arms around her, and then started to kiss her neck again. She made another groan in the back of her throat as I started to slowly kiss down onto the top of her t-shirt, before moving to her left tit. I felt her inhale deeply as I kissed across her areola, and I watched the color deepen as I kissed her nipple, making it very hard.</p> <p>"Oh, god," she softly breathed as I kissed my way slowly down to her stomach, and then slowly lowered to her right breast. She put both hands on my head, and then pulled my head down between her breasts with one hand, "Oh... oh... baby," she moaned, "Baby..." she whimpered, and I continued to kiss her breasts, starting at the one nearest the tip of her nipple, and kissing from the other side of her nipple across her tits to her neck as she leaned forward into my arms, moaning louder as I did so.</p> <p>I kissed down through her waistline, then to her belly, kissing the soft skin there as I neared her waistband. I slowly pulled her jeans down her legs, and she helped with the zipper, and then helped me when I finally got around to pull both her pants and panties off down in one motion.</p> <p>I kissed down her left side before kissing her right side, before kneeling down, I looked up at her and smiled, "Do you want to take off your bra, mom?" I was just wondering if she was on the pill, but she said, "Yes, baby." I looked up at her, my hand stroking the skin of her thigh. "No," she said quietly, "It's OK... I'm on the pill."</p> <p>I smiled, looking into her eyes, and then kissed my way along her left thigh to her right. Her skin was almost bare now, and I loved the way it glowed in the light. I looked up into her beautiful eyes and breathed on her lips, making her inhale sharply, before licking her slightly parted lips, making her body shiver. I kissed down one side of her belly, a slow, deliberate move making her entire body tremble as I did so, and even more so when I kissed along the edge of her pubic hair and I heard her let out a gasp of surprise.</p> <p>A tiny sound started to get louder when I kissed her left outer lip, and I ran my tongue down and then over her outer lips, getting her ever hotter. Her back arched, and I ran my tongue over the entire area of her outer lip. When my tongue reached the very top of her outer lip, my hand cupped one of her breasts, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
