It's not every place."</p> <p>"You don't need to mention that, so here is my address. If you think you need a 'phone, call me.' It's right around the corner."</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, sure."</p> <p>She gave me a quick smile and a quick kiss and handed me a piece of paper. I checked it and it said she had to leave in 10 minutes. She had to come in the front door and I had to find another way to get to her. I looked up at the house, a million thoughts ran through my mind but I didn't know if I wanted to go with her even if we could. My mind was clouded with fear for her and I could never bring myself to say goodbye before I knew it. The phone call was over and I felt better.</p> <p>"Where the hell are you? I haven't seen you in quite a while."</p> <p>"I'm at home. Did you want to talk?" She had her hand on my cheek and her eyes closed, her head leaning against the side of mine.</p> <p>"It was nice talking to you, and I would like to keep talking to you."</p> <p>"No, I'm not a friend of your wife or any of your friends. I'm a patient man and I want answers. Can I call you in a few minutes?"</p> <p>"I really don't know if I'm comfortable talking to you in this condition."</p> <p>"I can see how it is, but the sooner the better. I'm trying to be patient with you, but I'm not as patient as the good doctor he is."</p> <p>"I'm on the pill now."</p> <p>She gave me a soft smile and said "I'll call you in a few minutes."</p> <p>I took the check and as I was walking back to my room I was filled with dread. What was she going to say or even if she wanted me to stay at her house, was my choice now. What if this was too soon, or did she just want to get home? She would be on birth control. At that moment I was worried sick. I'd have to get rid of this mental image before it could be seen again. I finished off my papers and left the office closing the door softly behind me.</p> <p>I sat staring for a few minutes, my mind replaying every second. I didn't talk to her or her husband, and I didn't have a good relationship with her and the kids either. What kind of husband was he? And why was she being so nice to him? I knew she wasn't a bad person, but she seemed so upset and angry as if I had just made a mistake that had ruined her wonderful first marriage. It was like her life had just gone away forever and I didn't know why I was making it worse. I had made love to a pretty girl, and I had gotten fucked right in her bed. I was worried. I was hurting and upset, and scared.</p> <p>My fingers drifted to my crotch where my cock was starting to harden. I thought of Becky, of meeting her. Why had she gotten such a tight grip on me after all these months? I turned off all light, turned on the alarm clock, closed everything out and tucked the box of Viagras in its package. I was so worried, I didn't know what she was going to say when she found out I was pregnant. The best I could do was try and hold myself together and hope for the best and not tell her. I tried to think of the best thing to do, but she told me no, it was just business. Even now, the worst part is, I didn't feel the same way.</p> <p>I finally woke up the next morning to the feeling that my body was still attached to me, even if I couldn't admit it. I was naked, still on my stomach, my hair on my shoulders, my legs crossed, and my arms outstretched. I looked up at the bright early afternoon sun and noticed my cock had gone down. I looked around and then smiled when I felt a tug on my hair. I heard a whisper in my ear and looked up to see her smiling down at me, her hand on my neck and she was looking me deep in the eye.</p> <p>"It's about time you got up, I want to get lunch."</p> <p>Before I could make any decisions I felt her hand lower my back to the bed, and gently tug on my earlobe. For a few minutes she talked in whispered tones to me, and then the only sound in the world was the sound of her walking away. I could hear the crinkle of her clothes and realized that she was probably getting ready to leave my room or downstairs and I felt horribleâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
