I'm a retired member of the community, with a reputation of being quite the liberal thinker," she replied. "How do you feel?"</p> <p>"It's strange, really, but I'm still a bit unsettled about my future. After I lose the office and my reputation with the public, I'm afraid I'll lose everything."</p> <p>"That shouldn't be," she replied. "I just want to be certain that you understand and trust us. We would never do anything to hurt your feelings, and we wouldn't do anything if you think we are being unreasonable."</p> <p>"I understand," he responded seriously. "Thank you for being honest with me. I have no idea what is going on outside of what we discussed over the phone."</p> <p>They spent the morning working away and discussing various problems and problems in the field of marketing and advertising. After a couple of hours, it was decided it would be best that Erin get some sleep before her meeting the following day. They both agreed that it was a safe option. After Erin got in bed she was happy to finally be able to think clearly.</p> <p>As she drifted off to dreamy sleep, her first priority was to let the stress of her experience and her situation sink in so that it could make her feel better. She had thought about what the worst thing she could have done was to allow him the opportunity to seduce her, but that would only get worse as time went on. She was now looking forward to finally meeting his standards of behavior. They had agreed that there was no reason he wouldn't find her attractive and that it would be fun to see if they could make each other happy.</p> <p>She awoke at about 7:30 and went for a quick shower. When she emerged she was completely naked and sporting a wet, swollen pussy. She also had a large, distended nipple in view of it. She smiled to herself, recalling the events in her mind as she dried. She remembered that, for some reason, she had forgotten her panties, so she picked them up and put them in her purse, along with her purse handle. Her nipples still felt very hard as she rubbed the wet pair back and forth on each nipple. As she was still fully dressed, she slipped on her nightie, knowing he could clearly see the moisture on the thin strip of material that barely covered her mons and pussy.</p> <p>She was glad to finally be out of bed when she heard the sounds of the door to his bedroom getting closer. He was already on the computer, working on something on his PC. She closed her bedroom door as quietly as she could without him hearing her and then walked over to his room and sat next to him on his bed. He was fast asleep and she was glad to have him there. She closed the door, stood up and looked over at him as she began to slowly undress. Once she was nude she moved over toward the bed and sat on the end. She had her back to him when he turned away and left his computer off.</p> <p>She quickly began to unbutton her blouse, watching as he did so from her window. She knew he could see her nipples clearly through the thin material as they moved with the motion of her fingers over them. As the blouse finished its' journey, she stopped and turned so her back was to him without her legs to hide her obvious state. She reached behind the thin material of her nightie and pulled it off her shoulders, giving him a good view of her upper body. Once removed she unbuttoned and unzipped her skirt, removing it as she did so. She turned away from him, leaving the top of her panties on her right leg. Next, she reached behind her, undid the clasp on the waistband of her panties, sliding the zipper down, slipping them off her legs.</p> <p>She turned to face him, her breasts still very firm and high. She stood up, reached behind her back, and opened the zipper of her bra. Her tits were very firm, without the slightest hint of sag. As the bra slid from her shoulders she cupped each in her hands, offering her breasts to him in her palms. She leaned into him, kissing him deeply before raising her hands to his shirt, rubbing her thumb over his nipples before she ran her hands down to his lower abdomen and back up. She bent over at the waist as she unfastened the button and fly in front of him. She slowly slid his zipper down, allowing his cock to escape as her hands reached the waistband of his pants. She gently grabbed his cock, stroking it lightly and looking over her shoulder at him seductively.</p> <p>She continued to run her hands all over his body as she stepped back, allowing his cock to reach its' own full stature in anticipation of her touch. She slowly knelt on the bedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
