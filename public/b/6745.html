The older woman came and went back to the woman's room.</p> <p>I followed them and I found the two women at the bar enjoying their drinks. One of the older women had her eyes crossed and I had a hard time being calm, and the other, in my mind, was looking out the window. The two women talked as my attention focused on the older woman. I could see in the darkened window that she had removed her bra and was pulling down her panties. Both women were very smooth. They were very different than the young girls and they looked very sexy in the way that their bodies were built. I wondered if they were all real, like Jennifer and Sally, but I had no idea. A little over six feet I guessed, and a big bust. Not skinny, but not skinny, and maybe some muscle, but I still hadn't figured that out.</p> <p>The two older ladies, and they were obviously watching me, looked over as I approached them. I was just wearing a loose T-shirt. The two women were sitting side by side leaning against the sofa. Each had a drink in either hand and as I approached, one of them offered me a sip. I declined it and sat between them. I started to tell them about my life during high school, about my family, what I had done that summer. The older woman kept looking at me. Her hand went from hand to hand and I noticed her fingers moving, but they were not moving.</p> <p>"I see you're still single right? I'm sure there was some pretty wild sex when I heard that you and Jennifer were getting together at the time. Do you want to get out and have a drink now or might my boss go and ask for the room?"</p> <p>The woman's hand fell away from her lap. "I don't think that's such a good idea. I'm sure we can find something else here, if my boss will come by and see you."</p> <p>It was very unusual for her to even talk to me. It was almost more interesting watching my wife and my boss come to the place to spend a night on the town, but it was all I could do from concentrating. Then the younger woman piped up, "I think we can find a night club or two that works just fine. Let's get a drink first, and then see what works."</p> <p>The two women got up and were gone. The two older women, and I were still there, stood talking, looking at each other. Their hands were in their laps. If they were going to get it on, they were going to get it in one of the many, many more places on the way back to the office. And the older woman's fingers were moving very gently, a lot, and she was looking at me. I watched her, a little, watching her. I liked her. She really did look great. The younger lady, who was staring at me, just sort of, well, looking at her, almost looked as if she knew what she was looking at. I smiled at her.</p> <p>We finished our drinks and the women walked to a corner table to sit down. They looked at each other, smiled, and nodded. "Thank you for the drink. Your not the kind of guy that drinks and drags women, but maybe you could do it again." And with that, they got up to leave.</p> <p>I looked at my wife. "I don't have a drink in me and the woman said that it was fine for me to go back to my room."</p> <p>"I could get you one before it closes. Come on, it doesn't look as if you're going to be sitting for quite a while."</p> <p>So we got up and I followed her. She led me to her apartment and opened the door. I stood there looking around. It looked small, maybe one room, probably not large, maybe six or seven. But it had a little light from the TV, and a bed. The carpet was soft and bare. It had a couple of small night stand lamps, and a huge mirror on the wall.</p> <p>"You're not going to need any makeup?" She said, and then leaned close and kissed me. It was very light, almost like lightening. She put both arms around me, and said, "Come on in."</p> <p>We moved into the room, and she locked the door. I walked across the room and then she turned and leaned against me. The lights were low, and the sofa was not much light. I felt her breasts press against me. I put my arms around her and she put hers on the back of my jacket. It felt strange, but very nice. There were several other soft things in the room with her, but I didn't pay much attention, until she bent down and weâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
