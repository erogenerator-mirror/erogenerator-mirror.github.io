She didn't even look up at me as she kissed me. We kissed deeply and deeply before we sat on either side of me. She stroked my hair and then turned around to kiss me. I could feel her breasts and ass against my bare chest and my cock started to rise again.</p> <p>"Fuck," she said, "I've been feeling that for you all day. Do you know what happens when you get to be half of your size?"</p> <p>"Well, what happens will happen, when you don't know."</p> <p>"If you like, you can play with my body again," she said softly. "When we make love, there's an element of adventure and adventure, too. Now go shower me. You can wash my back."</p> <p>I knew what was coming next, but at the same time wasn't sure about getting to fuck her again. I had a hard time concentrating as she put her arm around me and her head went around to kiss me softly. It wasn't a sexual move, only a warm-up after a long day of driving and all that.</p> <p>I watched from the doorway as a shower began. I couldn't see much in the kitchen, because of how much work it was going, but with the right person, the room was actually pretty clean.</p> <p>When the water finished, I opened my bedroom door and stepped into it, closing and locking it behind me. I turned to look at her. She was laying on my bed, her feet on the edge. I couldn't see her face in the bathroom as I approached the bed.</p> <p>"You like that," she said. "Do you want it again?"</p> <p>"I don't know," I said. I looked down at her as I walked toward her. I ran my eyes from her face on down to her neck, then to her breasts, her waist and her hips, my eyes then continued up to her face, "I guess that you do know."</p> <p>She nodded her head. I knelt beside the bed, turned her face to me and kissed her. We kissed as one person.</p> <p>"You can do anything you want to me, if you want to," she said. "But I just hope you have other plans for me tonight."</p> <p>"I will," I told her. "I'm going to get a shower now. If you want to join me, you just say so."</p> <p>"I have to go," she said. "I'll be back this afternoon. And, if I decide you want a shower or the massage, you have to agree to the full experience, like what happened today."</p> <p>I took her into my arms and kissed her again.</p> <p>"OK," I said, "I'm ready for some fun now."</p> <p>"Yeah," she said. "I don't know where to begin... I want to make sure everything goes very smoothly. I guess, as always, no pressure for anything. And, there's the whole thing about making sure things are OK because I'm going to need to make sure everything happens right."</p> <p>We kissed another long, lingering kiss and then she got up, went to the bathroom, closed the door, and then walked back into the hallway.</p> <p>I thought it best to follow her, so I turned around, reached down and pulled my shorts off, pulled off my shirt and stood waiting for her.</p> <p>She was looking at the tent my shorts had already formed in my shorts, and she took a step closer.</p> <p>"Come on. Sit down on the bed," she said to me. "We've got a long day ahead of us. Take this towel off so it's all dry and then lie down so you can get back on the bed when it's time for you to lie down.</p> <p>"I don't think it will take long," I said.</p> <p>"Well, I have more towels than I knew I would, but I'm sure I can find something that will do the trick. And, you'll have to trust me until you're ready to go again, if you're still with me."</p> <p>"I guess it won't take long. But you got to promise me that you aren't going to be able to let me down in bed again if I get out of control."</p> <p>"Yeah, you got me right where you wanted me. That's right. And, I promise that you will have all of your strength when we get to our next sessionâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
